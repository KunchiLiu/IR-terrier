	<brief_summary>Background : - The chemotherapy combination DA-EPOCH-RP include drug etoposide ( E ) , prednisone ( P ) , vincristine ( O ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , doxorubicin ( H ) , rituximab ( R ) , pomalidomide ( P ) . Researchers want see include pomalidomide help people two rare lymphoma . Objectives : - To study safety efficacy chemotherapy drug DA-EPOCH-RP . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old . They must primary effusion lymphoma large cell lymphoma arise Kaposi sarcoma Herpesvirus-associated multicentric Castleman disease . Design : - Participants screen blood test , scan , spinal tap , bone marrow sample . They may skin lymph node sample take fluid remove around organ . - Participants breathe eye test . A camera may take picture inside body . - Participants take pomalidomide alone mouth 21 day . Then get rituximab intravenous ( IV ) catheter , small tube go vein.. - Participants IV insert arm chest vein get IV chemotherapy drug , time take pomalidomide mouth 5 day . - They get DA-EPOCH-RP 21-day cycle . Most people 6 cycle . - They get 4 study drug IV 5 day 2 others mouth 5 day . - They get daily filgrastim injection skin white blood count acceptable - For 2 day cycle , methotrexate inject spinal fluid . - After complete EPOCH-RP , participant Kaposi sarcoma prescribe pomalidomide 3-weeks , follow one week break , 12 month . - Participants repeat blood test often . They also repeat medical history , physical exam , urine stool test , picture rash associate lymphoma . - Participants several follow-up visit 4 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pomalidomide Combined With Modified DA-EPOCH Rituximab KSHV-Associated Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ( KSHV ) -associated primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) large cell lymphoma arise KSHV-MCD aggressive B cell neoplasms clinicopathologic molecular profile distinct AIDS-related lymphoma . - There prospective study rare lymphoma . Clinical experience limit ; however , report prognosis poor , median survival estimate less 6 month use conventional CHOP-like chemotherapy . - Novel treatment urgently need KSHV-associated lymphoma , therapeutic approach must take account concurrent KSHV-associated malignancy commonly see patient population - Pomalidomide , immune-modulatory derivative ( IMiD ) thalidomide vitro direct antitumor effect KSHV-lymphomas well immune modulatory antiangiogenic effect may beneficial treat KSHV-NHL many patient , concurrent KS . - Rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , recently show active agent management KSHV-MCD . Although PEL CD20-negative tumor , advance understand biology KSHV-infection B-cells , pathobiology IL-6 syndromes KSHV-MCD KSHV-NHL , clinical experience use rituximab treatment KSHV-MCD support use rituximab treatment KSHV-NHL , especially patient concurrent KSHV-MCD . - Modified dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin ( DA ) -EPOCH anthracycline-based regimen allow personalization dose-intensity show inclusion etoposide infusional administration decrease tumor cell resistance . - The use DA-EPOCH combination rituximab treatment HIVassociated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma show safe effective . - Given central role control HIV viremia combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) management KSHV-associated malignancy , well likely contribution uncontrolled HIV viremia PEL pathogenesis , cART employ important part treatment regimen . Objectives : Phase I : -Determine maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase II dose pomalidomide combination DA-EPOCH-R . Phase II -Evaluate overall survival treatment-naive patient primary effusion lymphoma treat pomalidomide combination , DA-EPOCH rituximab ( DAEPOCH- RP ) . Eligibility : -Adult patient great equal 18 year pathology confirm primary effusion lymphoma , include extracavitary variant OR large cell lymphoma arise set KSHVassociated MCD . - Lymphoma measurable assessable - Previously treat patient allow treated modify DA-EPOCH pomalidomide KSHV-associated lymphoma - Any HIV status - Hematologic biochemical parameter within pre-specified limit baseline - Willing use effective birth control , define full protocol - Neither pregnant breast feed - Excluded serious co-morbid condition would prohibit administration plan chemotherapeutic intervention present Design : - This phase I/ II study pomalidomide combination modify DA-EPOCH-R patient PEL diffuse large cell lymphoma arise set KSHVMCD . - Phase I study evaluate escalating dos pomalidomide ( 3 mg , 4 mg , 5 mg ) combination modify DA-EPOCH-R determine safe tolerable phase II pomalidomide dose combination . - Treatment Phase I Phase II three part . Patients receive 21 day pomalidomide monotherapy ( part A ) , follow 6 cycle pomalidomide combination modify DA-EPOCH-R ( part B ) , optional 12 month pomalidomide ( part C ) patient concurrent KS , symptomatic KSHVMCD , KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome ( KICS ) . - Patients HIV generally prescribe cART . - In phase I , 3 dose level , 9-18 patient accrue ( 3-6 patient per level ) . - In phase II portion study , 15 evaluable patient enrol 48-60 month 12 month follow-up last patient enrol , 1-tailed 0.10 alpha level test would 80 % power determine OS curve would demonstrate 1-year OS consistent 45 % good rule 20 % bad .</detailed_description>
