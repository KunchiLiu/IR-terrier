	<brief_summary>Background : Asthma common chronic disease childhood prevalence 1.6 time great African American ( AA ) child Non-Hispanic White children.1 Nationally , 700,000 child see asthma Emergency Departments ( ED ) every year , 1 % see Children 's National Health System ( CN ) Washington , DC . School performance school attendance well studied urban child asthma , especially middle school level . Objective : Our purpose test hypothesis middle school child asthma bad school performance middle school child without asthma Washington DC Prince George 's county school . Methods : The investigator conduct cross-sectional observational study middle-school ( grades 6-8 2013-2014 school year ) age child without asthma recruit Emergency Departments IMPACT DC asthma clinic CN . The investigator collect demographic information , asthma severity information ( case ) , request parent mail report card standardize test score directly investigator . The investigator use multivariable linear logistic regression determine presence asthma associate school performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Academic Achievement Children Asthma Research Plan A . Background Specific Aims Asthma common chronic disease childhood prevalence 1.6 time great African American ( AA ) child Non-Hispanic White children.1 Nationally , 700,000 child see asthma Emergency Departments ( ED ) every year , 1 % see Children 's National Medical Center ( CN ) Washington , DC . The asthma prevalence rate among African America ( AA ) child teens Washington , DC 20 % high national rate2 overall ED utilization rate asthma 4.3 time national rate.3 In 2007 , approximately 10.5 million school day lose due asthma.1 Asthma severity may impact academic performance due increase absenteeism . A study Canadian school child show child severe asthma low math reading scores.4 Tsakiris also show child asthma inhale corticosteroid well academic achievement child asthma long-term controller therapy , suggest poor control associate bad school performance.5 However , academic performance dependent many factor , socio-economic status local district resource available . Availability skilled nurse differs school , impact child asthma ; Hillemeier 's study child asthma Pennsylvania school show less half secondary school adequate school nurse coverage , reduce service provide child asthma.6 Children whose asthma manage school may absent often . Parental education also play part child 's school performance . Tsakiris et al , show Greece , low parental education level independently associate poor school performance child asthma.5 Early adolescence ( age 10-13 ) identify time great transition developmental biologic change ; time period male child asthma generally improve female asthma develop worsen asthma , likely due hormone effect . It show program reduce asthma symptom young child ( elementary school ) old child ( high school ) work well early adolescent child ( middle school ) .7 In addition , despite National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP , 2007 ) guideline encourage assessment quality life ( QOL ) child , minimal research QOL child asthma . Given scarcity information association pediatric asthma academic achievement , school attendance , QOL , need establish baseline within individual community , design study examine association asthma middle school ( grade 6 8 , inclusive ) child academic achievement , school attendance , QOL . Our overall hypothesis child asthma bad school performance compare child without asthma . Specific Aim 1 : To determine association asthma school performance compare grade point average ( GPA ) middle school age child without asthma . We enroll 200 child grade 6-8 asthma ( case ) ED/IMPACT DC compare group 200 child grades 6-8 without asthma ( control ) recruit ED . Report card collect August 2014 December 1 , 2014 200 case 200 control recruit , GPAs compare . We expect child asthma low GPAs . B . Significance : School achievement middle school student asthma well understood ; study pivotal identify middle school student asthma Washington DC perform poorly non-asthmatic counterpart . C. Preliminary study We previously study academic success child asthma . D. Research Design Methods We propose cross-sectional case-control observational study middle school ( grades 6-8 ) child compare academic achievement school attendance child without asthma . 200 child asthma ( case ) recruit IMPACT DC clinic and/or ED 200 child without asthma ( control ) recruit ED . Inclusion criterion case include asthma diagnose clinician great 1 year history exacerbation require systemic corticosteroid within past 2 year . Controls history asthma . All child , case control , must ( 1 ) grade level 6-8 2013-2014 school year , attend public school Washington , DC ( DCPS ) Prince George 's County Public Schools ( PGCPS ) , reside school district ; ( 2 ) accompany parent legal guardian . Exclusion criterion case control ( 1 ) presence chronic medical condition asthma ; ( 2 ) triage category 1 2 emergency department ; ( 3 ) family speak English Spanish Demographic Data Cases Controls Demographic information obtain structured interview ; questionnaire ( Appendix A ) use case control : parent/caregiver ask child 's age , gender , race/ethnicity , insurance type . health care utilization , medication usage , high level education parent/ caregiver , income household , parental report school service . Cases complete additional 11 question determine asthma severity determine NAEPP score Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) score ( Appendix F G ) . We utilize child 's electronic medical record ( Cerner ED chart eClinicalWorks IMPACT DC chart ) determine insurance type health care utilization . Reporting Academic Achievement School Attendance At time recruitment , family give self-addressed , stamp envelope send child 's 2013 first term ( available ) , standardized test score report ( available ) , final report card research team . All report cards/score report return family via US Mail $ 25 gift card incentive send report card . Academic achievement , standardized test score , school attendance record report card . All report card DCPS PGCPS system use grade scale.. Both system record attendance report card 180 school day year system . Reporting Quality Life use Peds QL 4.0 Form QOL measure use validate PedsQL 4.0 child , teen , parent ( Appendices B , C , D , E ) . The PedsQL 4.0 four scale 23 question ascertain physical functioning , emotional functioning , social functioning , school functioning . A 5-point Likert scale use child self-report parent proxy report . Items reverse score linearly transform 0 100 scale ( 0=100 , 1=75 , 2=50 , 3=25 , 4=0 ) , high score indicate good QOL . E. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistic use analyze demographic variable ( rate , proportion , mean , median , range ) . Univariate comparison perform use appropriate categorical continuous statistical analysis . Multivariate test perform use logistic and/or liner regression appropriate . Sample Size : The study power proportion patient group grade point average &gt; 3.0 . The overall proportion DC public middle school student 2012-2013 school year GPA &gt; 3.0 approximately 35 % . Assuming figure similar child without asthma ( control ) , need 70 case 70 control 80 % power detect 20 % absolute difference proportion child asthma ( case ) grade point average &gt; 3.0 ( alpha = 0.05 , two-sided ) . We choose include 200 child group , expect less 50 % include patient return final year report card via self-addressed , stamp envelope .</detailed_description>
