	<brief_summary>Awake craniotomy ( AC ) anesthetic surgical technique commonly use resect tumor involve adjacent eloquent motor cortex , portion brain responsible language motor skill , respectively . By map area brain necessary function , neurosurgeon able avoid resection cortical tissue might compromise patient 's ability speak move , hence preserve neurologic function . AC often accomplish direct cortical stimulation inhibition , maintain patient 's ability interact operative team . The anesthetic technique often involve regional ( scalp ) block combine intraoperative intravenous mild sedation . In reported instance AC , cortical mapping perform , technique perform solely think AC lead good recovery profile ( less pain , good neurologic outcome , short hospital stay ) craniotomy perform general anesthesia . The Quality Recovery Score ( QoR-40 ) validate , multi-parameter instrument use various postoperative population ass overall satisfaction well-being patient undergone anesthesia surgery . Leslie et al . report QoR-40 valid tool assess neurosurgical patient , direct comparison AC patient general anesthesia craniotomy ( GAC ) patient use tool never perform . AC may also associate good 30 90 day multi-parameter outcome GAC . The well-validated Acute Short Form ( SF-12 ) health survey , abbreviated version SF-36 , consist 12 item . It measure two domain , include mental physical component summary ( mental component summary physical composite score , respectively ) . Hypothesis : Awake craniotomy tumor resection associate well multi-parameter quality recovery immediate postoperative period , good 30 90 day quality life outcome , craniotomy perform general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
