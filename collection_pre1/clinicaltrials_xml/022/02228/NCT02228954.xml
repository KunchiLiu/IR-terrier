	<brief_summary>Rationale . In part patient good intermediate risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) disease course indolent immediate start systemic therapy necessary . By , investigator able identify patient indolent disease minor group patient rapidly progressive disease . In patient indolent disease , watchful wait period prefer , since quality life unnecessary hamper adverse event therapy resistance induce . This study aim identify patient watchful wait period possible molecular imaging . Furthermore several type systemic therapy possible progression proven . These systemic treatment comparable term efficacy , term toxicity impact quality life . As secondary objective , usefulness decision aid guiding choice patient study . Objectives . To assess patient good intermediate prognosis mRCC eligible watchful waiting , add value beyond clinical work-up : 1 . FDG-PET 89Zr-girentuximab-PET result measure presentation predict rapid progression ( ≤ 2 month baseline scan ) watchful wait . 2 . FDG-PET 89Zr-girentuximab-PET result measure presentation predict prolong indolent ( ≥12 month baseline scan ) disease watchful wait . To assess value therapy choice decision aid patient progressive disease . Study design . This multicenter non-blinded prospective observational study 80 good intermediate prognosis mRCC patient . Study population . Patients good intermediate prognosis mRCC accord Heng criterion , ≥18 year , without contra-indications watchful wait period , able provide inform consent . Intervention . At baseline FDG-PET-CT 89Zr-girentuximab-PET make . During watchful wait period , disease evaluation CT accord RECIST criterion make frequently , establish progressive disease . At moment , second FDG-PET-CT , case positive 89Zr-girentuximab-PET-scan baseline , second 89Zr-girentuximab-PET perform decision aid use help patient choose best treatment four option ; pazopanib , sunitinib , combine interferon-α bevacizumab ( case positive 89Zr-girentuximab-PET ) radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) 177lutetium labelled girentuximab . Participation RIT trial part separate phase II study . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness . At baseline , 18F-FDG-PET-CT 89Zr-Girentuximab-PET performed . During watchful wait period CT 's make . During therapy , follow-up include standard laboratory analysis , CT-scans regular visit outpatient clinic . Side effect medication adverse event consequence tumor biopsy may occur . The radiation exposure PET investigation acceptable require shield injection 89Zr-labelled girentuximab . Patients may benefit disease regression stabilization . All three treatment choice proven clinical benefit patient population . The risk participation RIT trial describe phase II trial protocol , already judge Medical Ethics Review Committee .</brief_summary>
