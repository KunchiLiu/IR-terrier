	<brief_summary>This 3-year proposal family-based cohort study establish representative sample probands ASD parent well-characterized environmental , clinical phenotype , endophenotypes , genetic data conduct CNV experiment genotype-phenotype correlation . Based previous finding , probands CNVs large 500kb identified family newly recruit present project reveal origin CNVs reveal clinical feature family . The significant finding specific gene conduct pathway analysis reveal etiology ASD , provide understanding disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Due high prevalence , long-term impairment , high genetic component ( heritability &gt; 90 % ) , lack effective prevention treatment , ASD prioritize genetic study . However , despite extensive genetic research , conclusive result mainly due clinical genetic heterogeneity ASD . Given progress CNV study ASD , several challenge remain faced , difference phenotypic definition across different study ; lack population norm CNVs , lack consensus method CNV detection analysis . In present study , large segment CNV find ASD probands compare standardized control National Center Genome Medicine ( NCGM ) , Academia Sinica identify possible CNVs . The important issue CNV research ASD investigate whether origin CNVs inherit de novo . By collect complete background reveal CNVs parent sibling , origin CNVs uncovered present project . The candidate gene important CNVs identify pathway analysis . Gene expression conduct confirm pathogenic gene . Notably present study help bridge gap translate bench finding bedside help early detection ASD pave way develop effective treatment ASD future . Specific Aims : With above-mentioned rationale project limit research budget NSC , ultimate goal project identify important CNVs reveal pathogenic gene ASD future translational research ASD prospectively characterize clinical feature ASD individual CNV . The specific aim study follow , 1 . To identify important pathogenic CNVs compare CNVs CNPs control provide NCGM , Academia Sinica ; 2 . To assess parent sibling ASD patient find ~500 kb CNVs previous study use clinical , psychopathological , social measure family study also conduct CNV analysis family determine origin CNVs ; 3 . To conduct follow-up assessment clinical feature , social neuropsychological function ASD probands CNV examine phenotype change time ; 4 . To study clinical phenotype de novo inherited group reveal pathogenic CNVs ; 5 . To conduct pathway analysis gene involve CNVs , confirm pathogenic gene conduct gene expression analysis ; 6 . To investigate association clinical phenotype autistic tendency , social impairment ( 1 ) probands with/without CNVs/controls , ( 2 ) probands/unaffected siblings/controls .</detailed_description>
