	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare clinical outcome two commonly use , FDA-approved biologic mesh hernia repair abdominal wall reconstruction ( Strattice XenMatrix ) . The two mesh derive pig skin cell remove sterilize . The two mesh make two different company use different process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Comparing Performance Profiles Two Non-Cross-Linked Porcine Dermal Matrices Abdominal Wall Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized-controlled trial compare two porcine acellular matrix abdominal wall reconstruction . It single-blind ( patient blind type mesh use surgeon ) . Our goal study : 1 . PRIMARY OUTCOME : To compare overall complication rate two non-cross-linked porcine dermal matrix ( XenMatrix Strattice ) 30 day 1 year postoperatively 2 . SECONDARY OUTCOMES . To compare rate Surgical Site Occurrences ( SSOs ) XenMatrix Strattice abdominal wall reconstruction 30 day 1 year postoperatively 1 . Infection 2 . Seroma 3 . Hematoma 4 . Wound dehiscence 5 . Skin necrosis 6 . Formation enterocutaneous fistula 7 . Mesh infection ii . To compare hernia recurrence rate XenMatrix Strattice 30 day 1 year postoperatively iii . To compare bulge rate XenMatrix Strattice 30 day 1 year postoperatively iv . To compare change patient pain , physical functioning quality life hernia repair XenMatrix Strattice , preoperatively , 1 year postoperatively A . Pain assessment : Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Pain Intensity survey , PROMIS Pain Interference survey B . Physical function assessment : PROMIS Physical Function C. Quality life assessment : Hernia-Related Quality-of-Life ( HerQLes ) survey</detailed_description>
