	<brief_summary>This study pilot study design compare safety cardiovascular effect 26 week combination hydralazine/isorsorbide dinitrate therapy amlodipine therapy patient receive chronic hemodialysis . The investigator hypothesize treatment chronic hemodialysis ( ESRD ) patient combination hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate compare amlopdipine safe improve heart function well blood flow/blood vessel supply .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixteen patient receive maintenance hemodialysis randomize 26 week therapy combination hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate amlodipine . Study medication titrate goal dose first 4 week maintain goal dose ( tolerate ) week 4-26 . A final study visit ass symptom drug discontinuation occur 4 week drug discontinuation . Study duration-Maximum 32 week 26 week active therapy . Efficacy Measures -Tissue Doppler echocardiography myocardial perfusion scan use radioactive NH3 PET assess week 0 26 . Safety Measures-Adverse event rate include inter- intra-dialytic hypotension , hyperkalemia , cardiovascular death gastrointestinal symptom assess throughout duration study .</detailed_description>
