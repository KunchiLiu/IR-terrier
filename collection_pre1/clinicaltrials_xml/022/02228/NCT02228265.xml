	<brief_title>Molecular Features Pathways Predicting Drug Resistance Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Enzalutamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response ( &lt; / &gt; = 50 % decline ) 12 week versus ( vs. ) baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways progression-free survival ( defined time day 1 study drug treatment date radiographic progression clinical progression ) , disease-specific survival ( defined time day 1 study drug date death prostate cancer ) , overall survival ( defined time day 1 study drug treatment date death cause ) . II . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways time PSA progression . III . To identify molecular feature cellular pathway present tumor men metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) progress despite enzalutamide treatment . IV . To explore correlation baseline molecular feature pathways objective response . V. To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways degree PSA decline 12 week maximal PSA decline observe study . VI . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature time treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( cfDNA ) molecular feature blood molecular feature pathways biopsy sample . II . To assess correlation cfDNA molecular feature endpoint primary secondary objective list . III . To explore correlation baseline molecular feature tissue histology . IV . To explore correlation baseline tissue histology PSA change , time PSA progression , time treatment , progression-free survival , overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood tissue sample baseline , administration enzalutamide , time disease progression analysis via immunohistochemistry , comparative genome hybridization , sequence . After completion study , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
