	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm advanced ( FIGO Stage III IV ) , persistent , recurrent endometrial carcinoma , likely curable surgery radiotherapy . Histologic documentation recurrence require . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define RECIST version 1.1 ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must great equal 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; great equal 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must great equal 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI ( See section 8 ) . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST 1.1 ( Section 8.1 ) . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Prior chemoradiotherapy pelvic recurrence permit . Prior chemotherapy adjuvant set Stage I , II III disease permit . Note : No prior chemotherapy set Stage IV disease permit unless patient without evidence disease completion chemotherapy least six month progressionfree survival since completion chemotherapy . Regardless circumstance , one prior chemotherapy regimen ( include chemoradiotherapy ) permit . Patient must able take p.o . medication . Performance status must 01 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : NOTE : Institutional/laboratory upper limit normal = ULN Institutional/laboratory low limit normal = LLN Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mcl Platelets great equal 100,000 cells/mcl Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Coagulation • INR less equal 1.5 x ULN ( range INR , usually 2 3 , patient stable dose therapeutic warfarin ) . Renal function : • Creatinine le equal 1.5 x ULN Hepatic function : Bilirubin le equal 1.5 x ULN ALT AST less equal 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5 x ULN Albumin great equal 2.8 g/dL Lipid panel : Fasting serum cholesterol less equal 300 mg/dL Fasting triglycerides less equal 300 mg/ At least 4 week must elapse since patient underwent major surgery ( e.g. , major : hysterectomy , resection lung nodule ; minor : central venous access catheter placement ) . At least 4 week must elapse since patient receive radiation therapy . Patients meet preentry requirement specify Section 7.0 Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . All patient must least 18 year age Patients childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior study entry practice highly effective form contraception . During study treatment 8 week stop treatment . Highly effective contraception method include combination two following : Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository ; Total abstinence ; Male/female sterilization . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior randomization . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider childbearing potential . Patients previously receive everolimus , another mTOR inhibitor agent target PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway . Known intolerance hypersensitivity Everolimus rapamycin analog ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus ) Patients previously receive hormonal therapy endometrial cancer . Patients concomitant invasive malignancy history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , exclude evidence malignancy present within past five year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol . Patients receive chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent . Patients active uncontrolled systemic infection . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary . Known severely impaired lung function , include : • CTCAE grade 2 ( great ) hypoxia ( decrease oxygen saturation exercise [ e.g. , pulse oximeter &lt; 88 % ] ; intermittent supplemental oxygen ) Patients known history cardiac disease . This include : Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic great 150 mm Hg diastolic great 90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication . Myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior registration . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure . History serious ventricular arrhythmia ( i.e. , ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation ) serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . This include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation control ventricular rate . Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 6 month prior first date study therapy . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . Patients known central nervous system metastasis . Patients know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Patients impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption everolimus ( e.g. , ulcerative disease ; uncontrolled nausea , vomit and/or diarrhea ; malabsorption syndrome ; clinical sign symptoms gastrointestinal obstruction ; and/or patient require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition ) . Patients plan receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start everolimus study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Patients active bleed pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding , know bleed disorder coagulopathy . Patients currently part participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 30 day prior dose . Patients must able follow concomitant medication restriction : Avoid use strong CYP3A/PgP inhibitor ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , nefazodone , saquinavir , telithromycin , ritonavir , indinavir , nelfinavir , voriconazole ) . Use caution coadministered moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor ( e.g. , amprenavir , fosamprenavir , aprepitant , erythromycin , fluconazole , verapamil , diltiazem ) . Grapefruit , grapefruit juice , food know inhibit cytochrome P450 PgP activity may increase everolimus exposure avoid treatment . Avoid use concomitant strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer ( e.g. , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenobarbital ) . St. John 's Wort may decrease everolimus exposure unpredictably avoid . Patients active hepatitis B C. Screening hepatitis B Prior randomization/start everolimus , follow three category patient test hepatitis B viral load serologic marker , , HBsAg , HBcAb , HBsAb quantitative hepatitis B DNA PCR ( HBVDNA ) : • All patient currently live ( live ) Asia , Africa , Central South America , Eastern Europe , Spain , Portugal Greece . [ http : //wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter3infectiousdiseasesrelatedtotravel/hepatitisb.htm ] Patients follow risk factor : know suspect past hepatitis B infection , blood transfusion ( ) prior 1990 , current prior IV drug user , current prior dialysis , household contact hepatitis B infect patient ( ) , current prior highrisk sexual activity , body pierce tattoo , mother know hepatitis B history suggestive hepatitis B infection , e.g. , dark urine , jaundice , right upper quadrant pain . Additional patient discretion investigator The management guideline , Section 6 , provide accord result baseline assessment viral load serological marker hepatitis B . Screening hepatitis C Patients follow risk factor hepatitis C test use quantitative RNAPCR : know suspect past hepatitis C infection ( include patient past interferon 'curative ' treatment ) , blood transfusion prior 1990 , current prior IV drug user , current prior dialysis , household contact hepatitis C infect patient ( ) , current prior highrisk sexual activity , body pierce tattoo . At discretion investigator , additional patient may also test hepatitis C. The management guideline , Section 6 provide accord result baseline assessment hepatitis C viral load .</criteria>
