	<brief_summary>The purpose study use corneal topographer , device readily available optometric practice , order determine position multifocal ( MF ) contact lens ( CL ) optic relation optic eye . The specific purpose study evaluate relationship position optic study lenses objective subjective visual performance well participant satisfaction . The MF CL lenses fit two group participant ( previously unsuccessful vs. currently successful MF CL wearer ) . HYPOTHESES - The measurement power distribution acquire Medmont E300 corneal topographer effective determine MF CL lens centration predictor MF CL success . - There difference MF CL centration , determine corneal topography , successful unsuccessful MF CL wearer . - MF CL centration , determine corneal topography , correlate visual performance , determine ocular aberrometry , measure visual acuity subjective satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A person eligible inclusion study he/she : 1 . Is least 42 year age full legal capacity volunteer ; 2 . Has read sign information consent letter ; 3 . Is willing able follow instruction maintain appointment schedule ; 4 . Has previous experience wear MF CLs ; 5 . Is able successfully fit study lenses ; 6 . Has vertexcorrected spherical distance prescription +6.00 8.00D ( inclusive ) eye ; 7 . Has spectacle cylinder ≤0.75D eye ; 8 . Requires read addition ≥+1.00D ; A person exclude study he/she : 1 . Is participate concurrent clinical research study ; 2 . Has know active* ocular disease and/or infection ; 3 . Has systemic condition opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable ; 4 . Is use systemic topical medication opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable ; 5 . Has know sensitivity diagnostic pharmaceutical use study ; 6 . Is pregnant , lactate plan pregnancy time enrolment ; 7 . Is aphakic ; 8 . Has undergone refractive error surgery ; 9 . Has monocular bestcorrected VA bad 20/30 eye ; 10 . Has amblyopia strabismus ; 11 . Has anisometropia &gt; 2D eye For purpose study , active ocular disease define infection inflammation require therapeutic treatment . Mild ( i.e . consider clinically relevant ) lid abnormality ( blepharitis , meibomian gland dysfunction , papilla ) , corneal conjunctival stain dry eye consider active ocular disease . Neovascularization corneal scar result previous hypoxia , infection inflammation therefore active .</criteria>
