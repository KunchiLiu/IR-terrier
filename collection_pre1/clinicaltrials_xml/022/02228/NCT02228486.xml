	<brief_summary>Relapse major risk substance abuse disorder , closely related crave substance , describe strong urge consumption . Cue-exposure therapy intervention aim reduction perceive crave repeat confrontation . It base assumption crave drop repeat exposure without reinforce experience elicit consumption . In present study , patient alcohol dependency take part nine cue-exposure training session . Each session consist mood induction reflect high risk situation subsequent vivo confrontation one 's prefer alcoholic beverage follow train cop strategy . During cue-exposure , patient focus perceive automatic response alcohol-related cue . We hypothesize especially patient exhibit initially high reaction cue profit intervention . The reaction measure subjective ( crave ) physiological level ( hemodynamics prefrontal cortex , heart rate variability , electrodermal activity ) . Furthermore , want strengthen expect training effect cue-exposure activate transcranial direct current stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , show hypoactive substance abuse disorder . We investigate cue-exposure training affect process alcoholic cue ( cue-reactivity ) relation clinical symptom alcohol dependency .</brief_summary>
