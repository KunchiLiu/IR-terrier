	<brief_summary>Injury blood vessel extremity , specifically artery , result fracture severe crush injury . It occur 3 % general population . People affect blood vessel injury important problem , include cold intolerance , general pain , weaken function associate limb . Even surgical intervention repair affect artery , people may still experience numbness , problem movement , inadequate supply oxygen limb . These symptom particularly relevant case forearm arterial repair repair directly affect one vital structure : hand . Despite available intervention advance microsurgical technique , arterial repair still result significant sensory functional impairment hand . Once artery within arm injure , surgeon 's primary goal restore blood flow hand prevent functional impairment . Even prompt effort restore hand perfusion , long-term ( great 6 month ) sensory motor function hard predict . Furthermore , sometimes repaired artery becomes occlude time . We believe occlusion direct impact patient 's perceived pain cold intolerance level hand . In study , investigate occurrence blood vessel occlusion arm least 6 month surgery impact event . To assess use physical exam , non-invasive test , duplex doppler ultrasound questionnaire . Questionnaires , include DASH ( disability arm , shoulder , hand ) , CISS ( Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity Questionnaire ) , Michigan hand score , use ass pain , sensory , motor impairment affect unaffected hand . Functional assessment include 2-point discrimination , grip strength , pinch strength , capillary refill range motion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vascular injury extremities result fracture , severe crush injury , laceration , even iatrogenic cause , surgical intervention . Its prevalence 3 % general population increase incidence time war . Patients affect vascular injury significant morbidity , include cold intolerance , pain , sensory abnormality , weakness affect limb . Even repair affect artery , patient may still experience paresthesia , motor function abnormality pain cold intolerance . These symptom particularly relevant case arm arterial repair repair directly affect function hand . Different techniques arterial repair evolve time . Venous graft ( i.e . saphenous dorsal hand vein ) employ repair damage vessel . Although appropriate treat long gap , vein graft several disadvantage . There often diameter mismatch harvest vein damage artery compromise repair site . Furthermore , vein compliant high volume storage capability arterial counterpart . These inherent venous quality alter blood flow limb cause stasis , turbulence , eventually , stenosis graft . Other methodology develop effort balance negative associate venous grafting , include synthetic graft use , arterial ligation , end-to-side anastomosis , end-to-end repair . Despite available intervention advance microsurgical technique , arterial repair arm , still result significant functional impairment upper extremity . The hand highly perfuse dual arterial system arch across dorsal palmar surface hand . Once upper extremity artery compromise , surgeon 's primary goal restore blood flow hand prevent impairment . Despite surgeon 's best effort , long term ( great 6 month ) outcomes hard predict . Furthermore , patency rate arterial repair consistently report approximately 50 % . We believe long term patency upper extremity artery direct effect patient 's perceived pain cold intolerance , sensibility , motor function hand . Our hypothesis repair artery upper extremity occlusion rate 50 % long term ( great 6 month post-surgery ) occlusion responsible motor sensory function abnormality , pain , cold-intolerance . We use high resolution duplex Doppler ultrasound investigate occlusion rate repair artery compare unaffected contralateral artery ( internal control ) . Questionnaires , include DASH ( disability arm , shoulder , hand ) , CISS ( Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity Questionnaire ) , Michigan hand score , use ass pain , cold intolerance , sensory , motor impairment affect unaffected hand . Functional assessment include 2-point discrimination , grip strength , pinch strength , capillary refill range motion .</detailed_description>
