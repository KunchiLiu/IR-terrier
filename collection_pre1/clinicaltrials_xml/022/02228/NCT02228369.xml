	<criteria>1 . Obtained write informed consent 2 . Male female age least 18 year . Aged least 20 Japanese . 3 . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis NSCLC single activate EGFR mutation ( L858R Exon19Del ) . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to1 . For LM patient , 0 2 acceptable . 5 . In Part A , prior treatment least one line single agent EGFR TKI least 1 line chemotherapy . 6 . In Part BBM expansion , patient must receive EGFR TKI asymptomatic brain metastasis , either find screen process require local treatment opinion investigator local treatment give ( surgery radiation ) , patient must stable without corticosteroid and/or anticonvulsant treatment least 2 week study enrollment . For Part BLM expansion , patient receive previous EGFR TKI treatment must stable extracranial disease ; EGFR TKI treatment na√Øve patient also enrol AZD9291 cohort , AZD3759 cohorts efficacy signal see Part A agree Safety Review Committee . 7 . For patient neither LM measurable BM : At least one measurable extracranial lesion . For patient measurable BM without LM : least one measurable intracranial lesion 8 . For patient LM : Confirmed diagnosis LM positive CSF cytology . 9 . Male patient willing use barrier contraception , i.e. , condom , 3 month last study drug take . 10 . Females agree use adequate contraceptive measure , breast feeding must negative pregnancy test prior start dose childbearing potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential 11 . In Part BAZD9291 LM expansion ( subcohort T790M+ LM patient ) , patient must central confirmation T790M+ mutation status sample take documented progression last treatment administer prior enrol study . Patients must receive prior therapy EGFR TKI may also receive additional line treatment . Stable extracranial disease require . 1 . For patient LM and/or BM , CNS complication require urgent neurosurgical intervention 2 . For patient LM , inability undergo collection CSF 3 . Treatment EGFR TKI ( e.g. , erlotinib gefitinib ) within 8 day approximately 5 x halflife , whichever longer , first dose study treatment . 4 . Any cytotoxic chemotherapy , anticancer drug treatment advance NSCLC previous treatment regimen within 14 day first dose study treatment 5 . Radiotherapy wide field radiation within 4 week radiotherapy limited field radiation palliation within 1 week first dose study treatment exception patient receive radiation 30 % bone marrow must complete within 4 week first dose study treatment . 6 . Patients currently receive ( unable stop use least 1 week prior receive first dose AZD3759/AZD9291 ) medication herbal supplement know potent inhibitor inducer cytochrome P450 3A4/5 potential inhibitor cytochrome P450 2C8 ( patient enrol AZD9291 cohort ) . 7 . Past medical history interstitial lung disease , druginduced interstitial lung disease , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease . 8 . Known intracranial haemorrhage unrelated tumour 9 . Refractory nausea vomit control supportive therapy , chronic gastrointestinal disease , inability swallow formulate product previous significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption AZD3759/AZD9291 10 . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension active bleeding diatheses 11 . Inadequate bone marrow reserve organ function 12 .
