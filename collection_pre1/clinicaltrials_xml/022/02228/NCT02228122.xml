	<brief_title>The Effect Aquacel® Ag+ Extra Dressing Wound Biofilms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic wound wound infection costly , result prolonged hospital stay increase risk secondary infection septicaemia . In UK management chronic venous leg ulcer estimate cost £1 billion/year , surgical site infection require approximately 6.5 day additional hospital stay . Chronic wound typically harbour wide variety bacteria ; heavy bacterial colonisation subsequent biofilm formation cite factor induces chronic inflammatory state delay heal time . AQUACEL®Ag+ Extra soft conformable flat sheet nonwoven fabric dressing , form gel become wet . Its physical characteristic potential increase speed antimicrobial action silver effectiveness recalcitrant wind bioburden . Removing potential barrier heal may help towards wound progression . Aim : This pilot study investigate effect Aquacel Ag+ Extra dress chronic wound bacterial biofilms . Wound debridement tissue assess presence/absence situ biofilms monitor 4 week compare baseline ( non-treatment ) sample . Additionally , evaluate reduction wind volume treatment period .</detailed_description>
