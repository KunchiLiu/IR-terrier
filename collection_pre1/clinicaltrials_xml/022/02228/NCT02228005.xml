	<brief_title>The Effect Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Gait , Balance , Bone Metabolism Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) class antidepressant medication frequently use treat depressive anxiety disorder elderly . Although widely consider safe option , several observational study find SSRIs strong association fall psychotropic medication include tricyclic antidepressant benzodiazepine . However , potential mechanism link SSRIs fall unclear . Compared psychotropic medication , SSRIs low rate side effect could contribute fall , include sedation , orthostatic blood pressure change , anticholinergicity . Interestingly , SSRIs also associate fracture , class antidepressant , administrative database study prospective cohort study control fall history . Serotonin known play role regulate bone mass study find loss bone mass individual SSRI treatment . The association SSRIs fall fracture confound depression associate fall , gait instability , bone loss fracture . The goal study disentangle contribution disease versus treatment risk fall fracture . As first step towards goal , pilot study : ) estimate effect size statistical power calculation adequately power study ; ii ) examine feasibility timely recruitment old patient major depression take antidepressant medication minimum 2 week prior enter study . To address research question , design prospective observational pilot study . Older adult depression assess baseline , 3,6 , 12 week initiation sertraline antidepressant therapy . A non-depressed comparison group use control learn effect repeat assessment . The outcomes interest change gait , static balance , dynamic balance recovery reaction . Our primary outcome short-term change variable 3 week , also perform longitudinal analysis ass change 12 week .</detailed_description>
