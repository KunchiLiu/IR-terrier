	<brief_title>Focal Prostate Radiofrequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim assess ability focal therapy use coil bipolar radiofrequency device ablate pre-defined target tissue zone well assess side-effects . The medical device coil configuration create thus `` Faraday cage '' effect , prevent surround tissue damage bipolar configuration produce complete tissue thermo coagulation within limit coil . Thereof propose conduct prospective development study , offer focal therapy coil bipolar radiofrequency ablation men histologically proven localized prostate cancer clinically significant . Localization characterization disease establish use multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mp-MRI ) transperineal prostate biopsy . Magnetic resonance ( MR ) -visible , clinically significant disease target focally treated margin normal tissue big anatomically possible obtain adequate margin normal tissue around lesion effective ablation . Secondary lesion meet criterion clinical insignificance leave untreated undergo surveillance . Pre-operative post operative imaging perform use scanner pelvic phase array receiver , pelvic coil . A full protocol T1 T2 weight turbo-spin echo image dynamic post gadolinium volume acquisition use pre-operative diagnostic planning scan post-operative assessment use medical device . The initial transperineal biopsy already perform , prior invitation participate study , demonstrate eligibility inclusion . The process involve target map biopsy concordant lesion see MRI . In case , transperineal biopsy take prostate use brachytherapy grid place perineal skin whilst man lithotomy position . They give much time need consider whether patient wish participate . The one wish participate read patient information sheet undergo screen visit ( first visit ) ascertain whether eligible trial . If , proceed focal radiofrequency ablation use coil bipolar device ( second visit ) , see follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
