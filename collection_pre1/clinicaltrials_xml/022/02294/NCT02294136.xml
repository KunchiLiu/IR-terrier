	<brief_summary>End-stage liver disease , predominantly due hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , one lead cause death person live HIV infection . While HCV curable recent advance treatment increase rate cure , patient HIV HCV treat cure HCV . Based formative research , investigator develop `` Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation Preparation hepatitis C treatment ( PREP-C ) '' . PREP-C clinical interview healthcare provider diverse discipline train administer . It provide assessment client 's psychosocial readiness begin HCV treatment identifies domains function require intervention improve treatment readiness . PREP-C ( www.prepC.org ) also telemedicine resource health care provider . Under protocol , exist PREP-C clinical interview ( assessment ) incorporate behavioral intervention . This study test integrate assessment-behavioral intervention increase HCV treatment initiation among HIV-co-infected patient . The assessment-behavioral intervention protocol conduct two phase , Intervention Development phase Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) phase . Findings vanguard study inform design parameter large , rigorous evaluation R01 application , result promise . The PREP-C web-based assessment intervention package design scalable disseminate live PrepC.org web site . The propose study innovative seek develop first web-based intervention health care provider use increase HCV treatment initiation HIV/HCV-co-infected person . The study major public health impact provide need structured resource health care provider increase rate HCV treatment initiation HIV/HCV-co-infected person , thereby reduce mortality due end-stage liver disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In response PAR-12-279 `` Pilot Intervention Services Research Grants ( R34 ) , '' application propose develop test feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy nurse-delivered intervention address patient-level barrier ( Information , Motivation , Behavioral Skills ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) treatment uptake adherence HIV-co-infected patient . End-stage liver disease lead cause mortality HIV-infected person result high rate untreated chronic HCV-co-infection . HCV infection cure effectiveness HCV treatment dramatically increase FDA approval two HCV protease inhibitor May 2011 . The uptake HCV treatment HIV/HCV-co-infected patient remain , however , unacceptably low ( estimate 10 % ) despite fact test standard care HIV-infected person 10 year . Progress develop effective behavioral intervention successfully engage retain HIV-co-infected patient already engage HIV care HCV care keep pace significant pharmacologic advance HCV treatment . There multiple barrier HCV treatment initiation patient , provider , structural level . As HCV treatment becomes effective clinic overcome structural provider barrier , increase need structure mean assess patient-level barrier provide effective intervention order increase HCV treatment initiation , adherence , cure rate HIV/HCV-co-infected patient . Based formative prior NIH research ( K23MH71177 ) , investigator develop `` Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation Preparation hepatitis C treatment ( PREP-C ) '' . PREP-C web-based structured clinical interview healthcare provider diverse discipline train administer . It provide assessment client 's psychosocial readiness begin HCV treatment identifies domains function require tailor intervention improve treatment readiness . PREP-C date administer PI ( Weiss ) 97 patient telemedicine resource health care provider launch July 2012 ( PrepC.org ) . Specific aim : 1 . To formally adapt exist behavioral medicine intervention base PREP-C assessment target individual barrier ( Information , Motivation , Behavior Skills ) HCV treatment initiation HIV/HCV-co-infected patient medically eligible HCV treatment , pilot test refine tailor intervention 15 HIV/HCV-co-infected patient , finalize intervention manual . 2 . To conduct pilot randomize clinical trial 60 HIV/HCV-co-infected patient medically eligible HCV treatment , compare nurse-delivered PREP-C intervention ( n=30 ) attention control ( n=30 ) order evaluate patient acceptance , patient satisfaction , enrollment retention , well preliminary efficacy ( initiation HCV treatment within 6 month randomization persistence adherence first 12 week treatment initiate treatment ) . Hypothesis : The PREP-C intervention increase Motivation , Information , Self-Efficacy lead high rate HCV treatment initiation , persistence adherence PREP-C intervention arm . The intervention study guide Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model health behavior adapt Motivational Interviewing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy technique ( e.g. , cognitive restructuring ) specific need patient population . In study , nurse train administer PREP-C integrate assessment-behavioral intervention . This four-session integrate assessment-intervention include administration already develop PREP-C assessment session one , tailor intervention target Motivation , Information Behavioral Skills sessions 2-4 developed study . The research take place major academic medical center HIV/HCV-co-infected patient actively treat HCV infection . Findings vanguard study inform design parameter large , rigorous evaluation R01 application , result promise . The PREP-C web-based assessment intervention package design scalable disseminate live PrepC.org web site . The propose study innovative seek develop first web-based intervention health care provider use increase HCV treatment initiation HIV/HCV-co-infected person . The study major public health impact provide need structured resource health care provider increase rate HCV treatment initiation HIV/HCV-co-infected person , thereby reduce mortality due end-stage liver disease .</detailed_description>
