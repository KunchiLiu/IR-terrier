	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND 1.1 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Despite improve cataract surgery instrumentation technique , incidence clinical CME remain 1 - 3 % follow uncomplicated PE/PCIOL . CME remain common cause suboptimal post-operative visual acuity ( VA ) uncomplicated PE/PCIOL . 1 % clinical CME incidence represent 30,000 new case annually USA . Clinical CME define clinically evident CME , VA typically 20/40 - 20/200 . Diagnostic test confirm CME FA leakage increase CRT OCT . If leave untreated , chronic photoreceptor degeneration irreversible VA loss occur , even macular edema eventually resolve . 1.2 TREATMENT OF PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Several treatment option CME investigate , include topical , oral , periocular intravitreal corticosteroid . Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2 , inhibit production arachidonic acid , precursor lipo-oxyenase ( LOX ) cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) pathway . Because corticosteroid inhibit LOX COX pathway , corticosteroid may expect effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) decrease inflammation . However , corticosteroid side effect , include potential increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) susceptible patient , require additional treatment secondary glaucoma . NSAIDs specifically inhibit COX-2 , therefore avoid potential complication corticosteroid . NSAIDs may good option CME treatment patient know corticosteroid responder . However , corneal stromal melt rare serious potential side-effect topical NSAIDs . 1.3 RANIBIZUMAB ( R ) AND PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Numerous study , ANCHOR , MARINA , PIER , show R effectively reduce perifoveal capillary leakage CMT , use treatment exudative age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . BRAVO CRUISE data show similar reduction perifoveal capillary leakage CMT use treatment retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) . To date , publish study report efficacy R monotherapy acute pseudophakic CME . This study ass R monotherapy , eliminate possible confound effect prior concurrent treatment either corticosteroid , NSAIDs , . Intravitreal R injection may avoid potential IOP elevation common topical , periocular intravitreal corticosteroid . R would also avoid corneal stromal melting , rare serious potential side-effect topical NSAIDs . 1.5 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RANIBIZUMAB R study 5000 subject neovascular AMD number Phase I , I/II , II , III , IIIb clinical trial . Serious adverse event related injection procedure occur &lt; 0.1 % intravitreal injection , include endophthalmitis , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RD ) , iatrogenic traumatic cataract . Other serious ocular adverse event observe among R-treated subject occur &lt; 2 % subject include intraocular inflammation increase IOP . The common adverse reaction ( report &gt; 6 % high R-treated subject control subject ) conjunctival hemorrhage , eye pain , vitreous floater , increase IOP , intraocular inflammation . Although low rate ( &lt; 4 % ) arterial thromboembolic event ( ATEs ) observe R clinical trial , potential risk ATEs follow intravitreal use vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor . 2 . OBJECTIVES To assess safety efficacy intravitreal ranibizumab ( R ) triamcinolone acetonide ( T ) treatment acute pseudophakic CME . The primary objective study assess SAFETY intravitreal R T acute pseudophakic CME treatment , evaluate : - Incidence severity ocular adverse event , identify eye examination - Incidence severity adverse event , identify physical examination , subject reporting , change vital sign The secondary objective study determine EFFICACY intravitreal R T acute pseudophakic CME treatment , evaluate : - Mean change spectral domain OCT CMT baseline ( micron ) - Mean change ETDRS letter baseline ( letter ) - Proportion patient 3 line well ETDRS letter improvement ( % ) - Time 3 line ETDRS letter improvement ( day ) - Mean number R T injection ( # ) - Mean IOP ( mm Hg ) 3 . STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This open-label , Phase I/II study evaluate intravitreal R vs. intravitreal T subject acute pseudophakic CME . Twenty patient acute CME uneventful PE/PCIOL randomize 1:1 treatment R T. R patient receive three monthly R injection , follow PRN dose . T patient receive PRN injection every 3 month . Re-treatment criterion include clinically evident worsen CME , combine follow : - Any increase spectral domain OCT CMT - Any observable fluid OCT - Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling FA . Patients follow monthly 12 month . 3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN To date , publish study report efficacy R monotherapy acute pseudophakic CME . The propose study would eliminate possible confound effect prior concurrent treatment steroid , NSAIDs , . Intravitreal R injection may avoid IOP elevation common topical , periocular intravitreal T injection . 3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 3.3.1 Primary Outcome Measures The primary objective study assess SAFETY intravitreal R T acute pseudophakic CME treatment , evaluate : - Incidence severity ocular adverse event , identify eye examination - Incidence severity adverse event , identify physical examination , subject reporting , change vital sign 3.3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures The secondary objective study determine EFFICACY intravitreal R T acute pseudophakic CME treatment , evaluate : - Mean change spectral domain OCT CMT baseline ( micron ) - Mean change ETDRS letter baseline ( letter ) - Proportion patient 3 line well ETDRS letter improvement ( % ) - Time 3 line ETDRS letter improvement ( day ) - Mean number R T injection ( # ) - Mean IOP ( mm Hg ) 3.4 SAFETY PLAN All subject query systemic adverse event ( AE ) . Potential ocular AE 's predicted common knowledge historical data R T include : ocular injection , pain , discharge , redness , visual change , floater , IOP elevation , allergic reaction , infection , inflammation , RD , choroidal detachment , vitreous hemorrhage , endophthalmitis .
