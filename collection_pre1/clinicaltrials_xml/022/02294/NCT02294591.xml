	<brief_title>NACOS - The Effect N-acetylcystein Depressive Symptoms Patients Suffering From Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar depression extremely invalidate depressive symptom result decrease social functioning reduces quality life . Bipolar depression associate three time long duration disorder period compare mania . This emphasize importance optimal treatment opportunity particular group . Psychological treatment often base effective maintenance therapy , limited evidence acute bipolar depression . The effect lithium acute phase depression low , use valproate still unclear bipolar depression . Lamotrigine antipsychotic , efficacy bipolar depression considerable tolerance issue . The effective treatment quetiapine quetiapine XR , treatment associate side effect sedation , weight gain dyslipidemia . Individuals suffer bipolar depression recognisable dysregulated oxidative mechanism . Evidence indicate GSH , central antioxidant brain vulnerable degradation . However , N-acetylcystine ( NAC ) improve L-cysteine supply lead increase GSH brain . A clinical randomized control study 75 patient , show significant decrease primary outcome measure ( MADRS-score ) compare control group . Furthermore , general health status function improve NAC group . This double-blinded randomized placebo control trial conduct , demonstrate efficacy NAC depressive symptom patient suffer bipolar depression , examine effect add-on treatment NAC level oxidative stress , quality life function . In total 87 participant include recruit The Mental Health Service Region Southern Denmark , ensure sufficient participant study . The trial run 24 week period participant . Participants study randomize either NAC standard treatment , placebo standard treatment 20 week , follow 4-week follow-up period . This trial first kind , analyse level oxidative stress blood urine sample among people suffer bipolar depression , examine add-on effect NAC treatment . The study receive academic scientific advice Ramus W. Licht , professor , ph.d , clinical advice Henrik E. Poulsen , professor , dr.med . This two international professor respectively bipolar disorder oxidative stress . Furthermore , international corporation support professor Michael Berk dr. Olivia Dean Deakin University , Australia , perform previously trial concern NAC treatment bipolar depression . The study medication low side effect low cost , advantage , desirable especially vulnerable group people . This trial may contribute optimal treatment opportunity people suffer bipolar depression , possibly psychiatric patient well .</detailed_description>
