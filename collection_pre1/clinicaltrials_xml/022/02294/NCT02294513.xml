	<brief_summary>There strong connection hearing loss cognitive impairment , particularly dementia , old age . Worldwide , dementia affect approximately 5 % person age 65 year . Hearing loss even prevalent old age , affect estimate one third person age 65 year . Thus , likely large degree overlap impairment . Indeed , overlap may influence old adult ' everyday functioning , communication , social engagement quality life , well influence well-being family caregiver . This project examine whether patient hear loss Alzheimer 's disease , common form dementia , derive benefit hearing aid prescribe fit follow current best practice procedure geriatric audiology clinic . For first time , formal evaluation potential benefit hear aid patient ' family caregiver also conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , five percent individual age 65 suffer Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) relate dementia . Given hearing loss affect approximately one third individual age 65 , likely many person AD also suffer co-morbid hearing loss . Following logic , small proportion patient treat geriatric audiology clinic likely AD hearing loss . Little research examine use hear aid person AD , whether current audiologic rehabilitation provide benefit cognitive , social , communication functioning . In addition , give caregiver burden huge issue caregiver person AD , study examine whether provide hear aid AD concomitant benefit family caregiver ( e.g. , spouse , adult child ) . The main research question study : Will person AD demonstrate benefit use hearing aid , benefit measure questionnaire assess activity daily live , communication , social functioning . We hypothesize participant AD intervention group ( i.e. , receive hear aid ) large improvement overall functioning end one-month three-month period participant AD two control group . Furthermore , hypothesize group cognitively normal control participant demonstrate similar gain function participant AD . Finally , hypothesize similar disparity benefit intervention control group see participant ' caregiver . The specific objective project determine , people AD … ) benefit hear aid base common audiologic outcome measure , well measure communication function activity daily live , benefit depend variation current audiologic practice ; b ) benefit hear aid regard measure severity cognitive , behavioural psychological symptom dementia relate caregiver burden ; c ) hear aid bolster family caregiver ' psychological well-being , relationship , perceive burden relate care communicate someone suffers AD hearing loss , specific issue relate communication audiologic rehabilitation identify important caregiver ; ) beneficial effect hear aid intervention person caregiver maintain three month post-fitting . A randomized control design use three group AD patient randomly assign 1 ) intervention ( immediate hearing aid fitting ) , 2 ) wait-list control ( hear aid intervention ) 3 ) active control ( hear aid intervention + use new form fitness technology ) . A final group control normal cognition also test . All participant undergo assessment cognition . They family caregiver complete battery measure least three occasion : right hear aid fitting complete provide baseline ( 1 ) , well one-month ( 2 ) three-months ( 3 ) post-fitting . Participants control group also complete set additional assessment correspond timeline hearing aid fitting participant intervention group ( i.e. , complete 5 assessment rather 3 ) . In addition study session , participant also complete standard audiology appointment include hear testing , hear aid evaluation , hear aid fitting , hear aid checking .</detailed_description>
