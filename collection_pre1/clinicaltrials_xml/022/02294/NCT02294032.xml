	<detailed_description>The purpose study understand role specific B cell activate repress anti-allograft immune response kidney transplantation . This study aim address two major challenge kidney transplantation : 1. guide physician immunosuppressive drug wean , 2. identify patient risk process develop antibody-mediated rejection . In study , blood collect kidney transplant patient different timepoints , prior transplant . Knowledge gain study finding use develop therapeutic strategy prevent antibody-mediated rejection , major cause long-term graft loss kidney transplant patient .</detailed_description>
