	<brief_summary>The investigator plan recruit patient prospective study patient need evaluation lung lesion suspicious cancer . Saliva sample collect diagnostic evaluation include biopsy subsequent blind examination salivary marker without knowledge disease status . This prospective recruitment retrospective blind evaluation PRoBE design satisfies high standard recommend National Cancer Institute biomarker development . This process limit selection bias confound retrospective study . As primary endpoint , pre-specified multi-marker panel evaluate base combination sensitivity specificity . In addition , seven pre-specified individual candidate mRNA cancer marker six internal reference `` housekeeping '' gene evaluate . The performance new multi-marker panel also assess compare prior pre-specified model base sensitivity specificity combination well area receiver operate characteristic curve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive eligible patient present study institution associate clinic enrol . Inclusion exclusion criterion detail separately section eligibility . The target enrollment population list study design section provide great 85 % power achieve pre-specified goal sensitivity specificity pre-specified model . Saliva collect vial pre fill mRNA stabilizer . Seven mRNA biomarkers ( BRAF , CCNI , EGRF , FGF19 , FRS2 , GREB1 , LZTS1 ) measure central laboratory quantitative PCR laboratory personnel blind patient diagnosis . The primary outcome validation pre-specified multi-marker model . This pre-specified model incorporate 3 cancer gene housekeep gene . The model validate base sum sensitivity specificity exceed 1.3 low limit 95 % confidence interval exceed 1.0 . A secondary endpoint development new multi-maker model potential improved performance . These new model develop logistic regression compare pre-specified model base area receiver operate characteristic curve maximum sum sensitivity specificity . Individual candidate biomarkers also validate base statistically significant up-regulation cancer patient compare control . Potential new housekeep gene evaluate base equivalence cancer control well performance multi-marker model comparison pre-specified housekeeping gene GADPH..</detailed_description>
