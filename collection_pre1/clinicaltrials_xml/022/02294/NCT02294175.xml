	<brief_summary>This prospective study Veterans chronic low extremity diabetic foot ulcer randomize either Larval Debridement Therapy group ( Biobags every 4 day x 2 application ) Sharp Debridement Therapy group ( standard control weekly x 2 ) 8 day study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Larval Debridement Therapy Versus Sharp Debridement Remove Biofilm From Chronic Lower Extremity Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug resistant organisms bacterial biofilm pose increase threat health million individual world-wide . These organism identify alarm prevalence among person chronic wound . The presence necrotic tissue associate deterioration open wound serf breed ground nutrient source bacteria . The removal necrotic tissue widely accept require optimal wound healing . The primary purpose study assess efficacy larval debridement therapy ( LDT ) bag , sterilize , live , medicinal blow fly ( Lucilia sericata ) larva ( `` BioBags '' ) versus bedside sharp debridement remove harmful bacteria , biofilm necrotic tissue chronic wound promote wound heal . Characteristics associate chronic wound environment evaluate analysis sample tissue take wound bed type debridement . One hundred forty patient â‰¥ 21 year age ( caregiver wound provider ) open , full thickness wound heal secondary intention ( great 8 week duration require debridement ) invite participate . This recruitment number account estimate 10 % attrition rate , final sample number anticipate 296 128 Veteran subject ( 64 arm ) 128 caregiver , 6 provider ( total 34 subject may lose follow ) . Samples wound bed tissue slough tissue ( present ) collect Days 0 , 4 8 prior larval debridement intervention sharp debridement ( control ) . Photos take wound bed Days 0 , 4 8 prior debridement method . A randomized sampling procedure place individual one two group : The intervention group receive larval debridement therapy every 4 day 2 application ( saline moisten gauze cover dress change daily ) control group receive sharp debridement therapy every 7 day 2 debridement ( wound gel dress change daily ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Veterans 21 year age chronic low extremity diabetic foot ulcer ( wound duration 8 week ) clinician 's judgment require wound debridement ( 25 % wound bed cover nonviable tissue ) wind size 1.5 cm ( roughly size quarter ) large diameter Cognitive impairment would interfere patient signing Informed Consent Veterans active anticoagulant therapy recent ( within last week ) PT/INR ( international normalize ratio prothrombin time ) &gt; 3.0 , significant bleeding risk Active immune suppression prior study ( systemic corticosteroids* within 7 day prior , chemotherapy cancer RA treatment within 4 week prior study , diagnosis HIV/AIDS ) *Nasal steroid spray exclude Active systemic antibiotic exclusion Absent dorsalis pedis pulse Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.5 exclusion ( indicate critical limb ischemia ) . Other possible reason participant could remove study include : transfer nonVA facility , participant unable tolerate tissue sample even local anesthesia , and/or inability comply schedule research visit . Furthermore , participant significant wound heal sample possible initial sampling , remove study .</criteria>
