	<detailed_description>It randomize , open-label , multi-centre trial patient symptomatic paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation randomize treatment either catheter ablation pulmonary vein isolation optimize conventional pharmacological therapy . Patients receive implantable cardiac monitor , Reveal XT , implant subcutaneously , two month `` Run-in '' period basic atrial fibrillation burden define , provide objective basis ass AF burden 3 year . After initiation randomize therapy , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 48 month . In case intolerable symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite allocated treatment , subject switch alternative regimen , patient 's request . The ablation consist pulmonary vein isolation paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation . A linear lesion leave atrial roof optional patient recurrence first procedure primarily patient persistent atrial fibrillation . A second ablation procedure may undertake early 3 month first procedure , symptoms persists recur . Epicardial off-pump ablation may offer fail attempt transvenous catheter ablation early 3 month late procedure . If second transvenous ablation procedure fail , patient may offer ) third transvenous ablation procedure ii ) epicardial off-pump procedure . In case patient decline third intervention despite recurrence , patient continue anti-arrhythmic drug . If new previously untested drug prescribe , patient define change treatment ( failed ablation ) . Ablation may perform use radiofrequency energy irrigate tip cryo-energy use Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter . A complete pulmonary vein isolation define document PV entrance block vein use circular mapping catheter . Anti-arrhythmic drug remain test rate rhythm control may include previously test tolerable antiarrhythmic drug dosage inadequate . Optimized anti-arrhythmic drug therapy include test available anti-arrhythmic drug adequate dosage , include amiodarone 600 mg daily 7-10 day , 100-200 mg daily thereafter ; sotalol : 80-160 mg twice daily ; flecainide 100 150 mg twice daily entire dose slow-release formula daily ; propafenone 300 mg twice daily ; disopyramide 250-375mg twice daily , potentially new antiarrhythmic drug commercially available study period . A monitor verify data record procedure form correct quarterly communication , review catheterization report medical record .

Adverse Events summarize per treatment group body system/system organ class , preferred term , intensity , seriousness relationship . Laboratory data efficacy present mean change table . The null hypothesis ( H0 ) difference mean change baseline 12 month baseline General Health two treatment zero ; - mean change treatment group catheter ablation ( μ 1 ) - mean change treatment group optimize conventional pharmacological therapy ( μ 2 ) Safety - All randomized patient include safety analysis . Only observed observation use safety analysis . Intention treat ( ITT ) - All randomized patient . The main analysis perform ITT-population . Per protocol ( PP ) - All randomized patient complete study treatment period 12 month without major protocol violation ( example ineligibility , early withdrawal , poor compliance ) . A subgroup analysis determine whether sinus rhythm obtain AF ablation superior sinus rhythm obtain pharmacological therapy rate and/or rhythm control . In addition comparison do patient sinus rhythm patient atrial fibrillation irrespective allocate therapy . Both analysis perform regard quality life , morbidity ( composite , see secondary endpoint 1 ) , cardiovascular hospitalization , exercise/ physical capacity , safety , health economy 12 24 month . All continuous variable present per treatment group use descriptive statistic mean , standard deviation , max min value , addition median , 25th 75th percentile present suitable .

All categorical secondary endpoint compare treatment group frequency table Fisher 's Exact Test include 95 % confidence interval possible . Adverse Events summarize per treatment group body system/system organ class , preferred term , intensity , seriousness relationship . Sample size consideration : The primary endpoint change General Health baseline 12 month baseline . Based previous study assume variable normally distribute standard deviation change General Health 20 unit expect difference group least 10.5 unit . To detect difference 10.5 unit General Health ( correspond improvement 15 % , assume mean General Health 70 unit conventional pharmacological therapy group ) power 80 % type I error 5 % ( two-sided alternative ) , sample size approximately 58 subject treatment group require , i.e . total number 116 patient . Another 20 patient added ensure calculated number patient analysis 12 month . The power detect difference 10.5 136 ( 116+20 ) 140 ( minimum expect total number ) patient 85 % 86 % , respectively . A 1:1 block randomization use within centre , stratify patient paroxysmal persistent AF .</detailed_description>
