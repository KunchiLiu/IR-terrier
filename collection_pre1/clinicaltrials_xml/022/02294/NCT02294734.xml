	<criteria>Between 40 80 year age inclusive , time signing inform consent The subject confirm establish diagnosis COPD , define global initiative chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline least 6 month prior entry . The subject postbronchodilator FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 0.7 FEV1 &lt; = 80 % predict ( Predictions accord European Community Coal Steel [ ECCS ] equation ) , document last 5 year . Disease severity : Acute exacerbation COPD require escalation therapy include corticosteroid antibiotic . Acute exacerbation confirm experienced physician represent recent change least two major one minor symptom , one major two minor symptom , 3 major symptom . Major symptom : subjective increase dyspnea , increase sputum volume , change sputum colour . Minor symptom : cough , wheeze sore throat . The subject smoker exsmoker smoke history least 10 pack year ( pack year = [ cigarette per day smoked/20 x number year smoke ] ) Body weight &gt; = 45 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18 32 kg/metered square ( m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Male Female subject : eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : document tubal ligation , document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , hysterectomy document bilateral oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause ( refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication completion followup visit . GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) : Contraceptive subdermal implant meet standard operate procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone . Injectable progestogen . Contraceptive vaginal ring . Percutaneous contraceptive patch . Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . Male condom combine vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) . Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication completion follow visit . Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . Male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option : Contraceptive subdermal implant meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone injectable progestogen . Contraceptive vaginal ring . Percutaneous contraceptive patch . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form study protocol . To avoid recruitment subject severe COPD exacerbation , presence one follow severity criterion render subject ineligible inclusion study : Need invasive mechanical ventilation ( short term ( &lt; 48hour ) Noninvasive Ventilation ( NIV ) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [ CPAP ] acceptable ) . Haemodynamic instability clinically significant heart failure . Confusion . Subjects history current medical condition disease well control , judge Investigator , may affect subject safety influence outcome study . ( Note : Patients adequately treat well control concurrent medical condition [ e.g . hypertension noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ] permit enter study ) . Subject diagnosis active tuberculosis , lung cancer , clinically overt bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , asthma respiratory condition might , opinion investigator , compromise safety subject affect interpretation result . Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include Investigator [ consultation GSK Medical Monitor require ] document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . ECG indicative acute cardiac event ( e.g . Myocardial Infarction ) demonstrate clinically significant arrhythmia require treatment . QTcF &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTcF &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block , base single QTcF value . Subjects undergone lung volume reduction surgery . Subject currently chronic treatment macrolides ; long term oxygen therapy ( &gt; 15 hours/day ) . The subject chronic treatment antiTumour Necrosis Factor ( antiTNF ) , antiInterleukin1 ( antiIL1 ) , immunosuppressive therapy within 60 day prior dose . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 28 unit male &gt; 21 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram alcohol : halfpint ( equivalent 240 milliliter [ mL ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof ( lactose ) history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . A know ( historical ) positive test human immune virus ( HIV ) antibody . Presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis C antibody test result screen within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . NOTE : Because short window screening , treatment GSK2269557 may start receive result hepatitis test . If subsequently test find positive , subject may withdraw , judge Principal Investigator consultation Medical Monitor . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure 4 investigational medicinal product within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
