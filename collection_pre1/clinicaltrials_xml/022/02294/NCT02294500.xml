	<detailed_description>Menopause last step process ovarian ageing . Decrease follicle number dictate onset cycle irregularity cessation menses . At time , decay oocyte quality contributes gradual decline fertility . Endocrine change mainly depend decline negative feedback ovarian factor hypothalamo-pituitary unit . The decline antral follicle cohort ( AFC ) age first result gradually elevate FSH level . The gradual decline size AFC best represent decreasing level anti-Mullerian hormone . The identification woman severely decreased ovarian reserve clinically relevant . Ovarian reserve test appear fairly accurate predict response ovarian stimulation assist reproductive technology ( ART ) setting . The capacity predict chance spontaneous pregnancy pregnancy ART appear limited . As menopause precede decline oocyte quality seem fix time interval , test predict age menopause may useful assess individual reproductive lifespan like genetic study , ovarian age mechanism study epigenetic study . Heart disease remain major cause death among woman China . We focus physiologic endogenous sex steroid level heart disease especially CAD among postmenopausal woman natural surgical menopause . Now reason seek evidence association circulate estrogen endogenous sex steroid level CAD . In future , design cohort study confirm whether ovarian sex steroid hormonal change associate CAD postmenopausal woman , may components explain gender difference CAD pattern . Premature ovarian failure ( POF ) , disorder infertility characterize amenorrhoea , low estrogen level increase gonadotropin level woman age &lt; 40 year . POF result premature exhaustion follicle pool attribute follicular dysfunction , example , owe mutation FSH receptor steroidogenic cell autoimmunity . Moreover , advance cancer therapeutic past decade lead increase survival rate paediatric adult malignancy . Given gonadotoxic effect many cancer treatment , woman develop POF . Markers predict whether woman risk POF would , therefore , aid early diagnosis fertility counselling . The history past present status take research . Women process natural age disease-induced ovarian aging include . The key factor influence ovary aging may identify epidemiological molecular biological research .</detailed_description>
