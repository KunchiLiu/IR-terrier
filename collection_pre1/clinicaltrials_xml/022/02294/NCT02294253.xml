Buprenorphine/naloxone dispense weekly 30-day stabilization twice weekly taper phase , patient successfully complete detoxification offer induction onto XR-NTX .

	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine induction/stabilization/taper : Buprenorphine induction conduct STARS clinic accord current clinical guideline . Participants initially fail outpatient induction onto XR-NTX receive buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP ) weekly basis take daily , accord follow schedule : 8/2 mg ( Days 1-10 ) , 6/1.5 mg ( Days 11-15 ) , 4/1 mg ( Days 16-20 ) , 3.0/0.75 mg ( Days 21-25 ) , 2.0/0.5 mg ( Days 26-30 ) . Participants attend clinic twice weekly assess opioid substance use ( urine toxicology self-report ) , vital sign , opioid withdrawal symptom , opioid craving , dose adjustment buprenorphine make need study physician . If dose reduction need , stabilization taper schedule adjust occur 30 day . Participants stabilize , taper , buprenorphine 4-week period.Reductions occur graded fashion , stabilization dose reduce 2 mg . This approach buprenorphine taper intend resemble standard clinical practice , patient seek transition buprenorphine undergo slow taper . A gradual taper approximately 4 week establish precedent ( Sigmon et al . 2013 , Ling et al . 2009 , Nielsen et al . 2013 ) well-tolerated taper strategy transition buprenorphine . The purpose part provide slow transition minimal withdrawal symptom . Participants least two study visit week buprenorphine taper , may see regularly STARS deem clinically necessary . Naltrexone induction procedure : Participants successfully complete taper must complete two-day washout ( abstinence opioids , buprenorphine ) . During 48-hr period , participant report STARS clinic daily vital sign monitor receive ancillary medication ( clonidine , clonazepam , zolpidem , prochlorperazine ) alleviate withdrawal discomfort need . After abstinence &gt; /=48 hour last buprenorphine dose , allow mu receptor availability , participant begin naltrexone induction , use 4-day ascend taper oral naltrexone ( 1 , 3 , 12 , 25 mg ) , follow injection naltrexone . The administration naltrexone occur within detoxification suite provide STARS , consist private room outfit two comfortable recline lounge chair rest , adjustable lighting , entertainment system . Participants monitor clinical staff least every 1-2 hour frequent vital sign check withdrawal assessment . A research psychiatrist study physician present time conduct frequent clinical assessment provide adjuvant medication naltrexone . Patients monitor daily basis ( Monday Friday ) 8 hour per day . Transportation home car service provide end day patient deem clinical need . On Day 1 naltrexone induction , participant pre-treated prochlorperazine 10 mg nausea , follow first dose naltrexone 1mg . Ascending dos naltrexone titrate upward slowly ( 3mg , 12mg , 25mg ) . Adjuvant medication available patient include clonidine myalgia , prochlorperazine nausea , clonazepam reduce anxiety dysphoria , trazodone zolpidem insomnia . Participants provide take-home dos adjuvant medication small dos taper schedule one week post-administration XR-NTX . Participants require visit clinic daily remain least 1 hour permit close monitoring , option stay long necessary achieve relief symptom medical stability prior discharge home . Once 25 mg naltrexone tolerate , participant may receive 380 mg IM XR-NTX . Additionally , female participant , urine pregnancy test obtain day XR-NTX administration . Prior administration XR-NTX , participants non-compliant oral naltrexone schedule , accompany lapse opioid use , case challenge appear clinically indicate judgment study physician research team , receive naloxone challenge prior XR-NTX administration . Referrals local treatment provider arrange participant successfully complete study request continue XR-NTX maintenance XR-NTX injection : XR-NTX administer naltrexone 25 mg tolerate , intramuscular injection ( 380 mg ) one buttock one research psychiatrists research nurse STARS , currently train administer XR-NTX protocol . Participants observe least 2 hour first injection . Participants offer second injection Week 5 ( four week post-administration first injection ) , third injection Week 9 . Prior receive second third injection STARS , patient either provide opioid-negative urine pas naloxone challenge test . At STARS visit patient meet research assistant complete research rating , include self-report withdrawal , mood , drug use . Blood sample draw accord protocol naltrexone serum level liver enzymes . The patient provide urine sample observation staff member visit . STARS staff male female research assistant urines appropriately monitor . All participant receive weekly medication adherence-focused psychosocial intervention inform relapse prevention strategy previously develop Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy deliver study physician ( Rothenberg , Sullivan et al . 2002 ) . We develop relapse prevention approach include emphasis compliance NTX . Participants receive therapy weekly visit outpatient Weeks 1-12 follow induction onto XR-NTX .</detailed_description>
