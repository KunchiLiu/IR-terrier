	<brief_title>Excimer Laser Phototherapy Outcomes Treatment Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , assessor-blinded clinical trial determine whether novel plaque-based dosimetry strategy improve speed response excimer laser treatment patient plaque psoriasis . Each patient receive plaque-based dose one side body conventional dosing contralateral side . This design base assumption psoriasis usually affect patient symmetric distribution ( e.g. , knee elbow ) effect excimer laser phototherapy limit treated plaque . The side body treat plaque-based dosimetry assign use table random number . The assessor blind treatment group . Each patient treat 1-2 time per week discretion investigator maximum 10 treatment .</detailed_description>
