	<brief_summary>Social anxiety represent one prevalent comorbid condition schizophrenia relate psychosis . Schizophrenia patient comorbid social anxiety often exhibit impaired social functioning , increase risk relapse , high rate suicide . Social anxiety treatable condition , context psychosis , receive scant attention thus far . There strong evidence cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) treatment social anxiety effective , whether deliver individually group set , study show group set effective individual therapy . Providing CBT intervention social anxiety represent effective way empower people illness . The investigator conduct preliminary study use uncontrolled design ass feasibility initial benefit new manualized group CBT intervention social anxiety specifically adapted people psychosis . The investigator observe significant reduction social anxiety symptom across three group first episode psychosis ( FEP ) participant ( n=29 ) follow completion 13-week intervention , observed large effect size confirm significant positive influence intervention . The investigator propose conduct randomize control trial fully assess efficacy intervention . The main objective research proposal contrast impact CBT intervention treatment social anxiety first episode psychosis another control condition involve computer assist cognitive remediation therapy ( CACRT ) . Both intervention offer group set , therefore exact parameter . A secondary objective study examine impact reduce social anxiety measure clinical functional outcome . For trial , 120 patient recent onset psychotic disorder ( define within 5 year first episode psychosis ) social anxiety clinically assess . These participant recruit five different first episode psychosis program Montreal area refer treatment team . They randomly assign either CBT CACRT condition . Both intervention involve 13 weekly group session . At end group intervention two follow-up ( 3-month &amp; 6-month ) , presence severity social anxiety symptom assess . It hypothesize compare CACRT group , individual receive CBT intervention show reduction symptom associate social anxiety ( determined multiple self-report clinician rat measure ) . This effect maintain follow-up . In addition , investigator also hypothesize CBT group show well clinical outcome , define length symptomatic remission follow-up . For functional outcome , show significant improvement self-report measure clinician-rated measure recovery . This study one first specifically target social anxiety people psychosis use psychosocial intervention .

	<detailed_description>Preamble Social anxiety highly prevalent people schizophrenia relate psychotic disorder , represent major obstacle positive functional outcome . The investigator recently develop psychosocial intervention social anxiety specifically tailored people psychosis . An adapted Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) intervention psychosis must target stigma attached illness , possible presence poor social skill , delusional persecutory idea , potential limit reading ability , associate cognitive deficit hallmark schizophrenia relate psychosis . Our preliminary data uncontrolled evaluation new intervention first episode psychosis reveal significant positive impact 13-week group intervention manifestation social anxiety . Following promising result , investigator propose conduct multi-center randomize control trial test efficacy intervention relative active control condition consist cognitive remediation group . Their primary goal show efficacy intervention symptom social anxiety determine self-report measure clinician-rated measure . Their secondary goal examine impact intervention clinical functional outcome . The highly impairing nature social anxiety psychosis well establish propose trial ultimately show treat aspect condition possible result improve functioning . From 2010 2012 , investigator offer CBT intervention social anxiety several group patient Douglas Institute , recently , McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) . The investigator employ uncontrolled design recommend evaluate feasibility potential benefit pilot psychosocial intervention . In feasibility study , offer intervention five group client part Prevention Early Intervention Program Psychosis ( PEPP-Montreal ) two group client longer stand illness , Psychosis Program Douglas Institute MUHC , respectively . All participant refer treat team ( e.g . psychiatrist , nurse , case manager , etc . ) screen research team evaluate presence significant social anxiety . They assess effect intervention use four scale : Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ( SIAS ) , Social Phobia Inventory ( SPIN ) Brief Social Phobia Scale ( BSPS ) , Structured Clinical Diagnosis ( SCID-I ) Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM-IV ) . Focusing work FEP program PEPP-Montreal , 25 29 participant recruit feasibility study meet diagnostic criterion social phobia , whereas 4 represented 'borderline ' case clearly report significant difficulty social interaction active avoidance social situation . From 29 client start group intervention , 3 complete ( completion define attend 50 % session ) . The overall attendance rate completers weekly 13-week program excellent , average 11 session attend per participant ( range 9-13 ) , confirm intervention well tolerated participant . For 26 patient complete intervention , significant reduction social anxiety observe three measure ( SPIN , SIAS , BSPS ) end 13-week treatment . We observe effect size 1.04 SIAS , 0.93 SPIN , 0.95 BSPS , correct within-subject dependence among mean total sample participant complete intervention . These effect size quite large represent strong justification pursue larger-scale investigation novel intervention . Critically , 24 participant SCID-I base diagnosis social phobia prior treatment , two still meet diagnostic criterion end study . Moreover , investigator administer Internalized Stigma Mental Illness ( ISMI ) scale observe significant reduction stigma follow intervention ( p &lt; .01 ) , suggest intervention indeed target stigma efficient way . Having establish potential benefit new psychosocial intervention social anxiety , investigator devise control condition reproduce aspect group intervention without active ingredient group CBT . An active control condition could control spontaneous change symptoms social anxiety , effect trial , therapeutic commitment chosen . In selection active control condition , essential intervention target social anxiety still control non-specific effect describe . As discussed Everitt , control intervention target symptoms interest potentially lead great effect size experimental treatment control condition , require small sample . Several researcher attest appropriateness cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT ) control condition CBT intervention : two recent large multi-center trial involve group CBT intervention improve patient ' insight illness improve negative symptom use CRT active control condition . CRT targetting cognitive performance offer group format thus represent promise control condition propose study . Several computer-assisted cognitive remediation therapy ( CACRT ) develop last year . Many program develop specifically psychiatric patient follow structure protocol give small group supervision train therapist . The goal program improve performance cognitive domain determine hind functioning . The intervention aim provide positive experience patient promotion positive attitude towards learning , patient encourage develop independent learning skill well sense competence confidence . The intervention also design increase awareness strengths weaknesses patient ' learning style . This particular method advantageous goal match psychiatric rehabilitation model theoretical base neuropsychology , learning , educational psychology , rehabilitation psychology , self-determination , client-centered therapy . Furthermore , CRT show effective improve patient ' cognitive ability less impact social functioning . Since fall 2011 , investigator develop group CRT program collaboration Psychosis Program Douglas Institute present result recent scientific conference . The investigator propose use Dr. Christopher Bowie 's protocol current study . This psychosocial intervention represent excellent control condition randomize controlled trial : conduct group format comparable propose group CBT intervention , control potential non-specific effect simply participate group activity . Additionally , although group activity , social interaction limit participant spends time work individually computer . Proposed study General aim : The goal research proposal evaluate efficacy group CBT intervention ( experimental condition ) social anxiety first-episode psychosis comparison group-based cognitive remediation ( control condition ) reduce symptom social anxiety . Primary objective : To compare efficacy 13-week group CBT intervention adapt people psychosis reduce symptom social anxiety active control condition comprise 13-week group cognitive remediation therapy . Primary hypothesis : Compared active control group , individual receive brief manualized CBT intervention show reduction symptom associate social anxiety , determine Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ( SIAS ) , Social Phobia Inventory ( SPIN ) Brief Social Phobia Scale ( BSPS ) end 13 week intervention follow-up assessment ( 3- 6-months ) . In addition , few participant receive CBT meet DSM-IV diagnostic criterion social phobia end study . Secondary objective : To measure effect group CBT intervention social anxiety first episode psychosis clinical outcome functional outcome . Secondary hypothesis : Following treatment trial CBT group show well clinical outcome relative control group , define length symptomatic remission follow-up . For functional outcome , show significant improvement self-report measure recovery ( Recovery Assessment Scale ) clinician-rated measure , Social Occupational Functioning Scale ( SOFAS ) 3- 6-month follow-up . Methods Study design : A randomized control trial conduct compare experimental group , receive group CBT social anxiety plus standard care , active control group receive CACRT standard care . During randomization process repartition participant , two group match severity social anxiety , level function gender ( describe ) order avoid initial group inequality . Participants assess treatment . They also ask return completion two follow-up assessment ( 3- 6-months ) order measure effect treatment time verify whether hypothesize therapeutic gain maintain . As part follow-up evaluation , participant complete various questionnaire scale . Participants : This study take place Montreal involve five first-episode psychosis clinic affiliate McGill University Université de Montréal ( UdeM ) . These include PEPP-Montréal , Douglas Institute ( Director Dr Ashok Malla , co-investigator ) , First Episode Psychosis Program Jewish General Hospital ( Director Dr. G. Eric Jarvis , co-investigator ) , First Episode Psychosis Program MUHC ( Director Dr. Howard Margolese , co-investigator ) McGill network , The Clinique Jeunes Adultes Psychotiques Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal ( CHUM ) ( Director Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki , co-investigator ) Programme des Premiers Épisodes Psychotiques Institut Universitaire de Santé Mentale de Montréal ( Director Dr. Luc Nicole , co-investigator ) UdeM . These relate first episode psychosis program provide complete range service adults suffer psychosis , include evaluation , prevention , treatment , hospitalization , outpatient family service , rehabilitation , modify assertive community case management , variable community follow-up . These program provide follow-up five year . Collectively , five first-episode program service entire population Montreal ( 2.2 million ) 1000 active patient addition accept 300 new client per year . Screening potential participant : Recruitment participant facilitate co-investigators , clinical head different service involve study , culture integration clinical care research characterize different program . Clinical assessment : After screen perform informed consent obtain , participant administer Structured Clinical Diagnosis ( SCID ) DSM-IV confirm diagnosis psychotic disorder collaboration research psychiatrist . If diagnosis confirm eligibility study establish , participant undergo thorough clinical assessment intake , 3-month 6-month follow-up , end therapy . Symptom evaluation include Scale Assessment Positive Symptoms ( SAPS ) Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , well Calgary Depression Scale . Social anxiety assess via three scale : SIAS 20-item scale measure anxiety interpersonal encounter ; SPIN 17-item scale assess multiple dimension social anxiety include fear , avoidance physiological discomfort ; Brief Social Phobia Scale ( BSPS ) 11-item clinician-rated assessment scale develop Davidson specifically measure fear , avoidance autonomic physiological response usually associated common social situation . In addition , social phobia module SCID-I use confirm diagnosis social phobia . We extensive experience administer instrument raters achieve high level inter-rater reliability ( ICC 0.79-.92 ) . Finally , Recovery Assessment Scale ( RAS ) Social Occupational Functioning Scale ( SOFAS ) administer . The RAS 41-item self-report measure examine multiple dimension functional recovery perceive patient him/herself . SOFAS use evaluate individual 's level social occupational functioning independent overall severity psychiatric symptom . The rating do first allocate category ( 1-10 ) base description category applies individual , follow numerical score within category . Neuropsychological assessment : Initial assessment participant include Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) , pen paper intelligence quotient ( IQ ) test consist 4 sub-scales ( Vocabulary , Similarities , Block Design , Matrix Reasoning ) . It administer part initial assessment treatment . Participants also evaluate use CogState , computerize cognitive battery 11 task evaluate 7 cognitive domain ( reasoning/problem solving , speed processing , attention/vigilance , visual learn memory , verbal learn memory , work memory social cognition ) . Both administer trained evaluator supervision neuropsychologist . The CogState repeatable neuropsychological battery specifically design schizophrenia relate psychosis . This assessment use : confirm participant present IQ least 70 ; explore impact CACRT neurocognitive performance ; explore whether cognitive performance predictive treatment response CBT , suggest . Procedure participant recruitment group randomization : Potential participant identify clinical staff , collaboration project coordinator , within participate early psychosis program . In case , client indicate treat team wish learn research study refer investigator . Once formal consent obtain initial screening procedure complete , research coordinator ass participant 's overall functioning eligibility current study conduct Global Assessment Scale ( GAF ) , show numerous study reliable valid clinical measure function . This measure allow researcher match participant cognitive ability ( i.e . intermediate read level ) language ( i.e . informal participant-report language proficiency ) also functionality . The score use stratification score 50 , identify `` high functional '' versus `` low functional '' participant . In addition , participant ask fill SIAS , SPIN BSPS , score cut-off value describe approach study . A brief description psychosocial intervention ( CBT CACRT ) offer referral source case refer research coordinator . During initial session , research staff conduct semi-structured interview , Social Phobia / Anxiety sub-scale SCID-I . Random assignment carry use computer-run randomization protocol , improve upon chance allocation give group adjust assignment probability base upon frequency characteristic current group membership key intake characteristic could influence outcomes . A biostatistician ( co-applicant Norbert Schmitz ) connect treatment capacity locate away treatment site carry randomization . Recruitment participant symptom assessment conduct , respectively , research coordinator research assistant , latter blind treatment . After random assignment complete , appointment therapy session schedule assign receive CBT assign receive CACRT . We expect take four year complete recruitment study . Treatment fidelity quality control measure : To ensure intervention carry accordance detail guideline provide respective manual , put place quality control measure . For group CBT , use approach develop one co-investigator ( T.L . ) specific group intervention early psychosis . Briefly , session audiotaped group adaptation Cognitive- Behavioral Therapy Scale complete two experienced CBT therapist . The audiotape first 5 session every group review two experienced CBT therapist offer supervision therapist . Afterward , approximately 1 every 3 session examine , request . For active control condition involve cognitive remediation , Dr. Bowie ( co-investigator ) , extensive experience field , responsible quality control . Dr. Bowie already conduct several randomize control trial use cognitive remediation intervention . Therapists train registered clinical psychologist senior clinician 12 year experience cognitive remediation . Medication : Medications monitor monthly use information multiple source ( case manager , psychiatrist , patient ) ensure result due change medication . Blinding evaluation : While well acknowledge conduct classical double blind evaluation randomize control trial ( RCT ) psychosocial intervention feasible , believe important conduct blind evaluation study outcomes . Therefore , evaluation conduct trained bilingual rater involvement conduct study , delivery intervention involvement trial-related meeting . Clinical trial management : The steer committee meet regular basis , every three month .</detailed_description>
