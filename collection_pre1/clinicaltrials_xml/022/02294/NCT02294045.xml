	<brief_summary>Clinical-noninvasive record sound knee brief load range motion . Description phase 1 analytic descriptive well phase 2 . No sample sound record . The device know microphone attached skin knee elastic material . Sound record analyzed lap top computer Adobe software .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Joint Sounds Diagnosis Knee Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need less expensive universally available screen device knee , joint pathology . The equipment use ultrasound much less expensive cumbersome x-ray magnetic resonance imaging . The equipment use analysis sound produce body order magnitude less expensive ultrasound ; laptop computer currently available software inexpensive transducer . Analysis sound prove useful Pulmonology Cardiology . We believe sound analysis provide useful yet inexpensive tool primary care physicians well musculoskeletal specialist . Phase 1 : Establish normal sound pattern emanate uninjured knee ; look influence age , height weight . Phase 2 : To record analyze preoperative sound pattern knee pathology , know MRI arthroscopy , compare normal sound Phase 1 .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Phase I Healthy Individuals . No neurological problem . No knee complaint . No previous Surgery Knee injury . Phase II Patients undergo knee arthroscopy preop MRI . The inclusion base age group , 20 year age , 40 60 . Neurologic Disease Previous serious injury ( Fracture dislocation ) . Previous Ligament reconstruction . Major nonsubtitle problem knee . ( This would create overwhelming noise ) .</criteria>
