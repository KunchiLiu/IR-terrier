	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase II study evaluate safety effectiveness ( good bad effect ) carfilzomib give 30-minute infusion dose 70 mg/m2 treat patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) , currently show progressive disease ( worsen ) progress ( respond treatment ) within 8 week receive treatment 27mg/m2 carfilzomib . Carfilzomib approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use certain U.S. patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma try failed therapy . Carfilzomib consider investigational drug study dose regimen include study different FDA approve carfilzomib regimen . Carfilzomib type drug call proteasome inhibitor . Carfilzomib think work prevent breakdown abnormal protein cell , cause cell die . Cancer cell sensitive effect normal cell . Carfilzomib previously give 1800 people clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , open label , non-randomized study evaluate safety efficacy 30-minute infusion 70 mg/m2 carfilzomib among MM patient currently show progressive disease ( PD ) fail last treatment 27mg/m2 carfilzomib alone part combination regimen . The study consist 1 ) screening period ; 2 ) eight 28-day , treatment cycle ; 3 ) maintenance treatment ; 4 ) final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle ; 5 ) follow-up period.The study enroll total 45 patient currently show PD progress within 8 week receive last treatment 27mg/m2 carfilzomib alone part combination regimen . Patients enrol 15 hematology/oncology site across United States . During treatment period , dose carfilzomib give 70 mg/m2 infuse 30 minute . Among patient receive steroids equivalent &gt; 8 mg dexamethasone weekly carfilzomib , steroid administer use drug ( ) dose ( ) schedule ( ) receive previous carfilzomib treatment . Patients receive steroid receive equivalent less 8 mg dexamethasone weekly give 8 mg dexamethasone prior carfilzomib administration . Carfilzomib administer facility capable manage hypersensitivity reaction . Pre- post-dose intravenous ( IV ) hydration ( 250 mL 500 mL normal saline appropriate IV fluid formulation ) may give discretion treat physician . Subjects monitor periodically period evidence fluid overload . Subjects complete 8 cycle without show PD eligible receive maintenance therapy 28-day cycle carfilzomib steroid administer last cycle treatment period.During maintenance ( cycle 9 beyond ) carfilzomib administer dose receive last cycle study treatment Days 1 , 8 15 , steroid administer use drug ( ) dose ( ) schedule ( ) give last cycle study treatment . Patients remain maintenance therapy documentation PD define modify Bladé criterion develop toxicity . Patients stable disease ( SD ) remain maintenance therapy . Dose reduction carfilzomib steroid permit per protocol guideline .</detailed_description>
