	<detailed_description>Trochanteric fracture represent half hip fracture ( femoral neck fracture half ) , almost always treat surgically internal fixation fracture . However , ongoing debate appropriate implant use . For stable fracture pattern evidence seem favour slide hip screw , whereas unstable fracture unclear whether intramedullary nail slide hip screw without lateral support plate implant choice . A series study plan Oslo University Hospital collaboration Diakonhjemmet Hospital hope clarify debate . The use lateral/trochanteric support plate ( TSP ) widespread region ( e.g . Norway , Sweden part Britain ) , virtually never use place . The role TSP remain unclear little publish 's use , even though believe important contributor stability slide hip screw construct . Trochanteric fracture mainly cause direct trauma , i.e mainly fall height elderly . The fracture often classify use Müller AO classification Evans/Jensen , several classification system also exist . The ideal classification system easily applicable , reliable , aid treatment decision making . The treatment trochanteric fracture comprise perioperative operative modality . The perioperative modality consist among others medical optimalization preoperatively , early rehabilitation prevention new fracture treat osteoporosis prevent new fall . The main scope current study , however , operative modality . Surgery trochanteric fracture perform mainly fracture reduction traction table internal fixation , use either intramedullary ( IM ) nail slide hip screw ( SHS ) , available various design different manufacturer . The late Cochrane review conclude implant superior . However , among stable fracture le reoperations SHS , mainly due peri-implant femoral fracture operation IM nail . The unstable fracture , namely reverse oblique subtrochanteric fracture , may obtain good result use intramedullary nail , probably due less secondary dislocation result varus deformity , shaft-medialization shortening . The evidence , however , weak role TSP remain unclear . Radiostereometry ( RSA ) precise accurate method measure motion vivo different segment orthopaedic research . To , radio-opaque tantalum marker implant bone define different segment . Stereoradiographs perform time detect movement monitor healing ( non heal ) process . This movement calculate translation rotation . They ideal describe compare stability fracture system . RSA use successfully early study fracture heal . Due high accuracy precision , RSA yield reliable result relatively small study-groups . We plan use RSA measure fracture dislocation time heal study . The study function trochanteric support plate it´s ability prevent secondary dislocation AO 31 A2 fracture . We utilize RSA measurement follow-up .</detailed_description>
