	<brief_title>VST-1001 ( Dilute Fluorescein ) Lymphatic Mapping &amp; Localization Lymph Nodes Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single center prospective , non randomize , single arm , open label , single dose VST-1001 study lymphatic mapping localization lymph node drain primary tumor site patient clinically node negative breast cancer . This study evaluate combine modality technique investigational VST-1001 companion medical device ( replace blue dye ) 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid concordance lymphatic mapping localization lymph node patient undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) surgical procedure . This purpose Phase I study determine safe effective recommend dose VST-1001 intraoperative lymphatic mapping localization lymph node drain breast tumor . The purpose Phase II study evaluate Phase I study recommend dose VST-1001 evaluate ability provide intraoperative visualization lymphatic system lymph node drain primary tumor patient diagnose breast cancer .</detailed_description>
