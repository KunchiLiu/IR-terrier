	<detailed_description>It realize micronutrient deficiency major determinant intra-uterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) multiple trial use micronutrient supplementation pregnancy do &amp; show positive effect birth weight.UNICEF/WHO/United Nations University ( UNU ) design new multiple micro nutrient supplement pregnant lactate women—the UNICEF/WHO/UNU international multiple micro nutrient preparation ( UNIMMAP ) —that provide Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) 15 vitamin mineral . The benefit supplementation routinely prescribe iron folic supplementation proven multiple trial . Evidence show reduction low birth newborn . This randomize controlled trial compare effect calories multiple micro nutrient provide energy dense biscuit manufacture EBM malnourish pregnant woman see AKU 's Department Paediatrics Child Health Ali Akbar Shah Goth Ibrahim Hyderi , compare food supplementation ration wheat oil , plus iron folic acid tablet supplementation . Arm 1 : Dietary supplementation EBM biscuits contain multiple vitamin calcium recommend allowance ( RDA ) pregnant woman Arm 2 : Supplementation Wheat flour oil , iron folic acid All undernourished pregnant female identify 14 week gestation surveillance system offer enrollment . First contact : First meeting enrollment . Patients randomize one arm . After randomization Weight , height , MUAC BMI record . Samples Ferritin &amp; hemoglobin drawn . In Arm 1 participant supply energy dense biscuits arm 2 provide Wheat flour oil every two week . End trimester : In second ( 20-22 week ) &amp; third trimester ( 33-35 week ) weight , MUAC &amp; BMI record . Supplementation give accord Arm . Samples also draw Ferritin &amp; hemoglobin third visit . Also third trim visit palatability , accessibility compliance biscuit assess fill preform questionnaire . Follow newborn : Follow newborn do within 48 hour . Length , weight , fronto-occipital circumference MUAC record .</detailed_description>
