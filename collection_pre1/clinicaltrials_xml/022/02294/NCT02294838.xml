	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : Feasibility define 80 % volunteer achieve detectable signal change pre/post salivary MR image ( either IVIM DCE scan ) . BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE It well know loss salivary function parotid glands lead elevate risk chronically dry-mouth . Xerostomia think result salivary function loss due damage functional aspect ( saliva-producing ) parotid gland , precise nature unknown . Recent report find regional dose susceptibility rat parotid ( 1 ) ; deliver dose one region parotid result different incidence xerostomia would dose another region . Similarly , regional dose susceptibility subjective xerostomia ( i.e . patient-reported ) note human parotid ( 2 ) . It presently unclear extent finding relate objective functional loss , recovery , xerostomia human . With motivation , investigator launch preliminary project search change parotid salivary function result irradiation treatment head-and-neck cancer . The Investigators hypothesis certain region parotid susceptible radiation damage others . To test hypothesis , data collect prospectively one-hundred patient underwent head-and-neck cancer treatment analyze correlation regional dose salivary function response . Three-dimensional dose distribution harvest patient dose data organ contour sub- segment variety regional `` piece '' . Sub-segmentation guide clinical recommendation . Saliva output collect clinical staff compare treatment provide quantitative mean establish salivary response . The investigator able demonstrate salivary function loss recovery , unable demonstrate regional susceptibility . It find simple ( scalar ) saliva measurement anatomical information alone provide enough information functional biology investigator try describe . To investigate method obtain functional data , investigator engage Dr Stefan Reinsberg - researcher Department Physics Astronomy UBC . He develop method clinical preclinical MRI diagnosis , plan treatment monitoring cancer . Techniques particular interest dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI diffusion-weighted imaging . Through advanced statistical mean attempt maximize information obtain functional status tissue investigation . As precise site radiation damage think functional component ( i.e. , parenchyma ) parotid , belief use patient-specific three dimensional anatomical functional information key understanding . Therefore , previous data collection use augment non-invasive technique , know Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI ) , allow u precisely quantify regional gland function also provide clear view glandular anatomy . This data collect optimize technique preliminary ( proof concept ) intend future protocol perform head-and-neck Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment patient three instance : prior radiotherapy , three month one year conclusion treatment . TRIAL DESIGN Sample size 10 , proof concept feasibility trial preliminary data utilized future study patient undergo active radiotherapy . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA There NO EXCEPTIONS eligibility requirement time registration . Questions eligibility criterion address PRIOR registration . The eligibility criterion study carefully consider . Eligibility criteria standard use ensure patient enter study medically appropriate candidate therapy . For safety participant , well ensure result study useful make treatment decision regard patient similar disease , important exception make criterion admission study . Participants must fulfill follow criterion eligible admission study : Age ≥ 18 Healthy normal volunteer INELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Subjects fulfill follow criterion eligible admission study : Pregnant woman Scheduled take unusual uncommon chemotherapy agent medication Previous undertake course radiotherapy Previous surgery neck lymph node dissection . Must , willing replace , metal filling foreign object seriously impede image collection analysis . No contraindication MRI PRE- MRI EVALUATION Biochemistry Creatinine ( GFR ) &lt; 100 Dental assessment Check MRI check list ensure suitability REGISTRATION PROCEDURES ENTRY PROCEDURES A reason ineligibility record participant screen study find ineligible . A record keep eligible participant decline participation . TRIAL PROCEDURES MRI scan take place University British Columbia Vancouver . Tissue relaxation constant ( T1 ) magnetization value ( M0 ) map derived 3 spoiled gradient echo ( GE ) image acquire flip angle α = 2◦ , 10◦ , 30◦ , 1×1×2 mm spatial resolution , image technique/contrast parameter TR = 2.8 m TE = 0.9 ms. T1 M0 map compute use image data use L-M fitting algorithm accord steady state signal equation . Perfusion image acquire use time-resolved , spoil GE sequence 1×1×2 mm spatial resolution , approximately one second 3D temporal resolution , image technique/contrast parameter TR = 2.8 m TE = 0.9 m . Upon commencement scan , 0.05 ml/kg Gadovist ( 4 ml/s ) 20 ml saline flush ( also 4 ml/s ) administer . Approximately three minute scan commencement , salivary gland stimulate orally administer small portion ( ≈5 ml ) lemon juice . Total perfusion scan time expect 10 minute , superior/inferior scan length choose encompass parotid submandibular gland . Time dependent concentration map derive perfusion image pre-contrast T1 M0 map . An `` extended Kety '' -type model fit data intent extract follow physiologically-descriptive quantity ( 'metrics ' ) : volume plasma/volume tissue ( νp ) , Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ( ADC ) , volume extracellular extravascular space per volume tissue ( νe ) , contrast agent transfer coefficient ( Ktrans ) . Equipment 2 % citric Acid deliver oral cavity via syringe Tygon tube two separate time interval order stimulate parotid gland . EVALUATION DURING AND AFTER PROTOCOL TREATMENT A train medical personnel present MRI procedure ensure patient safety maintain . After scan complete volunteer require attend follow appointment . ADVERSE EVENTS Definition Reportable Serious Adverse Event All serious adverse event unexpected relate protocol Investigation must report expedited manner ( see Section 11.2 reporting instruction ) . These include event occur MRI scan ( 30 day ) time afterwards . Unexpected adverse event consistent either nature severity information contain product monograph package insert . Adverse event consider related protocol investigation relationship protocol investigation reasonably rule . A serious adverse event ( SAE ) adverse event : result death , life-threatening , require inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization ( exclude hospital admission study drug administration , transfusion , schedule elective surgery admission palliative terminal care ) , result persistent significant disability incapacity congenital anomaly/birth defect Medical scientific judgement exercise decide whether expedite reporting appropriate situation important medical event may immediately life-threatening result death hospitalization may jeopardize subject may require intervention prevent one event list . Serious Adverse Event Reporting Instructions All reportable serious adverse event must report within 3 day Research Ethics Board . PROTOCOL DISCONTINUATION Criteria Discontinuing Protocol Treatment participant may stop protocol : Intercurrent illness Unacceptable toxicity define Section 14.4 Request subject Safety Monitoring Adverse event contrast agent ( Gadovist ) monitor ongoing basis study team . Any grade 5 toxicity ( death ) possibly , probably definitely cause contrast agent result suspension accrual investigation investigator team . Any life threaten reaction Nephrogenic Systemic fibrosis result suspension accrual investigation investigator team . Although image formally review radiologist , possible imaging may identify unexpected abnormality . The participant issue diagnostic report however abnormality detect , participant general practitioner ( participant permission ) inform investigation appropriate referral make .</detailed_description>
