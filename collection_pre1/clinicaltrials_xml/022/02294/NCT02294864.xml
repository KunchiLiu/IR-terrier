	<brief_summary>It estimate nearly 27 million US adult osteoarthritis ( OA ) suffer pain . Pulsed Radio Frequency ( PRF ) one method successfully use treatment various etiology pain . However limited study research prove effectiveness treat articular pain . The propose study 's primary aim determine PRF effective treatment chronic osteoarthritic knee pain . This study hypothesize PRF analgesic property immediately treatment least 3 month afterwards compare control treatment physical therapy . Additionally research project address several objective include : 1 . Provide control study determine effectiveness PRF intra-articular pain 2 . Determine effective PRF 1 month 3 month treatment articular pain . 3 . Further scientific evidence overall effectiveness PRF 4 . Provide evidence PRF likely mechanism action besides direct nerve stimulation inhibitory pain pathway . 5 . Compare effectiveness PRF v Physical Therapy treat chronic knee osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>
