	<brief_summary>Diarrhoea commonly report adverse event ( AE ) associate Lapatinib treatment , also commonly associate Capecitabine treatment . Although event generally mild moderate severity , diarrhoea adversely affect tolerability cancer treatment , severe case diarrhoea potential affect efficacy treatment due poor compliance , treatment interruption withdrawal . The efficacy Octreotide management cancer treatment-associated diarrhoea extensively evaluate large , well-controlled study . This randomised , multi-centre , open-label Phase II study subject Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer progress follow prior therapy , must include anthracyclines taxanes therapy Trastuzumab metastatic setting . This study placebo control , active comparator . The study evaluate whether prophylactic use Octreotide Long Acting Release ( LAR ) offer clinically meaningful benefit reduce frequency severity diarrhoea associate treatment Lapatinib Capecitabine . Study completion subject define completion 24 week treatment Lapatinib Capecitabine , progression cancer death subject treatment , whichever occur first . Approximately 140 subject randomize 70 receive octreotide 70 receive Octreotide</brief_summary>
