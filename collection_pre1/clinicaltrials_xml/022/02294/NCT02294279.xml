	<brief_summary>Nitric Oxide recognize biological marker many chronic airway disease . It standardise clinical use indicate airway inflammation . In clinical practice , FeNO aid confirmation asthma diagnosis indicate degree steroid-responsiveness . This help guide physician decision initiation inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy , adjustment ICS therapy . Therefore , FeNO measurement could particularly useful confirm asthma diagnosis patient non-specific respiratory symptom ( ≥ 6 week cough and/or wheeze and/or chronic dyspnoea ) ass likely benefit corticosteroid treatment . This study assess suitability FeNO predict ICS responsiveness patient non-specific respiratory symptom . Additionally , would like determine suitability FeNO diagnostic tool asthma comparison conventional predictor , e.g . spirometry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation FeNO Predicting Response ICS Subjects With Non-specific Respiratory Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial plan enrolment 264 patient UK Singapore . Eligible patient 18-80 year old ≥6 week ' duration non-specific respiratory symptom define cough and/or wheeze and/or dyspnoea . Patients FEV1 &lt; 90 % predict visit 1 must show reversibility &lt; 20 % visit 1 within prior year . Key exclusion criterion prior diagnosis asthma ; evidence concomitant chronic respiratory disease , respiratory tract infection ; know significant risk factor cough wheeze . Baseline assessment include spirometry ( FEV1 , force vital capacity ) FeNO measurement . Patients provide peak flow meter twice daily measurement throughout study . At 2 week , clinical assessment spirometry perform confirm eligibility , patient complete four validated questionnaire assess quality life , asthma control , asthma symptom , include visual analog scale bother asthma symptom . Eligible patient stratify baseline FeNO level ( normal ≤25 , intermediate &gt; 25 ≤50 , high &gt; 50 ppb ) ; group randomise receive beclometasone 400 mcg daily placebo 6 week . An optional blood sample collect consent patient assess blood eosinophil . At visit 3 , final assessment include spirometry , FeNO measurement , questionnaire . Interaction analysis use determine whether differential effect exist response ICS FeNO group .</detailed_description>

Accepted method contraception include : intrauterine device ( IUD ) , systemic contraception e.g . steroidal contraceptive ( oral , implanted transdermal inject ) , barrier method spermicide , partner vasectomy The patient ever diagnose asthma evidence UK quality outcome framework approve Read code well reversibility ≥ 20 % predict The patient receive oral , inhaled systemic corticosteroid , leukotriene modifier longactingbetaagonist within four week prior visit 1 . All therapy treatment outline permit study The patient significant chronic respiratory disorder asthma , e.g . COPD ( fix obstruction , postbronchodilator ) cystic fibrosis , severe untreated bronchiectasis interstitial lung disease The patient significant medical condition would make unlikely patient complete study The patient know significant risk factor cough wheeze , include limited : take ACE inhibitor , severe untreated rhinitis , significant gastroesophageal reflux disease The patient asymptomatic ( ACQ &lt; 1 ) initial 2week assessment The patient respiratory tract infection judge clinically , within four week prior visit 1 , display acute respiratory tract infection time study The patient pregnant woman intend get pregnant ( Any woman become pregnant study withdrawn study )</criteria>
