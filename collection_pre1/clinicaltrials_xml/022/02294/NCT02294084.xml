	<brief_summary>The obesity epidemic result exponential increase obesity-related disorder include type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia cardiovascular disease . The associated morbidity mortality major consequence individual well socioeconomical level . Thus , development novel therapy aim reduce development obesity highly warrant . Brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) recently emerge novel player energy expenditure human combusts fatty acid towards heat . Interestingly , obese subject less BAT compare lean subject activation BAT mean intermittent cold exposure reduces fat mass . Therefore , BAT consider promising novel target reduce obesity associate disorder . As cold exposure desire therapeutic strategy human , current pre-clinical research focus pharmacological activation BAT . Interestingly , investigator recently show central agonism receptor incretin hormone glucacon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) result activation BAT mouse . One currently use anti-diabetic drug enhance GLP-1 availability Sitagliptin ( STG ) . Interestingly , STG also reduce body weight plasma triglyceride ( TG ) level type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patient . The mechanism underlie beneficial metabolic effect currently unknown . The investigator hypothesize STG enhances BAT activation , thereby increase energy expenditure combustion TG-derived fatty acid , result lower plasma TG level body weight . To end , investigator perform randomize double-blinded placebo-controlled study 30 male Dutch Caucasian adult age 35-50 year moderate obesity pre-diabetes include . Subjects treat 12 week STG placebo . Before treatment , investigator determine BAT volume total BAT activity via cold-induced 18F-FDG PET-CT scan , rest energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry use ventilate hood , body weight , body composition via DEXA scan . Furthermore , treatment , blood sample take measure plasma lipid , glucose insulin level . This study offer valuable novel insight effect pharmacological activation BAT human obese subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In current study , effect 12 week STG treatment ( 100 mg/day p.o . ) versus placebo study moderately obese pre-diabetic Dutch Caucasians male ( 35-50 year ) . All study subject screen subject meet inclusion criterion , willing participate study sign informed consent , include . All subject ask make change usual diet physical activity start whole study . Subjects undergo two study day ( day 1 day 2 ) STG placebo treatment two study day treatment ( day 84 day 85 ) cold-induced PET-CT scan well metabolic study skeletal muscle biopsy perform . At screen thorough medical history ( see Appendix D ) physical examination perform . Subjects examine fast state . Anthropometric measurement perform well basal blood sample take mean venapunction . Basal blood measurement include hematology kidney , liver , thyroid lipid parameter well glucose , C-peptide insulin concentration . Thereafter , subject ingest 75 gram glucose orally ( t=0 ) t=120 minute blood sample determination glucose , C-peptide insulin drawn ( venapunction ) ass glucose tolerance . On study day 1 84 , take place dept . Nuclear Medicine Rijnland hospital , anthropometric measurement perform first , follow ingestion CoreTemp Pill core temperature registration application , DEXA scan , application wireless iButtons monitor skin temperature . Next , subject lay bed two water-perfused matrasses water temperature set 32Â°C ( = thermoneutrality ) . After 30 min thermoneutrality , rest energy expenditure ( REE ) measure via ventilate hood . Then , thermoneutral venous blood sample obtain . Water temperature gradually decrease stabilized shiver level induce maximum non-shivering thermogenesis ( NST ) next two hour . During cool period , blood pressure , heart rate shivering monitor fixed interval . At t=60 min , one hour stable cooling , 110 MBq ( 2.09 mSv ) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) inject . At t=90 min , REE measure . At t=120 min , cold-induced venous blood sample obtain followed performance PET-CT scan ( see Appendix B overview study day 1 84 ) . On study day 2 85 , perform research laboratory LUMC , muscle biopsy take first . Then , 1 hour rest , OGTT perform . To end , glucose drink contain 75 g glucose ingest maximum 5 minute t=-10 , 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 90 120 min venous sample take assess glucose , insulin C-peptide level ( see Appendix C overview study day 2 85 ) . During treatment period , study subject call weekly researcher ask possible side effect , sign hypoglycemia , plasma glucose level ( via finger prick , do study subject ) compliance . Once month , study subject return research laboratory LUMC . During occasion , next above-mentioned parameter , also venous blood sample obtain ( venapunction ) ass plasma glucose , insulin triglyceride level .</detailed_description>
