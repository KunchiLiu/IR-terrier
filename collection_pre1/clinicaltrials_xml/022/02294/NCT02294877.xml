	<detailed_description>MARS multicenter , multinational , observational disease registry patient diagnose Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA ( MPS IVA ) . The Registry collect medical history , clinical safety assessment every six month , 10 year . The Registry enroll collect data patient period least 8 year time first market approval globally data individual patient continue collect least 2 year time last patient enrol Registry complete . These assessment design characterize spectrum clinical sign symptom disease , characterize safety profile Vimizim broad population . It require patient receive Vimizim eligible participate Registry . In addition , Registry collect additional data patient complete MOR-005 MOR-007 clinical trial . The MOR-005 MOR-007 clinical trial patient enrol appropriate Registry Substudy minimum 5 year time patient 's enrollment MOR-005 clinical study MOR-007 clinical study . After 5 year period , patient remain MARS Registry complete .</detailed_description>
