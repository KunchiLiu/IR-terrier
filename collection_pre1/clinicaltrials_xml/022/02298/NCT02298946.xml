	<brief_summary>Background : - T-cells white blood cell find kill germ tumor . Cancer keep T-cells work . Researchers think new drug call AMP-224 might help T-cells people cancer . They think drug might work even well combine certain type radiation therapy . Objective : - To study safety effectiveness AMP-224 together 1 3 day stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) direct liver . Eligibility : - People age 18 old metastatic colorectal cancer . Their cancer must spread liver respond treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . Their tumor measure computerized tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) chest , stomach , pelvis . They electrocardiogram ( ECG ) heart test . - Participants small part tumor remove needle ( biopsy ) . - Participants 8 study visit 10 week . - At 1 visit , another tumor biopsy . - At 1 visit , get chemotherapy drug vein ( IV ) . - At 6 visit , receive AMP-224 IV . - At 1 3 visit , SBRT . CT scan map position tumor . Radiation beam different intensity different angle direct tumor . - At visit , screen procedure may repeat . - After treatment end , participant 7 follow-up visit 5 month . Blood drawn . Some screening procedure may repeat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMP-224 , PD-1 Inhibitor , Combination With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy People With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Colorectal cancer remain second lead cause cancer death western country median survival approximately 24 month despite recent advance systemic treatment . - Several preclinical study document increase peripheral antitumor immunity follow radiation , phenomenon know abscopal effect . Tumor PDL1 expression also show induced radiation , suppress anti-tumor immune response . Inhibition PD-1/PDL-1 axis show improve anti-tumor immunity block tumor-mediated suppression cytotoxic T cell . - AMP-224 , B7-DC Fc fusion protein , bind PD-1 , inhibitory receptor present cell surface exhaust , activate , effector , memory T cell . AMP- 224 unique mechanism action bind specifically PD-1HI T cell ( chronically stimulate / exhaust T cell ) PD-1LO cell represent normal activate T cell population - The aim study evaluate whether anti-tumor immunity anti-PD1 therapy ( AMP-224 ) enhance radiation therapy . Objectives : - To assess safety , tolerability feasibility AMP-224 combination stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Eligibility : - Histologically confirm metastatic colorectal cancer . - Patient must progress intolerant prior oxaliplatin- irinotecancontaining regimen metastatic lesion amenable curative resection . - Patient must one focus metastatic disease liver amenable SBRT . - Patient must least one measurable metastatic lesion RECIST 1.1 criterion outside radiation field . - Patients must willing undergo mandatory pre post treatment tumor biopsy . Design : - This pilot study whereby patient receive SBRT one liver lesion concomitant AMP-224 . A single treatment low dose/cyclophosphamide administer conjunction SBRT therapy prior first AMP-224 treatment . - Hypofractionated radiation administer metastatic disease site dose schedule 8Gy 1 3 day dose level ( DL ) 1 2 respectively . The day first administration AMP-224 designate Day 1 . In DL1 SBRT administer Day 0 . In DL2 SBRT administer D-2 D0 . The study begin DL1 escalate DL2 subject enrol DL1 remain study 4 week , DLT period . - AMP-224 therapy give intravenous infusion begin Day 1 every 14 day total 6 treatment . Optional continuation treatment q2- weekly PD consider respond patient . - Cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 intravenous give Day 0 , prior first dose AMP-224 . - Correlative study : Peripheral blood collect ( pre-dose ) day 1 , 29 , 57 93 immune study ( include immunogenicity , circulate PD plasma sample , immunemonitoring phenotyping PBMC T-cell activation ) . Tumor biopsy ( FFPE + Frozen ) irradiate non-irradiated liver lesion collect day 1 day 29 , analyze immunohistochemistry tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes addition RNA analysis . - PK sample collect Days 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 addition 5 post treatment date ( feasible ) .</detailed_description>
