	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ziv-aflibercept give together pembrolizumab treat patient solid tumor spread place body . Ziv-afibercept work decrease blood nutrient supply tumor , may result shrink tumor . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving ziv-aflibercept together pembrolizumab may better treatment patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Ziv-aflibercept Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability recommend phase II dose combination ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma , renal cell cancer , ovarian cancer , colorectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary estimate progression-free survival 6 month . II . To obtain preliminary estimate rate 1-year overall survival . III . To obtain preliminary estimate response rate . IV . To obtain preliminary estimate time progression . V. To perform pilot assessment positron emission tomography ( PET ) response versus Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) versus immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) criterion . VI . To perform correlative science provide information regard mechanisms action combination treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ziv-aflibercept . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 30 minute ziv-aflibercept IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 12 week .</detailed_description>
