	<detailed_description>Farber disease , also know Farber 's lipogranulomatosis , autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease mark deficiency enzyme ceramidase cause progressive accumulation fatty material lipid lead abnormality joint , liver , throat , tissue central nervous system . Farber disease extremely rare disorder , prevalence less 1/1000000 . Currently 80 case report worldwide . Disease onset typically early infancy may occur later life . It inherit autosomal recessive pattern . The clinical presentation Farber Disease ( FD ) characterize appearance subcutaneous skin nodule , ordinarily near joint , often interphalangeal , wrist , elbow ankle joint , point mechanical pressure . These manifestation painful lead progressive joint stiffness , limitation motion contractures finally immobilization deformation joint . Also , characteristic sign FD development progressive hoarseness due laryngeal involvement . Beside major manifestation seven phenotype describe differ severity additional organ involvement , like lung , nervous system , heart lymph node . Dependent residual lysosomal ceramidase turnover , patient variable degree central nervous system disease , lead progressive neurologic deterioration . In case neuronal dysfunction rather general physical dystrophy seem limit duration FD . As well , patient FD may die due pulmonary disease interstitial pneumonia . First symptoms usually appear newborn period first birthday . Milder form type 3 described onset 20 month age . Clinical manifestation type 5 FD , dominate neurologic deterioration , begin 1 2 1/2 year life . Patients mainly die within first year life , prolonged course patient without severe CNS disease may also observe . Type 1 common classical , form condition associate classic sign voice , skin , joint problem begin month birth . Developmental delay lung disease also commonly occur . Infants born type 1 Farber lipogranulomatosis usually survive early childhood . Types 2 3 generally less severe sign symptom type . Affected individual three classic sign usually developmental delay . Children type Farber lipogranulomatosis typically live mid- late childhood . Types 4 5 associate severe neurological problem . Type 4 usually cause life-threatening health problem begin infancy due massive lipid deposit liver , spleen , lung , immune system tissue . Children type typically survive past first year life . Type 5 characterize progressive decline brain spinal cord ( central nervous system ) function , cause paralysis arm legs ( quadriplegia ) , seizure , loss speech , involuntary muscle jerk ( myoclonus ) , developmental delay . Children type 5 Farber lipogranulomatosis survive early childhood . Types 6 7 rare , affected individual associate disorder addition Farber lipogranulomatosis . Faber lipogranulomatosis cause mutation ASAH1 gene , situate short arm chromosome 8 . This gene cod acid ceramidase , lysosomal heterodimeric enzyme hydrolyzes ceramide sphingosine fatty acid . To date , less 25 distinct mutation identify Farber patient , large deletion yet report . A total 13 different mutation identify include 1 splice , 1 polypyrimidine tract ( PPT ) deletion 11 missense mutation . Eleven mutation exclusive Indian population . In Farber 's Disease , mutation ASAH1 gene lead reduction acid ceramidase 's activity 90 % . Consequently ceramide n't properly break gather lysosome cell various tissue , lung , liver , colon , skeletal muscle , cartilage bone . Certain study inflammatory symptom FD indicate granulomatous inflammation consequence mere ceramide storage reflect dysregulation leukocyte function , probably due intracellular role ceramide intracellular signal transduction . However , sequence molecular mechanism lead defect ceramide metabolism chronic granulomatous inflammation still need elucidation . Alterations receptor-mediated apoptosis ceramide accumulation inflammatory cell may one mechanism underlie abnormal granuloma formation .</detailed_description>
