	<brief_summary>This study evaluate combination BYL719 , cisplatin cetuximab induction chemotherapy prior minimally-invasive transoral surgery ( TORS TLM ) selective lymph node dissection ( SLND ) , follow risk-adapted intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) patient transorally resectable , Stage III-IVa , HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab , Cisplatin BYL719 HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPV status tobacco use major independent prognostic factor patient OPSCC . Patients HPV-associated OPSCC favorable prognosis treat chemotherapy , radiation , and/or surgery . This result national trial investigate de-intensification strategy good-risk patient HPV-associated OPSCC , current multimodality paradigm may represent overtreatment . The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network , mitogenic pathway regulate cellular metabolism , proliferation survival , play major role HPV biology . Starting early infection , activation PI3K suppress autophagy induces functional protein translational machinery . Activation pathway nearly universal aspect mammalian viral infection , particular importance dsDNA viruses HPV . The oncoproteins E5 , E6 E7 also direct role pathway activation . Moreover , HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrate strikingly high prevalence genomic activation PI3K pathway , include activate PIK3CA mutation ( 27-31 % ) , PIK3CA amplification ( 20 % ) , loss PTEN ( 30 % ) , negative regulator PI3K . Overall genomic event hypothesize result PI3K pathway activation present approximately 45-60 % HPV-transformed OPSCC . BYL719 oral , small molecule , alpha-specific inhibitor PI3-Kinase . Because HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrate high rate genomic non-genomic PI3K pathway activation , hypothesize add BYL719 platinum-taxane induction chemotherapy HPV-associated OPSCC increase clinico-radiologic complete response relative historical control . In phase I/II trial , eligible patient wiht HPV-associated OPSCC treat 3 cycle induction BYL719 , cisplatin paclitaxel . Induction follow minimally-invasive , transoral surgery ( TORS TLM ) risk-adapted IMRT .</detailed_description>
