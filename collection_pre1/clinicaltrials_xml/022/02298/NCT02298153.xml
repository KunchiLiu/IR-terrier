	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety tolerability epacadostat ( INCB024360 ) administer combination atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A ) patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) previously treat platinum-based chemotherapy Stage IV urothelial carcinoma fail platinum-based chemotherapy regimen . The study conduct two phase . The dose escalation phase utilize 3 + 3 design identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Pharmacologically Active Dose ( PAD ) combination . This follow dose expansion phase , comprise three cohort . Expansion Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics dose identified phase one . Expansion Cohort 3 evaluate change biomarker expression follow treatment epacadostat monotherapy follow epacadostat atezolizumab administer combination .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female subject , age 18 year old Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC Stage IIIB Stage IV NSCLC candidate multimodality treatment receive least 1 line standard platinumbased therapy : Prior systemic regimen must include least 2 cycle platinumbased therapy may include platinum therapy use radiosensitizer . Maintenance chemotherapy allow . Tumors driver mutation ( epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive ) disease progression intolerant standard tyrosinekinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , include second line TKI therapy available indicate . Subjects initially treat platinum regimen Stage IIIB disease later develop metastatic disease retreat platinum regimen allow . Histologically cytologically confirm urothelial carcinoma . Stage IV locally advance metastatic urothelial carcinoma disease progression follow platinumcontaining chemotherapy disease progression within 12 month neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment platinumcontaining chemotherapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Presence measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Availability adequate archival tumor specimen willingness undergo pretreatment tumor biopsy . Subjects enrolled Expansion Cohort 3 must willing 2 ontreatment tumor biopsy . For male female childbearing potential , willingness use adequate birth control 90 day last dose epacadostat atezolizumab . Laboratory medical history parameter within protocoldefined range . Current treatment investigational study drug immunologicalbased agent reason , receipt anticancer medication within 21 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) first dose .
