	<detailed_description>This two-arm , randomized-controlled pilot study 2 year duration . The `` intervention '' refers surveillance base EAU guideline `` control '' refers surveillance base AUA guideline . Research method : Participants present non-muscle invasive bladder cancer meet inclusion/exclusion criterion give option participate study .

Non-local site include University Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) . The research procedures consist urine collection , cystoscopy , patient satisfaction cost questionnaire . The evaluation do tumor recurrence progression disease . At various time point throughout study , urine may obtain patient bank Genitourinary ( GU ) Tissue Bank . Subjects ask provide urine sample ( ) ask sign separate inform consent . The urine de-identified lab per Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) protocol GU Tissue Bank Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) # 20050234H ) . Patients undergo cystoscopy clinic ( standard care ) . In intervention arm , patient surveillance cystoscopy perform 3 , 12 month 24 month follow diagnosis bladder cancer . Patients randomize control arm , undergo surveillance cystoscopy every 3 month 2 year follow diagnosis bladder cancer . Because use cytology variable among participate urologist , utilization cytology treat urologist 's discretion per usual standard care . Study duration 2 year recent biopsy . Patients place surveillance schedule base length time last tumor .</detailed_description>
