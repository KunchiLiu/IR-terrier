In intervention arm facility , health worker see take care patient outpatient department ( OPD ) register receive automated SMS intervention study . During evaluation phase , patient attend survey facility initial illness consultation eligible inclusion study . Assessment adherence perform malaria patient ( test positive ) receive ACT treatment . Due logistical difficulty , health facility within Delta region exclude study . As well , two hospital district exclude study since mostly receive referral patient . Also , hospital specialize clinic section highly trained staff nurse clinician may rotate different department , hence may health provider 's whose primary duty OPD patient alone . In addition , health worker eligible facility mobile phone exclude receive `` SMS '' reminder . During evaluation , severe case hospitalize patient include survey .
