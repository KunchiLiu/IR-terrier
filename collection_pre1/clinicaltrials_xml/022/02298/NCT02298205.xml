	<brief_summary>African American ( AA ) child carry disproportionate burden mortality morbidity asthma . A major contributor racial disparity asthma lack adherence guideline-recommended use daily inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) . Symptom-based adjustment ( SBA ) ICS recently describe patient-centered approach asthma therapy patient adjust ICS day-to-day basis guide symptom . The overall goal study identify acceptable , pragmatic effective approach asthma management high-risk AA child . Our primary hypothesis SBA ICS use acceptable provider-based adjustment ( PBA ) , equally effective improve pediatric asthma outcome , reduce cumulative dose ICS need asthma control . Therefore , Asthma Symptom base adjustment Inhaled Steroid Therapy African American child ( ASIST ) study , propose randomize , open-label , 2-arm , parallel , pragmatic trial randomly assign 200 AA child either receive SBA PBA 12 month . The primary outcome asthma control measure Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . We propose asthma control SBA group equivalent PBA group 12 month . Secondary outcome include monthly cumulative ICS dose , exacerbation rate , quality life , lung function , adherence satisfaction treatment plan .</brief_summary>
