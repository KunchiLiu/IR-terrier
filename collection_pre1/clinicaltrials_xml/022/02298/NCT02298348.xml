	<brief_title>Sorafenib Cyclophosphamide/Topotecan Patients With Relapsed Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study combine three drug : sorafenib , cyclophosphamide topotecan . This study involve use experimental drug , call sorafenib . Sorafenib block function protein important growth cancer cell . This drug test ( single-agent ) child relapse solid tumor , include patient neuroblastoma . In laboratory , sorafenib appear make neuroblastoma tumor small , addition help immune cell active attack tumor block harmful immune cell promote tumor growth function . Sorafenib also help block tumor cell develop blood vessel use `` feed '' tumor . Sorafenib FDA-approved drug currently widely use adult specific type liver kidney cancer . Cyclophosphamide topotecan FDA-approved chemotherapy drug . These drug approve treatment certain adult cancer , also use treat child cancer . These drug use combination many people neuroblastoma . In neuroblastoma patient , combination reduce amount tumor burden . Adding sorafenib cyclophosphamide topotecan may increase effectiveness combination . The investigator first need find high dose sorafenib give safely together cyclophosphamide topotecan . This first study test give three drug together help determine high dose sorafenib safely give together cyclophosphamide topotecan patient resistant/relapsed neuroblastoma .</detailed_description>
