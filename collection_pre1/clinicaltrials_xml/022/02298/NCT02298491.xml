	<brief_summary>The purpose study see treatment H.P . Acthar® Gel result improvement long-term stabilization clinical radiographic abnormality occur patient CNS sarcoidosis . In addition , also look whether treatment also associate improvement measure quality life . The treatment CNS sarcoidosis involve use either corticosteroid prednisone potent immunosuppressive agent methotrexate , induce severe long term side effect . The adverse effect steroid may avoid treatment adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , available patient use H.P . Acthar® Gel . The efficacy H.P . Acthar® Gel treatment CNS sarcoidosis impact quality life previously study . In addition , little known regard expression immune marker CNS sarcoidosis association marker disease activity response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis chronic frequently progressive systemic disease affect central nervous system ( CNS ) approximately 5 % patient . The hallmark disease development chronic inflammation formation non-caseating granuloma involve brain parenchyma meninges appear contrast-enhancing mass lesion magnetic resonance imaging . The granulomas primarily comprise proinflammatory T cell ( Th1 cell Th17 cell ) macrophage accumulate early stage granuloma formation . The inflammation generate cell modulate anti-inflammatory response mediate Th2 cell regulatory T ( Treg ) cell later appear populate outer region granuloma . The presence Treg cell particular interest since cell also detect high number peripheral blood immune suppression result may underlie occurrence anergy patient disease . The treatment CNS sarcoidosis involve use either corticosteroid potent immunosuppressive agent , induce severe long-term side effect . The adverse effect steroid may avoid treatment adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , available patient use H.P . Acthar® Gel . The efficacy H.P . Acthar® Gel treatment CNS sarcoidosis impact quality life previously examine . In addition , little known regard expression immune marker CNS sarcoidosis association marker disease activity response treatment . These issue , therefore , explore context proposal .</detailed_description>
