	<brief_summary>The main trial double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomize , phase III , multi-center trial adult patient relapse refractory AML harbor activate FLT3 mutation define inclusion /exclusion criterion . An initial open label dose-finding run-in phase I study perform administer study drug crenolanib salvage chemotherapy consist mitoxantrone cytarabine ( MC ) 18 patient accord experimental arm study . After completion dose-finding run-in phase I , toxicity response data provide external Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) Trial Committee Coordinating Investigator . The Trial Committee decide basis data recommendation DSMB dose modification conduct study regard double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized phase study . The double-blinded , placebo-controlled randomize portion start completion dose-finding run-in phase I positive opinion Trial Committee . Crenolanib start day 7 MC give continuously 48 hour prior next chemotherapy ; receive allogeneic HCT , crenolanib hold 48 hour prior condition restarts sooner 30 day later day 100 transplant . Sample size randomize phase : 276 patient Primary objective : To evaluate impact crenolanib give combination salvage chemotherapy consolidation include allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ongoing single agent maintenance therapy crenolanib event-free ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) adult patient relapse refractory AML harbor FLT3 activate mutation .</brief_summary>
