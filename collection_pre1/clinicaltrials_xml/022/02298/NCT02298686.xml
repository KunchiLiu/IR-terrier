	<detailed_description>The Mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS Disorders ) group rare genetic disorder cause deficiency one lysosomal enzyme , result inability metabolize complex carbohydrate ( mucopolysaccharide ) simpler molecule . High concentration mucopolysaccharide cell central nervous system , include brain , cause neurological developmental deficit accompany disorder . Lysosomal enzymes find lysosome , small membrane-contained body ( or-ganelle ) find cytoplasm cell . The lysosome often call `` waste dis-posal plant '' cell . The accumulation large , undegraded mucopolysaccharide cell body cause number physical symptom abnormality . MPS-III ( Sanfilippo Syndrome ) one seven MPS Disorders . It inborn error metab-olism transmit autosomal recessive genetic disorder . MPS-lll cate-gorized four subtypes : MPS-III Type A , MPS-III Type B , MPS-III Type C , MPS-III Type D depend gene defect ( MPS3A - SGSH gene , MPS3B - NAGLU gene , MPS3C - HGSNAT , MPS3D - GNS gene ) . All type associate degree mental deterioration , severity depend particular type MPS-lll . Several phys-ical defect may present , severity defect varies type MPS-III . In case type MPS-III , abnormal amount specific , chemically complex molecule excrete urine . The excreted chemical four type MPS-III , since defective gene involve different step , thus different en-zyme , deconstruction mucopolysaccharide . By test one another enzyme , variant type may readily identify . Symptoms Patients Sanfilippo Syndrome ( MPS Type III ) usually appear normal birth , mental retardation developmental delay usually evident age 3-5 year . Mental motor development reach peak 3-6 year age behavioral disturbance intellectual decline usually occur . However , hyperactivity irritability may become obvious earlier . The following symptom usually apparent approximately age 10 : neurological deficit sign , wobbly erratic gait difficulty walk ( ataxia ) , hyperactivity ( hyperkinetic syndrome ) , mental retardation , stiff joint , hernia , enlarge liver and/or spleen ( hepatosple-nomegaly ) .Growth usually minimally affect ; head may enlarge , abnormal hairiness ( hirsutism ) may occur . Mild coarsen facial feature also characterize disorder . In case deafness may also occur . All four variety MPS-III autosomal recessive genetic disorder . The gene abnormality associate MSS-IIIA , MPS-IIIB , MPS-IIIC MPS-IIID identify . Genetic disease determine combination gene particular trait chromosome receive father mother . Recessive genetic disorder occur individual inherits abnormal gene trait parent . If individual receive one normal gene one gene disease , person carrier disease , usually show symptom . The risk two carrier parent pass defective gene , therefore , af-fected child 25 % pregnancy . The risk child carrier like parent 50 % pregnancy . The chance child receive normal gene parent genetically normal particular trait 25 % . The risk male female . All individual carry 4-5 abnormal gene . Parents close relative ( consanguineous ) high chance unrelated parent carry abnormal gene , increase risk child recessive genetic disorder .</detailed_description>
