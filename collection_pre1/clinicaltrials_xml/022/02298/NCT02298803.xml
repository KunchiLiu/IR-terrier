	<brief_title>QT Interval Abnormalities Sulfonylurea Treated Type 2 Diabetes : Relationship Treatment Induced Hypoglycaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Scientific Basis : Hypoglycaemia common acute complication diabetes limit therapeutic effort improve glycaemic control . It potential side effect drug use treat diabetes , particularly use exogenous insulin insulin secretagogues , sulfonylurea ( SU ) treatment . As many people prescribed agent , hypoglycaemia frequent clinical practice , particularly treatment target become stringent . Several study demonstrate insulin-induced hypoglycaemia cause prolongation correct QT ( QTc ) interal ( Chugh et al ) , associate ventricular arrhythmia sudden death , perhaps result hypokalaemia increase serum catecholamine . Cardiac effect hypoglycaemia usually associate type 1 diabetes insulin therapy . Hypoglycaemia type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) oral agent , recently , consider serious . Recently , hypoglycaemia T2Dm come focus since salutary result ACCORD , ADVANCE VADT trail , implicate hypoglycaemia cause increase death . The majority excess death intensive treatment group ACCORD classify sudden cardiac death . There grow body evidence hypoglycaemia pro-arrhythmic event via QT prolongation particularly context myocardial ischemia reduces tolerance myocardial tissue pro-arrhythmic action hypoglycaemia . It notable hypoglycaemia occur commonly use SU . For example UK Hypoglycaemia Study ( UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group ) , 7 % individual treat SUs least one episode severe ( require external assistance ) hypoglycaemia proportion report least one mild ( symptomatic , self-treated ) episode 39 % , rate comparable insulin treatment . Furthermore , SU receptor function regulatory subunit adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -sensitive potassium ( KATP ) channel . KATP channel widely express heart vascular smooth muscle cell . There long-held concern SU effect channel may affect ischaemic preconditioning ( Cleveland et al ) , protective mechanism myocardium . This may represent additive deleterious impact specific SUs hypoglycaemic setting . Despite theoretical concern associate SU treatment pro-arrhythmic effect SU induce hypoglycaemia previously easy study ambulatory patient . Now dual ambulatory technology CGMS ( Maia et al ) ambulatory ECG ( Holter ) monitoring provide opportunity examine potential association real life condition . Even absence absolute QT prolongation , evidence beat-to-beat QT variability also risk marker sudden death ventricular arrhythmia ( Piccirillo et al ) . Additionally , glucose variability may also impact cardiac tissue . Habituation chronic hyperglycaemia could lead situation sudden decrease plasma glucose lead change QT interval , even glucose fall within normal range ( `` relative hypoglycaemia '' ) . A pilot study institution 14 individual insulin ( 3 T1DM 11 T2DM ) show statistically significant prolongation QTc period hypoglycaemia . The mean difference QTc hypos 7.8ms ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . An inverse relationship magnitude increase QTs hypoglycaemia baseline QTc find . The limitation pilot study restrict subject treat insulin relative hypoglycaemia QT variability analyse . Hypothesis : Sulfonylurea induce hypoglycaemia and/or fluctuation glucose pro-arrhythmic prolonging QTc interval and/or increase beat-to-beat QTc variability . It expect QT interval significantly longer hypoglycemic period compare non-hypoglycemic period patient T2DM treat SU . Aims : To examine association hypoglycaemia glucose fluctuation QT-interval QT variability patient type 2 diabetes treat SU . Patients study use simultaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) ambulatory ECG monitoring ( Holter ) . Potential Significance : The information gain study potential improve understand relationship hypoglycaemia cardiac arrhythmia patient diabetes . Recruitment Process : Patients type 2 diabetes attend Diabetes Centre , Royal Prince Alfred Hospital fulfil entry criterion approach participate study . They approach either attend Diabetes Centre treatment , mean telephone call . The requirement study discuss potential participant give copy Participant Information Sheet Consent Form take home read . The propose number participant study approximately 30 individual . Research Interventions : 1 . Blood Collection 2 . Continuous Glucose Monitoring 3 . Home Blood Glucose Monitoring 4 . Holter Monitor Risk Side Effects : We anticipate adverse event associate study participation . However , may mild discomfort and/or bruise site blood collection , insertion glucose sensor CGM , skin irritation ECG adhesive tape require Holter monitoring .</detailed_description>
