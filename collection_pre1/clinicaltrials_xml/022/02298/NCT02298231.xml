	<brief_title>Improving Balance TBI Using Virtual Reality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic Brain injury ( TBI ) major health concern U.S. military civilian population , result 5.3 million people require rehabilitation assistance short long-term consequence TBI . TBI impairs integration organization visual , auditory somatosensory input permit body position awareness , relation self environment . Even minor impairment system cause balance dysfunction ( BDF ) , one disabling aspects TBI . BDF affect 65 % individual TBI . When cognitive deficit present , BDF may become pronounced , particularly attempt engage one task time ( i.e. , dual task ) . Treating BDF patient TBI challenging , traditional treatment consistently replicate everyday life environment . Virtual reality ( VR ) intervention enable clinician systematically deliver control dynamic , interactive , multisensory stimulus . The propose study implement evaluate novel , low-cost , VR rehabilitation tool ( Mystic Isle ; MI ) target somatosensory , vestibular , vision system double-blind RCT . Given importance dual-task skill real-world functioning , investigator also evaluate relative effectiveness dual task ( balance cognitive ) VR train improve balance . Preliminary case , feasibility efficacy study conduct use MI rehabilitation population . Findings demonstrate customize VR use full-body movement track motivating , feasible balance training neurorehabilitation population , result improve balance motor action planning . The propose study directly evaluate effectiveness low-cost , interactive , multisensory , VR train use MI improve balance global functioning . The investigator evaluate relative effectiveness dual task ( balance cognitive ) VR train improve balance , long-term effectiveness training , utility balance maintenance program facilitate longer-term treatment effect . A total 180 participant ( Service Members , Veterans , civilian ) mild severe TBI document balance impairment randomly assign one three balance treatment group : 1 ) Standard care ( control condition ) ; 2 ) MI ; 3 ) MI dual task ( balance plus cognitive ) . All group undergo 2 treatment sessions/week x 6 week ( i.e . 12 session ) . Following completion treatment protocol , participant MI train group randomly assign maintenance training group ( 2 sessions/month x 4 month ) non-maintenance group . All participant undergo baseline , immediate ( 6 week ) , long-term ( 4 month ) follow-up assessment : 1 ) static dynamic balance 2 ) community integration , self-efficacy , quality life , cognitive function . This design allow u assess efficacy MI customizable balance treatment TBI , evaluate impact remediation program overall functioning . The following hypothesis propose : 1 ) Participants complete MI training condition exhibit significantly improve balance relative control group ; 2 ) Participants complete MI training condition demonstrate significantly great improvement global functioning relative control group ; 3 ) Participants receive MI dual task training ( balance cognitive ) exhibit significantly great improvement balance relative single task MI training ; 4 ) Participants complete MI training condition sustain treatment gain 4 month follow treatment relative baseline performance ; control group maintain decrease balance follow-up session ; 5 ) Participants receive maintenance training maintain good balance 4 month follow-up period compare non-maintenance group . The propose study poise make important contribution enhance balance function service member civilians TBI , thereby promote recovery physical social function overall quality life .</detailed_description>

Balance dysfunction determine impairment stand balance measure ( Sensory Organization Test ) Be able willing comply study procedure , include followup requirement . Be willing able give inform consent Have unstable uncontrolled seizure disorder . Have diagnosis excessive fluid surround brain . Have severe cardiac disease ( e.g . heart attack heart failure ) . Have uncontrolled unstable orthostatic hypotension ( blood pressure drop suddenly one stand , cause one feel light head dizzy ) . Have low limb injury past 90 day . Have injury affect one 's ability balance . Have preexist condition significantly affect one 's alignment function one 's low limb standing . Be medication may affect one 's balance , strength , muscle coordination ( e.g . Botox , Baclofen ) . Have significant neurological history ( e.g.epilepsy begin TBI , multiple sclerosis ) TBI . Have significant psychiatric history ( i.e . schizophrenia ) . Have history significant drug abuse . Have physical occupational therapy treatment balance disorder past 30 day . Have difficulty follow respond command would limit study participation . Be currently enrol another research study likely affect participation research study . Have underlie medical condition would limit study participation .</criteria>
