	<detailed_description>Patients centre ( Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , University Hospital Crosshouse NHS Foundation Trust , Barts Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust , East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust , Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Maidstone Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust ) undergo maximal CPET prior major colorectal surgery ( defined procedure involve bowel resection +/- anastomosis stoma ) accord CPET protocol define Appendix 1 . If CPET deviate protocol , centre would need clear local CPET protocol Principle Investigator ( PI ) . All variable measure CPET collect outline Appendix 2 . Following CPET , patient undergo major colorectal surgical procedure . Following surgery routine clinically relevant observational data collect . These data relate hospital length stay , level care require follow surgery , post-operative morbidity ( Postoperative Morbidity Survey - POMS Clavine Dindo Score ) recovery process . Most information access prospectively maintain enhanced recovery database , however patient note electronic patient record acceptable alternative . Appendix 2 show minimum dataset collect . All data individual hospital anonymized source PI send CPET variable , post-operative outcome data , basic patient demographic ( outline Appendix 2 ) link back original patient . We aim include patient age &gt; 18 year consider major colorectal surgery ( benign malignant ) undergoing enhanced recovery programme surgery . Patients exclude diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease , patient schedule neoadjuvant cancer therapy , patient physically unable perform CPET cycle ergometer , patient surgery perform interim emergency surgery , patient lack complete in-hospital morbidity data . All patient receive information sheet regard CPET write consent CPET part routine care obtain centre . Hypothesis This study test hypothesis CPET variable related short-term in-hospital morbidity patient undergo major colorectal surgery . Our primary aim establish reliable relationship post-operative complication ( present absent ) oxygen uptake ( Vo2 ) estimate lactate threshold ( LT ) ; secondary aim explore multivariable relationship CPET variables important prognostic variable post-operative complication attempt risk stratify patient major surgery . Statistical method Non-parametric receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve construct Vo2 LT , Vo2 Peak , O2 Pulse LT ventilatory equivalent carbon dioxide ( VE/ co2 LT ) order assess independent ability discriminate patient without post-operative morbidity . Optimal cut-points obtain minimise distance point ROC curve upper leave corner . Six variable ( satisfy 10 event per variable rule ( 26 ) ) identify candidate multivariable logistic regression model : Vo2 LT Peak , gender , operation type ( laparoscopic/open ) , O2 Pulse LT VE/ co2 LT. A final multivariable model obtain use forward stepwise selection ( minimise Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC ) ) . Its sensitivity variable exclusion re-inclusion also assess use AIC . Model fit assess use Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test . In order explore univariate relationship CPET variables length stay , continuous CPET variable dichotomise optimal cut-point ROC curve Kaplan-Meier curve construct . The log rank test use compare survival curve ; patient die discharge treat right-censored . Patients discharge day 5 exclude analysis length stay . All analysis conduct use Stata ( StataCorp . 2011 Stata Statistical Software : Release 12 . College Station , TX : StataCorp LP. ) . Continuous variable report mean standard deviation ( SD ) median inter-quartile range ( IQR ) depend distribution . Categorical variable present frequency ( percentage ) . P-values obtain use univariate logistic regression ( continuous ) Chi-squared Fisher 's Exact test ( categorical ) . Statistical significance take 5 % . We aim recruit 500 patient undergo CPET , elective colorectal surgery post-operative follow-up . For hypothesised AUROC 0.63 , base previous study , 500 patient would require demonstrate Vo2 LT good chance discriminate patient without post-operative morbidity . This estimate base 5-day morbidity incidence 48 % , 90 % power two-tailed 5 % significance level . The calculated sample size base need evaluate area ROC curve ( AUROC ) . Appendix 1 Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFT 's ) The patient perform pulmonary function test ( breathe test ) . The breathing test perform CPET . Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing A symptom limit CPET perform part patient routine care occur surgery . Specifically , involve cycle exercise bike 8-12 minute . Starting low resistance pedal patient pedal 60 revolution per minute . After 3 minute cycle , resistance gradually increase constant rate patient longer turn pedal require speed . The patient 's heart monitor electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The patient wear soft rubber mask order continuously sample expired air online breath breath gas analyser . This test common practice prior operation provide accurate measure physical capacity centre involve data pool similar CPET protocol describe . Each CPET appointment last approximately one hour , however always part routine car . BORG score assess interval per local policy . CPET follow American Thoracic Society/ American College Chest Physicians recommendation ( 27 ) . Ventilation gas exchange variable measure use metabolic cart . Pulse , 12-lead ECG , blood pressure pulse oximetry monitor throughout . Ramp gradient set 10-25 W/min base calculation ( 28 ) use predict freewheel oxygen uptake ( o2 ) , predict o2 peak exercise , height age . Any major adverse clinical event occur CPET document . Measurements Patient characteristic record per Appendix 2 . Resting flow-volume loop use derive Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) . Ventilation gas exchange variable derive CPET include Vo2 , ventilatory equivalent oxygen carbon dioxide ( VE/ o2 ; VE/ co2 ) oxygen pulse ( o2/heart rate ) , measure LT peak exercise ( 28 ) . LT estimate conventionally ( breakpoint co2- o2 relationship ( 29 ) , increase VE/ o2 end tidal ( PET ) O2 increase VE/ co2 decrease PET co2 ( 30 ) . Peak Vo2 average last 30 second exercise . CPETs report experienced assessor usually experience exercise physiologist consultant anaesthetist . Appendix 2 Short-term surgical outcome assess morbidity ( medical nursing staff blind CPET data ) use 9 domain list Post-Operative Morbidity Survey ( 31 ) day 3,5,7 14 well Clavien-Dindo Classification ( 32 ) ( high grade serious sustain in-hospital complication ) in-hospital mortality . Length hospital stay ( day ) record . All patient usually follow 30 day post-discharge re-admission mortality however essential . All information collect follow surgery carry observation .
