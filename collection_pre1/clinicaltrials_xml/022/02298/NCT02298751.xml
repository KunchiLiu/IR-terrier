	<brief_summary>Background : It well documented individual Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) respond well evidence-based psychological treatment , also large proportion relapse discharge treatment confront alcohol real life . Cue Exposure Therapy ( CET ) focus confront alcohol cue order reduce craving well likelihood relapse . The aim study investigate whether CET aftercare increase efficiency Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) among AUD individual . Design method : The study implement investigator-blinded randomized control trial . A total 300 consecutively enrolled AUD patient , recruit alcohol outpatient clinic randomize one three follow aftercare treatment group : ( A ) CET smartphone application ( n = 100 ) ; ( B ) CET group therapy ( n = 100 ) , ( C ) Aftercare Usual ( n = 100 ) . It hypothesize two experimental group ( ( A ) ( B ) ) achieve well treatment outcome compare control group ( ( C ) ) , It explore whether CET smartphone application effective CET group therapy . The group compare number parameter include alcohol intake , craving copings-strategies . Discussion : If hypothesis , CET increase efficiency CBT verify , make sense supplement CBT CET aftercare , hence , reintegrate CET within CBT approach . Although , CET often regard one behavioral method CBT , appear segregation empirical literature come treatment addictive disorder . However , CET may allow patient practice gain control alcohol cue reactivity associate high-risk situation inter-mediating therapeutic context patient inevitably confront . In way , one might expect transition treatment daily life less overwhelming CET may help prevent relapse long term . Thus , CET may particularly suitable aftercare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND It well documented individual Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUD ) respond well Cognitive Behavioural Therapy , large proportion individual relapse treatment confront alcohol real life . Therefore , future treatment intervention long-term prevention relapse aim teach apply cop strategy regain control alcohol craving daily confrontation alcohol associate stimulus . Cue Exposure Treatment ( CET ) behavioural psychological approach focus confront alcohol cue order reduce craving well likelihood relapse . During CET individual expose alcohol related stimulus whilst usual drink response hinder . Thus , give opportunity practice cop strategy exposure alcohol . In way , predict individual 's learn automatic response extinguish time cognitive control cue reactivity strengthen . Mental health care application , potential improve alcohol treatment continue care offer psychological treatment anywhere patient find convenient . Because , psychological treatment substantial socio-economic burden deliver individual session , tendency deliver relevant treatment group session . However , mental healthcare application , even potential order reduce burden health care system , addition increase availability evidence-based treatment . Whilst group session document effective , behavioural healthcare application target AUD need exploration . OBJECTIVES The objective study three-fold : 1 . To investigate whether manual-based CET deliver via smartphone group session increase efficiency CBT outpatient treatment group AUD individual . 2 . To investigate whether CET smartphone application effective CET group therapy . 3 . To investigate whether CET smartphone intervention show cost-effective CET deliver group session . DESIGN AND METHODS The study implement investigator-blinded , randomize control trial . A total 300 consecutively enrolled AUD individual , recruit alcohol outpatient clinic randomize one three follow aftercare treatment group : ( 1 ) CET smartphone application ; ( 2 ) CET group therapy , ( 3 ) Standard aftercare treatment . Individuals group 1 require use smartphone application five time week eight week . Individuals group 2 require CET group therapy every week eight week . Individuals group 3 receive one individual follow-up session eight week primary treatment end . It hypothesize priori two experimental group achieve good treatment outcome compare control group ( 3 ) . No priori hypothesis guide comparison effect CET deliver via group session smartphone application . Two-sided analysis conduct , empirical literature specific area generate priori hypothesis . The group compare pre- post-aftercare treatment , accord follow parameter : 1 . Relapse alcohol intake , measure Time-Line-Follow-Back ( TLFB ) method ; 2 . Cravings , measure Desires Alcohol Questionnaire ( DAQ ) , Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale ( OCDS ) , Visual Analogue Scale Craving ( VAS ) ; 3 . Coping skill , operationalized Urge-Specific Strategies Questionnaire ( USS ) Data collect three different time-points : enter aftercare treatment ( baseline ) , eight week ( follow-up ) , six month ( follow-up ) . In addition , follow patient medical register one year order measure relapse long term , without challenge associate get contact one year end treatment . 4 . Data register : The National Patient Register , The National Health Service Register , The National Prescription Registry The Psychiatric Central Research Register . Intention-to-treat analysis ( ITT ) carry outpatient . With regard incomplete data , `` last observation carry forward '' ( LOCF ) multiple imputation use . Completer ( on-treatment ) analysis carry patient complete respective intervention . Odense Patient data Explorative Network ( OPEN ) data manager develop electronic scheme data entry . Data import stored OPEN Projects .</detailed_description>
