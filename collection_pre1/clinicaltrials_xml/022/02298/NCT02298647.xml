	<detailed_description>Gangliosides complex compunds consist glycosphingolipid sialic acid locate cell surface responsible detect extracellular mole-cules . Gangliosides mainly locate nervous system . If gangliosides accumulate pathologically throughout body know gangliosidoss . There two main sub-types gangliosidosis depend deficient enzyme , know GM1 GM2 . GM1-Gangliosidosis GM1 gangliosidosis autosomal recessive disease . Genetic counsel pro-vided affected family . The disorder cause mutation GLB1-gene cod beta-galactosidase . To day , 165 mutation identify . Deficient enzyme activity lead toxic accumulation gangliosides body tissue , particularly central nervous system ( CNS ) . The disorder panethnic however worldwide prevalence know . Prevalence birth estimate approximately 1:100,000 200,000 live birth . High prevalence find Malta Brazil , Cypriot Roma population . Deficiency lysosomal hydrolase , acid β-galactosidase , cause GM1.Three clinical sub-types GM1 gangliosidosis recognize , classify age onset , follow : - Infantile ( type 1 ) : In common infantile form , coarse facial feature , hepato-splenomegaly , generalized skeletal dysplasia ( dysostosis multiplex ) , macular cherry-red spot , developmental delay/arrest ( follow progressive neurologic deteri-oration ) usually occur within first 6 month life . Nonimmune hydrops fetalis report . An increased incidence Mongolian spot also describe . A wide spectrum variability observe appearance progression typical dysmorphic feature . As many 50 % affected infant macular cherry-red spot . - Juvenile ( type 2 ) : The juvenile form characterize later age onset , less hepatosplenomegaly ( ) , few cherry-red spot ( ) , dysmorphic feature , skeletal change ( vertebral dysplasia may detect radiographically ) . - Adult ( type 3 ) : The adult form characterize normal early neurologic develop-ment , variable age clinical presentation . Slowly progress dementia parkinsonian feature extrapyramidal disease common . Intellectual impairment may initially absent mild progress time . Generalized dystonia speech gait disturbance frequently report early feature . Typically , hepatosplenomegaly , cherry-red spot , dysmorphic feature , skeletal change present aside scoliosis ( mild vertebral change may reveal radiog-raphy ) , short stature common . GM2-Gangliosidosis The GM2 gangliosidosis group lysosomal lipid storage disorder cause mutation least 1 3 recessive gene : HEXA , HEXB , GM2A . Normal product 3 gene require normal catabolism GM2 ganglioside substrate . Deficient activity enzymes lead accumulation substrate inside neuronal lysosome , lead cell death . The product 3 gene , respectively , alpha subunit b-hexosaminidase A ( Hex A ) . Hex A dimer structure alpha-beta . β-Hexosaminidase B ( Hex B ) dimer beta chain . It hydrolyze GM2 neutral asialo derivative GA2 . Both subunit precursor acquire mannose 6-phosphate marker recognition lysosome . Hexosaminidase S ( Hex S ) dimer alpha chain ; normal constituent plasma degrades wide range glycoconjugates contain β-linked N-acetylhexosaminyl res-idues . With lack beta-subunits increase polymerization alpha subunits lead increase formation Hex S Tay - Sachs disease . GM2A cofactor require normal function Hex A ; it´s disruption likewise lead reduce function Hex A . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment . Examining saliva sample allow determine whether measurement feasible saliva sample promote early detection GM1/GM2 disease .</detailed_description>
