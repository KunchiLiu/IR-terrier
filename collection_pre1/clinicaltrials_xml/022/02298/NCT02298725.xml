	<detailed_description>Western Human Nutrition Research Center ( WHNRC ) scientist observe rapid substantial improvement metabolic health index non-diabetic obese person undergo weight-maintenance diet include prepared meal align current dietary recommendation , include Institute Medicine United States Department Agriculture ( USDA ) Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) Dietary Guidelines Americans . For instance , mark reduction often normalization hyperinsulinemia observe within day provision control nutrient-dense high quality diet , LDL reduce 20-30 % within 2 week possibly earlier . This indicate change diet alone would benefit many at-risk person respect normalize metabolic parameter disease risk marker . Yet , surprisingly little formal research focus high quality , weight maintain diet impact health short-term period at-risk individual . The overall objective study determine nutrient-adequate diet closely align food group recommendation set 2010 Dietary Guidelines Americans elicit superior metabolic profile person at-risk metabolic disease , compare nutrient-adequate contain food closely align National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) `` What We Eat In America '' report .</detailed_description>
