	<brief_title>Individualised Versus Conventional Medical Follow-up Women After Primary Treatment Ovarian Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There recent evidence routine cancer follow-up ineffective ( Kew , 2011 ) . Knowledge best deliver follow-up remains inadequate randomise study lack . This trial compare individualise follow-up lead cancer train nurse conventional medical follow-up . Aim : The investigator shall conduct trial use experienced clinical nurse specialist ( CNSs ) deliver self-management focused individual follow-up evaluate whether brings great improvement quality life , acceptable cost saving compare standard ( conventional ) model . Design : Two arm randomise controlled trial . Setting : Specialist gynaecological cancer outpatient service three cancer centre , one inner city two urban . Sample size : A sample size 100 patient , randomise equally 2 treatment group , determine study . See statistical analysis section . Recruitment : Based previous experience recruit population approximately 50 % woman approach agree take part . The investigator need 1 year recruit sample . Randomisation : Participants subdivide two group recruit inner city centre recruit suburban . Randomisation perform independently group participant randomly allocate either conventional individualised follow-up 1:1 ratio . Allocation first participant pair one 2 follow-up strategy make use randomness derive atmospheric noise ( http : //www.random.org ) ; second participant pair allocate group . The intervention : Trial follow-up 2 year baseline . Conventional follow-up/treatment usual This remain unchanged involve : one post treatment appointment appointment every 3 month doctor . Routinely medical history take investigation monitor disease progression include serum cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) tumour marker . A physical examination may perform . The appointment sometimes involve CNS input patient may contact non-study CNS ad hoc basis . Individualised follow-up Patients meet study CNS clinic attend 4-6 week post treatment appointment . The nurse negotiate patient agree follow-up arrangement best suit need . E.g . patient-initiated telephone face-to-face appointment . The nurse ass patient appointment use assessment proforma . Data collection : Quantitative data Baseline qol questionnaire provide Research Assistant time write consent complete return prior disclosure randomisation . Subsequent questionnaire post participant reply pay envelope . Data enter 'Patient event ' data base extract patient different type service use two-year follow-up period . The investigator also record primary care contact reason questionnaire General Practitioners . Qualitative interview data Selected patient take part 45-60 minute one-to-one interview location convenient . The interview audio-recorded following consent anonymised maintain confidentiality . A semi-structured interview guide use ensure important topic area cover . CNSs interview quiet room away clinical area . Data Analysis : Quantitative data Differences mean patient qol satisfaction two group assess 2 sample t-tests . Assuming two-sided significance level 5 % 40 sample , achieve 80 % power difference quite large detectable . For satisfaction scale ( 0-100 ) , estimate common standard deviation = 14.7 ( de Bock et al ( 2004 ) ) , difference two group 9.3 would detectable 80 % power . For anxiety ( 0-13 ) depression ( 0-14 ) measure common standard deviation = 2.75 case ( de Bock et al 2004 ) , difference would need 1.74 case . The investigator may able detect small difference plan sample size take account adjustment baseline value sample size calculation compare randomise group ( analysis covariance ) . For qol scale various sub-scales ( 0-100 ) evidence literature source suggest scale standard deviation approximately 20-25 ( Greimel et al 2003 ) . Using value , difference mean , detectable 80 % power , would 12.7 15.9 . Even ensue result able detect clinically important difference two group , scale score provide useful information may justify inquiry . The total cost follow-up patient calculate multiply service use unit cost obtain relevant National Health Service ( NHS ) Reference Costs sum across type use . Unadjusted service use total cost compare group use Mann-Whitney two-sample statistic . Qualitative data Interviews fully transcribe analysed accord principle ground theory ( Strauss Corbin , 1991 ) .</detailed_description>
