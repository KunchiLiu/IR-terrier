	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( also know Sly syndrome ) inherit disease cause lack enzyme beta-glucuronidase . This enzyme need break substance body call glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . If enzyme present , GAGs break build cell damage . This cause wide range problem short stature , skeletal abnormality , joint stiffness , enlarge spleen liver , lung infection , heart problem hernias . Patients usually die within first year life , although survive teenage year . Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII life-threatening disease many patient die early childhood . It also debilitate due physical skeletal abnormality occur . Sly syndrome characterize coarse facial feature , hepatosplenomegaly , protrude sternum dystosis multiplex . Dystosis multiplex refers constellation skeletal abnormality characterize enlarged skull , thicken calvarium , premature closure lamboid sagittal suture , shallow orbit , enlarge J-shaped sella abnormal space teeth dentigerous cyst . There anterior hypoplasia lumbar vertebra , long bone diaphysis enlarge irregular appearance metaphyses . The epiphyseal center well develop , pelvis poorly form small femoral head coxa valga . The clavicle short , thick irregular rib oar shape . Phalanges shorten trapezoidal shape . At time designation , mucopolysaccharidosis type VII affect approximately 0.001 10,000 people European Union ( EU ) * . This equivalent total around 50 people , ceiling orphan designation , 5 people 10,000 . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment . Examining saliva sample allow determine whether measurement feasible saliva sample promote early detection Sly disease .</detailed_description>
