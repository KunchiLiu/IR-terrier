	<brief_title>Biomarker Mucolipidosis Disorder Type I , II , III IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucolipidoses ( ML ) group inherit metabolic disease glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) another group substances call sphingolipids build body . GAGs long , repeat chain complex sugar molecule , sphingolipids fat . ML disorder may also refer `` target defect '' affect individual lack enzyme ( protein produce chemical reaction body ) `` target '' enzymes lysosome ( sac-like structure find cell ) . Symptoms ML congenital ( present birth ) begin early childhood adolescence . Early symptom include vision problem developmental delay . Over time , many child ML develop poor mental capacity , difficulty reach normal developmental milestone , , many case , eventually die disease . Changes specific gene result deficiency absence target enzyme . The ML disorder categorize four group base clinical feature enzyme deficiency . ML-II ML-III common form ML . An individual usually suspect ML disorder base clinical feature . The diagnosis confirm laboratory testing . The mucolipidoses inherit autosomal recessive manner , , occur child inherits two copy defective gene , one parent . When parent carry defective gene , child face one four chance develop one MLs . At time , child also face one two chance inherit one copy defective gene . People one defective gene know carrier . These individual develop disease pas defective gene child . Because defective gene involve certain form ML know , test identify people carrier instance . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future Disorder earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment . Examining saliva sample allow determine whether measurement feasible saliva sample promote early detection mucolipidosis disorder type I , II , III IV .</detailed_description>
