	<detailed_description>Hurler disease - MPS I- ( mucopolysaccharidosis I ) inherit lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency alpha-L-iduronidase , lysosomal enzyme normally require breakdown certain complex carbohydrate know glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . If enzyme present sufficient quantity , normal breakdown GAGs incomplete block . The cell unable excrete carbohydrate residue accumulate lysosome cell . This accumulation disrupt cell 's normal functioning give rise clinical manifestation disease . The incidence MPS I estimate 1 100,000 birth . It inherit autosomal recessive manner , affect male female equally , case , parent affect child asymptomatic carrier disease.Types MPS I . Children diagnose MPS I historically classify one three category base severity symptom rate disease progression . It become clear , however , wide spectrum severity MPS I much overlap category . • Hurler Syndrome : The severe form MPS I characterize progressive developmental delay severe progressive physical problem . Death often occur 10 year age . • Hurler-Scheie Syndrome : The intermediate form MPS I characterize normal near normal intelligence severe physical symptom Scheie Syndrome . • Scheie Syndrome : The attenuated form MPS I characterize normal intelligence , usually normal height , milder physical problem Hurler-Scheie . These individual potentially normal life span . Patients present within first year life musculoskeletal alteration include short stature , dysostosis multiplex , thoracic-lumbar kyphosis , progressive coarsen facial feature include large head bulge frontal bone , depress nasal bridge broad nasal tip anteverted nostril , full cheek enlarge lip , cardiomyopathy valvular abnormality , neurosensorial hearing loss , enlarge tonsil adenoid , nasal secretion . Developmental delay usually observe 12 24 month life primarily speech realm progressive cognitive sensorial deterioration . Hydrocephaly occur age two . Diffuse corneal compromise lead corneal opacity become detectable three year age . Other manifestation include organomegaly , hernias hirsutism . MPS1 syndrome cause mutation IDUA gene ( 4p16.3 ) lead complete deficiency alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme lysosomal accumulation dermatan sulfate heparan sulfate . Transmission autosomal recessive . Early diagnosis difficult first clinical sign specific , important allow early treatment . Diagnosis base detection increase urinary excretion heparan dermatan sulfate 1 , 9-dimethylmethylene blue ( DMB ) test glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) electrophoresis , demonstration enzymatic deficiency leukocytes fibroblast . Genetic test available . Differential diagnosis include mild form mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 , MPS1-Scheie syndrome , although form associate developmental delay slight cognitive impairment . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment . Examining saliva sample allow determine whether measurement feasible saliva sample promote early detection MPS1 disease . Though MPS1 disease pan-ethnic disorder , prevalence autosomal-recessive disorder elevate country higher frequency consanguinity . Therefore , estimate every 400th newborn Arabian country may eligible inclusion due high-grade suspicion MPS1 disease , approximately every 2000th newborn non-Arabian country may eligible .</detailed_description>
