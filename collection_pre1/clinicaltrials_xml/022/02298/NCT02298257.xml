	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect best dose brentuximab vedotin combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage III-IV human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -associated Hodgkin lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , brentuximab vedotin , block cancer growth find cancer cell cause die . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine sulfate , dacarbazine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving brentuximab vedotin together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial AVD Brentuximab Vedotin ( SGN-35 ) Treatment Stage III-IV HIV-associated Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This phase II study . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , vinblastine sulfate IV , dacarbazine IV day 1 15 . Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV 30 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : • To establish estimate two-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient HIV-associated stage III-IV Hodgkin lymphoma treat use brentuximab vedotin plus AVD chemotherapy regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To evaluate toxicity AVD brentuximab vedotin highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . - To estimate partial response ( PR ) rate , complete response ( CR ) rate , overall survival ( OS ) , event free survival ( EFS ) 2 5 year . - To evaluate effect AVD brentuximab vedotin CD4 CD8 count cycle 1 , 4 , end therapy , every 3 month treatment completion one year . - To investigate prognostic value FDG-PET/CT scan baseline , cycle 2 , treatment completion , respect 2-year progression free survival . - To evaluate HAART status baseline correlate tumor response therapy OS PFS . - To characterize histologic subtypes HIV-HL HAART era . - To assess neurotoxicity HAART combination AVD brentuximab vedotin . - To evaluate effect AVD brentuximab vedotin viral load cycle 1 , 4 , completion therapy , every 3 month treatment completion one year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use brentuximab vedotin combination AVD patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study 2 . HIV1 infection , document licensed HIV rapid test perform conjunction screening ( ELISA test kit confirm Western blot approve test ) . A measurable HIV viral load alone sufficient documentation diagnosis HIV . Alternatively , documentation may include record another physician document participant HIV infection base prior ELISA western blot , approve diagnostic test 3 . Histologic diagnosis CD30positive classical HL define 2008 WHO Classification Hematological disease . Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma eligible 4 . Stage III IV disease define Ann Arbor Staging System 5 . Participants must previously untreated HIVcHL , exception 14 consecutive day steroids 1 prior cycle cyclophosphamide reduce tumor burden improve hyperbilirubinemia set lymphoma relate liver involvement 6 . Normal baseline cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50 % 7 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL . If creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ( 132 micromol/L ) , creatinine clearance must ≥ 60 mL/minute accord MDRD/CockroftGault formula 8 . ANC ≥ 1000/µL platelet ≥ 75,000/µL unless relate bone marrow involvement HIVcHL 9 . A direct bilirubin level ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ( 34 µmol/L ) . If , however , elevate bilirubin felt secondary antiretroviral therapy , total bilirubin must ≤ 3.5 mg/dL ( 59 µmol/L ) , provide direct bilirubin normal AST ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit normal . Also , elevate bilirubin think secondary cHL patient exclude study participation 10 . Female subject must negative pregnancy test within 1 week enrollment subject must agree use two reliable method contraception simultaneously conception possible study Should woman subject become pregnant suspect pregnant subject participate study , inform treat physician immediately . The patient remove protocol therapy Subjects father child participate study permit continue protocol . The subject , however , require notify investigator father child 11 .

Karnofsky performance status &gt; 30 % ( give aggressiveness disease often severely debilitated nature patient initial presentation ) . See Appendix 20.519.5 13 . Measurable nonmeasurable ( evaluable ) tumor parameter ( ) . Nonmeasurable tumor parameter define bidimensional measurement ( i.e. , gastric marrow involvement ) follow response diagnostic test gallium , PET image and/or bone marrow biopsy 14 . Patients already receive erythropoietin GCSF treatment HIVrelated cytopenia eligible 15 . CD4 count ≥ 100 cells/µl serum HIV viral load &lt; 50copies/ml 16 . Subjects required antiretroviral regimen accordance current International AIDS Society guideline concurrently chemotherapy . Use experimental antiretroviral agent contain zidovudine ritonavir , cobicistat similar potent CYP3 inhibitor prohibit , explain Section 5.7 . In order eligible , patient take zidovudine ritonavir , cobicistat CYP3 inhibitor must change different regimen 7 day prior therapy initiation . Subjects must HAART least 12 week prior therapy . See section 10.3 17 . Patients require obtain pulmonary function test , despite exclusion bleomycin protocol regimen . The subject 's diffusing capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) adjust hemoglobin must great 70 % predict enter study continue brentuximab vedotin 18 . Negative Hepatitis B , infect Hepatitis B , receive antiHepatitis B therapy . All subject require screen Hepatitis B . Per IDSA AASD guideline , subject show immunity , define lack Hepatitis B surface antibody , show evidence chronic infection ( i.e. , HBsAg+ , HBcore+ , HBsAB ) require antiHepatitis B therapy study order eligible . Patients permit enroll study provide normal liver function test ( see Section 9.3 ) evidence cirrhosis . The exact Hepatitis B therapy discretion infection disease specialist investigator . However patient present acute hepatitis B show normal transaminase HBsAg+ IgM+ Hepatitis core antigen eligible trial enrollment 19 . Patients diagnose Hepatitis C Hepatitis C antibody positive , whether Hepatitis C RNA level measurable , must evidence cirrhosis liver function test conform Section 9.3 1 .
