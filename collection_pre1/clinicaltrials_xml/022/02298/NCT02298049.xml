	<brief_summary>To knowledge study assessed effect meal neural response food cue compare condition simulate natural inter-meal hunger level . This important , existing literature often compare effect fast satiation , may reflect typical appetite process . Thus , purpose research examine effect satiate lunch compare normal pre-meal state blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) activity human brain , measure use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An fMRI Study Satiation Healthy Volunteers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize satiation would associate decreased brain activity across brain region involve appetite reward ventromedial prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex , ventral striatum , hypothalamus , insula , amygdala hippocampus . 16 healthy participant ( 8 male ) scan two separate test day , eat meal satiation , eat 4 hour ( satiate vs. pre-meal ) . fMRI BOLD signal sight and/or taste stimulus record . Participants give questionnaire complete mood state appetite scan .</detailed_description>
