	<brief_summary>Background : Electroporation electropermeabilisation novel technique potential overcome main disadvantage thermal ablation . It utilize electric pulse , travel two electrode , create 'nanopores ' cell membrane . If apply current reach certain threshold 'nanopores ' become permanent result cell death . The use electric current mean IRE susceptible 'thermal sink ' leading consistent ablation result . IRE ablation target cell membrane , spar tissue architecture minimize damage blood vessel , nerve renal collect system . The first human study prove safety IRE ablation small renal mass . However efficacy IRE histopathological examination ablate renal tumour yet study , compromise correct scientific evaluation new technology . Primary Objectives : - To determine efficacy IRE ablation renal mass , measure histopathologic examination target tumour . - To determine safety IRE ablation renal mass , evaluate device procedural adverse event . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate efficacy MRI image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . - To evaluate efficacy CEUS image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . Population : 10 patient , age ≥ 18 year , present solid enhance mass , candidate radical nephrectomy . Intervention : Eligible patient receive IRE ablation renal mass 4 week prior radical nephrectomy . Follow-up one four week post IRE perform use MRI CEUS imaging . After radical nephrectomy histopathological examination perform evaluate IRE ablation success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The past decade show increase incidence small renal mass ( SRM ) . At moment laparoscopic partial nephrectomy 'golden standard ' treatment SRMs . Thermal ablation technique indicate patient poor surgical candidate predisposition develop multiple tumour . Recent study show thermal ablation technique similar long-term oncologic result . Downsides thermal ablation possible damage vital structure vicinity ablation zone , e.g . collect system intestine , unpredictable result due difficulty monitor ablation zone 'thermal sink ' . Electroporation electropermeabilisation novel technique potential overcome main disadvantage thermal ablation . It utilize electric pulse , travel two electrode , create 'nanopores ' cell membrane . If apply current reach certain threshold 'nanopores ' become permanent result cell death . The use electric current mean IRE susceptible 'thermal sink ' leading consistent ablation result . IRE ablation target cell membrane , spar tissue architecture minimize damage blood vessel , nerve renal collect system . The first human study prove safety IRE ablation small renal mass . However efficacy IRE histopathological examination ablate renal tumour yet study , compromise correct scientific evaluation new technology . This primary objective research project . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - To determine efficacy IRE ablation renal mass , measure histopathologic examination target tumour . - To determine safety IRE ablation renal mass , evaluate device procedural adverse event . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate efficacy MRI image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . - To evaluate efficacy CEUS image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . Study design : This prospective , human , in-vivo pilot study . Study population : 10 patient , age ≥ 18 year , present solid enhancing RM , candidate radical nephrectomy . Intervention : Patients receive IRE ablation RM , perform general anaesthesia , 4 week radical nephrectomy . Follow-up one four week post IRE perform use MRI CEUS imaging . After radical nephrectomy histopathological examination perform evaluate IRE ablation success . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint : - The efficacy IRE ablation renal mass , measure histopathologic examination target tumour experience genitourinary pathologist . Using immunehistochemical stain evaluate cell viability . - The safety IRE ablation renal mass , evaluate device procedural adverse event use CTCAE v4.0 . Secondary endpoint : - The efficacy MRI image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . By compare MRI image histopathological examination result resect material . - The efficacy CEUS image ablation success , extend ablation zone , one four week post IRE ablation . By compare CEUS image histopathological examination result resect material . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : There benefit patient participate study . Study participant expose additional risk compare standard treatment . They undergo additional procedure general anaesthesia muscle relaxation . The exposure ionize radiation procedure estimate 32 mSv . Patients informed risk procedural complication . Information efficacy IRE , proven histopathologically , vital step order progress long term follow-up study without tumour excision . So far study investigate efficacy IRE ablation renal tumour manner .</detailed_description>
