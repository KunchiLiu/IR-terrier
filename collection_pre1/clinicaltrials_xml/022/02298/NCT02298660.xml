	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate impact 200 U intradetrusor inject OnabotulinumtoxinA ( Botox , Allergan , Inc. ) ( 20 site , trigone sparing ) neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) role reduce autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) chronic , traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . In clinical practice , urinary bladder dysfunction commonly associate episode AD . If AD misdiagnosed poorly manage , may result myocardial infarction , stroke , seizure , intracerebral hemorrhage even death . Reducing AD would dramatically improve health well-being Canadians SCI , positively impact health care cost . There estimate 7,343 hospital re-admissions due SCI-related condition Canada every year , estimate 5-year cost $ 661 million . Reducing hospital re-admissions secondary complication SCI 10 % time period could result cost save $ 66 million Canada . Considering statistic , present study could first attempt evaluate economic impact use Botox manage urinary bladder follow SCI . We able examine impact episode AD consequently calculate cost save Canadian health system . A significant number individual SCI require frequent emergency room visit due episode uncontrolled AD originate predominately urinary bladder . There clinical evidence demonstrating cost bladder management follow SCI depend understand volume urinary bladder safely hold . This one positive outcome establish previous trial Botox therapy neurogenic bladder . Hypothesis : 200 U intradetrusor inject Botox ( 20 site , trigone sparing ) neurogenic bladder detrusor hyperreflexia decrease severity AD individual SCI one month follow treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botox Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity Prevention Autonomic Dysreflexia Following SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : This study Phase IV pilot study . A phase IV study study approve drug treatment conduct obtain information regard drug 's treatment 's , benefit optimal use . The investigator assess efficacy Botox reduce autonomic dysreflexia regular treatment neurogenic detrusor overactivity spinal cord injury . The aim study prove positive/negative effect Botox injection urinary bladder function ( previously establish randomize controlled clinical trial ) , gain information intervention could ameliorate change arterial blood pressure ( namely prevent autonomic dysreflexia ) commonly occur due neurogenic detrusor overactivity . This study particularly determine whether establish Botox therapy neurogenic detrusor overactivity could decrease severity episode AD least 50 % . Objective 1 : The primary objective study assess efficacy intradetrusor inject Botox amelioration episode AD individual chronic SCI . Primary outcome : To assess effect Botox reduce AD per average systolic blood pressure change ( maximum systolic blood pressure subtract average supine baseline systolic blood pressure ) induce urodynamics . The end point trial decrease severity AD 50 % participant . By definition AD consider episode hypertension due painful non painful stimulus level injury increase systolic blood pressure least 20-40 mmHg , previously measure , individual baseline . Episodes AD trigger variety cause , include related bladder function . In order focus , investigator specifically select primary outcome decrease systolic blood pressure episodes AD trigger urodynamics , one know iatrogenic cause AD . Secondary outcome : Objective 2 . To assess effect Botox reduce AD severity frequency 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor daily catheterization . Objective 3 . To undertake retrospective cost analysis Botox treatment AD care follow six month treatment . Objective 4 . To assess effect Botox reduce AD sign symptom per response AD health-related quality life ( AD HR-QoL ) questionnaire improve bladder-related quality life per incontinence quality life ( I-QOL ) questionnaire . The investigator utilize previously establish protocol Canada treatment neurogenic detrusor hyperreflexia Botox injection . Injections perform qualified urologist ( Dr. Mark Nigro , Vancouver , BC ; Dr. Daniel Rapoport - Richmond , BC ) designate centre . Individuals recruit informed consent obtain . The severity AD establish treatment standardize urodynamic /cystometry procedure ( Drs . Nigro ) continuous blood pressure electrocardiogram monitoring ( Dr. Krassioukov ) . Additionally , 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure symptoms/severity AD catheterization bowel routine record . OnabotulinumtoxinA ( BotoxÂ® , Allergan , Inc. ) Total dose OR units/kg ( per patient ) : 200U Number cycles:1 Treatments conduct accord previously establish protocol , 200 unit intravesical injection cystoscopic guide injection 20 point . One month later , urodynamics continuous blood pressure ECG measurement repeat , well 24 hour blood pressure monitoring symptom record . Finally , HRQoL questionnaires administer evaluate effect Botox AD quality life . Primary efficacy variable : Severity AD urodymanics test follow Botox treatment . Pre - post comparison . Urodynamics evaluation conduct pre post ( 1 month ) Botox injection ( 200 unit 20 point ) continuous blood pressure heart rate monitoring . Secondary efficacy variable : 1 . 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring conduct 1 week Botox injection 1 month post Botox treatment . Daily variation blood pressure high blood pressure measure catheterization bowel routine . 2 . A retrospective chart analysis hospital admission related AD 6 month prior receive treatment Botox therapy bladder management , 6 month follow Botox treatment , evaluate economical impact health care . Cost analysis undertaken collaboration Dr. Stirling Centre Clinical Epidemiology Evaluation , School Population Public Health UBC . Dr. Stirling currently collaborate Dr. Krassioukov 's CIHR Cardiovascular health SCI team grant . The objective cost analysis estimate direct medical cost associate admission episode AD treatment Botox neurogenic bladder . This approach establish baseline estimate current unknown , allow determination cost consequence directly attributable Botox intervention . The care cost analysis 3-stage process : determining relevant resource item , collect data regard unit resource use , identify appropriate unit cost . Patient-specific total cost estimate derive aggregate improve cardiovascular outcome ( decrease severity AD 50 % ) unit resource multiply respective unit cost . The benefit patient-level cost data well document ( e.g. , data cleaning , investigate source variability ) . Accordingly , plan micro-costing exercise generate patient-level cost estimate admission episodes AD pre-treatment ( 6 month retrospective chart analysis ) post-treatment ( 6 month analysis ) phase . This study design overcome methodological problem associate previous cost research SCI , like focus single centers/providers rely patient recall health care use . 3 . Statistical analysis . The primary outcome include cardiovascular parameter include baseline heart rate arterial blood pressure ( urodynamics ) . Additionally , arterial blood pressure heart rate lability examine 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring via questionnaire ass participant report frequency severity AD impact quality life Botox bladder relate health . 4 . The AD health-related quality life ( AD HR-QoL ) questionnaire assess impact Botox improve AD-related QoL . This questionnaire base modify version reliable Autonomic Dysreflexia Following Spinal Cord Injury Questionnaire . The Incontinence- QoL Questionnaire , also utilized assess impact Botox improve bladder-related health .</detailed_description>
