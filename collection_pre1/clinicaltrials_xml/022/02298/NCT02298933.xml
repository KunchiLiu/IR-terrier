	<brief_summary>Background : - Platelets tiny cell blood help stop bleeding . Thrombocytopenia happen people enough normal platelet . Getting transfusion another person platelets help stop much bleeding . But cell people , body may reject , put risk serious bleed complication . This condition call alloimmune platelet refractoriness . There evidence many patient , platelet count fail increase platelet transfusion transfuse platelet destroy body defence soldier , call complement . Researchers want see drug , inhibit complement , help increase platelet level reduce bleed Objectives : - To see eculizumab increase platelet level transfusion . To see reduces chance bleed much . Eligibility : - Adults 18-75 year old thrombocytopenia alloimmune platelet refractoriness . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants procedure list . They hospital . Or go outpatient clinic . Each visit may take 3 hour . - Participants get meningitis vaccine need . Then get study drug infusion . - Participants platelet transfusion . Their blood drawn every 24 hour platelet count le 10,000 per 1 microliter blood . - They take antibiotic 14 day . - Participants checkup blood drawn twice week 2 week . They get transfusion need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complement Inhibition Using Eculizumab Overcome Platelet Transfusion Refractoriness Patients With Severe Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet transfusion life-saving procedure prevent treat serious bleed patient low and/or dysfunctional platelet . Treatment blood cancer blood disease well bone marrow transplantation possible without platelet transfusion support . Unfortunately , 20-60 % chronically transfused patient stop respond transfusion put risk serious bleed complication . Data support concept many patient , platelet count fail increase platelet transfusion transfuse platelet destroy body complement . In order overcome problem , inhibit complement activity medication eculizumab specifically bind suppresses complement . We hypothesize treat patient platelet refractoriness eculizumab , platelet count increase high number platelet transfusion , decrease risk bleed complication associate low platelet count .</detailed_description>
