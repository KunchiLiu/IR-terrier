	<brief_summary>Acute cholecystitis commonly occur elderly patient high-risk candidate surgery . Percutaneous cholecystostomy ( PC ) frequently employ gallbladder drainage patient . Recently , feasibility EUS-guided gallbladder drainage ( EGBD ) treatment condition demonstrate two procedure compare one another uncertain . The aim study compare EGBD versus PC definitive treatment , high-risk patient suffer acute cholecystitis randomize control trial . We hypothesize EGBD reduce morbidity , re-intervention mortality compare PC .</brief_summary>
