	<brief_summary>The Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) guideline recommend two `` core '' strategy Antibiotic Stewardship ( AS ) : 1 ) antimicrobial restriction preauthorization 2 ) prospective audit intervention feedback . Community hospital limit resource staff dedicate AS . Thus , understand core strategy feasible effective practice set would assist appropriate allocation limit resource . The purpose study evaluate feasibility implement antimicrobial restriction preauthorization vs. post antibiotic prescription review resource-limited community hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study three-stage cluster randomize historically control crossover trial design evaluate feasibility implementation two AS strategy . Four community hospital Duke Infection Control Outreach Network ( DICON ) recruit study . Ideally , hospital teach affiliation , bed size &lt; 300 , exist antimicrobial formulary restriction preauthorization post-antibiotic prescription review practice place study start . Data obtain four community hospital three stage . In stage 1 , historical data hospital collect year prior study initiation participate hospital . These data use control represent current practice . In stage 2 , four hospital divide two pair base upon bed size . One hospital pair randomly assign six-month period antimicrobial restriction preauthorization ( Strategy 1 ; stage 2 ) follow six-month period post-antibiotic prescription review ( Strategy 2 ; stage 3 ) . The two hospital undergo Strategy 2 stage 2 follow Strategy 1 stage 3 help alleviate concern seasonal/temporal effect compare strategy . A one-month wash perform stage . Three antibiotic specifically target intervention : anti-pseudomonal carbapenem choice study hospital , vancomycin , piperacillin-tazobactam . Utilization alternative antimicrobial , include fluoroquinolones , cephalosporin , anti-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( anti MRSA ) systemic antimicrobial ( e.g. , nafcillin , daptomycin , linezolid , ceftaroline , clindamycin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMP-SMX ) ) also collect . All study hospitals electronic system track antimicrobial prescription order , electronic medication administration record ( eMAR ) , bar-coded medication administration ( BCMA ) , dispense data . Hospitals dedicate clinical pharmacist time preauthorization post-antibiotic review three target antibiotic arm study . Pharmacists ( PharmDs ) site receive standardize training study personnel order address common question anticipated argument , establish robust knowledge base regard target antimicrobial ( anti-pseudomonal carbapenem choice study hospital , vancomycin , piperacillin-tazobactam ) . They also train conflict management . Study personnel provide suggest criterion appropriate use target drug . Hospital P &amp; T committees review , edit ( desire ) , approve hospital-specific protocol appropriate use criterion study drug . Pharmacists provide specific clinical pathway urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) , community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , healthcare-associated pneumonia ( HCAP ) , bacteremia , `` '' use target antimicrobial . Clinical pathway develop jointly study personnel base Centers Disease Control Prevention pilot project . Clinical pharmacist determine appropriateness therapy base study clinical pathway , baseline knowledge , acquire knowledge derive training study personnel . Time spent perform two stewardship strategy support grant fund . The designated pharmacist involve two critical component protocol : ) complete intervention b ) document outcome intervention .</detailed_description>
