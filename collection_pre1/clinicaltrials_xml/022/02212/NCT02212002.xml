	<brief_title>Effect Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis ( IAP ) Development Neonatal Gut Microbiota .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At birth , neonatal gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tract rapidly colonize maternal environmental bacteria ; first colonizer generally aerobes facultative anaerobe , follow strict anaerobe ( e.g . Bifidobacterium spp. , Bacteroides spp. , Clostridium spp. ) . The composition gut microbiota influence several factor , mode delivery , gestational age , maternal intestinal vaginal microbiota , type feeding , hospitalization birth use antibiotic probiotic . Gut microbiota term infant , vaginally deliver exclusively breastfed , consider ideally healthy , low count C. difficile E. coli high number Bidifobacteria Lactobacilli , positively influence host 's health activate immunocompetent cell GI tract , promote production secretory IgA increase bactericidal activity neutrophils cell-mediated immunity NK cell activity . Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) one important cause neonatal infection sepsis . Infants vaginally deliver may acquire GBS birth process maternal vagina , cervix rectum , reside approximately 10-20 % pregnant woman . Since mid-90s , incidence early-onset GBS sepsis significantly reduce , due introduction GBS universal screen late pregnancy consequent intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis ( IAP ) GBS-positive woman . Recent data suggest use antibiotic early life could alter commensal gut microbiota , thereby impair balance health disease later life . The effect IAP bacterial colonization infant 's gut largely investigate . Moreover , currently available data issue largely derive study perform use culture-based technique ; however , accurate culture-based result influence selection correct medium , temperature , oxygen content time growth , reason little 10-50 % entire gut bacteria easily culture . Molecular technique , base amplification 16S ribosomal bacterial RNA gene differentiate prokaryotic taxon , recently develop study gut microbiota , thus enable detailed characterization bacterial community standard culture . We previously evaluate effect IAP relatively small sample exclusively breast-fed term infant vaginally deliver mean molecular technique ; 7 day life several difference microbiota composition infant IAP-exposed expose . The aim present paper thus evaluate difference detail , expand initial sample follow infant one month age . Influences type feed microbiota composition also explore . Healthy term infant , vaginally deliver , birth weight adequate gestational age , whose mother screen GBS 35-37 week gestation , enrol study . Infants exclude : - preterm small/large gestational age - born caesarean section - mother receive antibiotic 4 week delivery ; - maternal IAP perform reason GBS positivity ( i.e . prolonged rupture membrane GBS-negative woman ) ; - maternal IAP inadequate ; - maternal IAP perform antibiotic ampicillin , erythromycin ; - infant major congenital malformation ; - infant develop sign infection and/or receive antibiotic treatment birth ; - infant serious clinical condition contraindicate his/her participation study . Infants allocate two group accord maternal GBS status IAP : - IAP group : infant born GBS-positive mother receive adequate IAP . According Institutional treatment protocol GBS prophylaxis ( derive CDC guideline ) , iv ampicillin give every 4 hour delivery ( first dose 2 g , follow dos 1 g ) . IAP consider adequate mother receive least two dos ampicillin delivery . - Control group : infant born GBS-negative mother , receive antibiotic treatment before/at delivery . Written inform consent obtain infant 's parent/legal guardian infant discharge nursery ( 48-72 hour life ) . Patients ' characteristic , include gestational age , birth weight , gender , Apgar score 1 ' 5 ' birth , summarize specific case report form . Two faecal sample infant collect follow visit 7 30 day life . At visit , information weight gain , clinical condition , feeding , on-going treatment ( i.e . use prebiotics , probiotic , antibiotic ) , collect infant ' parent . After collection , faecal sample put numbered screw-capped sterile plastic container immediately frozen −80 °C , process bacterial DNA extraction . Microbiological analysis perform Department Agricultural Sciences , University Bologna . Investigators perform analysis blind group identity infant ( IAP control group ) . Two hundred milligram faeces use bacterial DNA extraction use QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit ( QIAGEN , West Sussex , UK ) . Extracted DNA store −80 °C . The purity concentration extract DNA determine measure ratio absorbance 260 280 nm ( Infinite® 200 PRO NanoQuant , Tecan , Mannedorf , Switzerland ) . Quantification select microbial group ( Lactobacillus spp. , Bifidobacterium spp. , Bacteroides fragilis ) perform real-time PCR . Data obtain amplification transform obtain number bacterial cell per gram faeces , express log colony form unit ( CFU ) /g . The obtain data analyze use IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 ( IBM Corporation , IBM Corporation Armonk , New York , United States ) . Baseline characteristic IAP control group compare use independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . The influence IAP faecal bacterial count 7 30 day life evaluate use independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test . A hierarchical multiple regression analysis perform order estimate effect IAP faecal bacterial count control type infant feeding ( coded binary categorical variable : exclusive breastfeeding vs. formula feed ) . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
