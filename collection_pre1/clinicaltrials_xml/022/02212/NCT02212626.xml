	<detailed_description>The treatment acute subacute thromboembolic local thrombotic ischemic lesion ilaco-popliteal segment low extremity undergone considerable change recent year . The standard modality surgical thrombectomy Fogarty balloon catheter technique acute arterial occlusion replace percutaneous catheter technique , i.e . percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy ( PAT ) thrombus aspiration . Alternatively , catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy without additional catheter aspiration use , particularly occlusion already day week old . These technique obtain best result acute occlusion less 2 week ' duration . Both technique limitation application fibrinolytic substance technical , impossibility rapid complete thrombus extraction . Therefore various mechanical device introduce involve maceration fragmentation removal thrombus . The two category device mechanical thrombectomy ( MT ) : ( 1 ) rotational recirculation device work vortex principle , Amplatz thrombectomy catheter ( ATD , Microvena , White Bear Lake , MN ) Arrow-Trerotola PTD ( Arrow International , Reading , PA ) ; ( 2 ) hydrodynamic ( rheolytic ) recirculation device operate principle Venturi effect , Hydrolyser ( Cordis , Johnson Johnson , Miami , FL ) , Oasis ( Boston Scientific , Galway , Ireland ) , Angiojet ( RTC ; Possis Medical , Minneapolis , MN ) [ 5-10 ] . These device suit subacute occlusion 7-14 day ' duration . Recently , new rotational mechanical thrombectomy catheter , Straub Rotarex / Aspirex ( Straub Medical , 7323 Wangs , Switzerland ) introduce . This device combine two essential effect mechanical clot fragmentation removal fragment clot material vessel negative pressure . Two study use Rotarex system 38 , resp . 98 patient show primary patency rate 62 % , resp . 54 % 6 month describe Rotarex / Aspirex system efficient quick technique revascularization acute femoropopliteal de novo occlusion . A recent publication date 2011 report result use Rotarex® catheter treatment in-stent reocclusions femoropopliteal artery . In 78 patient , restenosis rate calculate 18.4 % 12 month . The purpose Belgian multi-center study follow-up patient recanalization Rotarex®S catheter system ( Straub Medical ) acute subacute femoropopliteal stent occlusion .</detailed_description>
