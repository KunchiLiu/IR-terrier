	<brief_summary>VISTA look see vitamin D supplement bariatric surgery might improve vitamin D store , may help prevent complication like infection . Who join research study ? - Approved undergo bariatric surgery—Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy—at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center - 18 64 year age - BMI 35 49.9 kg/m2 - VitD insufficient deficient prior surgery What happen participant chooses participate research study ? - The participant randomly assign ( chance ) receive either : - Standard care plus vitamin D supplement - Standard care plus placebo ( contain vitamin D ) - Either would provide cost participant - The investigator ask participant complete survey day surgery regard supplement use - The investigator follow participant medical record 12 month follow clinic visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Improve Nutrition Prior Bariatric Surgery Investigate Relationship With Negative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 2 3 American adult either overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 ) obese ( BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2 ) . The prevalence obesity , morbid obesity ( BMI 40-44.9 kg/m2 ) , even super obesity ( BMI ≥ 45 kg/m2 ) increase . Obesity lead contributor global mortality contribute burden disease associate diabetes , cardiovascular disease , musculoskeletal disorder osteoarthritis , cancer . Morbid obesity reduce life expectancy 8 10 year , similar effect regular cigarette smoker . Several study demonstrate obese adult vitamin D ( VitD ) insufficient ( &lt; 75 nmol/L , 30 ng/ml ) deficient ( &lt; 50 nmol/L , 20 ng/ml ) . The inverse relationship body mass index ( BMI ) body fat mass VitD status hypothesize due sequestration VitD adipose tissue , reduce bioavailability VitD . The classical role VitD maintenance bone calcification , recent research elucidate varied role hormone . Lack VitD associate increased susceptibility infection , autoimmunity , cancer , chronic disease . Bariatric surgery currently successful mean long-term weight loss . Since deficiency fat-soluble vitamin , VitD , consider metabolic complication bariatric surgery , determine VitD status individual perhaps correct prior surgery may prove greatly beneficial . Potential complication relate VitD insufficiency deficiency include adverse surgical outcome improper wound healing , infection surgical incision , atrial fibrillation . Since indication bariatric surgery obesity obesity-related comorbidities , bariatric surgery patient increase risk adverse surgical outcome . The Johns Hopkins Center Bariatric Surgery ( JHCBS ) designate Center Excellence American College Surgeons . To comply designation , center must maintain certain standard care ( SoC ) minimize complication rate . Given potential relationship VitD status adverse surgical outcome , investigator currently review pre-operative VitD status ( serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration ) collect routine SoC investigate relationship surgical outcome Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve protocol ( NA_00087502 ) . The investigator finding reveal bariatric surgery patient VitD insufficient deficient pre-operatively . To date , standard regard treat deficiency pre-operatively center intervene prior surgery . A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot trial need assess causality relationship pre-operative VitD status adverse surgical outcome bariatric surgical patient . The investigator plan identify new patient approve bariatric surgery JHCBS . These patient randomize consecutively 1:1 ratio either 30 day 10,000 International Units ( IU ) VitD3 plus SoC 30 day placebo plus SoC immediately prior surgery . The investigator monitor patient adverse surgical outcome , include wound infection , dehiscence , prolong length hospital stay . The investigator also monitor long-term clinical outcome malnutrition , weight loss , resolution comorbidities routine clinic care visit : 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month post-operatively . At visit patient assess wound healing , weight loss , nutritional status , key marker health , vital sign . The investigator aim determine 10,000 IU VitD3 daily 30 day prior bariatric surgery ( Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy ( VSG ) ) significantly increase VitD status ( serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration ) whether associate change VitD status lead decrease risk adverse surgical outcome and/or improved clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
