	<brief_title>Relations Between Cognitive Complaints Cognitive Scores Goals Cancer : Assessment Metamemory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship performance neuropsychological test subjective complaint cancer patient treat chemotherapy adjuvant hormone therapy clear , many study report significant correlation two measure : perception patient ' cognitive deficit generally increase relative measured neuropsychological testing . The reason lack association find probably multifactorial . 1 ) It explain part methodological limitation study ( lack sensitivity test , experimental design ) . 2 ) psycho-order factor fatigue also explanatory variable sense literature data often show cognitive complaint correlate level anxiety depression fatigue . 3 ) Finally , metacognition , often assess neurodegenerative disease even normal age well understand impact cognitive disorder , include memory impairment , complaint never explore patient cancer . Metacognition complex highly sensitive measure understand patient 's complaint correspondence disagree actual performance concept . Metacognition refer A ) metacognitive knowledge , ie knowledge individual 's cognitive process ; This non-dependent activity , upstream performance task , implement appropriate strategy , anticipate plan cognitive step would necessary success general knowledge ; B ) metacognitive experience , ie knowledge base cognitive activity progress , allow monitor control task order maintain otherwise modify cognitive process involve . While metacognitive knowledge ( A ) assess multiple choice questionnaire , metacognitive experience ( B ) allow target precise fine measure correspondence prediction performance patient actual performance mnemonic task ( JOL FOK Judgment Learning Feeling Of Knowing ) . Studies explore effect age metamemory usually show deficit metacognitive experience normal age compare young subject . Collected time learning , JOL prediction future performance information learn . More specifically , learn word , subject must judge ability free recall item ( quantitative data ) . This prediction compare actual memory performance find free recall task . This comparison allow judge accuracy prediction therefore accuracy metamemory judgment . The FOK correspond prediction performance information could provide free recall recognition . In practice , item recover free recall , subject must judge ability recognize correct answer among distractor response . Metacognitive process refer field memory ( metamemory ) attention ( m√©taattention ) , metamemory much value neuropsychological test test successful many .</detailed_description>
