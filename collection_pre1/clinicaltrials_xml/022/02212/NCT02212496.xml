	<detailed_description>Patients cryptogenic embolic stroke prospectively enrol categorize two group accord presence active cancer : cryptogenic embolic stroke active cancer ( cancer-associated stroke ) vs. without active cancer ( cryptogenic embolic stroke ) . All patient undergo brain MRI/MRA , 12-lead electrocardiography , transthoracic transesophageal echocardiography injection agitate saline , 24-hour Holter and/or telemonitoring . Duplex ultrasonography detect venous thrombosis lower extremity also perform patient positive right-to-left shunt echocardiography .</detailed_description>
