	<brief_summary>This small observational study contractual component 5-year ( 2013-18 ) NIHR fund programme call PERFECTED ( Peri-operative Enhanced Recovery hip FracturE Care paTiEnts Dementia ) whose overall aim develop pilot evidence-based intervention improve hospital care patient dementia suffer fracture hip . The finding particular observational study support PERFECTED work-packages establish current care practice acute hospital setting old people general hip fracture . Observation well-established qualitative technique widely use understand culture , process interaction define location include hospital . In study , researcher observe day-to-day practice specific ortho-geriatric ward Emergency Departments three English hospital ( Norfolk Norwich University Hospital , Bradford Royal Infirmary Queen 's Medical Centre Nottingham ) . Observations occur intermittently 4-week period , cover full 24h cycle . The prime objective study describe delivery care older patient hip fracture include assessment cost consequence . Crucially , observation focus exclusively upon hospital personnel routinely provide care designate location observe . Other individual frequent location ( patient , visitor peripheral health care professional ) NOT focus research regard `` incidental others '' rather `` participant '' . This approach common observational research . Observations conduct experienced qualitative researcher assist specifically trained lay researcher provide valuable service-user dimension study . Field-notes contextual information collect thematically analyse , partnership train 'lay ' researcher . Resulting data address pre-defined aim observational study feed finding report across whole work package 1 PERFECTED .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Care Delivery Acute Hospital Settings : Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale background information Hip fracture Hip fracture common orthopaedic injury amongst old adult . It estimate 1.2 million individual suffer hip fracture annually worldwide ( Gullberg et al , 1997 ) total expect surpass 6 million year 2050 ( Cooper et al , 1992 ; Od√©n et al , 2013 ) . Hip fracture significant impact health independence patient family , increase risk functional decline , admission long-term care institution high mortality rate within first 12 month post-fracture ( Seitz et al , 2011 ) . Furthermore economic implication NHS significant direct indirect cost ( Hernlund et al , 2013 ) . People dementia It estimate 25 % bed UK acute hospital ward occupy people dementia ( PwD ) ( Royal College Psychiatrists 2009 ) . Improving acute hospital care PwD high national agenda , group particularly vulnerable poor quality care adverse outcome ( NHS Confederation 2010 ) . Patients dementia - primarily old people , highly susceptible insensitive care complex need relation memory , thinking , orientation , comprehension , calculation , learn capability , language , judgment often unrecognised unaddressed ( Alzheimer Society 2009 ) . Older people family consistently place high value hospital care promote personalised relationship patient staff . This particularly pertinent people impaired cognition communication difficulty ( Alzheimer Society 2009 ) . People hip fracture dementia People dementia ( PwD ) four-fold increase risk hip fracture compare match cognitively intact cohort ( Gruneir et al , 2010 ; Laditka et al , 2005 ) . Identifying needs people dementia difficult . Engagement progress post-operative hip fracture rehabilitation also compromise patient dementia . Data suggest clinical outcome ( incidence delirium , mortality post-operative complication rate ) poorer PwD follow hip fracture compare cognitively intact individual ( Smith et al , 2013 ) . Enhanced Recovery Pathways The process `` Enhanced Recovery '' develop Denmark Prof Kehlet use UK since early 2000s ( Department Health 2013a ) . It integrate , multi-modal , evidence-based approach enables hospital patient recover surgery , treatment illness effectively leave hospital sooner . Since formal introduction NHS 2009 , Enhanced Recovery Pathways ( ERP ) become standard practice many elective surgical operation result reduction length hospital stay readmission rate generate high level patient satisfaction ( Department Health 2013a ) . Enhanced Recovery Pathways ( ERP ) elective surgery become common increase commitment drive delivery enhance recovery standard practice ( Department Health 2013a ) . ERP acute hip fracture much rarer . The pathway typically structure around six discrete phase follow patient ' journal hospital arrival discharge , : - Emergency Department - arrival diagnose - Pre-operative - ward admittance preparation operation - Intra-operative - operation - Post-operative - recovery operation - Rehabilitation - optimise recovery function - Discharge - return home appropriate residence These pathway base upon evidence-based , documented national internationally expert guideline subject frequent clinical review . A key co-morbidity recognise cognitive impairment describe clinical outcome PwD significantly bad non-cognitively impaired patient . Following National Guidelines Dementia Care ( Department Health 2009a ) acute hospital Trusts implement general dementia care strategy throughout hospital . Given proportion patient dementia sustain hip fracture increase year year , expert ( McGilton et al 2013 ) suggest subgroup patient dementia hip fracture specific treatment pathway , acknowledge clear difference presentation care need . Developing ERP specifically patient dementia hip-fracture precise objective overall PERFECTED research programme . The PERFECTED research programme The PERFECTED ( Peri-operative Enhanced Recovery hip FracturE Care paTiEnts Dementia ) research programme award Dr Chris Fox ( UEA ) November 2013 . This 5 year project fund National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) Programme Grant Applied Research initiative . For summary accept research proposal please see annex 1 . The overall aim PERFECTED improve hospital care PwD admit fractured hip . The research first develop examine feasibility , acceptability potential clinical cost effectiveness optimise `` enhanced recovery pathway '' ( ERP ) patient . The PERFECTED programme structure 4 Work Packages ( WPs ) ; primary aim follow : - WP1 : establish best practice define ERP patient hip fracture dementia acute hospital . - WP2 : determine staff train cultural/organisational change require implement maximise adherence aforementioned ERP . - WP3 : undertake pilot study assess clinical cost effectiveness ERP inform design future definitive Randomised Controlled Trial . - WP4 : disseminate data lesson learn programme develop definitive trial proposal . This protocol relate phase 3 WP1 . This specific phase observational study involve researcher observe care delivery specify ortho-geriatric ward Norfolk Norwich University Hospital ( NNUH ) , Queen 's Medical Centre ( QMC ) Nottingham Bradford Royal Infirmary ( BRI ) . Observations also take place Emergency Department ( ED ) hospital opportunistic basis . Observations occur site intermittently 4-week period sequentially cover full 24h cycle . That , 4 week observation NNUH , move BRI observe 4 week , finish undertake 4 week observation QMC . Data elicit observation address study 's research aim also inform wider aim WP1 describe context ( include cost consequence ) care delivery hospital patient hip fracture , dementia . It essential emphasise although PERFECTED overall ( include WP1 ) concern old hip-fracture patient dementia , phase 3 WP1 ( observational study ) concern old hip-fracture patient general . As research programme PERFECTED iterative . To create one total ethical protocol would feasible . We submit numerous protocol line programme 's development . The aim , procedure ethical consideration associate phase 3 WP1 , observational study , sole objective protocol .</detailed_description>
