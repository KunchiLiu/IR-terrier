	<brief_title>First Study Oral Cysteamine Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) common fatal inherited disease Caucasian population European origin . The morbidity mortality associate CF result chronic suppurative lung disease . The lungs people CF chronically infect bacteria cause chronic infection acute period worsen infection know exacerbation . Many bacteria infect patient CF intrinsically resistant many antibiotic bacterial antibiotic resistance increase , addition many pathogenic bacteria grow biofilms contributes antibiotic resistance . The aggressive use antibiotic suppress chronic infection treat acute exacerbation one mainstays treatment CF contribute increase survival CF patient . However , problem multiple drug resistance adverse reaction major clinical issue . This lead call research new antibiotic new antibiotic strategy target biofilm increase effectiveness currently available antibiotic . Cysteamine license drug use treatment cystinosis 20 year . Laboratory base work suggest cysteamine may beneficial adjunct conventional antibiotic treatment CF . Cysteamine potent mucolytic , disrupts biofilms , antimicrobial , synergises antibiotic agent , broaden spectrum activity , deliver post-antimicrobial effect reverse antibiotic resistance ( even multi-drug resistant bacteria ) . Although pharmacokinetic characteristic cysteamine well establish people cystinosis , data cysteamine CF . CF characterise malabsorption know whether cysteamine absorb CF , furthermore know cysteamine enters bronchial secretion . It possible assume pharmacokinetics cysteamine patient CF report cystinosis . Hypothesis : Oral cysteamine absorb vascular space bronchial secretion administration people Cystic Fibrosis . Objectives : characterise pharmacokinetic profile cysteamine people CF , ascertain whether cysteamine enters bronchial secretion tolerability cysteamine patient CF . Method : single centre , single group open label investigation tolerability pharmacokinetics oral cysteamine ( Cystagon ) administer patient Cystic Fibrosis dose license use cystinosis . Setting : adult CF clinic , Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . Target population : 12 patient age ≥18years CF associate lung disease clinically stable . Intervention : recommended cystinosis , patient maintain normal CF medication . Oral cysteamine ( Cystagon ) increase 450mg od 450mg qds three week , remain 450mg qds two week . Assessment : face face health outcome assessment carry participant recruitment/baseline , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 6 week . Serial blood cysteamine level measure first 24 hour first dose . Sputum cysteamine quantify two week full dose cysteamine 450mg qds . Disease specific health status ( CFQ-R ) assess baseline two week full dose . At assessment , lung function ( FEV1 , FVC ) , adverse reaction serious adverse event ascertain . Blood sample take measurement haematological biochemical parameter recognise , rare side effect cysteamine . Sputum sample assessment analyse microbiologically ( quantitative , antibiotic sensitivity rheology ) ass effect cysteamine sputum microbiology , sputum collect prior first dose use develop laboratory base method quantify cysteamine sputum .</detailed_description>
