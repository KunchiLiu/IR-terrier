	<brief_summary>Progress treatment myeloma myeloma bone disease substantially increase overall survival , relapse inevitable well treatment need . The bone microenvironment tremendously complex , target single interaction tumor bone unlikely effective . Treatments need block centrally important , multifunctional pathway . The investigator data point central role osteocyte induce heparanase , multifunctional mediator myeloma bone disease . Increased heparanase due FGF23 may make systemic inhibitor heparanase less effective bone elsewhere . FGF23 neutralize antibody develop non-cancer condition FGF23 excess , chronic kidney disease ( Shimada &amp; Fukamoto , 2012 ) , could use MM alone combination heparanase inhibitor . Complete neutralization FGF23 adverse effect , neutralization FGF23 excess may practical , future , suppression excess FGF23 biosynthesis osteocyte . The investigator hope determine serum FGF23 heparanase , Dkk1 plasma klotho level patient newly diagnose relapse myeloma compare healthy control exploratory study .</brief_summary>
