	<brief_title>Assessment Tolerance Mobilizing Peripheral Hematopoietic Stem Cells Plerixafor Sickle Cell Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease genetic disorder cause point mutation cod region gene beta-globin consequence production abnormal ( betas-globin ) . This mutation responsible polymerization deoxygenate HbS chain . Polymers make red blood cell ( RBC ) rigid , change shape responsible structural lesion membrane , alter rheological property RBC alter blood flow microcirculation . The two ultimate consequence change intravascular haemolysis occurrence vaso-occlusive episode . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation curative treatment patient , 25 % HLA-genoidentical family donor . In absence compatible donor , gene therapy model autograft could valid alternative . However , gene therapy curative treatment sickle cell disease require optimal number genetically modify HSC reinject patient . In contrast beta-thalassemia patient , mobilization HSC peripheral blood growth factor G-CSF patient sickle cell trigger vaso-occlusive crisis . The onset action plerixafor fast . In pharmacodynamic study healthy volunteer , mobilization peak CD34 + cell observe 6 9 hour administration plerixafor . One injection per day 1 2 day sufficient achieve optimal collection ( unlike 5-6 day require mobilization HSC G-CSF use growth factor ) . The duration exposure risk thereby theoretically reduce . We propose drug test - Phase I/II trial - monocenter- non-comparative - randomize - uncontrolled - Open . In protocol , propose ass safety efficacy peripheral HSC mobilization three major sickle cell patient ( SS Sbeta thalassemia ) ( five , result first 3 patient reproducible ) single injection plerixafor significant decrease HbS rate . Adequate number CD34 + cell collect key point success possible subsequent autologous graft genetically modify HSC ; dose &gt; 3.106 cell / kg CD34 + necessary . Mobilized collected cell store possible future gene therapy handle backup graft . These three patient include sequentially ; new inclusion take place serious adverse event occur patient participate trial . Recruitment take place consultation Apheresis Therapeutic Unit / Department Biotherapy Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital . Patients recruit cohort adult sickle cell disease Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades , principal investigator see patient consultation week precede decision propose take part research . This consultation constitute within framework protocol , prior medical examination . Before plerixafor injection , patient subject one red cell exchange order reduce post-transfusion HbS rate le 30 % possible around 15 % . If patient treatment hydroxyurea , stop 3 month collect peripheral HSC replace exchange transfusion rhythm per month . If patient treatment hydroxyurea , 2 3 exchange transfusion month collect peripheral HSC . Treatment plerixafor administer Adult Intensive Care Unit Necker - Enfants malades Hospital . He/She scope , receive oxygen therapy hyperhydration ( physiological saline per day ) ; his/her ionogram phosphatemia monitor . The procedure mobilization collection apheresis peripheral HSC perform haematologist doctor specialist nurse . The HSC 's collection make Apheresis Therapeutic Unit . A member LTCG team retrieve sample intensive care provide transport laboratory possible transformation . The patient remain hospitalized collection peripheral HSC condition treatment monitoring ( scope , oxygen , hyperhydration ) number White Blood Cells remain low 10x10^9 / L new income count base . HSB 's collection relate hospitalisation perform accord JACIE ( Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-EBMT ) program subsequent Standard Operating Procedures force Clinical Unit Laboratory Cell Gene Therapy ( LTCG ) Department Biotherapy . The dispensation treatment perform Internal Use Pharmacy ( PUI ) Necker-Enfants malades Hospital . Specific prescription plerixafor study make available investigator . A total 15 visit patient hydroxyurea screening , 12 visit patient without hydroxyurea ( include final visit ) schedule trial . The total study duration 24 month , duration inclusion 14 month . The data require analysis study report paper case report form .</detailed_description>
