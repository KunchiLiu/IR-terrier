	<detailed_description>Our proposal represent convergence several recent development treatment patient low-risk carcinoma breast . For select subset patient low-risk disease , appear intra-operative radiotherapy single fraction lead acceptable clinical outcome term local control , overall survival toxicity . There also Phase I dose escalation trial demonstrate safety single fraction breast radiation . In study , propose delivery radiotherapy use single fraction , 21 Gy , use stereotactic body radiation therapy . Radiation deliver use Volumetric-modulated arc therapy ( VMAT ) , plan coregistered PET/MRI CT imaging , deliver prone . Our approach potentially numerous benefit , include significantly shorten treatment time , convenience potentially reduce health care cost . It would significantly improve quality life many patient . This study also provide unique opportunity pathologic assessment impact radiation microscopic level tumour marker without confound impact systemic treatment , compare pre- post-radiation biopsy specimens image histologic predictor radiation sensitivity .</detailed_description>
