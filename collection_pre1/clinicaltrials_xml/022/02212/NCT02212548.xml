	<brief_title>Prostate-Rectal Separation With PEG Hydrogel Its Effect Decreasing Rectal Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer Northern Sydney Cancer Centre radiotherapy treatment prostate cancer screen initial consultation suitability participation study . Following informed consent , agree participate study undergo follow procedure . Blood test perform ensure normal coagulation profile renal function prior procedure . Under transrectal ultrasound guidance , patient insertion fiducial gold seed prostate anaesthesia . While patient theatre anaesthesia , PEG hydrogel ( SpaceOAR ) insert Dr Thomas Eade , competent procedure . The patient dorsal lithotomy position prepare draped . A transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) use alignment needle ensure safe delivery . The hydrogel precursor accelerator solution mixed connect Y connector flush saline syringe holder ensure syringe barrel inject time ( come commercial product ) . The solution inject within 30 minute mix . After aspirate ensure tip needle intravascular , perirectal space adequately dissect apex midgland inject saline space denonvilliers fascia anterior rectal space TRUS guidance . This hydrodissection , prior delivery hydrogel , create distance 3-4 mm prostate rectum . Maintaining needle position angulation , saline syringe disconnect hydrogel system connect . After aspirate ensure needle tip blood vessel TRUS guidance , hydrogel inject smooth , continuous technique . The gel set within approximately 8 second . In order compare effect PEG hydrogel ( SpaceOAR ) dose radiation receive rectum , two radiotherapy plan create . One planning CT scan therefore perform prior injection PEG hydrogel one one week follow injection hydrogel . The two treatment plan create radiation therapist . As hydrogel clearly visible MRI CT scan , obtain pelvic MRI scan follow injection hydrogel.. The MRI scan use plan fuse plan CT scan aid voluming . Treatment : Patients undergo standard prostate cancer planning treatment use image guide dose escalate IMRT per RNSH Department protocol guideline dose 80Gy 40 fraction 14 . Rectal Dose Analysis : Two plan dose-volume histogram create , one use plan CT scan prior PEG hydrogel ( SpaceOAR ) injection one use plan CT MRI perform one week post hydrogel injection . MRI scan obtain day CT simulation use bladder fill rectal emptying protocol . Each patient two plan create Radiation Therapist . This allow comparison 2 plan . The patient treat accord post PEG hydrogel injection plan , initial plan comparison purpose . The volume rectum receive 80Gy , 75Gy , 70Gy , 65Gy , 60Gy , 40Gy , 35Gy 25Gy compare two plan . Patient assessment : Patients assess immediately post injection hydrogel , 24hrs later telephone 1 week later telephone determine adverse event relate PEG hydrogel ( SpaceOAR ) injection . This include question regard pain discomfort , infection , bleeding , change bowel bladder function . Information every adverse event collect recorded appropriate case report form . Adverse event describe duration ( start end date ) , severity grade , action take . A follow-up report follow initial report within 5 working day . Any report adverse event resolve time follow resolution event become chronic statement make effect . During radiotherapy treatment patient assess weekly clinic toxicity record use modify RTOG National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria ( v4.0 ) adverse event . Patients review clinic 3 month , 9 month , 15 month 21 month post completion treatment rectal toxicity assess use modify RTOG National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria ( v4.0 ) adverse event . Adverse event : An adverse event undesirable experience associate use medical product patient . All adverse event appropriately report duration ( start end date ) , severity grade , action take appropriate case report form . Grade 1 mild event easily tolerate . Grade 2 moderate event cause enough discomfort interfere usual activity . Grade 3 severe event result inability carry usual activity . Grade 4 event life threaten disable . The serious adverse event document medically assessed investigator . As PEG hydrogel remove follow injection , patient treat medically symptomatically . A follow-up report follow initial report within 5 working day . Any report adverse event resolve time follow resolution event become chronic statement make effect .</detailed_description>
