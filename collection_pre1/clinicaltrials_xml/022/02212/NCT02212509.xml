	<brief_title>Functional Recovery After Cardiac Surgery : Does Delirium Calorie Intake Matter ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Taiwan , 54.2 % cardiac surgical procedure 2010 perform old patient ( ≧65 year ) high rate surgical complication , functional decline , even death report . Despite large number old patient undergo cardiac surgery goal improve functional capacity , literature area limit . Specifically , little information functional outcome 1 year cardiac surgery old patient . A prospective , longitudinal cohort study conduct assess follow patient age 65 year old undergoing elective non-elective cardiac surgery one year surgery . All patient cardio-surgical ward 5A , 5B , 5CVI National Taiwan University Hospital screen eligibility . Every patient ≧65 year admit cardiac surgery approach invited participate . This cohort study aim 1 ) describe rate 30-day surgical complication , functional decline , frailty , one-year mortality old patient underwent cardiac surgery ; 2 ) delineate rajectory functional capacity 1 year surgery patient ; 3 ) test whether trajectory functional capacity vary significantly accord delirium status type one-year follow-up period ; 4 ) examine patient ' postsurgical actual caloric/protein/fluid intake relation functional capacity within 3 month surgery ; 5 ) evaluate hether activity level , dietary diversity , depressive symptom 3 , 6 , 12 month affect patient outcome . Estimated 236 participant enrol ensure power study . Data analyze use SAS package . The Generalized Estimating Equation ( GEE ) perform identify risk factor delineate trajectory functional capacity 1 year cardiac surgery old patient . The finding add development nursing intervention program promote functional recovery old patient cardiac surgery</detailed_description>
