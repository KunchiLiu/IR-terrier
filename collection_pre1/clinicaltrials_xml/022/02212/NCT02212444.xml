	<brief_summary>Plantar fasciitis ( severe pain heel ) common problem significant impact quality life . There evidence support use orthoses stretch conservative management plantar fasciitis current orthotic management may optimal . More prolonged stretching night splint may achieve good result splint clinically well tolerate . Therefore , potential need apply prolonged stretch day dynamic task walk . This lead development rigid semi-rigid splint show promising result small scale clinical trial . There disadvantage however rigid bracing orthoses see type splint . For example , often difficult accommodate person 's available shoe ; particularly difficult woman thus limit compliance intervention . Further , rigid brace uncomfortable fast walking run limit participation activity . Recently novel orthotic , customised dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses ( DEFO ) , develop . Being make lycraÂ® base material sock-like splint lightweight discrete , allow accommodate easily shoe type potentially well tolerate worn night compare currently available splint . Its design allow use comfortably dynamic task walk run support initial anecdotal evidence athlete . To date evaluation effectiveness DEFO general population plantar fasciitis . This study look feasibility conducting randomise control trial use DEFO compare off-the-shelf orthoses adjunct usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plantar fasciitis common foot ankle pathology affect general population . It affect 1 million people USA equate ~0.2 million UK . It characterize severe pain felt plantar aspect heel around plantar fascia origin significantly thick normal . Usually conservative treatment comprise referral physiotherapy provision orthotics . Physiotherapy consist teach home program calf plantar fascia stretch addition weight management footwear advice . Orthotic management include provision off-the-shelf orthotics customise orthotics . Some study customise orthoses demonstrate significant improvement foot pain related function 3 12 month people plantar fasciitis compare sham intervention . However , systematic review randomise controlled trial find evidence support use short long term foot pain , pain related function disability . Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses ( DEFOs ) successfully use variety patient group . The plantar fasciitis DEFOs custom-made close-fitting sock elastomeric construction . It wear next skin sock exert external torsional , compressive , supportive effect , thus positively influence biomechanics heal .</detailed_description>
