	<brief_title>Repeated-Dose Oral N-acetylcysteine Treatment Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator interested evaluate use oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) therapy Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) measuring change brain blood chemistry . The investigator ' hypothesis repeat oral dosing NAC result increase brain red blood cell GSH concentration individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) healthy control . The specific aim 1 . ) measure plasma blood ( red blood cell ) glutathione ( GSH ) ratio reduce GSH oxidize glutathione ( GSSG ) individual PD healthy control baseline four week repeat high dos oral NAC ( 6000 mg/day ) 2 ) measure cortical GSH level ( ascertain MRS ) PD healthy control baseline four week repeat high dos oral NAC ( 6000 mg/day ) simultaneously Aim 1 . This study combine information medical history , physical examination , disease rating scale result obtain use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) brain scan pharmacokinetic study blood sample . This research require 2 visit , one baseline one approximately 28 day therapy . Participants provide medical history first visit , undergo physical examination rating scale visit ( duration : 1 hour ) . The first visit include brain scan blood collection require approximately 3 hour time . The brain scan pharmacokinetic study second visit require approximately 8 hour time . In total second visit take roughly 9 hour .</detailed_description>
