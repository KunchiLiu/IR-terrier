	<brief_summary>Late Life Depression ( LLD ) serious health problem cause depress mood also result impairment memory attention . These impairment likely resistant treatment , increase chance develop dementia even successful treatment mood.This study randomize control trial transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) people LLD enhance cognition successful treatment mood establish medication . tDCS non invasive , relatively inexpensive portable , find safe.This study also serve pilot study assess effect tDCS cognition neurophysiologic marker cognition among patient LLD . Primary study hypothesis participant Participants randomize tDCS perform well work memory task 2 week 3 month follow tDCS course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Enhance Cognition Late Life Depression Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation method utilizes low intensity electrical current either increase cortical excitability anodal electrode suppress cortical excitability cathodal electrode . tDCS produce effect long lasting change neuroplasticity : animal study , tDCS result long-term potentiation brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion ; human study , tDCS result potentiation neurophysiologic marker neuroplasticity . Consistent preclinical finding , tDCS temporoparietal cortex leave DLPFC improves memory patient mild moderate Alzheimer disease ( AD ) . tDCS also test among patient depression - include group - mainly treatment depressive symptom . In one recent large study one session bilateral anodal tDCS show enhance work memory among midlife participant major depression prior receive treatment . However , still know ( 1 ) whether tDCS improve cognition beyond partial improvement associate resolution depressive symptom ; ( 2 ) whether fundamental long lasting effect cognition . This trial ass acute long-term effect 2-week course daily ( 5 days/week ) bilateral anodal tDCS DLPFC cognition , particular work memory among 36 patient LLD . We recruit randomize participant already treat LLD prior consent study still meet criterion remission antidepressant medication . This trial also use platform explore effect tDCS neurophysiologic measure plasticity work memory performance . Working memory support re-entrant circuit , local within DLPFC others long-range connect DLPFC posterior cortex . These network result high low frequency neuronal oscillation capture electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Using novel neurophysiologic analysis , group others demonstrate modulation high-frequency ( particularly gamma ) oscillation low-frequency ( particularly theta ) oscillations - `` theta-gamma coupling '' - neurophysiologic marker work memory . Thus , explore effect tDCS theta-gamma coupling .</detailed_description>
