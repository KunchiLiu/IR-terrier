	<brief_title>Comparing Outcome Patients Acute Pancreatitis , With Without Prophylactic Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) acute inflammatory condition pancreas may extend local distant extra pancreatic tissue . AP broadly classify mild severe . Most case AP mild excellent recovery . However 15 % 20 % severe . Bacterial infection play vital course disease . Patients AP prone develop extrapancreatic infection like urinary , respiratory systemic infection . These infection may result prolonged hospitalization , systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , multi-organ system failure death . The common cause gallstone alcohol intake . AP manage intravenous fluid , analgesia nothing mouth . However treatment severe pancreatitis challenging , particularly multiple organ system involve local complication . In severe acute pancreatitis , pancreatic enzyme inflammatory mediator damage blood vessel lead extravasation fluid third space . This fluid extravasation lead local pancreatic necrosis end-organ failure . Assessment severity begin emergency room admission . Signs SIRS ( high low core body temperature , tachycardia , tachypnea , low high peripheral white blood cell count ) organ failure ( e.g . elevate serum creatinine ) present admission 21 % patient acute pancreatitis . CT consider 3 day onset symptom rather immediately upon admission . Eighty per cent case AP interstitial mild ; remain 20 % necrotizing severe . The role prophylactic antibiotic acute pancreatitis controversial .A study publish American Journal Gastroenterology show result favour use antibiotic acute pancreatitis . This study show significant reduction length hospitalization patient give prophylactic antibiotic . Other Internationally conduct study suggest insignificant role antibiotic mild acute pancreatitis role prophylactic antibiotic sever acute pancreatitis well clinical outcome controversial say least . Rationale study emphasize prophylactic antibiotic patient acute pancreatitis improve patient 's come term shorter hospital stay , reduce number extrapancreatic infection .</detailed_description>
