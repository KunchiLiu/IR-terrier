	<detailed_description>Dual antiplatelet therapy consist aspirin P2Y12 receptor antagonist cornerstone treatment prevention thrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Prasugrel , third generation thienopyridine , orally administer prodrug need single-step hepatic biotransformation active metabolite irreversibly block P2Y12 receptor . Prasugrel show superior clopidogrel , adjunct aspirin , prevent recurrent ischemic event . Prasugrel approve patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) dosage 60 mg load dose ( LD ) follow 10 mg/day . However , delay onset antiplatelet effect particular set consistently show . The STEMI set characterized condition , impaired absorption hepatic metabolism , patient either intubated , shock unable swallow , may affect pharmacokiÂ¬netic pharmacodynamic effect orally administer antiplatelet drug . The administration clopidogrel ticagrelor crush tablet test faster great bioavailability compare whole tablet observe . However , administration crush prasugrel LD may overcome limitation still unknown represent aim study . The propose investigation prospective , randomize , design STEMI patient undergo primary PCI randomize receive two different formulation prasugrel LD ( 60 mg whole tablet 60 mg crush tablet ) . Pharmacodynamic test perform several time point test study hypothesis crush LD regiment achieve prompt enhance platelet inhibitory effect . This study provide insight pharmacodynamic effect crush prasugrel LD help clinician choose appropriate treatment avoid complication related inadequate platelet inhibition early phase patient STEMI undergo primary PCI .</detailed_description>
