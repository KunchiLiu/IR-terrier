	<brief_summary>The investigator overarch aim obtain preliminary data support large grant validate novel objective , physiologically-based outcome measure clinical trial autism spectrum disorder ( ASDs ) call cortical metric . Absence outcome measure greatly hinder development treatment core symptom ASD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cortical Metrics Intervention Trials With Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cortical metric single numeric measurement calculate use multi-parametric mathematical approach series measurement speed , intensity , diameter , distance two vibration person react distinguish vibration small brush touch top side finger leave hand multiple condition design elicit cortical adaptation The cortical metric base neurobiological principle nerve fingertips project adjacent group neuron work together continuously optimize perception touch varying condition . Such perceptual optimization reflect shift excitatory inhibitory action individual neuron . We hypothesize brain 's processing vibration similar processing kind information . We also hypothesize people ASD adjacent group neuron work together less well process information . Specific Aim 1 : Obtain evidence regard ability `` cortical metric '' distinguish 8-12 year-olds typical development high functioning autism spectrum disorder ( ASDs ) . Hypothesis 1 : The cortical metric child ASD differ age match , typically develop child . This difference consistent low normal local functional connectivity . Specific Aim 2 : Validate test-retest reliability cortical metric examine stability average 3 week intervene intervention group child . Hypothesis 2 : Test-retest reliability highly correlate group child . Specific Aim 3 : Obtain preliminary proof mechanism data cortical metric ass excitatory : inhibitory balance intra-cortical connection examine effect acute exposure dextromethorphan ( DXM ) , transiently block one type excitatory neurotransmission Hypothesis 3 : DXM alter cortical metric consistent reduce adaptation . The completion aim essential design large federally fund trial validate cortical metric outcome measure heterogeneous pediatric ASD sample . Specifically , aim demonstrate 1 ) cortical metric differs child ASD normal development , 2 ) cortical metric minimal variability time absence fno major change brain function , 3 ) cortical metric change response specific , temporary reduction excitatory stimulation cause single DXM dose . A large grant could focus determine sensitive clinically relevant change cortical metric . If able demonstrate potential cortical metric change agent reduce excitatory stimulation acutely variability cortical metric 3 week great , examination cortical metric outcome measure ASD trial would pursue . If difference cortical metric child without ASD , would less interested examine cortical metric .</detailed_description>
