	<brief_title>Differentiation Pseudoprogression True Progression Through High Field Susceptibility Weighted Imaging R2*</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-treatment radiographic image change ( PTRIC ) see approximately 50 % patient treat brain neoplasm use chemotherapy radiotherapy . PTRIC attribute true disease progression form benign radiographic enhancement , know literature pseudoprogression . Of patient , 50 % benign radiographic enhancement usually spontaneously resolve require intervention . The 50 % require immediate medical intervention , aggressive treatment true progression . Currently standard medical practise administer prophylactic treatment chemotherapy patient PTRIC follow scan 3-6 month initial PTRIC diagnosis , lead 50 % patient receive unneeded dose chemotherapy . The investigator hope take advantage differentiation tissue type vascularization true progression tumour pseudoprogression able identify patient would need administer prophylactic dose chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
