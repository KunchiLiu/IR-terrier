	<brief_title>A Randomised , Open-label , Three-way Crossover Study Assess Pharmacokinetics Safety Single Doses Four Sprays Sativex® Range Oral pH Environments Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , randomise , open-label , three-way crossover study assess effect oral pH PK Sativex . Subjects receive follow treatment random order across three residential treatment visit : - Treatment A ( acidic oral pH ) : Sativex ( four spray ) pre-treatment Coca-Cola ; - Treatment B ( neutral oral pH ) : Sativex ( four spray ) pre-treatment tap water ; - Treatment C ( alkaline oral pH ) : Sativex ( four spray ) pre-treatment oral suspension magnesium hydroxide ( milk magnesia ) . The target pH treatment determine result pilot study . Each dose administration separate least seven day . Study subject participate total five study visit .</detailed_description>
