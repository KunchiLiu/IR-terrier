	<brief_summary>The aim project document central peripheral mechanism , may predict clinical pain characteristic associated physical performance old adult . Although chronic pain common among old adult , limit understanding processing pain mechanisms affect physical function individual . The first aim study examine predictor clinical pain old adult . These include comprehensive somatosensory assessment battery include mechanical thermal detection pain threshold old adult without chronic pain . The investigator also assess basal cognitive physical function determine association chronic pain . Finally , brain structure function assess old adult without pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain , Brain Mobility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study learn pain old individual change brain impact person 's mobility function . Pain influenced biology ( like hormone ) , psychology ( thoughts feeling ) , habit ( like sleep exercise ) may make old adult likely high low level pain .</detailed_description>
