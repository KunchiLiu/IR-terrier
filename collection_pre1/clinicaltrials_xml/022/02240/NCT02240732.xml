	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND In 2012 76,497 primary total knee ( TKR ) replacement perform England , Wales Northern Ireland . Traditionally TKR surgery undertaken aid surgical tourniquet . A surgical tourniquet occlusive device apply around patient 's leg . The tourniquet squeeze leg ( include blood vessel within leg ) therefore reduce amount bleeding occurs inflate . An intraoperative tourniquet therefore help improve surgical field view . Although majority surgeon prefer undertake TKR surgery use tourniquet small increase number pursue device . There robust evidence risk deep vein thrombosis increase tourniquet use TKR surgery . In addition embolic material venous system observe follow TKR surgery note present right atrium transoesophageal ( TOE ) echo intra-operatively . , Significant potentially life threaten embolus document enter cerebral circulation via pulmonary arterio-venous shunt patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) ( 27 % patient autopsy ) , . The clinical manifestation cerebral embolus post tourniquet deflation TKR fully understood . Fat embolism syndrome post-operative confusion TKR patient may result embolus form TKR . , AIM - Is evidence emboli enter cerebral circulation follow tourniquet deflation TKR surgery ? - Is evidence MRI detectable brain lesion clinical change cognition compare patient undergo TKR surgery tourniquet compare tourniquet ?</brief_summary>
