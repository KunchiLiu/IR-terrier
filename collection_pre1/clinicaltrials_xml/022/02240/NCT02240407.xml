	<brief_summary>A recombinant AAV vector generate carry codon-optimized acid alpha-glucosidase ( coGAA ) gene express human desmin enhancer/promoter ( DES ) . The proposed clinical trial within-participant , double-blind , randomize , phase I control study evaluate toxicology , biodistribution potential activity re-administration rAAV9-DES-hGAA inject intramuscularly TA . Nine participant ( 18 year old old ) Late-Onset Pompe Disease ( LOPD ) include . The goal immune modulation strategy ablate B-cells ( Rituximab Sirolimus ) prior initial exposure study agent one leg subsequent exposure vector contralateral leg four month . At study agent dosing , contralateral leg receive excipient . Patients act control . Repeated measure , baseline follow 3 month injection , assess safety , biochemical functional impact vector .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolling study entail participate 8 month study-related visit . Patients ask come Clinical Translational Research Building University Florida series onsite study visit , include baseline visit , two injection gene transfer two post-injection visit . All visit , include injection , last two day perform outpatient procedure Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) facility University Florida . Overnight observation need , however , patient ask stay overnight hotel near University Florida . During first 4 month injection , patient ask perform outpatient laboratory work laboratory facility convenient . In addition , study patient ask take medication modulate ability immune system react foreign agent include gene transfer agent . The purpose medication improve activity GAA within body . Patients need take one medication ( Rituximab ) 15 day prior first injection study agent day injection . Rituximab repeat 2nd injection his/her body produce antibody ( B cell count ) . Rituximab deliver infusion may last 2-6 hour . Patients need take another medication ( Sirolimus ) every day start 3 day first injection study agent one month second injection study agent . The following discus occur visit : Baseline Baseline Evaluation first Rituximab infusion - Day -15/-14 - Medical history : Patients ask complete questionnaire his/her medical history . - Blood urine test : These test use evaluate safety gene transfer agent . - Quantitative Muscle Testing ( QMT ) : This test find strong patient 's leg muscle . - Balance test : Balance test Nintendo Wii-fit board , acquire oscillation patient 's body stand position . - Gait analysis : Gait test Gait Mat II , record spatial temporal parameter his/her walk cadence , speed distance foot . - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Spectroscopy ( MRS ) : MRI MRS test do inside large magnet let study doctor measure size health patient 's muscle . These test do time . MRI MRS test require patient stay still hour . - Muscle Biopsy : Tissue sample obtain used evaluation muscle glycogen GAA activity inject muscle . - Magnetic stimulation common fibular nerve : The common fibular nerve , nerve control injected muscle , stimulate magnetic field test impact gene transfer agent nervous system . - Single-fiber Electromyography ( EMG ) : Single-fiber EMG test consist introduce small record needle muscle record activity muscle fiber stimulation voluntary contraction . - The patient receive first Rituximab infusion . It might last 2 6 hour . Rituximab infusion 1st Injection - Day 0/1 - The patient receive 2nd Rituximab infusion day gene transfer agent . It might last 2 6 hour . He/she receive gene transfer agent 1 injection ( total 1 teaspoon ) tibialis anterior ( TA ) muscle one leg . The leg receive pharmacologically inactive solution . An ultrasound use detect proper location injection . A photograph injection injection site may take . If patient agrees , he/she ask sign consent form procedure . Outpatient lab work - Day 5/15/30/60 - Blood urine test Onsite visit - Day 89/90 - Medical history - Blood urine test - Quantitative Muscle Testing ( QMT ) - Balance test - Gait analysis - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Spectroscopy ( MRS ) - Muscle Biopsy - Magnetic stimulation common fibular nerve - Single-fiber EMG Rituximab infusion 2nd Injection - Day 120/121 - The patient receive 3nd Rituximab infusion day gene transfer agent his/her body produce antibody ( B cell count ) . It might last 2 6 hour . The patient receive second gene transfer agent injection leg previously receive inactive solution . The leg previously receive study agent receive inactive solution . The injection procedure amount study agent inject first injection . Outpatient lab work - Day 125/ 135/ 150/ 180 - Blood urine test Onsite visit - Day 209/210 - Blood urine test - Quantitative Muscle Testing ( QMT ) - Balance test - Gait analysis - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Spectroscopy ( MRS ) - Muscle Biopsy - Magnetic stimulation common fibular nerve - Single-fiber EMG</detailed_description>
