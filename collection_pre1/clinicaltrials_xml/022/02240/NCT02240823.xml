	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common cancer among Danish men , incidence increase . Studies show high number need treat saved prostate cancer relate death . After prostatectomy , 80 % experience erectile dysfunction . Sexual life central part people 's identity , self-esteem quality life . Stem cell generate large amount promise data suggest stem cell alleviate erectile dysfunction , regenerate nerve well endothelial smooth muscle cell corpus cavernous . Animal study use stem cell therapy improve erectile dysfunction rat cavernous nerve damage , invariable high success rate . In pilot study include 30 patient 's erectile dysfunction 3-9 mdr prostatectomy . The men spontaneous erectile function response drug treatment . Liposuction carry general anesthesia . Isolation stem cell do simultaneously stem cell inject corpus cavernous directly isolation carry . This clinical study evaluate innovative cell therapy procedure.The objective study evaluate effect injection stem cell adipose origin . The project run period twelve month . Patients follow period six month . Treatment efficacy assess validated questionnaire .</detailed_description>
