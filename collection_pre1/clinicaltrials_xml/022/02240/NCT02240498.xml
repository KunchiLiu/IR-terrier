	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Study Methylene Blue Photodynamic Therapy Sterilize Deep Tissue Abscess Cavities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep tissue abscess remain significant cause morbidity , mortality , hospital stay despite improved surgical technique increase use perioperative antibiotic . Mortality range 80-100 % undrained collection , patient intraperitoneal abscess , report hospital stay 21-47 day . The development image-guided percutaneous drainage accompany antimicrobial treatment show improve patient outcomes significantly reduce mortality uncomplicated fluid collection 5 % morbidity 10-15 % . Even favorable condition , use long-term antibiotic increase risk acquire resistance incidence polymicrobial infection , may limit future option antibiotic treatment . Further , 23 % patient , percutaneous drainage intravenous antibiotic fail , require open surgical drainage , particularly patient abscess infect yeast abscess due pancreatic process . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , exert antimicrobial activity generation reactive oxygen specie , may serve useful adjunct current standard care treat deep tissue abscesses reduce microbial burden follow drainage . Recent work group demonstrate effectiveness methylene blue photodynamic therapy ( MB-PDT ) organism within primary aspirate fluid obtain 32 patient underwent image-guided percutaneous drainage abscess cavity . We find MB-PDT effective multiple class organisms , include yeast displaying drug resistance . In complex sample , find evidence resistance MB-PDT . These preclinical result obtain sample harvest kind abscess propose treat provide compel rationale evaluate technical feasibility safety advance optical fiber catheter abscess cavity perform PDT time drainage . This clinical strategy would offer wide range potential health benefit patient deep tissue abscess . Among advantage reduce surgical intervention , decrease spread infection , shorten course post-treatment antibiotic therapy , decrease selective pressure antibiotic resistance . Ultimately , would promote early recovery , shorten hospital stay , lead low overall health care cost patient undergo image-guided percutaneous abscess drainage . Image guide percutaneous drainage perform University Rochester use CT , ultrasound , fluoroscopy . Focused image perform , confirm collection amenable drainage . The site prepare draped usual sterile fashion . The overlie skin anesthetize 1 % lidocaine . A Hawkins/micropuncture needle insert , location confirm image guidance . The needle advanced placement within collection confirm image . Syringe aspiration abscess material collect sent gram stain culture . The needle exchange dilator 018 wire replace Coon 's wire . If abscess collection contain multiple loculations , end Coon 's wire use break loculations . The tract dilate transitional dilator follow placement appropriate size All Purpose Draining Locking pigtail catheter ( 8-14 French ) fluid collection . The abscess drain aspiration syringe . The catheter secure skin use 2-0 silk stat-lock , dress appropriately connect drainage bag . After drainage , cavity flush sterile saline per routine procedure . Following , use catheter , cavity fill sterile , clinical grade methylene blue solution dilute 10-fold stock concentration 10 mg/mL . The volume introduce matched cavity volume , estimate exceed 270 mL . This dose within therapeutic range use methylene blue . In unlikely case entire methylene blue dose escape systemic circulation , result full body dose 3.85 mg/kg typical patient weight 70 kg . This range adverse event report methylene blue . After 10-minute incubation interval , methylene blue solution aspirate cavity flush twice sterile saline . The cavity fill sterile 1 % Intralipid solution gently distend cavity , efficient light scatter , homogenize light dose wall cavity . A sterile , FDA-approved optical fiber advanced approximate center abscess cavity via catheter image guidance . The proximal end fiber couple output diode laser system emit light 665 nm , methylene blue activate optimally . Laser power deliver cavity constant fluence rate wall 10 - 20 milliWatts ( mW ) cm-2 . The laser power require obtain desired fluence rate wall calculate documented write form procedure room base abscess size , total laser power range 1-2 W. The diode laser system use capable measure optical power , use directly measure output optical fiber treat patient . These fluence rate within appropriate range effective photodynamic therapy well intensity modest thermal effect observe tissue . Immediately laser irradiation , Intralipid solution aspirate cavity flush sterile saline . Fluence escalation accomplish systematically incrementing duration laser exposure accord `` 3 + 3 '' dose escalation scheme . Under design , first three patient receive 5 minute exposure laser light . If dose-limiting toxicity encounter , exposure duration increase 5 minute next group three patient . If one dose-limiting toxicity encounter , next group patient receive exposure duration previous group . If two dose-limiting toxicity encounter , exposure de-escalated 5 minute . This process continue maximum number patient treat , 6 patient treat de-escalated dose . In order avoid excessive increase procedure duration , maximum duration laser exposure 30 minute . A dose-limiting toxicity define diminished clinical condition , evidence one following : ( ) evidence fat embolism ; ( ii ) evidence nephropathy ; ( iii ) image evidence clinically significant , therapy-induced disruption abscess wall damage surround tissue . Antibiotics prescribe subject 's primary team administer procedure continue post-procedure . These select ensure adequate coverage take account subject allergy . Such administration consider standard care , serve reduce rate post-procedure sepsis . The subject also administer intravenous antiemetic need prior procedure nausea . Following procedure per routine care , combination IV PO antibiotic continue reduce rate post procedure sepsis . Antiemetics also continue need reduce symptom nausea vomit . Narcotics prescribed administer control pain symptom . If subject inpatient time drainage , he/she remain hospitalized post-procedure . If subject outpatient time drainage , he/she admit hospital post-procedure per routine interventional radiology ( IR ) care . The PI another medically-qualified Investigator visit subject daily discharge ass progress adverse event ( AEs ) . The subject 's clinical course discuss daily primary clinical team . Subjects discharge base upon response drainage clinical course , within 48 hour drainage clinical indicator ( white blood cell count , heart rate , blood pressure , temperature ) stable . Following discharge hospital , PI follow subject daily telephone 7 day follow procedure . Additionally , interventional radiology attend physician available phone 24 hour , 7 day week . After subject discharge , see one week follow procedure assess progress , AEs abscess resolution . As per departmental protocol procedure , abscess resolve day 7 evidence catheter output le 20 cc daily limit image abscess cavity , drainage catheter remove . If abscess persists beyond 7 day despite drainage , catheter remain place evaluate day 14 . If abscess persists day 7 clinically indicate , additional procedure ( i.e . repeat drain large diameter catheter ) perform . MB-PDT repeat . Abscess resolution determine either ultrasound CT scan outline . Imaging time catheter removal consider standard care . A study visit day 7 post procedure require subject . If catheter leave time , second visit require day 14 . If catheter remove day 7 unresolved AEs , subject study participation end visit . If subject return schedule , visit reschedule convenience . The visit 7 , necessary , 14 day post procedure primarily determine time catheter removal standard care follow percutaneous drainage . At minimum , complete blood count ( CBC ) w/ diff acquire baseline day 0 , 1 , 2 , blood culture obtain pre-procedure , drainage culture obtain day 0 , serum creatinine measure day 0 , 1 2 . Additional laboratory image study perform deem clinically necessary . There minimal risk systemic skin photosensitivity exposure methylene blue . Based study pharmacokinetics methylene blue , found majority rapidly convert leucomethylene blue , photodynamically inactive . In clinical study MB-PDT MB administer intratumorally , intravesically , via gargling , skin photosensitivity report . Subjects monitor evidence skin photosensitivity reaction procedure . Due rapid conversion MB leucomethylene blue systemic circulation lack photosensitivity previous study , special precaution take limit exposure subject light procedure . The 21 subject enrol study follow clinical finding post image-guided drainage MB-PDT clear . Each subject evaluate image laboratory study schedule visit 7 day post procedure , necessary , 14 day post procedure . It estimate study take approximately 1 year complete .</detailed_description>
