	<brief_title>Wood Stove Interventions Child Respiratory Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rural Native area western United States ( US ) Alaska experience substantial exposure health disparity compare populated urban center . One source disparity elevate inhalation exposure relate use wood stove home heating . Within rural area Montana , Alaska , Navajo Nation , research show residential biomass combustion lead indoor level fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) often exceed current health-based air quality standard . Parallel finding observe several develop country biomass combustion commonly use cook and/or heating . This concerning , PM2.5 exposure associate many adverse health outcome , include great three-fold increase risk acute respiratory tract infection . Throughout world , low respiratory tract infection ( LRTIs ) common cause death child five year age , account 27 % hospitalization among US child five year . Importantly , untoward effect recurrent LRTIs cumulative child recognize risk factor asthma . Currently , global effort reduce indoor biomass smoke exposure develop country . A recent intervention trial find exposure reduction follow introduction improve cookstove protective severe infant pneumonia . Similar evidence-based effort warrant rural Native American community US suffer elevate rate childhood LRTI commonly use wood residential heating . The investigator previously demonstrate community-wide wood stave changeout program ( i.e. , replace old wood stoves new model wood stove ) result reduced wintertime ambient PM2.5 correspond reduction occurrence childhood wheeze respiratory infection . In study , however , inconsistent effect indoor air quality follow introduction new technology wood stove observe . The investigator also show introduction air filtration unit less costly efficacious strategy reduce indoor wood smoke exposure . Nevertheless , energy cost operation need filter replacement ( maintenance ) remain barrier widespread dissemination continue compliance rural economically disadvantaged community . Experience intervention qualitative input wood stove expert suggest educational intervention relate wood stove operation translate low-cost sustainable strategy reduce indoor biomass combustion exposure improve respiratory health . In project , investigator propose test efficacy education-based intervention strategy reduce indoor wood smoke exposures child 's risk LRTI three unique underserved setting . This study three-arm randomize trial wood stave home child less five year old . Education best-burn practice train use simple instrument ( i.e. , stove thermometer wood moisture meter ) introduce one intervention arm ( Tx1 ) . This intervention evaluate indoor air filtration unit arm ( Tx2 ) , well placebo arm ( Tx3 , sham air filter ) . The primary outcome LRTI incidence among child five year age . A sample 324 home , 108 within study area equally assign three intervention arm , allow detection exposure outcome difference within three region . Through three Aims , overall hypothesis low-cost , educational intervention target indoor wood smoke ( PM2.5 ) exposures effective , sustainable strategy reduce child 's risk LRTI underserved Native rural community . Aim 1 : Compare LRTI incidence intervention arm ( Tx1 Tx2 ) LRTI placebo arm ( Tx3 ) . Investigators hypothesize child less five year old intervention home experience low LRTI . Aim 2 : Compare indoor PM2.5 concentration treatment arm relative placebo arm . Investigators hypothesize intervention home low indoor PM2.5 concentration . Aim 3 : Compare effectiveness sustainability treatment strategy relative placebo , within regional site . Investigators hypothesize Tx1 effective sustainable Tx2 . Impact . LRTI important cause morbidity among child , exposure biomass smoke put child great risk LRTI . By reduce in-home wood smoke exposure , study evaluate sustainable evidence-based culturally appropriate strategy decrease occurrence LRTI . In addition , compare effectiveness intervention across three unique rural Native region inform translation study finding diverse setting utilize biomass fuel heat cooking .</detailed_description>
