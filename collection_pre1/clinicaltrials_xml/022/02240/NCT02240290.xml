	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Absorption , Distribution , Break Down Elimination Safety 14C-Labeled Tozadenant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD0026 Phase 1 , single-center , open-label , single-dose study investigate absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ( ADME ) 14C-labeled tozadenant . The primary objective determine mass balance pharmacokinetics ( PK ) total radioactivity 6 healthy male subject follow single oral dose 14C-labeled tozadenant . Secondary objective determine PK Tozadenant , identify quantify metabolite tozadenant , gain information tolerability safety tozadenant . The variable relate radiocarbon activity include total radioactivity concentration whole blood plasma ; total radioactivity excretion urine , feces , expire air ; correspond PK parameter . The concentration correspond PK parameter tozadenant time determine plasma , urine , feces . In addition , metabolites tozadenant identify quantify . The safety tolerability variable include adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , physical examination , standard 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) interval , clinical laboratory result . The study consist Screening Period 20 day ( Days -21 -2 ) Study Period 15 day . Therefore , maximum duration participation Screening discharge clinic subject 35 day .</detailed_description>
