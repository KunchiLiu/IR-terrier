	<brief_summary>The objective C2R promote rapid initiation completion enrollment CREST-2 randomize clinical trial ( clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT02089217 ) . Patients severe symptomatic asymptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease treat carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) perform experienced skilled interventionists . Interventionists ' eligibility determine multi-specialty Interventional Management Committee ( IMC ) . Patient eligibility include patient standard high-risk , symptomatic asymptomatic carotid artery disease . Patients follow occurrence post-procedural complication . The primary safety quality endpoint occurrence stroke death within 30-day period follow stenting procedure . The safety quality result C2R guide selection interventionists participation CREST-2 randomize clinical trial . Enrollment C2R begin 2015 continue publication primary result randomize trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Promote rapid initiation completion enrollment CREST-2 2 . CAS perform experienced operator 3 . Clinical outcome closely monitor 4 . Prevent inappropriate use CAS outside registry Registry Data Collection : The registry leverage exist data-collection infrastructure Society Vascular Surgery 's ( SVS ) Vascular Quality Initiative ( VQI ) American College Cardiology 's ( ACC ) National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR ) . Both organization agree participate effort . The specific logistics data-collection transfer : - The interventionist must pick registry , SVS VQI ACC NCDR enter data . - The interventionist instructs registry transfer de-identified information case C2R . - The case review C2R Management Committee . - Reports case , include whether CREST-2 eligible , maintain . These report allow close monitoring C2R interventionists . - C2R Steering Committee , party ( NINDS , CMS ) inform progress periodically . The registry collect information key co-morbidities limit outcome measure essential , easily use standardized measure commonly part carotid trial , include NIH Stroke Scale Modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) . The 30-day visit conduct face-to-face history , examination test . - DEMOGRAPHICS AND MEDICAL HISTORY : Gender , symptomatic status , carotid artery treat , hypertension , diabetes , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , renal failure . - MONITORING ENROLLMENT : The Registry also collect information feature represent inclusion/exclusion criterion CREST-2 randomize trial . The purpose facilitate monitoring type patient enrol C2R , ensure CREST-2-eligible patient enrol excessively C2R preference CREST-2 . Data- collection , transfer review occur rapidly enough sit comply enrollment limitation identify rapidly appropriate action take . - PROCEDURAL DETAILS : The C2R focus procedural detail facilitate assessment credentialing interventionists CREST-2 trial . The interventional management committee review data make decision regard whether approve particular operator randomize patient trial . Some factor consider include : - Total number case perform per year , total number case perform career - Selection device , case selection , stroke rate , hemorrhagic complication . - Techniques access , sheath placement , wire access , embolic protection , angioplasty , stent deployment , use post-stent angioplasty , selection closure device , use medication ( antiplatelets , anticoagulation , atropine , nitroglycerine ) . - PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND OUTCOMES : NIH Stroke Scale , modify Rankin Score , access site hemorrhage , recurrent hospitalization need second carotid procedure , new onset renal failure , stroke , death . Eligibility participate C2R Centers - Any center currently certify CMS provide CAS eligible apply participation C2R . Operators - Individual operator must do least 50 total procedure eligible registry . If do less 50 procedure , must do least 8 procedure last 2 year . - Individual operator must review approve interventional management committee . - The final decision regard eligibility also depend assessment technique , outcomes anticipate carotid disease volume particular site . Procedures ensure enrollment randomize trial - The maximal enrollment number C2R give site prior randomization CREST-2 total 75 case 30 CREST-2 eligible patient , whichever come first . - Operators credentialed IMC enroll patient CREST-2 must begin enroll eligible patient trial , operator site continue work toward credentialed status . - Sites reach maximum threshold initiate CREST-2 site registry status deny discretion C2R steer committee depend bona fide , good faith effort meet CREST-2 site initiation requirement . - The C2R track whether patient enrol registry CREST-2 eligible . Once operator site approve enroll patient CREST-2 , site expect offer enrollment CREST- 2 every CREST-2 eligible patient . It anticipate CREST-2 eligible patient consent randomization CREST-2 ; patient , enrol registry . However , one CREST-2 eligible patient enrol registry patient enrol CREST-2 , i.e . 1:1 ratio . Patients eligible CREST-2 subject requirement ( though site remains obligated requirement maximal C2R enrollment number prior randomization CREST-2 total 75 case 30 CREST-2 eligible patient , whichever come first ) . - Sites maintain 1:1 ratio patient enrol CREST-2 trial-eligible patient enrol C2R notify C2R Steering Committee 30 day probationary status remedy situation . If remedied , notify C2R status revoke . - Sites enrol CREST-2 reasonable rate ( determine C2R Steering Committee CREST-2 Executive Committee ) eligibility enroll C2R suspend adequately enrol trial . - Once CAS arm CREST-2 fully enrol , continue enrollment eligible patient ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) C2R allow . - The DSMB review CREST-2 trial result end enrollment CREST-2 trial decide time ethical continue C2R . Registry Oversight / Governance The C2R operate multi-specialty Steering Committee . The Steering Committee include member relevant discipline . Representatives CREST-2 , NINDS , CMS member Steering Committee . The Steering Committee shall provide strategic direction C2R , monitor activity , ultimate authority responsibility scientific integrity appropriate use C2R data research publication . Operational responsibility Steering Committee include oversight CAS operator/facility credentialing process well develop improve key aspect registry function . The Steering Committee also discretion modify element protocol change determine necessary successful implementation C2R . The Management Committee carry day-to-day management regulatory responsibility , report Steering Committee . Membership include least one leader surgical , stenting , neurological community . The registry Principal Investigator ( PI ) Brajesh K. Lal , Co-Principal Investigator CREST-2 .</detailed_description>
