The investigator use tDCS stimulate prefrontal cortex . TDCS non-invasive brain stimulation technique modulate brain connectivity . Non-invasive brain neuromodulation combine ( paired-neuromodulation ) training task require top-down control auditory process .

	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation Medication-Resistant Auditory Hallucinations Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25 % schizophrenia ( SZ ) patient report chronic auditory hallucination ( AH ) despite medication . Previous research propose hyperactivity leave temporo-parietal cortex ( 11 ) hypoactivity leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) ( 12 ) associate onset AH . While temporal cortex hyperactivity extensively manipulate neuromodulation intervention try reduce AH , result consistent ( 1,13 ) . Recent transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) work target region apply excitatory stimulation leave DLPFC inhibitory stimulation leave temporo-parietal cortex report 30 % reduction AH patient medication refractory AH last 3 month treatment ( 14 ) . The investigator interested investigate whether use pair neuromodulation ( P-NM ) tDCS co-targeting top-down executive control bottom-up sensory process would result large reduction AH . To date , study use P-NM examine magnitude plasticity executive control sensory processing SZ patient . This type P-NM would relevant since AH think result lack top-down control perceptual distortion internally generate speech . In forced-attention dichotic listening task ( DL ) , two different syllable simultaneously present leave right ear . Subjects require pay attention report either leave right ear stimulus . Due preponderance contralateral pathway , right ear syllable project left temporal lobe processing , leave ear stimulus project right temporal lobe transfer across corpus callosum process leave hemisphere . Healthy control show right ear advantage ( REA ) SZ patient ( 15 ) . DL task performance require top-down control auditory cortex associate increase DLPFC activation control ( 16 ) . Worse performance task associate great severity AH ( 17 ) . SPECIFIC AIMS : The overall aim examine efficacy tDCS intervention combine sensory gate training ( paired neuro-modulation ; P-NM ) reduce hallucination ( measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale ) . The investigator collect pilot data explore magnitude DLPFC plasticity executive control auditory process use P-NM effect hallucination-related behavior . The investigator combine tDCS enhance leave DLPFC activity auditory stimulus present right ear . The investigator use DL task ass plasticity top-down control auditory sensory perception intervention . The investigator correlate DL task performance magnitude leave DLPFC plasticity AH severity . The investigator hypothesize ( ) DLPFC enhancement facilitate REA SZ patient support inhibition attention irrelevant syllable facilitate attention right ear syllable ; ( b ) continue pair left DLPFC activity auditory processing reduce auditory hallucination ( measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale ) . Methods : The investigator recruit 50 SZ patient persistent severe AH despite medication measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale ( AHRS ) . To examine effect P-NM time , patient receive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) five day , twice day practice dichotic listening task ( DL ; Hugdahl 2013 ) . During DL task , patient present consonant-vowel syllable via headphone . The syllable consist paired presentation six stop-consonants /b/ , /d/ , /g/ , /p/ , /t/ , /k/ together vowel /a/ form dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pair type /ba - ga/ , /ta - ka/ etc . The syllable pair possible combination , thus yield 36 dichotic pair , include homonymic pair . Patients give two different instruction . In one instruction condition tell focus attention report right ear , think hear something leave ear , ignore ( `` forced-right '' condition ) . In condition , patient ask focus attention report leave ear , think hear something right ear , ignore ( `` forced-left '' condition ) . Participants receive either active tDCS treatment sham stimulation perform DL task . Half ( n=25 ) receive either ( ) electrical stimulation ( 2mA ) 20 minute leave DLPFC enhance top-down control improve tune gate extraneous information ( b ) half receive sham stimulation control placebo effect . Active tDCS sham tDCS perform tDCS equipment . The difference active tDCS configure reach constant 2mA stimulation 20 minute , sham tDCS brief 2mA stimulation 30 second . During sham tDCS subject believe he/she stimulate normally , real effect . This procedure repeat five day , twice day . At end day 5 patient complete Positive Negative Syndrome Scale AHRS evaluate change AH . Patients ask complete scale 3 , 6 , 9 month tDCS intervention examine long-term effect .</detailed_description>
