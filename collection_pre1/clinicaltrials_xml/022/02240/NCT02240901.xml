	<brief_title>An Multi-center Randomized Clinical Trial About Using LMA ETI Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction 1.1 Background It essential peri-operative patient ensure airway patency effective ventilation , respiratory important task anesthesiologist 's daily work . Endotracheal intubation ( ETI ) gold standard maintenance patient ' ventilation general anesthesia . It effectively send narcotic gas trachea allow oxygen ventilation well control . However , ETI-related complication dental oral soft tissue injury , intubation extubation relate cardiovascular reaction , hind application special population elderly patient . Clinical application laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) bring new option new idea anesthesia management . LMA advantage light damage , small trauma , simple operation minor cardiovascular response , especially suitable airway control patient short minimally invasive operation . In recent year , application LMA great proportion compare ETI area . But LMA application increase , problem report . LMA great risk gastrointestinal reflux aspiration , inadequate airway tightness . For reason , LMA intolerance high airway pressure , may lead hypoventilation elderly patient lung compliance increase airway resistance . At time LMA ca n't completely prevent incidence postoperative sore throat hoarseness . Therefore , necessary carry multi-center clinical trial clarify peri-operative advantage disadvantage LMA elderly patient , preliminary explore LMA complication occur elderly patient use predictive model , clarify safety LMA airway support elderly patient . 1.2 Research Aims The aim present research study effect LMA compare conventional ETI elderly patient consider postoperative pulmonary complication , anesthesia recovery quality , oxygenation airway support related complication . 1.3 Primary endpoint event The morbidity mortality pulmonary complication associate intra-operative post-operative airway control . 1.4 Secondary endpoint event pre-specified outcome 1.4.1 Dosage anesthetic drug use surgery 1.4.2 Recovery time 1.4.3 PACU residence time 1.4.4 ICU admission stay time ( patient meet ICU inclusion criterion admit ICU , admit ICU bed conversion exclude , ICU also exclude ) 1.4.5 Time hospitalization 1.4.6 Hospitalization cost</detailed_description>
