	<brief_summary>Increased intracranial pressure cause disease progression patient brain disease , common cause poor prognosis . Intracranial pressure monitor observation disease , treatment , evaluation important way improve prognosis . Non-invasive intracranial pressure monitoring use stroke , intracranial hemorrhage , brain trauma , encephalitis patient . Ophthalmic artery originate internal carotid artery , optic canal orbit , entire process divide intracranial optic tube segment orbital segment . investigator ' preliminary experiment show intracranial pressure , intracranial ophthalmic artery segment velocity increase increase velocity difference orbital segment . Accordingly , investigator speculate , may judge level intracranial pressure intracranial orbital velocity difference ophthalmic artery segment , accordingly calculate specific value intracranial pressure . The investigator collect brain trauma surgery , perform invasive intracranial pressure monitoring case , use transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocity different segment ophthalmic artery pulsatility index , invasive intracranial pressure compare measure value calculate critical value ophthalmic artery segment intraorbital intracranial velocity difference intracranial pressure , thus fit Based projection mathematical formula intracranial pressure . This study provide non-invasive intracranial pressure monitor new approach .</brief_summary>
