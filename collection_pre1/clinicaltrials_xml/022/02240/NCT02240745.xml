	<brief_summary>The investigator go recruit patient schedule elective coronary angiography go dobutamin stress echography ( DSE ) coronary examination . Next regular 2D-DSE , investigator perform 3-dimensional DSE , incl ventriculography . In interventional part ( coronary angiography ) , measure stenosis fractional flow-reserve ( FFR ) herewith graduate stenosis severity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Three-dimensional Methods Analysis Detection Coronary Artery Disease Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Coronary heart disease lead cause death worldwide . Non-invasive , radiation-free diagnostic need improvement . In study , investigator test hypothesis method , measure myocardial deformation use 3D echocardiography superior previous ultrasound technology regard diagnosis stable coronary artery disease . The aim establish improve , non-invasive method diagnose stable coronary artery disease . Objective The investigator want investigate 3D-speckle-tracking superior accurate predict hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis predict 2D echocardiography ? The reference variable hemodynamic significance coronary artery stenosis invasively measure coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) consideration collateral flow ( CFI ) . Methods This prospective observational study . The investigator include 100 person schedule elective coronary angiography . A regular 2D-stress echocardiography accord international guideline perform ( incl . PLAX , SAX , 2CV , 4CV ) . The classification regional wall motion abnormality carry accord internationally recognize standard 16 myocardial segment LV , grade wall thickening ( 0 = dyskinetic , akinetic = 1 , 2 = hypokinetic , 3 = normal ) . In addition , 3D speckle track perform data transfer . To determine functional relevance stenosis ( reference method ) flow reserve maximum two coronary artery perform . Test accuracy 2D stress echocardiography new 3D method detect significant stenosis ( CFI &lt; 2 ) compare .</detailed_description>
