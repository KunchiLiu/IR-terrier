	<brief_summary>Heart Failure ( HF ) complex syndrome include physiological , neural hormonal metabolic complication know `` Cardiac Cachexia '' ( CC ) . In development CC release catabolic cytokine ( Tumor Necrosis Factor-α , interleukins 1 6 ) cause decrease fat free mass fat mass . These change body composition might reverse therapeutic combination resistance exercise branch chain amino acid supplementation ( BCAA ) . Thus purpose study evaluate change body composition resistance exercise program BCAA supplementation patient HF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) complex syndrome result structural and/or functional alteration limit ability respond physiological demand ( 1,2 ) .These abnormality involve metabolic neuro-hormonal factor tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , one important catabolic cytokine relate change body composition , interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , interferon Y , transmission growth factor β ( 3-9 ) , produce catabolic anabolic imbalance promote loss fat free mass ( FFM ) without loss fat mass ( FM ) patient HF . This syndrome call `` Cardiac Cachexia '' ( CC ) ( 10 ) . Signs symptom fatigue , anorexia decrease muscle strength reflect alter body composition ( 9 , 10 ) . There two possible way counteract catabolic factor restore body compartment . In one , protein supplementation promotes protein synthesis inhibits proteolysis ( 3,11,12 ) ; resistance exercise ( RE ) increase muscle mass muscle strength , maintain heart rate ( 13,14 ) . Previous study report association protein supplementation ( 15-17 ) exercise ( 18-23 ) change muscle strength case exercise capacity HF patient . However , therapy combine , study provide enough information change body composition . Based report , hypothesis combination RE protein supplementation form branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) might anabolic effect patient HF since supplementation BCAA could helpful `` fuel '' exercise maintain muscle mass metabolism ( 24 ) .</detailed_description>
