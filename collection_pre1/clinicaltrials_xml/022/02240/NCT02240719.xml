	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together bendamustine hydrochloride treat patient cancer blood ( hematologic cancer ) return period improvement ( relapse ) get good particular treatment ( refractory ) . Everolimus may prevent cancer cell grow block protein need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving everolimus together bendamustine hydrochloride may better treatment hematologic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Bendamustine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) everolimus administer combination bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) define hematologic malignancy . II . To determine safety tolerability administer everolimus combination bendamustine chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy everolimus administer combination bendamustine adult patient relapsed/refractory hematological malignancy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 2 everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
