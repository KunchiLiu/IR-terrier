	<detailed_description>The current study Phase I , open-label , multi-center , dose escalation study design evaluate safety , immunogencity , potential anti-tumor activity BB-MPI-03 three peptide plus adjuvant dose level . Subjects acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , smolder multiple myeloma ( sMM ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) treatment stable disease well eligible refuse allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) enrol . The study conduct 2 4 study center United States ( US ) . The study employ sequential group , open-label , 3+3 dose- escalation design determine safety MTD BB- MPI-03 .</detailed_description>
