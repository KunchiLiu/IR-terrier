	<brief_title>Assessment Dystussia Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recovery people mild , moderate , severe swallowing , speech , hearing , cognitive-communication impairment best facilitate team multidisciplinary specialist . Symptoms associate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) include disorder swallowing ( dysphagia ) , ataxia , frequently , inevitably , dysarthria disorder speech . Airway compromise also exist form impaired cough , dystussia . In view frequency oral intake problem individual TBI presence weaken cough , absence cough , along added challenge cognitive-communicative problem , study need increase understand degree disorder airway protection . From work appropriate intervention strategy design along understanding compensation may use assist improve swallow airway safety , oral intake management . Informed Consent Process : Investigators work subject TBI , also aware study , ability provide potential participant business card contain name study coordinator ( Dr. Erin Silverman ) well email telephone number . The individual participant responsible contact Dr. Silverman wish participate . Additional participant recruit via face face method previously IRB-approved study flyer local brain injury support group Shands Rehabilitation Hospital.The staff member consenting ( Dr. Silverman ) complete University Florida training HIPAA privacy issue . Subjects give immediate response enrolling may freely discuss study people choice make decision . Capacity consent decide consenting staff member ( Dr. Silverman ) . The study explain subject , question answer , write sign consent complete along HIPAA authorization . Written consent obtain prior collection health history study data . Once write informed consent obtain , Dr. Silverman conduct extensive interview order insure subject meet require inclusionary/exclusionary criterion . Neuropsychological Testing : The MOCA ( Montreal Cognitive Assessment ) administer Dr. Silverman , participant , upon entry study . Measures TBI severity : Multiple study correlate severity TBI upon initial admission relate TBI swallow function . The Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) Rancho Los Amigos Scale ( RLAS ) commonly administer upon admission TBI patient . When available ( availability may vary depend hospital initial admission ) record GCS and/or RLAS score admission . As well , investigator administer RLAS upon enrollment study . These measure incorporate statistical model well understand heterogeneity cognitive impairment swallow cough function . Cough respiratory measure : Pulmonary status screen measure : The forced expired volume first second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) exhalation measure use screen pulmonary function ( American Thoracic Society ) . Spirometry use derive FVC , FEV1 ratio FEV1/FVC measure ( Spirovision 3+m , Futuremed ) . Alternatively , subject unable perform cognitive voluntary spirometric task , upper airway respiratory resistance measure impulse oscillometry ( lOS , Jaeger Instruments ) . Maximum Respiratory Pressures : Maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure indirect measure inspiratory expiratory muscle strength , respectively . The ability generate high expiratory airflow essential produce high expiratory airflow , subsequently cough production measure initial assessment study . Cough : The participant instrument measurement respiratory airflow pattern spontaneous breathing , voluntary cough reflex capsaicin induce cough . A facemask pneumotachograph use record airflow change associate spontaneous breathing cough . The mouth airflow signal digitize record desktop computer ( Chart , ADinstruments , Inc ) . Inspiratory expiratory muscle EMG record provide neuromuscular motor assessment cough strength . The computer signal analyze determine inspiratory breath phase , expiratory breath phase , inspiratory cough phase , cough compression phase , expiratory cough phase . Because report brain injury differentially affect neuromuscular motor pattern voluntary reflex elicit cough , essential elicit cough peripheral afferent stimulation ( capsaicin ; reflexive cough ) voluntary induce cough TBI participant . Capsaicin administration : After participant instrument facemask , he/she seat comfortably chair front airflow fume hood . The airflow fume hood prevents exposure participant experimenter nebulized solution except participant inhales capsaicin challenge . Participants inspire deeply nebulizer ( contain capsaicin vehicle solution ) couple facemask pneumotachograph . The outflow nebulizer gas pass isopropyl alcohol solution remove capsaicin air vent fume hood . Cough threshold sensitivity determine use establish randomized block presentation method grade capsaicin concentration ( 0-2001-JM ) . The investigator FDA IND # 76866 use capsaicin study cough motor pattern . This take 10-15 minute complete . Design Procedures : This project address Specific Aim 1-year time period . Our Specific Aim focus characterize mechanical feature swallow cough motor function subject TBI swallow cough reconfiguration respiratory pattern . Our Specific Aim allow u determine relationship TBI swallow cough dysfunction . Study Protocol : Subjects medical history TBI recruit community TBI support group face face recruitment procedure . Once informed consent obtain , relevant medical history review , participant complete screen procedure determine inclusionary/exclusionary criterion . If inclusionary exclusionary criterion meet , participant complete follow test : - MIP MEP measurement - Reflex voluntary cough assessment Timeframe : This one-time visit study . Therefore , participant follow day present study procedure . There follow beyond day .</detailed_description>
