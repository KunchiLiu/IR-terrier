	<brief_title>Hemo Filtration Reinfusion ( HFR ) Clearance Efficiency Towards P-bound Toxins Effects Inflammatory Endothelial Damage Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protein-bound uremic toxin poorly remove current dialysis technique size , large pore size dialysis membrane available market . These protein-bound uremic toxin emerge important risk factor progression CKD , well cardiovascular disease . Several study demonstrate protein-bound uremic toxin induce vascular inflammation , endothelial dysfunction vascular calcification . In dialysis patient , serum concentration p-cresyl sulphate indoxyl sulphate approximately 17 54 time higher , respectively , healthy subject . Because toxin bound protein , 30 % less remove efficiently hemodialysis . Traditional renal replacement therapy depend upon diffusion convection solute clearance use adsorbent combination dialysis membrane may new therapeutic option increase removal rate uremic protein-bound toxin . HFR technique use dual dialyzer resin chamber . The first chamber high-flux membrane convective process take place . The ultrafiltrate obtain first chamber pass cartridge reinfused second chamber , low-flux membrane , diffusive process perform . In HFR , adsorption haemodiafiltration attach , use ultrafiltrate replacement fluid capable theoretically remove medium high molecular weight uremic toxin . A potential benefit regard toxicity , biocompatibility , tolerance , preservation essential element albumin , vitamin , amino acid growth factor . An improvement oxidative stress also describe HFR .</detailed_description>
