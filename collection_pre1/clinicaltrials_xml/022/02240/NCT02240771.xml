	<brief_summary>In India , majority patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) presentation hence unsuitable available curative treatment option . In patient treatment option mainly palliative . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , transarterial chemotherapy ( TAC ) various form oral chemotherapy available option currently . Many patient advanced disease involvement branch portal vein . This limit therapeutic option . According Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) staging , involvement portal vein preclude standard form therapy . TAC oral chemotherapy try group patient researcher . Which treatment ( TAC oral chemotherapy ) would well suitable advanced stage ( BCLC C ) need explored . However , randomize control trial ( RCT 's ) available . TAC procedure treat patient HCC portal vein invasion chemotherapeutic drug inject feeding vessel tumor subsequent embolization feeding vessel . In order select modality would produce good outcome advance HCC patient ( BCLC C ) , study plan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemotherapy Compared With Oral Chemotherapy Treatment Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Aim study : To see efficacy transarterial chemotherapy prolong survival patient unresectable HCC compare oral chemotherapy 2 . Diagnostic criterion Cirrhosis liver- Diagnosis found basis clinical , biochemical , image endoscopy finding . Hepatocellular carcinoma- one follow present 1 . Two image modality ( dual phase CT ( DPCT ) / contrast enhanced MRI ) show arterialization hepatic mass 2 . Alpha feto protein ( AFP ) 400ng/ml along arterialization one imaging modality ( DPCT/ contrast enhance MRI ) 3 . Fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) 3 . Definitions 3.1 . Unresectable HCC- • Liver mass large 5cm diameter ( single/ multiple ) , involve main portal vein underlie cirrhotic liver 3.2 . Tumor response This base Dual phase CT finding - Complete response ( CR ) - Tumor fully cover lipiodol show viable tissue - Partial response ( PR ) - Tumor partially cover ( &gt; 75 % ) lipiodol - Mild response ( MR ) - About 50 75 % coverage tumor lipiodol - No response ( NR ) - About 25 50 % coverage tumor lipiodol - Fresh lesion ( FL ) - Appearance new mass lesion liver without recurrence site previous mass 3.3 Patient tolerance Grade 1 : side effect Grade 2 : moderate side effect Grade 3 : severe side effect Grade 4 : life threaten side effect 3.4 Performance status ( PST score ) PST score 0-5 would assess follow basis 0- No cancer relate symptom . Normal life style 1 . Minor symptom related cancer . Capable non-strenuous activity . Fully ambulatory 2 . Ambulatory capable self-care unable carry work activity . Confined bed less 50 % waking hour 3 . Capable limited self-care . Confined bed 50 % waking hour . 4 . Completely disabled . Can carry self-care . Totally confined bed . 5 . Death 4 . Sample Size Systematic review RCT 's TAC show 2-year survival 40 % . Expecting oral chemotherapy 2-year survival 40 % 5 % non-inferiority margin 80 % power 5 % error , sample size 124 patient arm would require . ( Total 248 patient ) 5 . Randomization • Patients randomized confirmation diagnosis obtain write consent - Sequences generate Statistician - Stratified randomization do . Two strata child 's A B make - Randomization do draw consecutively number opaque seal envelope Randomization A ( TAC ) B ( oral chemotherapy ) do 6 . Follow post TAC 6.1 Clinical follow - All patient would follow Liver clinic monthly unless clinical condition warrant earlier follow - Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also do visit AFP ( elevate earlier ) every six month - Patient tolerance , child 's status would estimate . 6.2 Imaging follow - At one month , dual phase CT would do ascertain response therapy need repeat procedure . Subsequently , DPCT would do 3 6 monthly interval . 7 . Repeat TAC follow This would do follow noted - DPCT show viable tumor - Fresh lesion appear - Elevated serum AFP occur without appearance viable mass DPCT</detailed_description>
