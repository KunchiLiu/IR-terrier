	<brief_summary>Since introduction sentinel node biopsy breast cancer , become clear use reliable reproducible . Today , clinical routine remove lymph node axilla ( arm pit ) case sentinel node ( first lymph node/s reach lymphatic flow breast ) free tumor deposit . It also routine leave remain lymph node behind case sentinel node contain minimal cluster tumor cell , call isolated tumor cell ( formerly submicrometastasis ) . Even slightly large tumor deposit , call micrometastasis ( 2 mm size ) , show completion axillary clearance ( removal lymph node arm pit ) contribute well survival . Data randomize study indicate seem safe omit axillary clearance even sentinel node biopsy show 2 node tumor deposit 2 mm size ( macrometastasis ) . These study change clinical practice many country , however , still debate whether safe omit axillary clearance case sentinel node macrometastasis due under-recruitment aforementioned study . The rationale omit extensive axillary surgery avoidance postoperative morbidity arm lymphedema , loss sensation , pain swelling . The hypothesis refrain axillary clearance breast cancer patient 1-2 sentinel node macrometastasis worsen breast cancer-specific survival maximum 2.5 % 5 year . This study prospective multicenter randomize trial include majority center Sweden treat breast cancer . Planned accrual 3700 patient . Breast cancer patient without sign axillary nodal involvement eligible sentinel node biopsy . Those find two sentinel node contain macrometastasis inform trial Those wish participate randomize either undergo axillary surgery ( clearance ) . Outcome measure breast cancer-specific survival , disease-free survival , axillary recurrence rate overall survival .</brief_summary>
