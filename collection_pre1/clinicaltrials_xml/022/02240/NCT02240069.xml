	<brief_title>Wood Smoke Interventions Native American Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rural Native American ( NA ) communities experience disproportionate disease burden compare US population , poor indoor air quality result in-home biomass smoke exposure ( residential wood stove ) likely contributor health burden discrepancy . Epidemiological study support etiological association indoor biomass smoke exposure several domain global disease burden , particularly respect pediatric respiratory tract infection adult chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic bronchitis . Elderly population particularly susceptible chronic respiratory condition , decline pulmonary function associate increased morbidity mortality . Randomized trial develop country demonstrate impact improve cookstove technology reduce biomass smoke exposures child 's risk acute respiratory infection . However limited knowledge available regard potential improvement NA elderly population follow wood stove intervention . Today , critical need exist efficient community-based intervention aim promote healthy indoor environment at-risk community . Financial logistical barrier currently exist rural economically disadvantage NA community prohibit implementation sustainability many environmental health intervention . Regarding wood stove , qualitative input expert Native community underscore need innovative low-cost , sustainable intervention target reduction in-home biomass smoke exposure . In proposal , investigator test community-level education-based household-level strategy aim promote implement best-burn practice improve air quality respiratory health at-risk elderly population . This proposal represent multidisciplinary collaboration university tribal stakeholder two Native American Reservations develop , adapt , implement , evaluate two-level intervention reduce exposure indoor biomass smoke improve respiratory health among elderly tribal member . Community-based participatory research technique use adapt intervention approach meet cultural context participate community . At community level , investigator facilitate local development tribal agency-led wood yard distribution program ensure elderly and/or person need access dry wood heating . With community advisory guidance , investigator use three arm randomize placebo-controlled intervention trial implement assess education best burn practice ( Tx1 ) household level . This educational intervention evaluate indoor air filtration unit arm ( Tx2 ) , well placebo arm ( Tx3 , sham air filter ) . Tx3 use comparison two treatment arm evaluate penetration efficacy community-level fuel program . Outcomes evaluated respect change marker respiratory health among elder change indoor air quality ( PM2.5 ) . The investigator hypothesize locally-designed education-based intervention , context community-based strategy focus wood fuel , result efficacious sustainable strategy reduce personal exposure indoor biomass smoke PM2.5 lead respiratory health improvement elderly NA population . Specific Aims follow : Aim 1 . Facilitate tribally-centered development , adaption , implementation , evaluation community-level wood yard distribution program participate tribal household . Aim 2 . Facilitate development , adaptation , implementation , evaluation household-level education strategy target best-burn practice ( Tx1 ) participate tribal community . Aim 3 . Compare effectiveness , within community , household-level intervention among elderly adult participate three-arm randomized placebo-controlled trial . Aim 3a . Compare group change pulmonary function respiratory symptoms infection . Aim 3b . Compare group change indoor personal PM2.5 exposure . Aim 4 . Evaluate penetration , acceptance , sustainability community- household-level strategy use qualitative quantitative data generate collaboration tribal community advisory board research participant . Impact . The long-term goal project reduce mortality morbidity NA community exposures related residential home heating . This study advance knowledge effective intervention within two unique NA Reservations describe improvement sub-clinical indicator pulmonary health susceptible elderly population . Reducing in-home wood smoke exposures community level facilitation access proper fuel introduction sustainable , culturally appropriate best-burn practice inform strategy translation NA community similar rural underserved population .</detailed_description>
