	<brief_summary>The objective trial ass healthy adult safety reactogenicity new candidate vaccine , cAd3-EBOZ , make chimpanzee Adenovirus vector encode glycoprotein Zaire Ebola virus . The secondary objective assess immunogenicity candidate vaccine find suitable dose deployment epidemic area Africa . The 120 plan study subject compose possibly expose volunteer own organisation `` Médecins sans frontières '' susceptible deploy outbreak zone ( name `` possibly exposed volunteer '' ) . The volunteer adult plan travel epidemic zone ( name `` exposed volunteer '' ) . The first group randomly allocate two different group ( low dose = single injection 2.5x10e10 viral particle ( vp ) , high dose = single injection 5x10e10 vp ) . The second group randomly allocate three different group ( low dose = single injection 2.5x10e10 viral particle ( vp ) , high dose = single injection 5x10e10 vp placebo = single injection vaccine diluent ) . The design double-blind . Follow-up visit take place Day 1 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 90 180 .</brief_summary>
