	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Apremilast Treat Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , study evaluate efficacy safety 2 dos apremilast subject active UC ( define total Mayo score [ TMS ] ≥ 6 ≤ 11 , endoscopic subscore ≥ 2 ) . Treatment assignment stratify base concomitant use oral corticosteroid previous exposure immunosuppressant ( eg , 6-mercaptopurine [ 6-MP ] , azathioprine [ AZA ] , methotrexate [ MTX ] ) .The number subject previous exposure immunosuppressant target comprise 50 % subject enrol , less 30 % . Approximately 165 subject ( 55 subject per arm ) randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive oral apremilast ( 30 mg BID 40 mg BID ) , identically appear placebo BID 12 week ( Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase ) , follow 40 week blind active treatment apremilast , either 30 mg BID 40 mg BID ( Blinded Active-treatment Phase ) . At end 52 week study , subject Mayo endoscopy score ≤ 1 opportunity participate Extension Phase continue receive blind , active treatment apremilast additional 52 week . All subject prematurely discontinue study reason spend 4 week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase , 4-week period follow last dose investigational product ( study treatment ) .</detailed_description>
