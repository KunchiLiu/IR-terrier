	<brief_title>Orally Administrated JBM-TC4 Prevents Acute Radiodermatitis Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct 2 site Taiwan . Upon confirmation meeting eligibility criterion , randomize 1:1:1 ratio 2000 mg 3000 mg JBM-TC4 oral treatment group placebo control group . The treatment start one week prior radiotherapy continue radiotherapy period additional 11 week JBM-TC4 . The patient take 3 treatment capsule twice day , breakfast dinner . Screening visit occur 14 day prior randomization ( Day 0 ) , informed consent form sign patient eligibility criterion verified.Medical history information , chemistry/hematology evaluation , serum pregnancy conduct document . On Day 0 , baseline assessment do study drug dispense . The patient instructed start study medication breakfast Day 1 record administration time study diary . Post-operative radiotherapy begin patient take treatment 7 day . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 92 , data include radiation dermatitis severity , redness pain scale collect patient return clinic evaluation . On Days 29 , 57 , 85 92 , quality life questionnaire complete patient blood drawn chemistry/hematology evaluation . The final study visit occur one week last dose study medication , around Day 92 . ECG evaluate Day 8 92 . A total 120 woman breast cancer recruit study . Safety assess record adverse event , assessment vital sign , chemistry/hematology laboratory test . During clinic visit , investigator take vital sign patient ask patient experienced adverse event . All information record case report form . The primary efficacy endpoint study assess effectiveness JBM-TC4 prevention treatment acute radiation-induced dermatitis . The effectiveness determine record radiation dermatitis severity scale patient weekly study visit . Secondary efficacy endpoint include 1 ) Presence moist desquamation 2 ) redness radiation treat site visit . 3 ) The bad pain related dermatitis baseline follow-up visit radiotherapy site . 4 ) Quality life 5 ) safety evaluation assessment . At final visit , investigator ask rate patient ' response treatment .</detailed_description>
