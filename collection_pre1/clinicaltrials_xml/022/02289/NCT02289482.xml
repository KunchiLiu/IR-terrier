	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety , tolerability PKs GSK2838232 without Ritonavir , evaluate different formulation GSK2838232 healthy subject . This study evaluate high single RTV boost dos support continue clinical development GSK2838232 clinically relevant dos , subsequently infect HIV dose range phase 2 study . The study conduct 2 part : Part A Part B , study Part A Part B may conduct parallel . Approximately 20 healthy subject enrol study , 8 Part A 12 Part B . Part A double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , 4-period , single dose escalation design . Subjects randomized 3:1 receive GSK2838232 placebo . Subjects randomize placebo receive placebo four period . Following completion Period 2 PK assessment 96hr post-dose , subject begin daily dose RTV 100mg total 26 day . Part B randomize , open-label , unbalanced , 3-period , cross-over design ; subject randomize 1:1 sequence . The relative bioavailability single 100mg dos powder bottle ( PIB ) active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) GSK2838232 versus PIB spray-dried dispersion ( SDD ) assess . A single dose GSK2838232 co-administered 10th day RTV dosing ; RTV dose continue additional 4 day ( total 14 day ) . Subjects screen visit within 30 day prior first dose follow-up visit 7-14 day last dose .</brief_summary>
