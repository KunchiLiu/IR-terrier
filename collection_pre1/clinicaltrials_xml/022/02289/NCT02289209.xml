	<brief_title>Reirradiation With MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) Locoregional Inoperable Recurrence Second Primary Squamous Cell CA Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each participant undergo screen treat reirradiation 1.2 Gy BID , 5 day week ( week 1-5 ) . MK-3475 ( generic name : pembrolizumab , trade name Keytruda® ) give 200mg intravenous every 3 week start day one reirradiation continue participant 3 month post completion reirradiation , time PET/CT do evaluate response . Participants progressive disease ( PD ) take MK-3475 follow survival . Participants complete response ( CR ) follow clinically radiographically , disease recurs may eligible retreat MK-3475 one year . Participants partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) continue treatment MK-3475 two year unless one follow occurs : - document disease progression - unacceptable adverse event ( ) - intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment - investigator decision withdraw subject - withdrawal consent - pregnancy - noncompliance - administrative reason ( i.e . trial close prematurely ) . Participants progress completion 24 month therapy observe , may eligible 1 year retreatment MK-3475 develop recurrence/progression qualify retreatment detail protocol , trial still ongoing .</detailed_description>
