	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) complicate 50 % cardiac surgical procedure child increase morbidity use healthcare resource . The pathogenesis AKI poorly understood , current diagnostic test lack specificity sensitivity , effective treatment . Improving outcomes patient risk AKI recently define National Health Service priority . The investigator currently undertake program work evaluate role plasma-derived microvesicles ( MV ) MV associate microRNAs ( miRNA ) diagnostic biomarkers therapeutic target cardiac surgery patient risk develop AKI . Preliminary result indicate biomarkers may clinical utility adult . An important consideration whether biomarkers also utility child undergo cardiac surgery . Measurement MV serial time point child present ethical challenge relate conduct clinical research critically ill subject . It also present technical challenge relate small volume blood may sample safely baby infant undergo surgery . The aim study provide estimate perioperative variance MV concentration 24 child undergoing cardiac surgery , well frequency AKI adverse event , protocol adherence recruitment rate . This assist design subsequent prospective observational study consider role MV/miRNA child undergo cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-centre observational feasibility study measure change MV signal relationship inflammatory response cardiac surgery child . The investigator primary hypothesis inflammatory renal injury follow paediatric cardiac surgery regulate circulate MV specifically MV associate miRNA . The investigator secondary hypothesis : 1 . MV derive signal differ cyanotic patient , patient group significantly increase risk AKI . 2 . MV subsets and/or MV derive miRNA may act novel diagnostic biomarkers AKI . To assist design prospective observational study test hypotheses investigator propose undertake feasibility study 24 child . The objective feasibility study : A.To establish number patient eligible enrolment study , number recruit study , clinical demographic characteristic . B.To determine proportion consent patient develop AKI follow cardiac surgery . C.To measure perioperative change MV subgroup MV associate miRNA , well platelet monocyte activation , variance measure . D.To establish protocol adherence , respect adequacy time blood sample take calculation creatinine clearance perioperatively .</detailed_description>
