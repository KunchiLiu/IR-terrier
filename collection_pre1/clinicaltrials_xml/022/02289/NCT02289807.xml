	<brief_summary>Currently , concurrent chemoradiotherapy with/without sequential chemotherapy standard treatment modality intermediate risk NPC ( stage II T3N0M0 ) accord National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline . However recommendation base evidence two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy ( 2DCRT ) era . The introduction intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) NPC treatment bring substantial well treatment outcomes 2DCRT . It question whether additional concurrent chemotherapy still necessary intermediate risk NPC within excellent framework IMRT . hus , jointly conduct first non-inferior randomize trial determine value concurrent chemotherapy cisplatin intermediate risk NPC patient treat IMRT . Given result clinical study mention , decide adopt concurrent regimen cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 , 22 , 43</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemotherapy Intermediate Risk Patients Treated With Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Patients non-keratinizing NPC T1-2N1M0/T2-3N0M0 ( UICC/AJCC 7th edition ) randomly assign receive CCRT RT alone . Patients CCRT group receive cisplatin 100 mg/m² every 3 week 3 cycle , concurrently intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . IMRT give 2.0-2.30 Gy per fraction five daily fraction per week 6-7 week total dose 66 Gy great primary tumor . Our primary endpoint failure-free survival ( FFS ) . Secondary end point include overall survival ( OS ) , locoregional failure-free survival ( LR-FFS ) , distant failure-free survival ( D-FFS ) rate toxic effect . All efficacy analysis conduct intention-to-treat population , safety population include patient receive randomly assign treatment .</detailed_description>
