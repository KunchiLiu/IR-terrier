	<brief_summary>The propose study , 200207 double blind , placebo control , single repeat dose escalation study investigate safety , tolerability PK GSK2838232 alone co-administered RTV 100 milligram ( mg ) Once daily ( QD ) . This study enable future clinical development GSK2838232 healthy subject Phase IIa proof concept study Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infect patient . This study single repeat dose escalation study conduct two Parts . Part A evaluate GSK2838232 20 mg 50 mg administer QD 8 day Part B evaluate GSK2838232 10 mg , 20 mg , 50 mg , co-administered RTV 100 mg , QD 11 day . The extended period dose account longer terminal phase half-life GSK2838232 give RTV . Dose cohort enrol sequentially ; enrollment cohort commence follow review interim PK safety data least 4 subject precede cohort . Subjects part screen visit within 30 day prior first dose follow-up visit 7-14 day last dose . Maximum duration study participation approximately 7 week . Approximately 40 healthy subject enrol , 8 subjects/cohort . Subjects randomize 3:1 receive GSK2838232 placebo .</brief_summary>
