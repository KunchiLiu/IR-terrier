	<detailed_description>Effect stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex language production healthy bilingual Background : Language relies two main neurocognitive component ; dedicate language network depend perisylvian structure , domain-general control-executive work memory system rely prefrontal , particularly leave cingulum dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) network . The executive system know participate language control bilingual , also play role many intra-languages processing , mother language ( L1 ) even second language production ( L2 ) . Anodal-tDCS appear improve cognitive function ( e.g . work memory , complex verbal problem-solving , inhibition ) adult . Despite fact contribution executive function language process monolingual multilingual speaker crucial , receive considerable attention . Aim : This study aim demonstrate impact modulation executive function , particularly subserve DLPFC , language production healthy bilingual . The investigator propose impact particularly present L2 . The experimental task test impact prefrontal stimulation tDCS ( Anodal compare Sham ) leave DLPFC healthy adult bilingual subject two task rely lexical strategy : picture name task L1 L2 word translation task . The EEG correlate task perform follow tDCS analyse , allow u investigate precisely spatiotemporal brain dynamic underlying behavioural modification induce modulation leave frontal area . The hypothesis : 1 . A-tDCS-induced leave DLPFC activation increase performance particularly L2 name translation task versus baseline performance ( sham tDCS ) . 2 . A-tDCS expect modify cortical activity relate language task . During name , EEG analyse show main effect stimulation interaction factor Language ( L1 L2 ) Stimulation ( sham , anodal ) topographic level , show effect prefrontal area large L2 L1 . The latency ERP modulation tDCS L2 allow u target dynamic language planning process underlie improve naming performance . Methods : The experimental task include healthy L1-L2 unbalanced subject . The investigator analyse influence DLPFC stimulation name translation ability use tDCS well EEG correlate L1 L2 . The prediction leave prefrontal Anodal-stimulation increase language performances particularly L2 . EEG analyse unravel spatio-temporal dynamic executive process involve two task . EEG EEG direct non-invasive technique record electrical activity produce neuron scalp high temporal resolution . EEG record obtain place electrode scalp . The event-related potential processed/analysed offline . tDCS TDCS affordable safe method brain stimulation broadly use general population . In tDCS , cerebral cortex stimulate weak constant electric current ( 1-2 mA ) two electrode ( 35 cm2 70cm2 , `` active '' electrode target special region brain `` return '' electrode ) . This weak current induce focal change cortical excitability last beyond period stimulation . In general , Anodal stimulation ( A-tDCS ) suppose depolarize neuron lead increase excitability , whereas Cathodal stimulation ( C-tDCS ) opposite effect compare sham . Sham tDCS ( S-tDCS ) refers control condition subject receive brief current stimulator remain rest stimulation time . In way , individual receive S-tDCS aware receive prolong stimulation.The mechanism tDCS effect classify synaptic ( change alter strength synaptic transmission ) non-synaptic ( shifts rest membrane potential pre post-synaptic neuron ) . Language proficiency assessment To assess language immersion , participant ask age acquisition , long lived region French English language speak , language speak family , childhood , current daily life , language acquire school . In self-evaluation part , participant indicate analogue scale 1 100 % estimate reading , speaking , comprehension write skill . Moreover , sub-test computer-based DIALANG language diagnosis system use evaluate reading performance . Procedure This study consist two session , one week apart , counterbalance order : 1 . Anodal A-tDCS , 2 . Sham-tDCS . In session , evaluations/tasks use . - A-tDCS intervention : The active anodal electrode place DLPFC return electrode contralateral supraorbital area . A 1.5mA direct current flow electrode 20 minute . To decrease current-induced injury , begin stimulation , current reach 0 1.5mA 30 second ( fade-in ) , end decrease 1.5mA 0 15 second ( fade-out ) . - Sham-tDCS intervention : The parameter mimic A-tDCS ( i.e . electrode placement , fade-in current intensity ) , except duration stimulation : current reach 1.5mA 30 second ( fade-in ) last 30 second ( give initial sensation stimulation ) decrease 0 . The two language context present within two session counterbalance order across subject . At begin language context session , short text write corresponding language show subject order activate language interest . Participants seat electrically shield sound attenuate booth front LCD screen . Stimulus delivery response record control use E-Prime 2.0 . The stimulus present center screen . Stimuli task Verbal non-verbal fluency task , without EEG record At minute 15/20 tDCS , verbal fluency task L1 do ( subject ask name many word he/she start certain letter 1 minute ) . At 16/20 minute , non-verbal fluency task ( 5 point test , i.e . sheet paper 40 square fix symmetrically arrange point ( 5 point ) present participant . The participant ask produce many different figure possible connect dot least one line connect two dot 2 minute ) . And minute 18/20 , verbal fluency L2 do 1 minute ( accord Nitsche Paulus effect tDCS reach maximum 4/20 minute stimulation ) . Naming task L1 L2 EEG measure The naming task do base corpus 70 picture , correspond word match English French pertinent psycholinguistic factor . The stimuli consist black white line drawing ( 8.5 x 8.5cm ) represent manufacture object ( tool , furniture , clothes , kitchen object , electric apparatus , vehicle etc . ) living object , select Snodgrass Vanderwart image bank accord lexical pre-lexical norm database . The naming task consist 2 block , one L1 one L2 ( block 70 image ) 2-minute pause two block . The order block counterbalance . In trial , image present centrally ( 1000 m ) fixation cross 300 m . The subject maximum 2000 m name object . Translation task L1 L2 EEG measurement Then , perform offline task consist translate 8 minute 100 word ( 5 letter length ) L1 second language ( L2 ) vice versa . Both sens translation mix randomly increase work memory load . Translation corpus consist 50 word language , match across L1 L2 frequency , length syllable phoneme . Words present screen subject ask translate word language . The word present 1500 m screen fixation cross 300ms . The subject maximum 2500ms translation . Behavioural EEG analyse Behavioural analysis A first behavioural analysis compare name translation performance , well speech onset latency languages . Statistical analysis conduct accord 2X2 experimental design Language ( L1 ; L2 ) Stimulation ( Anodal , Sham ) within-subject factor . The investigator main interest interaction term Language Stimulation . The investigator expect interaction drive leave DLPFC stimulation A-tDCS improve performance L2 L1 . Event Related Potentials ( ERP ) analyse ERPs analyze use step-wise procedure permit time-wise , multifactorial statistical assessment ( 1 ) dynamic change scalp-recorded electric field configuration temporal segmentation quasi-stable functional micro-states index modulation configuration intracranial generator , ( 2 ) global electric field power index modulation response strength intracranial generator , ( 3 ) intracranial distribute linear electrical source estimation . These analysis conduct time frame whole ERP time-period ; however , specific time window plan sensitive investigator factor accord meta-analyses investigator previous result : lexical selection think occurs 170 270 ms picture presentation , first time window 200 m , second time window 200 300 m , late time window ( 300-450 m ) correspond lexical-phonological encode previous study . The main effect L1 L2 pattern term amplitude , duration sequence . Then , second main effect anodal tDCS / sham tDCS effect early time window vocalization start . The investigator expect interaction language stimulation , due fact leave DLPFC anodal-tDCS modulate L2</detailed_description>
