	<detailed_description>Individuals carry certain germline TP53 gene mutation highly susceptible cancer likely develop one , many , cancer type lifetimes . Prevention strategy early tumor detection strategy crucial individual . It show Villani et al . aggressive monitoring marker cancer lead much good outcome ( e.g. , early detection cancer ) standard monitoring protocol . However , choice marker use early detection indicate presence cancer surveillance monitoring strategy patient individual specific cancer predisposition , inherited cancer syndrome , complex . This choice often guide observed utility set marker among broad list potential marker large-scale population-level clinical study . However , utility early detection surveillance strategy base set marker population large necessarily translate utility marker particular individual . This phenomenon even problematic individual rare hereditary cancer syndrome condition , individual germline TP53 gene mutation , individual highly susceptible different type cancer lifetimes . Even among individual TP53 mutation variation age-of-onset cancer due factor , exposures carcinogenic substance presence susceptibility mutation ( Arrifin et al . 2015 ) . In addition , give individual inherit TP53 mutation indeed rare , large-scale study pursue identify set marker might useful monitoring TP53 mutation carrier go forward sign cancer disease generally . Specifically , individual inherit DNA sequence variant TP53 gene great 90 % chance develop cancer lifetimes often develop multiple sequential cancer life . Women carry TP53 mutation 82 % chance develop cancer age 45 ( Chompret A et al . 2000 ) , general , average age onset cancer individual carry TP53 mutation 28 year old , statistic take account factor , type mutation present genetic background setting carrier live . ( Ruijs et al . 2010 ; Sagne et al . 2014 ; Petitjean et al . 2007 ) Individuals ultimately develop cancer harbor inherit TP53 gene mutation describe medical literature 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome ' . Unfortunately , TP53 mutation-carrying relatives individual either frank Li-Fraumeni syndrome carry mutation TP53 gene ( yet develop cancer ) even elevate risk develop cancer . ( Hwang et al . 2003 ; Nichols et al . 2001 ) In addition , show 'anticipation ' occurs family Li-Fraumeni syndrome , age onset cancer formation earlier generation generation , put TP53 mutation carrier older relative develop early onset cancer even great risk develop cancer early life . ( Trkova et al . 2002 ; Arrifini et al . 2015 ) In light finding , individual carrier TP53 mutation sibling develop Li-Fraumeni syndrome , family individual older generation early onset cancer , much likely develop early onset cancer monitor closely sign cancer . In fact , document age-of-onset specific cancer describe literature . Table 1 show ranges average age-of-onset different cancer depend measure activation level mutant TP53 protein , base data describe study Petitjean et al . ( 2007 ) Note first TP53 mutation carrier develop multiple cancer lifetime , age-of-onsets cancer Table 1 may associate second third cancer develop carrier . Second , note category 'soft tissue sarcoma ' refer number type cancer single cancer . These fact suggest monitoring individual early sign cancer , even adulthood , benefit , especially soft tissue , brain , bone sarcoma . Importantly , show early detection cancer carrier TP53 mutation , frank Li-Fraumeni syndrome , dramatically enhance survival effectiveness therapeutic intervention , describe Villani et al . ( 2011 ) among others . However , sophisticated comprehensive patient monitoring scheme facilitate detection early sign cancer individual carry TP53 mutation lack , although marker use study Villani et al . ( 2011 ) show promise . In addition , currently accept insurance-reimbursable monitoring practice TP53 mutation carrier one whole body image per year , simply inadequate fact show inadequate clinical study Villani et al . ( 2011 ) As result fact , current project design develop prototype longitudinal 'biomarker ' ( e.g. , blood base protein ) 'biometric ' ( e.g. , image wearable wireless device ) monitoring strategy carrier TP53 mutation even pronounce predisposition cancer due familial aggregation cancer . This monitoring strategy could useful identify change biomarkers might either reflect cancer formation health-related phenomenon may exacerbate susceptibility cancer . The project leverage different marker , assay device , well development analysis prototype visualization method draw inference marker device data . Ultimately , protocol focus objective , statistical evidence-based assessment utility biomarker-based surveillance method individual subject carry TP53 mutation high-cancer susceptibility setting ( e.g. , sibling Li-Fraumeni syndrome familial cancer older generation ) . The protocol include vet marker describe Villani et al . ( 1 ) well comprehensive set marker , biometrics procedure order increase likelihood detect value change status marker likely biomedical importance . Since 50 % ( 4/7 ) cancer survivor successfully monitor Villani et al . ( 2011 ) study age 20 , fact age-of-onset cancer among TP53 mutation carrier lowest family history Li-Fraumeni early onset cancer , publish report state age-of-onset cancer among TP53 mutation carrier low ( e.g. , Table 1 ) , believe deploy protocol minor child justify . Since many biomarkers study likely genetic basis , make sense collect phenotype biosamples family member target patient value act control value target patient 's value . The marker frequency collect via protocol currently enrol patient include : - Whole body Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) analyse every 4-6 month - Focused bilateral breast MRI every 6 month - Abdominal ultrasound image every 6 month - Stool microbiome via shotgun sequence every two week - Extensive blood metabolite profile month - Circulating cell-free DNA month - DNA repair assay result blood cell month - Literature-backed early cancer detection blood-based marker every two month ( 17-OH-pregnenolone , testosterone , progesterone , 11 deoxycortisol , deoxycorticosterone ( DOC ) , beta-2-microglobulin , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , Cancer Antigen 125 ( CA-125 ) , β-human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-HCG ) , alpha-fetoprotein , 17-OH-progesterone , androstenedione , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , lactate dehydrogenase ) . - Complete blood count information every two month - Serum electrolyte liver function test every two month ( sodium , potassium , chloride , bicarbonate , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , glucose , calcium , albumin , total protein , bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase ) This propose , single-subject , ' N-of-1 ' study design involve longitudinal data collection ( i.e. , repeat sampling ) TP53 carrier detect likely health-informative change time . We emphasize many biomarkers biometrics study potential detect cancer , may also simply provide indication health status change generally envision propose study one focus prototyping implementation system monitor biomarkers may detect tumor formation indicate health status change could warrant scrutiny .
