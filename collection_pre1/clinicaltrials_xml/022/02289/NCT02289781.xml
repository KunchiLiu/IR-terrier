	<brief_summary>A randomize , control clinical trial design analyze wear enamel oppose polished monolithic zirconia crown polish veneer surface metal-ceramic crown . This single-blind pilot study involve total 30 teeth require full coverage crown oppose natural antagonist teeth . The objective research test follow hypothesis : ( 1 ) difference mean wear antagonist enamel polish monolithic zirconia crown polish veneer surface metal-ceramic crown statistically significant ; ( 2 ) difference mean wear antagonist enamel oppose polished monolithic zirconia crown enamel oppose enamel statistically significant ; ( 3 ) difference mean antagonist wear enamel oppose polish veneer surface metal-ceramic crown enamel oppose enamel statistically significant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To participate study crown need place one back teeth . This generally occur back tooth big filling risk fracture tooth root canal perform tooth . An initial x-ray tooth surround teeth do make sure enough bone support tooth crown . A receive local anesthesia use area crown make . The tooth area may need build-up fill material enough tooth structure remain . Once happen , high-speed drill use grind tooth material use make small size original tooth . A small thread use make space gum tooth accurate replica tooth make . A temporary crown make go prepared tooth cement final crown ready cement . The extra procedure do measure bite force see much force exert teeth . Other extra procedure include six month yearly impression well scan teeth aid measurement wear . Participants randomly assign ( much like flip coin ) receive either crown metal crown all-ceramic . Both material consider standard care dental practice .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must 21 year age good overall health . No contraindication dental treatment present Subjects must good overall good dental health low caries risk , active tooth decay ( caries ) , periodontal disease . Periodontal pocket depth remain teeth great 4 mm Subjects must exist temporomandibular disorder , ( e.g . clicking , popping , pain open ) parafunctional habit ( e.g . bruxism , clench ) Subjects must need crown either first second premolar first second molar arch . Abutment teeth must restorable crown : root ratio least 1:1 . Abutment teeth must full complement oppose nonrestored minimally restored natural teeth . Minimally restored mean teeth contain restoration great Class II amalgam restoration . The oppose arch must full coverage restoration partial denture . The contralateral tooth antagonist present Subjects must exhibit good oral hygiene compliance oral hygiene instruction determine amount plaque present tooth surface Subjects must exhibit normal flow saliva . Subjects medical pathology limit salivary flow volume require chronic intake medication minimize flow saliva exclude study Subjects must willing pay $ 500 clinic incidental must compliant yearly appointment anything meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
