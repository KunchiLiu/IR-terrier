	<brief_summary>The central goal study determine compare similarity differences regional brain uptake [ 18F ] T807 patient typical Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) , Posterior Cortical Atrophy ( PCA ) , Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia ( lvPPA ) . The investigator correlate pattern [ 18F ] T807 bind magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based regional volumetric cortical thickness measure . If cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) sample available , patient may ask get optional lumbar puncture ( LP ) additional comparison . The investigator recruit 20 participant , 45-70 year old , clinical evidence young onset focal dementia .</brief_summary>
