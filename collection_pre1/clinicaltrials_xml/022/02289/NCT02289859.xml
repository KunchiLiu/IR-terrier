	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether undermine cutaneous surgery improve scar cosmesis compare wound closure without undermine . Our aim compare outcome use split wound model , half wound undermine half . This measured via physician observer scar assessment scale , validated scar instrument via wound width . Our hypothesis wound undermine result cosmetically superior wound outcome .</detailed_description>
