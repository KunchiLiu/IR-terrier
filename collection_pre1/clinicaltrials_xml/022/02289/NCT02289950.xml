	<brief_title>A Study Assess Efficacy Safety Farletuzumab ( MORAb 003 ) Combination With Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Carboplatin Plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin ( PLD ) Subjects With Low CA125 Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrol targeted 1:1 stratification ratio 1 2 chemotherapy treatment arm investigator 's discretion : carboplatin plus paclitaxel carboplatin plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin ( PLD ) , randomize 2:1 ratio receive weekly farletuzumab 5 mg/kg placebo ( ie , Test Article ) . All subject receive load dose first 2 week 10 mg/kg Test Article ( farletuzumab placebo ) . Subjects stratified randomization individual chemotherapy treatment regimen ( target 1:1 ratio ) platinum-free interval follow first-line therapy ( 6 12 month vs great 12 36 month ) .</detailed_description>
