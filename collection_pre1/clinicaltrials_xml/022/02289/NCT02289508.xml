	<detailed_description>Acute heart failure syndrome ( aHFS ) cause almost 1 million hospitalization annually United States lead cause hospitalization person age 65 year . In 2003 , inpatient management aHFS cost estimate $ 12.7 billion United States . In 2003 , 12.5 % population Hong Kong age 65 , third high proportion elderly among country , postulated 2033 , proportion elderly population increase 25 % . With grow elderly population , increase prevalence hypertension ischemic heart disease ( major cause heart failure ) , heart failure become major health care issue globally . In western country incidence range 1 10 cases/1000/year . Other study suggest heart failure large grow public health burden throughout Europe . Acute exacerbation heart failure symptom common emergency department ( ED ) presentation know acute decompensated heart failure ( adHF ) . Acute decompensated heart failure represent single great cost US hospital fund Medicaid . In Hong Kong ( HK ) , incidence rate heart failure 3-3.8/1000/year rise 20/1000/year woman age 85 year recent year . It estimate 7 % acute medical admission due condition . In recent year 10 % annual increase admission patient adHF . Currently Hong Kong , vast majority ED patient adHF admit inpatient hospital . In 2005 , audit outcome patient acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema , severe manifestation heart failure , present emergency department Prince Wales Hospital show nearly 30 % patient die within 30 day , 30 % require readmission within 30 day . Recent evidence USA suggest ED operate observation unit effective manage low medium risk adHF patient , reduce length stay ( LOS ) patient without adversely affect readmission rate , morbidity mortality . 2 Dimensional echocardiography ( 2D-echo ) conventional standard-of-care tool non-invasive hemodynamic assessment adult . In stable setting , heart failure often characterize classified accord ejection fraction measure echocardiography may consider pragmatic gold standard . However , use 2D-echo require highly trained personnel . Obtaining measurement calculate fundamental cardiovascular parameter cardiac output ( CO ) may take anywhere 30 45 minute , impractical setting , let alone acute care set . Further , personnel frequently available emergency department . The feasibility real time haemodynamic assessment therefore limit 2D-echo . More sophisticated echocardiographic technique develop attempt overcome problem sensitivity preload particularly afterload , achieve little penetration critical care . In acute critical care setting , diagnosis adHF base history clinical sign , sometimes aid echocardiography , chest radiography blood marker B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) . The value BNP clinical assessment patient present dyspnoea question need tool improve diagnosis . Commencement , dosing , withdrawal vasopressor , vasodilator , inotropes still largely base clinical assessment , sometimes assisted measurement surrogate inotropy ejection fraction ( EF ) aortic ejection velocity , despite well-known shortcoming index critical care . This particularly complex surgical patient vascular tone fluid load status highly variable change . Heart failure abnormality cardiac structure function leading failure heart deliver oxygen rate commensurate requirement metabolize tissue , despite normal filling pressure ( expense increase filling pressure ) . The common cause hypertension ischemic heart disease . If definition hold , heart failure associate measure reduction inotropy oxygen delivery . Until recently simple non-invasive , bedside test could aid assessment patient heart failure . Whilst inotropy ( myocardial contractility ) concept well know clinician , seldom think measurable quantity . USCOM introduce non-invasive bedside haemodynamic monitoring tool utilizes continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound . The USCOM number advantage . It accuracy , validity reasonable precision confirm many study variety context . It easily portable , take several minute obtain reliable measurement case , conduct trained physician nurse . Some study show good agreement USCOM echocardiography others less convince . With mind , still need study confirm refute level agreement USCOM echocardiography . The potential utility USCOM assess patient adHF recently suggest . Inotropy measurement derive USCOM greatly reduce patient New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV American Heart association ( AHA ) stage C , acute leave ventricular failure , compare healthy control . These finding lead proposal USCOM measure inotropy , could use assess manage heart failure . Although inotropy , derive USCOM , low patient adHF NYHA class IV , nevertheless evidence dose-relationship USCOM-derived inotropy NYHA class , correlation increase severity adHF , ejection fraction . Many , , emergency department throughout world 2D-echo available 24 hour day , . The value BNP test improve outcome question even use , frequently available many hospital . As assessment diagnosis heart failure , mean monitor effect therapy , constitute major unmet need clinical practice especially emergency department . Aim The overall aim study investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameter may diagnostic , risk-stratification , prognostic therapeutic monitoring potential patient suspect heart failure . The specific objective : 1 . To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameter CO , inotropy oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) role diagnosis patient compensate heart failure syndrome ( cHFS ) acute decompensated heart failure syndrome ( adHFS ) 2 . To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameter CO , inotropy DO2 correlate heart failure staging , especially NYHA class AHA stage . 3 . To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameter velocity time interval ( vti ) , stroke volume ( SV ) , CO , SV index ( SVI ) , CO index ( CI ) , inotropy DO2 correlate ejection fraction . 4 . To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variable may use prognostic indicator 30-day , 6-month 1-year Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) . 5 . To evaluate agreement hemodynamic measurement obtain use Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor ( USCOM® ; USCOM Ltd. , Sydney , Australia ) , reference standard determine 2D-echo measurement group haemodynamically stable unstable adult patient . Data collection measurable parameter - Demographics include sex , age , height weight - Chief complaint , concurrent illness significant past history - Clinical sign include respiration rate , heart rate , systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , oxygen saturation CGS . - USCOM derive haemodynamic parameter - Full blood examination , urea electrolyte , arterial venous blood gas , blood glucose , lactate , BNP , ECG chest x-ray - ED diagnosis , disposition ED , hospital length stay , ICU length stay , hospital diagnosis in-hospital mortality All data enter database securely store access investigator . Definition haemodynamic parameter : - Flow time correct ( FTc ) calculate use Bazett 's formula : FTc = FT/√tHR , tHR = heart beat period second ( ) . The unit FTc ms. - Velocity time integral ( vti ) integral flow profile , i.e . distance blood travel one beat . The unit vti m/s . - Cardiac output ( CO ) volume blood pump heart one minute : CO = SV x HR . The unit l/min . - Cardiac index ( CI ) equal CO divide BSA . The unit l/min/m2 . - Inotropy index refers ( Potential energy + Kinetic energy ) divide body surface area . The unit inotropy W/m2 . - Minute distance ( MD ) distance blood cell travel metre per minute ( m/min ) . MD = HR x vti , vti = velocity time integral stroke distance , distance centimetre ( cm ) single reflector travel per cycle , define area flow . - Stroke volume ( SV ) volume blood eject heart one systolic stroke . SV = vti x πr2 , πr2 = flow cross sectional area . The unit SV ml . - Stroke volume index ( SVI ) SV divide BSA unit ml/m2 . - Stroke volume variation ( SVV ) percentage change SV group beat . SVV = ( SVmax - SVmin x 100 ) / [ ( SVmax + SVmin ) /2 ] . - Systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) pressure heart pump . SVR = MAP/CO . The unit d.s.cm-5 . - Systemic vascular resistance index ( SVRI ) SVRI = SVR x BSA d.s.cm-5m2 . - Oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) calculate equation : DO2 = 1.34 x Hb x SpO2/100 x CO , Hb = hemoglobin gram hemoglobin per litre blood ( g/l ) ; SpO2 = peripheral oxygen saturation percentage ( % ) . The unit DO2 ml/min . - Oxygen delivery index ( DO2I ) equal DO2 divide BSA . The unit DO2I ml/min/m2 . - Inotropy index refers ( Potential energy + Kinetic energy ) divide body surface area . The unit inotropy W/m2 . This project provide essential data potential clinician without access echocardiography access USCOM , effectively safely assess patient cHF , adHF . Confirming value USCOM enable early diagnosis heart failure cardiogenic shock , earlier appropriate management , remove guesswork uncertainty whether administer diuretic , intravenous fluid , vasodilator , vasoconstrictor , inotropes , chronotropes blocker . This open door trial orientate optimize haemodynamics cold acute critical care setting , thus permit optimal use life-saving therapy , optimize survival . Such early treatment option reduce need admission hospital length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
