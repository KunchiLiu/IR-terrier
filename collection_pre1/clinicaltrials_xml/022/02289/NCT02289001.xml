	<brief_title>Simulation Training Undergraduate Nursing Education Means Improve Awareness Team Member Roles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Students assign intervention group receive one hour additional training teamwork skill , communication team member , relationship patient safety , well distribute role responsibility use SBAR worksheet . They give material use present training session ( PowerPoint slide , video , SBAR worksheet ) order avoid share information directly student control group . Training provide Intervention Group 1 . Basic competency healthcare professional ( Institute Medicine , IOM , 2003 ) work team member ( Interprofessional Education Collaborative ( IPEC ) . Core competencies Interprofessional Collaborative Practice . 2011 . Available : http : //www.aacn.nche.edu/education-resources/ipecreport.pdf ) 2 . Use SBAR ( Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation ) worksheet accordance Kaiser Permanente Guidelines Communicating Physicians Using SBAR Process . Available : http : //fliptheclinic.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/community_uploads/1598/SBAR % 20Guidelines % 20Kaiser % 20Permanente.pdf . Accessed Oct 17 , 2014 ) : 3 . Distribution role responsibility interdisciplinary care team critical patient ( airway management , assessment nurse/physician , medication nurse , procedure nurse , document nurse ) On day clinical practice schedule , accord 2014-2015 academic year , student report simulation laboratory . All student study arm participate simulate scenario , case validate National League Nursing , set mimic emergency department critical patient ( HPS ) state shock . Three nursing student medical student intervene scenario . If scenario require additional intervention guide student redirect situation reach impasse , professor prepare take role emergency room physician nursing supervisor . Students receive complementary training ( i.e. , control group ) direct different laboratory intervention group wait call participation simulate scenario . Ten minute begin scenario , group ( control intervention ) receive document correspond simulated patient 's clinical history . Students intervention group also print SBAR worksheet , familiar complementary training . This worksheet mixed document related patient 's clinical history professor participate scenario evaluation readily able identify study arm participate give scenario . A professor randomize scenario , follow code deliver sealed envelope previously assign number directly link correspond study arm ( intervention , control ) . The envelope keep locked box simulation laboratory , open day clinical practice professor involve study . Sample size To calculate necessary sample , consider difference median observe previous study population ( Raurell-Torredà M , Olivet-Pujol J , Romero-Collado A , Malagon-Aguilera MC , Patiño-Masó , J , Baltasar-Bagué A. Case-based learn simulation : useful tool enhance nurse ' education ? Non-randomized control trial '' . J Nurs Scholarsh . 2014 , Oct 25. doi : 10.1111/jnu.12113 ) . The standardized median difference 0.9 point . With aim obtain difference present study , accept alpha risk 0.05 beta risk le 20 % two-tailed test , estimate sample size 21 scenario arm study . Statistical analysis Qualitative variable express frequency percentage , use Chi square Fisher test compare group , appropriate . Quantitative variable show mean standard deviation ( SD ) median interquartile range ( P25-P75 ) , depend normality distribution , group compare use Student Mann-Whitney U test , respectively . A P-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . All analyse do use IBM SPSS Statistics ( IBM Statistics® , Markham , ON , Canada ) . Given impossibility predict student participate simulation would behave , loss follow-up manage per protocol rather intention treat .</detailed_description>
