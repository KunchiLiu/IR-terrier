	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , control trial pregnant woman present prenatal care Parkland Health Hospital System . The participant limited woman undergo cesarean section high risk wound complication : patient BMI &gt; 40 undergoing cesarean section . The primary outcome wound complication define wound disruption wound infection . A wound disruption define partial complete opening deep subcutaneous space , include superficial skin separation . Underlying cause include seroma , hematoma , abscess , facial dehiscence . Wound infection define physician diagnosis wound infection erythema warmth extend beyond immediate area adjacent incision require treatment antibiotic . All patient BMI &gt; 40 undergo schedule cesarean section patient BMI &gt; 40 admit labor approach participate study . If patient meet criterion undergo cesarean section , randomize negative pressure wound therapy standard dressing . All labor treatment , pre-operative antibiotic , surgical technique , post-operative care differ current standard care . All patient randomize include study . All study participant thickness subcutaneous tissue measure sterile ruler . Patients randomize NPWT negative pressure wound therapy system place incision per manufacturer 's protocol . All patient randomize standard dress customary dress gauze surgical tape place incision . The investigator utilize single use negative pressure wound therapy system study . Single use negative pressure wound therapy system compose pressure pump dress kit . The pump create negative pressure 125 mmHg ( +/- 20 mgHg ) dress directly cover surgical incision . The system battery-powered design use minimum two day maximum seven day continuous use . All randomized patient undergo examination incision research physician nurse prior discharge . The NPWT remove prior discharge post-operative day seven , whichever come first . All postpartum patient undergo cesarean delivery inpatient least post-operative day three continue use NPWT day discharge . In patient randomized standard dressing , dress remove prior discharge per current standard care . All randomized patient also undergo 2 week post-operative incisional examination research physician nurse obstetrical complication clinic . Patients follow 30 day postpartum wound complication include wound infection ( superficial deep ) , readmission hospital , re-operation wound complication , hematoma , seroma , dehiscence , superficial infection require antibiotic , additional clinical evaluation wound care emergency room clinic setting . A research physician nurse contact least 30 day post-operative confirm patient ' status ensure evaluation , admission , intervention do outside facility . Subjects exit study unable complete post-operative visit withdrawal consent participation .</detailed_description>
