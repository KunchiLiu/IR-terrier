	<detailed_description>This , open-label , protocol design evaluate activity target therapy anaplastic/undifferentiated thyroid cancer . Arm A evaluate ATC/UTC mutation rearrangement detect ALK gene . There effective treatment anaplastic thyroid cancer locally recurrent metastatic setting . Ceritinib administer patient disease progression RECIST 1.1 , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , discontinuation trial reason . The primary focus arm protocol identify ceritinib 's activity anaplastic undifferentiated thyroid cancer patient . Those patient mutation identify ALK gene sequence tumor sample , establish ALK abnormality treat ALK-inhibitors . These include Ventana assay Vysis FISH probe , patient tumor positive assay also consider eligible therapy trial . The goal multi-center , multi-arm trial measure impact treat metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer patient target therapy select patient due presence genetic mutation aberration . This trial serve framework new biomarker-drug combination identify add new arm . Therapeutic Portion : ARM A : ALK Abnormality IND Ceritinib 750 mg orally daily Day 1 Continue q4 week x 2 cycle Primary Endpoint : The development progression ; new recurrence distant metastasis , well enlargement exist metastasis radiographic imaging . CT scan neck , chest , abdomen pelvis perform baseline every two cycle ( cycle 28 day long ) accord standard care . Other image area PET/MRI allow CT perform . MRI brain perform baseline clinically indicate . Wherever safely give , radiographic contrast agent give image study . Secondary Endpoints : 1 . Overall response rate patient treat ceritinib part study . 2 . Death study participant due cause .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis anaplastic thyroid cancer undifferentiated thyroid cancer demonstrate mutation ALK gene assess sequence tumor specimen Arm A . Other ALK abnormality detect approved FISH test ( Abbott Molecular Inc ) , use Vysis breakapart probe ( define 15 % positive tumor cell ) ; Ventana IHC test also see evidence ALK abnormality meeting eligibility requirement . 2 . Patients curative therapeutic option , radiation surgery . 3. WHO performance status 02 . 4 . Age great equal 18 year . 5 . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy ≤ Grade 2 ( CTCAE v 4.03 ) , provide concomitant medication give prior initiation treatment ceritinib . Exception criterion : patient grade alopecia allow enter treatment . 6 . Adequate organ function : follow laboratory criterion meet : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 8 g/dL Platelets great equal 75 x 109/L Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , except patient Gilbert 's syndrome may include total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; 2.0 x ULN , except patient liver metastasis , include AST &lt; 3 x ULN ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.0 x ULN , except patient liver metastasis , include ALT &lt; 3 x ULN Calculated measure creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) less equal 30 mL/min 7 . Patient must follow laboratory value follow laboratory value correct supplement within normal limit screen : Potassium ≥ LLN Magnesium ≥ LLN Phosphorus ≥ LLN Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ≥ LLN 8 . Written inform consent protocol must obtain prior screen procedure . 9 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test procedure . Patients eligible must meet following criterion : 1 . Patients know hypersensitivity excipients ceritinib ( microcrystalline cellulose , mannitol , crospovidone , colloidal silicon dioxide magnesium stearate ) . 2 . Patients symptomatic CNS metastasis neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid within 1 week prior study entry manage CNS symptom . 3 . Prior therapy ceritinib . 4 . Presence history malignant disease thyroid cancer diagnose and/or require therapy within past year undergo active anticancer treatment . Exceptions exclusion include follow : completely resect basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , completely resect carcinoma situ type . 5 . Patients known history extensive disseminate bilateral interstitial fibrosis interstitial lung disease , include history pneumonitis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , interstitial pneumonia , obliterative bronchiolitis , clinically significant radiation pneumonitis ( i.e . affect activity daily live require therapeutic intervention ) . 6 . Patient clinically significant , uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac event ( within 6 month ) , : unstable angina within 6 month prior screen ; myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen ; history document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) ; uncontrolled hypertension define Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or Diastolic Blood Pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 100 mm Hg , without antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) allow prior screening ; ventricular arrhythmia ; supraventricular nodal arrhythmia control medication ; cardiac arrhythmia control medication ; correct QTc &gt; 450 msec use Fridericia correction screen ECG 7 .

Ongoing GI adverse event &gt; grade 2 ( e.g . nausea , vomit , diarrhea ) start study . 9 . Receiving medication meet one follow criterion discontinue least 1 week prior start treatment ceritinib duration participation ( see Appendix 1 Tables ) : Medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( please refer http : //www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/druglists.cfm ) Strong inhibitor strong inducer CYP3A4/5 ( please refer http : //medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm http : //www.druginteractioninfo.org ) Medications low therapeutic index primarily metabolize CYP3A4/5 , CYP2C8 and/or CYP2C9 ( please refer http : //medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm http : //www.druginteractioninfo.org ) Therapeutic dose warfarin sodium ( Coumadin ) coumadinderived anticoagulant . Anticoagulants derive warfarin allow ( eg , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban ) . Unstable increase dos corticosteroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsive agent herbal supplement 10 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test . 11 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose agree continue 3 month last dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment . Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject .
