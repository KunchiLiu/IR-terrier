	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause death United States , improve CVD risk assessment need personalized medicine . Atherosclerosis measure include plaque volume adverse plaque feature prognostic value . Novel technique develop assess carotid , coronary , femoral atherosclerosis use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method rapid reproducible , improved spatial resolution , require contrast medium , make atherosclerosis assessment multiple vascular bed feasible single MRI session . This pilot research provide preliminary data develop innovative global atherosclerosis measure include carotid , coronary , femoral vascular bed , assess cardiovascular risk monitor atherosclerosis response therapy . 20 participant recruit one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 2 study visit study . During first visit , investigator obtain non-contrast MRI ( carotid , coronary , femoral ) 20 subject know coronary atherosclerosis vary degree CVD risk . 1 . 5 asymptomatic subject low CVD risk ( recent coronary artery calcium score [ CACS ] 10-299 ) 2 . 5 asymptomatic subject higher CVD risk ( CACS 300-1000 ) 3 . 5 subject know coronary atherosclerosis stable angina 4 . 5 subject know atherosclerosis recent acute myocardial infarction The investigator measure plaque volume assess adverse plaque feature ( intra-plaque hemorrhage , positive remodeling , lesion eccentricity ) three vascular bed . Eight subject evidence large plaque burden MRI ask return simultaneous positron emission tomography ( PET ) -MRI image 18F-sodium fluoride ( 18F-NaF ) carotid , coronary , femoral artery , 18F-NaF uptake plaque represent micro-calcifications , associate high-risk plaque . In 20 subject , investigator also measure follow biomarkers show useful CVD risk assessment atherosclerosis : LDL , HDL , lipoprotein ( ) , apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio , hemoglobin A1c , adiponectin , highly sensitive C-reactive protein . The investigator also calculate estimate 10-year lifetime atherosclerotic CVD risk ( American Heart Association ) , Framingham 10-year CVD risk , Reynolds 10-year CVD risk score . We aim obtain second scan within 3 month first visit ; thus , subject participate study approximately 3 month . All procedures research-related . The research visit take approximately 3 hour , maximum two visit . There collaboration site .</detailed_description>
