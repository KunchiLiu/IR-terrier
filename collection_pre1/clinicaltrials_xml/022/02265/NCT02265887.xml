	<detailed_description>Title : Implementation PAPUCO Registry Background PAPUCO Registry The Sub-Saharan Task Force Pulmonary Hypertension , leadership Dr Ana Olga Mocumbi Prof. Sliwa , establish January 2010 . The primary aim Task Force establish Sub-Saharan African Registry Pulmonary Hypertension ( PHT ) , subsequently , research educational awareness project . PHT devastating , progressive disease , increasingly debilitate symptom , usually , shorten overall life expectancy . The epidemiology PHT Sub-Saharan Africa yet determine , limited report suggest incidence higher report develop country , owe pattern disease prevalent region . Many known factor PHT hyperendemic part world , include Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome , schistosomiasis , chronic hepatitis B C Sickle Cell Disease . On hand , high prevalence tuberculosis , poorly treat asthma , high level pollution urban area exposure mining , subsequently lead various form pulmonary hypertension , often , right heart failure premature death . Lack adequate paediatric service deal congenital heart disease lead pulmonary hypertension , secondary pulmonary hypertension , commonly see , due high prevalence rheumatic heart disease endomyocardial fibrosis However , detailed information currently available , thus also lead poor awareness devastate problem , Sub-Saharan Africa , worldwide . There , therefore , urgent need research demographic , natural history survival patient pulmonary hypertension . Filling gap knowledge need effectively detect , manage prevent pulmonary hypertension region . The first Sub-Saharan Pulmonary Vascular Hypertension Workshop take place Friday 23rd Saturday 24th April 2010 , Hatter Cardiovascular Research Institute , Chris Barnard Building , Faculty Health Sciences , University Cape Town . We colleague South Africa , Africa ( Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Nigeria , Kenya , Sudan , Tanzania ) , United Kingdom ( Prof Butrous ) , Australia ( Prof Simon Stewart ) USA ( Dr Lori Blauwet ) participate workshop . The area discipline participate member range basic scientist , adult paediatric cardiologist , pulmonologists cardiothoracic surgeon . We use workshop plan PHT registry Africa , auspices Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute-Sub-Saharan Taskforce . The main objective research describe epidemiology pulmonary hypertension among patient attend referral unit cardiovascular pulmonary disease African country . This information crucial development effective resource-sensitive strategy tackle PHT Sub-Saharan Africa . The first step direction build registry patient PHT , attend range hospital several country region . Study Protocol . Objective : To describe epidemiology characteristic pulmonary hypertension sub-Saharan Africa Population : 250 patient pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) reside sub-Saharan Africa enrol registry . Each participate center enroll minimum twenty five consecutive patient base follow eligibility criterion . Eligibility criterion : The registry aim recruit consecutive patient 1. newly diagnose PH-based clinical ECHO criterion , 2. able likely return 6-month follow-up , 3. least 18 year old ( except paediatric centre Mozambique Nigeria ) 4. consent write participate registry . Centre eligibility include 1. availability ECHO train asses- sing right heart function , 2. experience diagnosing PH accord WHO classiÔ¨Åcation , 3. experience clinical management patient RHF 4. resource review patient 6-month follow-up . Participating centre invite join registry African cardiac meeting conference . Recruitment : Eight center 4 country ( Cameroon , Mozambique , Nigeria , South Africa ) recruit patient . Study Duration : Recruitment expect complete 12 24 month . Follow-up continue minimum 6 month enrollment . Study Design : This prospective observational study . Study Procedures : 1 . Completion standardize questionnaire collect epidemiological clinical data 2 . Echocardiographic assessment , include standardized assessment right ventricular function 3 . Collection peripheral blood assessment routine blood investigation serum biomarkers ( select center , shipment Hatter Institute funding secure ) 4 . Data entry web-based data system upload file ECG , echocardiography , chest X-ray image . Source document store trial site . KEY ROLES Project Coordinators : Leaders Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute Sub-Saharan Africa ( PVRI SSA ) Task Force [ Ana Mocumbi ( Mozambique ) Karen Sliwa ( Cape Town ) ] serve project coordinator . The Hatter Cardiovascular Research Institute function coordinate centre store serum sample minus 80 degree freezer . Principal Investigators : One person participate country designate serve Principal Investigator country .
