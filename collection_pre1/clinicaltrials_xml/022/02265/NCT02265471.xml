	<brief_title>Knowledge Perception Resistance Antimicrobials Among Healthcare Workers France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The landscape antibiotic resistance hospital dramatically evolve past 10 year , rapid change multidrug resistant organism ( MDROs ) , i.e . decrease rate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) increase prevalence Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) - produce Enterobacteriaceae community hospital , emergence highly resistant bacteria ( HRB ) especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( VRE ) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae ( CPE ) often import foreign country . Schematically , control bacterial resistance base modulation antibiotic prescription interruption HRB MDRO cross-transmission . Many recommendation recently issue management patient carry HRB MDRO , level knowledge implementation health care facility ( HCF ) remain unclear . Knowledge perception resistance antimicrobial among health care worker ( HCW ) influence individual societal determinant , professional environment personal experience . The willing improve antimicrobial resistance awareness change behavior require accurate overview knowledge perception HCW within French health care setting . OBJECTIVES The main objective determine level antimicrobial resistance knowledge among HCWs France . The secondary objective : 1 ) determine antimicrobial resistance perception HCW France ; 2 ) measure impact HCF organisation perception knowledge HCW ; 3 ) identify analyse driver barrier change . MATERIALS AND METHODS The methodology use cross-sectional survey one day self-administered questionnaire semi-structured interview HCW ( doctor , nurse aide , employ training , directly participate care ) . This survey implement random sample representative French HCFs . The questionnaire include data HCF individual data respondent evaluation regard : knowledge HCW ( landscape resistance , role control cross-transmission , role selective pressure cause antibiotic ) , perception antimicrobial resistance ( use Health Belief Model ) , measure organization 's workplace culture ( base leadership , commitment , team communication level stress / chaos ) . Semi-structured interview plan complement assessment . JUDGING CRITERIA The main criterion level knowledge binary encoding . The secondary criterion base psycho-social-cognitive determinant knowledge perception culture organisation . INCLUSIONS Six type HCF ( university hospital , large small public hospital , private HCFs , referral center cancer , mixed group local hospital , long term care post-op rehabilitation facility , nurse home 5 interregional coordination center infection control ( CCLIN ) . All eligible HCWs work survey day include . A minimum 2,100 HCW require properly estimate rate HCW minimum core knowledge ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Actually , large number 5,000 10,000 participant include . All HCWs , employ training , work day survey ( day night ) select HCF include except health worker involve direct care , non-medical staff nurse nurse auxiliary .</detailed_description>
