	<brief_summary>Pulmonary contusion ( PC ) significant problem blunt trauma may often lead acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) patient , death . Although pathophysiology incompletely understood , clear biochemical process involve change inflammatory milieu contusion occur addition simple direct mechanical injury lung . The relationship severity contusion imaging , disturbances inflammatory phenotype , outcome unknown . This prospective , observational study evaluate size severity contusion measure chest compute tomography ( CT ) . Inflammatory mediator measure bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) serum patient pulmonary contusion define inflammatory nature post-contusion lung . The degree abnormality within inflammatory parameter correlate lung contusion size subsequent patient outcome . These data compare patient group : 1 ) Trauma patient without chest injury mechanically ventilate ; 2 ) Uninjured patient undergo elective surgical procedure require intubation mechanical ventilation ; 3 ) Patients Medical ICU mechanically ventilate acute respiratory failure . The hypothesis test within study resolution lung injury dependent upon presence Tregs alveolar space .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center enroll 40 patient PC study group , 20 patient control group , 20 MICU patient . Recruitment occur two year . The sample size determine identify mean number patient PC admit ( 38 ) WFUBMC per year . Using Whittemore 's formula , sample size adequate detect significant odds ratio 5 ( alpha &lt; 0.05 ) respect increase acute lung injury ARDS risk patient &gt; 20 % total lung volume contusion approximately 85 % power . The odds ratio population develop acute lung injury ARDS previous study 16.666 . Eligible subject study group patient PC admission CT ; eligible subject control group # 1 ( CG1 ) non-injured patient without PC undergo standard general surgical procedure ; eligible subject control group # 2 ( CG2 ) non-chest , non-PC trauma patient admit intubated trauma ICU ; eligible MICU subject patient mechanical ventilation admit Medical ICU acute respiratory failure . Informed consent study group , CG2 , MICU group generally obtain family member patient unconscious sedate . If patient alert , study explain patient family . Informed consent CG1 obtain patient family member Surgery Clinic prior elective procedure . An initial blood sample obtain person study group , CG2 , , patient ventilate , BAL obtain sign informed consent patient LAR . Blood sample pulmonary sample obtain CG1 patient obtain sign informed consent , operate theater , sedate intubated , though elective procedure . Blood pulmonary sample obtain MICU subject obtain sign informed consent .</detailed_description>
