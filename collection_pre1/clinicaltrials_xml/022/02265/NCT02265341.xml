	<brief_title>Ponatinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Biliary Cancer With FGFR2 Fusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical benefit rate ( confirm complete partial response stable disease 4 cycle ) ponatinib ( ponatinib hydrochloride ) fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) aberrant advance biliary cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression free survival , overall survival , cancer antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9 ) response rate patient . II . To estimate adverse event profile ponatinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish preliminary correlation FGFR2 fusion evidence clinical benefit . II . Assess preliminary evaluation FGFR2 pathway perturbation ponatinib . III . To describe patient-reported health-related quality life symptom . OUTLINE : Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month least 2 year .</detailed_description>
