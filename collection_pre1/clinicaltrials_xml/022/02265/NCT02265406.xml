	<brief_summary>Ventilation-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) main site healthcare-associated infection brain injured patient , incidence rate 22 % 58 % . VAP increase morbi-mortality , length stay intensive care overall management cost . The prevention ICU nosocomial infection depend several measure : orotracheal intubation route , maintain tube cuff pressure 25 30 cm H2O , maintain semi-seated position &gt; = 30° , nasal oropharyngeal care regular interval , strive avoid unscheduled extubation , use write sedation-analgesia algorithm allow early weaning ventilation . Two randomize study show administration antibiotic therapy intubation reduces risk early VAP incidence . However , clinical practice , administration solely purpose limit VAP occurence presently recommend . Indeed , date placebo blind control study realize fear development bacterial resistance remain strong efficiency prevention measure . This aim present study show placebo randomize study 2g Ceftriaxone within 8 hour post-intubation brain injury decrease risk occurence early VAP .</brief_summary>
