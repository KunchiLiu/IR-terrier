	<brief_summary>Currently official data concern incidence , progression prognosis patient lymphoma Brazil.This project aim establishment network 12 Brazilian Institutions implement Lymphoma Registry ( RELINFO ) Brazilian National Cancer Institute ( INCA ) Coordinating Center.We intend develop implement computerized system data entry information management patient lymphomas . This enable create virtual registry demographic , clinical , epidemiological , histopathological , molecular , therapeutic data . This clinical record must link histopathological molecular diagnosis , allow institution work context public health system access new technology early cancer diagnosis.We expect record reliably portray scene lymphoma state become management model replicate national level . Thus , implementation RELINFO strengthen multidisciplinary diagnosis , promote standardization clinical record patient lymphomas provide subsidy cooperative research project participate institution .</brief_summary>
