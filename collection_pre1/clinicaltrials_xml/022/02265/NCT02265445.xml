	<brief_title>Deescalating Carbapenems Hospital Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carbapenems consider antibiotic choice treatment infection due expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase produce Enterobacteriaceae ( ESBL-PE ) . Their use readily increase pandemic ESBL-PE . However , future drug challenge worldwide emergency new resistance mechanism pathogen , particularly carbapenemases . This resistance make drug inactive give therapeutic option patient . Resistance carbapenems strongly associate use drug , large spectrum strong impact host flora . Consequently , correct use drug important public health objective . In France , CA-SFM ( Committee Antimicrobial French Society Microbiology ) suggest alternative strategy narrow spectrum beta-lactam treatment ESBL-PE infection , include 3rd 4th cephalosporin , cefoxitin penicillin beta-lactamase inhibitor . A recent analysis include 6 prospective cohort study bloodstream infection due ESBL-producing Escherichia coli find excess mortality longer length hospital stay patient receive penicillin beta-lactamase inhibitor , compare patient treat carbapenems , adjust confound factor . As patient receive carbapenems seem severely affect , efficacy safety alternative strategy remain unproved . A randomized study therefore need evaluate deescalating therapeutic strategy ( switch carbapenem another beta-lactam isolate pathogen susceptible ) patient well-defined ESBL-PE infection ( usual site infection non severe infection ) . The objective present study demonstrate alternative strategy deescalating therapy inferior strategy maintain carbapenem term clinical cure , survival , lack relapse microbiological cure .</detailed_description>
