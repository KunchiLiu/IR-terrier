	<brief_summary>Severe Alcoholic hepatitis ( SAH ) , define modify Maddrey 's Discriminant Function ( DF ) ≥32 , associate significant morbidity mortality . Of various treatment modality evaluate treatment SAH , corticosteroid extensively study . Five 13 RCTs , four 5 meta-analysis show survival benefit corticosteroid , especially patient DF ≥32 and/ encephalopathy.However , role corticosteroid SAH still remain somewhat controversial . Corticosteroid therapy consider ideal option author beneficial effect seem confine highly select minority group inhibitory effect corticosteroid liver inflammation outweigh side effect weaken defence infection , anti-anabolic effect , possible ulcer promote effect . Also corticosteroid contraindicate patient renal failure , gastro-intestinal ( GI ) bleed , pancreatitis active sepsis . Therefore , constant effort evaluate new therapy SAH . In recent trial , combination glucocorticoid plus N-acetylcysteine find improve one month survival patient SAH , compare glucocorticoid alone . However 6 month survival different group . Human Colostrum ( HC ) Bovine Colostrum ( BC ) rich protein , immunoglobulin , lactoferrin growth factor . Recent study suggest colostrum component , Lactroferrin , immunoglobulin growth factor benefit physically active person treatment autoimmune disorder . It use treatment wide variety gastrointestinal condition , include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gut injury , H pylorus infection , immune deficiency relate diarrhea well infective diarrhea . The guideline American College Gastroenterology author suggest combination CS drug , different mechanism action , may beneficial reduce mortality SAH . Hence , plan conduct pilot study investigate efficacy novel combination corticosteroid , Bovine colostrum treatment SAH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe alcoholic hepatitis associate significant morbidity mortality . Diagnosis : The diagnosis ( AH ) make follow criteria11 I.Chronic active alcohol abuse - &gt; 80 gram male &gt; 20 gram female . II . Duration jaundice &lt; 3 month III . Serum Bilirubin &gt; 5 mg/dl IV . AST/ALT &gt; 2:1 V. AST &lt; 500 IU/L , ALT &lt; 300 IU/L VI . Neutrophilic leucocytosis VII . Alcohol - non - alcohol index ( ANI ) determine aetiology obese patient drink excessively . The ANI use body mass index , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , AST/ALT ratio gender determine whether aetiology alcoholic steatohepatitis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . A high MCV , AST/ALT ratio &gt; 1 , low BMI male gender favour alcohol aetiology , reflect positive ANI score . A negative score implicates NASH cause liver disease . The ANI calculator available online ( http : //www.mayoclinic.org/girst/mayomodel10.html ) VIII . Ethyl Glucuronide urine12 detects alcohol intake within last 3 day IX . Ethyl Glucuronide hair13 detects intake alcohol within last month X. Serum Enzyme link immunosorbent Ethyl Glucuronide sensitivity specificity 92 % 91 % respectively XI . Liver biopsy useful diagnosis uncertain corticosteroid give treatment SAH . A Transjugular liver biopsy perform patient due coagulopathy SAH . Assessment Severity Maddrey 's Discriminant Function14 Discriminant Function Index ( DFI ) originally describe Maddrey colleague placebo control study ass benefit corticosteroid patient AH . The original formula 4.6 x prothrombin time ( PT ) ( second ) + serum Bilirubin ( mg/dl ) . It observe patient DFI &gt; 93 treat placebo 28 day survival 25 % , whereas DFI &lt; 93 100 % survival . Subsequently score modify 19896 call Modified Discriminant Function ( MDF ) . MDF = 4.6 x ( Patient 's PT - Control PT ) + serum bilirubin ( mg/dl ) . Untreated patient MDF &gt; 32 survival 68 % . The American College Gastroenterology9 recommend patient MDF &gt; 32 / Encephalopathy ( SAH ) treat Corticosteroids . The prothrombin time varies greatly depend sensitivity thromboplastin reagent use test . This drawback MDF . MELD score15 The model end stage liver disease ( MELD ) score predicts survival patient cirrhosis use prioritize patient liver transplantation . MELD score = ( 0.957 x log serum creatinine + 0.378 x log serum bilirubin + 1.120 x log INR + 0.643 ) x 10 . The advantage MELD score use INR place PT . The INR comparable uniform across laboratory worldwide . The American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) recommend MELD score &gt; 20 predicts SAH criterion initiate treatment . Serial monitoring MELD score change 2 point first week treatment independently predict mortality . GAHS score16 Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score ( GAHS ) include age , peripheral Total Leucocyte Count , serum Bilirubin ( day 1 6-9 ) , blood urea nitrogen PT . It good predictor mortality 28 day MDF . GAHS score &gt; 9 extremely poor prognosis unless treated Corticosteroids . The drawback lack international validation . Child - Turcotte - Pugh score17 It traditionally use predict mortality SAH . However , help predict mortality 3 6 month . Treatment Abstinence alcohol This important factor predict outcome survive acute alcoholic hepatitis ( AH ) episode . The incidence recidivism recovery first episode AH varies 10 - 70 % . Nutrition Enteral nutrition prefer mode supplemental nutrition . It cheap , maintain gut mucosal integrity . This turn decrease risk bacterial endotoxin translocation result less infection endotoxemia . Pooled data 5 RCT 's AH demonstrate improved nutritional status compare standard dietary intake , without improve survival rates.18 Pharmacotherapy Corticosteroids Corticosteroids ( CS ) extensively use treatment SAH . 6/13 RCT 's 4/6 meta-analysis support use CS SAH . The last meta-analysis individual patient data 5 high quality RCT 's use CS SAH conclude CS confers 50 % relative survival benefit 1 month ( 85 % versus 65 % survival amongst treat CS versus untreated patient . The number patient need treat ( NNT ) 5 reduce one death . Oral Prednisolone 40mg daily parenteral methylprednisolone ( patient unable take orally ) 32 mg intravenously daily 4 week standard therapy . The CS taper next 4 week . A Lille score &gt; 0.45 7 day treatment CS indication non-response , increased susceptibility infection diminish survival19 . The CS stop lilli score &gt; 0.45 . Pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline phosphodiesterase inhibitor . It give orally dose 400mg thrice day 28 day . In pivotal study 101 patient SAH21 , associate survival benefit 50 % . In another study , find superior CS20 . In recent study involve 50 patient center21 , find 20 % vs 40 % mortality patient treat Pentoxifylline versus control , 4 week treatment . Acute kidney injury cause death 20 % compare 70 % patient PTX group versus control . PTX induce recovery renal &amp; hepatic function trend towards increase survival . However , metanalysis 5 RCT fail show benefit PTX22 . The major adverse effect include vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain , headache skin rash . N-Acetylcyteine N-acetylcysteine could value antioxidant treatment acute alcoholic hepatitis , thiol group N-acetylcysteine able reduce level free radical . Administration N-acetylcysteine might reconstitute glutathione stock hepatocytes . At present , N-acetylcysteine use treatment acetaminophen induce hepatitis . Intravenous ( I.V . ) acetylcysteine often used antidote acetaminophen overdose due ability increase level glutathione ; however , also use treat non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure ( NAI-ALF ) severe alcoholic hepatitis prevent contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) . Although i.v . oral formulation acetylcysteine evaluate indication , study examine i.v . form . I.V . acetylcysteine use treatment NAI-ALF improve oxygenation liver . A trial evaluate efficacy glucocorticoid plus N-acetylcysteine , compare glucocorticoid alone , patient severe acute alcoholic hepatitis.23 report improved one month survival combine treatment group . However 6 month survival different two group . Bovine colostrum Human colostrum ( HC ) first milk produce birth particularly rich immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , antimicrobial peptide ( lactoferrin lacto peroxidase ) bioactive molecule , include growth factor important nutrition , growth development newborn infant also passive immunity . Bovine colostrum ( BC ) produce cow first 2 day post parturition . This `` early '' milk nutrient profile immunological composition substantially different 'mature ' milk . It contain macronutrient like protein , carbohydrate , oligosaccharide , fat micronutrient like vitamin mineral , also growth factor , anti-microbial compound immune regulate constituent either present mature milk present substantially low concentration.24,25 Historically colostrum use various illness India well abroad thousand year . Ayurvedic physician India use bovine colostrum medicinal spiritual purpose since cow first domesticate . By late 18th century , Western medicine start take interest colostrum study potential health benefit . As consequence , prescribe many condition , include immune system enhancement . Interestingly , development penicillin artificial antibiotic 20th century , colostrum commonly use fight bacterial infection . In early 20th century note antibody level first milk produce birth much high level find milk produce 72 hour later . There 2000 publish scientific article document safety efficacy use colostrum . This seemingly perfect food show non-species specific26 . In 2005 , report safe effective repair tissue well enhance immunity.27 The use bovine colostrum dietary supplement increase substantially past decade . Bovine colostrum harvest within first hour calve dairy animal . The herd cow keep close supervision good state hygiene without exposure antibody , pesticide anithelmintic . They monitor accord FDA criterion . The colostrum collect within 24 hour contain maximum substance less amount , colostrum collect later contain less immunoglobins.27 Colostrum contain growth factor help build lean muscle , include insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I &amp; IGF-II ) growth hormone ( GH ) . IGF-I , find naturally colostrum , natural hormone capable promote muscle growth . The IGFs human cow identical , bovine colostrum actually contain great concentration IGF-I human colostrum . This fact make bovine colostrum attractive bodybuilder , athletes others seek gain muscle mass . According study conduct Finland , IGF-1 induces protein synthesis , lead increase lean muscle mass without correspond rise adipose ( fat ) tissue . The growth factor colostrum `` shift fuel utilization carbohydrate fat . It mean body burn fat , include fat make carbohydrate protein consume , produce fuel efficiently.28 Bovine hormone factor like gastrin play role trophic factor mucosal growth stomach . GLP-2 show general trophic response gut . Peptide growth factor colostrum influence maintenance mucosal mass integrity . EGF stimulate cell proinfection also influence crypt fission . Human colostrum high concentration growth factor compare bovine colostrum . The table figure indicate HC BC differ nutrient content , immunological factor growth factor ( Table 1 , 2,3 ) While BC consider rich source Ig , growth factor , lactoferrin , currently specific standard exist define BC dietary supplement respect actual constituent amount constituent . The following constituent generally present bovine colostrum : macronutrients ; vitamin ; mineral ; Ig ( IgG , IgM , IgA - include secretory form ) ; cytokine include interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β ) , interleukin- 6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) , interferon-gamma ( INF-γ ) ; growth factor include insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) I II , transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-β ) , epidermal growth factor ; lactoperoxidase ; lactoferrin . Depending health cow , feed practice follow , collection period , processing/concentration practice utilize specific manufacturer , actual range quantity specific macro- micronutrient , Ig , cytokine , growth factor , compound might vary considerably . BC contain relatively high amount Ig . Typically , Ig general , IgG specifically , constitute large contribution protein content BC , lactalbumin casein contribute less amount . Mean percentages fat , protein , lactose colostrum 6.7 , 14.9 , 2.5 , respectively . Other report estimate Ig concentration bovine mammary secretion range IgG1 ( 52-87 g/L ) , IgG2 ( 1.6-2.1 g/L ) , IgM ( 3.7-6.1 g/L ) , IgA ( 3.2-6.2 g/L ) .35 As rule , Ig contribution decline substantially BC collect 24 hour post-parturition amount lactalbumin casein increase proportionately . Table : Immunoglobulin Composition first 10 hour post parturition Constituents Concentration ( g/L ) IgG 30.4 IgA 3.5 IgM 9.6 Detailed research plan ( Materials Methods ) Study design set Twenty five Patients enrol pilot study .
