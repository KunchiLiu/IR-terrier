	<brief_summary>One lead health issue among patient , particularly child , present care low- middle-income country dehydration . When oral rehydration sufficient clinically inappropriate , rehydration often occur intravenously . An alternative intravenous rehydration subcutaneous infusion - without hyaluronidase enzyme ( Hylenex ) - show several robust trial high-income country effective even safer intravenous infusion . In study western Kenya , investigator propose first-ever randomized control trial evaluate whether hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous infusion effective safe IV therapy among moderate-to-severely dehydrated patient low- middle-income country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous ( SC ) infusion establish high-income country safe effective alternative expedite simplify IV access . , A study 2003 demonstrate efficacy SC hydration elderly patient , example . Fluid absorption via SC method almost identical via IV method . A recent retrospective study compare SC fluid infusion IV fluid infusion child show SC method make possible timely delivery parenteral fluid few needlesticks . Additionally , SC hydration show even effective addition recombinant human hyaluronidase , enzyme break hyaluronic acid make extracellular matrix . , ( Note : Hyaluronidase , Hylenex , investigational drug ; FDA-approved , regularly use U.S. , procure study pharmacy Massachusetts General Hospital ( Boston , USA ) . ) When hyaluronidase inject subcutaneously , area form fluids dense matrix cross . Flow rate hyaluronidase-assisted SC ( hSC ) infusion nearly five time faster SC fluid administration alone.8 U.S.-based study compare hSC rehydration standard IV rehydration child mild-to-moderate dehydration demonstrate several benefit hSC , include time success line placement , ease use , satisfaction , cost-effectiveness.9 , These study conclude hSC hydration reasonable alternative IV hydration resource-rich setting , especially child difficult IV access . While hSC infusion show safe , successful , cost-effective high-income country like United States , randomize control trial low-resource setting . The benefit hSC demonstrate high-income country , namely ease use cost-effectiveness , may particularly advantageous low- middle-income country . It may even find safe setting current standard care light recent finding higher mortality IV bolus rehydration among febrile child infection Africa . We , therefore , propose feasibility study evaluate whether hSC infusion effective safe among moderate-to-severely dehydrated patient rural community hospital western Kenya . Rationale hSC infusion improve clinical management patient present moderate-to-severe dehydration . It serve definitive alternative rehydration method bridge IV access IV access unobtainable . Hypotheses Hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous fluid resuscitation equally effective standard IV therapy initial volume resuscitation moderate severely dehydrated patient rural Kenya . Hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous fluid resuscitation decrease cost , shorten time IV placement ( reduce needlesticks ) , less discomfort , decrease complication compare standard IV therapy moderate severely dehydrated patient rural Kenya . Research question This study seek help answer follow research question : Can hSC effectively introduce among mid-level provider rural community hospital western Kenya ? Can hSC serve effective safe treatment bridge IV access among patient present moderate-to-severe dehydration ? What perceptions attitude provider patient upon use hSC ? What cost effectiveness hSC set ? Objectives To evaluate efficacy hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous resuscitation ( hSC ) moderate severely dehydrated patient Kenya .</detailed_description>
