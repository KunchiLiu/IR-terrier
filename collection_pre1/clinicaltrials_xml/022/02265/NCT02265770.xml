	<brief_summary>The overall aim project improve outcome patient diagnose ependymoma improve harmonise stag standard care patient population improve investigator understand underlie biology thereby informing future treatment . The program evaluate new strategy diagnosis ( centralized review pathology image ) new therapeutic strategy order develop treatment recommendation . Patients stratify different treatment subgroup accord age , tumour location outcome initial surgery . Each subgroup study specific randomise study evaluate propose therapeutic strategy . Stratum 1 : The aim stratum 1 evaluate clinical impact 16-week chemotherapy regimen VEC-CDDP follow surgical resection conformal radiotherapy term progression free survival patient &gt; 12 month &lt; 22 year diagnosis , completely remove intra cranial Ependymoma . Stratum 2 : This stratum design phase II trial patient &gt; 12 month &lt; 22 year diagnosis , residual disease investigate possible activity HD-MTX give patient benefit VEC chemotherapy whilst randomise half patient receive additional HD-MTX . Patients receive conformal radiotherapy ( cRT ) . For patient remain residual inoperable disease induction chemotherapy cRT , 8 Gy boost radiotherapy residual tumour deliver immediately end cRT . Stratum 3 This stratum design phase II trial evaluate benefit postoperative dose intense chemotherapy administer alone combination valproate child &lt; 12 month age eligible receive radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An International Clinical Program Diagnosis Treatment Children With Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ependymoma Program comprehensive program improve accuracy primary diagnosis ependymoma explore different therapeutic strategy child , adolescent young adult , accordingly . This program open patient diagnosed ependymoma age 22 year . It include centralised review pre post-operative imaging ass completeness resection . It also include central review pathology confirm histological diagnosis . The biological marker 1q gain , Tenascin C status , NELL2 LAMA2 , RELA-fusion molecular subgroup methylation array prospectively assess prospective evaluation disease subgroup . Further biological evaluation coordinate within link BIOMECA study . After surgery central review image pathology , patient offer opportunity undergo second look surgery , possible . Patients enrol one 3 different stratum accord outcome initial surgical resection ( residual disease v residual disease ) , age eligibility / suitability receive radiotherapy . These 3 different stratum correspond 3 therapeutic strategy accord patient status . 1 . Stratum 1 design randomised phase III study patient complete resection , measurable residual disease ( confirm centrally review MRI ) &gt; 12 month &lt; 22 year diagnosis . Those patient randomise receive conformal radiotherapy follow either 16 week chemotherapy VEC-CDDP , observation . 2 . Stratum 2 design randomised phase II study patient inoperable measurable residual disease &gt; 12 month &lt; 22 year diagnosis . Those patient randomise two different treatment schedule chemotherapy either VEC VEC+ high dose methotrexate ( VEC +HD-MTX ) . After completion frontline chemotherapy , patient assess response ( MRI ) receive second look surgery feasible . For patient remain unresectable residual disease despite frontline chemotherapy second line surgery feasible , study safety radiotherapy boost 8 Gy administer residual tumour immediately completion conformal radiotherapy . Patients without evidence residual disease chemotherapy and/or second look surgery eligible radiotherapy boost . All patient show progression chemotherapy receive , maintenance therapy , 16 week course VEC -CDDP follow completion radiotherapy . 3 . Stratum 3 design randomised phase II chemotherapy study child &lt; 12 month age eligible receive radiotherapy . These patient randomise receive dose dense chemotherapy alternate myelosuppressive relatively non-myelosuppressive drug 2 weekly interval , without , addition histone deacetylase inhibitor , valproate . Registry : Patients fulfil inclusion criterion one interventional stratum enrol follow via observational study analyse descriptively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>After Initial surgery , patient enrol one 3 different interventional stratum offer set therapeutic intervention base outcome intervention ( measurable residue v residual inoperable disease ) , age and/or eligibility /suitability receive radiotherapy . Patients centrally histologically confirm intracranial ependymoma meeting follow criterion enrol one interventional stratum : Age &lt; 22 year old diagnosis Newly diagnose ependymoma WHO grade II III , include ependymoma variant : cellular , papillary , clearcell tanycytic anaplastic ependymoma Postmenarchal female pregnant nursing ( breast feeding ) negative betaHCG pregnancy test prior commence trial Males females reproductive age childbearing potential effective contraception duration treatment 6 month completion treatment No contraindication use one study drug propose protocol Patients and/or parent legal guardian willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure Common inclusion criterion Strata 1 2 : Age &gt; 12 month &lt; 22 year time study entry Histologically confirm WHO Grade IIIII ependymoma central pathological review No metastasis spinal MRI CSF cytology assessments No previous radiotherapy No previous chemotherapy ( except steroid ) No coexistent unrelated disease time study entry would render patient unable receive chemotherapy No medical contraindication radiotherapy chemotherapy No sign infection Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function Specific inclusion criterion Stratum 1 : • No residual measurable ependymoma base central neuroradiological review ( R012 ) Specific inclusion criterion Stratum 2 : • Residual non reoperable measurable ependymoma base central neuroradiological review ( R34 ) Inclusion criterion Stratum 3 : Children young 12 month time entry study child ineligible receive radiotherapy due age diagnosis , tumour location clinician / parent decision accord national criterion Histologically confirm WHO Grade IIIII ependymoma central pathological review Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function No previous chemotherapy radiotherapy No contraindication chemotherapy . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion one interventional stratum enrol follow observational study descriptive analysis perform . EXCLUSION CRITERIA interventional stratum : Tumour entity primary intracranial ependymoma Primary diagnosis predate open SIOP Ependymoma II Patients WHO grade I ependymoma include ependymoma variant : myxopapillary ependymomas subependymomas , patient spinal cord location primary tumour Participation within different trial treatment ependymoma Age ≥ 22 year Contraindication one IMP use accord SmPCs Concurrent treatment antitumour agent Inability tolerate chemotherapy Unable tolerate intravenous hydration Preexisting mucositis , peptic ulcer , inflammatory bowel disease ascites , pleural effusion Pregnancy breast feeding Strata 1 2 : Ineligible receive radiotherapy Patient imaging remain RX despite effort clarify MRI conclusion Stratum 3 : Preexisting severe hepatic and/or renal damage Family history severe epilepsy Presence previously undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder detect screen part trial Elevated blood ammonium lactate level ≥ 1.5 x upper limit normal</criteria>
