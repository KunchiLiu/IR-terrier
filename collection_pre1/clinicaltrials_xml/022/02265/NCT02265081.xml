	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate specific factor pelvic floor functional anatomy predict ability vaginal birth caesarean section . Physical characteristic soft tissue female pelvis play important role successful vaginal delivery . A `` tight '' less distensible pelvic floor muscle may influence mode delivery , lead poor labour progression compress foetal head produce CTG abnormality deceleration , result caesarean delivery . One main structure pelvic floor , puborectoalis muscle , facilitate passage fetal head birth canal stretch distending . Therefore distensibility female pelvic floor influence mode delivery . Three hundred patient , third trimester pregnancy , recruit via antenatal clinic minimize disruption pregnancy care provision . Eligible participant pregnant woman either one vaginal birth , one caesarean section give inform consent maintain autonomy regard mode delivery understand forthcoming study result . Participants exclude sustain obstetric complication may impede time mode delivery include emergency prelabour caesarean section . Ultrasonographic assessment difference pelvic characteristic woman use predict successful trial vaginal delivery caesarean section ( VBAC ) subsequent pregnancy . The result use well inform whether simple ( single ultrasound assessment ) use help inform woman 's choice regard mode delivery . Results research could pioneer blueprint study , little known topic .</brief_summary>
