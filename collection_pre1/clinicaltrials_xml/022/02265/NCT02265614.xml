	<brief_title>PGS Using Microarray IVF Patients With Repeated Implantation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) important method remedy infertility , whether cause male female , cause unknown . Treatment usually involve transfer uterus fertilize egg ( embryo ) culture 2-5 day . To select embryo best chance successful implantation endometrium , microscopic evaluation currently use grade embryonic cell division , cellular appearance , factor . But method incomplete determine functional property embryo , whether genetically normal . It known couple history multiple unsuccessful IVF treatment produce large number embryo abnormal number chromosome ( aneuploidy ) , also common woman age 38 . This project intend use preimplantation genetic screening ( PGS ) microarray technique determine chromosome composition fertilize egg , chromosomally normal embryo transfer IVF . The purpose increase probability pregnancy childbirth among couple history repeat unsuccessful IVF attempt . We previously conduct prospective randomize study similar question ( Ã– 612-02 ) target group old woman ( &gt; 38 year ) use sample ( biopsy ) embryo day 3 culture , follow analysis seven chromosome pair use FISH technique . The result study show improvement pregnancy outcome . The reason probably 1 ) begin , normal egg infrequent target group ; 2 ) biopsy perform day 3 embryo sensitive stage ; 3 ) 7 total 23 chromosome pair could analyze . Methodological development field rapid , current technology allow good identification normal embryo compare previous study . - We know embryo less sensitive biopsy carry day 5 ( blastocyst stage ) instead day 3 . - In blastocyst biopsy , cell remove diagnosis day 3 biopsy ( thereby increase reliability analysis ) . - Blastocyst biopsy involve removal few cell percentage basis ( 3-5 % ) total cell mass blastocyst compare previously use day 3 biopsy , involve removal 25 % total number cell . - Blastocysts high implantation rate day 3 embryo . - Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( aCGH ) use great precision analyze chromosome use commercial quality-controlled kit . - Cryopreservation vitrification blastocyst currently highly successful technique allow analysis conduct without pressed time . In addition , turn patient group consist woman proven normal-good ovarian reserve . In previous study involve woman &gt; 38 year , ovarian reserve generally poor . The preparatory work Genetic Integrity Act state PGS `` reserve clearly define research project approve ethical review ethic committee . '' This restriction impose state knowledge PGS time limit . More experience research project PGS consider necessary determine whether PGS could use clinical practice . The mentioned preparatory work Genetic Integrity Act also state PGS `` may become important tool increase chance pregnancy conjunction IVF treatment ... '' . In project , intend investigate whether possible increase chance pregnancy childbirth among couple undergone several previous fail IVF attempt . Our hypothesis base assumption incorrect number chromosome often underlie cause fail implantation miscarriage . To increase chance establish pregnancy lead childbirth , conduct chromosome analysis embryo couple ensure embryo normal chromosome set transfer woman . Question Can probability pregnancy childbirth couple several previous fail IVF attempt increase normal chromosome set ensured embryo transfer ? As control , compare result IVF attempt light microscopic evaluation perform . Primary endpoint : Delivery per randomize patient Secondary endpoint : Cumulative pregnancy rate include later transfer remain vitrified blastocyst ( high rate expect study group ) . Miscarriage rate first 18 week pregnancy ( low rate expect study group ) . Methods material Patients Couples history least three unsuccessful IVF attempt , woman maximum 39 year age , invite conjunction consultation new IVF treatment IVF Sweden clinic participate study , provide meet inclusion criterion ( include expect normal response hormone stimulation 8-10 egg ) . The woman agree participate study randomize ( computer ) either biopsy control group day collection oocytes least 5 fertilize egg ( current procedure culture day 5 ) . Inclusion criterion : Couples meet criterion IVF treatment history least three previous IVF cycle include embryo transfer without delivery . The woman may maximum 39 year old study carry must normal-good ovarian reserve ( least 12 antral follicle ) . Her partner must able provide semen sample contain live sperm . Women include study participate research project . Exclusion criterion : Myoma , uterine lesion judge affect implantation . Nonspecific cysts consider functional . Endometrium &gt; 3 cm . Randomization Randomization take place day 1 couple meet requirement establish culture blastocyst stage ( least 5 normally fertilize oocyte ) . The on-line randomization program ( computerize ) balance follow parameter : - Age - Number oocytes retrieve Furthermore time randomization , randomization program take account multicenter study involve avoid bias . IVF treatment Hormone stimulation , ultrasound check , collection oocyte , fertilization follow standard procedure . For woman control group , expand blastocyst cryopreserved ( vitrified ) day 5-6 later transfer . For woman randomize PGS , cell ( trophectoderm cell outer cell layer embryo ) biopsied day 5-6 biopsied blastocyst vitrify . If analysis show normal chromosome set , blastocyst thaw transfer next menstrual cycle . Biopsy cell lysis The biopsy carry make hole shell blastocyst ( zona pellucida ) use laser technology special biopsy equipment remove 2-5 cell outer cell mass ( trophoblast cell ) . The cell transfer test tube contain PBS solution . An extraction solution add lyse cell , DNA release solution . Optimization genome amplification To optimize protocol cell lysis whole genome amplification , cell embryonic stem cell line trisomy 13 well normal karyotype use . Three , four five cell respectively pipetted PCR tube . The entire aCGH protocol ( see ) run cell ( least 50 tube ) , result evaluate . This approach provide u idea sensitivity method often fail obtain result due unsuccessful amplification . Contamination system , , also reveal . Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( aCGH ) Reagent amplification ( copy ) DNA add DNA extract . Amplification carry several step use technique call `` Polymerase Chain Reaction '' ( PCR ) . This process require great accuracy special laboratory facility foreign DNA contaminate sample . Contamination step could lead misdiagnosis chromosome constitution embryo . The amplified DNA label fluorescent molecule cause DNA fluoresce green UV illumination . Similarly , normal control DNA label molecule fluoresces red UV illumination . Amplified fluorescently label DNA mixed equal volume normal fluorescently label control DNA . This DNA mixture apply test surface specific DNA sequence . These DNA sequence carefully select place test surface long arrays specific order , mean DNA chromosome arm represent test surface specific location . During hybridization step , DNA DNA mixture compete bind DNA test surface . If equal amount amplify DNA ( green ) control DNA ( red ) , equal amount DNA fraction bind test surface . After hybridization , test surface illuminate UV light , green red fluorescence equally intense , result orange color ( mixture equal portion red green color ) . However , excess DNA give chromosome embryo ( e.g. , trisomy ) , DNA sequence chromosome bind test surface , result excess green fluorescence area test surface contain DNA sequence relevant chromosome . Similarly , loss chromosome embryo result shortage correspond DNA amplified fraction , cause control DNA sequence ( red ) bind test surface . Test area scan result process automatically computerized scanner . Grading embryo : Evaluation grade blastocyst do accordance accept classification accord Gardner degree expansion , cell density , number cell inner cell mass ( IC ) trophectoderm ( TE ) assess . All blastocyst control group vitrify later transfer . A similar evaluation carry biopsy group prior biopsy . Following biopsy , biopsied blastocyst vitrify . In group biopsy conduct , microarray analysis carry . Transfer do natural menstrual cycle 5 day ovulation . Women hormonal disruption require mild hormonal stimulation prior transfer vitrified/warmed blastocyst . Vitrification After blastocyst biopsied , vitrify subsequently thaw accord well establish protocol clinic . Follow-up The primary endpoint birth per randomize patient . Secondary endpoint cumulative pregnancy rate , since extra cryopreserved blastocyst ( ) also transfer , miscarriage rate first 18 week pregnancy ( low rate expect study group ) . We plan create Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) consist independent external expert half study complete . Follow pregnancy childbirth carry accord current procedure within IVF . Statistics Power analysis show detect significant difference pregnancy outcomes estimate 15 % control group 40 % PGS group require 112 patient ( alpha=0.8 ; Beta=0.20 ) . An estimated attrition rate 10 % plan DSMB analysis mean 130 patient recruit . The DSMB monitor study provide periodic advice whether continue study . The DSMB analysis give 3 recommendation : ( 1 ) continue study plan , ( 2 ) stop study difference group less 15 % , ( 3 ) continue study large sample size . When difference group 20 % great study continue large sample size ( 73 patient group The DSMB analysis advice continue stop study ( due highly significant effect , negative effect low conditional power . DSMB evaluate live birth ongoing pregnancy weigh information give recommendation . The DSMB consist specialist experience field . Statistical calculation carry accord intention-to-treat ( ITT ) , well per protocol . ITT randomize patient , least 5 fertilized oocyte day 1 . Some patient likely transfer due lack blastocyst , technical problem relate vitrification/warming etc . Therefore , analysis also do per protocol . Logistic regression use statistical calculation include stratification variable .</detailed_description>
