	<brief_summary>The research lead consortium result receive funding European Union Seventh Framework Programme [ FP7/2007-2013 ] grant agreement 602461 ( www.biocog.eu ) . The investigator establish valid biomarkers panel ( neuroimaging molecular ) risk clinical outcome prediction postoperative delirium ( POD ) /postoperative cognitive deficit ( POCD ) N = 1200 elective surgical patient ( Age ≥ 65 year ) study center Berlin , Germany ( data collection within 5 year initial hospital stay ) Utrecht , The Netherlands ( data collection within 1 year initial hospital stay ) , thereof cerebrospinal fluid ( day surgery patient plan spinal anesthesia/combined spinal epidural analgesia N = 200 patient , Berlin ) . Post-mortem sample brain tissue analyze limited number voluntary patient , Berlin . A control group 300 ASA II/III- patient ( 200 Berlin surround area 100 Utrecht surround area ) collect measure learn experience cognitive testing . The participant match age , education , gender study patient . The 300 ASA II/III- patient Berlin surround area Utrecht surround area receive additionally MRI-scan ( 3 Tesla ) baseline , 3 month 1 year . An interim-analysis perform primary endpoint 400 include patient . The result ( multivariate ) expert system expect : 1 ) support clinical decision-making patient care , e.g . balance individual POD/POCD risk expect overall clinical outcome ( elective ) surgical intervention , 2 ) allow design sophisticated hypothesis-driven clinical study drug trial ( translational research ) future . The latter possible basis biomarker-based sub-grouping patient well understand relevant pathophysiological process . Furthermore , state-of-the art clinical database biobank create yet exist worldwide . Both expert system reference database/biobank expand leadership contribute academic institution particular research area . In addition , newly create biobank become integral part European Biobanking Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure ( BBMRI ) allow top address specific hypothesis-driven research question . Most notably , develop ( multivariate ) expert system also potential commercialization . Possible customer : 1 ) physician hospital department involve pre-surgical decision making , 2 ) pharmaceutical industry intend conduct biomarker-based drug trial POD/POCD .</brief_summary>
