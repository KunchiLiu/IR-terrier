	<detailed_description>Effective treatment speech disorder IPD important optimal control limb motor symptom . Presently , Lee Silverman Voice Treatment ( LSVTÃ’ LOUD ) - time intensive behavioral treatment Parkinson 's hypophonia . Facilitatory TMS safe complimentary stimulation technique . Brain imaging also identify suitable target brain region readily accessible TMS . This combined treatment modality approach effective efficient LSVT alone . The study enroll patient Parkinson 's disease moderate severe hypophonia . A total 36 patient recruit 3 year divide 3 group ( n=12 ) . The three cohort : 1 . LSVT +sham TMS ; 2 . LSVT +left rTMS 3 . LSVT + right rTMS . This longitudinal double blind randomize controlled clinical trial . All investigator study personnel blind study except PI responsible TMS ( Dr. Narayana ) . The entire protocol occur 19 week . During first week , participant screen , consent . During second week , baseline behavioral imaging data collect . Next , patient randomize one three treatment group . Then patient enter 4-week treatment phase , receive TMS/sham TMS LSVT 4 day week 4 week . During seventh week , patient undergo post treatment behavioral imaging assessment . Then patient return week 19 complete follow behavioral measure image session .</detailed_description>
