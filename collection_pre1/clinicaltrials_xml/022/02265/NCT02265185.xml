	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity major area concern health care public health . Overweight child likely overweight obese adult . Chronic health problem associate adult obesity occur frequently child . Because associated health problem potential long term struggle obesity , intervention early life essential address obesity epidemic . Some intervention work area focus pediatric primary care set order utilize influence credibility medical provider . Unfortunately , primary care visit often short spend significant amount time issue diet , weight nutrition . There little work explore potential alternative care setting , pediatric Emergency Department ( ED ) address childhood obesity . While provider time also limit ED , often considerable amount downtime emergency department visit could valuable time patient parent education . There may also opportunity reach parent child ED regularly utilize primary care . In order explore possibility pediatric obesity intervention Children 's Pediatric Emergency Department , need measure prevalence obesity population utilize Children 's ED . The height patient see ED routinely measure , make calculate BMI determine obesity impossible . This study , establish prevalence obesity Children 's Emergency Department lay groundwork future work address obesity ED .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/Significance Childhood obesity well-documented public health crisis . Data recent National Health Nutrition Examination survey ( NHANES ) indicate prevalence obesity 8.4 % 2 5-year-olds , 17.7 % 6 11-year-olds , 20.5 % 12 19-year-olds ( 1 ) . Large racial/ethnic disparity risk obesity already present preschool year ( 2 ) . In 2 5-year-olds , 3.5 % non-Hispanic white child obese , compare 11.3 % non-Hispanic black 16.7 % Hispanic child ( 1 ) . Many health problem previously associate adult obesity see youth , include metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular abnormality ( 3 ) . Obesity track adulthood , highlight need early intervention ( 4 ) . Overweight child chronic condition , great risk emergency department visit , significantly high cost common pediatric hospitalization ( 5-7 ) . Successfully address childhood obesity epidemic require coordinate collective effort across many setting include multiple healthcare setting ( 8 ) . Obesity intervention increasingly develop utilize influential role credibility pediatric primary care provider integrate intervention healthcare setting ( 9 ) . Unfortunately , primary care visit often short ( average primary visit 16.4 minute ) leave little time address obesity detail , highlight need also incorporate assessment treatment alternative care setting ( i.e. , emergency care ) ( 10 , 11 ) . There little research role alternative healthcare setting could play address childhood obesity . The pediatric ED currently untapped set obesity screening , treatment prevention ( 12 ) . Yet , childhood obesity important implication emergency medicine trauma care , pediatric ED may shoulder disproportionate burden disease compare healthcare setting ( 13 , 14 ) . Not address patient 's obesity ED setting miss opportunity , especially many visit obesity- related ( e.g. , asthma , type 2 diabetes , fracture ) , weight reduction specific subgroup could lead decrease future ED utilization . The pediatric ED may seem like ideal location address childhood obesity many visit non-emergent/urgent condition type visit provide window screen intervention ( 12,15 ) . Families spend substantial amount time ED wait laboratory/radiology result disposition . In 2013 , average length stay Children 's EDs 155 minute Minneapolis 143 minute St. Paul , valuable time could use obesity screening , education , connection external resource . The pediatric ED potential important additional healthcare set obesity screening , education , linkage external resource , much research need ( 12,13,16 ) . Three previous study examine obesity rate pediatric ED , find high prevalence obesity compare general population ( 12,13,16 ) . Prendergast et al . conduct retrospective chart review find prevalence obesity 29 % Chicago pediatric ED , nearly double national average 17 % ( 12 ) . The two study collect cross-sectional data small sample urban pediatric EDs find prevalence obesity 24 % ( 13 ) 21.6 % ( 16 ) . Only one study test obesity screen pediatric ED ( 16 ) . Vaughn et al . find parent receptive obesity screen prevention ED , regardless race ( 16 ) . They also find 7.6 % parent report child 's regular physician counsel regard child 's weight , highlight need obesity screen additional healthcare setting ( 16 ) . These study indicate pediatric EDs see population patient high risk obesity , many may receive screen counsel regular physician . Other topic emergency medicine receive far great coverage literature , include smoke cessation , injury prevention substance abuse ( 13 ) . With dramatic increase pediatric obesity , research obesity pediatric ED especially warrant innovative strategy collaboration across healthcare setting need successfully address epidemic . Currently , prevalence obesity patient utilize pediatric ED Children 's Hospitals Clinics Minnesota unknown . Because time constraint , height patient see pediatric ED routinely measure record Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) . Establishing prevalence obesity population possible without measure height PED patient determine BMI . Establishing prevalence population patient utilize pediatric ED lay groundwork future grant proposal research area . Research Questions : 1 . What prevalence obesity Children 's ED patient population ? 2 . What association weight status ED utilization injury , asthma mental health ? Study Design We conduct cross-sectional cohort study patient age 2-10 Children 's ED . Methods ED research assistant screen ED log patient 2-10 age range triaged level 3-5 . Research assistant randomly determine 1 5 patient approach study enrollment . After consent process complete , research assistant measure record child 's height , ask parent complete short questionnaire .</detailed_description>
