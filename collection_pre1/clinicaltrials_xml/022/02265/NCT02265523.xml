	<brief_title>Exercise Cycle Ergometry Post TKA - A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit current wait list either Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre Big Thunder Orthopedics . The physician discussing study eligibility requirement potential participant . The research assistant Big Thunder obtain signed consent potential participant pre-operative appointment . If potential participant would like discus study research team well doctor give consent , research team contact . Adequate enrolment expect amount TKA perform previous year 300 . Eligibility screen perform physician surgeon 's office prior potential participant give informed consent . The physician make decision whether someone eligible base examination medical history . If potential participant ineligible base information , involve study . During consultation , physician familiarize potential participant study , consent form , relevant study material . The physician answer question potential participant study ask would rather speak member research team . The potential participant give opportunity discus study investigator Research Ethics Board prior sign consent form . If participant wish consent study speak research assistant Big Thunder pre-operative appointment obtain signed consent form . The participant give copy sign consent form information letter record . The original form temporarily store locked cabinet Big Thunder , pick weekly retain Dr. Paolo Sanzo lock office . The two study group standard post-operative exercise protocol exercise protocol combine use Viscus V1.5 kinetic flywheel ergometer . The standard post-operative exercise already currently recommend patient . Briefly , include deep breathing coughing , ankle pumping , buttock contraction , static quadriceps strengthen . The use kinetic flywheel ergometer allow pedal revolution track well time use . Participants randomize Viscus group access Viscus V1.5 24 hour per day recovery room use leisure . All participant track exercise exercise log use observe compliance . The participant 's intensity exercise rat 5-point Likert scale treat physiotherapist/nurse use Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale ( SIRAS ) . The intensity exercise rat minimum effort maximum effort ; frequency exercise participant ability follow instruction advice rat never always ; receptivity change program rat unreceptive receptive . Prior surgery , demographic information height , weight , age gender , well medical history surgical history knee record . Pain Functional Measurements : The following measure take pre-operatively ( day surgery pre surgery clinic ) , day 2 post-operatively , upon discharge , 12 week post-operatively : Knee pain measure use visual analog scale ( VAS ) . The VAS test-retest reliability .71-.99 , minimal clinically important difference ±28 mm . Functional status measure use Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . The WOMAC internal consistency .96 ; test-retest reliability .64-.93 ; sensitive change time . Knee swell measure via girth measure take 15 cm superior superior pole patella ; supra infrapatellar region ; 15 cm inferior inferior pole patella . Knee flexion extension ROM measure use goniometer . Resisted isometric knee flexion extension strength measure subject lie supine knee position rest position ( 25° flexion ) . The mean three trial record pound use Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester model 01165 . Motivation measure use Behavioural Regulation Exercise Questionnaire ( BREQ2 ) pre- post-operatively . This questionnaire give participant physiotherapist take measure VAS , WOMAC , girth strength . This questionnaire create David Markland Vannessa Tobin 2004 . Adverse event DVT , PE , wound infection record . Blood marker : Blood collect nurse trained phlebotomy pre-operatively , 2 day post-operatively , upon discharge . From whole blood sample , sample prepare plasma ( von Willebrand factor ) serum ( remain biomarkers , list section ) follow manufacturer 's instruction . Plasma serum isolate whole blood , aliquoted , store -80 degree celsius analysis use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit . Plasma serum assay perform Dr. Lees ' lab NOSM . Panel Biomarkers : The panel biomarkers design screen follow 3 category : Inflammation-The inflammatory marker select base potential identify early infection complication ( procalcitonin , IL-6 ) . Recent research establish procalcitonin highly specific rapid diagnostic marker infection give false positive value follow surgical joint replacement . In addition , IL-6 link risk thrombogenic event complication recovery ( fever , increase pain decrease ROM ) . Nutrition- It estimate 50-82 % patient hospital undernourish link sub-optimal immune competence . The nutritional status biomarkers select base ability identify protein ( prealbumin/transthyretin ) vitamin D status . The scientific literature relate vitamin D bone health older adult extensive . It establish protein malnutrition associate impaired immune function . More recently vitamin D deficiency also show result impair immune function . Impaired immune function manifest post-operative infection and/or unsatisfactory rehabilitation . In addition , patient deficient protein vitamin D know risk increase disability follow THA TKA increase infection . Thrombogenesis Risk- Deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) without pulmonary embolism ( PE ) potentially life threaten complication TKA surgery . Plasma von Willebrand factor predict thromboembolic event . In addition , P-selectin emerge promise biomarker VT high circulating level P-selectin establish valuable predictor VTE cancer patient . Warfarin aspirin therapy effect either plasma von Willebrand factor soluble P-selectin . During consent process throughout study , participant potential participant difficulty understand English language , effort make provide translation . The physiotherapist obtain range motion , strength , girth measure , administer VAS , WOMAC BREQ2 . This occur participant hospital . The physiotherapist nurse rate participant 's intensity exercise base review exercise log book . A nurse trained phlebotomy draw blood sample hospital research assistant transport back NOSM aliquoted label participant code , store -80 degree celsius analysis . Compiled measurement date measurement take record data abstraction form physiotherapist nurse take measurement . The research team ( Principal Investigator , Co-Investigators research assistant ) access data . The research assistant code data order ensure confidentiality keep case samples/data leave hospital setting . Any non cod data store hospital secure filing cabinet lock office . Computer data kept secure server password protect computer . A nurse trained phlebotomy collect blood sample . The research assistant , obtain Transportation Dangerous Goods certificate , transport sample hospital NOSM storage analysis . For whole blood sample , sample prepare PT aPTT follow manufacturer 's instruction . For serum biomarkers , serum isolated whole blood 1.5 hour post draw , aliquoted , store -80 degree celsius analysis use ELISA kit . All sample label participant code number well letter time point . For example , A pre-surgery , B 2 day surgery , C upon doscharge . Samples keep analysis complete , label remove sample dispose biohazardous waste . Dr. Lees research assistant perform data analysis use ELISA kit blood sample NOSM . Dr. Lees perform statistical analysis portion NOSM . Dr. Sanzo complete data analysis clinical functional measurement TBRHSC/SJCG . Missing data handle accord type data miss . For example , day miss Viscus usage , fill due fact total usage collect . We still total distance include day record . If blood sample collect , depend type analysis . For analysis depend change ( pre- versus post- ) , exclude participant . However , remain blood sample participant could still use certain analysis ( e.g. , compare group mean data final day Viscus versus control ) . In addition , would still able include functional motivation data . There interim analysis . The target sample size 100 participant total , 50 group . With group size , power analysis perform ROM measure ( high variability small change ) 10 % potential change +/- 15 % give power 0.928 . To achieve power 0.8 , minimum group size 35 participant . Repeated measure perform individual improvement pre-operative post-operative measure . For measure independent individual improvement , ANOVA use . A Fisher 's LSD post hoc use complete analysis . Along quantitative method , order measure compliance , participant 's intensity exercise rat 5-point Likert scale treat physiotherapist/nurse use Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale ( SIRAS ) . The intensity exercise rat minimum effort maximum effort ; frequency exercise participant ability follow instruction advice rat never always ; receptivity change program rat unreceptive receptive . Compliance take account order identify participant may require additional monitoring improve rehabilitative success .</detailed_description>
