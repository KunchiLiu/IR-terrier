	<brief_title>Developing Smokers Smoker ( S4S ) : A Collective Intelligence Tailoring System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking still number one preventable cause cancer death . New approach need engage smoker 21st century smoking cessation . I propose develop S4S ( Smokers Smoker ) , next-generation patient-centered computer tailor health communication ( CTHC ) system . Unlike current rule-based CTHCs , S4S replace rule complex machine learn algorithm , use collective experience thousand smoker engage web-assisted tobacco intervention enhance personally-relevant tailor new smoker enter system . The investigator adapt collective intelligence algorithm use outside healthcare company like Amazon Google enhance CTHC . Using knowledge scientific expert , current CTHC collect baseline patient `` profile '' use expert-written , rule-based system tailor message patient subset . Such theory-based `` market segmentation effective help patient reach lifestyle goal . However , natural limit ability rule-based system truly personalize content , adapt personalization time . Current CTHC reach limit , investigator propose go beyond . The investigator first aim develop Web 2.0 `` S4S '' recommender system . The investigator second aim evaluate S4S within context NCI fund web-assisted tobacco intervention ( Decide2Quit.org ) .</detailed_description>
