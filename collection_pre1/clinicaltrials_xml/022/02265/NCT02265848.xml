	<brief_title>High Frequency Stimulation Trials Patients With Precision Spinal Cord Stimulator System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject Precision model spinal cord stimulators invite take part study compare high frequency stimulation versus low frequency stimulation look change efficacy , preferability high low frequency stimulation program spinal cord stimulator ( SCS ) system . The study design 7 week study take 9 week per subject . 7 week divide 3 segment . First segment 3 week spinal cord stimulation follow second segment wash period , take 1 week ( 7 day ) , last segment 3 week spinal cord stimulation . At end segment , follow visit . Each follow visit occur 5 business day follow due date post spinal cord stimulation follow ups , 3 business day follow due date post wash visit . At visit , include baseline , subject ask answer Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , Patients Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) ass interval effect program parameter spinal cord stimulator . Visit schedule assessment summary : Visit 1 : Screening Baseline - Review inclusion exclusionary criterion ( I &amp; E ) - Informed Consent - Demographics , Medical History - Physical examination , Vital sign . - Randomization ( A , B ) programming device accord randomization - Baseline questionnaires - Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) measure pain experience subject 1 week prior enrol study . include best pain , bad pain , average pain well pain time enrollment . - Oswestry disability index ( ODI ) measure average disability cause painful condition approximately 3 week prior enrollment study . Subject ask 10 different category activity daily live . They : pain intensity , personal care , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep , sex life , social life , travel . - Patients Global Impression Change ( PGI-C ) ask assess subject 's impression painful condition , since implant spinal cord stimulator . - Concomitant medication Visit 2 : ( end 3 week assessment , + 5 day ) End first treatment period - Interim Questionnaires : - NPRS : We measure pain experienced subject 3 week since last research visit ( visit 1 ) , prior visit 2 . This include best pain , bad pain , average pain well pain time enrollment . - Oswestry disability index measure disability cause painful condition since last visit study ( visit 1 ) , cover 3 week duration last research visit . Subject ask 10 different category activity daily live . They : pain intensity , personal care , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep , sex life , social life , travel . - PGI-C asked ass subject 's impression painful condition , since last visit study ( visit 1 ) , cover 3 week duration since last research visit , prior visit 2 . - Device Interrogation turn SCS 7 10 day - Start wash period 7 10 day - Review Adverse Events ( AE ) Concomitant medication ( Con med ) Visit 3 : ( end wash period , +3 day ) Beginning second treatment period - Questionnaires : - NPRS measure pain experience subject 1 week since visit 2 , prior visit 3 , include best pain , bad pain , average pain well pain time enrollment . - Oswestry disability index measure disability cause painful condition 1 week since last visit 2 , prior visit 3 . Subject ask 10 different category activity daily live . They : pain intensity , personal care , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep , sex life , social life , travel . - PGI-C asked ass subject 's impression painful condition , last 1 week since visit 2 , prior visit 3 . - Device interrogation programming ; start next treatment period . - Review AE Con med . Visit 4 : ( end 3 week assessment +5 day ) End Treatment - End second treatment period . - End treatment Questionnaires : - NPRS : We measure pain experienced subject 3 week since last research visit ( visit 3 ) prior visit 4 . This include best pain , bad pain , average pain well pain time enrollment . - Oswestry disability index measure disability cause painful condition since last visit study , cover 3 week duration last research visit ( visit 3 ) . Subject ask 10 different category activity daily live . They : pain intensity , personal care , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep , sex life , social life , travel . - PGI-C asked ass subject 's impression painful condition , since last visit study , cover 3 week duration since last research visit ( visit 3 ) , prior visit 4 . - Device Interrogation re-programming necessary . - Review AE 's Con med</detailed_description>
