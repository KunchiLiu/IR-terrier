	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Demonstrate Safety Efficacy OptiVein IV Catheter In Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OptiVein System use transillumination skin tissue aid cannulation consist OptiVein IV Catheter integrate optical fiber , electronic unit . The electronic unit portable internally power generator low power visible laser light green color . The electronic unit generate visible light , release tip needle soft tissue around tip IV catheter . Light visible skin help mark location tip needle skin vein . In addition pinpoint exact location tip needle , OptiVein System inform user exact moment penetration tip needle blood vessel . Hemoglobin blood strongly absorb visible light specific wavelength , needle enters blood vessel , light instantly absorb blood , cause instant fade skin transillumination . Instant disappearance tissue illumination indicate successful venipuncture . The user low angle needle start advance cannula needle blood vessel . Such optical confirmation much faster traditional observation blood flashback chamber needle lead increase first-attempt success rate decrease cannulation-related complication . The use OptiVein device compare use traditional IV catheter explore potential increase effectiveness cannulation OptiVein versus traditional IV catheter .</detailed_description>
