	<brief_summary>This study prospective , single center clinical trial ass corneal sensitivity nerve fiber morphology patient sleep apnea compare normal control . Healthy volunteer history ocular uncontrollable systemic disease encourage participate study . After execution review consent procedure , detailed history take slit lamp examination perform , verify ocular health . This consist examination eye include assessment ocular lid , lash , cornea conjunctival evaluation . Corneal touch threshold test Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer , standard non-invasive measure corneal sensitivity . Corneal nerve image use modify HRT vivo confocal microscope . The vivo confocal microscope allow high resolution image nerve plexus corneal epithelium . This corneal nerve plexus responsible corneal sensitively change loss establish early , sensitive indicator corneal neuropathy . The investigator anticipate study require approximately 30 patient group last approximately 12 month recruitment completion subject visit phase . There one clinical visit design project , unscheduled visit may schedule case adverse event . Patient recruitment complete one-year time point . At 14 month time point , data point collect assessment outcome measure ( corneal sensitivity sleep apnea patient versus control patient ) complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Assessment : Following execution inform consent , subject carefully screen ocular sign symptom , consistent protocol inclusion exclusion criterion . This include review ocular medical history include use concomitant &amp; ocular medication surgery perform past . Researchers also collect age , ethnicity , demographic , ophthalmic note eye exam history . Upon completion screen exam , subject deem eligible base study criterion test procedure perform investigator . Testing procedure : The visit include : Slit Lamp Microscopy : An ocular examination external ( lid , lash ) along internal ( cornea , lens , retina ) structure eye perform aid slit lamp . This instrument use lenses external light source refract different angle intensity assess ocular structure diagnostic purpose . Corneal sensitivity measurement : 1 . Corneal touch sensitivity determine use Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer mount standard slit lamp biomicroscope . The Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer routinely use clinical research purpose investigate corneal touch threshold . 2 . For sensitivity measurement , 0.12 mm diameter nylon thread slowly bring forward briefly touch cornea perpendicularly quickly withdrawn . 3 . On occasion , patient ask respond whenever stimulus felt . 4 . Thread length use quantitatively assess sensitivity . The long thread length use first ( 6 cm ) , provide low stimulus intensity . 5 . If subject unable detect touch stimulus , thread systematically shorten length 0.5 cm step stimulus felt . 6 . The criterion sensitivity threshold filament length give 50 % positive response four stimulus application . In Vivo Confocal Microscope 1 . Corneal nerve image use modify vivo confocal microscope routinely use clinic ( HRT Rostock corneal module , Heidelberg Engineering ) . 2 . The HRT In Vivo Confocal microscope modify add motor automate focus . This alter integrity , application , intent light source instrument . 3 . Corneas anesthetize topical anesthetic , proparacaine , prior scan . 4 . The confocal microscope briefly touch patient 's eye image save analysis .</detailed_description>
