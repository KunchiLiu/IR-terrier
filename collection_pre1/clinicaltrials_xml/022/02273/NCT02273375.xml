	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis primary nonsmall cell carcinoma lung . accord WHO Classification Tumours ( WHO Classification Tumours Lung , Pleura , Thymus Heart . WHO/IARC Classification Tumours , 4th Edition , Volume 7 ) . Patients largecell neuroendocrine carcinoma eligible . Patients must classify postoperatively Stage IB ( ≥ 4cm long diameter ) , II IIIA basis pathologic criterion . Note : Although T3N2M0 tumour reclassify stage IIIB 8th edition IASLC staging system , patient remain eligible ( stage IIIA 7th edition criterion ) . Complete surgical resection primary NSCLC also mandatory . All gross disease must remove end surgery . All surgical margin resection must negative tumour . Resection may accomplish open VATS technique Note : Patients synchronous primary tumour eligible due potential uncertainty regard appropriate PDL1 status . Prior Systemic Therapy : Preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) platinum base chemotherapy permissible . Patients may receive prior postoperative platinum base chemotherapy per standard care . No prior anticancer therapy treatment NSCLC standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy permissible . Radiation : • Preoperative postoperative plan radiation therapy permissible . The patient must ECOG performance status 0 , 1 . Hematology : . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ≥ 1,500/µl Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L ≥ 100,000/µl Biochemistry : Total bilirubin* ≤ institutional upper limit normal Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Creatinine Clearance ≥ 40 ml/min * exclude Gilbert 's syndrome Creatinine clearance measure directly 24 hour urine sampling calculate Cockcroft Formula : Females : GFR = 1.04 x ( 140age ) x weight kg serum creatinine μmol/L Males : GFR = 1.23 x ( 140age ) x weight kg serum creatinine μmol/L Patient able willing complete QoL , economics questionnaire . The baseline assessment must already complete within require timeline prior randomization . Inability ( illiteracy , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup Protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer , malignancy curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year follow end treatment , opinion treat physician , substantial risk recurrence prior malignancy . A combination small cell nonsmall cell lung cancer , pulmonary carcinoid tumour largecell neuroendocrine carcinoma ( LCNEC ) . History autoimmune disease , include limited myasthenia gravis , myositis , autoimmune hepatitis , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , vascular thrombosis associate antiphospholipid syndrome , Wegener 's granulomatosis , Sjögren 's syndrome , GuillainBarré syndrome , multiple sclerosis , vasculitis , glomerulonephritis . NOTE : patient Grave 's disease and/or psoriasis require systemic therapy within last two year randomization patient hypothyroidism ( e.g . follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement exclude . History primary immunodeficiency , history allogenic organ transplant require therapeutic immunosuppression use immunosuppressive agent within 28 day randomization* prior history severe ( grade 3 4 ) immune mediate toxicity immune therapy . Live attenuate vaccination administer within 30 day prior randomization . History hypersensitivity MEDI4736 excipient . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history , even control , must LVEF &gt; 50 % within 12 week prior randomization . Concurrent treatment investigational drug anticancer therapy . Patients active uncontrolled infection serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . This include limited : know clinical diagnosis tuberculosis ; know active hepatitis B infection ( positive HBV surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ) . Patients past resolve hepatitis B infection ( define presence hepatitis B core antibody ( antiHBc ) absence HBSAg ) eligible ; know active hepatitis C infection . Patients positive hepatitis C ( HCV ) antibody eligible polymerase chain reaction negative HCV RA ; know human immunodeficiency virus infection ( positive HIV antibody ) . know pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis clinically significant impairment pulmonary function Pregnant lactate woman . Women childbearing potential must urine pregnancy test proven negative within 14 day prior randomization . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception .</criteria>
