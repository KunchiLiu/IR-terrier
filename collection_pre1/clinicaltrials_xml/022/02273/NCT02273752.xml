	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well real-time pharmacokinetic therapeutic drug monitoring work prevent stomatitis develop patient hormone receptor positive breast cancer , pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , kidney cancer receive type cancer drug call everolimus . Stomatitis common side effect everolimus cause inflammation mouth , without oral ulcer , frequently lead patient discontinue medication . Monitoring blood level everolimus make adjustment patient 's dose may able decrease incidence stomatitis , maintain effectiveness everolimus treat cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine frequency grade stomatitis day 29 ( cycle 2 , day 1 ) patient receive dose-adjusted everolimus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . Progression-free survival rate 6 month . 2 . Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) -inhibition downstream mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) effectors peripheral blood . 3 . Number dose adjustment require . 4 . Percentage day therapy . 5 . Average minimum concentration ( Cmin ) value . 6 . Frequency type treatment stomatitis . 7 . Genetic predictor stomatitis development select outlier patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo real-time pharmacokinetic therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) day 4 , 8 , 15 course 1 . Dosing adjustment everolimus perform day 8 , necessary . If everolimus dose adjust , patient continue undergo real-time pharmacokinetic TDM weekly goal concentration achieve 2 consecutive measure . Patients whose everolimus dose adjust undergo real-time pharmacokinetic TDM day 1 course 2-6 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Confirmed diagnosis : Postmenopausal advance hormone receptorpositive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative breast cancer failure treatment letrozole anastrozole Progressive neuroendocrine tumor pancreatic origin ( PNET ) unresectable , locally advanced metastatic Advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) failure treatment sunitinib sorafenib Histologically confirm , measurable evaluable disease . Patients least one measurable lesion . Adequate bone marrow function indicate follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/μL Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL Adequate renal function , indicate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min Adequate liver function , indicate : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) International normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 2 Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2 x ULN unless related primary disease Signed informed consent Adequate birth control appropriate Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start everolimus ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc. , include somatostatin analogue , e.g. , octreotide ) Known intolerance hypersensitivity everolimus rapamycin analog ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus ) Known impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral everolimus Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition : Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction ≤ 6 month prior start everolimus , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III IV Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection , liver disease cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , active chronic hepatitis ( i.e . quantifiable hepatitis B virus [ HBV ] DNA and/or positive HbsAg , quantifiable hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] RNA ) Known severely impair lung function ( spirometry diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide [ DLCO ] 50 % less normal O2 saturation 88 % less rest room air ) Active , bleed diathesis Chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Known history HIV seropositivity Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start everolimus study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , Bacillus CalmetteGuérin ( BCG ) , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Patients history another primary malignancy , exception : nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , uterus , breast patient disease free ≥3 year Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable able complete entire study Patients currently part participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 1 month prior dose Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective method contraception study 8 week . Highly effective contraception method include combination two following : Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository Total abstinence Male/female sterilization Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior randomization . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider childbearing potential . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) WOCBP willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment</criteria>
