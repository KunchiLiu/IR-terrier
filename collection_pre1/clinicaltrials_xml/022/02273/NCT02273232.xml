The second group addition supervise exercise get ischemic preconditioning blood pressure cuff . The third group get ischemic precondition fourth group get standard exercise advice .

	<brief_title>Effects Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Moderate PVD Patients A Pilot Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) major health problem , affect approximately 20 % adult 55 year age 27 million people North America Europe . Most PVD asymptomatic . Intermittent claudication typical clinical manifestation , develop 5 % men age 60 year increase age . For every patient symptomatic PAD another three four subject general population PVD meet clinical criterion intermittent claudication [ 4 ] . There precise figure PVD 's health economic impact Ireland . In United States , estimate total cost PVD exceed $ 21 billion annually . Current treatment option non-lifestyle limiting claudication include watchful waiting , medical management , exercise training , endovascular treatment surgical reconstruction uncertainty regard optimal approach many patient . PVD patient usually multiple co-morbidities . Decisions regard optimal management seek balance risk intervention patient multiple co-morbidities , likely benefit term symptom relief quality life overall life-expectancy patient . There need safer , non-invasive intervention cost-effective acceptable patient . Ischemic precondition first describe Murry et al , almost 30 year ago observe protection confer ischemic myocardium precede brief period sub lethal ischemia separate period reperfusion . Subsequent experiment demonstrate brief period ischemia-reperfusion tissue confer protection tissue expose significant ischemic insult . For example , brief period skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion confers protection heart . This phenomenon refer remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) Clinical trial cardiac surgery percutaneous coronary intervention suggest RIPC reduces cardiac injury , critical care stay inotropes use . However , effect precondition peripheral vascular disease patient remain largely un evaluate , apart small study symptomatic relief exercise induce precondition effect . Remote precondition affect blood supply limb . Enko et al demonstrated intermittent arm ischemia apply 3 cycle 200mmHg pressure 5 minute , follow 5 minute reperfusion produce dilatation contralateral brachial artery healthy individual . In recent study , Karakyoun et al evaluate RIPC direct precondition rat model critical limb ischemia . Iliac artery ligation use create critical limb ischemia rat . Both direct preconditioning ( intermittent tourniquet application ischemic limb ) RIPC ( intermittent tourniquet application contralateral leg ) produce significant increase perfusion microvasculature density ischemic limb true new blood vessel formation direct IC RIPC group . The investigator hypothesize remote precondition adjunct exercise therapy alone could stimulate great microvessel formation legs claudication patient , improve clinical outcome term symptom delay complication . It may provide new non-invasive option PVD patient . Sampling Frame All peripheral vascular disease patient refer UCHG ( University Collage Hospital Galway ) OPD ( Out Patients ) addition inpatient trial period actively search identify medical profile fulfill trial criterion . Recruitment trial stop 15 month 24 month ' time frame . Trial Design Patients refer vascular service OPDs ( patient ) claudication symptom first time usually assess consultant specialty registrar . Further investigation course management depend mainly symptoms co morbidity . Many end diagnosis peripheral vascular disease . From group addition patient group moderate peripheral vascular disease i.e. , Rutherford stage 2 Fontaine stage 2a . Will recruit The target number 40 patient divide 4 group . All group candidate undergo base line assessment include history , examination , MRA ABIs . The candidate randomize : Supervised Exercise Group : All PVD patient get standard advice regard exercise group construct exercise program supervision Dr. Miche√°l Newell qualify Sports Exercise Scientist Doctorate degree Integrated Biology . This include six minute walk test , Chair Stand Test symptom free distance . RIPC supervise Exercise Group : This group structure intermittent period induce remote ischemic preconditioning use standard blood pressure cuff . The cuff apply 5 minute alternatively 5 minute rest total 4 cycle , need 40 minute per day . The RIPC group receive exercise program identical first group . The total number day participant 30 day . RIPC Standard Care Group : The patient group receive standard care advice regard exercise addition RIPC 2nd group . Control Group ( Standard Care ) : This group get standard advice regard exercise PVD patient information available OPD setting . Sample Size : The trial pilot study obtain preliminary data evaluate need full-scale trial hence human trial particular area far . The initial target 40 patient distribute 4 group 10 patient . Randomization Age DM ( Diabetes Mellitus ) associate many comorbidities . Randomization stratify two confounders . All trial candidate unique number identify conceal identity . Patients file lock trial office one person access candidate get number sequential way accord allocation . Projected recruitment Galway University hospital provide vascular service population approximately 750000 serve West-North West Hospitals Group . The patient trial actively recruit patient clinic , patient GP clinic send letter GPs ( General practitioner ) trial . Information trial give vascular team include criterion selection exclusion . Those qualified counselled trial team consent agree join . The target 40 patient achievable within recruitment window . Patient recruitment &amp; consent Eligible candidate give information trial write verbal explanation step . Patients willing take part ask provide write informed consent . Three copy consent form sign : one patient , one patient 's clinical note file one copy patient 's trial folder . Data collection Demographic clinical data eligible candidate agree participate collect . The candidate assign trial number identifier informed consent sign personal information available data entry sheet . The original data-entry proforma retain together copy consent form trial office trial document trial office CSI ( Clinical Science Institute ) building . The code key trial number limited Chief Investigator . Encrypted back copy prepared end data entry keep look separately . All data retain care principal investigator period five year closure trial . Statistical analysis The statistical analysis respect primary secondary outcome perform trial team member blind trial allocation . The cost-effectiveness analysis perform supervision trial health-economist ( confirm ) . This pilot study result identify need large trial . Trial monitor Day-to-day management trial responsibility trial manager , supervise principal investigator . A meeting hold every two week trial manager principal investigator monitor recruitment , data collection etc .</detailed_description>
