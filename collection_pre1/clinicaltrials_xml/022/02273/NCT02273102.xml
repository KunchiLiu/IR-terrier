	<brief_summary>Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) diverse disease fatal majority patient . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) however , subtype AML accounting 5 % case , curable . APL cell highly sensitive retinoid all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , effectively differentiate leukemic clone . Over 80 % APL patient cure ATRA base therapy . For patient non-APL AML , ATRA little effect . Consequently , 85 % patient succumb disease despite conventional approach . Little known mechanism resistance ATRA non-APL AML . This knowledge gap limit use ATRA disease already effective therapy . The investigator ' preliminary data suggest non-APL AML cell re-sensitized ATRA combine lysine-specific demethylase 1 ( LSD 1 ) inhibitor . The investigator ' publication Nature Medicine show LSD1 inhibition tranylcypromine ( TCP ) , unlocked ATRA-driven therapeutic response non-APL AML . Notably , treatment ATRA TCP markedly diminish engraftment primary human AML cell murine model , indicate combination may target leukemia-initiating cell ( LIC ) . The investigator ' data identify LSD1 therapeutic target strongly suggest may contribute ATRA resistance non-APL AML . The investigator ' central hypothesis ATRA combine TCP safe effective clinical population , approach suppress LICs restore myeloid differentiation program patient non-APL AML . Testing hypothesis phase I clinical trial outline protocol , establish new treatment paradigm AML extend important anti-cancer effect ATRA AML subtypes .</brief_summary>
