	<brief_summary>The main objective study show `` diaphragmatic excursion measure upon emergency admission '' ( CDA value ) patient acute respiratory failure predictive need use mechanical ventilation ( invasive non- ) first four hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time-motion-mode Ultrasound Diaphragm Measures Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : A-determine prognostic threshold diaphragmatic excursion measure able predict use mechanical ventilation ( invasive ) first four hour . B-to study association CDA value persistence respiratory distress first 4 hour care among patient , 4 hour , mechanically ventilate . C-to study association CDA value respiratory re-exacerbation continue need mechanical ventilation 24 first hour admission emergency room D-to study association diaphragmatic excursion measure make initial emergency care ( 4 hour ; =CDH4 ) , persistence respiratory distress 4 hour , patient 4 hour mechanically ventilate . E-to study association CDH4 value respiratory re-exacerbation 24 first hour admission emergency room among patient , 4 hour , mechanically ventilate F-to study association change value diaphragmatic excursion measure initial emergency care ( CDA â†’ CDH4 ) respiratory re-exacerbation 24 first hour admission emergency room among patient , 4 hour , mechanically ventilate . G-analyze patient outcome subgroup accord diagnosis ( decompensated COPD , OAP , lung disease , asthma , pleural disease ) .</detailed_description>
