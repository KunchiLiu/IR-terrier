	<brief_title>rTMS PTSD Comorbid With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate safety efficacy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) adult comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Although standard rTMS use stimulation deliver leave prefrontal cortex 10 pulse per second , prior work show stimulation frequency may work PTSD MDD . In study , examine efficacy left-sided 5Hz patient PTSD MDD , hypothesize low frequency improve PTSD MDD symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . To ensure subject safely receive rTMS , eligible subject must meet establish screen criterion safety MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , since MRI involve magnetic field similar intensity emit rTMS treatment coil . These conservative measure require patient following ( unless MRIsafe ) : Cardiac pacemaker , implant device ( deep brain stimulation ) metal brain , cervical spinal cord , upper thoracic spinal cord ; 2 . Outpatients 1870 year age ( inclusive ) 3 . Meet DSMIV criterion MDD ( recurrent single episode chronic ) PTSD ( acute chronic ) time screen baseline visit ; 4 . Have baseline score `` Moderately Ill '' bad CGIS PGIS . 5 . Have fail least one antidepressant medication trial part definitive adequate treatment current episode , OR demonstrate intolerance least one antidepressant medication part attempt treatment current episode illness ( i.e. , meet FDA label requirement administration rTMS depression ) ; 6 . Be stable psychotropic regimen least six week ( 42 day ) prior screen , psychotropic medication , willing maintain current regimen dose duration study ( unless medical necessary make change notification research staff ) ; 7 . If female child bear potential , agree use acceptable method birth control duration study treatment period 8 . Be willing able comply study related procedure visit , 9 . Be capable independently read understand patient information material give write informed consent . 1 . Are pregnant lactate plan become pregnant within next three month . 2 . Have lifetime history loss consciousness due head injury great 10 minute , lifetime history loss consciousness due head injury document evidence brain injury ( include brain atrophy ) . 3 . Current ( past appropriate ) significant neurological disorder , lifetime history ) seizure disorder b ) primary secondary CNS tumor c ) stroke ) cerebral aneurysm ; 4 . Current Axis 1 primary psychotic disorder , bipolar I disorder , current alcohol and/or substance dependence abuse within past 1 month ; 5 . Past treatment TMS therapy 6 . Have active suicidal intent plan detect screening assessment , Investigator 's opinion , likely attempt suicide within next six month . 7 .
