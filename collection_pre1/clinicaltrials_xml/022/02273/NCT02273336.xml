	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform comprehensive genomic analysis young lung cancer patient ' sample facilitate delivery target therapy clinical trial enrollment . II . To characterize impact young age lung cancer diagnosis genomic landscape primary lung cancer . III . To establish prospective registry young lung cancer patient tumor germline next generation sequence . OUTLINE : Tissue blood sample analyze via next generation sequence whole exome sequencing . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
