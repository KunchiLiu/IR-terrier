	<brief_title>Trial AEB071 Combination With BYL719 Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanoma common primary intraocular malignancy adult think particularly resistant systemic treatment , systemic therapy yet demonstrate improve survival . Drugs commonly use treat advance cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable response patient uveal melanoma . Because lack effective systemic treatment option , outcomes poor metastatic disease occur , median survival time development distant metastatic disease 6 12 month . Although clear novel effective therapy desperately need disease , development therapy hamper rarity uveal melanoma .</detailed_description>
