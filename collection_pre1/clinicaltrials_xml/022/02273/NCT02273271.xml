	<brief_title>Evaluation FLT-PET DWI-MRI Patients With NSCLC Treated With Platinum-based Doublet Preoperative Chemo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single-arm image trial . Patients NSCLC undergo 18F-FLT-PET/CT DWI-MRI scan three separate occasion : baseline , 14 day ( maximum +/- 1 day deviation acceptable ) first administration chemotherapy finally 4 cycle chemotherapy , follow surgery . The quantification 18F-FLT SUV ADC measure assess tumor characteristic response therapy . Patients first register EORTC system sign informed consent form . The site complete study relate procedure within 6 week prior treatment eligibility criterion meet patient enrol study . Both 18F-FLT-PET/CT DWI-MRI assess independently trial . Therefore overall type I error 0.1 split two order test independently image biomarker one-sided type I error 0.05 . In order demonstrate 95 % confidence interval ( one side ) correlation image biomarker change pathological response &gt; 0.5 ( H0 : rho ≤ 0.5 ) 90 % power true correlation 0.8 ( H1 : rho &gt; 0.5 ) , 31 lesion need . As , population , patient primary tumor , 31 eligible evaluable patient need primary endpoint . If included patient 18F-FLT-PET/CT DWI-MRI 31 eligible evaluable patient enough . If patient one type scan ( 18F-FLT-PET/CT DWI-MRI ) , sample size would need adapted 31 patient type scan . In addition , total number patient register may increase 40 patient primary endpoint take account screening failure . For primary analysis correlation relative change image biomarkers ( 18F-FLT-SUV ADC ) pathological quantification , correlation coefficient report use one-sided 95 % confidence interval , test one-sided comparison null hypothesis ( H0 : ρ ≤ 0.5 ) . All secondary objective correlate preoperative imaging biomarkers IHC biological marker tumor volume use analysis cite 99 % confidence interval . All measure analyze random effect ANOVA model allow within center-variability . Quality assurance plan control data consistency , on-site monitoring , audit , quality assurance pathological response assessment imaging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year WHO performance status 01 ( Appendix C ) Histologically cytological confirm clinical stage IIIIIA nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , accord 7th TNM classification ( Appendix D ) ( NOTE : patient resectable N2 disease also eligible ) Baseline standard image assessment &amp; staging perform within 6 week prior plan treatment start . Patients must candidate curative intent surgery , must expect complete treatment . ♦♦ Adequate hematology biochemical investigation , ( do maximum 6 week treatment start ) Normal bone marrow function base routine blood sample , i.e . neutrophil ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , platelet ≥ 75 x 109/L , hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL Normal kidney function creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min , Normal liver function assess routine laboratory examination , i.e . bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT &lt; 3 x ULN Patients must contraindication 18FFLTPET/CT MRI procedure . Patient primary lung tumor large 20 mm diameter ( measure diagnostic CT MRI ) . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum ( urine ) pregnancy test trial registration . Patients childbearing / reproductive potential use adequate birth control measure , define investigator , study treatment period least 6 month last study procedure . A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Female subject breast feed discontinue nurse trial registration . Before patient registration , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP , national/local regulation . Prior current anticancer treatment NSCLC , preoperative therapy include chemotherapeutic drug ( pemetrexed contraindicate ) , biological , targeted radiotherapy allow Treatment investigational drug substance within 4 week prior registration . Other malignancy 3 year prior study entry exception surgically cure carcinoma situ cervix , situ breast cancer , incidental finding stage T1a T1b prostate cancer , basal/squamous cell carcinoma skin Evidence medical condition would impair ability patient participate trial might preclude therapy chemotherapeutic drug accord routine medical practice ( e.g . unstable uncompensated respiratory , cardiac , hepatic renal disease , know dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency , active infection , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ; uncontrolled arterial hypertension , history unstable myocardial infarction ) Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient randomization trial .</criteria>
