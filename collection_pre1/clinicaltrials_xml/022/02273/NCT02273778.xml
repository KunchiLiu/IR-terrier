	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy commonly use treat advance cancer head neck , aim cure preserve patient ' quality life include ability speak swallow . In order reduce potentially major side effect treatment , essential high dos radiotherapy target main bulk tumour . At present computerized tomography ( CT ) scan use cancer specialist identify tumour plan radiotherapy treatment . The investigator know type scan include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan good CT scan show area involve cancer . However , radiotherapy directly plan type scan . The aim study explore whether PET MRI scan combine CT scan accurately identify tumour target . In addition , study explore whether PETCT MRI scan may use adjust radiotherapy well tumour respond course radiotherapy . If radiotherapy planning process improve way , investigator hope future patient benefit chance cure reduction side effect treatment . The study aim recruit 16 patient . All patient within study undergo PETCT MRI scan prior start treatment part study . A subgroup 8 patient undergo additional imaging two timepoints course radiotherapy . The study noninterventional patient ' standard treatment affect participation study .</brief_summary>
