	<brief_summary>A novel handheld Doppler develop rugged powered hand crank . This study aim test use Doppler versus Pinard horn monitor fetal heart rate labour hospital set Uganda . The investigator propose ease use , woman midwife , midwives use Doppler identify baby need prompt delivery risk stillbirth neonatal mortality decline . In research study , investigator compare risk stillbirth neonatal mortality two randomized group labour woman . The second part study consist audit documentation labour midwife . The partograph uncomplicated , low cost form observation labour document . It include three section information : fetal condition , maternal condition labour progress . Although use partograph labour strongly recommend WHO , limit publish systematic evaluation correct use tool . The investigator aim use randomize trial design ass rate intrapartum stillbirth neonatal mortality first 24 hour delivery , assess quality partographs compare two group . This trial provide insight potential benefit use handheld Doppler device intrapartum monitoring , audit partograph quality provide insight improve care labour . This study hypothesize quality partograph completion fetal heart rate monitoring may systematically differ Doppler Pinard group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives : 1 . To evaluate intervention wind-up , handheld Doppler fetal heart rate monitor ( Doppler ) identify implementation challenge ; 2 . To identify process issue impact Doppler rate intrapartum stillbirth neonatal death within 24 hour , comparison use Pinard horn ( current practice ) ; 3 . To assess quality partographs use standardize score system audit overall completion quality , fetal heart rate monitoring specifically ; compare audit result partographs monitor do Pinard horn versus Doppler . The hypothesis quality partograph completion fetal heart rate monitoring may systematically differ two group ; 4 . To build research capacity Ugandan midwives facilitate participation research study . 2 . Study design Equal randomization clinical trial compare Pinard horn ( current practice ) versus Doppler ( intervention ) monitor fetal heart labour . 3 . Characteristics study population 1 . Number participant Based result randomize controlled trial urban Zimbabwe 1994 [ Mahomed , BMJ ] , investigator hypothesize use handheld Doppler fetal heart monitor reduce rate intrapartum stillbirth least 30 % compare monitoring fetal heart rate Pinard horn . With 80 % power detect least 30 % reduction stillbirths 95 % confidence , 840 labouring woman would need enrolled two comparison group . Adding 20 % allow loss follow-up statistical adjustments/stratification , 1008 labour woman require comparison group . 2 . Location research The study conduct San Raphael St Francis Hospital Nsambya Hospital , Uganda . This general hospital maternity locate peri-urban region Kampala City . It private not-for-profit institution 7,500 annual delivery . In addition , offer train resident , intern doctor , nurse , midwife technician . 4 . Data analysis The investigator review partograph record find tool develop purpose . The data record statistical nature bottom Partograph Assessment Tool space qualitative comment reviewer . Besides date birth patient file identity number data record reveal identity patient . This ensure patient privacy confidentiality data , without lose possibility retrieve file medical record need . After record data hard copy hospital , data enter twice statistical package analysis . The information give descriptively analyse . The proportion incidence risk rate participant experience fetal outcome study mean partograph score compare intervention control group .</detailed_description>
