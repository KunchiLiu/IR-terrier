	<brief_title>Human Study Hydroxytyrosol Phase II Enzymes Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxytyrosol peculiar olive ( , hence , olive oil ) exploit potential supplement preservative employed nutraceutical , cosmeceutical , food industry . One property describe hydroxytyrosol high antioxidant activity . Also , hydroxytyrosol able modulate several enzymatic activity link cardiovascular disease . Animal experiment confirm hydroxytyrosol retains antioxidant activity ingest ( though human metabolic pathway elucidate show extensive glucuronidation subsequent urinary excretion ) , protect second hand smoke-induced oxidative damage , inhibit platelet aggregation , ameliorate lipid profile decrease atherosclerosis development , increase brain cell resistance oxidation mitochondrial membrane potential Several mechanism propose explain biologically polyphenols protect degenerative disease . It think likely phytochemical , include polyphenols , process body xenobiotics . They stimulate stress- related cell signal pathway result increase expression gene encode cytoprotective gene . Nrf2 ( NF-E2-related factor 2 ) transcription factor bind Antioxidant Response Element ( ARE ) cell thus regulate enzyme involve antioxidant function detoxification ( e.g . thioredoxin reductase-1 glutathione peroxidase ) . Polyphenols might increase gene transcription Nrf2 mediate response element . This provide ground theory hormesis , i.e . mild stress trigger defense mechanism . In case polyphenols indicates could indirect antioxidant action . That plan carry study explore detoxify potential hydroxytyrosol effect Phase II enzyme expression ( lead xenobiotics detoxification liver ) . ItÂ´ll randomize crossover , pilot study examine effect two dos hydroxytyrosol , form commercially-available raw mixture : 1 ) provide 5 mg/d ; 2 ) 25 mg/d , one week one-week washout period , 6 week . The investigator recruit 20 healthy volunteer , within participate Genyal Platform study AT IMDEA-Food Institute .</detailed_description>
