	<brief_title>Is Pre-contrast Scan Necesary Diagnose Acute Aortic Syndrome ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAS include : tear wall main artery heart , bleed directly wall , ulcer wall , excess dilatation rupture main artery wall . These also treat differently accord length aorta . It therefore important identify precisely subtype AAS location allow clinician manage patient appropriately . Current practice image two CT scan chest , one injection contrast dye blood stream one . The one contrast use determine bleed within wall , would show white scan . It currently accept contrast artery would hide presence bleed within wall . The cause see primarily contrast scan . Every patient proceeds pre-contrast scan contrast scan , unless contraindication intravenous dye . The investigator database search show radiologist protocol scan accord preference experience ( i.e . scan , others contrast scan ) . There conflict advice international professional body whether perform non-contrast scan every time . Some study show although pre-contrast scan sensitive picking bleeding within wall , add nothing increase radiation dose patient . The investigator hypothesise perform contrast scan diagnostically equivalent pre- contrast scan look 4 entity make AAS . The investigator also propose require pre-contrast scan would significant saving patient radiation dose , scanner time , network resource radiologist time .</detailed_description>
