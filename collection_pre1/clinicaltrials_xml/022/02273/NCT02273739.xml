	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase 1/2 , multi-center study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics clinical activity AG-221 subject advance solid tumor , include glioma , angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) , IDH2 mutation . The first portion study dose escalation phase cohorts patient receive ascend oral dos AG-221 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose . The second portion study plan dose expansion phase three cohort patient receive AG-221 evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity . Anticipated time study treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur .</brief_summary>
