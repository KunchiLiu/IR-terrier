We thus want create new face scale teddy bear face , cross-cultural timeless . Our objective validate new teddy scale paper shape wide sample child . We make hypothesis teddy scale would enable evaluate pain way FPS-R , well accept preferred child . The first phase study develop teddy scale sample 30 healthy child 4 11 year-old , already experienced pain . This stage allow validation image choose scale , make sure relevance optimal recognition child . The scale validate sample 218 hospitalized child 2 11 year old , pain usually evaluate systematic way . Children 4 11 year old simultaneously teddy scale , VAS FPS-R . They ask determine scale prefer . Children 2 4 year old teddy scale ; FLACC fill parent . Tested hypothesis : The discriminate characteristic teddy scale superior FPS-R scale The validation teddy scale enable objectify child 's pain , facilitate decision-making choice analgesic prescribe , check efficiency decision . This teddy scale could use current practice replacement FPS-R . Following study , plan set second project teddy scale adapted electronic form ( touchpads ) , test adaptability child .</brief_summary>
