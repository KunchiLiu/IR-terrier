	<brief_summary>To collect evidence safety administer autologous tolerogenic dendritic cell ( ATDC ) preparation living-donor renal transplant recipient context international European Union fund consortium aim evaluationg cellular immunotherapy solid organ transplantation ( The ONE Study ) . It anticipate immune regulation induce ATDC therapy evntually use reduce need conventional immunosuppression transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ONE Study ATDC Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decades immunosuppressive drug development produce array powerful pharmacological agent , various drawback associate treatment leave considerable room improvement . By harness power suppressive mechanism human immune system , regulatory cell therapy may able support peripheral tolerance induce level donor-specific unresponsiveness allows reduction use conventional immunosuppression organ transplant recipient . Several alternative regulatory cell type identify potential adjunct immunotherapy solid organ transplantation approach stage development would allow clinical test early-stage trial . The ONE Study aim answer question whether ATDC treatment , immunoregulatory cell-based therapy general , place clinical management solid organ transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
