	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) major global health problem associate substantial cost resource utilization . Currently , CKD affect 500 million people worldwide . Patients CKD unacceptably high mortality rate due cardiovascular ( CV ) cause , entirely explain traditional CV risk factor . The mortality rate advance CKD six time higher compare Medicare population , CVD account overwhelming majority death . Insulin resistance ( IR ) common CKD patient may represent central link CKD increase CVD risk observe population . Insulin resistance may increase CV risk impair worsen endothelial function , increase reactive oxygen specie , exacerbate systemic inflammation-hence , insulin resistance consider `` non-traditional CV risk factor '' CKD . Obesity ( define body mass index [ BMI ] least 30 kg/m2 ) major public health problem-the upward trend obesity prevalence across region continent worldwide concern . Obesity increase risk cardiovascular disease death . In general population , obesity hastens death 9.4 year . Obesity independent risk factor CKD . Besides contribution development diabetes hypertension , increase fat mass may also direct impact kidney function . In spite increase prevalence obesity CKD , impact obesity CKD population know , especially term exaggerate metabolic disturbance associate coexistence . It highly likely two condition profound interaction exaggerate severity metabolic derangement coexist , particularly regard adipokine dysregulation , risk `` insulin resistance '' , downstream effect vascular health . The current proposal attempt characterize relative combine impact obesity CKD metabolic disturbance , may aid risk stratification identify specific target intervention . The ultimate goal proposal understand relative combine impact obesity CKD generation maintenance insulin resistance impact cardiovascular health . Specific Aim 2 : To study effect metformin , AMPK activator , metabolic disturbance associate obesity moderate CKD . S.A.2.a : To test metformin improve LAR obese patient moderate CKD compare placebo . S.A.2.b : To test metformin improve marker systemic inflammation , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction obese patient moderate CKD compare placebo . S.A.2.c : To test metformin improve atherosclerosis marker reduce clinical CVD event obese patient moderate CKD compare placebo . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize administration metformin obese CKD patient significantly improve adipokine profiles-particularly reduction LAR . Additionally , improve systemic inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial function , may may mediate change adipokines . Finally , investigator hypothesize improvement marker vascular health translate reduce arterial stiffness less clinical CV event</brief_summary>
