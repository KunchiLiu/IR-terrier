	<detailed_description>Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) occur ~ 2-4/1000 term infant major cause neonatal morbidity mortality . Resulting neurologic deficit include disable cerebral palsy abnormality speech , vision intellect 50-70 % survive infant . To date , therapeutic hypothermia start within 6 h birth intervention know effective reduce morbidity mortality HIE . Hypothermia totally reverse injury many infant associated side effect may compromise effectiveness . For example , hypothermia cause intense shiver block neuroprotective effect therapeutic hypothermia newborn model . Low dose morphine often use reduce shiver infant undergo therapeutic hypothermia , escalate dos sedatives/analgesics often require . Escalating dos opioids benzodiazepine cause respiratory depression either cause need prolong mechanical ventilation . Agonists central a2 - adrenergic receptor effective reduce postoperative shiver opioid receptor agonist provide analgesia sedation without respiratory depression . More importantly , newborn adult animal model brain injury , a2 - adrenergic receptor agonist provide neuroprotection . Clonidine a-2 adrenergic receptor agonist broadly use ( off-label ) several disorder infant child . It known class sedative-analgesic agent beneficial infant HIE . Little known immaturity , end organ damage therapeutic hypothermia affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ( PK/PD ) sedatives-analgesics . The desirable sedative-analgesic agent use infant HIE would : ( ) excellent safety profile , ( b ) reduce shiver , ( c ) provide adequate analgesia sedation , ( ) cause minimal respiratory depression , ( e ) preserve cerebrovascular autoregulation , ( f ) confer neuroprotection . Several line evidence suggest a2-adrenergic receptor agonist class sedatives-analgesics may property . We develop sensitive assay measure clonidine plasma level allow u characterize population PK/PD parameter clonidine high risk infant . We tool , expertise patient population conduct phase I/II trial test hypotheses clonidine safe reduce incidence shiver without adversely affect heart rate , blood pressure , temperature regulation cerebrovascular autoregulation . Data trial inform study design large randomized-double-blind trial determine clonidine adjunct therapeutic hypothermia improve neurological outcome high risk population .</detailed_description>
