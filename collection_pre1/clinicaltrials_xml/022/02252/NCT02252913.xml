	<brief_title>A Study Safety Pharmacokinetics Volitinib With Docetaxel Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase Ib , open-label study . There two stage study : dose-escalation stage dose-expansion stage . Approximately 40-50 patient enrol two-stage study , 12-18 patient dose-escalation stage approximately 30 patient dose-expansion stage . Dose escalation stage Gastric cancer patient fail first line therapy ( matter cMet status ) meet eligibility criterion enrol stage . Cohort 1 : Volitinib 600mg QD + docetaxel 75mg/m2 Cohort 2 : Volitinib 800mg QD+ docetaxel 75mg/m2 The conventional 3+3 design ( 3 patient per dose cohort , potential add additional 3 patient cohort evaluate toxicity ) apply dose escalation MTD RP2D determination . Each treatment cycle compose 3 week 21 day . Dose escalation entry next cohort occur acceptable tolerance demonstrate throughout entire Cycle1 . Dose expansion Stage Additional patient enrol MTD RP2D refine safety , tolerability , PK , efficacy dose . Patients limited metastatic / locally advance gastric cancer patient fail first therapy positive cMet test result . Patients divide two treatment group accord c-Met test result : Group A : FISH + , IHC -/+ ( 15 patient ) Group B : IHC+ FISH- ( 15 patient )</detailed_description>
