	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess two type new malaria vaccine different combination . The study enable u ass : 1 . The ability vaccine prevent malaria infection . 2 . The safety vaccine healthy participant . 3 . The response human immune system vaccine . We give 48 participant three set vaccination 8 week , expose malaria infection allow mosquito infect malaria bite carefully regulate condition . We follow participant closely observe develop malaria . If vaccine combination provide protection malaria , participant take long develop malaria usual develop malaria . We also recruit 4 individual control subject - participant wo n't receive vaccination challenge malaria . Vaccinated volunteer develop malaria infection blood infect malaria mosquito bite first time may invite back infected malaria repeat challenge experiment . This would happen approximately 5-7 month first challenge . The purpose second challenge see long protection investigational vaccine malaria last .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult age 18 45 year . Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement . Willing allow investigator discuss volunteer 's medical history General Practitioner . Women : Must practice continuous effective contraception duration study . Agreement refrain blood donation course study least 3 year end involvement study . Written inform consent participate trial . Reachable ( 24/7 ) mobile phone period Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( CHMI ) completion antimalarial treatment . Willingness take curative antimalaria regimen follow CHMI . For volunteer live Oxford : agreement stay hotel room close trial centre part study ( least day 6.5 post mosquito bite antimalarial treatment complete ) . Answer question inform consent quiz correctly . History clinical malaria ( specie ) . Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month significant risk malaria exposure . Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day CHMI ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . If volunteer Group 14 undergo rechallenge , exclusion criterion extend vaccine previously receive trial Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( e.g . egg product , Kathon ) malaria infection . Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . History clinically significant contact dermatitis . History sickle cell anaemia , sickle cell trait , thalassaemia thalassaemia trait haematological condition could affect susceptibility malaria infection . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Use medication know cause prolongation QT interval exist contraindication use Malarone Use medication know potentially clinically significant interaction Riamet Malarone Any clinical condition know prolong QT interval History cardiac arrhythmia , include clinically relevant bradycardia Disturbances electrolyte balance , eg , hypokalaemia hypomagnesaemia Family history congenital QT prolongation sudden death Contraindications use three propose antimalarial medication ; Riamet , Malarone Chloroquine . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 standard UK unit every week . Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) detect serum . Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) screening ( unless take part prior hepatitis C vaccine study confirm negative HCV antibody prior participation study , negative HCV RNA PCR screen study ) . An estimate , ten year risk fatal cardiovascular disease â‰¥5 % , estimate Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) system.59 Positive family history 1st 2nd degree relative &lt; 50 year old cardiac disease . Volunteers unable closely follow social , geographic psychological reason . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . In event abnormal test result , confirmatory repeat test request . Any significant disease , disorder , find may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
