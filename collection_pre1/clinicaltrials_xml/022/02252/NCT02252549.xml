	<detailed_description>This study multicenter randomize control trial recurrence rate cancer SPIES assist WLI assist TURB compare . Randomization stratify tumor multiplicity ( single multiple ) , tumor status ( primary recurrent ) macroscopic finding ( papillary flat , CIS score flat lesion ) . Patients randomize experimental arm ( Arm A ) undergo SPIES WLI assist TURB , whereas patient control arm ( Arm B ) undergo WLI assist TURB . WLI chosen control , since consider gold standard detect bladder tumor . Short long term follow record order evaluate health gain patient longer period . Perioperative ( 30 day ) complication compare two treatment arm evaluate safety SPIES .</detailed_description>
