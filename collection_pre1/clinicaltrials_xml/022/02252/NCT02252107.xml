	<brief_summary>This study examine whether addition decitabine standard Flu/TBI conditioning regimen prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation poor poor risk AML patient , reduces risk recurrence disease . Because decitabine hardly side effect , likely little impact occurrence Graft Versus Host Disease . The investigator look pre-treatment transplantation reduces chance recurrence disease without involve severe damage normal tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) heterogeneous group malignant hematological disease different molecular genetic abnormality . These important predicting response treatment . Recently , analysis 424 AML patient treat various HOVON protocol show 5 year overall survival patient good , intermediate , poor poor risk group 65 % , 51 % , 25 % 7 % respectively ( HOVON 102 protocol ) . This show especially patient ( ) poor risk group , outcome disappointing , despite current treatment strategy . For patient intermediate , poor poor risk cytogenetics postconsolidation treatment allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo HCT ) standard practice myeloablative ( MAB HCT ) non-myeloablative ( NMA HCT ) conditioning . Unfortunately , mortality MAB conditioning still considerable , mainly due therapy related mortality , graft-versus-host disease , infection , relapse . Currently , NMA conditioning use frequently , far less toxic . Nonmyeloablative regimen rely immunological anti-leukemia effect ( graft-versus-leukemia ) , prevent relapse disease . This anti-leukemia effect , however , need time develop , make necessary control disease pre-transplantation much possible . This extend time immune system donor develop adequate anti-leukemia effect , especially important ( ) poor risk group patient since high chance relapse . Epigenetic alteration increasingly recognise role oncogenesis . These alteration example 'silence'genes hypermethylation . These alteration potentially reversible . The hypomethylating agent decitabine one therapeutic approach reactivate silence gene interaction epigenetics . A phase II study ( Blum , Proc Natl Acad Sci 2010 ) 53 AML patient receive 10 day decitabine , show complete remission rate ( CR ) 47 % patient . This percentage correspond CR intensive chemotherapy elderly AML patient . The median survival 55 week . Furthermore , study show decitabine well tolerate . Earlier study show patient whose disease control hypomethylating agent pre-transplantation comparable survival compare patient whose disease control intensive chemotherapy ( Damaj , Journal Clinical Oncology , 2012 ) . In current study AML already remission intensive chemotherapy . In attempt design condition strategy low toxicity considerable myelosuppressive activity , investigator combine non-myeloablative ( NMA ) fludarabine low-dose TBI ( 2 Gray ) 10-day schedule decitabine ( Dec-Flu-TBI ) . Theoretically , attractive add drug like decitabine ( 10-day schedule ) exert strong antileukemic effect , without additional extra-medullary toxicity , standard Flu-TBI NMA condition regimen . The hypothesis way investigator extent time immune system donor need create adequate graft-versus-leukemia effect , cost low toxicity .</detailed_description>
