	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether High Frequency Digit Triplet test use screen patient cystic fibrosis hearing loss condition health pulmonary exacerbation . It also design find young age child perform test , prevalence hearing loss CF population prevalence genetic mutation know associated hearing loss population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation High Frequency Digit Triplet Test Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients identify clinic list four Cystic Fibrosis centre ( Nottingham University Hospitals NHS ( National Health Service ) Trust , adult child , West Midlands Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre Birmingham Children 's Hospital ) . In first work stream patient 11 year old answer hearing screen question ear examination tympanogram . They new test ( High Frequency Digit Triplet , HFDT , test ) , standard test ( Pure tone audiogram ( PTA ) include high frequency , Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions ) repeat new test look order effect . These compare validate HFDT screen tool hearing loss . In second work stream investigator look see test feasible patient unwell start course IV antibiotic . The patient test work stream 1 ( though high-frequency PTA may modify unwell complete ) . They test repeat next clinic visit ( approximately 6-8 week later ) . In third work stream child age 5-10 year test . This discover young age HFDT test reliably perform . To ensure CF condition affect ability perform test investigator compare CF child healthy control child age . The investigator take blood saliva sample CF patient look mutation mitochondrial gene know associated aminoglycoside induce hearing loss .</detailed_description>

For age 11 18 year , consent seek parent young person ( provide young person competent ) . Work stream 2 â€¢ As participant pulmonary exacerbation ( define Fuch 's criterion ) require intravenous antibiotic . Work stream 3 As work stream 1 , define . CF patient age 510 year Healthy control child age 510 year . Informed consent parent assent child . Genetic Testing Informed consent Diagnosis CF Exclusion criterion None . In individual hear aid , perform PTA HFDT test without aid . Individuals find conductive deafness randomisation fully assess prior continue study .</criteria>
