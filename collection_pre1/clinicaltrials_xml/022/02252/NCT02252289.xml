	<brief_summary>It increasingly recognise asthma single disease many different phenotype . Much work previously carry focussed differentiate child difficult asthma ( whose asthma control improve attention basic asthma management adherence ) severe therapy resistant asthma ( ongoing poor control despite high dose treatment attention basic . Our collaborator Basel , Switzerland demonstrate serial measurement lung function ( peak flow ) adult characterise severe asthma phenotype stability adult asthma . We plan carry twice daily peak flow measurement sin child asthma use electronic peak flow meter . We analyse peak flow pattern child severe therapy resistant asthma ( STRA ) , difficult asthma ( DA ) mild moderate asthma . We also investigate relationship peak flow variation symptom , record daily diary medication use , record electronic measuring device attach child 's inhaler ( Smart-inhaler ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many child present poorly control asthma despite high intensity treatment include high dos inhale steroid . A number child get good basic asthma management address ( adherence , allergen avoidance , smoke cessation ) . The remainder need escalation treatment ( attendant side effect ) invasive , investigation . Adults severe asthma find difference fluctuation pattern peak flow compare mild asthmatic . This study enable u evaluate whether true child , enable u improve way identify child difficult asthma ( DA ) severe therapy resistant asthma ( STRA ) whether difficult asthma : DA group fact similar mild/moderate group . Asthma exacerbation serious concern problem child asthma . This study enable u ass whether mathematical model fluctuation pattern enable u predict n asthma attack therefore intervene becomes severe even life threaten . This study also enable u investigate relationship symptom , peak flow pattern , exacerbation adherence inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) measure electronic recording device ( Smart-inhalers ) . This observational cohort study . If child family happy participate study first study visit take place immediately . If would like time consider study defer next routine attendance hospital . Study visit 1 : Information collect relate past medical history , asthma history current medication ( information may also obtain case note ) . The follow standardised questionnaire use : Asthma Control Test , child &gt; 12 year ( ACT ) Childhood Asthma Control Test , child 6-11years ( cACT ) ( usually complete part routine clinical visit ) 余 Mini Paediatric Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) 余 Medicines Adherence Rating Scale ( MARS ) 余 Beliefs Medicines Questionnaire ( BMQ ) . Study procedure : Lung function ( included part routine clinic visit ) , bronchodilator reversibility ( lung function repeat administration salbutamol ) , exhale nitric oxide . The child family issue paper diary , electronic peak flow meter ( PIKO ) electronic monitoring device inhaler ( Smart-inhaler ) show use . Between visit : Children ask measure peak flow twice daily ( morning evening ) record symptom diary . Their parent also ask complete diary . They contact study investigator check whether technical problem reminder make peak flow measurement complete diary . Visit 2 , approximately 12 week later ( 8 16 week ) The second study visit schedule time plan hospital appointment . This largely repeat visit 1 : Information collect relate asthma control exacerbation since visit 1 . The follow standardised questionnaire use : Asthma Control Test , child &gt; 12 year ( ACT ) Childhood Asthma Control Test , child 6-11years ( cACT ) ( usually complete part routine clinical visit ) 余 Mini Paediatric Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) Study procedure : Lung function ( included part routine clinic visit ) , bronchodilator reversibility ( lung function repeat administration salbutamol ) , exhale nitric oxide .</detailed_description>
