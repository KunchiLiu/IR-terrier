	<brief_title>Can Entertaining Action-video Games Enhance Dynamic Visual Function Improve Balance ? A Randomized Controlled Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Balance control important component even simple daily task like walk . However , age , physical visual function would gradually deteriorate even absence health eye problem . Improving elderly balance control different train one way prevent fall . In project , investigate use action video game , easy-to-find entertaining , visual function trainer improve balance old adult . We hypothesize train would show improvement balance dynamic vision . Our primary hypothesis postural sway static dynamic balance measure improve action video-game intervention . For secondary outcome measure , hypothesize train improve dynamic visual function ( measure dynamic visual acuity dynamic contrast sensitivity ) , visual attention measure ( measure useful field view , multiple object track spatial attention ) .</detailed_description>
