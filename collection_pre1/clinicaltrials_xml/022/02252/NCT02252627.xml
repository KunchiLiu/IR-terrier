	<brief_summary>During operation treat abdominal problem blood pressure fall , result fall blood flow vital organ . This fall treat administration drug cause constriction blood vessel . Although drug correct fall blood pressure , unclear effect blood flow heart vital organ . In study healthy volunteer aim good understand change blood flow small large vessel occur response administration drug . To use two different technique ultrasound image . A narrow ( 4-5mm ) ultrasound probe insert oesophagus via nostril measure blood flow major blood vessel . A second probe rest abdomen record change blood flow small vessel liver . Two drug raise blood pressure via different mechanism administer change flow heart vital organ measure compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Phenylephrine Ephedrine Microvascular Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimising cardiac output essential ensure adequate organ perfusion patient undergo major surgery . To enable cardiac output ( CO ) frequently monitor operation use variety technique ; one technique trans-oesophageal Doppler ultrasound also know oesophageal Doppler monitoring ( ODM ) . ODM measurement CO less invasive technique many currently use method , recently recommend NICE adoption clinical practice . The match microvascular blood flow CO advantageous visceral organ , marry demand oxygen nutrient delivery . Major surgery attendant requirement general anaesthesia result dramatic change blood pressure ( BP ) CO . These change correct administration vasoactive drug phenylephrine ephedrine , although unclear effect drug microvascular blood flow ( MVBF ) intra-abdominal viscera . Whilst correct fall BP , hence may increase visceral flow , increase BP partially mediate via splanchnic vasoconstriction , may result decreased blood flow . A great appreciation effect vasoactive drug CO MVBF may help development refine algorithm use clinical setting . In clinical physiology laboratory regularly employ contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) use Phillips iU22 , measure MVBF healthy male follow variety physiological challenge . This minimally invasive ultrasound base imaging technique ideal gain insight effect various physiological intervention tissue blood flow could readily use chart change visceral MVBF CO follow vasoactive drug administration . Transference investigative approach clinical set potential greatly improve care surgical patient anaesthesia .</detailed_description>
