	<brief_title>Effect Anti-Inflammatory Agents Biological Responses Endotoxin Inhalation Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-center , parallel-group clinical trial design evaluate Humira® methylprednisolone versus treatment healthy subject apply inhaled endotoxin challenge . A total 30 healthy adult subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomise 1:1:1 ratio one follow cohort : - Cohort 1 subject receive study drug study . - Cohort 2 subject receive oral 7-day course corticosteroid ( methylprednisolone ) study , start study Day 1 . The daily dose 20 mg. - Cohort 3 subject receive single subcutaneous injection anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( adalimumab ) study Day 1 , administer 40 mg dose . The study include Screening period 21 day , subject eligibility assess Screening response endotoxin exposure challenge collect . Eligible subject initially undergo 8-day treatment period , receive treatment base assign cohort ( receive treatment assign Cohort 1 ) apply endotoxin challenge . After treatment period , subject follow study Day 42 . Efficacy evaluation include specific response endotoxin challenge , effect methylprednisolone adalimumab response . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
