	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesis electrical stimulation tongue directly stimulate two cranial nerve nucleus ( Trigeminal Facial Nerve Nuclei ) , excite neural impulse brainstem cerebellum . The investigator call cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation ( CN-NINM ) . The activation structure induces neuroplasticity combine specific physical exercise , reduce symptom advanced MS , target primarily postural stability ( sit stand ) , upper extremity movement , ability perform self-transfers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Use Non-invasive Neuromodulation Combined With Exercise People With Advanced Multiple Sclerosis ( MS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention similar use investigator previous work movement disorder , tailor address issue unique individual advance MS . The study enroll total 6 subject advance MS present significant seat stand balance , posture , movement control deficit due MS . Subjects complete twice-daily lab train two week ( 5 days/week ) . Each lab training ( morning afternoon ) include 1.5 2 hour instruction balance , posture gait activity ; therapeutic exercise isolated muscle control ; transfer training ; relaxation training . Activities perform 20-minute session concomitant electrical stimulation tongue . The intervention customize accord subject 's particular symptom tolerance . If subject able perform amount training , train adapt level tolerable . After 2 week , subject continue perform intervention activity home 4 week . They return lab 1 week training testing , perform home train 4 week . This cycle repeat total 5 cycle . After 6 month complete , subject may choose participate optional second phase study . The second phase include additional 12 month participation subject perform intervention activity home train return lab time per month 2 hour test 2 hour train . If successful , study would indicate CN-NINM intervention may reduce symptom advanced MS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must age 18 old . Subjects score 6.5 7.5 Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) . The EDSS method quantify disability people multiple sclerosis . Score 6.5 : need constant bilateral support walk 20 meter without rest . Score 7.0 : unable walk beyond five meter even aid , essentially restrict wheelchair ; wheel self transfer alone , active wheelchair 12 hour day . Score 7.5 : unable take step restrict wheelchair , may need aid transfer ; wheel self , may require motorized chair full day 's activity . Subjects reach plateau MS focus physical rehabilitation program 6 month prior enrollment . Requiring prior physical therapy ensure subject core level function allow participate study . Requiring subject reach plateau ensure subject ' response intervention due use device physical exercise alone . Subjects participate physical rehabilitation program demonstrate willing able commit rigorous train regimen . Subjects maximum score 20 Trunk Impairment Scale ( TIS ) . The TIS assess static dynamic sit balance trunk coordination sit position . A score 20 low indicates ability adequately maintain sit posture affect . Subjects may upper extremity involvement . Subjects may additional symptom nystagmus , dysarthria , sensory disturbance , pain , and/or bowel bladder function . As present , use appropriate assessment baseline successive study test point . Subjects legal guardian , able understand give informed consent . Subjects major comorbidities , especially neurological disorder , uncontrolled pain , hypertension diabetes . All subject , medication , major change type dosage within 3 month enrollment . Additionally , candidate exclude : Functional Systems Scores ( FSS ) 4 great pyramidal , cerebellar , brainstem , sensory function ; 3 great bowel bladder function ; 2 great cerebral function ; able walk independently ; use tobacco product ( activity tend reduce tactile sensitivity oral cavity ) ; oral abrasion , cut , cold sore , piercings , tissue inflammation , oral surgery within previous 3 month ; pacemaker , identify atrisk cardiovascular event ; history seizure ; communicable disease ; biomechanical prosthetic ; female pregnant .</criteria>
