	<brief_summary>Objectives : To analyze effect proprioceptive strengthening exercise versus exercise manual therapy recurrent ankle sprain management . Design : A randomized clinical trial two intervention group triple blind . Settings : University Hospital . Participants : Fifty-four patient previous history recurrent ankle sprain , regular sport practice pain physical activity , randomly assign experimental control group . Intervention : Control group perform 4 week proprioceptive strengthening exercise ; experimental group perform 4 week exercise combine manual therapy . Main Outcomes Measures : Pain , ankle instability , pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) , ankle eversion strength , active range motion ankle joint . The measure take , one month intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The recurrent ankle sprain mean frequent complication ankle sprain previous phase chronic ankle stability ( CAI ) , involve 20 - 41 % ankle sprain . Residual pain concern first symptom instability case , patient also show reduced ankle joint position sense , ankle range motion , strength ankle inversion muscle . Proprioception exercise multiplane unstable platform , well strengthen eccentric exercise report benefit pain function , suggest active therapy effective treatment instead passive manual therapy chronic phase . However , several study analyze effect manual therapy management ankle sprain recurrence : posterior glide astragalus tibiotarsal joint coaptation improve ankle range motion , related recurrent ankle sprain residual symptom . Despite benefit active passive therapy , author date investigate combination clinical approach recurrent ankle sprain . Literature analyzed effect combine program include exercise manual therapy acute ankle sprain conclude variety manual therapy technique report pain release improve function . Besides , base effect joint mobilization technique , neurodynamic mobilization could appropriate therapy , due neural distribution fibular nerve ankle joint , study date knowledge include technique part recurrent ankle sprain management . This study aim analyze effect proprioceptive strengthening exercise versus exercise manual therapy recurrent ankle sprain management .</detailed_description>
