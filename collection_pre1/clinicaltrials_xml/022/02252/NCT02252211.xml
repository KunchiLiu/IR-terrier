	<brief_title>Safety Bio-Imaging Trial DS-8895a Patients With Advanced EphA2 Positive Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dose escalation , non-randomized , open label , single site study DS-8895a patient advance metastatic EphA2 positive cancer . Patients receive initial 89Zr trace label infusion DS-8895a , follow safety assessment , PET image pharmacokinetic sample one week period . DS-8895a infused Day 8 , second weekly infusion DS-8895a , two infusion , subsequently occur . The day 36 infusion DS-8895a also trace label 89Zr , subsequent PET image pharmacokinetic sampling . Four dose level ( 1 , 3 , 10 20mg/kg ) evaluate , 3-6 patient enter dose level . Those patient respond stable disease RECIST Day 50 restaging may continue biweekly treatment DS-8895a disease progression , restaging CT scan every 6 week .</detailed_description>
