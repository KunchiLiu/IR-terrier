	<brief_title>The Effect Sugar Sweetened Diet Beverages Consumed Part Weight-Maintenance Diet Fat Storage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excess fat deposition skeletal muscle liver implicate metabolic dysregulation lead type II diabetes . It show daily consumption sugar sweeten beverage lead increase fat mass organ . However , little appreciation give effect overall change weight fat mass applicable dos provide may sugar sweeten beverage typically consume . In addition , recently show sugar suppress hypothalamic activity alter pattern brain connectivity region know involved homeostasis reward aspects food intake . However , observation make large dos sugar commonly consume isolation sugar macronutrients . Foods contain non-caloric sweetener also suggest suppress hypothalamic activity due disconnect perceive sweetness calorie consume . AIM 1 : To investigate response six month daily consumption sugar sweeten diet beverage part weight-stable structured diet whole body fat content , also specifically fat content liver , skeletal muscle abdomen . AIM 2 : To investigate hypothalamic activity acute exposure sugar sweeten diet beverage , whether chronic exposure 6 month induces change hypothalamic activity .</detailed_description>
