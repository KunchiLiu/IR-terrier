	<detailed_description>Protocol Title : Forxiga ( dapagliflozin ) Regulatory Postmarketing Surveillance Department : Korea Medical Objective ( ) : The primary objective study examine safety profile Forxiga Korean patient T2DM . The secondary objective study examine effectiveness profile Forxiga Korean patient T2DM . The exploratory objective study identify factor might associate safety effectiveness profile Forxiga Korean patient T2DM . Study Design : This local , prospective , noninterventional , regulatory postmarketing surveillance study . Adult patient type 2 diabetes mellitus initiate Forxiga indicate Ministry Food Drug Safety ( MFDS ) include . Patients follow minimum 12 week minimum 24 week . Patients treat part routine practice Korean healthcare center accredit physician . In study , patient receive 10 mg 5 mg Forxiga conjunction diet exercise modification treatment T2DM . Study Population : Physicians enroll adult patient diagnose T2DM initiate treatment 10 mg Forxiga , 5 mg Forxiga patient severe hepatic impairment start dose , first time . Data Collection Methods : Astra-Zeneca select medical institution include relevant department , internal medicine family medicine , university hospital , general hospital clinic surveillance drug mainly prescribed staff sufficiently fulfill objective surveillance request surveillance sign write contract . Patients ' medical record data source study . Only laboratory test do part standard care practice data available data collect study . Data Analyses : Statistical analysis explorative descriptive nature . All analysis perform total study population consist patient take least one dose Forxiga . For safety assessment , occurrences adverse event ( AEs ) , serious adverse event , adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) , unexpected adverse drug reaction calculate . Severity , action take surveillance drug , outcome , causal relationship AE study drug analyze . At time regular report final reporting , event count , incidence proportion ( , number patient event divide number patient ) incidence rate ( number patient event divide duration time patient follow study ) adverse event survey re-examination period summarize , 95 % confidence interval present . Changes Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , Post-prandial glucose-2 hour ( 2-hr PPG ) administration Forxiga analyze . At time regular report final reporting , event count effectiveness rate improvement lab result ( HbA1c , FPG , PPG ) , survey re-examination period summarize , 95 % confidence interval present . In order explore factor might influence safety effectiveness profile , cumulative incidence proportion adverse event effectiveness rate analyze patient ' background characteristic Sample Size/Power : In accordance guideline provide MFDS , least 3,000 patient enrol . For overall study population approximately 3000 patient , incidence proportion infrequent adverse event ( example , incidence proportion 0.1 % ) estimate 95 % CI ( 0.02 , 0.29 ) ( n=3 patient event ) . Limitations/Strengths : The surveillance , characteristic noninterventional , observation study , control group follow patient usual clinical practice . Given condition , type safety effectiveness data available collection may limit compare noninterventional clinical trial . This surveillance study generate result wider range data previously derive limited clinical trial set allow longer follow among varied patient population .</detailed_description>
