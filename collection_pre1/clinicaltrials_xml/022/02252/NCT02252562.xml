	<detailed_description>Healthcare-associated infection ( HCAIs ) evolve bacterial resistance major public health concern impact healthcare arena . Further work indicate good understand healthcare issue order effective preventive measure develop . The investigator develop validated experimental model study mechanism , risk factor , implication bacterial cross contamination surgical operating room . The investigator confirm use model intraoperative bacterial transmission event occur frequently within operative case transmission event link 30-day postoperative HCAIs increase patient mortality . In response , investigator implement evaluated various strategy design target risk factor intraoperative bacterial transmission event include anesthesia provider hand hygiene compliance , improve handle design intravascular catheter , improve environmental decontamination high-risk object . While focused strategy successful reduce transmission event incidence 30-day postoperative infection , investigator ' recent work intensive care unit suggest hand hygiene system investigator study could optimize . The investigator propose evaluate effectiveness multimodal hand hygiene system enhance novel wireless technology design facilitate real-time group individual performance feedback , two evidence-based educational intervention , reduce 30-day postoperative HCAIs ( primary outcome ) intraoperative bacterial transmission event , hospital stay duration , hospital re-admission rate ( secondary outcome ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Operating room environments involve adult patient undergo general anesthesia , accord usual practice , elective urgent emergent orthopedic , plastic , neurosurgical , cardiothoracic , urological , general abdominal , gynecological , vascular , ear/nose/and throat surgical procedure 2 . Requirement peripheral and/or central intravenous catheter Surgical inclusion procedure select captured majority 30day postoperative infection prior multicenter study conduct across three major academic medical center [ 3 ] . The investigator [ randomize day order ensure treatment control arm maintain integrity facilitate environment conducive behavior change . ] The investigator anticipate randomization strategy allow equal distribution urgent emergent patient treatment control group . Patients prior infection and/or preexist decolonization include expect equally distribute study group give randomize study design . For HCAI analysis , new infection sit and/or different organism infection consider new HCAI , per NHSN definition ( see ) . The investigator realize decolonization procedure capacity reduce effect size , , appropriately adjust sample size ( see statistical section ) . 1 . Pediatric patient 2 . Lack intravenous catheter 3 . Pregnant 4 . A surgical procedure outside class list 5 . Adjustments day surgery give follow consideration : Provider allergy/intolerance 64 % alcohol : In case primary anesthesia provider conveys prior allergy 64 % alcohol and/or history significant contact dermatitis , operate room exclude enrollment . If primary anesthesia provider develop allergy and/or contact dermatitis study period , document , operate room assign primary anesthesia provider future case exclude . The expectation key provider work operating room randomize intervention participate utilization device . If operating room randomize provider subsequently refuse participate reason , operate room exclude primary analysis include intentiontotreat analysis . An additional operating room randomize occurrence .</criteria>
