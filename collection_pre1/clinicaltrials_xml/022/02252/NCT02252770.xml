	<brief_summary>This study involve dietary supplement . Patients argininosuccinic aciduria randomly assign receive either nitric oxide dietary supplement placebo 2 week , crossed-over receive treatment two week . The investigator expect see : 1 ) Patients ASA decrease ability artery dilate due nitric oxide deficiency , 2 ) Treatment ASA nitric oxide supplement improve ability artery dilate , 3 ) Through test subject ' fibroblast ( cell connective tissue produce collagen fiber ) , investigator hope predict patient may respond NO supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator perform double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover study NO supplementation ASA patient assess endothelial function blood pressure primary endpoint , marker nitric oxide production exploratory endpoint . Subjects receive nitrite-restricted diet prior start trial period . The dietary protein prescription alter . After screen , informed consent , subject undergo study procedure Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) Texas Children 's Hospital , Houston , TX . Safety laboratories perform . Fibroblast lymphoblast culture establish subsequent studies.A baseline assessment vascular endothelial NO production function assess use FMD brachial artery use standard technique ( 1 ) . Subjects randomize receive either dietary nitric oxide supplement placebo 2 week , crossed-over receive treatment two week . The Investigational Pharmacy Services Texas Children 's Hospital assign initial treatment group randomly 1:1 ratio use establish randomization procedure . Following randomization , subject receive either Neo40Â® 40 mg/kg/day two divided dos ) placebo 14 day . This dose dietary supplemental dose well-tolerated investigator proof concept treatment subject well clinical study cardiovascular disease . Subjects return day 14 CRC undergo assessment FMD brachial artery , repeat BP measurement , assay NO status . The subject cross receive alternative treatment study procedure repeat identical fashion initial arm .</detailed_description>
