	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) currently lead cause death worldwide . Epidemiologic study show diet rich plant food protects chronic degenerative disease especially cardiovascular disease . Many study highlight potential role phenolic compound , abundant secondary plant metabolite , provide antioxidant anti-inflammatory property increasingly show important role influence critical cell signal pathway . A less well know , nevertheless rich source polyphenolic compound seaweed . In Ascophyllum nodosum , common brown alga British Isles , polyphenols report comprise 14 % dry weight plant . Some study suggest potential antioxidant anti-inflammatory benefit seaweed-derived polyphenols may yield highly bioactive component commercial potential food pharma application . Preliminary work laboratory reveal potent antioxidant activity Ascophyllum nodosum extract . Therefore , aim randomise , double-blind , placebo control , crossover design study investigate biological activity food grade seaweed polyphenol extract term reduce oxidative damage DNA , modulation inflammatory response reduction chronic , low level inflammation vivo . Apparently healthy volunteer ( age 30-65 year ) randomise receive either capsule contain 100mg seaweed extract match placebo daily 8 week period , 8 week washout period treatment . Fasting blood urine sample take volunteer 4 time-points study , baseline completion 2 treatment phase .</brief_summary>
