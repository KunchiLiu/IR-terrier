	<brief_title>Apixaban Secondary Prevention Thromboembolism Among Patients With AntiphosPholipid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study two primary aim . The first identify patient clinical diagnosis APS describe recruitment , enrollment , screen failure rate , adherence therapy , clinical characteristic , APS diagnostic criterion term broadly accept publish standard . Essential aim capture ability identify , recruit , randomize , retain patient APS receive direct oral anticoagulant . We also report compliance patient satisfaction ; central durable anticoagulation management . The second aim report rate thrombosis ( arterial venous ) death cause thrombosis , well major bleed plus clinically relevant non-major bleed one year among APS patient randomize either warfarin apixaban . As , report rate Thrombosis ( arterial and/or venous ) [ Time Frame : Up 13 month enrollment ] [ Designated safety issue : No ] Major non-major bleed [ Time Frame : Up 13 month enrollment ] [ Designated safety issue : Yes ]</detailed_description>
