	<brief_summary>Despite major advance treatment understanding pathophysiological mechanism , mortality severe sepsis remain high , range 25 50 % . With prevalence &gt; 20 % intensive care unit , population increasingly age many co-morbidities , real public health problem . Thus , change treatment physiological ax could change prognosis patient . Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B ) involve negative regulation many cellular pathway response insulin , leptin certain growth factor endothelial nitric oxide production . PTP1B appear particularly involve control endothelial function insulin secretion . Under condition , encourage result obtain model insulin resistance ( obesity , diabetes ) part pro-angiogenic therapy inhibition PTP1B model heart failure . Recent advance broaden pathophysiological implication PTP1B confer potential role regulation inflammatory process . In experimental model septic shock ( Inserm 1096 ) , investigator demonstrate significant improvement survival cardiovascular function genetically deficient mouse PTP1B ( PTP1B - / - ) . Finally , PTP1B involve downregulation signal pathway insulin via feedback phenomenon . Septic shock induces many change carbohydrate metabolism . These change result hyperglycemia associate insulin resistance , independent risk factor morbidity mortality . Taken together , data suggest expression PTP1B could useful septic patient modulate insulin resistance thus prognosis patient . This justify investigator clinical research project relationship expression PTP1B level , glycemic status prognosis evaluate SOFA score patient septic shock multiple organ failure .</brief_summary>
