	<brief_title>Randomized Boost Versus Boost Irradiation Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize study . Patients stratify participate institution , menopausal status , clinical tumor size , nodal status , presence Ductal Carcinoma In Situ , age , resection margin status . The objective trial ass local recurrence rate cosmetic result woman conservative resection small breast cancer randomly assign postoperative whole-breast irradiation boost vs. 15-16 Gy boost ( patient microscopically complete resection ) 10 Gy vs. 25-26 Gy boost ( patient microscopically incomplete resection ) . Following tumorectomy , patient receive radiotherapy 5 week . Patients microscopically negative resection margin randomize one 2 group : radiotherapy ; radiotherapy boost either external-beam radiotherapy interstitial implant . Patients microscopically positive resection margin also randomize receive either low dose high dose radiotherapy boost external beam interstitial implant . Patients positive lymph node encourage receive least 6 course adjuvant perioperative chemotherapy prior radiotherapy provide radiotherapy initiate within 6 month surgery . All patient begin radiotherapy within 9 week surgery . All postmenopausal woman positive lymph node receive oral tamoxifen daily 2 year .</detailed_description>
