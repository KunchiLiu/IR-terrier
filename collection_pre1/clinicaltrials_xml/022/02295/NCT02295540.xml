	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study well hypofractionated radiation therapy follow surgery work treat patient squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity spread place body . Hypofractionated radiation therapy deliver high dos radiation therapy short period time may kill tumor cell few side effect . Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy surgery may shrink tumor make easy remove , may reduce risk cancer come back , may better treatment squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Followed Surgery Treating Patients With Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . 2 year locoregional control advance oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) treat preoperative hypofractionated radiation follow surgical resection . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Rate pathologic complete response preoperative hypofractionated radiation primary site lymph node ( LN ) . II . Rate radiologic complete partial response ( compute tomography [ CT ] neck intravenous [ IV ] contrast perform radiation therapy , judge per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 criterion ) . III . Grade III/IV/V toxicity short term ( start radiation 60 day surgery ) long term ( 60 day surgery ) . IV . Rate flap complication : Rate flap revision , complete revision require . V. Molecular correlate . VI . Quantitative image correlate . OUTLINE : Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) every day 5 treatment . Patients undergo surgery 7-14 day last radiation treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
