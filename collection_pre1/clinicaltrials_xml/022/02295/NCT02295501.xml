	<detailed_description>The objective Phase 1 safety study provide access potential therapeutic benefit EBOV convalescent plasma contain antibody EBOV . The risk exposure plasma donor may infect transfusion-transmitted pathogen , detectable current license donor test procedure , mitigate use pathogen inactivation minimize risk TTI donor , would otherwise defer ineligible blood donation . The study design prospective , open label , multi-center , single arm study evaluate safety efficacy INTERCEPT plasma prepare EBOV convalescent donor passive immune therapy subject acute EVD . Data collect assess safety intervention monitor adverse event immediate 24-hour post transfusion period . Efficacy assess monitor clinical status treat subject respect clearance EBOV use nucleic acid assay measure pre post treatment viral titer . A number clinical parameter indicative end-organ damage acute EVD monitor determine passive immune therapy affect onset duration renal failure acute lung injury . In addition , blood sample collect pre post transfusion convalescent EBOV INTERCEPT plasma determine biomarkers endothelial injury impact , use guide plasma transfusion therapy establish dose regimen duration treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>EBOV Convalescent Donor Recovered Ebola Virus Disease ( EVD ) clinical criterion declare clinically asymptomatic active EVD . Twentyeight ( 28 ) day hospital discharge . Two negative test result EBOV nucleic acid sensitive nucleic acid test method blood sample draw least 48 hour apart . Plasma/serum test HIV , HTLV , HCV , HBV , syphilis , pathogen ( per institutional practice ) use licensed test method . Inclusion donor positive test result pathogens discretion treat physician , respect relative benefit donor subject convalescent plasma treat INTERCEPT pathogen inactivation , compare risk recipient receive EBOV convalescent plasma transfusion therapy . ABO blood group RhD typing perform donor antiA antiB titer perform . Plasma/serum test human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antibodies female donor history pregnancy donor history transfusion ( per institutional practice ) use licensed test method transfusionrelated acute lung injury ( TRALI ) risk mitigation . Inclusion donor positive test result discretion treat physician , respect relative benefit donor subject convalescent plasma compare risk recipient receive EBOV convalescent plasma transfusion therapy . Measurement antibodies EBOV , feasible ultimately measurement neutralize antibody EBOV , available . Conformity age weight standard blood donor plasma donation . Variance standard may acceptable evaluation treat physician ( ) donor legal guardian consent nonconforming donor collection reduce volume plasma may therapeutic value . Cleared treat physician apheresis plasma donation . Written sign inform consent donate 6501300 mL plasma apheresis frequency twice per week , discretion treat physician . Recipient Subject Acute EVD diagnose nucleic acid test meeting establish case definition ( World Health Organization 2014 ) . Subject legal guardian provide write informed consent receive INTERCEPT plasma . EBOV Convalescent Donor • Active EVD Recipient Subject • Documented food allergy psoralens</criteria>
