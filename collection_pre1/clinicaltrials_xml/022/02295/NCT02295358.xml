	<brief_summary>This study design intention elucidate effect omega-3 fatty acid intraocular pressure ( IOP ) signs/symptoms dry eye . Prior study show statistically significant lower IOP use omega-3 fatty acid perform animal model . This study first attempt replication human model . A limited number study show increase tear production/volume well decrease subjective symptom dry eye , study need well define effect . Better understanding effect supplement intraocular pressure dry eye contribute expand knowledge pathophysiology glaucoma/ocular hypertension dry eye syndrome potentially lead study new potential treatment option condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation Intraocular Pressure &amp; Ocular Surface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research project determine effect omega-3 fatty acid supplementation intraocular pressure ( IOP ) well sign symptom dry eye . We hypothesize dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation associate significant change intraocular pressure compare baseline measurement prior begin supplementation . We hypothesize omega-3 fatty acid supplementation associate significant increase tear production volume well significant change patient ' subjective complaint dry eye .</detailed_description>
