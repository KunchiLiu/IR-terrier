	<detailed_description>The Fernald Medical Monitoring Program ( FMMP ) design provide comprehensive evaluation current health risk future disease collect information subsequent research study meet enrollment criterion FMMP . Purpose FMMP 1 . To provide complete evaluation current health . 2 . To provide comprehensive evaluation risk factor disease , may develop future . 3 . To educate reduce chance develop disease future . 4 . Create epidemiologic database future study . Procedures 1 . Consent participate-The first step process verbally explain potential participant component program , result would receive , future use data biospecimens . Staff witness signature consent form . 2 . Questionnaire- Complete extensive health questionnaire administer year . Data collect include personal characteristic ( age , sex , current address , income , education , marital status , person home ) , current past occupation , family medical history , past address date . SF-36 ( later SF-12 ) health status questionnaire administer question current diet ask . 3 . History Physical Examination physician- A board Certified Physician Internal Medicine , Occupational Medicine , Family Practice perform comprehensive Review Systems Physical examination . 4 . Laboratory Testing- Blood sample obtain series screening test include complete blood count differential , blood sugar , thyroid function test , chemistry liver , kidney cholesterol profile . Men age 49-79 offer PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) year . Urine collect urinalysis ( occult microscopic ) beta2 microglobulin , urine creatine , protein , microalbumin complete first examination , All Laboratory test result house SAS database . 5 . X-ray Examination- All adult offer baseline chest x-ray offered third seventh examination cycle . Chest x-ray offer annually abnormality . Women 40 year age offer screen mammogram year . The complete narrative report procedure enter SAS database . Findings recommendation cod . 6 . Other test - All adult offer baseline electrocardiogram ( EKG ) baseline PFT ( pulmonary function test ) . Those age 45 test occult blood stool examination . 7 . Blood urine sample research- Blood urine sample collect processed 15 aliquot ( 3 whole blood , 3 plasma , 3 serum 3 urine , 3 buffer urine ) freeze -80 freezer use future epidemiologic study . Follow At conclusion examination physician record new medical diagnosis apparent time examination , well diagnostic uncertainty require diagnostic testing . Nurses conduct participant follow phone least six month need test treatment usual primary care practitioner . New diagnosis recognize follow also record medical record . Outside medical record ( usually pathology report ) obtain validate new diagnosis cancer . This procedure use time periodic medical examination offer every three year 1999. every two year 2008 . Ongoing Questionnaires Following initial questionnaire , participant also ask complete yearly questionnaire request information new medical problem recent hospitalization surgery , 77,638 complete questionnaire adult receive program . Yearly questionnaire return rate vary Program year , 2008 44.8 % original enrollee . Yearly questionnaire computer-generated participant miss past questionnaire re-issued critical data item miss questionnaire , greatly improve total ascertainment data item . Continued participation program time re-examination fell 23 % first re-exam adult remain 50 % examination since . ( Some participant skip one exam return next one . ) Only 216 participant withdrawn Program longer contact follow ( except obtain information learn death ) ; 184 participant lose follow-up . Thus , 50 % initial participant continue get semi-annual examination know location vital status 97 % initial participant . Follow time , consider period observation first examination date last questionnaire exam contact , death , program participant , 12.5 year follow-up . Death certificate obtain , NDI search complete , 662 participant die . Background Fernald Medical Monitoring Program The Fernald Medical Monitoring Program ( FMMP ) provide health screening health promotion service result settlement US Department Energy ( DOE ) attorney represent individual ( class member ) live work within five mile Feeds Material Processing Center ( FMPC ) , uranium processing plant Fernald , Ohio . The lawsuit base emotional distress relate primarily potential harmful health effect result environmental release . The settlement also include provision support epidemiological study . This cohort appropriate use study relate radiation uranium exposure . Much cohort never receive uranium exposure beyond background exposure receive general population . Extensive uranium dose reconstruction use method develop CDC demonstrate 60 % cohort minimal exposure uranium radon cumulative ionizing radiation exposure le 3.2 % lifetime background level . For US population , background ionize radiation exposure estimate 3.6 mSv per year 288 mSv lifetime ( 80 Years ) , range individual exposure estimate wide , depend primarily geographic location ( 1-10 mSv per year ) . The maximum estimate yearly exposure beyond background 60 % sub-cohort 5.5 mSv , small compare yearly individual dose variation . Lifetime cumulative exposure FMPC unexposed sub-group range 0.0 0.45 Sv . For 40 % cohort , cumulative lifetime exposure FMPC range ( approximately ) 450 mSv ( 0.45 SV ) 3660 mSv ( 3.66 Sv ) . On January 13 , 2013 Special Master Fernald Settlement Fund enter agreement transfer FMMP database biospecimen collection University Cincinnati purpose maintain database biospecimen collection use epidemiological genetic research . The Fernald Medical Monitoring Program ( FMMP ) become Fernald Community Cohort ( FCC ) . Strengths Program research All diagnose assign ICD-9 code certify medical record coder . All medication information cod type drug use 4-digit code . The extensive coding medical information large cohort provide immediate opportunity ask specific research question . For example , 28,518 mammogram report 27,855 chest x-ray report database literally cod ( cod phrase ) use list 200 3-digit code , specific type imaging . Exposure risk factor metric develop questionnaire information , available database . For example , develop matrix cumulative cigarette pack-years participant , year year program enrollment . We also matrices family history type cancer program participant number first degree total number blood relative type cancer . We collect family structure information participant several different occasion several type question ( family history time initial examination , question else live , question offspring one yearly questionnaire ) . In instance , record name relative cod mention family member FMMP ID , program participant . With questionnaire also ask participant name three personal contact , record relationship program participant . The FMMP database contain information need create family pedigree , note family member Program participant . The extensive information participant FMMP allow selection tailor control group . Criteria control study may differ depend disease lifestyle factor study . For example , FMMP provide Dr. Marshall Anderson set control study identify susceptibility genetic variant relate cigarette smoking lung cancer . For study , control person first degree relative lung cancer , age &gt; 60 year , &gt; 20 pack year cigarette smoke history . Our large cohort extensive database enable u identify need 200 control group without environmental uranium exposure . We conduct similar control selection Dr. Daniel Nebert , search `` highly resistant '' person study susceptibility gene head neck cancer &gt; 80 pack year smoke history history cancer . Persons meet criterion rare population , locate 33 control criterion . The cohort racially diversify , enhances opportunity detect relationship genomic variation disease discover biomarker predictor disease . Since 95 % cohort Whit-non-Hispanic , statistical power genetic study precision data analysis improve lack racial diversity cohort . Although lack generalizability population racial composition certainly limitation , statistical association find population later test racially diverse population . The database excellent resource develop method data mining , potential discovery new statistical association lead hypothesis generation . The extensive database longitudinal cohort provide rich opportunity data mining , develop test new method data mining .</detailed_description>
