	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Program Cognition Brain Overweight/Obese Preadolescent Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New advance neuroelectric neuroimaging technology last year provide golden opportunity explore understand cognition brain function stimulate environmental factor , exercise , particularly study whether physical activity influence brain development early age . The present study , namely ActiveBrains project , aim examine effect 5-months physical exercise program cognition brain , well select physical mental health outcome preadolescents overweight/obese child . A total 100 overweight/obese preadolescent child age 9 10 year randomized exercise group ( N=50 ) control group ( N=50 ) . For practical feasibility reason , study conduct 2 wave , 1st wave sample 30 2nd wave sample 75 . In regard , 15 child intervene within one academic year ( 5-month intervention ) 35 child intervene within follow academic year . The control group receive usual physical education session ( 2 per week ) . In order study extent effect intervention remain disappears formal intervention finish , 3rd evaluation subsample ( 50 participant 1st wave ) 9 month intervention finish . Waitlist control group strategy use , control group also receive after-school exercise program later , assessment effectiveness program complete . Based exist literature , believe 5-months physical exercise program potentially beneficial cognition brain , physical mental health overweight/obese child participate .</detailed_description>
