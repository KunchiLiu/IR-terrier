	<brief_summary>The intent study ass whether cognitive function improve Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms decrease step toward develop objective measure PTSD improvement . The study also evaluate feasibility effectiveness home-based telemental health care ( HBTMH ) compare usual care treatment rural Veterans posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . For assessment-only study , investigator plan assess approximately 200 Veterans total , 150 undergoing regular evidenced-based therapy ( EBT ) PTSD , 50 receive treatment usual ( TAU ) . The 150 veteran EBT group undergo Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) , Cognitive-Behavioral Couple Therapy ( CBCT ) , Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) , Seeking Safety ( SS ) treatment PTSD clinic via home-based telemental health ( HBTMH ) . The study also assess comparison group approximately 50 rural Veterans PTSD diagnose receive treatment usual ( TAU ) ( neither EBT HBTMH ) . The HBTMH patient recruit Office Rural Health ( ORH ) fund project VA Pacific Island Health Care System ( VAPIHCS ) , base National Center PTSD ( NCPTSD ) fund offer 100 rural Veterans mental health treatment home . This research protocol intend assess rural veteran PTSD see within clinic versus refer HBTMH yet ineligible pragmatic purpose , outcome include feasibility , cost-effectiveness , clinical effectiveness . The cognitive change also measure patient PTSD diagnose receive EBT PTSD treatment VA clinic Pacific Islands .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Home-Based Telemental Health Rural Veterans With PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Office Rural Health fund VA Pacific Islands Healthcare System ( VAPIHCS ) provide HBTMH rural veteran diagnose mental health provider PTSD . VAPIHCS serve area size continental United States . Outside Honolulu , mental health specialist serve Veterans PTSD common comorbid disorder , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , pain , insomnia , substance abuse . Moreover , many Veterans difficulty following-up service Community-Based Outpatient Clinics ( CBOCs ) due psychological physical limitation , transportation , work schedule , stigma . Cost another reason develop HBTMH approach . Seventy percent complete course Evidence Based Therapy ( EBT ) significantly improve symptom , long carry diagnosis follow treatment ( Bradley , Greene , Russ , Dutra , &amp; Westen , 2005 ) . However lack access EBTs , especially polytraumas , low chance recovery ( Elhers &amp; Clark , 2008 ; Lyons &amp; Keane , 1992 ) . The lack specialist region mean Veterans continue suffer PTSD related disorder far longer specialized care available . Sending expert area costly , inefficient . The cost difficulty highly rural Veterans travel weekly appointment CBOC lack expertise EBT PTSD treat Veterans polytrauma minimal value . Finally , no-show rate Veterans run well 15 % , whereas research HBTMH no-show rate less 4 % ( http : //conference.avapl.org/pubs/2012 % 20Conference % 20Presentations/HBTMH % 20SOP_Shore_11-12-11 % 20copy.pdf ) To improve service Veterans , VA provide telehealth option CBOC location Pacific Islands . Many patient live far CBOC prefer receive mental health treatment comfort home . HBTMH technology , televideo session home-based patient mental healthcare provider , successfully implement VA ( e.g . throughout VISN 20 VISN 7 ) Department Defense ( DOD ) . VAPIHCS fund ORH provide evidence-based specialty treatment via HBTMH rural Veterans PTSD would otherwise treatment available . The clinical project fund provide 100 rural patient refer CBOC provider specialty clinic HBTMH PTSD treatment . This VAPIHCS clinic provide evidence-based treatment eligible veteran home via televideo clinician currently base NCPTSD . Only ORH-funded VAPIHCS clinical staff provide treatment PTSD patient choose eligible receive home-based telemental health . Veterans eligible VAPIHCS-HBTMH clinic diagnose PTSD license mental health provider CBOC , refer CBOC ( via clinical consult ) . In order initially evaluate effectiveness HBTMH , current research study evaluate veteran participate VAPIHCS-HBTMH clinic compare Treatment Usual ( TAU - refer clinic , however either refused participate type clinical care ineligible part clinic due structural difficulty ( 4G area , ca n't type , lack nearby emergency service , etc ) . Thus , protocol assessment , separate treatment provide rural Veterans . Currently , standardize , objective assessment available determine impairment improvement PTSD . The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment ( DANA ) clinical decision support tool develop Department Defense ( DoD ) field clinic-based neurobehavioral functioning . This neurobehavioral assessment system develop assumption various risk factor ( PTSD , Depression , Insomnia , anger , pain , etc . ) lead significantly slow less accurate ( throughput ) performance cognitive test . The primary goal DANA assist provider determine level function track recovery time . An important purpose study collect longitudinal data patient receive EBT ( clinic HBTMH ) order ass whether cognitive function improves PTSD symptom decrease treatment . This information provide support DANA 's validity objective measure PTSD impairment . The study also plan determine sensitivity specificity DANA neurocognitive measure determine change cognitive functioning within PTSD patient engage EBT time . The propose project aim examine effectiveness empirically base trauma-focused treatment intervention deliver via video conferencing home . This project aim : Objective 1 : Examine feasibility HBTMH compare treatment usual . Objective 2 : Compare effectiveness HBTMH compare treatment usual . Objective 3 : Determine predictor successful treatment outcome ( include treatment completion clinically significant reduction PTSD relate symptom ) . Objective 4 : Determine sensitivity specificity Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment ( DANA ) neurocognitive measure determine change psychological functioning within subject time .</detailed_description>
