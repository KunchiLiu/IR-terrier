	<brief_summary>The investigator plan compare incidence successful placement epidural pain catheter versus paracostal catheter control pain prevention pulmonary complication adult trauma patient blunt chest wall trauma result multiple rib fracture . When trauma patient &gt; = 3 rib fracture side , admit Surgical ICU , encounter within 72 hour time injury , eligible study . If ( proxy ) choose participate , consent obtain randomly assign receive either epidural paracostal catheter pain control . The aim study determine paracostal catheter noninferior epidural control pain multisystem trauma patient . Secondarily investigator evaluate success time placement assign intervention follow patient throughout hospital course compare success analgesia provide modality along complication and/or benefit two type catheter .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>&gt; /= 3 rib fracture single side Admitted Surgical ICU Recruited within 24 hour admission Patient allergy local anesthetic Patient refusal Inability consent reason Prisoners Age &lt; 18 Pregnant woman ( pregnancy screen perform part routine trauma admission lab ) Absolute contraindication either thoracic epidural paracostal pain catheter placement include : 1 . Localized rash skin infection likely site insertion ( We never want translocate infectious material skin epidural space even soft tissue paracostal catheter lay , although flexibility adjust placement ) 2 . Spinal/vertebral instability/fracture include significant vertebral body injury 3 spinous process fracture near level desire epidural placement ( transverse process fracture consider contraindication ) 3 . History extensive back surgery level desire epidural placement 4 . Severe aortic stenosis , mitral stenosis , pulmonary hypertension 5 . Inability correct coagulopathy ( International Normalized Ratio &gt; 1.5 ) 6 . Persistent hemodynamic instability ( hypotension Systolic Blood Pressure &lt; 90 respond initial fluid bolus require ongoing pressor beyond 72 hour window enrollment ) 7 . Inability cooperate participate placement ( intubate sedate , example ) lie correct position placement ( lateral decubitus paracostal pain catheter , either sit lateral decubitus epidural placement ) 8 . Concern elevate intracranial pressure ( imagine patient also intubate )</criteria>
