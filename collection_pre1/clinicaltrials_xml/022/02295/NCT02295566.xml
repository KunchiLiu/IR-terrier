	<brief_summary>The lung patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) become chronically infected bacteria call Pseudomonas aeruginosa childhood . This infection know consist free-living bacteria ( know `` planktonic bacteria '' ) bacteria colony body surface know `` biofilms '' . The bacteria biofilms resistant tolerant antibiotic . Current CF treatment exacerbation aim eradicate control pseudomonal infection use aggressive antibiotic regime . Despite treatment many patient develop chronic infection never clear . Chronic infection cause damage lung . Patients colonise Pseudomonas unwell die young age . Our laboratory establish low dose nitric oxide ( NO ) disrupt pseudomonal biofilms laboratory . This pilot study discover whether non-toxic level NO administer participant episode acute infection ( exacerbation ) disrupt bacteria biofilms increase effectiveness antibiotic therapy . This protocol describe participant-blind randomise control pilot study treatment nitric oxide gas acute infective exacerbation ( also know simply `` acute exacerbation '' ) . Patients CF age 12 asked take part . They randomise receive 7 day either inhale nitric oxide gas placebo alongside standard therapy exacerbation . Sputum sample obtain , treatment period microbiological analysis . The primary endpoint microbiological effect bacterial biofilms NO adjunctive therapy . Secondary microbiological endpoint include group difference pseudomonal colony form unit ( CFUâ€Ÿs ) , biofilm NO level detail characterisation biofilms treatment . Secondary clinical endpoint include lung function well-established indicator quality life . The aim randomise pilot study proof concept guide design large multi-centre trial definitively evaluate effectiveness NO NO donor adjunctive therapy CF .</brief_summary>
