There increase evidence rehabilitation intervention involve exercise extend beyond sub acute phase even later stage care positive impact various functional ability . The purpose study determine exercise program training people suffer fall-related hip fracture improve functional mobility compare usual care . Randomized control trial use blinded assessor intention-to-treat analysis . We recruit 82 old adult , 60 year suffer hip fracture due fall complete physiotherapy and/or rehabilitation . These participant later stage rehabilitation phase ( 6 month 2 year fracture ) .

	<detailed_description>Over lifetime , half woman quarter men suffer fragility bone fracture [ 1 , 2 ] , mostly due fall [ 2 ] . Among serious common fracture hip fracture , reach significant level mortality [ 2 ] disability [ 3 ] . Hip fracture increasingly important problem internationally , particularly develop country , due growth number older people . It estimate 2050 global number hip fracture 7.3 21.3 million [ 4 ] cost treatment approximately 131.5 billion dollar [ 5 ] , due population increase . Physical psychological limitation post-fracture , decrease mobility [ 6 ] muscle strength lower limb [ 7 ] , deficit balance [ 6 ] , lack trust [ 7 ] , fear fall [ 6 ] increase risk fall [ 8 ] , hamper around 40 % old people return daily activity live independently safely [ 3 , 9 ] . Even two year injury , half elderly regain functional level prior injury [ 10 ] , persist moderate high risk fall [ 6 ] . Risk fall future fall population may due either physical limitation [ 11 , 12 ] ( due insufficient recovery balance , muscle strength consequently mobility ) fact already suffer fracture previously [ 13 ] , increase chance new fracture population [ 14 ] . There consensus best intervention functionality elderly hip fracture . However , recently different exercise program suggest improve mobility patient [ 8 ] . Some study show effectiveness rehabilitation program period 6 month injury [ 15-18 ] . Although , study explore late period rehabilitation ( 6 month ) [ 19 , 20 ] , functional limitation persist due inadequate dose well type exercise perform . Population Brazil grow age one fast rate world even great come decade . The number senior double 2002 2020 , 15 million 32 million reach 64 million 2050 ( 30 % total population Brazil ) [ 21 ] . Furthermore , elderly age 80 increase exponentially next four decade , put grow disproportionate demand health system social support [ 21 ] . The purpose study determine exercise program training people suffer fall-related hip fracture improve functional mobility compare usual care .</detailed_description>
