	<brief_summary>Sleep disordered breathing ; specifically obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) disease affect 8-12 % general population often 70 % bariatric surgical population . OSA characterize repetitive collapse upper airway , cause reduction cessation airflow decrease oxygen saturation . These event resolve arousal sleep , reduce sleep quality lead excessive daytime sleepiness . An in-laboratory polysomnography ( PSG ) gold standard diagnosis OSA . Previous study establish obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) potential independent risk factor postoperative complication , adverse surgical outcome , long hospital stay . Patients OSA increase postoperative complication , frequent oxygen desaturation , postoperative atelectasis increase postoperative pain . Despite clear risk , OSA remain diagnosed estimate 25-30 % patient high risk OSA . It suggest OSA event may even frequent post operatively residual effect anesthesia use potent pain medication opioids . Postoperatively apneas often go undetected untreated . The use supplemental O2 may mask desaturations convenient technology noninvasively monitor ventilation detect apnea hypopnea post-surgical patient . New advance technology digital signal processing lead development impedance base Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) . The RVM ( ExSpiron™ , Respiratory Motion , Inc. ; Waltham , MA ) show provide accurate real-time , continuous , non-invasive measurement tidal volume ( TV ) , minute ventilation ( MV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) . Our main hypothesis non-invasive , impedance-based RVM monitor accurately reflect TV , RR MV sleep detect apnea hypopneas accurately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational pilot study evaluate clinical applicability ExSpiron Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) patient suspect sleep apnea . Previous work demonstrate ability RVM provide non-invasive , real-time , continuous measurement respiratory parameter ( MV , TV , RR ) study specifically look patient sleep patient sleep disordered breathing . Previously device capable providing , continuous , non-invasive , real time measurement ventilatory status minute ventilation , tidal volume RR . The ExSpiron system utilize impedance base technology proprietary algorithm ( Respiratory Motion Inc. , Waltham , MA ) develop obtain measurement . Respiratory Motion , Inc. previously evaluate ExSpiron measurement respiratory parameter ( MV , TV RR ) study adult volunteer subject . Stimulus lead deliver alternate minimal current ( 1.5 mA ) frequency 50 kHz record lead record differential voltage calculate impedance . Subject data ( height , weight , age , gender , chest circumference ) measure . The study show use optimal lead placement configuration , algorithm base chest wall impedance respiratory pattern analysis provide provided RVM measurement ExSpiron curve correlate strongly spirometry volume spirometry curve . A large percentage patient general surgical population undiagnosed OSA . This population increase risk adverse perioperative respiratory complication . Assessment management perioperative respiratory function early intervention indicate multifaceted , complex task often complicate unavailability accurate continuous monitoring system demonstrate apnea hypopnea guide clinical decision making . The ExSpiron system design patient intend address limitation current generation hospital monitor list : In , non-ventilated patient , current monitoring device provide objective non-invasive , continuous real time measurement important respiratory parameter MV , TV RR reflect respiratory competence , provide adequate assessment apnea hypopnea . Current monitoring non-intubated patient mostly rely oximetry data , subjective clinical assessment measure respiration ventilation rarely transcutaneous CO2 measurement . In appropriate clinical setting , ExSpiron system provide direct quantitative measure ventilation ( MV , TV RR ) use detection apnea hypopnea . Precise apnea hypopnea assessment . Most gaps leave current respiratory assessment technology may fill non-invasive monitor one propose use study . There many potential application technology include : use peri-procedural environment evaluate effect medication ventilation detection apnea/hypopnea . In addition , may useful clinical decision make regard medication adjustment pain management protocol , evaluation ventilatory status prior extubation evaluation need reintubation , also trend respiratory pattern avoid risky emergency airway management intervention . New advance technology digital signal processing lead development impedance base Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) . The RVM ( ExSpiron™ , Respiratory Motion , Inc. ; Waltham , MA ) show provide accurate real-time , continuous , non-invasive measurement tidal volume ( TV ) , minute ventilation ( MV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) . Our main hypothesis non-invasive , impedance-based RVM monitor accurately reflect TV , RR MV sleep detect apnea hypopneas accurately . Main Hypothesis : The ExSpiron monitor accurately reflect apnea hypopnea event compare standard polysomnography . The ExSpiron monitor able distinguish central obstructive apneic event . Secondary Hypothesis : 1 ) Correlation MV % compare % predicted comorbidities ( e.g . hypertension metabolic syndrome ) , 2 ) Correlation MV change compare MV % predict oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) , 3 ) evaluation breathe pattern obstruction , 4 ) evaluation breathe pattern different type apnea ( central , obstructive mixed ) .</detailed_description>
