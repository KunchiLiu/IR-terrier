	<brief_summary>The aim study use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) investigate efficacy Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilation ( SeQuent Please ) SB drug elute stent ( EXCEL stent ) deployment main branch ( reference diameter : ≥ 2.5 mm ≤ 4.0 mm , reference diameter side branch : ≥ 2.0 mm ≤ 3.5 mm , length stenosis either branch ≤ 30 mm ) treatment significant ( &gt; 70 % ) de-novo-bifurcation stenosis Medina classification type native coronary artery reflect procedural success evaluate preservation vessel patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Catheter intervention coronary lesion involve bifurcation 15-20 % . The treatment bifurcation lesion usually difficult compare non-bifurcation lesion complication rate high . Possible complication acute SB closure ( BBC one ) high rate restenosis stent thrombosis . Carina shift stenting , double triple layer stent , stent distortion different tissue distribution may reason . The use drug-eluding stent treatment bifurcation lesion suggest DES reduces rate restenosis int main branch ( 5-10 % ) ; however , result side branch optimal . Current interventional treatment bifurcation lesion consist implant DES MB POBA provisional T-stenting SB . Drug elute Balloon new option improvement field coronary angioplasty . Clinically proven , offer completely new procedural option treat vascular stenosis since drug elution require stent platform . Since SB rarely stented , DEB could particularly helpful reduce restenosis rate SB lesion . PEPCAD V trial prove Percutaneous treatment bifurcation lesion drug-eluting balloon result procedural success 100 % . Follow-up angiography nine month show DES-like result MB SB . In PEPCAD V trial，the MB dilate DEB . Next , BMS ( CoroflexR , B. Braun Melsungen AG , Germany ) implant MB . While procedure complex , whether put drug elute stent MB directly overlap drug delivery harmful . OCT system axial resolution 20 microm transverse resolution 30 microm . OCT able penetrate image near-occlusive coronary plaque . Therefore , prudent use OCT investigate efficacy Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilation ( SeQuent Please ) SB drug elute stent ( EXCEL stent ) deployment main branch ( reference diameter : ≥ 2.5 mm ≤ 4.0 mm , reference diameter side branch : ≥ 2.0 mm ≤ 3.5 mm , length stenosis either branch ≤ 30 mm ) treatment significant ( &gt; 70 % ) de-novo-bifurcation stenosis Medina classification type native coronary artery reflect procedural success evaluate preservation vessel patency .</detailed_description>
