	<brief_summary>In Fiji , cervical cancer second frequent cancer high cause cancer mortality woman . In 2008/9 , Ministry Health Fiji accept donation 110,000 dos quadrivalent HPV vaccine , Gardasil® base high cervical cancer disease burden . There enough vaccine vaccinate girl age 9-12 year ( 30,338 girl ) three-dose schedule , girl receive three dos vaccine . This mean girl receive reduced dos may fully protect HPV genotype present Gardasil® . While HPV vaccine highly immunogenic efficacious license three-dose schedule , limited information effectiveness reduce dose schedule term immunogenicity memory . There grow evidence study two dos HPV vaccine may sufficient protection . Reduced schedule would benefit Fiji due improve cost logistics . This study examine whether one two dos HPV vaccine provide similar immunological evidence long-term protection standard three-dose schedule term antibody titres genotype present Gardasil® . To compare immunological memory response dosage group , dose Cervarix ® administer girl magnitude memory response measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 2008/9 , Ministry Health ( MoH ) Fiji accept donation 110,000 dos quadrivalent HPV vaccine , Gardasil® base high cervical cancer disease burden . There enough vaccine vaccinate girl age 9-12 year ( 30,338 girl ) three-dose schedule , girl receive three dos vaccine . This mean girl receive reduced dos may fully protect HPV genotype present Gardasil® . In 2013 , Fiji MoH Australian Aid support introduce Cervarix ® vaccine three dose schedule ( 0 , 1 , 6 month ) give girl last year primary school part national immunisation program . This unique opportunity determine few three dos Gardasil® vaccine immunologically similar standard three-dose schedule 6 year receive vaccine ( ie indicate long-term protection ) . This open label Phase II/III clinical trial girl ( age 14-17 year ) previously receive zero , one , two three dos Gardasil® 2008/9 . A dose Cervarix ® administer girl study immunological evidence long-term protection term antibody level ( include neutralisation titre ) , number memory B T cell ( include cytokine response ) gene expression profile measure . A non-random sample 200 girl recruit ; girl previously receive one , two three dos Gardasil® identify school vaccination list obtain MoH Ministry Education ; girl receive vaccine previously recruit via recommendation friend girl informal network . The investigator aim approximately 50 % indigenous Fijian ( i-Taukei ) /others 50 % Fijians Indian descent study . Informed consent obtain parent/guardian participant participant , well check participant 's eligibility study nurse . Twenty-five milliliter ( mL ) blood total drawn participant 28 day dose Cervarix® vaccine . To ensure participant receive three dos HPV vaccine end study , follow appointment make study participant receive off-study vaccine receive HPV vaccine previously receive one dose Gardasil® 2008/9 campaign ; sample collect follow-up appointment . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) plasma separate blood , freeze liquid nitrogen -80 degree freezer laboratory analysis , respectively . Sample size : The primary outcome comparison geometric mean concentration ( GMCs ) HPV- specific antibody response ( include neutralisation titre ) HPV 6 , -11 , -16 -18 , group previously receive zero , one , two three dos Gardasil® . Based publish data 5 year follow-up study ( Olsson et al . 2007 ) , standard deviation anti-HPV antibody 570 ( HPV16 ) 84 ( HPV18 ) . The sample size require provide 80 % power detect 30 % difference HPV antibody range 48/group ( HPV16 ) 49/group ( HPV18 ) . A sample size 50/group use study . Statistical Analysis Plan : Comparison GMCs anti-HPV antibody level neutralise antibody level compare use log-transformed data use Student 's t-test . The proportion seropositivity compare use Fisher 's exact test . These analysis also use compare anti-HPV antibody level neutralise antibody level one month post Cervarix® . Comparison B- T- cell frequency do use Mann-Whitney U test . For cytokine secretion PBMC supernatant , comparison GMCs ± 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) do log-transformed data use Student 's t-test . The gene expression profile ( tumour necrosis factor-α , interleukin ( IL ) - 6 , IL-8 , interferon-γ , IL-18 IL-1β ) different group compare use paired student test . The fold increase decrease gene expression assess use sign test . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant analysis . Data Collection : Each child unique study number folder collate field site study case report form ( CRFs ) . All laboratory process undertaken blinded fashion use de-identified sample . Field clinical data enter study office train study staff use EpiData software send Drs Russell Licciardi analysis . The design computer databases data clean do study staff supervision principal investigator . Only designate study staff investigator associate project access data . Data analyse help staff Clinical Epidemiology Biostatistics Unit ( CEBU ) , Murdoch Childrens Research Institute ( MCRI ) . Data Storage : All laboratory data collect study store electronically hard copy format secure lockable filing cabinet 15 year completion study . Study Record Retention : The biological sample store Immunology Laboratory MCRI 15 year follow completion study , accordance ethic requirement clinical trial . The sample destroy participant consent blood sample use ethic approve HPV related study . If participant consent blood sample use future ethically approve research , relate study , sample keep indefinitely MCRI , Melbourne , Australia . Additional ethic approval require investigator wish use future use sample later HPV related study . All consent form file proper folder secure lockable file cabinet on-site Fiji 15 year follow completion study . The consent form shred disposed locked security bin . All participate investigator research staff maintain subject confidentiality . Except consent form , participant identify unique study number throughout study . This extend clinical information , test biological sample , documentation , laboratory database . Parents/guardians reimburse time travel sample collection . MCRI Fiji MoH sign Memorandum Understanding ( MoU ) . A Research Specific Agreement develop Fiji MoH MCRI include intellectual property publication clause . The agreement develop unreasonably delay publication result study , harm prejudice outcome research program interest party intellectual property , either develop pursuant research program own party .</detailed_description>
