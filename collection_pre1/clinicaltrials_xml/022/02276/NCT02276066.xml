	<brief_summary>This study investigate mechanism kidney dysfunction perpetuate inflammation , immunosuppression , catabolism ( PICS ) chronic critical illness . The investigator test hypothesis persistent kidney dysfunction sepsis associate chronic critical illness contributes decrease survival development PICS . In chronic critical illness , persistence inflammatory state may lead capillary rarefication kidney cause accelerate chronic kidney disease . Progression chronic kidney disease chronic critical illness drive PICS . Indeed , many feature chronic critical illness consistent protein-energy malnutrition muscle waste associate chronic kidney disease . Thus , kidney play contributory role chronic critical illness PICS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal project measure kidney filtration function day 14 day discharge hospital ( whichever occurs first ) , order determine presence magnitude persistent kidney dysfunction sepsis episode longitudinally assess decline kidney function one year follow-up . The measure glomerular filtration rate ( GRF ) patient chronic critical illness control ( sepsis patient discharge ICU day 14 ) use determine degree kidney dysfunction contributes decrease survival increase chronic kidney disease year one sepsis onset . One and/or three way GFR assessment use , approximately day 14 approximately day discharge ICU one year follow : 1 . Determine clearance Iohexol blood Iohexol injection and/or 2 . Determine apperance Iohexol urine Iohexol injection ( would injection one , would require two injection ) and/or 3 . A timed urine collection determine clearance urea creatinine and/or 4 . Estimated GFR use calculation serum creatinine cystatin C , This provide opportunity validate different measurement .</detailed_description>
