	<detailed_description>In small , well-characterized sample prescription opioid abuser ( POAs ) chronic pain buprenorphine therapy , supplement study investigate utility feasibility two novel tracer compound , combination standard marker ( riboflavin ) , monitor adherence study drug prescription parent clinical trial ( NCT01821430 ) . 1 . We examine ability two benign ( dos use ) medication , quinine ( 80mg ) acetazolamide ( 15mg ) serve valid reliable marker medication use . The relative utility describe use study medication ( PGB 400mg/day ) , drug dependent primarily renal excretion . In PGB acetazolamide eliminate unchanged urine , examine latter use without alter elimination rate former , whether maker hepatic renal mode elimination ( quinine ) would serve good indicator adherence trial . 2 . Being standard clinical trial , medication adherence marker riboflavin use parent study ( NCT01821430 ) , readily detect urine sample simple visual inspection . However , riboflavin relatively gross indicator medication use ; reside body time period typically required outpatient trial , affect dietary riboflavin variable absorption . Capitalizing riboflavin 's ease detection , second aim supplement examine whether riboflavin combine one new candidate tracer , provide superior indicator adherence , riboflavin qualitatively observe immediately , tracer quantitatively detect subsequent urine toxicology analysis . The cross design study allow u address aim efficient straightforward manner . Following examination pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PGB alone , 's PK reexamine compounded acetazolamide , acetazolamide riboflavin present . Next , short washout period , study PGB PK repeat acetazolamide replace quinine . If new tracer interfere PK PGB , one chosen formulate ( along riboflavin ) PGB use parent study , thereby provide qualitative quantitative indicator adherence .</detailed_description>
