	<brief_summary>Testicular cancer ( TC ) rare disease , mostly affect young men age 15-35 year . Their life expectancy greatly improve due introduction platinum-containing chemotherapy disseminate TC late 1970s . Given good prognosis TC nowadays , prevention early detection late adverse effect TC treatment become increasingly important . Current literature suggest TC treatment , specifically exposure platinum agent , associate increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The precise role treatment component like platinum pathogenesis cardiometabolic change cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) warrant investigation , since know CVD develop direct platinum-induced damage vascular wall mediation development cardiometabolic riskfactors . The aim study identify risk factor development CVD treatment TC . A profound insight pathophysiologic mechanism identification risk factor CVDs need facilitate development preventive strategy optimize survivorship care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TACkLE Study - Tackling Adverse Chemotherapy-associated Late Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : The investigator perform multicenter case-cohort study . Patients treat TC develop cardiac disease ( ( either myocardial infarction , proven coronary artery disease ( grade ≥2 ) congestive heart failure ( grade ≥2 ) ) invite ( former ) treat oncologist participate study ( case ) . Furthermore , hospital random sample 15 % total population treat TC invite ( subcohort ) . The investigator collect detailed diagnostic- treatment data TC ( risk factor ) CVD case well subcohort member . All case subcohort member approach complete questionnaire donate blood sample DNA analysis , write informed consent . Patients young 40 year TC diagnosis young 75 year moment study contact ask participate cardiometabolic risk inventory sub study . For , participant undergo basic study assessment consist physical examination , venapuncture hand morning urine sample . This assessment perform participate hospital , general practitioner home visit member investigator research team . Additional ( non-invasive ) cardiovascular function measurement ( IMT AGEs ) perform UMCG .</detailed_description>
