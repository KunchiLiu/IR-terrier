	<brief_summary>Patients receive standardize high-protein test meal breakfast time . Insulin give bolus ( normal dual-wave ( normal plus square ) basal rate use insulin pump . The 3h post-meal glucose excursion record self-blood glucose measurement ( SMBG ) ( every 1 hour ) continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) . The intervention take part in-patient clinical condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normal Versus Dual Wave Insulin Bolus High-protein Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dual-wave bolus delivers immediate normal pre-meal insulin bolus follow square-wave bolus evenly deliver several hour program patient . The aim study compare post-prandial glycaemic excursion follow high-protein meal administration insulin normal vs dual-wave bolus . During prospective , cross-over , repeated measure study , pediatric patient type 1 diabetes , treat insulin pump therapy evaluate use self-blood glucose measurement follow standardized high-protein meal two type bolus ( normal dual-wave ) . The required insulin dose calculate base patient 's insulin-exchange ratio . A high-protein meal give two subsequent breakfast comparison make normal dual-wave insulin bolus delivery . Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic excursion identify use CGMS .</detailed_description>
