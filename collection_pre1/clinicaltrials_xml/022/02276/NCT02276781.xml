	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize among people low extremity peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) , biomarker level high time period immediately precede acute coronary event compare time period immediately precede acute coronary event . Biomarkers investigator study CRP , SAA , D-dimer . Biomarkers measure baseline every two month follow-up . The primary aim study follow . Specific Aim # 1 . Among participant PAD experience acute coronary event follow-up , investigator determine whether biomarker level measure immediately prior coronary event high level immediately precede coronary event . Specific Aim # 2 , Part 1 . The investigator determine whether participant experience coronary event ( case ) high biomarker level visit immediately prior event participant experience coronary event ( control ) time case event . Specific Aim # 2 , Part 2 . The investigator determine whether participant experience coronary event ( case ) great increase biomarkers time period lead event compare participant experience coronary event ( control ) . To achieve aim , investigator enroll 650 participant PAD follow prospectively , measure blood sample every two month , ascertain presence acute coronary event every two month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Peripheral arterial disease define ABI le equal 0.90 either leg We also include PAD patient ABI &gt; 0.90 meet follow criterion : History document low extremity revascularization . A write report medical record require documentation An angiogram demonstrate &gt; 50 % stenosis one low extremity artery . Again , write report require document . Participants angiogram note moderate great stenosis also consider eligible , specific amount stenosis denote A report noninvasive vascular laboratory demonstrate toe brachial pressure less 0.60 . Other criterion ( i.e . PVR data ) noninvasive vascular laboratory consider sufficient inclusion Treatment cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer previous 2 year . ( However , person treat noninvasive breast cancer prostate cancer previous year potentially eligible physician indicate life expectancy &gt; 24 month , since noninvasive breast prostate cancer often excellent prognosis ) Unintentional weight loss &gt; 7.5 pound last six month ; MiniMental Status Exam ( MMSE ) score &lt; 23 30 history cognitive impairment Communication difficulty due language barrier Refusal regular blood draw inability obtain blood sample baseline Coronary cerebrovascular event previous six month ( person may become eligible late date ) History inflammatory arthritis ( rheumatoid arthritis , lupus erythematosis , polymyalgia rheumatic , gout ) , however participant gouty arthritis eligible last episode three month ago Residence 40 mile away medical center unwillingness travel medical center every two month blood collection Unable return follow test &gt; consecutive six month period next two year Heart transplant surgery Major surgery ( one require general anesthesia ) within past 3 month These person may become eligible late date</criteria>
