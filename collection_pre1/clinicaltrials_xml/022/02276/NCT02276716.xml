	<brief_summary>Familial dysautonomia ( FD ) devastate hereditary disease development selective neuronal population impaired deficiency protein IKAP ( Slaugenhaupt , 2002 ) . There known cure . Treatments supportive , often ineffective around half patient die reach age 40 ( Axelrod et al. , 2002 ) . Phosphatidylserine FDA approve food supplement show recently correct genetic abnormality restore IKAP protein level cell line derive patient FD ( Keren et al. , 2011 ) humanize mouse model disease ( Bochner et al. , 2013 ) . Despite safety efficacy fragile population unknown , many patient FD currently take phosphatidylserine The investigator propose conduct safety , tolerability early proof concept efficacy study phosphatidylserine patient FD . The study divide two independent arm . The first phase study open-label dose titration study determine safety optimal dose phosphatidylserine effect normal IKBKAP mRNA level 40 patient FD . The second phase longitudinal observational study follow , yearly basis , patient FD age opt take phosphatidylserine . In study , evaluate long-term safety phosphatidylserine patient FD hope determine whether phosphatidylserine impact clinical evolution disorder . Our long-term goal find effective therapy improve quality life patient FD alter disease prognosis . We believe promise phosphatidylserine availability health food shop warrant control safety , tolerability efficacy study determine whether take patient FD . This study intend determine whether phosphatidylserine new indication treat FD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Nutritional Supplement Phosphatidylserine Patients With Familial Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial dysautonomia ( FD ) autosomal recessive disease cause mutation I-B kinase complex associate protein ( IKBKAP ) gene sequence ( Anderson et al. , 2001 ; Slaugenhaupt et al. , 2001 ) . The disorder affect development sensory nerve , result impaired pain temperature perception ( Riley et al. , 1949 ) , lack visceral sensation ( Norcliffe-Kaufmann et al. , 2010 ) , dysphagia proprioceptive gait ataxia ( Macefield et al. , 2011 ) . Childhood mortality increase , aspiration pneumonia lead cause death . In early adulthood , renal failure common ( Pearson et al. , 1980 ) eyesight deteriorates due optic atrophy gait ataxia worsen make walk impossible without assistance . The incidence seizure , scoliosis , respiratory insufficiency , sleep apnea gastrointestinal bleeds increase . Sudden unexpected cardiac death common increase incidence cancer . Current treatment supportive frequently ineffective . FD known cure 50 % patient die age 40 . A decade ago , discover disease cause point mutation IKBKAP gene , leading deficiency I-B kinase complex associate protein ( IKAP ) mainly neuronal tissue ( Slaugenhaupt et al. , 2001 ; Mezey et al. , 2003 ; Lee et al. , 2009 ) . Phosphatidylserine , FDA-approved food supplement , show increase protein level FD-derived cell line ( Keren et al. , 2011 ) well mouse model FD ( Bochner et al. , 2013 ) . Because severity FD , availability phosphatidylserine health food store promise treatment , many patient FD already take , although safety efficacy population unknown . Thus , propose control study phosphatidylserine determine safety profile whether impact natural history FD . SPECIFIC AIM 1 : It know phosphatidylserine increase level IKBKAP mRNA patient FD . To determine optimal dose phosphatidylserine patient FD , ( i.e. , low dosage maximal improvement IKBKAP mRNA production without significant side effect ) monitor safety efficacy phosphatidylserine open-label dose escalation study . Safety parameter IKBKAP mRNA level blood measure 40 patient FD baseline repeat increase dos phosphatidylserine . SPECIFIC AIM 2 : In independent long-term observational study , follow patient FD age opt take phosphatidylserine food supplement diet . Safety parameter measure part routine evaluation annual basis . The long-term efficacy phosphatidylserine determine evaluate evolution standard parameter neurological function overtime patient receive phosphatidylserine compare progression historical control database archive .</detailed_description>
