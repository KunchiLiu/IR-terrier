	<brief_summary>This study design investigate ability pleth variability index ( PVI ) non-invasively predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilated child . Patients undergo atrial septal defect ( ASD ) repair cardiac catheterization suite recruit study . These patient ideal candidate deviation make standard clinical practice . All patient already general anesthesia , mechanically ventilate , monitor pulse oximetry , provide intravenous fluid compensate nil per o ( NPO ) fluid deficit . The deviation clinical practice include abbreviate echocardiographic exam , application Masimo pulse oximeter , measurement CO via thermodilution catheter interventional cardiologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Investigation Pleth Variability Index ( PVI ) Dynamic Parameter Fluid Responsiveness Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Hypovolemia frequent cause circulatory failure anesthetize critically ill child . Fluid boluses first line treatment aim optimize stroke volume ultimately improve oxygen delivery . A patient whose stroke volume significantly increase result fluid bolus deem 'fluid responsive ' . Traditional parameter circulatory status ( e.g . blood pressure , heart rate , central venous pressure ) show ineffective predicting fluid responsiveness . Dynamic parameter fluid responsiveness , pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) , reflect hemodynamic change secondary intermittent positive pressure ventilation . These index proven superior traditional static measure circulatory status predict fluid responsiveness . Furthermore , use dynamic parameter goal-directed fashion show improve outcome high risk , adult surgical patient . As , increase interest use dynamic parameter guide fluid resuscitation mechanically ventilate infant child . Unfortunately , paucity literature examine validity dynamic parameter child . The need arterial vascular access , less common small child , also limited ability investigate parameter . Recently , non-invasive dynamic parameter develop examine plethysmographic waveform pulse oximeter . The pleth variability index ( PVI ) represent dynamic change hemodynamic performance occur respiratory cycle . Studies PVI adult show reliable predictor fluid responsiveness . However , conclusive data child lack . Hypothesis : This study design investigate ability PVI non-invasively predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilated child . The hypothesis high PVI predict significant stroke volume increase response fluid bolus mechanically ventilated child . Methods : The study population consist 20 child undergoing cardiac catheterization normal ( non-shunted ) physiology conclusion procedure , age 1-12 year . All subject receive PVI measurement well stroke volume measurement via transthoracic echocardiography . Subsequent volume expansion achieve intravenous bolus 10 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid ( normal saline ) administer 10 minute . After completion bolus , additional PVI measurement stroke volume measurement obtain . Significance : Hypovolemia significant cause harm anesthetize critically ill infant child . In order successfully resuscitate patient , must gain good understand optimize cardiac output oxygen delivery . A non-invasive monitor indicate stroke volume responsiveness potential good guide fluid resuscitation improve outcome .</detailed_description>
