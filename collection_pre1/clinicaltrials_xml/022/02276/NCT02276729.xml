	<brief_title>Mirror Box Therapy Upper Limb Function With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Stroke major cause mortality United Kingdom around 111,000 people per year newly diagnose . Of survivor , 50 % leave significant , long-term effect include residual deficit upper limb . Rehabilitation upper limb impairment rest OT play vital role enable stroke patient self-manage condition live optimally independent life . Mirror box therapy ( MBT ) relatively new therapeutic intervention gain recognition within OT potential offer rehabilitation upper limb function stroke patient . Based upon mirror visual feedback originally use treatment phantom limb pain amputation , neural recovery brain stimulate use mirrored movement non-affected upper limb . It think visual feedback help recruit dormant motor pathway replace damage pathway encourage return movement , thus mirror box therapy think improve upper limb function movement mental stimulation . However , exist study limit due non- consistent participant post-stroke delay ( range 3-12 month ) . Few study include patient sub- acute period post stroke ( 0-3 month ) , population consider likely benefit therapy early recovery stage . Aims Objectives . The aim pilot study therefore explore feasibility conduct fully power randomize control trial mirror box therapy upper limb rehabilitation within sub-acute stroke population . The objective study : 1 . Evaluate feasibility patient recruitment within in-patient sub-acute single setting ; 2 . Assess feasibility deliver MBT component OT treatment sub-acute in-patient population ; 3 . Evaluate sensitivity outcome measure use fully power trial conduct power calculation ; 4 . Conduct preliminary analysis data identify potential treatment gain within 2 group ; 5 . Pilot collection data enable cost-consequence analysis undertaken output main RCT . Sample : 50 participant recruit randomized two group ( treatment n=25 ; control n=25 ) 2 year period 1 January 2015 - 31st Dec 2016 . Sample Size Justification : This sample size allow u estimate standard deviation primary outcome , allow u estimate participation rate precision +/-12.5 % , expect , rate vicinity 75 % . Randomization : Block randomization undertaken use computer generate randomization list . Each block estimate run 16 week period . This allow recruitment 1-2 new subject per week assumes average inpatient stay 6 week . Group allocation conceal consecutively number , opaque seal envelope . Intervention : Participants group shall receive standard OT treatment upper limb rehabilitation duration in-patient stay , 3-5 session per week approximately 45 minute duration . This classic rehabilitation treatment base upon neurodevelopmental theory use Bobath approach postural control repetitive task training . Participants treatment group additionally require perform two 20-minute session mirror box therapy , five days/week duration in-patient stay . Also base upon neurodevelopmental theory , treatment create illusion perfect bilateral synchronization repetitive task training conceal affected arm mirror box reflect repetitive upper arm movement conduct unaffected limb . Control Group Intervention : Participants receive standard Occupational Therapy intervention population sub-acute rehabilitation setting , deliver member OT stroke team . This follow document protocol use within Health Social Care Trust progress 8 phase assist unassisted movement , gross upper limb movement wrist fine finger movement , use remedial functional activity well ward-level rehabilitation . Treatment Group : Participants intervention group require perform two 20 minute session MBT , five days/week duration in-patient stay carry direction member OT stroke team . Sessions conduct patient 's bedside OT Department . Participants seat comfortable high chair position front adjustable height table . The mirror box position table front participant . The participant place assist therapist place affect arm open end section nylon box ; mirror section face patient 's non affect side . Follow-up data period : We follow initial block 3 6 monthly interval order collect long term data use sustain functional gain well use economic analysis . We attempt follow many subject possible latter block 3 &amp; 6 monthly interval . Analysis : Participation rate complete set assessment , pair baseline discharge assessment estimate report . If compliance complete set similar compliance baseline discharge , assessment every two week consider main trial . However , compliance baseline discharge fall 60 % question value conduct large study . Differences baseline discharge analyse use ANCOVA , baseline assessment covariate . The upper 90 % limit estimate sd use future power calculation . The data multiple assessment analyse use repeat measure ANOVA , estimate within patient sd use future calculation . Confidence interval present treatment effect , upper 95 % limit use inform future planning . The qualitative analysis patient exit questionnaire consist thematic analysis synthesis . Economic Analysis : If subsequent main RCT demonstrate effectiveness MBT , analysis relative cost outcomes intervention demonstrable cost-consequence analysis use cost outcome data gather EQ-5D-5L information relate discharge destination discharge care plan . Ethics Data Protection : Ethical approval obtain ORECNI full research governance approval commencement project .</detailed_description>
