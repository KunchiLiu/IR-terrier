	<brief_summary>Pain hospitalize patient receive increase attention , however due subjective nature , defy objective , quantitative measurement . If patient able communicate , pain may assess use standardized sentence , visual analog scale ( VAS ) plain numeric scale . When patient unable communicate , method would allow caregiver continuously monitor patient ' pain alert provider patient may pain would quite useful . The Pain Monitor use novel measurement technique analyze change skin conductance use patient unable provide subjective pain score . This study compare relationship measurement take PainMonitor pain score give communicative patient evaluate safety efficacy monitor plan , routine procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Skin Conductance Values Patient Pain Scores During Minor Procedures ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although pain must assess treat , challenge obtain consistent , objective , quantifiable measurement . The best method currently available subjective scale communicate patient standardized sentence , visual analog scale ( VAS ) , plain numeric scale . When patient unable communicate , method use monitor pain inadequate . A device provide objective assessment pain patient would alert patient 's caregiver patient may pain analgesic treatment indicate . Various method ( Evans et al , 2013 ; Kantor , 2014 ; Isnardon , 2013 ) propose monitor patient ' reaction nociceptive stimulation : - change heart rate blood pressure - change microcirculation - pupillometry - EEG - Auditory somatosensory evoke potential All method find lacking , mostly due lack specificity pain . Pupillometry suitable long period measurement sensitive concomitant treatment ( e.g . opioids ) . Galvanometry potential provide specific information relate pain patient unable communicate . Since sweat gland organ control solely sympathetic nervous system , reasonable chance use galvanometry provide reliable mean assess pain . There numerous paper topic ; search PUBmed key word `` pain '' `` skin conductance '' result 250 paper ( select reference include list ) . The PainMonitor system use galvanometry monitor change skin conductance response per sec mirror number burst skin sympathetic nerve . This create warn caregiver assess potential patient pain .</detailed_description>
