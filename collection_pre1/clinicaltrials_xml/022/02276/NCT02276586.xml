	<brief_summary>Background : The actual literature consistent consider potential negative effect sub-gingival prosthetic margin periodontal health , research focus attention type prosthetic margin design . Hence , aim present study evaluate horizontal finishing line ( deep chamfer preparation ) may different influence periodontal soft tissue comparison vertical finishing line ( feather edge preparation ) . Methods : A prospective randomized control double blind clinical trial one single operator three experience examiner perform . One hundred six crown prepared horizontal tooth preparation ninety-four vertical tooth preparation . All margin position within periodontal sulcus , 0.5mm sub-gingivally all-ceramic restoration cement resin cement . Periodontal Probing Depth ( PPD ) , Plaque Index ( PI ) , Gingival Index ( GI ) Gingival Bleeding Probing ( BOP ) record prior tooth preparation twelve month crown cementation . Also , 12 month follow-up , gingival margin position relate crown margin position .</brief_summary>
