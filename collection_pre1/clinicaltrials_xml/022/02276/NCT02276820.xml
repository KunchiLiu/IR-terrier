	<brief_summary>Patients enrol study receive stem cell transplant . After transplant , immune system grow back patient risk infection . Some virus stay body life , immune system weaken ( like transplant ) , cause life-threatening infection . Adenovirus ( AdV ) virus cause symptoms common cold normally , cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system . It usually affect lung cause serious pneumonia , also affect gut , liver , pancreas eye . Investigators want see use kind white blood cell call T cell treat adenovirus infection occur transplant . Investigators observe study treatment specially trained T cell successful cell make transplant donor . However take 1-2 month make cell , approach practical patient already infection . Investigators generate AdV-specific T cell blood healthy donor create bank cell . Investigators previously successfully use frozen virus-specific T cell line generate healthy donor treat virus infection bone marrow transplant , improve production method customize bank line specifically exclusively target AdV . In study , investigator want find banked AdV-specific T cell derive healthy donor safe help treat adenoviral infection . The AdV-specific T cell ( Viralym-A ) investigational product approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To make AdV-specific T cell ( Viralym-A cell ) , small piece protein call peptide come AdV mixed blood cell healthy donor . These peptide train kind white blood cell call T cell recognize kill cell infected AdV . These T cell grown special growth factor special flasks lab . Once make sufficient number cell , test make sure recognize cell infect adenovirus , froze . When think subject need , Viralym-A cell thaw injected intravenous line . To prevent allergic reaction , prior receive Viralym-A cell subject may give diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) . The subject remain clinic least one hour infusion . After subject receives cell , transplant doctor monitor level adenovirus blood . We also take blood see long cell give subject lasting body . Subjects continue follow transplant doctor injection . The subject either see clinic contact research nurse follow study every week 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month . The subject may visit standard care . Subjects also regular blood test do follow count viral infection part standard care . To learn way Viralym-A cell work body , extra 30-40 ml ( 6-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion study follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 6 week , 3 month infusion . Blood come central intravenous line , require extra needle stick . All participant study infused number ( dose ) cell . If Viralym-A infusion help subject infection treatment , example steroid drug might destroy T cell subject give , allow receive 4 additional infusion Viralym-A cell initial dose level 28 day initial infusion . Following infusion least 14 day apart . After Viralym-A cell infusion , subject monitor described .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell single double cord blood within 24 month . 2 . Persistent recurrent adenovirus infection disease despite least 7 day standard therapy failure therapy describe unable tolerate standard therapy . Standard therapy define antiviral therapy cidofovir alternative antiviral agent patient tolerate cidofovir therapy poor renal function . i. Adenovirus infection : define presence adenoviral positivity detect polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) culture ONE site , stool blood urine nasopharynx . ii . Adenovirus disease : define presence adenoviral positivity detect PCR , Direct fluorescent assay ( DFA ) culture two site stool blood urine nasopharynx . iii . Failure therapy : define rise fall le 50 % viral load peripheral blood site disease measure PCR ( quantitative assay ) 7 day antiviral therapy . 3 . Patients multiple viral infection include AdV eligible AdV infection persistent despite standard therapy define . Patients multiple infection one reactivation one control infection eligible enroll . 4 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid equal less 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone ( equivalent ) . 5 . Received transplant care locally remain Houston area least 6 week post ViralymA infusion . 6 . Hemoglobin ( HgB ) &gt; 8.0 ( may transfuse ) . 7 . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air . 8 . Available ViralymA T cell line . 9 . Negative pregnancy test female patient applicable ( childbearing potential receive reduced intensity condition regimen ) . 10 . Informed consent explain , understood sign patient/guardian . Patient/guardian give copy inform consent . 1 . Patients receive Antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , Campath immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibody within 28 day treatment ViralymA . 2 . Patients uncontrolled/progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 3 . Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day ViralymA infusion . 4 . Patients receive investigational drug within 28 day ViralymA infusion . 5 . Patients active acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) grade IIIV . 6 . Active uncontrolled relapse malignancy .</criteria>
