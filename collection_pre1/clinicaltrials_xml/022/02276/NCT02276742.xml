Participants randomize 1 4 group , Usual Care ( UC ) , Social Cognitive Theory-based Group Counseling ( SCT ) , Mobile self-monitoring tailor feedback counseling ( MONITORING ) , combination SCT plus MONITORING condition ( COMBINED ) . Investigators evaluate intervention arm primarily term weight reduction , urinary sodium excretion , serum phosphorus , secondarily term physical activity , blood pressure , fast lipid , medication requirement , pulse wave velocity . Measurements occur baseline , 6 , 12 month . The statistical modeling baseline , 6 mo 12 mo outcome variable base logistic generalize linear mixed model ( binary outcome ) linear mixed model ( continuous outcome ) , random effect multinomial model ( outcomes 2 level , change medication management ) .

	<detailed_description>Investigators conduct 2x2 factorial , randomized clinical trial . All participant receive usual care . Prior randomization , participant stratify recruitment siteParticipants randomize 1 4 group , Usual Care ( UC ) , Social Cognitive Theory-based Group Counseling ( SCT ) , Mobile self-monitoring tailor feedback counseling ( MONITORING ) , combination SCT plus MONITORING condition ( COMBINED ) . Investigators evaluate intervention arm primarily term weight reduction , urinary sodium excretion , serum phosphorus , secondarily term physical activity , blood pressure , fast lipid , medication requirement , pulse wave velocity . Measurements occur baseline , 6 , 12 month . The statistical modeling baseline , 6 mo 12 mo outcome variable base logistic generalize linear mixed model ( binary outcome ) linear mixed model ( continuous outcome ) , random effect multinomial model ( outcomes 2 level , change medication management ) . In separate analysis intervention arm , investigator model self-monitoring adherence examine possible association self-monitoring adherence outcome . The mediate effect self-efficacy primary outcome evaluate use structural equation model II . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION 1 . Number subject . Investigators recruit 300 participant study . Investigators focus study diabetic CKD form disease progress rapidly form CKD . Focusing diabetic CKD also allow u expand logically upon Look AHEAD , build upon work T2DM patient ENHANCE study . Investigators recruit participant 3 clinical site New York City : Nephrology Family Group Practice NYU Langone Medical Center ( NYULMC ) , Bellevue Hospital Diabetes Clinic , New York Harbor VA . Preliminary data 3 practice setting indicate investigator access 4,292 potentially eligible patient investigator must recruit 7.0 % enroll 300 . Our prior study suggest investigator retain 80 % result final sample 240 . Investigators project 64 participant measurement visit Year 1 ; 248 Year 2 ; 288 Year 3 ; 244 Year 4 ; 56 Year 5 . Unless otherwise note , measurement occur baseline , 6 , 12 mo . Data collect visit NYU Clinical Translational Resource Center ( CTRC ) . Information obtain participant visit include height weight , serum urine sample ; blood pressure ; investigator administer instrument ( sociodemographics , comorbid condition , Mini Mental Status Exam , self-efficacy instrument ) , medication inventory , Pulse Wave Velocity . Eight blood test perform : cystatin-C , lipid , phosphorus , calcium , PTH parathyroid hormone , vitamin D , pre-albumin albumin . These test estimate require , total , approximately 45 ml ( blood . One week schedule measurement visit , 24-hour urine specimen container instruction collection mail participant . Participants contact 2 day prior appointment remind measurement visit , collect urine , fast , abstain caffeine 12 hour prior appointment . Laboratory test collect , spun , refrigerate , batch sent processing CLIA-certified NYU CTSI Translational Research Laboratories personnel blind group assignment . The PWV brachial-ankle ( baPWV ) carotid-femoral ( cfPWV ) collect trained research associate CTRC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order eligible study , individual must 40 year age old Have DRG Code T2DM , GFR 1589 ml/min/1.73m2 BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 . The participant 's physician record verify his/her patient safely participant intervention study involve weight loss goal 150 minutes/week moderate physical activity comparable brisk walking . Investigators exclude participation follow characteristic : 1. unable unwilling provide inform consent 2. unable participate meaningfully intervention involves group session ( e.g. , due uncorrected hearing impairment , nonEnglishspeaking ) 3. unable read otherwise use iPad monitor dietary intake , physical activity , weight ( e.g. , blind , illiterate ) 4. unwilling accept randomization assignment 5. pregnant , plan become pregnant next 12 month , less 3 month postpartum , nurse within 6 week complete nurse 6. weight loss &gt; 10 % past 6 month except postpartum weight loss 7. unable walk 0.25 mile 10 minute 8. major psychiatric disorder 9. planning gastric bypass surgery next 12 month 10. individual institutionalize ( e.g. , nursing home personal care facility , incarcerate control diet ) . Investigators exclude study underlying disease would increase risk participate intervention involve caloric restriction physical activity . Such individual would include require treatment cancer , exclusive skin cancer melanoma , past 2 year ; infectious disease include untreated AIDS active tuberculosis ; uncontrolled hypertension &gt; 190 mmHg SBP &gt; 105 mmHg DBP despite treatment ; stroke TIA past 6 month ; condition require use home oxygen ; chronic disease condition likely limit life span &lt; 1 year . Because dietary requirement pregnant woman , nature weight loss gain pregnancy , inclusion pregnant woman study would confound study result . Those become pregnant study withdrawn study .</criteria>
