	<brief_summary>Recently , E.Motion-PS-Pro ( B.Braun-Aesculap , Tuttlingen , Germany ) , new mobile bearing knee system unique ball socket post-cam mechanism develop use total knee arthroplasty . This study aim determine ( 1 ) whether use E.Motion-PS-Pro improve prosthesis fitness femur tibia term under- over-hang incidence compare establish successful prosthesis , Genesis II ( Smith &amp; Nephew , Memphis , U.S.A. ) , ( 2 ) whether patient new prosthesis experience less pain faster wound heal early recovery phase , ( 3 ) whether patient E.Motion-Pro reach functional plateau faster patient Genesis II functional plateau patient E.Motion-Pro high patient Genesis II .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome Comparison Two Total Knee Arthroplasty Systems : e.Motion-Pro Versus Genesis II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) satisfactory treatment option patient advance knee disease intractable modality term pain relief , functional restoration , deformity correction . Unfortunately , however , many patient go recovery period several month experience considerable pain suffer incompletely restored function . In recent year , improve quality life early recovery period TKA , great effort make multiple area include use minimally invasive surgical technique , improve pain management protocol , postoperative rehabilitation protocol . Nonetheless , almost inevitable presence painful disabling recovery period major concern patient schedule consider TKA treatment option . Furthermore , issue become serious obstacle elderly patient balance benefit remain year improve function replace knee burden recovery duration TKA . In theory , use good fit prosthesis sound kinematic performance shorten duration recovery period improve quality life reduce pain facilitate functional recovery . Better fitting prosthesis allegedly less involve prosthesis overhang femoral condylar level , cause impingement symptom anterior flange area , cause patellofemoral symptom . Prosthesis provide well kinematic performance natural motion joint stability throughout motion arc reduce pain discomfort early recovery period shorten duration recovery period . Recently , E.Motion-PS-Pro ( B.Braun-Aesculap , Tuttlingen , Germany ) , new mobile bearing knee system unique ball socket post-cam mechanism develop . This new prosthesis design achieve good prosthesis fitting , minimize bone loss box preparation post-cam mechanism , improve joint stability throughout motion arc , particularly high flexion , reduce risk wear fracture post increase contact area . If intend design rationales work well , prosthesis shall reduce soft tissue impingement provide good kinematic performance , reduces pain facilitates functional restoration . Therefore , current investigator aim determine ( 1 ) whether use E.Motion-PS-Pro improve prosthesis fitness femur tibia term under- over-hang incidence compare establish successful prosthesis , Genesis II ( Smith &amp; Nephew , Memphis , U.S.A. ) , ( 2 ) whether patient new prosthesis experience less pain faster wound heal early recovery phase , ( 3 ) whether patient E.Motion-Pro reach functional plateau faster patient Genesis II functional plateau patient E.Motion-Pro high patient Genesis II . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) E.Motion-Pro reduces incidence prosthesis under- over-hang , ( 2 ) patient E.Motion-Pro experience less pain faster wound heal early recovery phase , ( 3 ) patient E.Motion-Pro reach functional plateau faster functional outcome 1 year well patient E.Motion-Pro Genesis II .</detailed_description>
