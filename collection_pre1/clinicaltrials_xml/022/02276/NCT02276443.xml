	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If eligible take part study agree , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 2 study group ( call `` arm '' ) . - If Arm A , receive result molecular test tumor describe . - If Arm B , receive result molecular test tumor describe . You 1 3 chance Arm A 2 3 chance Arm B . Study Visits : At Baseline ( first visit ) : - You biopsy biomarker molecular testing . Biomarkers find tissue may relate tumor 's response therapy . To perform biopsy , affect area numb anesthetic sample tissue remove use hollow core needle cut edge . The biopsy may image-guided core biopsy . To perform image-guided core biopsy , needle insert affected area breast use image mammogram , ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) collect small piece tumor tissue . The doctor use image guide needle area . - If ultrasound perform within 4 week , also ultrasound . You receive standard-of-care chemotherapy 4 cycle . A cycle treatment may give every 2 3 week depend upon doctor 's decision . After Cycle 2 , standard-of-care ultrasound check status disease . You receive result ultrasound . If receive standard-of-care treatment closer home , ultrasound optional . After Cycle 3 4 , Arm B , receive molecular test result available . After Cycle 4 , standard-of-care ultrasound receive result test . Together , doctor decide go forward additional standard chemotherapy treatment consider clinical trial . If Arm A study , molecular test guide decision standard chemotherapy selection clinical trial . The choice standard chemotherapy make doctor cost cover study . The study team continue collect information medical record throughout study 5 year . Length Study Participation : At end 4 cycle chemotherapy study doctor discus treatment option . Taking part study affect treatment . If schedule surgery disease , still surgery schedule . This investigational study . Up 360 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient undergo biopsy surgery primary tumor site suspect proven invasive breast cancer clinical Stage I III 2 . The clinical radiologic primary tumor size least 1.5 cm diameter 3 . The patient proven TNBC , define standard pathologic assay negative ER PR ( &lt; 10 % tumor stain ) negative HER2 ( IHC score &lt; 3 , gene copy number amplify ) . 4 . Primary tumor sample collect NACT begin evaluated genomic testing ( integral biomarker ) . This allow patient participate 20110007 eligible study participation . 5 . Patients must &gt; 18 year age 6 . Patients must LVEF &gt; 50 % MUGA ECHO within 4 week prior registration . 7 .

The patient diagnosis stage IV disease find stage IV disease prior randomization . 2 . Prior history invasive cancer within 5 year study entry history metastatic cancer . Exceptions include nonmetastatic , curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . 3 . Prior excisional biopsy primary invasive breast cancer . 4 . Patients hematomas biopsy site change limit response assessment primary tumor diagnostic imaging . 5 . Patients eligible chemotherapy taxane and/or anthracycline base chemotherapy regimen . 6 . Prior therapy anthracyclines . 7 . Grade II high neuropathy . 8 . Patients Zubrod performance status &gt; 2 . 9 . Patients history serious cardiac event define : • Patients history New York Heart Association class 3 4 heart failure , history myocardial infarction , unstable angina CVA within 6 month protocol registration . • Patients history PR prolongation ( grade 2 high ) AV block .</criteria>
