	<brief_title>Cisplatin Nab-paclitaxel ( N2 ) Defined NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives To estimate rate N2 nodal clearance time surgery patient NSCLC undergo treatment neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin surgery . Estimate response rate complete response rate non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) 3 cycle neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin Estimate complete pathological response primary tumor lymph node time surgery patient NSCLC undergo treatment neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin Estimate disease free survival patient undergo surgery also stratify nodal clearance Patients assign receive three ( 3 ) cycle cisplatin ( mg/m2 ) nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg/m2 ) . Surgery conduct per standard care . Approximately 4-12 week surgical resection , patient receive one three available treatment regimen base result surgical report , include : Two four week cycle therapy Cisplatin Nab-paclitaxel ; Four three-week cycle Cisplatin Pemetrexed , four three-week cycle Cisplatin Gemcitabine Thirty ( 30 ) day treatment end , subject follow ongoing serious adverse event , necessary , every 3-6 month thereafter two year . After two year follow-up , subject follow survival disease status Estimate overall survival entire group stratify nodal clearance To estimate event free survival ( EFS ) Estimate time distant recurrence time local recurrence follow total study procedure</detailed_description>
