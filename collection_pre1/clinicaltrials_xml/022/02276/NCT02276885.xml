	<brief_title>Prone Partial Breast Irradiation ( PBI ) : Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite fact less extensive experience brachytherapy available , PBI delivery external-beam many advantage . First , likely acceptable patient since non-invasive require surgical procedure anesthesia . Moreover , since deliver surgery , pathological analysis segmental mastectomy specimen available inform selection best candidate . In addition , EB-PBI likely become widely reproducible , since rely experience skill radiation oncologist perform brachytherapy implant . Besides , technique establish , widely apply facility provide linear accelerator , without risk present brachytherapy approach complete unfavorable interplay patient 's anatomy technical limitation applicator . The woman study receive either 5 3 radiation fraction tumor bed . We choose study T1 post menopausal woman subset : 1 ) tumor small enough treat partial breast radiation 2 ) odds multicentric disease low , make ethical avoid whole breast irradiation , 3 ) benefit reduce radiation schedule 5 3 could expect . All patient receive either 8 Gy x 3 5 day , every day 6 Gy x 5 5 day , five consecutive day</detailed_description>
