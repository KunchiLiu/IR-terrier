	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial stewardship define activity promotes appropriate selection , dose , route duration antibiotic therapy . Antimicrobial stewardship program usually include pharmacist and/or doctor expertise infection disease management . Prospective chart review physician feedback common intervention use antimicrobial stewardship program improve antibiotic utilization patient outcome . Pneumonia common reason antibiotic utilization hospital . Significant variation antibiotic utilization patient pneumonia repeatedly demonstrate publish study despite existence best-practice treatment guideline . Treatment variation guideline demonstrate result bad outcome increase mortality . Antimicrobial stewardship program help reduce treatment variation guideline . Despite improvement certain outcome , antimicrobial stewardship program demonstrate impact length stay patient admit hospital pneumonia . Part absence evidence may due poor study design failure recruit sufficient patient . This study include implementation antimicrobial stewardship program across many hospital study design analysis account design problem previous study .</detailed_description>
