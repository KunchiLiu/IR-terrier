	<brief_summary>The Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) non invasive measure lung function sensitive FEV1 . It use measure lung function child young 6 year age . Therefore , future role assess novel therapeutic Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) population . As , determine use short term pharmacodynamic biomarker paramount .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized-Controlled Trial Inhaled Hypertonic Saline ( 7 % ) Evaluate Lung Clearance Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhaled Hypertonic saline ( 7 % ) treatment intervention Cystic Fibrosis patient previously show improve lung function decrease number pulmonary exacerbation . The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Gene ( CFTR ) protein essential maintain fluid electrolyte homeostasis lung CFTR defect cause depletion periciliary liquid layer result impair mucociliary clearance . Inhaled hypertonic saline ( 7 % ) act osmotic agent lung ; replete airway surface liquid ( ASL ) improve mucociliary clearance . In addition , recently demonstrate Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) also responsive outcome measure . In intervention study patient treat hypertonic saline inhalation twice daily 28 day , LCI FEV1 significantly improve 17 pediatric Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) patient mild lung disease . In study , LCI sensitive change response treatment spirometry small number patient . However , still remain unknown LCI able detect treatment effect short time scale intervention . Its use short-term pharmacodynamic biomarker CF patient remain unknown . The ability LCI detect treatment effect within hour intervention would invaluable development new therapeutic intervention CF patient .</detailed_description>
