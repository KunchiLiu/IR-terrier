	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate activity pattern peroneal muscle group , individual history chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) ankle injury compare individual without ankle problem . The study also aim determine effect target exercise programme muscle group patient CAI . Research topic may provide important insight role muscle chronic ankle instability investigate whether specific strengthen programmes effective complex patient category .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Activation Chronic Ankle Instability Effect Exercise Programme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate role peroneus brevis ( PB ) peroneus longus ( PL ) muscle patient chronic ankle instability determine whether eccentric- concentric focus training intervention effect muscle . Volunteers recruit Orthopaedic Clinics Musculoskeletal Assessment Clinics St. Vincent 's University Hospital . Posters information leaflet supply area volunteer seek . A study information sheet give patient write consent obtain prior commence investigative study . Inclusion Criteria The selection criterion chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) patient base position statement International Ankle Consortium ( Gribble et al . 2013 ) . - A history least 1 significant ankle sprain - A history previously injure ankle joint `` give way '' , and/or recurrent sprain , and/or `` feeling instability '' . Self-reported ankle instability confirm validated ankle instability-specific questionnaire : The Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool ( CAIT ) . CAIT simple , valid , reliable tool measure severity functional ankle instability . - A general self-reported foot ankle function questionnaire also complete . The Foot Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) : The FAAM reliable , responsive , valid measure physical function individual broad range musculoskeletal disorder low leg , foot , ankle . Exclusion Criteria - Acute injury musculoskeletal structure joint low extremity previous 3 month impact joint integrity function ( ie , sprain , fracture ) , result least 1 interrupted day desire physical activity - Any Neurological problem would affect muscle function lower limb - Pregnant Women - Participants 18 65 Controls - Healthy Volunteers ( Control ) age sex match CAI variant - Will previous history significant ankle sprain , interrupt desired physical activity . CAI patient refer two radiological examination St. Vincent 's Hospital aid diagnosis : 1 . A diagnostic ultrasound perform Dr. Eric Heffernan look peroneal tendon pathology ligament character ( thicken continuity ) . 2 . Stress Fluoroscopy ( Anterior Drawer Talar Tilt ) perform Professor Robert Flavin ass biplanar instability rule subtalar instability . Both participant CAI participant without ankle instability undergo Surface electromyography ( S-EMG ) assessment PL , PB Tibialis Anterior ( TA ) static dynamic condition University College Dublin School Public Health , Physiotherapy &amp; Population science ( SPHPPS ) motion analysis laboratory ( This assessment process initially pilot healthy volunteer ) Muscle onset determine S-EMG also normalize Max Voluntary Contraction ( MVC ) determine magnitude activation , Single leg Stance , wobble-board standing , walk , calf-raise exercise , tip-toe walking , jog jump-landing task . Kinematic variable ( degree movement speed ) also re-coded use CODA motion capture system movement task . The participant perform functional test force platform allow assessment kinetic variable measure ground reaction force measure postural control . Following S-EMG test CAI subject commence six-week eccentric-concentric focused exercise programme . The exercise intervention consist individual home-based progressive eccentric-concentric strengthening programme . Patients review every two week rehabilitation ; exercise progress accordingly physiotherapist . Patients supply exercise diary assist adherence exercise protocol . At end six-week programme undergo repeat S-EMG test complete self-reported ankle questionnaire use pre-test phase . If use power level 80 % 5 % significance , sample size 13 participant study group would require study . To allow 23 % dropout rate aim recruit 16 patient group .</detailed_description>
