	<brief_summary>Ublituximab ( also know LFB-R603 ) monoclonal antibody specifically bind trans-membrane antigen CD20 . The binding induces immune response cause lysis B cell . The rationale use ublituximab neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder ( NMOSD ) base know role B cell , antibody production plasma cell pathophysiology NMO . NMO characterize presence anti-AQP4 antibody , produce differentiation B cell plasma cell . Because anti-AQP4 antibody may pathogenic , B cell recognize AQP4 may directly involve disease process well . B cell also play role potent antigen present cell NMO . The strong evidence importance B cell NMO come study B cell depletion , commonly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , rituximab ( RituxanÂ® ) . Rituximab show five retrospective two prospective study effective reduce NMO relapse 90 % achieve remission 80 % patient solely action CD20+ B cell , despite change plasma cell population anti-AQP4 antibody titer . These human trial strongly suggest critical role B cell pathophysiology human disease . While typically use prevention disease , B-cell depletion may beneficial treatment acute relapse well . Emerging evidence indicate peripheral B cell activate relapse plasmablast production anti-AQP4 antibody spike . B cell also find within acute lesion spinal cord optic nerve suggest role blood central nervous system relapse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective ass safety ublituximab add-on therapy steroid treatment acute optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis NMO NMOSD . Primary Objective To assess safety acute B cell depletion NMO subject acute relapse optic neuritis transverse myelitis treat ublituximab + glucocorticoid begin dose administration end recovery B cell . Secondary Objectives - To determine B cell depletion pharmacokinetics ublituximab NMO patient population monthly B cell count 9 month . - To determine frequency adverse event ublituximab patient population . Trial Design Given severity consequence relapse NMO , placebo treatment without steroid treatment unethical use active treatment consider mandatory . The potential currently utilized drug technique reduce inflammation NMO establish primarily expert consensus small open label retrospective study . This Phase 1 open-label , standard-of-care , single treatment arm , unblinded , single center interventional trial NMO/NMOSD patient experimental subject receive one ( 1 ) infusion 450 mg intravenous ublituximab onset NMO exacerbation addition standard care treatment daily intravenous glucocorticoid 1000 mg five day .</detailed_description>
