	<brief_summary>This study evaluate colonic analgesia compare two novel formulation , GIC-1001 GIC-1002 placebo use barostat distender . The healthy male female volunteer randomize one 5 possible treatment expose rectal distension follow 3-day treatment TID . The barostat methodology well-established validated way assess visceral pain . Visceral pain evaluate exposure vary distender pressure use visual analog scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Analgesia GIC-1001 &amp; GIC-1002 Visceral Pain , Rectal Sensory Threshold Using Barostat Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective single center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled Phase I clinical study include evaluation visceral pain intensity rectal distension follow oral administration either two dos GIC-1001 either two dos GIC-1002 , equimolar first formulation , placebo 90 healthy subject . The barostat intra-balloon pressure require elicit pre-defined rectal sensory symptom ( i.e . first sensation , need defecate , urgency defecate pain ) also determine . Rectal sensory symptom rating rectal compliance increase rectal distension also evaluate . The contribution hydrogen sulphide ( H2S ) colonic analgesic activity GIC-1001 comparison GIC-1002 evaluate follow steady state pharmacokinetic analysis . To comprehend non-linear , U shape dose response curve observe GIC-1001 previous Phase II trial . Finally , safety GIC-1002 healthy volunteer also evaluate .</detailed_description>
