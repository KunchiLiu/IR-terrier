	<brief_summary>Anaemia frequent among critically ill patient , concern 60 % admission 80 % intensive care unit discharge . Iron deficiency also frequent admission , prevalence around 25 40 % . During stay Intensive Care Unit , critically ill patient expose repeat blood sample blood loss ( daily blood loss evaluate high 128 ml/day median ) , lead direct iron loss . Prevalence iron deficiency may thus important Intensive Care Unit discharge . However , iron deficiency diagnosis complicate patient , since inflammation induces increase plasma ferritin level decrease transferrin saturation , two usual marker iron deficiency . As consequence , iron deficiency usely under-diagnosed patient . Treatment iron deficiency may indicate correct anaemia also improve patient fatigue muscular weakness . The characterization iron metabolism regulation hormone hepcidin open new way understand follow-up complex clinical situation ( combine inflammation iron deficiency ) . Indeed , iron deficiency associate decrease hepcidin synthesis , iron overload induces hepcidin synthesis . Furthermore , low hepcidin level require mobilize iron store . Hepcidin thus propose marker iron deficiency critically ill patient . To date , standard immunological method hepcidin quantitation propose reasearch set could propose clinical set expensive . New approach hepcidin quantification , base mass spectrometry propose may routinely implement . We make hypothesis treating iron deficiency critically ill anemic patient , diagnose hepcidin quantification , may improve post-Intensive Care Unit rehabilitation , may thus reduce post-Intensive Care Unit cost link hospital stay anaemia treatment . The aim study evaluate medical economic interest new diagnostic method iron deficiency , base quantitative dosage hepcidin mass spectrometry critically ill anaemic patient .</brief_summary>
