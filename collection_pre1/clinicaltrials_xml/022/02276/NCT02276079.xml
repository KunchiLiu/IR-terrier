	<detailed_description>This `` proof-of-principle '' project human subject examine safety feasibility implement 1-week aerobic exercise program post-acute phase mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . This study define extent exercise program improve recovery mTBI term relevant functional outcome ( cognition , mood , physical status ) biomarkers ( peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor [ BDNF ] concentration ) . This project also lay foundation understand relationship exercise BDNF area mTBI neurorecovery , thereby allow future study develop best-practice method implement exercise intervention treatment option brain injury .</detailed_description>
