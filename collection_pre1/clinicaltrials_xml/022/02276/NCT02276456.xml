	<brief_summary>With prior prospective study demonstrate benefit early post-discharge follow-up appointment reduce readmission rate post-myocardial infarction ( MI patient population , propose conduct first randomize , prospective trial well elucidate association early standard follow-up readmission rate . The investigator hypothesize unlike heart failure advance valvular disease patient , benefit early outpatient follow-up reduce readmission post-MI patient less clear . Thus , investigator primary aim determine effect early outpatient follow-up post-discharge 90 day all-cause readmission rate ( exclusive plan readmission know time discharge ) . Secondary aim describe 1 ) cause readmission within 90 day , 2 ) cardiovascular-related complication death occur discharge 90 day , 3 ) 30-day readmission rate 4 ) median time readmission among readmitted . Finally , investigator examine distribution demographic , clinical socioeconomic characteristic accord readmission vs. readmission . The investigator expect sufficient endpoint full predictive modeling , believe exploratory work provide foundation future study . The investigator postulate design methodology current study could use answer similar question subset patient .</brief_summary>

Clinical event treatment hospitalization ( e.g. , medical management versus cardiac catheterization , ICU vs. nonICU care , choice medication , etc . ) influence inclusion trial inclusion trial influence treatment hospitalization follow , except time followup appointment . Patients treat coronary artery bypass graft excluded purpose trial avoid conflict usual postoperative management . Additionally , patient feature clinical course would preclude possibility readmission exclude . Examples include transition care goal comfort care , transition care inpatient outpatient hospice , development complication hospitalization require early follow appointment ( e.g. , diagnosis malignancy ) . Patients discharge skilled nursing facility eligible study .</criteria>
