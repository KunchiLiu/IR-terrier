A suite standardized ad-hoc physical performance test , patient-reported questionnaire , monitor technology carefully select ass important , clinically-relevant participant outcome . Comparative effectiveness three prosthetic knee intervention evaluate use direct measurement ( i.e. , time test ) , observed clinical rating ( i.e. , subjective assessment gait quality ) self-report instrument ( i.e. , health status survey ) . Analyses focus identify difference control system technology inherent type prosthetic knee ( i.e. , passive [ mechanical ] , adaptive [ magnetorheological ] , active [ power ] ) .
