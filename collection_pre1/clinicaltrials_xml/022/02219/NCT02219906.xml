	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome group risk factor increase patient 's likelihood heart attack , stroke diabetes . Our research aim understanding whether drug , resveratrol , commonly find grape red wine , would benefit reduce risk factor patient metabolic syndrome . Despite use aspirin cholesterol reduce medication , patient metabolic syndrome still often sticky platelet dysfunctional lipid profile . This likely due inflammation high oxidative state . In animal study , drug reduce platelet stickiness reduce oxidative stress . However , effect drug research patient metabolic syndrome . We interested study whether benefit resveratrol describe animal model translate patient metabolic syndrome display high marker oxidative stress . We plan give short intervention drug patient determine drug successfully : 1 . Decreases stickiness platelet . This important sticky platelet likely form clot contribute plaque formation . 2 . Reduce circulate dysfunctional HDL . HDL protein lipid constituent help inhibit oxidation , inflammation , activation blood vessel wall , coagulation , platelet aggregation . Dysfunctional HDL , occur metabolic syndrome patient , properly protect atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients metabolic syndrome increase risk thrombotic complication , include myocardial infarction cardiovascular death . A meta-analysis study assess cardiovascular risk metabolic syndrome find pool relative risk incident cardiovascular event death 1.78 . This propensity thrombotic vascular event context increase prevalence metabolic syndrome , 2003-2006 NHANES Survey find 34 % US population age 20 . Two important contributor development myocardial infarction stroke lipid rich atheromatous plaque concomitant platelet aggregation response fissure plaque . A grow body evidence implicate oxidative modification lipoprotein lipids apolipoproteins genesis plaque . Platelet hyperactivity variable response antiplatelet therapy feature metabolic syndrome . Oxidative modification LDL enhance activation platelet , oxidatively stress . Myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) initiate lipid peroxidation lead dysfunctional HDL production . Therefore , hypotheses propose investigation address effect resveratrol platelet hyperactivity HDL protein modification patient metabolic syndrome . Resveratrol , predict structure , electron rich molecule reduce free radical . It distinctive action , however , differ compound conventionally refer `` anti-oxidants '' . It particular potency inhibitor radical formation number peroxidase likely participate pathophysiology metabolic syndrome . These include MPO , peroxidase site prostaglandin H synthase-1 ( PGHS-1 ; cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) ) cytochrome c. We test hypothesis : 1. resveratrol reduces platelet activation patient metabolic syndrome . 2. resveratrol reduces oxidative modification HDL proteins patient metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
