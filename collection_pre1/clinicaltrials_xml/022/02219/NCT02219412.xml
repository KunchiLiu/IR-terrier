The aim study estimate difference arachidonic acid induce platelet aggregation rate ticagrelor mono-therapy aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy 14 day treatment patient stable coronary artery disease . The potential hypothesis arachidonic acid ( AA ) induce platelet aggregation rate 2 week ticagrelor mono-therapy comparable aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arachidonic Acid-induced Platelet Aggregation Rate Patients With Stable CAD Treated With Ticagrelor Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label , active-controlled pilot study estimate difference arachidonic acid induce platelet aggregation rate ticagrelor monotherapy aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy patient stable coronary heart disease . The anticipated duration study approximately 9 month , include anticipated enrolment period 8 month follow-up period 4weeks . Patients document coronary heart disease currently receive dual-antiplatelet therapy standard dose aspirin clopidogrel enrol study site . For patient post acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , must dual-antiplatelet therapy least 12 month eligible study . The study plan , include enrolment/randomization follow-up visit , outline Table 1 . Eligible patient enter washout phase ticagrelor 2 week . Then randomize take either ticagrelor alone aspirin/ticagrelor 14 day . The efficacy evaluation do 7 14days randomization . The primary efficacy parameter rate arachidonic acid induce platelet aggregation 14 day treatment . All patient treat standard care coronary heart disease secondary prevention . Visit 0 ( Screening Enrollment , 0 day ) All potentially eligible patient undergo screen visit follow sign informed consent . Following 8-hour fast , patient screen evaluation perform . Demography , medical history , concomitant medication record . A physical examination vital sign ( pulse BP ) , height weight , well blood sample laboratory assessment complete blood count ( CBC ) differential , serum creatinine , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , AA , adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) collagen induced platelet aggregation rate do . Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) reading record . Patients meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion enrol . Patients receive ticagrelor mono-therapy even 14 day . IP dispense . Visit 1 ( Randomization , 14 day ) Suspected adverse event ( AEs ) record . A physical examination vital sign ( pulse BP ) , well blood sample laboratory assessment AA , ADP collagen induce platelet aggregation rate serum thromboxane B2 concentration do . Patients tell take ticagrelor morning Visit 1 . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive either ticagrelor mono-therapy aspirin/ticagrelor dual-therapy . Investigational product ( IP ) return compliance assess new bottle IP dispense accord randomize group . Visit 2 ( 21 day ) Suspected AEs record . Vital sign ( pulse BP ) well blood sample laboratory assessment AA , ADP collagen induce platelet aggregation rate do . Visit 3 ( End treatment , 28 day ) Suspected AEs record . Vital sign ( pulse BP ) well blood sample laboratory assessment CBC differential , Scr , ALT AST , AA , ADP collagen induce platelet aggregation rate do . IP return compliance assess . Instructions medication study give patient time . For patient prematurely discontinue randomize treatment , complete end treatment visit prefer .</detailed_description>
