	<brief_title>Comparing Nasal Suction Devices Children With Bronchiolitis : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis viral illness common cause admission hospital . Most patient bronchiolitis manage home . The indication hospitalization poor feeding ( due increase mucus production ) respiratory distress without hypoxia . The EDOU common destination patient bronchiolitis . Patients admit EDOU respiratory monitoring , suction poor oral intake . The management bronchiolitis mostly supportive include frequent feeding , nasal suctioning , intravenous fluid oxygen necessary . The patient admit EDOU receive frequent nasal suction suction device ( NeoSucker ) deep suction need . Since young infant `` nose breather , '' use nasal suctioning help relieve nasal congestion/upper airway obstruction assist ability breathe feed . Suctioning accomplish use bulb suction , nasal aspirator and/or suction catheter connect pressure device . The role type suction device management bronchiolitis study extensively . In study , nasal aspirator ( develop Sweden Ear , Nose Throat specialist ) brand name NoseFrida compare NeoSucker , suction catheter currently use hospital set require nurse pressure device . Nasal suction less traumatic cause discomfort , bleed rebound swell deep suctioning . Upon admission , patient randomize either NoseFrida NeoSucker group . After consent obtain agreed participation , patient parent randomize NoseFrida group give NoseFrida/filters instruction usage ( instructional video/postcard ) . The parent encourage use NoseFrida suction device often want , especially feeds sleep . The patient randomized NeoSucker group give current standard care nasal suction nurse . Both group deep suction clinically need .</detailed_description>
