	<brief_summary>We hypothesize ultrasound detectable variation nerve , tendon SSCT mobility patient CTS may useful clinically , diagnose CTS , instead functional biomarkers correlate , thereby serve predictor , treatment response . To test hypothesis , propose longitudinal clinical study patient present treatment CTS monitor ultrasound clinical assessment non-surgical surgical treatment . We correlate clinical outcome initial ultrasound motion pattern find variable CTS patient . We also test hypothesis successful treatment result change towards normal affect ultrasound variable .</brief_summary>
