	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy lymph node dissection treatment gastric cancer popular East Asian country . However , long-term follow-up outcome base randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) still rare . Some study indicate laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy D2 lymphadenectomy technically feasible safe procedure experience surgeon high-volume specialized hospital . However , application still limit lack solid evidence oncologic efficacy . Nowadays , proportion patient locally advanced gastric cancer estimate 80 percent gastric cancer case China . Before clinical application laparoscopic procedure treatment curative intent advance gastric cancer locate middle- lower-third stomach , oncologic efficacy must verified.Accordingly , comparison long-term outcome laparoscopic open distal subtotal gastrectomy D2 lymphadenectomy locally advanced gastric cancer base well design RCT need .</brief_summary>
