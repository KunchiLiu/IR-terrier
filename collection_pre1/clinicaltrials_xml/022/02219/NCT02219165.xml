	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes produce many virulence factor . Some responsible severe infection human . Superantigen toxin synthesize S. aureus S. pyogenes , responsible toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) lethality attain 25 % child validate criterion septic shock . Previous study , perform vitro vivo animal , show Intravenous immunoglobulin [ IVIG ] contain antibody [ Ab ] toxin , use high concentration , IVIG able neutralize toxicity . However , study , IVIG administration preventive reliable data demonstrate therapeutic efficacy vitro vivo human animal , disease present . The efficacy IVIG establish pathology role superantigens [ superAg ] suspect , like Kawasaki disease child . The mechanism action , although perfectly know , involve time direct effect superAg ( Ag-Ab complex ) indirect effect like neutralisation superAg within network anti-idiotype Ab neutralisation T-cells receptor . Staphylococcal streptococcal toxic shock imply bacterial exotoxin superAg . It seem thus consistent imagine type treatment IVIG . However , currently evidence efficacy IVIG indication . One explanation rely lack statistical power previous adult study , principal objective show reduction mortality . Taking account low prevalence TSS , hard recruit enough patient require statistical power . Moreover , work extract large study septic shock definition TSS always reliable . Lastly , investigator consider definition TSS mention `` Centre Disease Control `` [ CDC ] , hypotension , even simple orthostatic hypotension , serve diagnosis TSS long symptoms present , obvious many patient likely recruit study although highly probable health get good `` standard `` treatment . The definition `` real `` TSS refine , keep CDC criterion , change hypotension criterion accurate criterion describe `` survive sepsis campaign `` , internationally accept base norm adapt age paediatric form . IVIG therapy expensive TSS recognize indication IVIG accord marketing authorization . The feasibility randomize control study treatment need assess would hazardous conduct large prospective RCT without first assessed feasibility term recruitment rate , consent rate compliance rate . Inclusion , randomisation collect inform consent context severe shock challenge require evaluation feasibility . The sample size calculation large study mortality require estimation event specific population child criteria septic shock . Surrogates marker outcome need good define . For example would useful determine evolution organ dysfunction without IVIG treatment population . Various organ failure score , use upon admission later , validate adults child . The absence improvement Paediatric logistic organ dysfunction ( Pelod ) score time good indicator mortality Paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . It could use surrogate marker evaluate efficacy IVIG .</brief_summary>
