	<detailed_description>Dry eye major , common medical condition significant health burden Singapore worldwide . As much one third adult population Asian country affect dry eye . It show dry eye affect quality life , include perform daily activity read driving car . Moderate severity dry eye affect patient like moderate angina . The direct indirect cost treat dry eye high increase . For example , cost individual US $ 800 per year treat dry eye , cost society manage patient US $ 12000 per year . ( 1-29 ) Dry eye holistic problem affect live habit work long hour computer dry , air-conditioned environment . It also associate poor nutrition intake dietary supplement omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid may help treat dry eye . Dry eye also systemic immune mediate disease , aggravate autoimmune Sjögren 's syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , thyroid disease , systemic lupus erythematosis , Steven Johnson syndrome chronic graft versus host disease . In recent international workshop , international expert dry eye agree hallmark disease raise tear osmolarity ocular surface inflammation . Traditionally , dry eye diagnose reduced Schirmer 's test and/or reduce tear break time presence dry eye symptom . In addition traditional test , would advantageous incorporate measurement osmolarity inflammation clinical study . There definitive cure condition , treatment form lubricants symptomatic treatment cyclosporine eye drop expensive may well tolerate . Treatment steroid effective associated adverse effect sight threaten glaucoma . In summary definite medical need alternative therapy dry eye . Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) involve restore natural balance body , result disease like dry eye disturbed . In TCM philosophy , dry eye may result syndrome yin deficiency liver kidney . Modalities acupuncture herb use judiciously restore balance specific patient . Recently randomize controlled study dry eye use acupuncture herb , mixed result , refer attachment ( Table 1 ) . The major limitation study objective tear film evaluation tear osmolarity , tear cytokine protein , indicative ocular surface inflammation , evaluate . In addition , study suffer lack proper control randomization . If mainstream practitioner evidence base medicine convince TCM fundamentally alter pathological process dry eye , receptive form treatment . At time , regulatory body need reassure TCM safe dry eye , education promotion treatment benefit people . The PI run dry eye clinic twice week Singapore National Eye Centre since 2006 . He aware many dry eye patient Singapore experience host conventional therapy eager attempt alternative form therapy . This trend towards TCM holistic medicine continue regardless attitude 'western ' medical practitioner . This study , complete , present opportunity bridge gap two health care community normally interact . Since late scientific tool term protein science image employ study , definitely increase evidence base medicine TCM dry eye field . The PI publish 67 peer review paper dry eye relate ocular surface process , include review article , ( 30-34 ) international expert panel report , ( 35 ) epidemiological study , ( 36-37 ) PI initiate industry sponsor interventional drug include randomize controlled drug trial . ( 38-40 ) In one pharmacy Singapore alone , cost dry eye medication amount US $ 1.5 million one year . ( 3 ) He also find epidemiological study Singapore people dry eye impairs visual associate function related activity daily live . ( 41 ) He establish dedicate dry eye service region produce many paper relate assessment patient , ( 42-46 ) include one found dry eye related amount exposure stressful activity condition . ( 46 ) The PI experience biochemical evaluation patient tear material dry eye ( 47-51 ) clinical imaging relate dry eye . ( 52-54 ) Lastly , also appear mass medium educational article include press release articles/talks layperson general practitioner . A survey conduct among registered TCM practitioner Singapore publish peer review journal . ( 55 ) This show significant proportion institutional practitioner keen practice dry eye . This study also choose present oral presentation 10th Asean Congress TCM cum 3rd Asia Advanced Forum Acupuncture Moxibustion . At time , full article translate Chinese congress proceeding page 192-197 appeal audience TCM physicians . The PI also participate discussion data analysis TCM trial . ( 56-57 ) In addition , acupuncture rabbit show induce change tear protein , although evaluate human . ( 58 ) 1 . HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES The overall hypothesis traditional Chinese medicine modality acupuncture herbs improve symptom sign dry eye , objectively , improvement associate reduction tear osmolarity reduction inflammatory marker tear cytokine proinflammatory protein . There also long term objective integrating TCM mainstream medical care cost-effective approach eye disease . Primary outcome : • Change SPEED score ( Week4-Week0 ) Secondary outcome : - Change Tear Evaporimetry - Change TCM score ( Lung-Kidney Yin deficiency ) - Change NIBUT - Change Schirmers I - Change Corneal fluorescein stain ( 5 zone ) - Change Tear osmolarity - Change Tear meniscus height - Change Tear protein/ cytokine level 1.1 Primary Objectives We aim show dry eye patient treated acupuncture efficacious ( improve symptom sign dry eye ) safe ( ocular systemic side effect ) . 1.2 Secondary Objectives We aim show dry eye patient treat herbal preparation efficacious ( result reduction symptom sign dry eye ) safe ( ocular systemic side effect ) . We also aim show objective , definitive hallmark dry eye disease , ie . Tear osmolarity surrogates ocular surface inflammation , tear cytokine proinflammatory protein , reduce treatment acupuncture herbal treatment , compare control . 1.3 Potential Risks Benefits : 1.3.1 Potential Risks We anticipate minimal risk discomfort involve study . - It possible eyelid bruising swelling may occur acupuncture needle - Some slight discomfort Schirmers I test - Nausea , insomnia , headache , loss appetite , malaise , diarrhoea abdominal cramp may occur herbal consumption Relatively complication report use acupuncture . However , acupuncture cause potentially serious side effect deliver properly qualify practitioner . The common side effect acupuncture include soreness , bruise , fatigue , lightheadedness involuntary twitching muscle . Should event occur , increased frequency visit eye clinic may necessary . 1.3.2 Potential Benefits There assurance participant benefit study . However , participation may contribute medical knowledge whether TCM medicine fundamentally alter pathological process dry eye . At time , regulatory body need reassure TCM safe dry eye , education promotion treatment benefit people . 2 . STUDY POPULATION 3.1 List The Number Nature Subjects Enrolled . One hundred fifty eligible dry eye subject screen recruited SCHMI . 3.2 Criteria Recruitment Recruitment Process 1 . Subjects meet inclusion criterion list . 2 . Clear exclusion criterion . Permission would seek attend TCM physician subject recruit . Eligible subject counsel study . If subject interested , informed write consent obtain participant . Thereafter , optometrsits SCHMI schedule baseline visit SERI ocular monitoring . 3.3 Inclusion Criteria For eligibility participant present SCHMI must assess TCM physician optometrist , find satisfy every one following : 1 .

Treatment arm There 3 trial arm study : - Control : Systane Ultra Eye drop ( n=50 ) - Systane Ultra Eye Drop Acupuncture treatment ( n=50 ) - Systane Ultra Eye Drop Herbs treatment ( n=50 ) Study duration : 5 Weeks Recruitment duration : 1 Year 4.1 Randomisation Blinding The randomisation procedure use entail : 1 . Presence two witness 2 . Drawing lots 3 . Randomization cod 3 group note . For e.g . 001A , 002B , 003C etc . 4 . Study information relate randomisation file keep SCHMI 5 . Only unblinded personnel access randomization code file Randomisation do SCHMI . Study member SCHMI unblinded deliver TCM treatment subject . However , study member SERI blind prevent unintentional bias assess monitoring ocular surface . In situation serious event , decision whether open ( break ) code specific patient necessary . Although advantageous retain blind patient prior final study analysis , serious adverse reaction judge reportable expedited basis , recommend blind broken specific patient designate investigator unblind . It also recommend , possible appropriate , blind maintain person , biometrics personnel , responsible analysis interpretation result study 's conclusion .</detailed_description>
