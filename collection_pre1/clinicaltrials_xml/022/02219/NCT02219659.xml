	<detailed_description>A three-arm , randomize , pilot feasibility , study ass effect three validate sedation strategy outcomes patient mechanical ventilation . A significant proportion patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) require mechanical ventilation ( MV ) . To maintain comfort facilitate quality care , large quantity sedatives analgesic often administer either continuous infusion , without daily interruption ( DI ) sedation , intermittent dos analgesic . Three validated sedation strategy currently available . A recently publish SLEAP trial show institute protocol-directed sedation patient require continuous infusion sedative analgesic , whether daily interruption ( DI ) sedative occurs , improve MV outcome , specifically duration MV . Girard et al perform randomize , multicenter , clinical trial ( ABC- Awakening Breathing Controlled trial ) evaluate pair spontaneous awaken trial ( SAT ) SBT . Most recently , Danish study Strøm et al . investigated whether analgesia-first approach patient comfort consist intermittent dos intravenous opioids , initiation IV sedation short period acute agitation present , would superior protocol similar ABC trial . While three mention approach accept currently implement critical care community comparative study evaluation optimal time conduct spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) assess wean readiness strategy . It possible SAT strategy , sedative opioid infusion interrupt , may lead agitation anxiety strategy patient manage sedation protocol intravenous sedative analgesic therapy regularly titrate maintain patient lightly sedate state . Moreover , remain unclear whether advantage analgesia-first sedation strategy either SAT sedation protocol strategy term time take wean patient MV . However , noteworthy mention analgesia-first strategy associate delirium episode , attribute ability ass awake patient . However , compare delirium occurrence study different sedation goal methodology may inaccurate . The investigator therefore propose three-arm , randomize , pilot feasibility , study ass effect three ( 3 ) validate strategy sedation pain management</detailed_description>
