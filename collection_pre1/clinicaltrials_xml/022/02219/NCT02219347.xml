	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis common condition affect approximately 1 % United Kingdom populationÍ¾ autoimmune disease body 's natural defence ( immune system ) attack body result , notably , joint damage arthritis . To help prevent , patient rheumatoid arthritis need take disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) . As rheumatoid arthritis life-long condition , drug treatment prescribe long-term medication take many year . With successful drug treatment , many patient able achieve excellent control disease arthritis go remission . At present , marker reliably predict patient reduce drug treatment , hence benefit low risk side effect inconvenience , without increase arthritis activity . We invite patient stable rheumatoid arthritis participate study conduct Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust collaboration Newcastle University fund Wellcome Trust . Patients whose arthritis confirm remission able stop DMARD medication monitor period 6 month . Patients whose arthritis activity increase time able restart DMARD medication , whereas patient whose arthritis remain remission able stay DMARD medication . The main aim study identify clinical , ultrasound blood marker predict patient remain remission stop DMARD medication . If identify , marker could useful guide doctor patient future decide whether stop DMARD therapy .</brief_summary>
