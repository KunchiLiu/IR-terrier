	<brief_summary>Patients usually experience moderate-to-severe pain follow knee replacement often treat femoral nerve block ( injection numb medicine place around main nerve knee joint ) . To make nerve block last longer , tiny tube often place next nerve numb medicine infuse multiple day . However , numb medicine take away pain , also decrease sensation , muscle strength , proprioception ( know leg space without look ) greatly increase risk fall . Since fall catastrophic follow major surgery , femoral nerve block phase surgeon anesthesiologist . The most-promising replacement call adductor canal nerve block . For new type block , perineural catheter insert small canal middle upper leg . This canal contain sensory nerve fiber lead knee , single nerve serf relatively small muscle . Multiple study demonstrate dramatic increase muscle strength use new adductor canal block compare traditional femoral block . However , practitioner perceptions new block provide insufficient pain control follow knee arthroplasty , even though sensory nerve affect femoral block also—theoretically—affected adductor canal block . One reason difference may small canal latter relatively tight area numb medicine might spread particularly well ( due pressure surround tissue ) . One way possibly counter issue provide repeat bolus numb medicine improve medicine 's spread relative more-traditional slow , continuous ( `` basal '' ) infusion . This study seek compare two technique medication administration perineural adductor canal catheter : Our primary aim test hypothesis , continuous adductor canal block , provide local anesthetic repeat , hourly bolus dos result increase sensory block compare provide local anesthetic continuous basal infusion equivalent hourly dose . As secondary aim , hypothesize , continuous adductor canal block , provide local anesthetic repeat , hourly bolus dos result either equivalent less motor block compare provide local anesthetic continuous basal infusion equivalent hourly dose .</brief_summary>

Subjects bilateral adductor canal perineural catheter place use standard UC San Diego techniques.10-11 Treatment Group Assignment . Subjects act control : The dominant side ( left right ) randomize one two treatment group : ropivacaine 0.2 % administration either basal infusion ( 8 mL/h ) bolus dos ( 8 mL administer hourly ) . The non-dominant contralateral side receive possible treatment . Randomization base computer-generated code . Randomization block two , stratify sex . An infusion pump study infusate attach perineural catheter initiate Hour 0 . The basal rate bolus volume depend upon treatment group ( note basal rate bolus volume differ treatment group , total dose local anesthetic ) : Treatment Group Basal Rate ( mL/h ) Basal Dose ( mg/h ) Bolus Volume ( mL ) Bolus Dose ( mg ) Total Dose ( mg/h ) Basal Infusion 8 16 0 0 16 Bolus Doses 0 0 8 16 16 The tubing pumps subject gently wound least 5 rotation cover opaque tape , mask perineural catheter receive treatment ( ropivacaine clear , flow clear tube tape perineural catheter visually distinguishable ) . Local Anesthetic Administration . The infusion pump administer basal infusion initiate Hour 0 . The infusion pump administer bolus dos administer 8 mL bolus dose hour begin Hour 0 . Perineural catheter remove 8 hour . To check perineural catheter placement accuracy , adductor canal nerve block evaluate 8 hour local anesthetic initiation consider successful subject experience decrease sensation cold skin saphenous nerve distribution compare ipsilateral upper extremity . Subjects deem non-responders extremity fail exhibit increase tolerance cutaneous electrical current Hour 8 . For unsuccessful perineural catheter insertion , non-responders , perineural catheter inadvertently dislodge prior measurement primary endpoint , data include analysis subject drop study . Food Drink : Both food accompany beverages/water provide hospital serve nursing staff immediately follow catheter insertion . Meals provide without charge study subject . There restriction oral intake follow catheter insertion . Subjects remain within CTRI-CCR follow morning final measurement . Outcome Measurements . We select measure establish reliability validity . Staff blind treatment group assignment perform measure assessment . Measurements perform prior local anesthetic administration initiation ( `` baseline '' ; Hour 0 ) ; well hourly follow local anesthetic infusion/bolus initiation Hour 14 ( one final measurement set prior discharge follow morning approximately Hour 22 ; see Table ) . For measurement , dominant side always test first , followed contralateral side . Tolerance transcutaneous electrical stimulation : Evaluated seated position use transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TES ) manner describe throughout anesthesia literature ( `` gold standard '' regional anesthesia study ) .13-15 EKG pad position proximal patella quadriceps tendon 1 cm medial midline attach nerve stimulator . The current increase 0 mA subject report slight discomfort ( , maximum 80 mA ) , time current record TES value nerve stimulator turn . Quadriceps femoris muscle strength : Evaluated use portable isometric force dynamometer measure maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) seat position . The primary end point quadriceps femoris maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) express percentage pre-ropivacaine ( baseline ) MVIC : post / pre x 100 ; two side subject compare Hour 8.7,8,10 Statistical Analysis Plan . We assess noninferiority bolus method ( hourly 8 mL ropivacaine 0.2 % bolus dos ) compare basal infusion ( ropivacaine 0.2 % 8 mL/h continuous basal infusion ) primary endpoint tolerance cutaneous current 8 hour use 1-tailed t-test 0.025 significance level priori-specified noninferiority delta 10 mA . A value 10 mA determine priori small difference would clinically important group . This value consider minimally clinically-relevant current since approximates tolerate electrical current range baseline general population—in word , natural variability therefore relatively small amount current detect.17 A positive test noninferiority accompany 95 % confidence interval ( 0.025 hypothesize direction ) difference mean include noninferiority delta . Secondary analysis ass noninferiority bolus basal infusion method mean tolerance cutaneous current across time point measure , use noninferiority delta 10 mA . In repeated measure set , noninferiority assess context linear mixed model adjust within-subject correlation ( use auto-regressive correlation structure ) .16 If time-by-group interaction non-significant ( P &gt; 0.20 ) ass noninferiority collapse time construct 1-tailed t-test ( use noninferiority delta 10 mA ) base model-based treatment effect bolus versus basal infusion . In presence group-time interaction noninferiority assess separately time point Holm-Bonferroni correction make multiple comparison maintain hypothesis-wise type I error 0.025 . We also assess noninferiority bolus basal infusion secondary endpoint quadriceps femoris MVIC ( 22 hour total ) use mixed effect model describe . The rejection region noninferiority test include superiority , definition ( i.e. , `` bad '' implies either equivalent good ) . Therefore , bolus find noninferior , also superior , able claim superiority . This evidence 95 % CI difference mean fall zero . Although hypothesize bolus method noninferior basal infusion , possible basal infusion would noninferior bolus . Therefore , also conduct test assess noninferiority basal infusion bolus . If noninferiority find direction , claim equivalence ±10mA . SAS software 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) R software version 2.15.3 ( The R Foundation Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) use analysis . Sample Size Estimation . Sample size calculation base primary aim determine relationship perineural ropivacaine delivery technique ( basal vs. bolus ) continuous adductor canal nerve block effect . To end , perform noninferiority trial primary endpoint designate maximum tolerance transcutaneous electrical stimulation Hour 8 . With 24 subject approximately 90 % power ( 88 % ) 0.025 significance level detect noninferiority bolus ropivacaine basal infusion ropivacaine mean tolerance transcutaneous electrical stimulation Hour 8 use priori noninferiority delta 10 mA . Based previously-published data , conservatively assume standard deviation tolerance difference legs 15 mA.17,18 We apply analysis percent change baseline Hour 0 secondary outcome measure . We also examine time profile response time spaghetti mean plot . Further secondary analysis include mixed-effects model repeat hourly measure confirm analysis percent change 8 hour . These model account hierarchical correlation pair measure subject time . We use model test effect subject characteristic , include handedness , sex , height , weight , body mass index , age .</detailed_description>
