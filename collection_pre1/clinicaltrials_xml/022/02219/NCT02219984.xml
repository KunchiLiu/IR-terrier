	<detailed_description>Participants include patient 18 year satisfy follow preset criterion : - Participants include patient consecutively avoid selection bias ; criterion avoid selection bias propose Participants , decide one want adopt . - Patients receive anticoagulation therapy 30 day time inclusion , regardless age , clinical indication treatment , therapeutic range expect ( case treatment VKAs ) expect duration treatment ( provide duration least 3 month foreseen ) . Patients already receive chronic anticoagulation therapy time may include switch VKAs DOACs low molecular weight heparin fondaparinux - Patients prepared undergo constant monitoring enrol centre take part phase II III clinical study include . Patients participate observational phase IV study include Register . - All patient must give informed write consent -- follow procedure lay local Ethical Committees - compilation conservation Register 's central database data regard personal clinical history anticoagulation treatment pattern use say data . - All patient insert must follow least 1 year , even though indefinite follow-up patient continue anticoagulation therapy highly recommend . If single patient anticoagulation treatment discontinue within 1 year inclusion , active participate member nonetheless keep compiling ( telephonically ) information regard possible onset complication ( thrombotic , bleed clinical event another nature ) till 1 year -follow-up . - The Participants Register must use computer programme database - information collect . The computer programme must meet feature request Executive Committee Registry must able send information centralise database via internet connection web site . By way alternative Participants use `` Simple-START '' software provide free Registry . - As criterion safeguard privacy patient , every patient insert Registry identify `` Patient log '' include identification code enrol Participant identification code single patient , use computer database programme use Participant .
