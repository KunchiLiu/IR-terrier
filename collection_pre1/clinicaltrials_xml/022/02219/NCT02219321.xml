	<brief_summary>Prescription drug abuse represent major healthcare problem , treatment cost reach billion dollar annually United States alone . Today opioids commonly prescribe chronic non-cancer pain partially effective short-term pain relief . Whereas opioids initially part solution pain , eventually often turn problem patient chronic pain . Long-term treatment opioids complicate development tolerance , dependency , addiction , abnormal pain sensitivity , hormonal change , immune modulation . Unfortunately , chronic use anti-inflammatory drug associate marked increase adverse effect . The purpose study determine whether systemic administration lidocaine provide effective pain relief opioid dependent chronic pain patient . Investigators intend demonstrate lidocaine infusion improve pain relief physical function opioid dependent patient , thus improve compliance patient satisfaction , may potentially help wean patient narcotic . The long-term goal proposal decrease opioid dependence chronic pain patient use lidocaine infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lidocaine Infusion Chronic Pain Opioid Dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There significant disconnect escalate healthcare problem opioid use chronic pain , development novel therapeutic strategy . A plausible strategy interrupt vicious cycle pain , inflammation hyperesthesia use highly efficacious non-opioid drug require chronic administration , lidocaine . Lidocaine FDA approve local anesthetic , class 2 antiarrhythmic analgesic , antihyperalgesic anti-inflammatory property without reward addictive property . Intravenous lidocaine utilize since 1943 large spectrum pain condition . Lidocaine also show significantly reduce circulate inflammatory cytokine production . Investigators propose systemic administration lidocaine decrease intensity , duration pain opioid dependent chronic pain patient . The long-term goal proposal decrease opioid dependence chronic pain patient use lidocaine infusion . The central hypothesis lidocaine infusion decrease intensity pain opioid dependent chronic pain patient . Primary outcome : To determine short-term effect lidocaine infusion intensity pain opioid dependent chronic pain patient . Secondary outcome1 : Determine duration pain relief lidocaine infusion opioid dependent chronic pain patient . Investigators hypothesize lidocaine infusion long last Visual Analog Pain ( VAS ) score improvement extend beyond time infusion . This intermediate long-term pain relief demonstrate measure VAS pain score 3 time day 3 week reduction daily opioid use 25 % . Secondary outcome2 : Determine effect lidocaine infusion opioid induce hyperalgesia . Lidocaine infusion may decrease cytokine level acutely infusion compare baseline , well end 1 week infusion . STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION : Forty opioid dependent patient randomize double blind parallel placebo control study investigate effect lidocaine neuropathic pain . Patients meet inclusion criterion receive Initial laboratory work-up prior infusion date . Each patient receive Hepatic panel , CBC , Chemistry baseline cytokine level ( IL1b ) well baseline Cold Pressor Test ( CPT ) randomize either receive lidocaine placebo . Study Intervention : Lidocaine intravenous 2mg/kg initial bolus 5 minute follow continuous intravenous infusion lidocaine rate 2mg /kg /hour 4 hour versus saline volume duration . Duration study : Patient follow 3 week lidocaine infusion . Monitoring infusion : Heart rate , blood pressure , EKG , oxygen saturation , potential side effect sedation , circumoral numbness , metallic taste mouth continuously monitor record every 15 minute ( standard monitoring record time recovery area ) well pain score . After completion infusion patient monitor another 2 hr discharge meet standard discharge criterion accord Aldrete scoring system . Discharge instruction : Patients ask decrease daily opioid dose 25 % . Patients receive one-week supply short act opioid rescue medication . Patients ask use rescue medication pain moderate severe first day infusion . If improvement pain despite allowable short act medication report first day post infusion follow phone call , patient ask resume usual long act opioid dose . Each patient receive pain diary sheet record daily visual analogue pain score 3 time day well daily opioid dose plus counter analgesic requirement NSAIDS acetaminophen . Patients follow every week till study completion , pain diary , counter rescue pain medication assess . Outcome Measures : 1 . Visual Analog Pain ( VAS ) Scores 2 . Serum interleukin Ib level 3 . CPT 4 . Daily opioid use Subject Safety Data Monitoring : All subject carefully assess prior participation study , include medical history , laboratory test , examination board-certified physician ( Dr. Kandil ) . Subjects medical problem would increase risk participation exclude study . During infusion patient 's vital sign : heart rate , blood pressure , EKG , oxygen saturation , potential side effect sedation , circumoral numbness , metallic taste mouth continuously monitor record every 15 minute well pain score . All lidocaine/saline infusion supervise Dr. Enas Kandil , anesthesiologist . Dr. Kandil nurse attendance throughout infusion . Heart rate , include EKG rhythm strip , monitor continuously throughout infusion blood pressure obtain every 15 minute frequently indicate . If participant ' hemodynamics ( heart rate , blood pressure ) change 20 % ( typically consequence cardiac arrhythmia ) infusion stop . The serious toxic effect lidocaine ( e.g . unconsciousness , confusion , convulsion , respiratory arrest ) precede numbness tongue , lightheadedness , visual disturbance muscle twitching ; infusion terminate subject report latter sign symptom . A checklist sign symptom obtain every 15 minute . Subjects observe least two hour ( approximately one half-life lidocaine ) follow cessation lidocaine ( saline ) infusion . Dr. Kandil must approve discharge participant infusion study day . Lidocaine label carry warning precaution use patient various cardiac condition , notably conduction abnormality ( e.g. , heart block , QT prolongation ) . Cardiac condition identify EKG , medical history physical exam . Participants medical history cardiac disease ( e.g . myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia ) abnormal EKG ( include arrhythmia , heart block , QT prolongation ) exclude . Women positive pregnancy test report unprotected heterosexual sex since previous menses receive infusion . Women positive pregnancy test refer appropriate care . Subjects observe least two hour ( approximately one half-life lidocaine ) follow cessation lidocaine ( saline ) infusion . All participant receive 24-hour call-in number contact research staff advent problem .</detailed_description>
