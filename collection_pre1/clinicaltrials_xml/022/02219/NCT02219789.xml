	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alisertib give together fulvestrant treat patient hormone positive breast cancer spread part body spread start nearby tissue lymph node remove surgery . Alisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen progesterone type hormone make body cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen progesterone body make . Giving alisertib together fulvestrant may better treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib Fulvestrant Treating Patients With Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer That Metastatic Locally Advanced Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose alisertib combination fulvestrant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe safety tolerability alisertib combination fulvestrant . II . To examine tumor response postmenopausal woman treat alisertib combination fulvestrant . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess aurora A kinase expression archive breast cancer tissue biospecimens participant , describe level experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) objective response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 ( day 1 15 course 1 ) alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
