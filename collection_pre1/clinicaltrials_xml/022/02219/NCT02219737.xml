	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ibrutinib give together rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( combination chemotherapy ) treat patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) return period improvement ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , , rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ibrutinib together combination chemotherapy may better treatment patient relapse refractory DLBCL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety ibrutinib combination rituximab-ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( R-ICE ) . II . Establishment maximum tolerate dose ibrutinib R-ICE . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study ibrutinib combination R-ICE . II . Clinical response rate ibrutinib+R-ICE . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ibrutinib . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , ifosfamide IV day 3 , carboplatin intravenously piggy back ( IVPB ) day 3 , etoposide IVPB day 2-4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 52 week .</detailed_description>
