	<brief_summary>The PREHAB study clinical trial frail patient wait heart surgery randomly choose either receive current standard care participate 8-week exercise/education program community-based cardiac rehabilitation facility . Patients wait elective heart surgery long 3-4 month . During time , individual often fearful make thing bad , cause stop active deteriorate physical condition . This wait period present potential opportunity health care provider engage patient take control self-managed care prior surgery intent improve post-surgical outcome . Patients randomize PREHAB intervention group participate supervise exercise twice per week program design improve physical functioning exercise capacity . The investigator hypothesize PREHAB program frail elderly patient await elective cardiac surgery reduce frailty , improve exercise capacity , improve physical activity behaviour , improve in-hospital outcome , improve clinical outcome 3 month 1 year postoperatively , improve overall quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PREHAB three centre prospective , randomize , open , blind endpoint ( PROBE ) control trial use assessor blind intention-to-treat analysis . The study conduct three academic , tertiary care hospital ( St. Boniface Hospital , Winnipeg , MB , Montreal Heart Institute . Montreal QC Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre , Halifax , NS ) one non-academic hospital ( Saint John Regional Health Centre , Saint John , NB ) perform cardiac surgery . These site choose base similar patient population surgical waitlist time . Additionally , site partner one community-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) centre , certify medical fitness facility dedicate improve health community health promotion , disease prevention rehabilitation service . These facility offer expert guidance certify professional , innovative health enhancement program , provide integrated medical , rehabilitative fitness service . The investigator intend recruit total 244 participant study ( 122 per study arm ) , anticipate 20 % dropout rate achieve eventual sample size 194 participant . Patients PREHAB group receive , addition standard care , eight-week comprehensive exercise therapy education program community-based CR facility . This program target physical psycho-social-cognitive aspect cardiac disease frailty . In brief , participant require complete intake health status assessment CR team include physiotherapist , cardiovascular nurse , dietitian complete symptom-limited grade exercise stress test accord American College Sports Medicine Guidelines Exercise Testing Prescription 7th Edition . Patients ask complete least two session supervise , structure exercise class plus option attend one additional exercise class per week eight-weeks , progression moderate high-intensity interval program base supervised assessment patient 's capability . This show safe effective unrepaired heart failure elderly patient . PREHAB participant also attend four education session topic risk factor reduction , medication use , cardiovascular physiology , smoke cessation , healthy eating , exercise , stress management promotion self-managed care .</detailed_description>
