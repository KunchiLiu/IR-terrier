	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial investigate change pain intensity nociceptive gain processing application either physical therapy surgery woman carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . The purpose study determine change pain intensity , widespread pressure pain sensitivity segmental thermal change application physical therapy program base desensitization maneuver central nervous system endoscopic surgery woman CTS medium long-term follow-up period . We hypothesize physical therapy intervention target desensitization central nervous system effective surgical intervention modulating alter nociceptive gain processing woman CTS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nociceptive Gain Processing After Physical Therapy Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase evidence suggest carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) represent complex pain syndrome include peripheral central sensitization mechanism . In fact , patient unilateral CTS exhibit bilateral widespread pressure hyperalgesia bilateral pain hypersensitivity suggest presence alter nociceptive gain processing . In addition , sensitization process seem independent electro-diagnostic finding . Previous study support use physical therapy surgical intervention management pain disability patient . However , evidence relate change nociceptive gain process application therapeutic intervention . Preliminary evidence suggest manual therapy modulate sensitization mechanism . Therefore , objective conduct randomize clinical trial determine manual therapy include desensitization maneuver central nervous system effective decrease widespread pressure pain thermal pain hypersensitivity woman CTS .</detailed_description>
