	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate effectiveness drug call cabozantinib ( alone combination trastuzumab ) possible treatment advance breast cancer cancer spread brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib +/- Trastuzumab In Breast Cancer Patients w/ Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve cabozantinib specific disease approve us . Few treatment exist brain metastasis breast cancer . Radiation surgery generally include possible standard care treatment diagnosis . In research study , investigator look well cabozantinib work treat breast cancer spread brain . Cabozantinib use phase I study information research study suggest cabozantinib may help shrink stabilize participant 's breast cancer . In addition , information study show cabozantinib may pass blood brain barrier ( protective layer prevents large molecule cell find blood enter brain tissue ) may effective treatment brain metastasis . If participant HER2-positive breast cancer , receive trastuzumab addition cabozantinib . Trastuzumab FDA approve drug treatment HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer . However , combination cabozantinib trastuzumab yet test . Trastuzumab may help shrink stabilize breast cancer combination cabozantinib . If participant 's breast cancer HER2-negative , receive trastuzumab part clinical trial . The name study intervention involve study : - Cabozantinib ( XL184 ) - Trastuzumab ( herceptin ) ( participant HER2-positive disease )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer , stage IV disease . New progressive CNS lesion , assess patient 's treating physician . For patient receive prior cranial radiation , increase corticosteroid dose week prior baseline brain MRI Discontinued prior therapy ( exception trastuzumab patient HER2+ breast cancer ) Recovery baseline ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v.4.0 toxicity relate prior treatment , unless AE ( ) clinically nonsignificant and/or stable supportive therapy ; The subject ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients must normal organ marrow function laboratory value follow within 4 day first dose cabozantinib Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) Subjects childbearing potential must pregnant screening . Patients bisphosphonates may continue receive bisphosphonate therapy study . Patients want initiate bisphosphonate therapy may . The subject assessment know disease sit eg , computerized tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , bone scan appropriate , within 28 day first dose cabozantinib The subject receive cabozantinib another cMet inhibitor ( please note ARQ 197 consider MET inhibitor purpose study give data suggest inhibits tubulin ) The subject uncontrolled , significant intercurrent recent illness Leptomeningeal disease site CNS involvement Known contraindication MRI gadolinium contrast , cardiac pacemaker , shrapnel , ocular foreign body More 2 seizure last 4 week prior study entry Grade 1 high CNS hemorrhage baseline brain MRI , history grade 2 high CNS hemorrhage within 12 month The subject tumor contact , invade encase major blood vessel The subject evidence tumor invade GI tract ( esophagus , stomach , small large bowel , rectum anus ) , evidence endotracheal endobronchial tumor within 28 day first dose cabozantinib The subject require concomitant treatment , therapeutic dos , anticoagulant . Low dose aspirin ( ≤ 81 mg/day ) , lowdose warfarin ( ≤1 mg/day ) , prophylactic LMWH permit . The subject prothrombin time ( PT ) /INR partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) test ≥1.3 × laboratory ULN within 7 day first dose cabozantinib . Inability swallow intact tablet Diagnosis another malignancy within 2 year first dose cabozantinib , except superficial skin cancer , localize , low grade tumor deem cured treated systemic therapy Subjects clinically relevant ongoing complication prior radiation therapy eligible The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Subjects clinically relevant ongoing complication prior surgery eligible QTcF &gt; 500 msec average screen EKGs perform within 28 day first dose cabozantinib . Three EKGs must perform screening . If average three consecutive result QTcF &gt; 500 msec , subject ineligible . Active infection require IV antibiotic Day 1 cycle 1 No prior lapatinib within 7 day prior initiation protocol treatment Previously identify allergy hypersensitivity component cabozantinib formulation The subject require chronic concomitant treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer</criteria>
