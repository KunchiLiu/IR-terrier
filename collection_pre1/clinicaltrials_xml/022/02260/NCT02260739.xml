	<brief_summary>Recent advance hematology clearly illustrate simple `` clonal '' nature various hematological malignancy may really reflect reality malignant cell natural expansion . This nicely illustrated recent work AML example subclones coexist patient time , could also differentially expand time effect therapeutic intervention , also oncogenic spontaneous event ( 1 ) . These observation do recently next generation sequence allows discriminate tumor sample , different subclones analyse clonal architecture . Sequential analysis could help u identify first oncogenic event correlate disease progression emergence subclones . For reason major interest precisely understand architecture clone MPNs , especially understand initiate event initial event clone develop . In MPNs JAK2V617F initiate event , target expect extremely effective . If JAK2V617F secondary event target might allow alleviate MPN , may favor development malignant hemopathies .</brief_summary>
