	<brief_title>Preheated Skin Disinfection v Room-temperature Bacterial Colonization During Pace Device Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign preheat ( 36ᵒC , intervention ) skin disinfection ( Chlorhexidine 5mg/ml 70 % alcohol ) room temperature ( 20ᵒC , control ) skin disinfection ( Chlorhexidine 5mg/ml 70 % alcohol ) . Patient´s enrollment operation make external controller closer knowledge present study . All patient ask participate sequence arrive OR department study nurse present . Assignment take place directly patient consent . Patients stratify gender thereafter randomly allocate preheat control group , base computer-generated randomization list make independent statistician . Patients shower , scrub whole body hair twice 4 % chlorhexidine soap Descutan® ( Fresenius Kabi AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) prior surgery . patient prepared skin disinfection microbial sealant . Most patient elective arrive morning surgery hospital . Following standard procedure , intravenously administer antibiotic prophylaxis ( cloxacillin 2 g ) administrate ward 30 minute surgery . In OR patient wore disposable cap position operating table . The OR temperature 19°C upward displacement ventilation . Sterile disposable surgical gown ( Samutprakarn , Thailand/Mölnlycke Health Care AB , Göteborg , Sweden ) indicator glove ( Selangor , Malaysia/Mölnlycke Health Care AB Göteborg , Sweden ) wear surgeon OR nurse . Other OR staff ( n=2 ) wore cotton scrub , short-sleeved tunic shirt cuff arm , trouser cuff ankle . They also wear disposable helmet facemasks . Both group give skin disinfection 2 minute amount solution ( Chlorhexidine 5mg/ml 70 % alcohol ) . The skin disinfection ( Chlorhexidine 5mg/ml , alcohol ) store room-temperature measure keep 20ᵒC preheated store warm cupboard keep 36ᵒC . The participant disinfect cheek sternum accord routine procedure . Sterile material drape clothing single use . Cultures obtain four occasion use nylon flock swab ( Copan ESwab , Italia SpA ) : skin disinfection skin surface ; skin disinfection skin surface ; directly incision , completion incision , finally start closing suture . Swab culture rub 15 second slightly moist saline skin surface ( incision site ) . Swabs take wound rub along inside incision 15 second dry swab . Surgery perform two cardiologist . Cultures keep cold arrival Department Laboratory medicine , Clinical Microbiology . Cultures take care analyze accord specific protocol design especially study .</detailed_description>
