	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Blockade Post-Cardiac Arrest Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) occur 300,000 patient United States year estimate mortality great 90 % . Unfortunately , currently little offer term treatment supportive care post-cardiac arrest patient . Neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) sometimes utilized post-arrest patient particularly prevention shiver . However , usage NMB remain controversial current American Heart Association recommendation minimize utilization . Recent prospective randomize trial patient acute respiratory distress syndrome suggest mortality benefit NMB excellent safety profile . Furthermore , observational trial sepsis post-cardiac arrest show use NMB associate improved survival . Given , hypothesize continuous NMB beneficial post-arrest patient . In order test hypothesis , propose multi-center , randomize , open-label , phase II trial post-CA patient compare sustained NMB administration 24 hour standard care ROSC . We enroll adult , comatose OHCA patient return spontaneous circulation utilize already exist clinical trial network completion study . Patients randomize receive either rocuronium 24 hour receive placebo usual care . Previous data group suggest lactate level post-arrest patient good surrogate marker mortality . We therefore chosen utilize lactate level 24 hour primary endpoint current trial . Secondarily evaluate clinical endpoint include length stay , in-hospital mortality , good neurological outcome . We perform sub-study inflammatory marker oxygen consumption .</detailed_description>
