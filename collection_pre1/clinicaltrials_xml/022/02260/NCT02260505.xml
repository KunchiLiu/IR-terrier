	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study concern patient primary GIST follow Imatinib adjuvant treatment 3 year surgery high risk recurrence . In first arm , patient continue Imatinib treatment 3 year , allow determine continuation treatment efficient disease control , term Disease Free Survival improvement . In second arm , patient discontinue Imatinib treatment , standard practice . This arm allow determine re-introduction Imatinib relapse still efficient treatment control disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency Imatinib Treatment Maintenance Interruption After 3 Years Adjuvant Treatment Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GISTs ) rare mesenchymal neoplasm , mostly diagnose 55 60 year age , account 5 % sarcoma . Worldwide annual incidence approximately 12 case per million people , correspond approximately 800 new case per year France . A large majority GISTs harbour activate mutation proto-oncogene KIT and/or PDGFRA , cod cell-surface cytokine receptor tyrosine-protein kinase activity . Imatinib mesilate ( Glivec® , Novartis Pharma SAS ) selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor , lead inhibition KIT PDGFRA signal pathway . The introduction imatinib revolutionise therapeutic management GIST patient provide unprecedented demonstration clinical benefit target therapy patient advanced/metastatic solid tumor . First result prospective trial conduct imatinib GIST patient demonstrate 300 % increase median overall survival , likely 100 % increase 5 10-year survival compare cytotoxic chemotherapy . The successful use imatinib treatment advance GISTs significant risk recurrence advance GISTs prompt investigation clinical benefit imatinib post-operative adjuvant therapy . Two prospective randomize Phase III trial demonstrate adjuvant imatinib treatment significantly prolong overall survival ( OS ) recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) give 3 year . To date , imatinib also indicate adjuvant set complete resection primary , localize , KIT-positive GIST high risk recurrence . However , optimal treatment duration remain unclear determine whether 1. prolonged use adjuvant imatinib beyond 3 year may enable reduce risk GIST recurrence improve overall survival , 2. imatinib rechallenge efficient treat recurrence completion 3-year adjuvant imatinib therapy . This trial open-label , randomize , multicenter phase III study aim determine clinical impact maintain imatinib treatment beyond 3 year adjuvant set patient resect GISTs high risk recurrence accord National Comprehensive Cancer Network Task Force GIST ( NCCN ) risk classification .</detailed_description>

Risk tumor recurrence ≥ 35 % accord National Comprehensive Cancer Network Task Force GIST ( NCCN ) risk classification ( Demetri et al. , 2010 ) ( See Appendix 1 ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 Patients must imatinib treatment ( 300 400 mg/day ) initiate immediately resection maintain 3 year ( i.e . 36 month ± 3 month time randomization ) 3 consecutive month 6 month total interruption past 3 year . Patients must normal organ bone marrow function baseline define : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 G/L , platelet count ≥ 100 G/L , haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ) . Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ( upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( 5 x ULN case hepatic metastasis time reintroduction ) Adequate renal function assess least one following : 1 ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 2 ) creatinine clearance estimate ≥ 50 mL/min ( calculate accord CockcroftGault formula MDRD formula patient &gt; 65 year ) . Recovered prior antineoplasia treatmentrelated toxicity ( persistent treatmentrelated toxicity &lt; Grade 2 per Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v4 accept ) Women childbearing potential require negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior randomization . A positive urine test must confirm serum pregnancy test Patient must use effective contraception least 4 week prior study entry , study participation least 30 day posttreatment ( applicable woman nonchildbearing potential ) Ability understand willingness followup visit . Covered medical insurance . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient inform aspect trial prior enrolment . Pregnant breastfeed woman Patient concurrently use approve investigational antineoplastic agent Any contraindication imatinib treatment per Glivec® SPC Patient GIST harbor mutation D842V PDGFRA Major concurrent disease affect cardiovascular system , liver , kidney , haematopoietic system else consider clinically important investigator could incompatible patient 's participation trial would likely interfere study procedure result . Prior history malignancy study disease ( except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix ) unless patient free disease least 3 year . Patient receive concurrent treatment warfarin ( acceptable alternative : lowmolecular weight heparin ) prohibit concomitant and/or concurrent medication Patient Grade III/IV cardiac problem define New York Heart Association Criteria . ( i.e. , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month study ) Patient know diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection .
