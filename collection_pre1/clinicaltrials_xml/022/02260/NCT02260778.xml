	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Learning Collaborative effective tool improve adoption adherence Treat-to-Target ( TTT ) treatment strategy U.S. rheumatology practice treatment Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . The TTT strategy embrace American College Rheumatology RA Treatment Guidelines EULAR , however several line evidence suggest TTT practice consistently across rheumatology settings.Participating practice randomize receive Learning Collaborative intervention one two phase . Coaching consistent Learning Collaborative practice use promote adherence TTT . Chart abstraction use determine Learning Collaborative effective tool increase TTT adherence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twelve rheumatology practice around U.S. recruit participate Learning Collaborative ( LC ) . Eligible practice least 50 rheumatoid arthritis patient , least 2 rheumatologist , electronic medical record type note . Each practice randomize receive intervention either phase 1 ( first 9 month ) phase 2 ( second 9 month ) . The collaborative consist series 9 Learning Sessions ( 1 conduct face-to-face , remain conduct via webinar ) well regular coaching session collaborative session . The structure collaborative learning session focus resource , expertise , best practice address common barrier Treat-to-Target ( TTT ) adoption . The follow-up coaching collaborative session give provider opportunity reflect learn practice . The first Learning Session one-day face-to-face meeting consist orient team Model Improvement , describe Change Package content , conduct team building activity focus develop idea plan-do-study-act ( PDSA ) cycle , cross-team learning activity . ( The PDSA cycle refer test change , use four stage , perform part quality improvement process . ) The day primarily consist discussion session , several lecture TTT , disease activity measure , share decision making help orient team Change Package content . There ample time team get feedback expert faculty propose test change result date . Subsequent Learning Sessions conduct via webinar . We develop web-based collaborative tool Learning Collaborative . It help manage content share across team ( i.e. , key resource , PDSAs ) , display monthly improvement metric , provide discussion board conversation `` thread . '' The tool use Learning Sessions . Specific patient data never identify session Collaborative , specific patient data share participate provider . Providers able interact share general practice pattern behavior , sensitive patient information share . The intervention conduct 2 phase . In phase 1 , group 5practices [ Cohort 1 ] initiate collaborative , last 9 month . After 9 month , phase 2 begin remain practice [ Cohort 2 ] initiate second collaborative content cohort 1 , second collaborative also take 9 month complete . The cohort 1 cohort 2 collaborative group interaction , cohort 2 serve concurrent control cohort 1 first 9 month intervention . De-identified data collect participate site compare TTT practice prior follow Learning Collaborative intervention use chart review abstraction tool . The tool four item : 1 ) documentation treatment target ; 2 ) documentation share decision making ; 3 ) documentation disease activity measure ; 4 ) evidence information guide treatment decision . This tool use grade visit two month immediately prior start Phase 1 visit two month immediately prior end Phase 1 ; change score baseline follow-up calculate . The range change implementation TTT vary -4 ( worsen 4 baseline 0 follow-up ) +4 ( improvement 0 baseline 4 follow-up ) . Thus , range change score -4 +4 , 9-point ordinal scale . The baseline visit consider patient visit within two month start Phase 1 ( January 2015 ) . If multiple visit time-frame , note visit proximal January 2015 ( start study ) assess . The end Phase 1 visit consider visit within two month November 1 , 2015 . Again , multiple visit time-frame , note visit proximal October 1 , 2015 assess . When assess performance site , randomly sample medical record patient RA visit document within two time-frames . Surveys also collect patient provider assess satisfaction patient-provider interaction share decision-making . RA patient randomly select site complete questionnaire rating satisfaction share decision-making process use three item collaboRATE scale . This carried start Phase I re-assessed end Phase 1 . Similarly , ask provider involve Learning Collaborative sit group complete modify version questionnaire ; also re-assessed end Phase 1 . During Phase 2 , outcome plan assess primary outcome TTT implementation well patient collaboRATE scale . The primary analysis compare primary outcome among Learning Collaborative site control sit . The mean change implementation TTT Learning Collaborative arm compare implementation TTT control arm accounting intra-cluster correlation use linear mixed model . Although normality assumption may violate outcome variable ordinal , linear mixed model still valid propose sample size . Treatment arm exposure interest . Covariates include model include provider-level characteristic ( age , gender , train ) , patient-level characteristic ( age , gender , baseline disease activity , baseline RA drug ) , covariates found unbalanced baseline . While characteristic balance give random assignment treatment arm , small number center arm open possibility baseline difference thus rationale adjustment . Similarly , secondary outcome ( dichotomous variable ) , use generalize linear mixed model binary outcome . The trial power base primary outcome - estimate difference change TTT implementation Learning Collaborative intervention control sit . Several assumption underpin sample size estimation . First , control group would small change ( 0-5 % ) change implementation TTT compare change intervention group 20-40 % , improvement level observe similar prior trial use Learning Collaborative . Second , include 5 site intervention group , 6 control group . We assume average number provider practice 5 , expect would substantial intra-cluster correlation ( ICC ) among patient within give provider . We conservatively assume range ICC 0.1-0.3 base prior work . Third , significant level ( alpha ) would two-sided 0.05 , goal power would 80 % . Based assumption , estimate sample size propose trial . The required number patient per provider need detect meaningful difference calculate set assumption . Based estimate , review random 6 patient per provider eligible visit ensure adequate sample size achieve 80 % power .</detailed_description>
