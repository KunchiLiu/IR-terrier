	<brief_summary>Background : The prevalence senile cardiac amyloidosis ( CA ) aortic stenosis ( AS ) markedly increase age . Aortic stenosis increase leave ventricular pressure overload . Cardiac deposit observe AS amount deposit correlate post-surgical outcome . As strong echocardiographic cardiac MRI imaging similarity CA AS , investigator hypothesize deposit observe AS transthyretin amyloid deposit . The investigator objective demonstrate amyloid deposit associate poor outcome follow aortic stenosis surgical valve replacement . Materiel method : 180 patient indication surgical aortic valve replacement recruit prospectively consecutively 5 French center . A replicative study perform one Austrian center . Echocardiography , cardiac MRI bone scintigraphy perform prior surgery . During surgery , basal LV septum biopsy collect determination quantification interstitial deposit use specific stain performed blind fashion . Clinical outcome record hospitalization period follow surgery 1 year . Alive re-hospitalization status determine . Patients classify accord presence amyloid deposit . Expected result impact : This study emphasize pressure overload stress accelerate magnifies amyloid deposition usually know related cardiac age process . It develop reliable imaging tool marker detect cardiac amyloid deposition . Correlation anatomopathologic analysis three different image technics identify accurate imaging marker CA . A risk stratification model base amyloid deposit level clinical management patient create combine image biological marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain major cause mortality morbidity industrialised country . Their prevalence increase steeply consequence age population country . Curiously , cardiovascular neurodegenerative disease share common age pathological pathway involve abnormal accumulation insoluble amyloid protein extracellular matrix disrupt normal organ function . Whereas neurological amyloid diseases considerably investigate , little attention pay aggregation amyloid proteins cardiovascular disease . Post-mortem study identify cardiac wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis deposition 25 % individual age 80 year lead concept `` senile cardiac amyloidosis '' ( CA ) ( Cornwell , Am j Med 1984 ; Pitkanen , Am J Pathol 1984 ) . The cause deposition yet know might relate primarily age process enhance cardiac mechanical stress ( overload ) , hypoxia , oxidative stress inflammation . Since patient transthyretin CA develop severe heart failure poor prognosis , crucial identify especially among population risk aortic stenosis ( AS ) . Indeed common valvular heart disease affect mainly senescent subject combine adverse effect myocardial function pressure overload myocardial age . Interestingly , elderly patient severe AS exhibit similar echocardiographic cardiac MRI pattern report CA include increased cardiac wall thickness progressive leave ventricular dysfunction start alteration basal LV-2D strain . They also exhibit increased late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) cardiac MRI . This interpreted related interstitial myocardial `` fibrosis '' correlate poor prognosis aortic valve replacement i.e . ; high mortality , persistence heart failure symptom LV dysfunction ( Weidemann Circ 2009 ; Dweck , JACC 2011 ; Hermann JACC 2011 ) . However none patient benefit detailed histology analysis aim identify amyloid deposit . The investigator recently find similar clinical observation investigator AS cohort . Using specific staining , investigator able unmask association severe AS CA patient . These preliminary finding raise question potential pathophysiological link CA AS might explain patient AS may benefit cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
