	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer , 70,000 new case 8900 deaths year France , major public health problem . Until 28 % patient treat surgery present positive surgical margin result incomplete clearance tumoral process expose patient local , systemic recurrence increase morbidity . An increase number international publication show ( ICG ) interest detection sentinel lymph node , surgery tumor type hepatocarcinoma liver metastases colorectal disease , also surgery kidney , bladder breast . ICG affinity tumor tissue around tumor relate micro-vascular histology localize specific deposit ( EPR effect ) . The detection ICG 's deposit possible use device allow visualize infra-red fluorescence ( NIR ; Near Infra-Red ) object large 0.15 mm . Thanks feature , location residual tumor tissue perform radical prostatectomy could make much easy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ability ICG detect surgical margin positive intraoperatively never evaluate . We want perform monocentric prospective ex-vivo pilot order evaluate diagnostic performance fluorescence detection surgical margin compare pathologic analysis . This study conduct 37 patient operated radical prostatectomy systemic injection 0 , 25 mg/Kg ICG 24 h surgery . The fluorescence analysis perform operation room specimen send laboratory analysis usual . Two piece prostate prelevated accord protocol . The histopathological procedure perform without knowledge fluorescence analysis . Except ICG injection medical procedure wo n't change .</detailed_description>
