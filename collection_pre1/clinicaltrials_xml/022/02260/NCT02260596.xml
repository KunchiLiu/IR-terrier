	<detailed_description>The purpose study 1 ) Determine incidence respiratory viral infection diagnose first year post SOT HSCT ; 2a ) Determine all-cause mortality within 3 month respiratory viral infection diagnose inpatient admission first year post SOT HSCT ; 2b ) Determine proportion death within 3 month respiratory viral infection diagnose inpatient admission deem directly attributable infection ; 3 ) To identify factor know time onset inpatient respiratory viral infection associate all-cause mortality . The study cohort consist SOT HSCT recipient â‰¤18 year age receive transplant January 1st , 2010 June 30th , 2013 . Th cohort determine incidence respiratory viral infection diagnose inpatient admission first year post-transplant . A sub-cohort patient develop respiratory viral infection within one year transplantation leveraged investigate factor associate mortality 3 month respiratory viral infection . Baseline demographic characteristic summarize standard descriptive summary . Categorical variable summarize frequency continuous variable summarize use mean , standard deviation and/or median , twenty-fifth seventy-fifth percentile , minimum , maximum . This minimal risk study use data collect retrospectively medical chart . The potential risk would loss confidentiality .</detailed_description>
