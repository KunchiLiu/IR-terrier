	<brief_summary>Every patient undergo surgery abdomen experience temporary paralysis bowel function . This study evaluate whether chew gum reduce bowel paralysis surgery patient undergo either esophageal resection whipples procedure . Half study population receive chew gum half act control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Chewing Gum Postoperative Bowel Function Following Upper GI Tract Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every surgical procedure result temporary paralysis bowel function . This condition name postoperative ileus ( POI ) characterize absence intestine motility , accumulation gas fluid inside intestine absence flatus defecation . It result nausea , vomit , abdominal distension , pain lower tolerance towards intake fluid solid food . POI organism 's reaction surgical trauma often single important factor determine length patient admission . Prolonged POI also result medical complication . The length POI follow elective abdominal surgery often 3 6 day . Gradually period intestine regain normal behavioral pattern . The colon last segment regain motility decide patient 's wellbeing . Therefore investigation POI measure time surgery first flatus defecation . The cause POI find surgical trauma . When abdominal wall peritoneum penetrate intestine expose handle , immune system activate . The immune system create inflammatory response inhibit local neural pathway intestine . The size immune response relate size surgical procedure length POI . Together overall hormonal surgical stress response inflammatory response create shift autonomous nervous system towards sympathetic domination . This inhibit bowel activity . The intake food activates parasympathetic activity promote bowel activity . Early food intake follow abdominal surgery , however , often ill receive patient hence mention symptom POI . The early food intake also worsen complication follow surgery anastomotic leakage . This pronounced anastomose esophagus stomach . Therefore abstinence food intake often recommend immediate postoperative period . Chewing chew gum follow surgery perceive placebo intake food also activate parasympathetic nervous system normal condition cephalic part digestion . Gum chewing , however , result worsen potential surgical complication generally well tolerated patient . Postoperative gum chewing investigate found effect full shape reduce POI follow colorectal surgery , abdominal surgery aorta , bladder surgery , caesarian section . The effect gum chew follow surgery esophagus pancreas knowledge yet investigate . With study wish investigate effect gum chew POI patient population undergo either esophageal resection pancreaticoduodenectomy ( whipples procedure ) due cancer either esophagus pancreas .</detailed_description>
