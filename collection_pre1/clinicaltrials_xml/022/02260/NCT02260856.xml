	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial epiphysiodesis technique : percutaneous transphyseal screw epiphysiodesis versus percutaneous drill epiphysiodesis correction leg length discrepancy . The primary outcome mean physeal growth follow epiphysiodesis , 6 month . Secondary outcome include fluoroscopy surgical time , physeal growth additional time point 2 year , pain , knee function , return activity , quality life , complication , need additional surgical procedure cost . A cost-effectiveness analysis follow completion RCT . The author hypothesize mean growth treat physis significantly low follow drill epiphysiodesis compare screw epiphysiodesis , measure 6 month screw epiphysiodesis short length hospital stay , short fluoroscopy OR time , few day modify weight bearing , less time full weight bearing , less pain , less time return sport , high quality life , high knee function drill epiphysiodesis . Additionally , author hypothesize screw epiphysiodesis expensive due secondary surgery remove implant screw epiphysiodesis preferred patient due less pain , good outcome , short time hospital , few day modify weight-bearing.The result study expect improve outcomes child undergo epiphysiodesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tantalum bead implant permit accurate reliable measurement growth epiphysiodesis . Although plain x-rays standard method clinical practice assess growth follow epiphysiodesis , technique present difficulty , possible determine whether growth limb follow epiphysiodesis distal proximal physis . { { 96 Blair , V.P.,3rd 1982 } } , { { 98 Little , D.G . 1996 } } . Attempting assess success epiphysiodesis plain radiograph require multiple assumption ( assumption regard proportion growth physis , growth rate , age final growth ) , multiple assumption come multiple opportunity error . Tantalum bead facilitate direct measurement growth follow epiphysiodesis . Tantalum bead successfully use adult child { { 12 Lauge-Pedersen , H . 2006 } } , although require implantation small radio-opaque bead , consider gold standard make detailed radiographic measure , optimal technique physeal growth measurement . { { 12 Lauge-Pedersen , H . 2006 } } { { 13 Haugan , K . 2012 } } . Over 300 000 bead insert vivo without significant complication . To date , tantalum bead use accurately assess growth follow screw epiphysiodesis . Although outcome drill screw epiphysiodesis exist { { 10 Campens , C . 2010 ; 11 Ghanem , I . 2011 } } , assessment retrospective non-randomized series , may risk selection bias , may adequately capture outcomes interest , depend data routinely collect documented medical chart . To knowledge , prospective randomize comparison epiphysiodesis technique clinical outcome publish accurately assess effective technique disable growth physis , take account patient-centered outcome cost . Operative measure surgical time radiation exposure intra-operative fluoroscopy previously compare . Utilization functional outcome time full weight-bearing , return school , knee function pedi-IKDC previously assess population . The propose research study aim fill gap . By randomized control trial , clinical effectiveness cost effectiveness drill screw epiphysiodesis assess . When select technique epiphysiodesis , important factor reliable procedure gain desired effect : obliteration growth physis . This important failure completely disrupt growth may result angular deformity ongoing length discrepancy , may require secondary surgery negative effect function quality life . Secondary factor may use select epiphysiodesis technique include complication , procedure time , radiation exposure , pain , hospital stay , return weight bearing activity , quality life . The assessment cost associate technique previously document . A cost- effectiveness analysis conduct end study order evaluate cost utility balance procedures.We use advance decision analysis technique determine overall best method epiphysiodesis incorporate cost data well data clinical recovery outcomes . This study add valuable clinical information expect change surgeon technique preference epiphysiodesis . Further , patient well understand expect follow type surgery , ultimately benefit improved clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
