	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study target approximately 100 men age 18 biochemical relapse evidence relapse prostate cancer primary treatment . The purpose study : A . Provide expand access drug 11C-choline . B . Determine performance characteristic ( sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value ) 11C-choline PET/Computed Tomography ( CT ) PET/Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) detection metastatic prostate cancer patient biochemical relapse prostate cancer primary treatment prospective manner . C. Determine optimal Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) trigger value 11C-choline PET/CT PET/MRI positive patient prospective study . D. Determine factor predict confirm positive 11C-choline PET/CT PET/MRI use multivariable analysis clinical pathologic data collect prospectively . E. Compare individual performance characteristic 11C-choline PET/CT 11C-choline PET/MRI combination 11C-choline PET/CT PET/MRI Study Protocol : 1 . Patients enter study undergo 11C-choline PET CT scan MRI scan . 2 . The CT MRI image evaluate evidence metastatic prostate cancer . 3 . The 11C-choline PET CT MRI image evaluate evidence metastatic prostate cancer . 4 . Evidence metastasis conventional image 11C-choline PET confirm biopsy surgical pathology possible , response treatment subsequent imaging . 5 . Rates confirm metastasis conventional CT MRI image compare 11C-choline PET CT MRI image . 6 . Upon conclusion image protocol , refer physician receive write documentation result . At time , patient consider study follow require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . The study consist patient biochemical relapse evidence relapse primary treatment . This study group consist patient treat radiation therapy , androgen suppression radiation therapy PSA &gt; 2 ng/mL high nadir level . The nadir level patient treat androgen suppression radiation therapy determine serum testosterone level normalize . This study group also consist patient treat radical prostatectomy biochemical relapse define PSA 0.2 ng/mL confirm level higher subsequent PSA test 3 month later . This group may consist men clinical evidence relapse suspicious bone scan CT scan regardless PSA kinetics . Patients identified potential subject screen eligibility criterion define Section 4.1 . 2 . Informed consent obtain participant study related procedure conduct . Each participant inform nature study , purpose , possible risk . Informed consent document use write informed consent document approve local IRB Decatur Memorial Hospital . 3 . At time referral , patient ask bring prior record pertains prostate cancer history . Data collect outside record , radiographic study , previous image study biopsy incorporate study record . 4 . Abstracted data study record include : 1 . Patient demographic age , race , family history prostate cancer 2 . Risk factor finasteride dutasteride use , environmental exposure ( eg . Agent orange ) 3 . Prostate exam result , recent within last 90 day 4 . PSA test result , current past 5 . Past medical surgical history 6 . Current medication 7 . Allergies 8 . Pathology report 9 . Imaging report 10 . Date diagnosis 11 . Date ( ) biochemical relapse coordinate PSA result . Once record assess eligibility , order 11C-choline PET CT scan MRI scan request refer physician patient schedule give appropriate prep instruction . 5 . Patients enter study undergo 11C-choline PET CT scan MRI scan . The CT scan perform intravenous contrast unless deem unsafe lab value . The CT MRI image evaluate evidence metastatic prostate cancer . The 11C-choline PET CT MRI image evaluate evidence metastatic prostate cancer . Unequivocal evidence metastasis conventional image 11C-choline PET consider true positive . Evidence metastasis conventional image 11C-choline PET confirm biopsy surgical pathology possible , response treatment subsequent imaging . If confirmation metastasis achievable biopsy surgical pathology , confirmation achieve 11C-choline PET CT MRI image obtain 3 month treatment conclusion . Rates confirm metastasis conventional CT MRI image compare 11C-choline PET CT MRI image . 6 . Upon conclusion image protocol , refer physician receive write documentation result . At time , patient consider study follow require .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . For biochemical relapse primary treatment 1 . PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/ml radical prostatectomy confirm level higher subsequent test 3 month later 2 . PSA increase &gt; 2 ng/ml nadir follow radiation therapy 3 . PSA increase &gt; 2 ng/ml nadir follow radiation therapy plus androgen deprivation therapy nadir define normalized testosterone level 4 . Two consecutive PSA increase nadir level androgen blockade androgen suppression therapy 2 . Kidney function GFR &gt; 60 mL/sec/1.73m2 Creatinine &lt; 1.7mg , collect within 90 day plan scan 1. GFR &gt; equal 60 mL/sec/1.73m2 , PET/CT complete contrast 2. GFR &lt; 60 mL/sec/1.73m2 , PET/CT complete without contrast 3. Creatinine &gt; 1.7 mg , Radiology follow ACR recommendation outline department policy . 3 . No known allergy iodinate radiologic contrast medium 4 . Able MRI base screen evaluation . If patient find MRI incompatible , 11Ccholine PET/MRI portion study complete . Please see provide contact number option . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 1 . ECOG Performance Status &gt; 2 . 2 . Concurrent malignancy , i.e . colon cancer . 3 . Treatment another malignancy except superficial skin cancer within 5 year</criteria>
