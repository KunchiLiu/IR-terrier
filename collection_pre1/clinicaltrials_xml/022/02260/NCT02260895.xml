	<brief_summary>Diabetes major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Prevention diabetes important goal . The progression impair glucose tolerance diabetes think promote toxic effect hyperglycemia pancreatic beta cell . One main defect cause postprandial hyperglycemia individual impair glucose tolerance reduce first phase ( immediate ) insulin release . The investigator hypothesis consume nutritional preload -- low-calorie , nutritionally balance snack -- 30 minute ingest carbohydrate load , moderate hyperglycemic response subsequent carbohydrate challenge reduce glucotoxicity stimulate insulin release synthesis . The aim study test hypothesis compare standard 75-gram , two-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) response 30 fasting adult impair glucose tolerance OGTT response test precede ½ ounce ( 14 gram ) dry-roasted , unsalted almond . A pre-load interval 30 minute choose peak phase 2 ( delay ) insulin response pre-load ( 45-60 minute ) would coincide timeframe steep OGTT rise glucose ( 15 30 minute post challenge ) . The investigator hypothesize one-hour OGTT glucose level approximately 40 mg/dl low participant consume pre-OGTT almond snack , compare one-hour glucose level standard two-hour OGTT . The two-hour OGTT glucose level unlikely show statistically significant difference almond pre-test snack control standard OGTT condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct Physicians Sugar Creek ( PSC ) —the model family practice center Memorial Family Medicine Residency Program . The ethnicity PSC patient approximately 30 % non-Hispanic white , 30 % Hispanic , 30 % African-American , 10 % Asian . Potential participant identify search PSC electronic medical record ( Centricity ) find adult age 18-75 impaired glucose tolerance , without diabetes ( one-hour oral glucose tolerance test result &gt; 160 md/dl two-hour OGTT result &lt; 200 mg/dl ) , without hypoglycemic medication corticosteroid active medication list , without almond allergy allergy list . Recruitment flyer post clinic encourage interested individual contact investigator potential study eligibility . The investigator also approach previously identify potentially eligible patient routine clinical visit clinic , elicit interest participate study . Those express interest schedule intake visit investigator , ascertain eligibility invite eligible individual take part study . Interested eligible individual render verbal write informed consent instruct study protocol schedule first data gather visit . Each participant schedule undergo two 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , start 7:00 9:30 a.m. , one four week apart . Test A standard 75-gram OGTT . Test B OGTT begin 30 minute ingestion low-carbohydrate pre-load `` snack '' consist 1/2 oz ( 14 gram ) unsalted , dry-roasted almond ( 12 average size almond ) . Each participant give 8-ounce glass water drink almond . Participants randomize one two test sequence ( A-B B-A ) , control sequence effect result . To minimize variability OGTT result , participant ask eat usually throughout study . Participants ask refrain vigorous physical activity 8 hour prior OGTT minimize physical activity OGTT . Participants complete Perceived Stress Scale 24-hour food , alcohol , activity recall day OGTT analyze potential confounding effect stress , diet , alcohol , physical activity result . Blood sample do serial measurement plasma glucose time-zero , 60-minute interval two hour 75-gram glucose load . An investigator monitor time blood draw closely ensure timeliness . Blood draw one two phlebotomist on-site laboratory send Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital Quest Lab ( latter control OGTT , patient whose insurance require ) analysis . The glucose result report electronically patient 's medical record routine manner blood test result . Investigators abstract glucose result patient ' electronic medical record data analysis purpose . The primary dependent variable mean difference plasma glucose ( fast 1-hr post 75-g glucose challenge , vs. without snack . The secondary dependent variable mean difference plasma glucose ( fast 2-hr post 75-g glucose challenge , vs. without snack ) . Student 's test use analyze difference standard 75-g OGTT result OGTT result follow almond pre-test snack . Analysis variance use analyze data confound effect ethnicity , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , pre-test food alcohol intake , physical activity , perceive stress level . Patients receive individual result investigator-generated evaluative commentary routine `` lab letter '' . The result letter forward patient 's primary care provider review appropriate clinical follow-up . Patients ' result communicate scientifically aggregate manner , individual identifying information , maintain patient confidentiality .</detailed_description>
