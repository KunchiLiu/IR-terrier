	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate long-term safety tolerability JNJ-54861911 6 month treatment participant early ( predementia ) alzheimer 's disease ( AD [ degenerative disease brain characterize insidious onset dementia , impairment memory , judgment , attention span , problem solve skill follow severe apraxia global loss cognitive ability ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study JNJ-54861911 Participants With Early Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , multi-center ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , parallel-group study . The study consist 3 Parts ; Screening Phase 90 day , double-blind Treatment Phase 6 month Follow-up Phase 7 28 day follow last dose Month 6 . Eligible participant early ( predementia ) AD spectrum randomize either Treatment group 1 , 2 placebo participant previously participate study 54861911ALZ1005 enrol study receive treatment study 54861911ALZ1005 . The study duration participant approximately 10 month . Blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample collect evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics JNJ-54861911 , well amyloid beta fragment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study , include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cognitive measure .</detailed_description>

If abnormality , must consistent underlie illness study population potential cause cognitive impairment , write concurrence sponsor 's medical monitor Before randomization , woman must childbearing potential : postmenopausal ( great equal [ &gt; = ] 50 year age amenorrhea least 12 month ; permanently sterilize [ e.g. , tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy ] ) ; otherwise incapable pregnancy . In case questionable status qualify personal sponsor consult decide potential inclusion participant Participant evidence brain disease , potential early sign AD ( e.g . mild hippocampal atrophy ) typical agerelated change ( e.g . mild white matter hyperintensity magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) abnormality ( e.g . folic acid/Vitamin B12 deficiency ) could explain possible cognitive deficit ( include , limited vascular encephalopathy stroke include lacuna 's ( imaged cerebral MRI ) Major Depression ( define current Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) criterion ) Participant evidence familial autosomal dominant AD . ( Inclusion make upon write confirmation sponsor , mutation know deem modulating Betasecretase [ BACE ] cleavage ) Participant history presence significant depression define current DSM criterion Participant clinically significant abnormal physical neurological examination , vital sign screen baseline ( Day 1 predose ) Participant history current liver renal insufficiency ; clinically significant cardiac , vascular , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , endocrine , hematologic , rheumatologic , psychiatric , metabolic disturbance ( e.g . unstable situation need monitor regular dose adaptation )</criteria>
