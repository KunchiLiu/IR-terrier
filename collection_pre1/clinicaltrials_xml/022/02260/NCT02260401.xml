	<detailed_description>LESS trial participant randomize receive individualized outcome report 18-month interview 24-month follow . Both group ask rank outcome domain importance , answer question regard belief receive future treatment spinal stenosis complete standard self-reported outcome questionnaire . In addition , ask study participant whether information present individualized report helpful deciding future epidural injection treatment well content report easy understand . At 24 month , repeat interview outcomes assessment . We compare group term response determine lasting difference patient receive individualized report make decision regard future treatment respond self-reported outcome question . In addition , compare healthcare utilization two group 18 month 24 month determine provide individualized outcome report change treatment utilization ( i.e. , people receive report undergo few subsequent injection treatment pain ? ) . We hypothesize provide individualize report allow patient make informed choice regard subsequent treatment , lead reduce use ineffective treatment improve outcomes overall .</detailed_description>
