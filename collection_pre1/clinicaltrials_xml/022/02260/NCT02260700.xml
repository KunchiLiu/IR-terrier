	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Bioavailability , Food Effect , Safety Tolerability Solid Dosage Formulation JNJ-54861911 Healthy Older Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-center , single-dose 3-way Crossover ( medication provide participant different sequence ) study determine bioavailability JNJ-54861911 solid dosage formulation healthy old male participant . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase ( , 28 day study commences Day 1 ) , open-label treatment Phase ( consist 3 single-dose treatment period , either single oral suspension formulation [ Treatment A ] solid formulation 25 milligram ( mg ) dose JNJ-54861911 fast [ Treatment B ] feed condition [ Treatment C ] subsequent 3-treatment period ; treatment period separate washout period 6 day ) follow-up Phase ( 7 14 day last dose administration ) . The maximal study duration participant exceed 8 week . All eligible participant randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence . Followed overnight fast least 10 hour participant administer study treatment fast condition feed condition ( 30 minute high-fat , high-calorie breakfast ) . Participants allow food 4 hour drug administration . Blood sample collect evaluation pharmacokinetics pre-dose post-dose study treatment . Bioavailability primarily evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
