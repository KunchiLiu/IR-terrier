	<criteria>1 . Males females ≥ 18 year old nonchild bearing potential child bear potential committing consistent correct use acceptable method birth control 2 . Subjects reliable clinical history asthma document least 12 week prior screen 3 . Subjects prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; 40 % &lt; 85 % predict value screen visit first day treatment 4 . Subjects currently nonsmoking use tobacco product ( i.e. , cigarette , cigar , pipe tobacco ) within past year , &lt; 10 packyears historical use 5 . Subjects &gt; 15 % reversibility FEV1 within 30 minute follow 360 mcg albuterol inhalation ( pMDI ) . Note : This test may repeat different day patient fail first attempt ; patient achieves least 10 % reversibility Investigator think second attempt appropriate 6 . Subjects able discontinue asthma medication ( inhaled corticosteroid longacting beta agonist ) runin period remainder study 7 . Subjects able replace current shortacting beta agonist ( SABAs ) salbutamol/albuterol inhaler use need duration study ( subject able withhold inhale SABAs least 6 hour prior lung function assessment study visit ) 8 . Subjects able continue follow medication without significant adjustment dosage , formulation , dose interval duration study , judge able investigator withhold specify minimum time interval prior clinic visit : shortacting form theophylline 12 hour , twiceaday control release form theophylline 24 hour , onceaday controlledrelease form theophylline 36 hour 9 . Subjects able discontinue follow medication specify minimum time interval prior runin period remainder study : oral parenteral corticosteroid 1 month oral shortacting beta agonist 12 hour 10 . Subjects able willing give write informed consent participate study . ********************************************************** 11 . Female Subjects pregnant breastfeed 12 . Subjects lifethreatening asthma last 10 year , define history asthma episode ( ) require intubation , and/or associate hypercapnoea ; respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure , asthmarelated syncopal episode ( ) , hospitalization within past year runin period 13 . Subjects evidence history clinically significant disease abnormality include congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , cardiac dysrhythmia . In addition , historical current evidence significant hematologic , hepatic , neurologic , psychiatric , renal , diseases opinion investigator , would put patient risk study participation , would affect study analysis disease exacerbate study 14 .
