	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Temocillin beta-lactam antibiotic active Gram-negative bacteria . Its spectrum cover family member Enterobacteriaceae ( include many produce beta-lactamase ) , Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria spp 1,2 , Pseudomonas . It currently license use septicemia , urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) , low respiratory tract infection.3 There also evidence clinical efficacy treatment biliary tract infection adults.4,5 Temocillin biliary level several times-fold superior serum concentration patient cholelithiasis , although also characterise high interindividual variation.6,7 In addition , prolong half-life ( 4.5-5 hour ) Gram-negative spectrum make temocillin particularly suit treatment hepatobiliary infections.5 One study document efficacy temocillin indication ( 16 patient biliary tract infection ; daily dose 2g temocillin ) .7 The interest molecule greatly enhance recent year due increase incidence infection cause organisms produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) , make become sparing-drug carbapenems.8-10 Temocillin present MICs range 2 32 mg/L Enterobacteriaceae , include ESBL producers.1,2 Like beta-lactam antibiotic , time MIC free drug concentration ( ƒT &gt; MIC ) important PK-PD parameter correlate efficacy.11 When beta-lactam antibiotic concentration exceed MIC 40 % 50 % dose interval , efficacy beta-lactam antibiotic compromise . When cut-off ƒT &gt; MIC 40 % use , Monte-Carlo simulation available data defines clinical PK/PD breakpoint 8 16 mg/L temocillin.11-13 The available temocillin pharmacokinetics data ( distribution , metabolism , elimination ) come study perform adult . It mainly excrete unchanged ( 80 % ) urine glomerular filtration tubular secretion.3 Little known dose elimination temocillin child . The summary product characteristic temocillin proposes daily dose 25 - 50 mg/kg paediatric use,14 study back-up recommendation . This dose probably arise scaling-down typical adult daily dose 2-4 g assume adult weight 70kg . In literature , use temocillin paediatrics refers mainly clinical efficacy treatment urinary tract infections.15,16 In present hospital , temocillin also use treatment suspicion cholangitis cirrhotic paediatric patient , antibiotic prophylaxis follow hepatic transplant child ( off-label indication ) . There , therefore , press need explore pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics temocillin paediatric population , order provide clear guidance appropriate dose regimen . 2 . Study Objectives 1 . Characterisation pharmacokinetics ( PK ) temocillin ( total free concentration ) 3 paediatric population : 1. child require antibiotic treatment urinary tract infection 2. cirrhotic child require antibiotic treatment due suspicion cholangitis 3. child require antibiotic prophylaxis follow hepatic transplant 2 . Proposal development dose schedule ensure therapeutic concentration ( 40 % ƒT &gt; MIC ) optimize treatment chance success . 3 . Characterization MICs microbiological strain ( available ) temocillin . 3 . Criteria patient ' selection 3.1 Inclusion Criteria 1 . Male female patient require temocillin 1. treatment urinary tract infection , 2. treatment suspicion cholangitis associate cirrhosis , 3. antibiotic prophylaxis follow hepatic transplant . 2 . Requirement hospitalization ( social non-medical reason ) least 5 day 3 . Patients age 6 month - 3 year begin treatment temocillin 4 . Parents legal representative able give write informed consent accordance GCP local regulatory requirement , prior study procedure 3.2 Exclusion Criteria 1 . Ig-E mediate allergy penicillin 2 . Previous treatment temocillin current cholangitis episode 3 . Diagnosis Alagille syndrome 4 . Estimated life-expectance &lt; 5 day due major co-morbid condition 5 . Other serious illness , e.g . HIV , serious infection require antibiotic , malignancy 6 . Patients acute chronic renal failure ( eGFR &lt; 30ml/min ) 7 . Patients participate another study &lt; 30 day inclusion present study 4 . Investigational Plan 4.1 Study design plan This prospective , open , non-interventional monocentric study take place `` Service de Gastro-entérologie pédiatrique '' `` Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc '' Brussels , Belgium . All patient eligible treatment temocillin evaluate consider inclusion study . For 3 paediatric population , total 10-15 patient eligible participation include study . According manufacturer 's information14 dose 25mg/kg ( case prophylaxis ) 50mg/kg ( case treatment ) every 12 hour use administer IV route . Blood sample draw day 1 day 4 treatment 0.5 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 hour dose administration . The patient 's physician decide duration temocillin use . The expected total duration trial 1 year ( patient enrollment slow ; number patient include : 10-15 3 paediatric population ) . 4.2 Study procedure All blood sample ( 3mL ) take arterial venous catheter collect additive-free blood tube . After blood clotting , centrifuge serum frozen ( -80°C ) analysis . Total concentration free concentration determine validated High Pressure Liquid chromatography-Ultra Violet detection ( HPLC-UV ) method.12,17 In addition , follow parameter record study period : time temocillin administration , patient 's weight , renal liver function marker ( include total serum protein ) , infection marker , concomitant medication . 5 . Statistics The temocillin concentration versus time data serum analyse use non-linear mixed effect model approach use Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Modelling software ( NONMEM version 7.3 ; ICON Development Solutions , Ellicott City , MD ) . The population pharmacokinetic model define , use simulate different dose regimen Monte Carlo simulation , use calculate probability target attainment ( 40 % ƒT &gt; MIC ) free concentration MIC . Statistical significance define P value &lt; 0.05 . JMP version 11 software ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) use statistical analysis . If clinical isolates patient available , MIC distribution hospital consider data analysis . 6 . Administrative Matters The trial carry compliance protocol , principle lay Declaration Helsinki , accordance International Committee Harmonisation ( ICH ) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) accordance applicable regulatory requirement . 6.1 Institutional Review Board / Independent Ethics Committee The trial initiate protocol inform consent subject information form review received approval / favourable opinion local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) . 6.2 Informed Consent Subject Information Prior subject participation trial , write informed consent obtain subject 's legally accept representative accord regulatory legal requirement . Each signature must date signatory inform consent additional subject information form retain investigator part study record . A signed copy inform consent additional subject information must give subject 's legally authorised representative . 7 . Timeframe : Outcome measure assess within maximum 18 month .</detailed_description>
