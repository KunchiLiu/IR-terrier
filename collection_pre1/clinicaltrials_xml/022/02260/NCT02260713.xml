	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Cell Transplantation Persons With Acute Spinal Cord Injury- An Indian Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : Autologous bone marrow cell : Transplantation autologous bone marrow cell transplantation one mention technique : 1 . Directly injured spinal cord site syringe expose spinal cord . 2 . By Intrathecal injection . Number cell Injected : 200 million cell 1.8 ml autologous plasma . In case Direct delivery , cell deliver one sit six site ( 2 lesion , 2 lesion 2 lesion ) 0.3 ml aliquot . In case Intrathecal injection , cell deliver single injection 1.8ml via lumbar puncture . Frequency Injection : Single Total duration Therapy : The procedure Bone marrow harvesting , enrichment transplantation complete single set approximately 2-3 hour . The transplantation procedure case Direct delivery take 2 min per injection site approximately 12 min case lumbar puncture transplantation procedure take approximately 2 min . Comparator Agent : Control : control subject acute complete spinal cord injury would receive bone marrow transplantation .</detailed_description>
