	<brief_title>A Randomized Multi-centre Study Assess Safety Manageability Laparoscopic Adhesion Barrier Women Undergoing Gynecologic Laparoscopic Surgery Followed Second Look Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women undergo laparoscopic uterine myomectomy , adhesiolysis , treatment endometriosis ovarian cystectomy associate adhesion and/or endometriosis , plan , clinically indicated second look laparoscopy within 4-12 week enrol one two sub study major component surgery ( determine surgeon ) due : 1 . Myomectomy Or 2 . Other Gynaecology Pathology ( repeat myomectomy , adhesiolysis , and/or treatment endometriosis , ovarian cystectomy associate adhesion endometriotic pathology , removal adenomyoma without myomectomy . The myomectomy sub study include two arm : 1 . Pure Myomectomy -myomectomy endometriosis adhesions/few filmy uterine adhesion - blunt dissection 2 . Hybrid Myomectomy - myomectomy ( +/- ) adhesion and/or ( +/- ) endometriosis and/or ( +/- ) adenomyomectomy Patients sub study ( 1 2 ) arm myomectomy study ( b ) randomize receive LABS™ follow laparoscopic surgery current standard care : surgery control . All patient blind treatment status study completion . Sub study sub-group allocation well randomisation occur initial laparoscopy complete removal laparoscope . Myomectomy patient randomize receive LABS™ device spray entire surface uterus area surgical trauma . In treated patient sit surgical trauma completely cover LABS™ allow sprayed margin least 3 cm around operate traumatised site . Patients receive LABS™ compare patient current standard care : surgery alone . In addition overall comparison , compare patient sub study ( 1 2 ) arm myomectomy study ( 1a 1b ) . The first two patient enter operate surgeon allocate LABS™ assessed application LABS™ . They count fully evaluable randomized patient . These patient sequentially assign evaluate . With confirmatory evaluation application LABS™ first patient , surgeon advise assign second . With confirmatory evaluation second patient patient discharge hospital surgeon permit proceed study randomise patient . Both initial laparoscopic procedure clinically indicate second look laparoscopy video record allow blind evaluation LABS™ application separate blind evaluation adhesion pathology patient - treat control . This evaluation cross check operating surgeon 's evaluation reconcile accord specify protocol . Where , initial surgery , second look laparoscopy longer consider clinically indicate surgeon randomize patient , follow safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
