	<brief_summary>Obesity result complex interaction genetic environmental factor , strongly associate metabolic complication type 2 diabetes mellitus . Obesity define excessive fat accumulation present risk health , risk highly dependent upon type adipose tissue accumulation , whether visceral sub-cutaneous , also upon characteristic fat tissue , especially inflammatory cell accumulation . Because well know sexual difference fat accretion , obesity-associated risk may also different men woman . In addition , recent data indicate various factor intestinal microbiota , also dietary intake protective nutrient might important determinant metabolic complication obesity . Here propose : 1 ) study metabolic adaptation mechanisms adipose tissue accumulation period control caloric over-nutrition , men woman ; 2 ) evaluate potential protective effect supplementation polyphenols insulin resistance metabolic adaptation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Mechanisms Metabolic Adaptations Overfeeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To achieve goal , healthy male female volunteer enrol one month longitudinal , prospective study influence hypercaloric overfeeding ( +50 % daily caloric need ) different tissue ( adipose tissue , muscle blood ) . They separate two different group : hypercaloric nutrition placebo , hypercaloric nutrition polyphenols ( 2g/day ) , polyphenols administration randomize administer double blind fashion . Whole body hepatic insulin sensitivity , total energy expenditure , glucose hepatic production , protein gene expression muscle , adipose tissue blood well intestinal microbiota assess base line , one month overfeeding .</detailed_description>
