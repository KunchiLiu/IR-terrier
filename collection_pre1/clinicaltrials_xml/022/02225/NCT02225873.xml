	<brief_summary>This study verify whether cranio-cervical flexion coordination ( motor control ) muscle strength training protocol effective improve muscle proprioception muscle strength protocol patient chronic neck pain . Hypothesis : The craniocervical flexion ( motor control ) muscle strength training protocol improve muscle function proprioception muscle strength protocol patient chronic cervical pain . Objective : To find applying strength therapeutic exercise protocol craniocervical flexion coordination ( motor control ) train effective strength articular repositioning protocol carry craniocervical flexion test patient chronic cervical pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neck pain delimit two horizontal line , one low portion occipital region one spinous process first thoracic vertebra . This pain reproduce neck movement exploratory provocation test . Scientific study show least two three people experience neck pain throughout life . Some cause traumatism whiplash although sometimes pain idiopathic . This study verify whether cranio-cervical flexion coordination ( motor control ) muscle strength training protocol effective improve muscle proprioception muscle strength protocol patient chronic neck pain . The project design randomize control evaluator-blinded clinical trial two intervention group : Group 1 ( experimental ) carry motor control exercise cranio-cervical flexion train strength-endurance exercise . Group 2 ( control ) carry exercise improve muscle strength-endurance proprioception . Measurements do begin study , pre post-treatment , one month two month treatment throughout six month treatment . Each session last 45 minute therapy perform without provoke patient symptom . Intervention Experimental group 1 : carry intermuscular coordination exercise cranio-cervical training , follow Jull et al1 , 2 exercise increase strength-endurance neck flexor muscle . Control group 2 : carry proprioception exercise articular reposition training exercise increase strength-endurance neck flexor muscle . They perform way experimental group protocol .</detailed_description>
