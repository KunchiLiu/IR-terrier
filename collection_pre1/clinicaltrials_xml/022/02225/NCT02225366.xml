	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find appropriate dose LL37 give patient melanoma . Researchers also want learn LL37 stimulate immune system help control disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intratumoral Injections LL37 Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level LL37 base join study . Up 4 dose level LL37 test . Up 2 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose LL37 find . Study Drug Administration : One ( 1 ) time week 8 week , LL37 inject 2-4 tumor . The injection do clinic . Study Visits : Within 1 week first study drug injection : - You physical exam . - You punch biopsy tumor . To collect punch biopsy , area skin numb anesthetic small cut make remove part affected tissue . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - The tumor measure photographed . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless tumor face . On Day 1 : - Â° You physical exam . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 2 , punch biopsy one injected tumor . At Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - At Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 7 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn study immune response LL37 . At Week 4 , punch biopsy one inject tumor one tumor injection . Photos tumor take show disease respond study drug . At Week 8 : - Photos LL37 inject site take show disease respond study drug . - You CT scan check status disease . Length Treatment : You receive 8 week study treatment . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Off-Study Visit : If stop study treatment earlier planned disease get worse intolerable side effect : - You physical exam . - The tumor photograph measure . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test study immune response LL37 . - You CT scan check status disease . - You punch biopsy one injected tumor . These off-study procedure complete within 14 day last dose study treatment . You contact phone clinic visit 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) last dose follow drug-related toxicity present end study . Follow-Up : Within 2 week last study drug dose every 8-12 week , scan check status disease . Your doctor decide type scan . After last study drug dose , routine clinic visit every 3 month 1 year , study staff ask status disease , possible . If plan continue receive medical care MD Anderson , study staff contact phone , email , letter ask status disease . The call last 5 minute . This investigational study . LL37 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant treat study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
