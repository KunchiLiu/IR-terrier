	<brief_title>VASCULUX-examination Pulmonary VASCUlar Barrier Patients During LUng Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design single center prospective observational cohort study include patient undergoing lung transplantation due endstage pulmonary disease . It well know pulmonary edema one major problem follow reperfusion new organ . The glycocalyx locate apical surface vascular endothelial cell line vascular lumen . The endothelial glycocalyx consist mainly proteoglycans cover , among others , leukocyte thrombocyte receptor fulfill principal role maintain plasma vessel wall homeostasis . In patient undergoing cardiac surgery study show regional well global ischemia cause increase syndecan-1 heparansulphate plasma reperfusion . The extent pulmonary vascular barrier 's damage might serve predictor postoperative complication reperfusion edema lung . To quantify extent damage investigator seek evaluate correlation ELWI damage vascular barrier . ELWI assess use transpulmonary thermodilution . Components vascular barrier quantify use ELISA-technique . 10 ml full blood drawn 7 different predifined measurement point name T0-T7 follow : - T0 induction anesthesia - T1 reperfusion first lung - T2 5 min reperfusion first lung - T3 reperfusion second lung - T4 5 min reperfusion second lung - T5 admission intensive care unit - T6 6h reperfusion last lung - T7 12h reperfusion last lung For statistical analysis Student 's t-test , Friedman Wilcoxon rank test use , indicate . Expected length study 2 year enrol 30 patient undergoing lung transplantation .</detailed_description>
