	<brief_summary>Background : - Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) blood disease . The drug hydroxyurea ( HU ) approve prevent pain crisis people SCD . Researchers want see high dos HU affect blood . This help learn right dosage HU give people SCD . Objective : - To improve hydroxyurea dose people SCD . Eligibility : - People age 15 old homozygous SCD ( HbSS ) . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , medication review , blood urine test . - Participants study 15 month . - First 3 month : monthly study visit blood urine test . - After 3 month : participant take HU capsule mouth . If already take HU , dose increase . - Within month start increase HU : participant keep daily pain diary 2 week . They echocardiogram ( ultrasound ) heart , 6-minute walk test . They complete quality-of-life questionnaire . - Participants visit every month reach high tolerate dose HU . They may need come often every week sometimes closely monitor blood count . Then alternate phone call one month visit next . At visit , participant bring pill bottle , answer question side effect , blood test . - Every 2 month , participant medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Every 4 month , participant blood urine test . They also complete another 2-week pain diary quality-of-life questionnaire . - About 12 month start increase HU , participant blood test , echocardiogram , 6-minute walk test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Algorithm-Based Hydroxyurea Dosing Fetal Hemoglobin Response , Acute Complications , Organ Function People With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) associate significant morbidity early mortality . Despite discovery disease 100 year ago , one drug , hydroxyurea ( HU ) , FDA-approved . Hydroxyurea exert beneficial effect largely induce fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) thereby inhibit red blood cell sickling . Hydroxyurea show decrease frequency acute complication painful crisis acute chest syndrome . However , previous study conflict regard whether HU improve survival ; 2 long-term study HU titrate maximum tolerate dose show HU improve survival . However , multiple study perform era post-FDA approval HU show change median survival . We others find patient SCD die prematurely evidence renal , hepatic , cardiopulmonary damage . Our work also suggest HU treatment per se sufficient improve survival decrease organ damage patient homozygous SCD ( HbSS ) . Instead , patient treat high HU dose high HbF level appear likely survive less evidence organ damage time . Hydroxyurea management intimidating ; therefore , many adult HbSS either treat HU treat dos FDA-approved . A HU dose algorithm may simplify dose patient treat HU , may titrate maximal tolerate dose may necessary prevent organ damage prolong survival . Further , myelosuppression beyond traditionally recommend may maximize HbF response . This protocol prospective pilot study follow 2 month run-in period . Hydroxyurea dose base write algorithm derive manually , computer program develop NIH Clinical Center . Clinical , laboratory , echocardiographic parameter monitor baseline treatment study effect maximum HbF response acute complication associate HbSS organ function .</detailed_description>
