	<brief_title>Implementation Comprehensive Stroke Rehabilitation Therapy Enhanced Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This comprehensive intervention target impairments prevent recovery normal safe gait , mobility , function , life role participation ( quality life ) . It test chronic stroke survivor find efficacious . The QualPro protocol include three phase , contain component previously mention . The QualPro protocol include implementation gait coordination train address weakness , impaired endurance , dyscoordination . The protocol include implementation balance training fall prevention compose Yang style , 24-posture , short-form Tai Chi . Additionally , QualPro protocol include implementation aerobic training fitness , health , endurance stroke survivor , compose low-volume , high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) cycle ergometer . Strength exercise also include . All exercise address weakness , impaired endurance , dyscoordination . The long-range financial goal research study realize cost saving implement propose combination intervention preclude much costly downwardly spiral sequellae currently observe stroke , currently cost manage care insurance company exorbitant unnecessary amount precious resource .</detailed_description>
