	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine relationship sedative exposure pediatric critical illness long-term neurocognitive outcome . We test drug- dose-dependent relationship sedative exposure neurocognitive outcome along early developmental spectrum control baseline environmental factor , well severity course illness . Hypotheses : 1 . Greater exposure benzodiazepine and/or ketamine associate low IQ even control severity illness , hospital course , baseline factor . In addition , benzodiazepine and/or ketamine negatively affect aspect neurocognitive function . 2 . Younger child expose benzodiazepine and/or ketamine bad neurocognitive outcome older child similar sedative exposure severity illness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ensuring safety comfort 100,000 critically ill infant young child support mechanical ventilation US year integral practice pediatric critical care . Humane care young patient require use sedate medication , commonly combination opioids benzodiazepine . Unfortunately , sedative use also carry risk . Animal study find even transient administration benzodiazepine sedatives period developmental synaptogenesis cause widespread neuronal apoptosis residual learn memory deficit . Sedation administer day week &gt; 90 % acutely-ill , ventilated infant child . Thus , commonly use treatment critically ill young child may detrimental , age-dependent long-term effect . An opportunity increase understand long-term cognitive effect sedation critical illness child provide cluster randomize , control trial sedation protocol , Randomized Evaluation Sedation Titration Respiratory Failure ( RESTORE ) , U01 HL086622 , PI Curley , 31 site , n=2,816 . This trial determine whether trial 's sedation protocol use intervention site decrease duration mechanical ventilation sedative exposure among child acute respiratory failure due primary pulmonary process . Control sit continued usual sedation practice . We collect detailed data dos duration sedative medication , in-hospital course , post-discharge quality life . The purpose RESTORE-cognition determine relationship sedative exposure pediatric critical illness long-term neurocognitive outcome . We assess multiple domain neurocognitive function 2.5-5 year post-discharge 500 RESTORE subject normal baseline cognitive function age 2 week 8 year pediatric intensive care unit admission . In addition , study 310 match , healthy sibling RESTORE subject provide data unexposed group similar baseline biological characteristic environment . Our goal increase understand relationship sedative exposure , critical illness , long-term neurocognitive outcome infant young child .</detailed_description>
