	<brief_summary>Stroke cause sudden blockage blood vessel delivers blood brain . Unblocking blood vessel blood clot removal device restore blood flow do quickly may prevent disability cause stroke . However , stroke patient benefit blood vessel unblock . The aim study determine special brain imaging , call MRI , use identify stroke patient likely benefit attempt unblock blood vessel special blood clot removal device . In particular , assess trial whether noncontrast MR imaging sequence , arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) , demonstrate presence collateral blood flow ( compare gold standard angiogram ) whether useful predict benefit treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( IV tPA ) standard care treatment stroke patient treatment initiate within 3 hour symptom onset . Unfortunately , small fraction stroke patient treated tPA , benefit tPA . This result two main limitation tPA therapy . First , proportion patient treat iv tPA small . Because narrow three hour time-window tPA effective , patient arrive hospital early treat tPA . Most stroke patient , however , arrive hospital three-hour time-window therefore exclude tPA treatment . Second , stroke patient receive tPA always benefit treatment restore blood flow patient . Patients persistent blood vessel occlusion improvement clinical condition receive tPA arrive hospital outside 3 hour time window routinely undergo mechanical clot removal open occlude blood vessel brain . Mechanical clot removal increase percentage stroke patient achieve recanalization , result may increase proportion patient good clinical outcome . However unclear stroke patient mechanical thrombectomy suitable . Although effective remove blood-clots , appear mechanical clot retrieval beneficial patient . Whereas patient benefit , others experience effect , yet others likely harm mechanical clot retrieval . In order avoid harm maximize benefit important know , prior initiation mechanical clot retrieval procedure , procedure likely result clinical improvement . We hypothesize response mechanical clot retrieval predict base characteristic MRI scan obtain prior retrieval procedure . In particular , study ass whether new non-contrast MR imaging method , arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) , measure cerebral blood flow give insight collateral flow , effective predicting benefit treatment . The investigator hope learn new MRI technique help identify patient likely benefit mechanical clot removal receive tPA .</detailed_description>
