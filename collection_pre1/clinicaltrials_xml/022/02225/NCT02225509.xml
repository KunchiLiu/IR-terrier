	<brief_summary>1 . Principal objective : The primary objective study validate diagnostic performance Dx15 molecular test base molecular transcriptomic signature previously identify distincts cohort sample determine malignant benign profile thyroid nodule indeterminate cytological analysis . The target population include category III [ Follicular lesion undetermined significance Atypia undetermined significance ( FLUS/AUS ) ] IV [ Follicular neoplasm / Suspicious follicular neoplasm ( FN/SFN ) ] Bethesda classification . The expected target performance Dx15 molecular test target population 95 % specificity low limit 95 % confidence interval 87 % , 75 % sensitivity . 2 . Secondary objective : - To assess performance Dx15 test sample collect study fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) indeterminate Bethesda classification category ( category III , IV V : suspected malignancy ) - To assess performance TI-RADS ultrasonography score diagnose thyroid cancer patient present thyroid nodule available cytological analysis result . - To check potential performance molecular signature well combination test apply blind manner sample collect patient present thyroid nodule whose aspiration biopsy result benign ( Bethesda category II ) , malignant ( Bethesda category VI ) non-diagnostic ( Bethesda category I ) - To assess performance mutation test ( isolated mutation , chromosomal rearrangement ) diagnose thyroid cancer patient present thyroid nodule available cytological result . - To estimate performance combination Dx15 test result diagnostic tool mutation test and/or TI-RADS score diagnose thyroid cancer patient present thyroid nodule indeterminate cytology result ( especially AUS/FLUS FN/SFN ) . The combination Dx15 diagnostic test result study parameter also consider order establish option algorithmic approach diagnosis thyroid cancer . - To compare result cytological histological analysis obtain centre centralise read assessment impact result study analyse parameter . - Additional analysis deem relevant basis various parameter data collect study . 3 . Objective exploratory research : - The use part FNA sample purpose research part thyroid cancer , especially objective optimise identify additional molecular signature .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study intend patient fine-needle aspiration biopsy thyroid nodule/nodules medically indicate detection thyroid cancer . Fine-needle aspiration biopsy preferably carry ultrasound guidance part patient 's standard management plan . In order limit screen bias , investigator , wherever possible , ask patient see consecutively participate study . Eligible , screen patient inform signed consent form prior study-related activity include notably use storage cell collect fine-needle aspiration biopsy use diagnostic purpose . The fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample collect either remain material FNA dedicate FNA sample order ensure adequate quantity material molecular analysis , necessary . The patient also invite take part mutation study separate consent form . The sample enrol patient send Diaxonhit Genomics Laboratory analyse use Diaxonhit technology check quantity quality sample . Enrolled patient whose sample inadequate term quantity quality various molecular test consider study . If necessary , mutation analysis carry anonymously independent French laboratory supervision Diaxonhit . For patient , result cytological histological analysis monitor program carry centre record electronic case report form ( e-CRF ) generate anonymous data base host Clinfile - data management company . All patient follow malignant benign status nodule ( ) know follow fine needle aspiration biopsy , histological analysis surgical specimen , fail , clinical monitoring . Patients undergone surgery follow histological result obtain . In case patient undergone surgery , follow-up carry minimal period 1 year ( 12 month ) , patient 's enrolment . Patients undergone surgery clinically follow maximum 12 month enrolment last study patient order benefit extend follow-up patient enter study early stage . The result cytological histological analysis confirm centralised re-reading slide statistical analysis , blind status . In conjunction validate identify signature attempt improve diagnostic test thyroid cancer , Diaxonhit company reserve right carry additional exploratory analysis part sample collect order identify new molecular signature . These potentially new signature validate protocol . The primary endpoint criterion proportion correct classification define malignant benign nature fine-needle aspiration biopsy carry patient present thyroid nodule indeterminate cytology Bethesda category III IV . The result obtain signature compare histology result surgical specimen , fail , result monitor program implement clinician . Evaluation performance previously identify transcriptome signature also carry every category , may may indeterminate accord Bethesda classification . This information consider secondary endpoint criterion . Other secondary endpoint criterion include proportion correct classification obtain signature link predictive test mutation test TIRADS score order define malignant benign nature fine-needle aspiration biopsy carry patient present thyroid nodule indeterminate cytology . The result obtain combination test compare histological analysis surgical sample otherwise result monitor program implement clinician . The result study parameter , essentially clinical , laboratory demographic , also combine attempt define potential algorithmic approach diagnose thyroid cancer . The performance Dx15 molecular test determine target population use Bethesda category III IV sample . The enrolment 1000 patient schedule order achieve necessary recruitment level category III IV . For purpose study , Dx15 test may also apply sample cohort Bethesda category ( I : non-diagnostic , II : benign , V : SMC , VI : malignant ) order identify test performance category . Whenever possible , fine-needle aspiration sample test Dx15 use determine performance , presence related histopathological result surgical specimen give priority . A sample eligible assessment one meet Diaxonhit quality quantity criterion order enable schedule molecular analysis . Recruitment perform center specialized diagnosis follow-up thyroid cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient selection criterion : Men woman age 18 year old , Patient present least one thyroid nodule fine needle aspiration biopsy indicate diagnosis thyroid cancer , Patient cover social security program benefiting comparable program , Patient sign write informed consent form participate study . N.B . : patient must also sign specific form mutation analysis . 2 . Patient inclusion criterion : Selection criterion , Patient undergone fineneedle aspiration biopsy thyroid nodule , cytological result classify accord Bethesda criterion , Patient whose surgical specimen likely undergone histological analysis ( benign/malignant ) least followup monitoring program allow diagnosis . 3 . Noninclusion criterion : Adults 18 year age legal protection unable give consent , Patient take part another clinical trial likely affect thyroid function , previous month screen process , Patients currently receive treatment cancer remission less two year ( except basal squamous cell skin cancer ) , Patient present multinodular goitre dominant module , i.e . nodule easily identifiable imaging monitor throughout study , Patient likely comply protocol , particular , follow investigate centre throughout study , Clinically significant , acute and/or unstable disease , , investigator 's opinion , likely interfere significantly patient evaluation followup study .</criteria>
