	<brief_summary>With good medical care , patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , life-threatening disease , enjoy long life . As CF life expectancy increase , condition CF-related diabetes ( CFRD ) become prevalent . Nutrition play major role maintain optimal health cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . This project design investigate nutrition-related factor , vitamin D status , oxidative stress fat oxidation may influence long-term survival CF CFRD . Based preliminary clinical metabolomics research finding , work hypothesis project : 1 ) oxidative stress CF contribute impaired fat oxidation , 2 ) vitamin D supplementation normalizes oxidative stress , subsequently , fat oxidation . This study combine state art method traditional clinical method assess fat oxidation , oxidative stress , nutritional status adult cystic fibrosis . Research method include blood draw plasma marker oxidative stress metabolomics ( measurement thousand small chemical blood ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI , ass energy capacity thigh fat ) , dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA , assess total regional body fat muscle ) , indirect calorimetry ( assess rest energy expenditure whole body fat oxidation ) . Clinically-relevant data , lung function , CF genotype , diabetes status obtain electronic medical record CF Registry . This study consist two sub-studies . The first cross-sectional study 66 clinically-stable adult CF 44 healthy control participant . Testing clinically-stable adult occur Emory University Hospital ( EUH ) Clinical Research Network ( CRN ) outpatient unit ( blood draw , indirect calorimetry , DEXA ) Emory University Biomedical Imaging Technology Center ( BITC ) MRI image . The second study ancillary longitudinal study ongoing , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized high-dose vitamin D trial ( DISC Study , IRB00052829 , PI : Tangpricha ) patient CF hospitalize pulmonary exacerbation . Blood draw indirect calorimetry perform patient within 72 hrs hospital admission ( vitamin D dosing ) , 3 6 month outpatient follow-up visit . The data generate study use inform future nutrition intervention study adults CF CFRD .</brief_summary>
