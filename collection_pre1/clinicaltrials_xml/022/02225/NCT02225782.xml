	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis procedure kidney physician perform kidney fail long clean blood remove extra fluid toxin body . Hemodialysis therefore require access reach blood either surgically create permanent fistula graft insertion temporary catheter one large body vein . While use fistula graft preferred permanent , may condition prevent patient hemodialysis catheter may use instead . The problem use catheter however become blocked due formation blood clot . Kidney physicians try resolve occlusion hemodialysis catheter inject medication call Alteplase break clot catheter site . There consensus medical community much medication inject occluded catheter site . While kidney physician study recommend use 1.0 mg medication occlusion site , others recommend 2.0 mg medication use . Thus , purpose randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness 1.0mg versus 2.0mg dose alteplase resolve blood clot hemodialysis catheter . The investigator recruit patient study regional hemodialysis unit locate southwestern Ontario . Patients agree participate research experience occlusion hemodialysis catheter divide two group ; make sure division completely chance . The first group receive 1.0mg alteplase , second receive 2.0mg Alteplase . The investigator collect information group run statistical analysis information compare result clot resolution group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Compare 1.0 Versus 2.0 mg Alteplase ( tPA ) Dosing Restoring Hemodialysis Catheter Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary purpose study examine effectiveness tPA 2.0 mg compare 1.0 mg restore hemodialysis catheter ( HDC ) function blood occlusion . Specifically , study aim : 1 . Examine risk reduction ( absolute relative ) HDC occlusion associate administration 2.0mg tPA oppose 1.0 mg tPA HD patient 2 . Compare median catheter removal time hemodialysis ( HD ) patient experience HDC occlusion manage tPA 2.0 mg manage tPA 1.0 mg. 3 . Compare average number tPA repeat HD patient receive 2.0 mg receive 1.0 mg dose . 4 . Compare rate HDC strip HD patient experience HDC occlusion manage 2.0 mg tPA manage 1.0 mg tPA . Hypotheses 1 . Patients receive tPA 2.0 mg dose management HDC blood occlusion experience high rate HDC function restoration patient receive tPA 1.0 mg dose . 2 . Median time HDC catheter removal successful management HDC occlusion tPA high among receive 2.0 mg tPA receive 1.0 mg tPA . 3. b ) The number repeat tPA administration less among patient receive 2.0 mg dose among receive 1.0 mg dose . 4 . The rate HDC strip HD patient experience catheter occlusion lower among patient receive 2.0 mg tPA among patient receive 1.0 mg tPA . Methods Materials A double blind , randomize , control clinical trial conduct consent hemodialysis patient require tPA management HDC dysfunction . All patient recruit regional out-patient HD unit southwestern Ontario . Eligible HD patient approach verbal write explanation research , invite sign write consent participate study . All consent patient randomly assign either two study group , base allocation concealment principle , immediately experience HDC occlusion due blood clot . Patient recruitment continue minimum sample 75 participant per group achieve , provide total minimum sample 150 participant . Recruitment Protocol All study participant recruit out-patient HD unit region , provide HD service average 250 patient give year . Prior initiation study , research team hold information session orient staff HD unit study protocol . All HD patient attend regional unit approach information study , purpose protocol , ask provide voluntary write consent participate study . Consents seek prospective participant HDC occlusion take place . Once HDC occlusion report patient deem nurse eligible tPA management accord guideline Medical Directive tPA administration , patient allocate either study group research assistant . Patient allocation perform base predetermine concealed random sequence ensure neither patient member research team aware patient random allocation either study group . To ensure two group equal number participant , block randomization approach five participant per block implement . In order enhance allocation concealment process , random code generate colleague member research team use computer program . Each random allocation code keep accord order sequence oblique envelope lock cabinet HD unit . Data Collection tPA Administration Protocols Once allocate treatment group , patient blindly give treatment accord medical directive HD unit administration tPA management HDC occlusion . To ensure blind treatment , two group cod `` A '' `` B '' code know pharmacist ( involve study ) pre-fill tPA syringe label accordingly . Thus , pharmacist prepare 1.0mg 2.0mg dos 2.0ml syrinx ; whereby 1.0mg dose prepared concentration 1.0mg/2.0ml , 2.0mg dose prepared concentration 2.0mg/2.0ml . The vary syringe concentration ensure dos identical ensure blind two study group . Once ready administer tPA accord medical directive , HD nurse instill prefilled tPA solution occlude HDC lumen allow dwell lumen 30 minute . The HD nurse withdraw 3.0 ml blood occlude lumen assess patency . If backflow HDC deem patent , HD nurse recommence HD . If HDC lumen patent first instill , HD nurse may repeat tPA administration procedure maximum total three time referral therapeutic radiology arrange strip catheter . Data total number repeat , outcome repeat , outcome radiology collect . The nurse initiating tPA medical directive document administration tPA patient medication record accord volume ( i.e. , 2ml pre-filled dose ) . He/she also communicate procedure Research Assistant study separate log book keep nurse ' station HD unit . The Research Assistant review log book regular basis collect data tPA administration procedure , demographic information , prognostic factor , participant ' relevant medication blood lab , medical history . Patients follow tPA management he/she reach study endpoint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient deem eligible inclusion study he/she : 1 . Is ≥ 18 year age , 2 . Is receive HD chronic renal failure use permanent HDC insert follow site : internal jugular , subclavian , femoral vein 3 . Has medical contradiction tPA management partially fully occlude HDC . In addition , first occlusion event require tPA administration single catheter include . However , new catheter insertion patient study treat new event . That , single patient may randomize one time he/she experience insertion one catheter course study Pregnant woman Patients receive ≤ 7 dialysis treatment session dialysis le 15 day Patients contraindication , allergy , history intolerance tPA exclude</criteria>
