	<brief_summary>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) severe disease major cause death many people worldwide . It cause bacteria enters lung spread elsewhere body . People latent TB bacteria lie dormant become active cause disease . These people offer treatment prevent development active TB . Worldwide , lot people LTBI also parasitic worm call helminth stay gut blood . These parasite affect immune system cause diseases like TB become worse . Researchers want see helminth infection make hard people fight TB infection . Objectives : - To study immune system people latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) act prevent development active TB . Also , study helminth infection might affect immune response . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 70 LTBI define approve blood test call QuantiFERON TB Gold . - No evidence infection like Hepatitis HIV - Pregnant subject subject take medication suppress immune system eligible . - Have receive prior treatment LTBI . Participants might still eligible prior treatment active TB receive Design : Screening phase : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test infections/conditions might affect immune system . They test active TB i.e . blood test well test spit , scan X-rays . Baseline phase : - Only eligible participant enter study . - Participants interview , medical history , physical exam . - Blood drawn arm vein test . - Participants collect stool sample home 3 day row test helminth infection.. - Participants may apheresis . Blood cell remove needle . They pass separator machine return everything cell back participant . - Participants may procedures start end study let researcher look lung collect cell . Study phase , 2 year : - All participant offer treatment LTBI last 6-9 month . - Participants treat LTBI 11 study visit . They visit monthly 9 month treatment , 6 12 month treatment . - Participants eligible/refusing treatment LTBI make aware active TB , 3 visit , 6 , 12 , 24 month baseline visit . - Participants helminth infection receive appropriate treatment . - All participant blood drawn visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Responses Mycobacterium Tuberculosis ( Mtb ) People With Latent Tuberculosis Infection With Without Concomitant Helminth Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection remain important cause morbidity mortality worldwide . A problem eradication effort large reservoir ~2 billion people latent tuberculosis ( TB ) infection ( LTBI ) poor understanding factor lead active disease progression . Helminth infection geographically overlap Mtb induce significant immune-mediated modulation . Although CD4+T cell produce IFN-gamma TNF-alpha implicate protective immunity TB , detailed description evolution protective immunomodulatory response LTBI lack . Additionally , incomplete understand immunomodulation cause helminth co-infection affect responses . This protocol attempt fill knowledge gap comprehensive longitudinal immunological analysis two population subject LTBI , without concurrent helminth infection ( HEL+ HEL- respectively ) . In group , venipuncture possibly apheresis perform understand protective modulatory T cell monocyte/macrophage response . Subjects receive treatment helminth infection treatment LTBI offer accord current standard care guideline . Two group subject within LTBI group offer bronchoscopy lavage -- - ( ) structural lung damage prior treated/healed tuberculosis ( b ) recent prolonged exposure ( great equal 3 month ) household contact active TB . The primary objective evaluate CD4+ T cell response regulatory T cell response HEL+ HEL- subject LTBI time diagnosis ( baseline ) . HEL+ subject receive treatment parasitic infection group ( HEL+ HEL- ) offer LTBI treatment . Evolution baseline TB-specific immune response LTBI treatment study . Additionally , baseline immune response mycobacteria contrast HEL+ group time point post treatment helminth infection . A secondary objective evaluate immune phenotype functionality tissue resident immune cell obtain bronchoalveolar lavage subject LTBI structural lung damage prior treated/healed pulmonary tuberculosis well subject recent prolonged TB exposure active TB case irrespective helminth infection status . An exploratory objective evaluate subset subject within LTBI group ( irrespective helminth infection status ) stable pool long lasting antigen-specific IL-2 produce CD4+ central memory T cell change pool receive LTBI treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA All subject must meet following criterion : Subjects must 1 following : Untreated LTBI , define positive Quantiferon TB Gold assay ; absence active TB disease determine history , physical examination , chest Xray , negative sputum smear culture Mtb ; history prior treatment LTBI . OR Chronic inactive TB , define past history document selfreported active pulmonary TB treatment receive ; current negative sputum smear culture Mtb ; positive result Quantiferon TB Gold assay . These subject compose treatmentinduced LTBI group require treatment LTBI . Age 1870 year . Subjects age 70 include due increase potential immune senescence With without clinical/microbiologic/serologic evidence untreated concurrent helminth infection Agree blood specimen store future study Subjects undergoing optional bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage must meet following additional inclusion criterion : Subjects must 1 following : Documented self report history prior treat TB positive Quantiferon TB Gold test structural lung finding chronic inactive tuberculosis radiologic imaging , define : ) calcify Ghon focus without apical calcify nodule ( Simon focus ) , b ) parenchymal pleural calcification , and/or c ) apical fibrosis cavitary change . OR History recent prolonged ( great equal 3 month ) exposure confirm case active TB disease . Able willing arrange another person drive home procedure Able willing eat drink anything 6 hour prior 2 hour procedure Agree respiratory tract sample store future research EXCLUSION CRITERIA A subject exclude meet follow criterion : Presence active TB disease Treatment helminth infection within past year Positive screening HIV , hepatitis B , and/or hepatitis C Cardiovascular instability ( Blood pressure : Systolic &gt; 180 &lt; 90 mm/Hg Diastolic &gt; 100 &lt; 50 mm/Hg ; pulse &lt; 40 &gt; 110 ) Inadequate peripheral venous access Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL ) Current use corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent document diagnosis primary immunodeficiency disorder Underlying heart disease , lung disease , bleed disorder , condition , judgment investigator , contraindicate apheresis Temperature great equal 38.5 degree C clinical evidence acute infection screen Currently pregnant breastfeed A subject eligible optional bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage meet follow additional exclusion criterion : History recent/acute clinically significant pulmonary compromise . This define follow criterion : New lung infection change status chronic lung infection significant new finding chest Xray CT scan Asthma unstable require emergent care , urgent care , hospitalization , intubation past two year , require use oral parenteral corticosteroid past two year Clinically significant reactive airway disease respond bronchodilator Unstable chronic lung disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) pulmonary fibrosis History pulmonary hypertension Requirement supplemental oxygen rest Unstable angina uncontrolled heart failure rhythm disturbance Significant kidney liver disease Bleeding disorder diagnose doctor ( e.g. , factor deficiency , coagulopathy , platelet disorder require special precaution ) , significant bruise bleed difficulty IM injection blood draw , use anticoagulant medication Use platelet inhibitor include aspirin NSAIDs within 7 day procedure clopidogrel ( Plavix [ TM ] ) within 14 day procedure inability safely stop platelet inhibitor 714 day prior procedure History allergic reaction lidocaine , sedative medication like Valium ( TM ) Versed ( TM ) , narcotic medication like morphine fentanyl Any medical , psychiatric , social condition , occupational reason responsibility , judgment investigator , contraindication bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage impairs volunteer ability give inform consent procedure</criteria>
