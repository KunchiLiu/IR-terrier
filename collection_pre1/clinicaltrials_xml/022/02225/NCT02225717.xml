	<brief_summary>The investigator project aim identify , pregnant woman , discriminate molecule allow early detection woman spontaneously deliver prematurely , suitable routine clinical practice . Human parturition tightly correlate hormonal change maternal-fetal interface pregnancy , may control cell interaction fetal membrane ( water bag ) remodelling . Precocious remodelling may lead premature onset labor , associated premature rupture membrane whether cause infectious . In regard , remodelled fetal membrane overlie cervix may discharge signal could detectable cervico-vaginal fluid serve biomarkers imminence delivery . Such information delivery timing may great importance adequate prediction would change drastically management threaten preterm delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prematurity major Public Health concern develop country , since first cause perinatal morbi-mortality cerebral palsy early childhood . Premature birth rate rise 36 percent last 25 year reach 7.2 % 2010 France . Antenatal corticosteroids administration 34 week utero transfer high-qualified maternity ward one rare antenatal therapy recommend improve neonatal complication preterm delivery . Early identification woman high risk preterm birth helpful implement prophylactic measure . Moreover discriminate true preterm labor ( PTL ) vs. symptom PTL woman , finally deliver term , would reduce unnecessary hospitalization prescription . During human gestation , fetal membrane ( `` water bag '' ) encompass amnion , face amniotic cavity , chorion , line maternal decidua comprise trophoblast cell . Membranes usually remain intact spontaneous rupture , close first stage labor term . Often see simple inert shell , role `` airbag '' develop fetus , membrane provide yet large surface interaction maternal fetal tissue function transient endocrine organ immune property . Specific remodelling membrane observe term prior delivery . During remodelling , drastic change extracellular matrix occur , secretion specific molecule . The investigator hypothesize premature fetal membrane remodelling occurs week prior actual birth may able detected woman risk preterm birth , i.e . present sign PTL . This study investigate detection fetal membrane remodelling cervico-vaginal fluid accurately identify woman great risk preterm birth . A prospective cohort pregnant woman 32 week gestation symptom preterm labor enrol . As negative control , healthy pregnant woman 12-15 35-36 week gestation non-pregnant woman recruit . As positive control , healthy pregnant woman term ( 38 week gestation ) enrol . The main outcome assess preterm delivery .</detailed_description>
