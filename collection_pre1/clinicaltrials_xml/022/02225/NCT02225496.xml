	<brief_summary>Standard-of-care treatment option oropharyngeal cancer often result long-term side effect interfere normal quality life . A minimally-invasive transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) approach develop operate disease site affect surround tissue little possible . Researchers think approach may help control disease avoid long-term side effect . The goal clinical research study learn minimally-invasive transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) help control HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer . Transoral mean mouth . The TORS approach call Intuitive Surgical da Vinci Surgical System . Researchers also want learn surgery affect participant ' ability speak swallow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Surgery : If find eligible take part study , schedule surgery . You receive general anesthesia make sleep procedure . You ask sign separate consent form describe anesthesia risk . If doctor think need , abnormal area look tube light camera one end ( call laryngoscopy ) check size tumor look additional cancerous area . The tumor expose standard equipment teeth protect dental guard . Using robotic surgical system , tumor remove . Your affected lymph node surgically remove neck . The robotic system use part surgery . The nerve control shoulder , blood vessel bring blood back heart brain neck , major muscle front neck save , unless tumor lymph node grow directly area . A drain place surgical wound close . The drain usually remove within week surgery . Based result surgery , receive adjuvant therapy ( therapy surgery ) . For example , surgery remove enough cancer , refer receive radiation therapy . There likely need 1-2 week delay receive radiation therapy . Your doctor discus therapy detail , include risk . Length Study : The surgery stop doctor think tumor large remove robotic system . You take study unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit data collection . Follow-Up Visits : Within 1-4 week surgery ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam , include cranial nerve exam tongue , palate , facial nerve . - You MBS . - You meet speech pathologist . - You complete questionnaire speech swallow function . At 6 month ( +/- 2 month ) , 12 month ( +/- 2 month ) , 24 month ( +/- 6 month ) surgery : - You MBS . - You cranial nerve exam tongue , palate , facial nerve . - You meet speech pathologist . - You complete questionnaire speech swallow function . As often doctor think need 5 year surgery , study staff check medical record find treatment follow-up . This investigational study . The robotic surgical procedure ( daVinci Surgical System ) FDA approve commercially available . The study doctor explain surgery design work . Up 150 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients previously untreated , T1 T2 , N0N2b transorally resectable ( determined treat surgeon ) , histologically proven HPV positive , squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) oropharynx . 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) PS 02 . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 year . 4 . Negative serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential . 5 . Patients must sign studyspecific inform consent form prior treatment . 1 . Evidence distant metastasis ( clavicle ) clinical radiographic examination . 2 . Evidence primary cancer metastasis . Evidence deep softtissue bony invasion , would preclude TMIS clinical and/or radiographic exam . 3 . Contraindications general anesthesia . 4 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy oropharynx prior enter study . 5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 6 . Patients tumor whose resection would necessitate freetissue transfer reconstruction surgical defect .</criteria>
