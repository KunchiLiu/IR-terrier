	<detailed_description>Patients meet criterion MCI initially randomize one 3 condition . Participants complete cognitive training exercise home clinic-provided computer 60 minute per day , 5 day per week . Compliance performance monitor weekly basis completion study . Outcome measure collect one week initiation intervention within one week completion intervention . Neuropsychological functioning , include test process speed , attention , executive functioning , serve primary outcome measure . Patient report outcome , include measure overall QOL disease-specific QOL , support-person report outcome ( applicable ) , include measure overall QOL caregiver burden , secondary outcome measure . This pilot study promise evaluate computer-based cognitive training novel population expand access cognitive rehabilitation service , design improve cognitive functioning QOL among wide range individual PD .</detailed_description>
