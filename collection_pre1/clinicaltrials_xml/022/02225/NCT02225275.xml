At time study , doctor think need , radiographic test check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue take lenalidomide long doctor think best interest . You may receive 6 cycle obinutuzumab . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Lenalidomide indicate recommended treatment patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) outside control clinical trial . Obinutuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . It investigational give lenalidomide obinutuzumab together treat CLL SLL . The study doctor explain study drug ( ) design work . Up 60 patient enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
