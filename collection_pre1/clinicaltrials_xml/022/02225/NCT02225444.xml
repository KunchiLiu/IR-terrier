	<brief_summary>OsteoAMP allograft ( transplantation part one person another person ) derive growth factor rich bone graft use spinal fusion . The study design obtain high level clinical evidence OsteoAMP spinal fusion procedure garner FDA regulatory approval . This prospective , non-randomized , non-controlled , multi-center study OsteoAMP instrument , posterolateral lumbar fusion ( PLF ) patient degenerative disc disease , degenerative spondylolisthesis ( grade 1 ) , and/or mild degenerative scoliosis , 25 degree curvature . Patients schedule undergo instrument , posterolateral spinal fusion surgery part medical treatment comply study eligibility criterion give opportunity consent enter study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Instrumented , Posterolateral Lumbar Fusions ( PLF ) With OsteoAMP®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective clinical study : evaluate long term efficacy OsteoAMP patient require 1 2 adjacent level , instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion procedure lumbar lumbosacral spine , evaluate OsteoAMP spinal fusion procedure base fusion result , adverse event rate , pain health score . Patients schedule undergo instrument , posterolateral spinal fusion ( PLF ) surgery part medical treatment comply study eligibility criterion recruit entered study . Subjects recruit study receive OsteoAMP part instrument PLF surgical procedure . The surgery may also include nerve root decompression laminectomy foraminotomies . As consistent current standard care . The study involve consecutive patient suffer low back leg pain due degenerative disc disease ( DDD ) , degenerative spondylolisthesis ( grade 1 ) , and/or mild degenerative scoliosis candidate instrument PLF pedicle screw 1 2 motion segment lumbar lumbosacral spine . Patients require total bone graft volume least 10cc per side per level PLF procedure , include OsteoAMP granule hydrate bone marrow aspirate ( BMA ) local autogenous bone . Subjects follow 24 month post-surgery .</detailed_description>
