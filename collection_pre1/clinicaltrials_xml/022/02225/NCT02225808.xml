	<brief_summary>This open , pilot study neural mechanism cognitive-behavioral therapy anxiety child high-functioning autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . In addition core symptom , approximately forty percent child ASD exhibit clinically significant level anxiety . Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) promise treatment anxiety child high-functioning ASD , neural mechanism treatment study . CBT teach emotion regulation skill cognitive reappraisal , follow behavioral exposure anxiety-provoking situation . The investigator propose investigate neural mechanism CBT anxiety evaluate fMRI index socioemotional functioning treatment child , age 8 14 , high-functioning ASD . Dysfunction amygdala connectivity prefrontal cortex implicate co-occurring ASD anxiety . In investigator research , compare typically develop control , child ASD show low activation several region prefrontal cortex lack down-regulation amygdala task emotion regulation . Based observation , investigator propose positive response CBT anxiety child ASD associate increase activation several region prefrontal cortex well increased functional connectivity prefrontal region amygdala task emotion regulation . The primary aim pilot study examine effect CBT neural basis anxiety ASD collect fMRI data emotion regulation , face perception , rest treatment . The investigator hypothesize CBT increase prefrontal activity , decrease amygdala reactivity , enhance amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity emotion regulation . The investigator also hypothesize CBT decrease amygdala reactivity perception emotional face . Additional analysis conduct explore change resting-state functional connectivity CBT anxiety child ASD .</brief_summary>
