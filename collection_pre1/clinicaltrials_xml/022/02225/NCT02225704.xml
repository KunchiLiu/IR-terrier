	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent obtain prior studyrelated procedure 2 . Age ≥18 year male . 3 . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . 4 . Histologically/cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate , without neuroendocrine differentiation small cell histology . 5 . Metastatic disease confirm Computed tomography ( CT ) / Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) bone scan . 6 . 6 . Patients must document Progressive disease ( PD ) either radiographic PSA criterion define ) b ) : 1 . For Radiographic PD assessment , 2 set scan use image modality ( ie CT/MRI bone scan ) take separate time point require document radiographic disease progression follow patient 's recent antineoplastic therapy , ( note : 1st bone scan recent therapy 2nd scan must show disease progression recent therapy ) . For patient bone disease , progression assess follow recommendation Prostate Cancer Working Group ( PCWG2 , see Appendix FC ) : appearance 2 new lesion bone scan , confirm , necessary , image modality ( CT scan MRI ) , result bone scan ambiguous ) . For patient soft tissue lesion progression assess use RECIST 1.1 criterion , ( see Appendix GD ) . Patients may measurable nonmeasurable disease accord RECIST criterion version 1.1 ( see Appendix GD ) 2 . PSA progression define increase PSA , determine 2 separate measurement take least 1 week apart confirm third . If third measurement great second measurement , fourth measurement must take must great second measurement patient eligible study . Furthermore , confirmatory PSA measurement ( i.e . third , applicable , fourth PSA measurement ) must define . If patient receive prior antiandrogen therapy ( e.g . bicalutamide ) , PSA progression must evident documented discontinuation antiandrogen therapy , ( note : The 1st PSA reading take document disease progression patient present patient Casodex ADT ) . 7 . Prior surgical castration concurrent use agent medical castration testosterone screen less 50ng/dL . 8 . Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL . 9 . Patients , even surgically sterilize ( i.e . status postvasectomy ) : abstain intercourse must agree use barrier contraception 6 month discontinuation study treatment . If patient engage sexual intercourse woman childbearing potential , condom another form birth control must use 6 month treatment . 10 . Stable medical condition 11 . Life expectancy 12 month base general health prostate cancer disease status judge investigator . 12 . Documented presence osseous metastasis without visceral involvement / lymph node . 13 . Able swallow study drug whole tablet . 14 . Adequate haematological , hepatic , renal function . 15 . Continuous daily use oral prednisone , oral dexamethasone , systemic corticosteroid allow prior study entry must discontinue minimum 2 week prior start study treatment . 1 . Patients receive investigational agent ( within 30 day prior registration ) 2 . Patients Gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract disease result inability take oral medication , malabsorption syndrome , requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease ( e.g . Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . 3 . Have current active hepatic biliary disease 4 . Prior therapy orteronel , ketoconazole , aminoglutethimide , abiraterone enzalutamide 5 . All antiandrogen therapy ( include bicalutamide ) exclude within 6 week prior first dose study drug . Any therapies prostate cancer , GnRH analogue therapy , progesterone , medroxyprogesterone , progestin ( megesterol ) , 5alpha reductase inhibitor ( eg , finasteride dutasteride ) , must discontinue 2 week first dose study drug . [ Bisphosphonates Denosumab allow concomitant medication ] . 6 . Prior chemotherapy prostate cancer exception : neoadjuvant/ adjuvant therapy part initial primary treatment local disease complete 2 year prior screen . Patients receive prior docetaxol castrate sensitive metastatic prostate cancer commence 120 day ADT initation total dose receive exceed 450mg/m2 7 . Prior exposure bone direct radioisotope therapy , eg samarium 153 , strontium 90 ; 8 . Exposure external beam radiation within 4 week prior receive first dose study drug . In patient untreated imminent establish spinal cord compression , treatment standard care , clinically indicate , complete start treatment Ra223 dichloride ( Xofigo® ) . 9 . Diagnosis treatment another systemic malignancy within 2 year first dose study drug , previously diagnose another malignancy evidence residual disease . 10 . History myocardial infarction , unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease/ unstable angina , uncontrolled ongoing arrhythmia Grade &gt; 2 , pulmonary embolism , cardiac condition within 6 month prior first dose study drug . 11 . New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure . 12 . History seizure , underlie brain injury loss consciousness , stroke , transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) , cerebral vascular accident , primary brain tumour brain metastasis , brain arteriovenous malformation , alcoholism. , use concomitant medication may lower seizure threshold . 13 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , active chronic hepatitis B C , lifethreatening illness unrelated cancer , ongoing serious medical psychiatric illness could , investigator 's opinion , potentially interfere participation study . Patients test hepatitis B C HIV infection screen consider investigator high risk infection previously test , test require independent ethic committee institutional review board . 14 . Prohibited medication , include drug may affect exposure enzalutamide i.e . study drug induce inhibit CYP3A4 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9</criteria>
