	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn dietary habit affect vasopressin secretion patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease . Vasopressin increase growth kidney cysts accelerate disease progression . Understanding control secretion hormone base dietary habit may help develop treatment control disease . The study include 60 patient Tufts Medical Center . The study last 2 week . Blood urine test do 3 time study period . Subjects randomly assign ( chance like flip coin ) , one two study group . Group 1 give instruction adjust diet . This include adjust amount water , protein , salt intake . Group 2 adjustment diet water . The project tremendous public health relevance , give large number people affect autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease substantial impact disease morbidity , mortality , hospitalization , dialysis transplant , societal cost care patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) common hereditary kidney disease estimate 600,000 person affect United States 12.5 million person worldwide . To date , disease-modifying treatment approve treatment ADPKD . Arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) key player cyst enlargement disease progression . It establish patient ADPKD high level AVP compare healthy control . Suppression , blockade elimination AVP slow cyst progression . AVP-V2 receptor inhibition control disease progression animal model human , genetic elimination vasopressin Polycystic Kidney ( PCK ) rat . This evidence indicate AVP could promise target therapeutic intervention . Unfortunately , clinically test medication block AVP-V2 receptor ( Tolvaptan ) associate side effect include hypernatremia , hyperuricemia elevate liver enzymes . An ideal therapeutic approach target AVP patient ADPKD would safe , easy administer could adopt early disease process prevent permanent kidney damage . High fluid intake present one possible treatment , show suppress plasma level AVP , slow cyst progression animal model polycystic kidney disease . However , adherence high fluid intake diet difficult maintain clinical practice . To address adherence challenge , The investigator develop stepwise approach combine low osmolar diet ( low protein salt ) adjust water intake , goal lower amount water intake need suppress AVP secretion . The major objective proposal evaluate whether intervention suppress vasopressin secretion patient early ADPKD . Vasopressin suppression assess measure copeptin level , show reliable surrogate marker circulate AVP concentration . The rationale proposal base fact part difficulty sustain low AVP level daily water ingestion consumption diet generate large number osmoles ; high osmolar load stimulate vasopressin secretion maintain water homeostasis . Hence , combine low osmolar diet adjust water intake might prove sufficient suppress vasopressin secretion clinical setting . The investigator propose follow : Specific Aim : To conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate effect low osmolar diet high water intake intervention vasopressin secretion , urine osmolality , daily solute excretion adult patient ADPKD . The investigator hypothesize low osmolar diet combine adjusted water intake decrease serum copeptin level total daily solute excretion patient ADPKD compare control arm . To accomplish research goal , current proposal build upon exist expertise Tufts Medical Center conduct controlled clinical trial patient ADPKD . The expected outcome include identification relevant , safe , easily tolerate affordable intervention suppress vasopressin secretion ADPKD patient early disease process ; propose stepwise approach combine low osmolar diet adjust water intake carry premise lowering amount water need suppress AVP secretion potentially slow progression devastate disorder . The study long-term goal evaluate whether therapeutic approach could tolerate patient long period time , could impact clinical outcome measure kidney volume kidney function progression .</detailed_description>
