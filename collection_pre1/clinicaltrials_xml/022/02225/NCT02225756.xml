	<brief_summary>Aneurysms aorta dilatation main artery body distribute blood organ . Aneurysms expose patient aortic rupture . The risk aortic rupture high large aneurysm , low small aneurysm . Currently , diameter small aneurysm grows level risk rupture , surgery indicate prevent rupture . A drug would stop growth small aneurysm would obviate aortic surgery , current treatment prevent aortic rupture patient . The ACA4 study aim test possibility stop growth small aortic aneurysm abdomen drug , cyclosporine A . Patients small aneurysm receive cyclosporine A orally , placebo ( fake liquid ) , every day short period time . Efficacy drug evaluate measure diameter aneurysm 2 year treatment cessation . Drug safety analysis evaluate impact drug renal function , blood pressure , parameter . In case adverse event drug administration phase , dose drug placebo decrease administration stop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclosporine A Patients With Small Diameter Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAAs ) expose patient death cause aortic rupture . Although screen AAAs show decrease AAA-related mortality , translation medical practice screening limit specific treatment limit growth AAAs diameter threshold open surgery stent graft . We develop different approach aim induce heal thereby stabilize form AAAs animal model . We identify TGF-beat1 inducer experimental AAA healing . Cyclosporine A inducer tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) experimental AAAs human atherosclerotic AAAs vitro , cause overgrowth inflame tissue . Since AAAs cause aortic wall atrophy , hypothesise confirm animal , cyclosporine AAA , administrate short period time , durably stabilize small AAA diameter animal , induce aortic wall reconstruction healing . The clinical trial ACA4 multicentric randomize , placebo control , double blind trial enrol 360 patient small AAAs France . Two dos cyclosporine A tested placebo ( three arm ) . Drug administration short , AAA diameter evaluation perform 2 year , CT-scanner ( main outcome ) contrast , duplex-scanner .</detailed_description>
