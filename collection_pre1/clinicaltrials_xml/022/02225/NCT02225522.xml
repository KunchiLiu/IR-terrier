	<brief_title>Genomic Sequencing Acutely Ill Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , blind , prospective study examine comparative effectiveness - clinical cost effectiveness - rapid NGS ( StatSeq ) , compare standard care , include expand newborn screen , acutely ill neonate infant potential genetic disease . Acutely ill neonate infant undiagnosed illness , family , eligible participate study . The investigator enroll approximately 1,000 neonate infant single study site . The study population recruit Children 's Mercy Hospital inpatient population , primarily intensive care nursery ( ICN , also know NICU ) , small subpopulation present hospital service , pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . All affect study participant receive expand newborn screen ( NBS ) . Newborn screen biochemical test heel-prick blood spot federally mandate performed US live birth . 67 disease test NBS MO , genetic disease . The expanded NBS propose herein clinically available StepOne Newborn ScreenÂ® Perkin Elmer , perform addition standard State MO screen enrolled infant arm . Half affect study participant randomize receive StatSeq addition standard test acute illness expand NBS . Additionally , willing clinical provider enrol perception clinical outcome measure . All subject blood draw nucleic acid ( DNA RNA ) isolation expand NBS time enrollment study . All blood sample volume adhere CMH policy maximum blood pediatric patient . If volume allow policy exceed 5ml , 5 ml maximum collect enrollment . Buccal smear , heel-prick blood spot , additional blood , urine tissue sample may collect , available sample retains study , store Center Pediatric Genomic Medicine ( CPGM ) per approve IRB protocol ( IRB Study # 11120514 ) . The latter sample involve invasive sampling . Nucleic acid isolate prepared NGS standard protocol CPGM ( Center Pediatric Genomic Medicine ) . Familial sample ( example , mother , father , affect unaffected sibling ) also obtain , nucleic acid also sequence per Genome Center Biorepository protocol , indicate , assist diagnosis acute medical condition newborn . All sequence data store Genome Center Biorepository ( IRB Study # 11120514 ) . A minimum two expert Center data analyst responsible analyze DNA variant follow NGS . One analyst compile report present Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director Assistant Director . In case positive study finding may diagnostic , Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director Assistant Director perform confirmatory clinical diagnostic testing , confirm , standard clinical diagnostic report place patient 's medical record . In case acutely material ( actionable ) positive study finding , result verbally conveyed primary clinical team directly prior confirmatory test . A generic research note place patient 's medical record indicate verbal , provisional report issue ( Appendix A ) . Verbal , provisional reporting result confirmatory test perform case delay report necessary confirmation likely result significant harm patient . Confirmatory test perform promptly case , include verbal report give . A case conference format may utilize return result complexity diagnosis potential treatment diagnosis warrant detailed discussion . If potentially pathogenic variant identify , verbal report provide clinical care physician record communicate causative finding , generic research note place medical record state nondiagnostic research grade NGS perform ( Appendix B ) . No negative diagnostic write report result place patient 's chart instance , available clinical grade test confirm negative result gene test . Follow patient 's family guide clinical care team . All study participant clinician notified randomization assignment at/by day 10 randomization . This information help alleviate anxiety part family , also provide mechanism patient crossover rapid NGS arm patient clinically deteriorate , clinical care team 's request . Rarely , participant clinician notify sooner randomized rapid NGS group diagnosis make less 10 day . Both molecular diagnosis make time diagnosis record primary outcome . All positive result Perkin Elmer StepOne expand NBS ( receive enrol infant NOT study variable ) return Genome Center personnel . Based result , confirmatory test Perkin Elmer perform condition identify standard State NBS screen infant . These provisional result verbally communicate primary clinician team additional sample request , necessary , confirmation . Upon confirmation , result enter patient 's medical record . Each time study participant enrol , primary clinical provider ask fill survey prior StatSeq test return result . We also review patient 's medical record collect clinical variable include laboratory testing , radiology result , medication treatment receive analyze effect rapid NGS clinical care . We plan follow family annually 5 year post enrollment record clinical outcome relate study . This study integrate two study protocol , one CMH Genomic Medicine Repository ( IRB 11120514 ) Genomes newborn ( # 13120442 ) study ethical legal implication rapid NGS population . Data record request study . The participant must agree enroll Genome Center Biorepository . The Genomes newborn study optional .</detailed_description>
