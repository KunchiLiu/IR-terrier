	<brief_summary>Background : - Some treatment cancer diseases lead infertility woman . These treatment include chemotherapy , stem cell transplant , pelvic radiotherapy . They call gonadotoxic therapy . Women egg frozen treatment . This may allow get pregnant later . Researchers want learn technology process . Objectives : - To provide egg freeze woman gonadotoxic therapy NIH . To learn effect therapy . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year old past puberty menopause . They must schedule gonadotoxic therapy . Design : - Participants screen medical history blood hormone test . They also physical exam transvaginal ultrasound . - Ovary stimulation : participant medication inject skin . These increase chance fertility . This phase take 8 20 day . Participants blood draw transvaginal ultrasound daily every day . Some participant also blood thinner injected daily . - Egg retrieval : participant check hospital . Eggs remove needle short surgery . Participants awake sedate . - Participants may stay overnight hospital . - They return every 1 3 day 1 3 week blood test . - Mature egg freeze egg retrieval immature egg ( fertilized clinical use ) use research . Participants use eggs future outside , private fertility clinic try become pregnant . If egg store 5 year , participant must pay storage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fertility Preservation Women Who Will Have Gonadotoxic Therapy Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation , Women With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment chemotherapeutic drug , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , pelvic radiotherapy cancer serious medical illness potential markedly increase risk gonadotoxicity lead infertility woman . Females post-menarchal risk factor may candidate fertility preservation oocyte cryopreservation ovarian failure ensues . For example , sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common hemoglobinopathy United States ( 3 ) . Hypoxic condition cause abnormal hemoglobin molecule undergo sickling lead painful microvascular occlusion . SCD associate multiple organ system dysfunction well neurological pulmonary complication , lead early mortality . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) treatment currently available SCD result complete cure . In patient undergone HSCT match sibling , event-free survival high 85 % -95 % . Multiple study unfortunately demonstrate infertility premature ovarian insufficiency quite common follow HSCT . Specifically patient population sickle cell disease , recently find largely preserved ovarian function prior transplantation , profound gonadotoxicity follow transplant ( unpublished ) . This underscore clinical need additional , effective fertility preservation method at-risk population .</detailed_description>
