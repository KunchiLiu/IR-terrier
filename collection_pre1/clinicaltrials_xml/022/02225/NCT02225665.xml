	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability repeat dose T-cell immunotherapy ( SB-728mR-T ) follow cyclophosphamide conditioning . CCR5 major co-receptor HIV entry T-cells . Disruption CCR5 zinc finger nuclease ( SB-728mR ) , block HIV entry T-cells , therefore , protect T-cells HIV infection . Safety ( primary outcome ) anti-viral effect ( secondary outcome ) zinc finger nuclease-mediated CCR5 disrupt autologous T-cells ( SB-728mR-T ) evaluate study .</brief_summary>
