	<brief_summary>Background : - Maculopathies eye condition affect center retina . Retina health depend RPE , layer behind retina . A new test may measure health central retina RPE . Objective : - To use focal electro-oculogram test understand central retina RPE affect maculopathies . Eligibility : - People least 10 year old maculopathy . - Healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen medical eye history eye exam . Pictures take eye . - Their eye may dilate . - They may field test . They look lens press button see light . First , may sit dark 40 minute . - Participants 1 7 visit 18 month . - Their vision test eye pressure measure . - Their pupil dilate eye drop researcher may take picture retina inside eye , measure thickness retina . - Participants electro-oculogram . They look 2 LED light follow back forth 10 second per minute . Participants darkness 15 minute light 20 minute . One skin electrode place nose one next eye . - Participants maculopathy also : - Field test . - Electroretinogram . Participants get numb eye drop special contact lens . A small metal electrode tap forehead . Participants watch flash light try blink . First , may sit dark 40 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Focal Electro-Oculogram Macular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective protocol investigate local response retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) across posterior pole eye record focal electrooculogram ( EOG ) participants macular disease . STUDY POPULATION : Up 50 healthy volunteer 80 participant , age 10 old , macular disorder affect retina/retinal pigment epithelium complex . Examples macular disorder include Stargardt disease age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . DESIGN : This single-center , observational , case-control study comprise three relate aim . The first aim focus develop focal EOG method require parameter optimization . The second aim focus establish normal range variability focal EOG normal volunteer . The third aim examine focal EOG participant macular disease . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome study develop method record focal EOG . The secondary outcome establish normal range focal EOG determine inter-session intra-session variability test . Exploratory outcomes include : 1 ) examine focal EOG participant macular disease 2 ) determine inter-session intra-session variability test participant macular disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant must 10 year age old . 2 . Participant ( legal guardian ) must understand sign protocol inform consent document . 3 . Participant must able cooperate testing require study . 4 . For Participants macular disease : 1 . Participant must macular disease , define evidence loss centrally mediate retinal dysfunction and/or degeneration establish standard clinical method include perimetry , ERG imaging . 2 . Participant must measurable visual acuity . 5 . For Healthy Volunteers : 1 . Participant must visual acuity 20/20 good least one eye . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 ) Participant preretinal medium opacity would prevent focal light presentation .</criteria>
