	<brief_summary>Background : - Differences people gene make respond drug different way . Methadone buprenorphine two drug use treat drug addiction . A study show African Americans certain genetic marker well use one kind drug treatment . Researchers want see repeat finding . They also want study thing affect well people treatment . Objective : - To see certain genetic marker fact person life predict well treatment addiction opioids cocaine . Eligibility : - African American adult age 18 . They must former current participant Archway Treatment Clinic study . They must stable dose either study drug least 12 week . They also must give urine sample regularly least 10 week . Design : - Participants come clinic 1 visit last 2 hour . - Participants give 1 teaspoon blood genetic testing . They ask sample use future study . - If researcher get enough blood , cheek swab . This collect skin cell genetic testing . - Participants fill 3 questionnaire . - Results genetic test answer questionnaire keep private .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Delta Opioid Receptor Gene ( OPRD1 ) Variations Treatment Outcome African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NIDA Clinical Trials Network ( CTN ) START Study design look pharmacogenetics treatment response . The CTN investigator find intronic SNP ( rs678849 ) gene opioid delta-1 receptor ( OPRD1 ) strongly predict treatment response African-Americans . Specifically , treatment methadone , African-Americans one variant SNP ( CC ) less likely use illicit opioids compare African-Americans variant SNP ( CT TT ) ( relative risk = 0.53 , 95 % CI 0.46-0.60 , p = 0.001 ) . During treatment buprenorphine , association reverse : African-Americans CC variant likely use illicit opioids , compare CT TT variant ( relative risk = 2.13 , 95 % CI 1.81-2.45 , p = 0.012 ) . This pattern finding unexpected , term racial specificity differential drug association . Replication new sample crucial determine whether represent real effect . Study objectives include : ( 1 ) To independently replicate pharmacogenetic NIDA CTN finding compare urine drug screen opioid result rs678849 genotype group among opioid-addicted African-American individual , treat either buprenorphine methadone ; ( 2 ) To determine whether effect rs678849 genotype varies demographic , drug use , mental health , psychosocial characteristic ; ( 3 ) To determine whether effect rs678849 genotype extend cocaine use , ( 4 ) To examine haplotype block OPRD1 might help explain association . We recruit sample n=135 ( obtain 130 completers ; 65 methadone , 65 buprenorphine ) current former participant Archway treatment study order power 0.80 detect difference 0.5 standard deviation rs678849 genotype . To eligible , participant must receive stable dose ( taper &gt; 7 day length ) buprenorphine methadone least 12 week least 10 weekly urine drug screen time . After informed consent , approximate 3-hour session , participant undergo collection blood buccal swab DNA extraction analysis ( blood prefer , buccal extraction enables inclusion participant poor venous access ) complete 3 questionnaire ; Addiction Severity Index , Perceived Neighborhood Scale , section Diagnostic Instrument Genetic Studies .</detailed_description>
