	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safe give nintedanib combination cisplatin docetaxel surgery patient NSCLC . Researchers also want learn drug combination help control NSCLC surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Study Cisplatin , Docetaxel , Nintedanib Stage IB-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant assign study group base participant join study . Up 2 group 6 participant enrol Run-In Phase study , 33 participant enrolled Expansion Phase . If participant enrol Run-In Phase , dose nintedanib participant receive depend participant join study . The first group participant receive dose level nintedanib . If intolerable side effect see , second group enrol high dose level . If intolerable side effect see , group enrol low dose level . If participant enrol Expansion Phase , participant receive nintedanib high dose tolerate Run-In Phase . All participant receive dose level cisplatin docetaxel . Study Drug Administration : Run-In Phase : Participant receive cisplatin 2 hour docetaxel 1 hour vein Day 1 21-day study cycle . Participant take nintedanib mouth every day Day 2 Cycle 1 Day 7 Cycle 3 , except day participant receive cisplatin docetaxel . Expansion Phase : Participant take capsule nintedanib mouth every day 28 day prim cycle ( Cycle 0 ) . Participant receive cisplatin 2 hour docetaxel 1 hour vein Day 1 21-day study cycle . Participant take nintedanib mouth every day Day 2 Cycle 1 Day 7 Cycle 3 , except day participant receive cisplatin docetaxel . All Patients : Participant take capsule nintedanib cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Participant swallow capsule whole chew . If participant take nintedanib 2 time daily , participant take drug 12 hour apart time . If participant miss dose , participant wait take next schedule dose due . Participant surgery least 21 day last dose nintedanib , unless study doctor think participant 's best interest . Study Visits : If participant Expansion Phase , Day 28 Cycle 0 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test biomarker test . - Participant CT scan check status disease . Within 7 day Cycles 2 3 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test biomarker test . About 14 day participant 's last cycle chemotherapy : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test biomarker test . - Participant PET/CT CT scan check status disease . Some blood draw and/or image scan may need perform frequently certain side effect ( affect liver ) occur . Surgery : Between 3 5 week participant stop take study drug , participant surgery remove disease . Participant sign separate consent form explain procedure , well risk benefit . During surgery , tissue sample remove collect stored research tissue bank MD Anderson use future biomarker research research related cancer . Length Treatment : Participant may receive study drug 3 cycle , follow surgery . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Active participation study end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 8 week surgery , follow test procedure perform : Â°Participant physical exam blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker test . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , participant 's medical record review participant call , contact writing , e-mailed check participant 's health status . If participant call , call last 5 minute . Participant may also ask question regularly schedule clinic visit . The follow-up period last long study doctor think information need . This investigational study . Docetaxel cisplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment NSCLC . Nintedanib commercially available FDA approve treatment idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( type lung disease ) . Its use study investigational . Up 45 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 year old 2 . Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer . Patients suspect lung cancer eligible , pathology must confirm prior initiating treatment study . Neuroendocrine carcinoma eligible . Carcinomas neuroendocrine differentiation eligible . 3 . Stage IB ( primary tumor &gt; /= 4cm ) , IIA , IIB , IIIA ( accord AJCC 7th edition ) . Patients stage IIIA must one mediastinal lymph node station involve tumor . 4 . All patient must lymph node evaluation contralateral station 2 and/or 4 exclude N3 disease . 5 . The patient must suitable candidate surgery , opinion treat physician . 6 . ECOG performance status score 01 7 . Signed date write informed consent prior admission study accordance ICHGCP guideline local legislation 1 . Prior systemic therapy radiation therapy treatment current lung cancer 2 . Known hypersensitivity trial drug excipients 3 . Centrally locate tumor radiographic evidence ( CT MRI ) local invasion major blood vessel 4 . Major injury within past 10 day prior start study treatment incomplete wind heal 5 . History clinically significant haemorrhagic thromboembolic event past 6 month 6 . Known inherited predisposition bleed thrombosis 7 . Significant cardiovascular disease ( i.e . uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , history infarction within past 12 month prior start study treatment , congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II , serious cardiac arrhythmia , pericardial effusion ) 8 . Creatinine &gt; 1.5 upper limit normal . Patients creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 cc/min ( calculate use Cockcroft Gault equation ) eligible 9 . Hepatic function : total bilirubin &gt; institutional upper limit normal AST &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal 10 . Coagulation parameter : International normalise ratio ( INR ) &gt; 2 , prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &gt; 50 % deviation institutional ULN 11 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1500/ml , and/or platelet &lt; 100000/ml 12 . Prior malignancy require systemic therapy radiation therapy within 1 year randomization 13 . Active serious infection particular require systemic antibiotic antimicrobial therapy 14 . Known disease history active chronic hepatitis C and/or B infection 15 . Gastrointestinal disorder abnormality would interfere absorption study drug 16 . Serious illness concomitant nononcological disease neurologic , psychiatric , infectious disease laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study 17 .
