	<brief_summary>The objective research test hypothesis participate group-based gardening activity alters brain network activation function , change occur brain form neurobiological basis much nonphysical activity portion therapeutic benefit garden horticultural therapy . Assessment effect garden activity experimental population take two approach , first use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) ass region brain may become activated consequence experience cumulative gardening activity associate stimuli . The allied approach employ widely use well-established self-reported assessment instrument capture information health well-being provide psychometrically-based physical health summary participant control group engage gardening activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal project well understand interact work plant group garden activity program take place greenhouse effect pattern brain activity overall health well-being . There essentially assessment effect garden engage gardening activity brain activity use functional MRI ( fMRI ) approach . This study employ visual stimuli ass effect garden activity treatment Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) responses reveal fMRI study subject comparison response engage garden intervention program . Specifically study seek determine whether engage gardening activity take place greenhouse influence brain activity function , result change overall quality life status subject wellness population . The total study population ( N = 23 ) consist 11 healthy woman control group , 12 healthy woman treatment group . There fMRI brain scan psychometric pre- post-intervention assessment administer study subject . The fMRI psychometric assessment administer within 10 day prior start intervention , within 10 day follow completion treatment intervention . The control group continue normal daily life seven eight week interval , receive intervention . The treatment group divide two group six woman receive garden intervention different day week . The participant treatment group receive experimental intervention consist 12 gardening session , approximately 60 minute duration six week treatment period . Each gardening session take place time day twice week , follow standardize programming sequence ensure equivalency intervention across garden session . Ambient environmental condition greenhouse garden session monitor record . The gardening activity emphasize grow plant seed , plant propagation technique , transplant , plant-mediated taste , visual , olfactory touch sensory stimulation . All gardening session begin short educational module introduce plant garden activity take place session . In addition pre- post-intervention assessment , psychometric assessment administer depression mood state specific time point garden activity treatment group evaluate change time result intervention .</detailed_description>
