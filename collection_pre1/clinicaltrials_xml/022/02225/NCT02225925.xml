	<brief_title>Intraoperative Dosimetry Prostate Brachytherapy Using Fluoroscopy Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use brachytherapy implantation radioactive source prostate adenocarcinoma advantage external beam radiation high dose deliver tumor limit dos surround normal tissue ( i.e. , bowel bladder ) . It establish outcomes treatment brachytherapy related technical quality source placement within gland . Accurate placement radioactive source achievement optimum dose distribution within prostate key success brachytherapy regard kill tumor well minimize toxicity . Due factor deformation prostate needle insertion , needle deviation intend path insertion , prostatic edema needle trauma , relaxation tissue well source migration needle removal , actual source position upon completion procedure may fail accurately match intend placement , result variation idealize dosimetric plan . One way overcome complex problem capability visualize source prostate continuously update dosimetric plan real time . To end , develop mechanism whereby ultrasound fluoroscopy quantitatively integrated allow real-time visualization source position intraoperatively . A prior Phase I study perform group evaluate prototype version mechanism , result successful treatment 6 patient true intraoperative dynamic dosimetry . Dosimetric outcomes within cohort patient excellent , intraoperative dos predict system accurate predict current standard method ( ultrasound-based dosimetry ) .</detailed_description>
