	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) immunologically mediate chronic illness relapse remit course , commonly present 2nd 3rd decade cause lifelong impairment health quality life . Mainstay clinical treatment severe disease combination anti-inflammatory agent like 5-aminosalicyaltes immunosuppressive medication like corticosteroid new anti-TNF antibody like Infliximab . None drug , present , curative relevant subset patient refractory many pharmacologic approach . Immunoablative treatment follow autologous stem cell rescue ( Autologous HSCT ) try refractory group patient successful result . Autologous HSCT effective auto-immune set eradication effector/memory T-cell clone due direct immuno-ablative effect drug use preparative regimen ; lead immune-reset- recover clone T- cell infused stem cell mount auto- immune response tolerant 'self ' antigen , upregulation T regulatory cell ( Treg , CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ CD8+ FOXP3+ ) via change cytokine mileu transplant . Increased population Tregs restrict activity self-reactive effector T-cells . This pilot study design gain success previously publish adult study autologous HSCT refractory CD , aim confirm feasibility , safety efficacy HSCT post-transplant cyclophosphamide give post-HSCT pediatric patient young adult . Since , combination immuno-ablative therapy post-transplant cyclophosphamide extensively study child CD , therefore transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) severe toxicity ( &gt; grade 3 toxicity NCI criterion ) monitor 100 day post-transplant patient stop rule enforce case excessive toxicity TRM ( &gt; 10 % ) . Clinical assessment do 1 year post-HSCT disease activity , steroid free remission period evaluate 'clinical efficacy ' procedure . The major aim pilot generate preliminary safety data confirm feasibility benefit autologous HSCT child young adult refractory CD . Study Design : This single arm , pilot study design estimate feasibility , safety benefit immunoablation hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) use autologous stem cell follow administration post-transplant cyclophosphamide child young adult refractory Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . The study population patient severe refractory Crohn 's disease ≥10 ≤ 30 year age . Objectives : Primary Objective : To determine feasibility toxicity immunoablation HSCT post-HSCT infusion cyclophosphamide child young adult refractory Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Death ( transplant relate mortality , TRM ) severe non-hematologic toxicity ( ≥ grade 3 toxicity ; NCI Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 ) within first 100 day HSCT monitor meet end-point . Secondary Objectives : Secondary objective evaluation incidence HSCT related complication evaluation response . These include : 1 . Incidence viral reactivations - CMV EBV 2 . Incidence invasive fungal infection 3 . Immune reconstitution HSCT lymphocyte subpopulation ( absolute number CD3 , CD4 , CD8 CD19 cell ) , immunoglobulin level ( IgG ) CD4+ CD25+ CD127+ regulatory T cell ( Treg ) population day +30 , +60 , +100 , day +180 yearly post-HSCT . 4 . Evaluate efficacy benefit HSCT population 1 year post HSCT , serial assessment clinical activity CD , assessment disease severity- CDAI score length steroid free remission . Hypotheses : Primary : The HSCT post-transplant cyclophosphamide regimen well tolerate acceptable toxicity lead &lt; 10 % transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) . Background Rationale : Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic illness immunologically mediate , unknown etiology , probably induced exposure intestinal bacteria component antigens lead excessive T helper type 1 ( TH-1 ) mediate chronic inflammation gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract 1 . Crohn 's disease relapse remit disorder commonly present 2nd 3rd decade cause lifelong impairment health quality life 2 . Regardless therapy use patient remain seriously ill active disease multiple therapeutic option exhaust . In addition , patient refractory disease suffer inability eat , frequent nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malnutrition , growth retardation , fistulae formation , abdominal pain psychological distress , ileostomy colostomy , multiple surgery may lead short-gut syndrome , severely affect quality life . Though well characterize , distinct excessive mortality exists group patient 3,4 . Patients refractory CD high mortality rate compare normal population ( hazard ratio 1.73 ) ; death usually related surgical complication , liver disease , infection intestinal cancer long term survivor 5 . Even though overall mortality low group patient , suffer significant morbidity , cortico-steroid side effect poor quality life 50 % patient refractory disease need surgical intervention ( ileostomy , colostomy ) affect complication rate 2,3 . Many drug use control symptoms CD , drug , present , curative relevant subset patient refractory many pharmacologic approach 6 . Almost drug employ advanced form disease , immunosuppressives immunomodulators , potential risk . Mainstay clinical treatment combination anti- inflammatory agent like 5-aminosalicyaltes immunosuppressive medication like corticosteroids4 . Majority patient severe refractory disease treat anti- Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) antibody like Infliximab ( Remicade ) , limited option exist patient fail respond anti-TNF therapy7 . Approximately 40 % patient CD develop intolerable side effect fail respond anti-TNF therapy , hence significant population subset patient option limit 8 . Some symptom may control prolonged steroid , many know long term effect continue steroid use- muscle loss , osteopenia , cataracts cushingoid habitus . Majority patient enroll experimental Phase I/II drug trial resort surgical intervention control symptom . Surgical approach ( partial gut resection inflame segment ileo-colostomy ) option , associate infection risk , psycho-social cosmetic issue increase morbidity due short gut syndrome , especially young adult . Increased mortality also associate surgical intervention 2,3 . Therefore , intervention avoids surgery long term corticosteroid young adult may beneficial . Given hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) value auto-immune disease characterize loss immune tolerance TH-1 predominant immune response , possible procedure could value CD 9,10 . Autologous transplantation might also benefit clear body commit lymphocyte clone might restore patient status quo ante predispose CD suffer 11 . Rationale HSCT CD HSCT may provide benefit auto-immune disease : 1 . Eradication effector/memory T-cell clone due direct immuno-ablative effect drug use preparative regimen . 2 . Immune-reset : recovering clone T-cells infused stem cell mount auto-immune response tolerant 'self ' antigen . 3 . Upregulation T regulatory cell ( Treg , CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ CD8+ FOXP3+ ) - change cytokine mileu transplant . Increased population Tregs restrict activity self-reactive effector T-cells . 4 . Engraftment uncommitted stem cell gut mucosa may lead direct heal mucosa . Evidence effectiveness HSCT Crohn 's disease Initial observation make patient Crohn 's disease hematologic malignancy . For patient underwent HSCT hematologic malignancy remission Crohn 's disease 12 . Several study report clinical course patient Crohn 's disease receive autologous transplantation another condition . Perhaps interesting concerned patient develop symptom age 9 , diagnose Crohn 's disease 4 year later require substantial treatment next 7 year 13 . Following autologous stem cell transplantation non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma report clinical laboratory evidence recurrence Crohn 's disease next 7 year . Another report case Crohn 's disease diffuse pan colitis transplantation asymptomatic ( inflammation ) endoscopy 3 year later 14 . Another patient symptomatic Crohn 's disease 2 year undergone surgery free disease 5 year transplantation . Systematic colonoscopic evaluation show persist subclinical inflammation initially progressive clearance . At Vanderbilt perform unrelated donor transplant patient AML Crohn 's disease . He currently 10 year post-transplant symptom Crohn 's disease . HSCT specifically Crohn 's disease : The first report stem cell transplantation Crohn 's disease concern 2 patient Chicago group 15 . In initial case Crohn 's disease activity index 250 ( normal range &lt; 150 , pathological range 220 - 600 ) despite treatment infliximab . In patient , peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) mobilize use cyclophosphamide granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) , enrich ex-vivo CD 34+ selection . Cyclophosphamide antithyomcyte globulin ( ATG ) use immune conditioning prior transplantation . The first patient 22 year old woman past history right hemicolectomy severe ileocolic Crohn 's disease cause intractable diarrhea 25 bowel action per day , fistula peri-anal sepsis . The second 16 year old boy unwell 6 year require tube feed receive methotrexate , 6-mercaptopurine 5 amino acyclic acid Crohn 's colitis . In case , follow transplantation , diarrhea resolve Crohn 's disease activity index normalize . In first patient haemoglobin rise , whereas second remain slightly sub-normal level . Post-transplantation CRP within normal limit albumin remain become normal . These case accompany extensive colonoscopic evidence disease activity . Prior transplantation case area severely active Crohn 's disease cobble stoning , fissure deep ulceration . Following transplantation bowel remain abnormal though change much trivial superficial erosion . Oyama et al report autologous HSCT 12 patient median age 27 ( 15-38 ) severe refractory Crohn 's disease 16 . The condition regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/kg ) equine ATG ( 90 mg/kg ) . Eleven 12 patient enter sustained remission define CDAI &lt; 150 . After median follow-up 18.5 month ( range , 7-37 month ) , one patient develop recurrence active CD , occur 15 month HSCT . Hasselbatt et al report autologous HSCT 12 patient ( age 24-50 ) refractory Crohn 's disease use high dose cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/kg ) without ATG 17 . PBSC harvest follow mobilization chemotherapy successful 11/12 patient result clinical endoscopic improvement 7/12 patient . Subsequent conditioning autoPBSCT perform nine patient relatively well tolerate . Among , five patient achieve clinical endoscopic remission within 6 month autoPBSCT . However , relapse occur 7/9 patient follow-up , disease activity could control low-dose corticosteroid conventional immunosuppressive therapy . In 2010 Burt et al report autologous HSCT 24 patient mean age 24 year ( range 15-52 ) anti-TNF refractory Crohn 's disease 18 . Stem cell mobilize peripheral blood use cyclophosphamide ( 2.0 g/m2 ) G-CSF ( 10 ug/kg/day ) , enrich ex vivo CD34 selection , reinfused immune suppressive conditioning cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/kg ) either equine antithymocyte globulin ( ATG , 90 mg/kg ) rabbit ATG ( 6 mg/kg ) . Eighteen 24 patient 5 year transplantation . All patient go remission CDAI le 150 . The percentage clinical relapse-free survival define percent free restart CD medical therapy transplantation 91 % 1 year , 63 % 2 year , 57 % 3 year , 39 % 4 year , 19 % 5 year . The percentage patient remission ( CDAI &lt; 150 ) , steroid-free , medication-free posttransplantation evaluation interval 5 year transplantation remain great 70 % , 80 % , 6 % respectively . Regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) Auto-immune disease : Regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) implicate suppression immune response maintenance tolerance 19,20 . The percentage CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cell ( T regs ) significantly decrease patient auto-immune disease like SLE Type 1 diabetes 20 . Also , transfer Treg prevent auto-immune phenotype develop Treg depletion animal model . During HSCT auto-immune disease , increase Treg population correlate remission induction . Zhang et.al show HSCT lead newly generate population Treg cell maintain patient true immunological remission 21 . Burt et.al , also evaluate role Treg cell patient underwent HSCT CD . Before HSCT mean % Treg cell significantly low CD patient ( 2.62 % ± 2.01 % ) , compare normal volunteer ( 3.86 % ± 1.67 % ) . A robust increase % Treg observe HSCT , sustain period time may contribute relapse 18 . Hence , clinical evidence sustain increase Treg population may maintain remission patient auto-immune disorder . Rationale propose Study : This pilot study design estimate feasibility HSCT safety post-HSCT cyclophosphamide infusion patient refractory disease fail respond Infliximab/and immunosuppressive agent . This design small pilot study build 'stopping rule ' case excessive toxicity death . Rationale immuno-ablative regimen : Rationale CY mobilization : Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) use mobilization peripheral stem cell immuno-ablation prior HSCT . CY traditionally use mobilization HSCT refractory CD . Rationale post-transplant Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) - Recently , use post-transplant CY pioneer John Hopkins show effective GVHD prophylaxis patient undergo HSCT hematologic malignancy , even set HLA mismatch haploidentical donor . Post-transplant delivery CY allow effective deletion proliferate allo-reactive T- cell cause GVHD without add toxicity regimens 22 . In recent study Hopkins group post-transplant cyclophosphamide successfully use patient sickle cell disease undergo haploidentical bone marrow transplant toxicity . Some study perform CD34+ stem cell selection get rid immune-reactive T- cell clone use purified CD34+ infusion regenerate immune system 18 . The problem approach delay immune-reconstitution post-transplant high incidence infection . European trial use un-manipulated peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) infusion ( without T cell depletion CD34+ selection ) SCT auto-immune disease 23 . Since , peripheral stem cell contain T cell clone immuno-reactive infuse along donor stem cell non-T cell deplete infusion , may one reason relapse T cell replete HSCT do till date CD . Therefore , overcome above-mentioned issue , propose use un-manipulated PBSCs , give two dos CY pre- two dos post-stem cell infusion effectively deplete immuno-reactive T cell clone present autologous infusion therefore , decrease incidence relapse . The total dose CY remain ( 200 mg/kg ) , therefore , add toxicity regimen , may lead effective depletion immune- reactive clone , obviate need costly in-vitro T cell depletions/CD34+ selection . Also , CY cause sustain depletion T cell subset , profound depletion CD4+ CD25- subset , result relative enrichment CD4+CD25+ cell , hope expand use post-transplant cyclophosphamide . Rationale Rabbit-ATG ( Thymoglobulin , Genzyme Corp , Cambridge , MA ) : also use effective immune-ablation in-vivo T cell depletion post- stem cell infusion . Rabbit ATG use show promote expansion functional Tregs in-vitro 24 . Rabbit ATG use large study Burt et al 18 . ( Please note reference number find page 25-26 protocol . )</detailed_description>
