	<detailed_description>Self monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) insulin treat type 1 type 2 diabetic consistently demonstrate confer benefit , consider essential part management diabetes . In China , utilization SMBG among diabetes patient low . Even among perform SMBG regularly , daily test frequency fall short recommend international national clinical guideline . There thus need create awareness benefit SMBG time establish SMBG regimen deem practically feasible cost effective diabetes patient .
