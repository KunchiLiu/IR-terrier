	<brief_summary>People spinal cord injury ( SCI ) among least physically active group society . Approximately 1 4 healthy young person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) sufficient fitness perform many essential activity daily live . About 50 % people SCI engage leisure time physical activity . That , wheel walk pleasure , n't play sport , n't exercise home go gym . As result , cardiovascular , endocrine metabolic condition adversely affect health large segment SCI population . Fortunately , clinic and/or laboratory-based aerobic conditioning circuit training study provide compel evidence people SCI improve cardiorespiratory fitness partially reverse cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , enhance Quality Life ( QOL ) improve element subjective well-being . While intensive , clinic-based , supervised exercise program improve fitness health person SCI , value finding SCI population limit vast majority people access specialize program facility . The gap present study address : How extend benefit increase exercise physical activity people SCI ? The goal study evaluate feasibility individually tailor , home- community-based , telephone deliver intervention use evidence-based behavioral motivational counseling increase daily physical activity exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Telephone Counseling Increase Physical Fitness SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomize control trial compare 16 session telephone intervention aim increase physical activity usual care . Participants agree join study meet eligibility criterion ask follow thing course 6 month . BASELINE ASSESSMENT ( Part 1 2 ) : For participant meet screening eligibility criterion , two-part baseline assessment schedule University Washington Medical Center Clinical Research Center . During Part 1 visit , participant complete interview , medical test receive DXA scan . After complete Part 1 baseline , participant give activity monitor wear home one week . Approximately seven day complete Part 1 baseline , participant complete Part 2 . Part 2 consist cardiorespiratory fitness test . A healthcare monitor available throughout test help ensure safety . POST BASELINE FOLLOW-UP : There 3 possible outcome follow baseline assessment . 1 . Individuals may eligible study medical condition need treatment ( example , diabetes hypertension ) . Individuals qualify study randomize ( like flip coin ) either usual care group physical activity intervention group . Participants equal chance end either group . 2 . Participants may randomize usual care group receive physical activity coach telephone . 3 . Participants may randomize physical activity coach intervention group . The physical activity coach contact participant within one week begin 6 month intervention . 2 AND 4 MONTH ASSESSMENT ( 10 minute ) : All participant , regardless group assignment , ask complete telephone interview research team two four month complete baseline . Interviews consist question regard physical activity level barrier related exercise . 6-MONTH OUTCOME ASSESSMENT ( Part 1 2 ) : After six month , participant ask return University Washington Medical Center Clinical Research Center complete 6-month outcome assessment . The 6-month outcome assessment identical baseline assessment . During Part 1 visit , participant complete interview , medical test DXA scan . After complete Part 1 6-month outcome assessment , participant give activity monitor wear home one week . Approximately seven day complete Part 1 6-month outcome assessment , participant complete Part 2 . During Part 2 visit , participant undergo cardiorespiratory fitness test . A healthcare monitor available throughout test help ensure safety .</detailed_description>
