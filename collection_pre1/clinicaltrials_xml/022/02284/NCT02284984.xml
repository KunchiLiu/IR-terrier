	<detailed_description>Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) affect predominantly young woman childbearing potential ( 20-40 year ) inflammation occur virtually every organ , include kidney , lung , heart brain . The disease course SLE patient typically characterized frequent flare , require immunosuppressive treatment . Current , evidence-based treatment modality SLE consist immunosuppressive treatment high dose corticosteroid , cyclophosphamide mycophenolic mycophenolate acid , non-specifically target immune system reduce inflammation . Side-effects treatment strategy ( opportunistic ) infection short term risk malignancy cardiovascular disease long-term . Treating SLE patient biologicals attractive alternative biologicals specifically target immune system block cytokine deplete one specific cell population , thereby reduce risk infection malignancy compare conventional immunosuppressant . Furthermore , scarce treatment option underscore need exploit new therapeutic possibility SLE patient frequently experience flare disease . These consideration lead present study involve proof-of-concept study refractory SLE patient assess immunological consequence combination treatment rituximab ( anti-CD20 ) belimumab ( anti-BAFF ) . Objective study : A proof-of-concept study refractory SLE patient assess immunological consequence combination treatment rituximab ( anti-CD20 ) belimumab ( anti-BAFF ) achieve long-term B-cell depletion . The immunological clinical monitoring refractory SLE patient monitor safety feasibility combination treatment evaluate . Study design : This single-center , non-randomized , phase 2A , proof-of-concept study evaluate effect combination treatment rituximab belimumab . This combination therapy design induce long-term B-cell depletion achieve significant reduction autoantibody-mediated immune complex . In addition standard therapy , SLE patient receive 2 infusion rituximab 1000 mg day 0 14 ( week 2 ) belimumab day 28 ( week 4 ) , 42 ( week 6 ) 56 ( week 8 ) , every 28 day . The primary endpoint 24 week extend follow-up take place , subject continue belimumab , 104 week treatment start . Rituximab Belimumab administer intravenously accord manufacturer 's instruction . Clinical immunological parameter assess every 8-12 week . The study medication blind patient physician . The study intend include 15 refractory SLE patient . Study population : Patients systemic lupus erythematosus , old 18 year refractory disease specify inclusion criterion ( mention ) Intervention : Rituximab Patients intravenously treat Rituximab 1000mg day 0 day 14 . Before every infusion Rituximab patient receive intravenous hydrocortisone 100mg together oral acetaminophen 1000 mg intravenous Tavegil 2 mg. Belimumab Patients intravenously treat Belimumab 10mg/kg day 28 , day 42 day 56 . Thereafter , patient receive Belimumab 10mg/kg every 4 week . No pre-medication administer Primary study parameters/outcome study : In proof-of-concept study primary objective ass whether combination treatment rituximab belimumab lead sustain reduction pathogenic autoantibody . Secondary study parameters/outcome study : The main secondary objective evaluate effect long-term B-cell depletion involve assessment clinical response correlate immunological parameter . To end , relevant study parameter evaluate 4 week ( short term ) , 24 week ( intermediate term ) 104 week ( long-term ) . The safety feasibility combination treatment accord WHO toxicity criteria The clinical response refractory SLE patient upon long-term B-cell depletion : - reduction SLEDAI score , new BILAG ( British Isles Lupus Assessment Group ) A involvement SLE responder index - case lupus nephritis : number partial complete renal responder - number moderate severe flare renal flare</detailed_description>

ANA seropositivity , define positive ANAtiter = 1:80 , screen : Positive test result 2 independent time point within study screening period ; OR One positive historical test result 1 positive result screen period . Historical documentation positive test ANA ( eg , ANA HEp2 titer , ANA ELISA ) must include date test . 6 . AntiDNA seropositivity , define positive antidsDNA serum antibody = 30 IU/mL , screening : Positive test result 2 independent time point within study screen period .
