	<brief_summary>Research question : Population study : woman diagnose term pregnancy labor ( control ) group diagnose preterm labor ( case ) . Intervention : measuring uterine natural killer cell . Outcome : uterine natural killer cell role initiation preterm labor . Research hypothesis : • Are uterine Natural Killer cell involve initiation preterm labor ? Medical Application : • Possibility prediction preterm labor assessment Natural killer cell well prevent preterm labor suppress activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Are Uterine Natural Killer Cells Involved Initiation Preterm Labor ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type Study : This case control study . Study Settings : This clinical trial conduct Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital laboratory work do Ain Shams University histopathology Laboratory , period August 2012 August 2014 . Study Population : The patient recruit woman attend casualty Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital . The included patient Divided two group : - Group 1 : Patients threaten preterm labor receive tocolysis patient either respond tocolysis deliver preterm respond tocolysis deliver term . - Group 2 : Patient deliver vaginally term history tocolysis preterm labor current pregnancy . Intervention : After take informed write consent , recruit patient subject follow : - History taking , particular emphasis : Past medical history ( diabetes mellitus , hypertension , etc.. ) Past obstetric history ( history preterm labor ) . Menstrual history ( sure LMP ( last menstrual period ) date reliable ) . - Having early ultrasound document gestational age . - History labor pain become regular frequent . - No suggestive history preterm prelabor rupture membranes - General examination particular emphasis blood pressure , weight height . - Abdominal examination particular emphasis uterine activity . - Obstetric ultrasound ( transabdominal ) document viability pregnancy ensure gestational age . - Included patient receive tocolysis ( accord Ain Shams University Maternity hospital protocol recommend usage calcium channel blocker ( Nifedipine ) Initially 10mg orally every 15 minute , 4 dos Nifedipine stop contraction . After slow release nifedipine . It find 8 hourly dosage 40mg - 20mg - 40mg calcium channel blocker suitable woman . This addition use steroid enhance lung maturity ( dexamethasone , 6 mg intramuscular /12 hr 48 hr ) - Patients trace fetal monitor uterine tocodynamometer ( Oxford Sonicaid Team ® ) monitor uterine contraction treatment successful . - After delivery placental sample take either patient delivered preterm term ( term patient either control term group patient successful treatment preterm labor ) . The placental sample take part decidua sample fixed 10 % neutral-buffered formalin 24-48 h , routinely process , embed paraffin wax , section 3 μm thickness , mount 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane -coated slide . Serial section immunostained CD 16 CD56 . immunohistochemistry study do Ain Shams Maternity Hospital Histopathology department .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Maternal age : 1835 year old ( decrease incidence preterm labor relate age factor ) . 2 . Women present viable pregnancy ( 28 37 week ' gestation ) , threaten preterm labor ( defined ≥ 2 uterine contraction 2837 week ' gestation , The onset labor may determine documented uterine contraction ( least one every 10 minute ) rupture fetal membrane document cervical change estimate length le 1cm cervical dilation 2 cm . Threatened preterm labor may diagnose documented uterine contraction evidence cervical change . 1 . Multiple pregnancy . 2 . Documented uterine anomaly . 3 . Oligohydramnios polyhydramnios . 4 . Medical disorder Diabetes mellitus hypertension . 5 . Preterm premature rupture membrane . 6 . Conditions may influence immune reaction e.g . history chorioamnionitis . 7 . Smoking risk factor preterm labor . 8 . Patients Autoimmune disorder may affect Uterine NK ( natural killer ) cell level .</criteria>
