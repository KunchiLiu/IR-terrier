	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common cancer many country : Italy 48.000 new breast cancer diagnose every year , despite improvement diagnosis therapy , 13.000 woman die every year disease . About 6-7 % breast cancer patient metastatic diagnosis , majority patient stage IV previous history breast cancer already treat . According various prognostic factor ( tumor size , lymph node involvement , grading , hormone receptor status , HER-2 status ) , worst-case scenario , 30 % node-negative breast cancer patient 70 % node-positive patient relapse2 . The evolution metastatic breast cancer change considerably last year approval new drug . In fact , already 2003 Giordano et al show prognosis metastatic breast cancer patient improve significantly 1970 's 2000 median survival 15 month early 1970 's compare 60 month last 1990 's . This significant survival gain obtain introduction new drug hormonal , chemotherapeutic biological agent . The great availability drug lead increase number line treatment receive metastatic breast cancer patient . However , publish data actual duration metastatic breast cancer treatment . Moreover , evidence support real impact survival treatment beyond second-third line . Recently , retrospective analysis 199 metastatic breast cancer patient treat chemotherapy show tumor subtype associate duration number line chemotherapy ( example HER positive versus `` triple-negative '' patient ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Medical Treatments MBC Patients According Biological Subtype Line Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate duration metastatic breast cancer treatment ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy biological therapy ) accord biological subtype ( Luminal A , Luminal B , HER2 positive , triple-negative ) evaluate number line metastatic breast cancer treatment accord biological subtype ( Luminal A , Luminal B , HER2 positive , triple-negative ) . The secondary Objectives evaluate overall survival accord duration number line metastatic breast cancer treatment identify predictive factor number line treatment example age , treatment response , biological subtype , metastatic site , etc identify possible element different treatment management participate site . The aim retrospective prospective study identify duration treatment ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy biological therapy ) accord biological subtype line treatment metastatic breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
