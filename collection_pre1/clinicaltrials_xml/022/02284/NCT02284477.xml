	<brief_summary>- Phthalate endocrine disrupt chemical , work anti-androgenic agent . - Phthalate mainly use PVC plasticizer easily find commonly use product electronic device , paint , lubricant , surfactant , medical supply , spray etc . Especially , PVC blood bag use blood transfusion report high level phthalate concentration . - Previous study report urinary concentration phthalate metabolite HOMA ( Homeostatic model assessment , indicator insulin resistance ) positive association . - Previous study also report negative association urinary phthalate concentration pulmonary function . - Exposure phthalates occur mainly oral route . Food wrap phthalate containing package material expect one major contributor phthalate exposure . - In present trial , investigator examine whether increased phthalate exposure consume beverage store PVC contain pack material actually effect insulin resistance , pulmonary function epigenetic feature . - For aim , investigator conduct cross-over trial .</brief_summary>
