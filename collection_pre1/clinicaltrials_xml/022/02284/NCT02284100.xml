	<brief_summary>The relationship human being animal , especially dog , exist thousand year . Historically , animal hold important role relationship provide company , stimulus motivation . Animals excellent company , since visitation discriminate segregate person , , free prejudice . In spite long-lasting presence companion animal human life , idea interaction animal may exert positive effect human health rather recent . The American Veterinary Medical Association classify therapeutic animal assist intervention ( AAI ) three category : animal assisted activity ( AAA ) utilize companion animal ; animal assist therapy ( AAT ) utilize therapy animal service animal program ( SAP ) utilize service animal . AAT particular , goal-directed intervention animal meet specific criterion integral part treatment process . AAT technically define use trained animal train health professional facilitate specific , measurable goal individual patient documentation progress . Interest AAT fuel study support many health benefit . AAT proven useful adjunct variety setting include mental health facility , nurse home hospital study perform adult patient variable intervention , goal , patient characteristic patient need . In study , AAT result significant reduction anxiety , agitation fear . In child , AAT dog decrease distress painful medical procedure , promote calmness child post-traumatic stress disorder increase attention positive behavior child pervasive developmental disorder . Surgical procedure hospitalization stressful child parent associate pain , helplessness , fear boredom . AAT show facilitate child 's ability cope hospitalization , date , study AAT benefit pediatric surgery report . The purpose study well understand effect AAT program neurological , cardiovascular endocrinological response stress pain immediate post-operative period child undergo surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Animal-assisted Therapy Pediatric Surgery : Post-operative Benefits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interest animal-assisted therapy fuel study support many health benefit adult pediatric age . The purpose study study impact AAT program cardiovascular , neurological endocrinological response stress pain immediate post-operative period follow pediatric surgery . Forty immunocompetent child undergo surgical procedure ( include orchidopexy , inguinal umbilical hernia repair , circumcision , varicocele treatment ) sequentially enrol . This randomised open-label , control , pilot study . The different arm consist experimental group AAT session surgical procedure control group standard care surgery . The study variable determine patient independently assign group , experimental intervention , researcher unblinded patient 's group . The outcome study define impact AAT neurological , cardiovascular endocrinological sign , response stress pain child undergo surgical procedure . As outcome measure investigator consider : - neurological impact , difference prevalence beta ( &gt; 14 Hz ) electroencephalogram ( EEG ) activity intervention control group ( 20-23 ) ; - autonomic impact , difference blood pressure ( BP ) intervention control group ; - cardiac impact , difference heart rate ( HR ) intervention control group ; - respiratory impact , difference oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) intervention control group ; - cerebral oxygenation , difference prefrontal oxygenation ( HbO2 ) near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) intervention control group ; - endocrinological impact , difference salivary cortisol level , intervention control group . The Wong-Baker Faces pain scale ( FPS ) use measure child 's self-reported pain . At admission , auxological examination child include measurement height , weight body mass index . Height measurement perform patient upright position , without shoe , heel together , arm extend side body head position parallel floor . Weight measure child barefooted wear light clothes , stand upright centre scale platform arm extend side body . BMI calculate body weight kilogram divide body height square meter . EEG activity , cerebral prefrontal oxygenation , heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , salivary cortisol level , face pain scale consider indicator neurological , cardiovascular endocrinological response stress pain . Data collection perform following phase : - parameter , post-operatively baseline ( T1 ) , two hour surgery re-admission Unit . Pre dog-intervention AAT-group ; - parameter , twenty minute follow T1 ( T2 ) . During dog-intervention AAT-group . For STAND-group , child ask sit quietly ; - salivary cortisol level , 11 pm midnight ( T3 , time cortisol normally low ) Vitals sign HR , BP , SpO2 , HbO2 monitor ( Dräger Primus ® ) record follow : - T1 ( every 5 minute , 10 minute . Mean value use statistical analysis ) ; - T2 ( every 5 minute , 20 minute . Mean value use statistical analysis ) . Endocrinological parameter Salivary cortisol level measure T1 , T2 T3 . The saliva sample collect use standardized salivette frozen -20° analysis laboratory . After thaw , salivary fluid centrifugate precipitate mucin cortisol assay supernatant solid-phase radioimmunoassay , wherein 125-I label cortisol competes fix time cortisol biological sample ( The Coat-A-Count Cortisol , Siemens , Los Angeles , CA ) . Pain response The face pain scale use measure child 's self-reported pain T1 end T2 . This scale consist 6 cartoon face vary expression range happy sad . The child rat pain intensity scale , point 0 pain point 10 bad pain . Analgesic treatment first 12 hour post-intervention record . Electroencephalogram Regarding AAT-group patient , EEG record obtain child awake , 2 hour surgery AAT intervention . In STAND-group patient , EEG record make 2 hour surgery . Any change normal physiological structure EEG , correlate effect anaesthesia , post-operative stress AAT intervention record monitor . In case , protocol include EEG record taste 20 minute , awake , open close eye . Parental permission obtain write oral informed consent . Written assent patient also obtain child eight year age old enrolment . Statistical analysis A desired sample size 20 patient per group total 40 subject determine base 80 % power alpha=0.10 ( pilot study ) , use 2-tailed test , detect effect size 0.8 primary endpoint measure continuous scale , absolute difference prevalence primary endpoint 31 34 % expect prevalence control group 5 10 % respectively . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation ( SD ) median quartile categorical variable count percentage . The prevalence EEG beta activity compare Fisher exact test . To test effect AAT vital sign endocrinological parameter time two group , regression model repeat measure use , include main effect group time , well interaction . Distribution pain score end session two group compare Fisher exact test . A 2-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use Stata 13.1 ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas , USA ) .</detailed_description>
