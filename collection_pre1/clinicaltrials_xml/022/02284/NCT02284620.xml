	<brief_summary>Post-operative pain total knee arthroplasty usually severe impair functional recovery operate joints.The purpose study determine whether post-operative continuous femoral nerve block analgesia superior local wound infiltration combine intravenous patient control analgesia improve joint function reduce incidence chronic post-surgical pain ( CPSP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Versus Local-wound Infiltration Analgesia For Patients Receiving Total Knee Arthroplasty -- - A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgical type knee include arthroscopy , total partial knee arthroplastic surgery . These procedure typically associate severe pain . Function training , imperative surgery patient , also aggravate pain.Post-operative pain major knee surgery impair post-operative knee recovery prolong inpatient length stay.To maximize efficacy minimize side effect different option , multi-modal analgesic regimen recommend patient underwent knee surgeries.Local wound infiltration nerve block give considerable attentions.Compared systematic analgesia , nerve block local anesthetic reveal provide superior analgesia well recovery joint function compare systemic analgesic . Currently , systematic evidence sparse relate comparative efficacy pain control local wound infiltration nerve block , investigator therefore conduct randomize controlled trial . This study approve institutional review board First Affiliated Hospital Chongqing Medical University . The protocol design accordance Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement . This study design randomize control trial compare analgesic efficacy continuous femoral nerve block ( group CFNB ) local wound infiltration ( group LWI ) . Participants group CFNB receive single injection femoral nerve block intra-operatively combine continuous femoral nerve block post-operatively guide ultrasound nerve stimulator . Participants group LWI receive peri-articular injection suspension ( 48 ml 0.8 % ropivacaine 2 ml 40mg methylprednisolone ) combine intravenous non-opioid patient control analgesia.All participant receive unify post-operative rehabilitation programme prophylaxis infection thrombo-embolism . The primary outcome study incidence chronic moderate-to-severe post-surgical pain.The secondary outcome study acute post-operative pain rescue medication ; knee function measure WOMAC knee score ; life ability measure EQ-5D questionnaire ; adverse event associate post-operative analgesia . This study conduct supervision independent auditor . Every week , auditor check data participant day survey conduct . Assessment pain intensity prognostic outcome must confirm auditor sample population . When disagreement surgeon anesthesiologist evaluate prognosis patient , auditor must solve disagreement discussion evaluator . Data double-entered two statistician limitation access lock statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
