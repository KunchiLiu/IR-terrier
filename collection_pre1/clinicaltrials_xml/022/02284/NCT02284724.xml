	<brief_title>Dry Needling Multifidus Muscle Subjects With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consenting subject pre-screened contraindication dry needle whether meet criterion low back pain . Following acceptance prior intervention session , subject complete pre-participation questionnaire . This used check needle phobia previous adverse reaction needle prospective subject analyze potential confounding variable within subject participate . Once consent accepted study , subject teach deep corset contraction ( DCC ) , isolate co-contraction bilateral transversus abdominis deep fiber lumbar multifidus . Following DCC training , subject real-time ultrasound transducer apply lateral abdominal wall order image three abdominal muscle layer external oblique , internal oblique transversus abdominis . A relaxed state measure take ultrasound image . Subjects perform DCC second measure abdominal muscle take . A percentage thickness change calculate . Prior treatment , subject randomly assign one 2 intervention order group : 1 ) Dry needling : subject place prone dry needle bilateral multifidus muscle perform . Subjects sense light pressure skin penetrate needle . 2 ) Sham needling : subject place prone plastic tube house needle dry needle press bilateral multifidus muscles.Subjects sense light pressure , skin penetrate . All needling sham needle intervention perform `` clean needle '' condition use appropriate skin preparation use clean protective glove PI . The needle use single-use disposable acupuncture-style needle come plastic tube easy insertion . Dry needle technique technique many practice therapist use various musculoskeletal condition , also teach PI part requirement Doctor Physical Therapy degree . For study , needle sham needle intervention perform PI 27 year experience intervention . Immediately follow needle sham needling , real-time ultrasound reapplied measure thickness abdominal muscle relax state contract state use DCC , percent change calculate . Measurements collect one three independent researcher blind intervention . An average 3 measurement use calculate percent thickness change treatment . In addition , PI perform needle remain blind ultrasound measurement . Subjects contact phone 48 hour well one week intervention give verbally complete questionnaire regard degree pain level disability .</detailed_description>
