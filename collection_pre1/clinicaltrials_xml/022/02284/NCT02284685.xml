There likely one million student whose EDs go untreated give year . Left untreated EDs typically become severe refractory treatment . Given impact EDs mental physical health connection therein social , academic , economic outcome , effective intervention increase rate treatment utilization would broad societal effect extend well beyond campus setting .

	<brief_title>A Novel Intervention Promoting Eating Disorder Treatment Among College Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eating disorder ( EDs ) high rate mortality mental illness . ED age onset coincides undergraduate year ( age 18-25 ) . As , college provide access large , epidemiologically vulnerable population present unique opportunity intervention . On college campus , 14 % female 4 % male student screen positive clinically significant EDs . An estimated 80 % student receive treatment . Left untreated EDs typically become severe refractory treatment . Help-seeking intervention typically focus minimize stigma , improve knowledge , address barrier emphasize classic theory health behavior . On whole , intervention fail increase treatment utilization vast majority student ED symptom . Innovative approach urgently need narrow ED treatment gap college campus . The propose study build comprehensive research date mental health service utilization college population , Principal Investigator study ( PI ) develop faculty advisor . Findings reveal new insight ED treatment gap : student untreated EDs report seek help reason lack time , lack perceive need , ambivalence severity need , belief problem resolve without treatment , desire deal issue `` . '' These reason imply lack urgency necessarily strong resistance receiving treatment . In similar health context ( e.g. , diet/exercise , use preventative care ) , behavioral economic intervention produce positive result address several cognitive bias , include default bias ( individual 'go flow ' preset option ) sign effect ( loss ( negative outcome ) substantially psychologically costly gain ( positive outcome ) ) . The present intervention study address bias effort increase service use among undergraduate student untreated ED symptom ( identify online screen ) . In 12-week study , study team use factorial design test effect three intervention component : peer norming , default option , sign effect . The intervention component deliver via email messaging . To address default bias , email message reframe treatment use opt-out ( opposed opt-in ) behavior , thus nudge student seek help . Students able check box opt receive treatment linkage . Those opt-out receive , without purposeful action , continue assistance connect treatment . For sign effect , message emphasize negative consequence untreated EDs engender urgency . Students condition peer norming see level eat disorder symptom ( result widely-used , validated measure include baseline survey ) compare average symptom level among undergraduate ( data take national survey previously conduct study team ) . Follow-up data collect week 6 12 . Intervention component operationalized electronic message deliver 12-weeks ( anticipated : January-May 2015 ) .</detailed_description>
