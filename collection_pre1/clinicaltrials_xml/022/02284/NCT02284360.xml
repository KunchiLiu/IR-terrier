	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Double-Blinded Placebo Controlled , Explorative Phase I Trial Investigate Safety Tolerability Two Different Doses Topically Administered APOSEC™ Healthy Male Subjects With Artificial Dermal Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>APOSEC™ human product derive lyophilized conditional medium peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) follow 24 hour cultivation irradiation 60Gy . The soluble factor produce factor ( secretome ) regenerative function enhance wound heal due activation signal cascade involve cell migration , proliferation cell survival . The product also possess strong angiogenic property well vivo vitro . APOSEC™ intend topical use , promote heal wound association standard wound care . Standard wound care include initial debridement , avoidance treatment wound related infection non-weight-bearing regime decrease pressure wound . The verum APOSEC™ process lyophilisate resuspend Nugel final formulation . It compare placebo , cell-free parallel produce cell-free control lyophilisate finally formulate Nugel well . 10 eligible healthy volunteer consecutively allocate 2 different dose group APOSEC™ dose escalation scheme . The first 5 subject group A receive low dose APOSEC™ ( 12.5*10^6 lyophilize PBMC/mL ) , subsequent 5 subject group B receive high dose APOSEC™ ( 25*10^6 lyophilize PBMC/mL ) . Each volunteer receive Verum Placebo two artificial wound inner upper non-dominant arm . The location application Verum Placebo ( proximal distal ) subject randomization .</detailed_description>
