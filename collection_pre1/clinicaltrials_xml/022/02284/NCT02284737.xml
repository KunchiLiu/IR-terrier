	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) characterize premature death mainly progressive severe right ventricular failure . Target drug report associated significant improvement clinical outcome PAH patient . However , previous study use target drug focus change 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) hemodynamic response . As 6MWD weak correlation clinical outcome ( time clinical worsening , TTCW ) , benefit target PAH patient clear . We previously report safety efficacy pulmonary artery denervation ( PADN ) treatment PAH unresponsive target drug . However , lack randomize study identify effect PADN PAH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Efficacy PADN Improved Functional Capacity Hemodynamics Patients With PAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study design multicenter , randomize prospective study aim compare effect PADN PAH patient . Based previous study , rate pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) -related event around 29 % 6-month treatment use target drug . And previous data show PAH-related event 6-month PADN procedure 15 % . As result , total 370 PAH patient require , 185 patients/per group ratio 1:1 randomization .</detailed_description>
