	<brief_summary>This Phase II , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , placebo control , multicentre study 52 week treatment duration . The primary objective evaluate efficacy ( endogenous insulin secretion ) , safety tolerability weekly albiglutide ( glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) agonist ) versus placebo add insulin therapy subject new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus ( NOT1DM ) residual insulin production.. Approximately 68 eligible subject randomise 3:1 ratio 51 subject receive albiglutide 30 milligram ( mg ) weekly ( increase 50 mg weekly Week 6 30-mg weekly dose tolerate ) added-on insulin therapy 17 subject receive placebo weekly added-on insulin therapy . The total duration subject 's participation approximately 72 week ( 8 week Screening , 52 week treatment 12 week Post-treatment Follow-up )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female , age 18 30 year , inclusive , diagnosis T1DM interval 2856 day initial diagnosis first dose study drug . Documentation diagnosis T1DM ( insulin deficiency ) , include date diagnosis , must obtain diagnose physician . Currently require insulin T1DM treatment , require insulin therapy T1DM ( &gt; =7 day ) date diagnosis first dose study drug . Note : subject currently take twice daily commercially available premixed insulin eligible . Positive least one follow autoantibody typically associate T1DM : antibody glutamic acid decarboxylase ( antiGAD ) antibody protein tyrosine phosphataselike protein ( antiIA2 ) insulin autoantibody ( IAA ) . Please note : A subject positive IAA negative autoantibody eligible subject use insulin total &gt; =7days . Evidence residual functioning pancreatic betacells measure peak stimulate Cpeptide level &gt; 0.20 nanomoles/litres ( nmol/L ) Screening MMTT plasma glucose level &gt; 3.9 mmol/L ( 70 mg/dL ) &lt; =11.1 mmol/L ( 200 mg/dL ) . Note : Screening MMTT perform within one week resolution DKA event . Body mass index &lt; =32.0 kilogram/square meter ( kg/m^2 ) . Female subject childbearing potential ( i.e. , surgically sterile and/or postmenopausal ) must practice adequate contraception ( i.e. , meet one criterion define ) least 14 day prior first dose randomised study medication 12week posttreatment Followup visit : Abstinence penilevaginal intercourse , female 's preferred usual lifestyle ; Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ; Injectable progestogen ; Implants etonogestrel levonorgestrel ; Estrogenic vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch ; Intrauterine device intrauterine system failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly state product label ; Male partner sterilization prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . The information male sterility come site personnel 's review subject 's medical record ; medical examination subject and/or semen analysis ; interview subject medical history . ; Male condom combine female diaphragm , either without vaginal spermicide Able willing provide write informed consent comply study procedure . Severe gastroparesis i.e. , require therapy within 6 month prior Screening History acute chronic pancreatitis , consider clinically significant risk develop pancreatitis , course study ( e.g . due symptomatic gallstone , excess alcohol use ) . History significant gastrointestinal surgery opinion investigator likely significantly affect upper gastrointestinal pancreatic function ( e.g . gastric bypass banding , antrectomy , RouxenY bypass , gastric vagotomy , small bowel resection , surgery think significantly affect upper gastrointestinal function ) Personal history family history thyroid medullary carcinoma multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ( MEN2 ) History cancer full remission least 3 year Screening . ( A history squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin , treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II allow ) Fasting triglyceride level &gt; 750 milligram/decilitre ( mg/dL ) Screening . Subjects may retested screening , value long meet exclusion criterion , subject randomly assign treatment Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; =30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ( calculate use Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula Haemoglobinopathy may affect proper interpretation HbA1c Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) Unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , oesophageal gastric varix persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . [ Chronic stable hepatitis B C acceptable subject otherwise meet entry criterion active antiviral treatment ( e.g. , presence hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C test result within 3 month screen ) ] Any clinically significant comorbidity abnormality ( include psychiatric disorder , autoimmune endocrinopathy e.g. , primary autoimmune hypothyroidism , hyperadrenalism , coeliac disease etc ) opinion Investigator , may pose additional risk administer study medication trial participation Female subject pregnant ( confirmed laboratory test ) lactate Known allergy GLP1 analogue , insulin , excipients albiglutide Treatment oral antidiabetic medication within prior 30 day 5 half life medication , whichever longer . Use immunosuppressant , intravenous immunoglobulin , oral systemically injected glucocorticoid within 3 month randomisation high likelihood requirement prolong treatment ( &gt; 1 week ) year follow randomisation . However , short course oral steroid ( single dose multiple dose 7 day ) may permit provided case discuss medical monitor . Inhaled , intraarticular , small quantity nonpotent topical corticosteroid allow Receipt investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , Screening , history receipt investigational antidiabetic drug within 3 month randomisation , receipt albiglutide previous study .</criteria>
