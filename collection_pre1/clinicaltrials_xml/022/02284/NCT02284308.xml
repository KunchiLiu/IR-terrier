	<brief_title>Elderly With Locally Advanced Lung Cancer : Deciding Through Geriatric Assessment Optimal Treatment Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer problem elderly : 30 % lung cancer patient age ≥ 75 year . Due underrepresentation elderly patient clinical trial lack evidence select optimal treatment strategy patient . Concurrent radiochemotherapy ( RCHT ) recognise standard treatment stage III NSCLC patient good performance status . Evidence treatment gain clinical trial mostly exclude elderly patient . Furthermore , survival gain obtain combined RCHT , come significant increase toxicity . Therefore , information benefit harm intensify treatment concurrent RCHT among subpopulation medically fit elderly patient still lack . Moreover , reliable tool need distinguish subgroup fit patient frail patient , i.e . expect experience important toxicity .</detailed_description>
