	<brief_title>Effect Hilotherm Therapy Post-operative Pain Swelling Following Surgical Wisdom Tooth Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>How Hilotherm therapy affect post-operative pain swell surgical wisdom tooth removal ? Wisdom tooth removal one common minor oral surgical procedure . The widely experienced post-operative complication include pain swelling , research effect minimise utmost importance improve quality care deliver patient . Our research investigate efficacy Hilotherm therapy , use pre-shaped plastic facial mask water circulates control temperature , reduce experience post-operative pain swelling . The Hilotherm face mask place immediately surgery , patient recovery area wear ONE side face , randomise use computer programme decide time surgery . It wear one hour wisdom tooth removal . We use 3D photography analysis patient face assess extent swelling , assessment pain use visual analogue scale , overall satisfaction Hilotherm therapy . These measurement record : Day 0 - 60 minute post-op patient worn Hilotherm cool mask Day 3 Day 10 Day 24 The person analyse 3D image blind side intervention . All patient undergoing wisdom tooth removal side , similar surgical difficulty , carry General Anaesthetic Daycase Unit One Hospital eligible . Both extraction carry surgeon . Participants undergo complication procedure exclude study . Extractions end dissimilar also exclude , patient unsuitable use Hilotherm mask ( example allergy ) also consider . Any patient immune system affect disease , patient suffer allergic reaction pharmaceutical agent also consider . No element treatment change normal protocol .</detailed_description>
