	<brief_summary>Along edge eyelid , gland ( meibomian gland ) produce deliver oil ( meibum ) onto tear film . These oil serve slow evaporation tear . The meibomian gland may become obstructed due change meibum quality . When meibum thicken solidifies , plug gland opening oil longer reach tear film . The blockage glands primary cause meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) , may result symptom dry eye ( burn , sting , grittiness , etc. ) . The typical treatment MGD procedure call `` warm compress '' . It combination apply heat pressure eyelids approximately 10 minute melt meibum , unplug gland opening , allow oil flow normally onto tear film . One way apply heat eyelid use MGDRx® EyeBag . The EyeBag microwave 30-40 second full power , place closed eye approximately 10 minute . The eye gently massage afterwards . The purpose study determine effective EyeBag improve MGD dry eye symptom .</brief_summary>
