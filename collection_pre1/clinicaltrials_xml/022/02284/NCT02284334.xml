	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct research study nutrition mitochondrial disease . The investigator interested kind carbohydrate people eat . Carbohydrates important source energy . Certain kinds carbohydrate tend raise blood sugar healthy people , others tend raise blood sugar less healthy people . The investigator would like know eat `` right '' type carbohydrate , people mitochondrial disease avoid high lactate level , high blood sugar level , , later , low blood sugar . In study , question answer finding people mitochondrial disease respond two different test meal contain different kind carbohydrate . Neither participant investigator know kind test meal participant eat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study involve two study visit CHOP , around 6 8 hour long . The time visit take depend long take complete study procedure list . This different person person . The length time Visit # 1 Visit # 2 2 week 3 month . Overall study participation exceed 6 month . The study involve follow test procedure . These happen two visit : - Interviews : A team member take participant 's medical history , along list medication s/he take . Throughout study participant ask report s/he think anything bad happen result study . - 3-day diet record : The investigator collect record participant make everything s/he eat 3 day study visit . - Physical Examination : The investigator measure participant 's weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate respiratory rate , waist circumference . If participant age 21 year , pediatric endocrinologist check far s/he along puberty . For boys girl , pubic hair growth check . For girl , breast development check . For boy , testicular development check . This examination take approximately 2 minute do private room . - Pregnancy Test ( female subject ) : If female participant eleven year old old and/or already start period , ask take pregnancy test start study . - Questionnaires : Investigators ask participant fill questionnaires his/her physical function well-being . These design people mitochondrial disease ( parent child mitochondrial disease ) . They take around 20 minute . - Pre-Test Fast : The participant able eat drink anything except plain , unflavored water ( i.e. , `` fast '' ) least 4 hour mixed-meal tolerance test start . S/he get test meal time . S/he receive recommendation visit schedule begin fast . This recommendation design 10 hour fast , participant 's long usual overnight fast , whichever short . - Mixed Meal Tolerance Test ( MMTT ) : The test include placement intravenous ( IV ) line participant 's arm/hand make take blood sample easier . With IV place , participant need stick blood draw , unless IV stop work . If s/he prefers , numb cream place skin 45 minute test numb area . Once IV place , participant receive test `` shake '' . S/he 30 minute finish shake . Over next 4 hour , blood drawn every 30 minute IV line . The total amount blood drawn MMTT little less 2 tablespoon . - Cognitive Testing : Two time MMTT participant ask perform test computer ( example , press button soon see symbol appear ) . Each test take around 14 minute test thing like attention reaction time . We show test work MMTT . - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) Scan : A special x-ray body call DXA scan do measure amount fat lean ( non-fat ) tissue participant 's body . During DXA scan , participant ask lie flat back table scanning machine move participant 's body . The DXA scan like X-ray , take 5-10 minute . This test painless involve needle .</detailed_description>
