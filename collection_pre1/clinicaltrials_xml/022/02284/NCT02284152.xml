	<brief_summary>In present study , test novel approach understand infant bottle-feeding interaction : experimentally manipulate bottle-feeding condition well understand maternal infant influence overfeed , well individual difference risk overfeed . Specifically , observe mother-infant dyad typical , `` mother-led '' feeding , mother give instruction regard much feed infant ( hereafter refer `` typical feeding '' [ TF ] ) , well `` infant-led '' ( IL ) feeding , wherein minimize mother ' influence feeding ensure feed response infant ' hunger fullness cue . Using within-subject , objective , experimental approach , present study aim : 1 ) directly measure extent overfeed occur bottle-feeding 2 ) describe characteristic infant mother overfeed bottle-feeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each mother-infant dyad come laboratory two different day , separated average 2.1 Â± 0.4 day . The two test session occur time day control infant ' circadian rhythmicity . Mothers instruct bring two infant ' typical bottle fill infant ' typical formula test session . Mothers videotape feed infant day . The first day test always Typical Feeding ( TF ) condition instruction give mother : `` Please feed infant normally would home . '' The second day test always Infant-Led ( IL ) condition , wherein use protocol develop establish laboratory control number factor allow evaluation infant ' hedonic behavioral response independent parent experimenter . The feed protocol IL condition entail following step , facilitate experimenter : ( 1 ) feeding session begin experimenter observe infant displaying sign hunger ( e.g. , mouthing , root , fuss ) mother verify infant hungry ; ( 2 ) mother instructed talk infant remain neutral possible ; ( 3 ) mother also instruct feed infant his/her customary pace ; ( 4 ) experimenter end feed infant display sign fullness ( e.g. , turn head and/or body away bottle , bite chew nipple , spit nipple ) least three consecutive occasion . If infant finish bottle signal fullness , experimenter give mother bottle ensure infant intake limit formula availability . During study day , consumption feed session assess weigh bottle feed use top loading balance ( model PM 15 ; Mettler , Greifensee , Switzerland ) .</detailed_description>
