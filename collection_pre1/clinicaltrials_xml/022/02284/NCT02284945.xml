	<brief_summary>Spread cancer spinal column grow problem patient cancer . It cause number problem include pain , instability neurologic problem . If leave untreated , progressive weakness , numbness bladder/bowel disturbance occur . The aim treatment help pain reduce risk neurological problem . This treatment traditionally radiotherapy spine . Surgery always mean large open operation long recovery time significant risk complication . There new technology allow less invasive operation take place stabilise spine . The aim relieve pressure spinal cord addition stabilise spinal cord . These technique call 'minimally invasive ' include surgical technique cement augmentation percutaneous instrumentation . The aim study compare traditional open operation new minimally invasive technique see result reduce complication quicker recovery addition achieve goal surgery .</brief_summary>
