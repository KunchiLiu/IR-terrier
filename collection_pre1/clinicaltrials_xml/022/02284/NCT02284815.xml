	<detailed_description>Introduction Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) characterise progressive loss destruction beta cell . The optimal timing intervention remission beta cell regenerative power still present , treat already diseased child , enough beta cell improve outcome cell survive . Thus , overall aim study prolong remission phase introduce glutenfree diet intervention child T1D addition , investigate role physical activity/fitness . Hypothesis : - Gluten-free diet lead shift balance destruction regenerative capacity well increase insulin sensitivity . - The diet impact gut microbiome composition project function , metabolic , immune inflammatory biomarkers . This first study non-pharmacological intervention child combine factor potential effect immune system well insulin sensitivity first include dietary factor , measure physical fitness measure inflammation . Perspectives : If glutenfree prolong remission research area could interest change microRNA follow diet change , influence diet fat carbohydrate metabolism child , diet habit child diabetes , make healthy choice research influence glucose transporter ( GLUT4 ) child insulin sensitivity . Finally , patient benefit prolonged remission decrease burden disease few severe hypoglycemic event , few long-term complication lead substantial reduction cost society . Background : T1D chronic disease high morbidity mortality preserve beta-cells less hypoglycemic event le progression late complication ( 1 ) , therefore preservation expansion beta-cells goal . Intervention study type 1 patient primarily focus immune suppress immune modulation ( 2 ) . Most study several serious side effect effect preserve expand number beta cell . Why gluten key factor ? Animal model proven hydrolyze diet gluten-free diet reduces incidence diabetes substantially ( 3-5 ) . Gluten consist glutenin gliadin . Incomplete degradation gluten irritate intestinal mucosa , result unspecific subclinical inflammation . Compared conventional food , gluten-free diet increase number regulatory T cell Peyer 's patch gut ( 6 ) . Gluten also know affect composition intestinal microflora ( 7 ) . A gluten-rich diet show modify balance pro anti-inflammatory cytokine T cell ( 8 ) Rats gut dysfunction increase gut-permeability , find pre-T1D human ( 9 ) , probable mechanism gliadin increase gut hormone zonulin , increase gut permeability ( 10 ) . Enterovirus also increase gut permeability ( 11 ) . The consequence increase uptake bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharides , incompletely degrade gliadin pass gut barrier . Gliadin find maternal breast milk healthy mother . The gliadin must transport blood , mean organ relatively high blood flow , islet Langerhans , could also expose gliadin may actually accumulate gliadin . Gluten affect micro flora gut ( 12 ) . It demonstrate human microbiota transplant germ-free mouse transfer host phenotype ( 'personalized gnotobiotics ' ) . Human study indicate introduction wheat diet age four month increase risk beta-cell auto-immunity four time ( 13 ; 14 ) .Two human intervention study individual high risk develop diabetes treat gluten-free diet six 12 month show impact diabetes auto-immunity ( 15 ) diabetes incidence ( 16 ) , show increased insulin sensitivity period gluten-free diet . The intervention may short affect autoimmunity . Rationale focus composition diet physical fitness addition gluten During remission phase insulin reduce need 2 units/kg less 0.2 units/kg within days/weeks onset insulin treatment prove influence glucotoxicity beta cell . The dietary requirement fewer carbohydrate low glycaemic index relax introduction faster-acting type insulin pump treatment . But several study show intensive treatment contribute preserve beta cell ( 17,18 ) , perhaps beta cell quiescent high degree , rather active , active beta cell sensitive toxic stimulus ( 19 ) . In addition , composition diet important glycaemic control ( 20 ) potentially affect immune system indirectly affect intestinal microflora ( 21 ) . The quantity quality carbohydrate also important insulin requirement . Physical activity sedentary lifestyle know associated insulin resistance ( IR ) . The association sedentary lifestyle IR measure fast state partly explain adipositas , whereas association IR insulin secretion base Oral Glucose Tolerance Test independent adipositas ( 22 ) . Studies also show high insulin sensitivity patient physical active meal ( 23 ) increase fitness associate increase level glucose transporter ( GLUT4 ) thereby exploit insulin ( 24 ) . Our research group involve study immune system , risk factor T1D remission phase several year . We already proven family interested change diet chance prolong remission . Methods material Design : A prospective study include newly diagnose child type 1 diabetes instruct supervised trained dietician eat gluten-free- low-glycaemic diet within 2 month diagnosis follow dedicated team medical doctor , nurse dietician entry protocol 6 12 month diagnosis . The diet : Families instruct dietician either - eat gluten-free - normal guideline concern carbohydrate diabetic child The diet estimate base validate food frequency questionnaire - fill online study entry 6 , 12 month . Primary outcome : Insulin adjust HbA1c ( IDAA1c ) ( 25 ) ; Stimulated C-peptide ; Insulin dose per kg Secondary outcome : The alteration gut microbiome composition function metabolic , immune inflammatory biomarkers . Boost- test ( meal-stimulation test ) The meal test do 8 hour fast morning . Boost ( Med . Johnson , Evansville , Indiana , USA ; 237 ml = 8 ounce ( OZ ) ; 33 g carbohydrate , 15 g protein 6 g fat , 240 kcal ) : 6 ml/kg ( max . : 360 ml ) . Blood sample blood glucose take 0 minute 90 minute intake Boost . The Boost-test perform inclusion plus 6 12 month post diagnosis . Fear hypoglycemia Quality life : We use validated questionnaire fear hypoglycemia quality life . Gut microbiota : Three stool sample take follow standard operation procedure ( SOP ) ) indicate time point ( inclusion 6 month ) . Stool sample send quantitative metagenomics analysis microbial DNA Novo Nordisk Foundation Center Basic Metabolic Research , Copenhagen University . Inflammation : The level master transcription factor responsible shift Cluster Differentiation ( CD ) 4+ T cell different phenotype : T-bet Th1 cell , Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor GATA-3 Th2 , Foxp3 T-regs , RORγt ( retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma ) Th17 , DX5 marker Natural Killer cell . Isolated lymphocytes save resuspend 500 µL Trizol ( Invitrogen ) reagent RNA extraction store -80 ˚C use . The Bartholin Institute , Rigshospitalet responsible study diet induce proportional change mention T cell population . Statistics power calculation Statistics : Multiple linear regression use find measure insulin sensitivity test factor associate c-peptide decline IdaA1c . Relevant confounders age , c-peptide onset , diabetes duration gender adjust model . Power : We need 100 individual , 50 % complete glutenfree diet , find different IdaA1c 1 power 80 % significance 0.05 . The mean previous cohort 10,7 12 month Standard Deviation = 2,0 . 27 . To find difference c-peptide need 128 individual group 80 % power significance level 0.05 . If use previous cohort control need 58 patient intervention group . Feasibility Paediatric Department Herlev Hospital least 60 new child T1D year , approximately 50 % agree participate pilot study glutenfree diet . We access two cohort 270 129 child respectively follow least 12 month boost test 1,6 12 month . Paediatric Department large center childhood diabetes Denmark , previously responsible follow-up study newly diagnose child remission describe gene biomarkers ( Zink autoantibody , Interleukin-1ra , adiponectin , glucagon ) associate remission . Furthermore investigated cytokine immuno globulin associate risk T1D . We also find increase chemokines unchanged vitamin D newly diagnose child . Collaborators : Henrik B. Mortensen , professor research leader Paediatric Department , work remission phase decade publish numerous study subject . Professor Karsten Buschard , Rigshospitalet , postdoc Julie Antvorskov animal model study different T-cell population well cytokine pattern T-cells regulatory T-cells , capacity test human cell well . Professor Oluf Borbye-Pedersen , University Copenhagen , experience leading study gut microbiota involve numerous project concern gut microbiota . Ethical aspects The study concern intervention glutenfree diet approve regional scientific ethical committee , project include stool sample approve January 2013 .</detailed_description>
