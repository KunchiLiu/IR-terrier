	<brief_summary>This study collaboration NYP-Columbia NYP-Cornell seek evaluate use topical vancomycin reduction surgical site infection ( SSI ) neurosurgical procedure . Adult patient undergo neurosurgery either institution eligible participation randomize control trial . Patients randomized treatment group receive 2g vancomycin apply powder paste wound site and/or bone flap . Subjects control group receive current standard care without topical vancomycin . All subject undergo swab anterior naris surgical site prior surgery , 10-14 day follow operation 90 day follow operation . The primary outcome measure surgical site infection , assess daily throughout hospital stay , first follow-up visit , telephone 30 day . Secondary outcome include length hospital stay , length intensive care stay , rate reoperation patient mortality . In addition , systemic vancomycin level assess 6 hour 24 hour postoperatively patient . Patients external ventricular drain place vancomycin level assess daily . In patient cranial drain place , vancomycin concentration analyze daily wound drainage . Skin nasal flora analyze assess impact topical vancomycin patient microbiome . Although decrease incidence infection follow craniotomy secondary prophylactic intravenous antibiotic , proper sterile technique , intervention , SSIs continue significantly impact morbidity , mortality , cost burden . Although never study neurosurgical procedure instrument spine , application topical vancomycin surgical site prior wound closure demonstrate reduction SSIs spine , cardiac ophthalmologic procedure . The benefit use prophylactic vancomycin topically , oppose intravenously , include reduce systemic level drug , therefore , decrease probability adverse event related drug , induce resistance among native flora . The investigator propose randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness topical vancomycin reduce SSIs rate follow neurosurgical procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical-site infection ( SSIs ) occur 500,000 patient per year United States . Patients SSIs require significantly long hospital stay high healthcare expenditure . In fact , estimate SSIs responsible almost 4 million excess hospital day billion dollar add hospital charge every year . Additionally , SSIs significant source morbidity mortality surgical patient ( 5,8 ) . Thus , prompt definitive measure necessary order redress significant public health concern . Over past decade , implementation number preventative measures—including improve technique preoperative skin antisepsis antibiotic prophylaxis —have lead significant reduction rate SSIs . Studies demonstrate approximately half SSIs preventable proper use prophylactic antibiotic . Despite dramatic improvement , SSIs remain tremendous burden healthcare system . Furthermore , routine use systemic antibiotic prophylaxis without risk , may lead rapid development antibiotic resistance , also expose patient undesirable systemic drug effect . The purpose study evaluate ability topical vancomycin reduce surgical site infection neurosurgical operation .</detailed_description>
