	<brief_title>Blood Sample Monitoring Patients With EGFR Mutated Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Non-small celled lung cancer ( NSCLC ) one common cancer world , Denmark one high incidence approximately 3800 new patient year diagnose NSCLC , overall prognosis poor . The EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) system 4 receptor ( EGFR , HER2 , HER3 HER4 ) relate protein know play active role development cancer . In non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) especially EGFR study . Inhibition EGFR associate prolonged survival especially patient mutation EGFR ( EGFR M+ ) 10-15 % patient NSCLC harbor mutation tumor 's EGFR . This receptor target treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) erlotinib . The response rate erlotinib treatment EGFR M+ NSCLC around 75 % opposed response rate around 30 % treatment traditional chemotherapy . Recently , resistance mechanism cause progression TKI treatment elucidate . The common T790M mutation EGFR , mechanism increase MET HER3 expression also describe . It estimate T790M mutation EGFR account 50 % case TKI resistance development . With exception HER3 MET , estimate represent le 5 % case development resistance , mutation cause remain 50 % case , resistance remain unknown . The revelation resistance mutation hamper problem obtain biopsy progression occur . Identification EGFR M+ do tumor biopsy , difficult retrieve . Furthermore biopsy provide information certain part one tumor site , test . The investigator know tumor especially NSCLC heterogenous group . A blood test provide u e overall information tumor mass specific patient . However tumor DNA also present blood cancer patient form circulate free DNA . A new blood base test identifies EGFR M+ plasma , make possible monitor level EGFR M+ patient 's blood treatment . This enable closer monitoring treatment erlotinib close study resistance mechanism almost inevitably develop treatment . A pilot study 23 EGFR M+ NSCLC patient demonstrate quantity EGFR M+ plasma correlate response treatment might use predict disease progression . In study resistance mutation detect 20-300 day prior clinical evidence disease progression via CT scan . Retrospective study suggest local treatment oligoprogressive disease markedly increase progression free survival thus prolonging time change subsequent line systemic treatment necessary . Methods Patients disseminate EGFR M+ NSCLC refer one participate oncology department may offer enrollment project . A multicenter collaboration allow u identify 200 EGFR M+ patient two-year period . The EGFR mutation must diagnose via diagnostic tissue sample . Patients must 18 year give write consent enter study . Patients time withdraw consent . The patient receive standard treatment follow . Standard 1st line treatment patient disseminate EGFR M+ disease erlotinib . Standard follow treatment blood test clinical evaluation every 6th week CT scan evaluate RECIST criterion every 12th week . Additional test order clinical indication . A biopsy blood sample retrieve treatment initiate . The patient monitor prospectively blood sample ( 2x10 ml EDTA tube ) every 3rd-6th week erlotinib treatment , subsequent line treatment treatment intermission . The blood sample transport Department Clinical Biochemistry , Aarhus University Hospital analyze subtypes EGFR M+ sensitize mutation mutation know drive resistance erlotinib treatment . Analyses perform use COBAS 4800 light cycler . In event occur resistance mutation unexpected increase quantity sensitize mutation clinical action take ; initially form additional scan search sign disease progression . Clinical data retrieve patient 's medical journal . These data include TNM status , histology , treatment modality patient characteristic ( gender , age , smoke status performance status ) Patients follow death least 24 month inclusion . Tissue sample examine retrospectively use exom sequencing . Any excess biological material patient ' consent store 15 year bio bank -80 degree celsius . This allow optimal use material , make possible conduct future research cancer field . Aims perspectives The overall purpose study increase knowledge concern molecular mechanism - especially development resistance - EGFR M+ NSCLC . Increased molecular knowledge crucial development towards personalize cancer care . It provide u good method select treatment optimal choice individual patient . The investigator expect result validate use EGFR M+ detection quantification via blood sample clinically relevant set complement CT scan treatment evaluation . The investigator expect able identify disease progression earlier would possible use CT scan alone thereby discover case oligoprogressive disease eligible local treatment thus - hopefully - increase progression free survival . The continuation blood monitoring subsequent line treatment treatment intermission add knowledge nature EGFR M+ NSCLC . Additionally sample biological material make possible u investigate biology resistance .</detailed_description>
