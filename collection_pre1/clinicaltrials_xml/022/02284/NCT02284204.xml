	<brief_summary>There still extensive debate best method control behavior preschool child dental treatment . Protective stabilization , moderate sedation general anesthesia advance behavior control technique indicate dental treatment early childhood caries offer advantage disadvantage procedure immediately . Many child early childhood caries require invasive dental treatment . According final report large epidemiological survey oral condition Brazilians , five-year-old child average 2.43 primary teeth caries fewer 20 % treated 2010 . This disease also remain public health problem develop country ; 19.5 % 2-5-year-old American child untreated cavity . There , however , lack ideal sedative . Such drug must , one hand , control behavior integral form , provide amnesia , minimize physical discomfort , distress pain , , , safeguard security , minimal effect cardio-respiratory function , minimize occurrence adverse event , well allow return patient State allows high safely . The investigator thus perform prospective study aim ass occurrence adverse event dental treatment first 24 hour sedation midazolam , ketamine sevoflurane child age four six year . Our hypothesis difference adverse event among different association drug could find .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sevoflurane Associated With Oral Midazolam Ketamine Dental Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty one child age 46-81 month ( mean 62.8 month ) complete randomized clinical trial followed-up adverse event total 37 child ( 27 exclude outside age range survey , present negative behavior prior dental treatment ) . These child classify ASA PS 1 2 , refer Dental Sedation Study Center ( NESO ) Federal University Goiás School Dentistry public health service . In clinical trial , randomize control type triple-blind , two group child receive specific intervention : ) MC group : compose child undergo sedation association midazolam ketamine per oral , placebo ( oxygen ) inhalation ; b ) MCS : group compose child undergo sedation association midazolam ketamine per oral , inhaled sevoflurane . Inclusion criterion : 1 ) age four six year ( end dental procedure ) ; 2 ) child ASA I II ; 3 ) need restorative procedure least deciduous tooth ; 4 ) patent airway nasal effective breathe 5 ) inadequate behavior previous dental treatment . Exclusion criteria 1 ) previous experience dental treatment sedation 2 ) complete seven year data collection . Sample size calculate base primary study 18 child , include final sample . In , two-tailed hypothesis test , find occurrence adverse event first 24 hour sedation dental treatment present proportion 87.5 % MC Group proportion 30 % MCS Group , define , achieve probability 80 % study detect difference level significance 5 % , would need sample 10 participant group ( n = 20 ) . On day treatment , upon arrive clinic , check healthiness child NPO protocol , child accompany parent/guardian redirect drug delivery room , anesthesiologist pediatrician prepared medication disposable syringe administer drug : midazolam-Dormire ® ( Cristália , São Paulo , Brazil ) , dose 0.5 mg/kg ( maximum dose 20 mg ) ketamine-Ketamin ® ( Cristália , São Paulo , Brazil ) , dose 3 mg/kg ( maximum 50 mg ) . After 15 minute , redirect dental office vital sign monitor ( Infinity ® Vista XL ( Drägerwerk AG &amp; co. , Lubeck , Germany ) . According randomization , child receive oxygen mixture oxygen sevoflurane-Sevocris ® ( Cristália , São Paulo , Brazil ) , provide anesthesia workstation ( Fabius ® Plus - Drägerwerk AG &amp; co. , Lubeck , Germany ) . Such gas provide mask place nose child ( Dynomite ® Nasal Hood - Matrx-Parker Instrument , Hatfield , USA ) analyse use anesthetic gas analyser ( Let 's ® -Drägerwerk AG &amp; co. , Lubeck , Germany ) . Initially , child receive 100 % oxygen flow rate 5 l/min , 5 minute . After period , child randomize MCS Group , sevoflurane add initial concentration 0.1 % , 0.1 % increment every 30 second , final expire concentration 0.3 0.4 % . In case child randomized MC Group ( without sevoflurane ) , anesthesiologist simulate supply sevoflurane , child receive 100 % oxygen . After 15 minute place nasal mask supply gas , pediatric dentist dental treatment begin plan . At end procedure , post-operative recommendation ( write protocol ) give parents/guardians . On day follow treatment , telephone contact make parents/guardians gather information possible adverse event 24 hour follow procedure . In group , session , child 's behavior evaluate Houpt scale , observer previously calibrate mask . The scoring system suggest Houpt et al . purpose include four scale : sleep scale ( awake - score 1 ; asleep - score 2 ) , cry scale ( hysterical cry demand attention - score 1 ; continuous , persistant cry make treatment difficult - score 2 ; intermittent , mild cry interfere treatment - score 3 ; cry - score 4 ) , movement scale ( violent movement , interrupt treatment - score 1 ; continuous movement make treatment difficult - score 2 ; controllable movement interferes treatment - score 3 ; movement - score 4 ) overall behavior scale ( aborted , treatment render - score 1 ; poor , treatment interrupt , partial treatment complete - score 2 ; fair , treatment interrupt , eventually complete - score 3 ; good , difficult treatment perform - score 4 ; good , limited cry movement - score 5 ; excellent , cry movement - score 6 ) . The evaluation perform treatment session . The score establish accordance Houpt Scale every minute session , three specific moment dental treatment ( time anesthesia , time use high rotation end treatment ) , addition overall evaluation . For calibration , examiner watch five minute videos three patient clinical examination . The video watch researcher gold standard , order ass correlation examiner . There concurrence intra inter examiner , obtain value kappa 0.9 0.8 , respectively . After child consider eligible participate survey legal guardian agree participation , assigned random group . The randomization plan child group prepare website Randomization.com ( http : //www.randomization.com ) . The data analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS Windows , version 19.0 SPSS Inc. Chicago , IL , USA ) , follow variable : ) dependent ( occurrence adverse event 24 hour follow procedure ; occurrence intraoperative adverse event ; child 's Behavior ) b ) independent ( gender ; age ; weight ; dose oral sedative ; need physical restraint ; duration session ; recovery time ; heart rate ; oxygen saturation ) . According distribution data obtain analysis Mann-Whitney test , Pearson 's Chi-square Fisher test use . The choice non-parametric test due characteristic data study , present normal distribution . Adopted significance level statistical test apply value 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
