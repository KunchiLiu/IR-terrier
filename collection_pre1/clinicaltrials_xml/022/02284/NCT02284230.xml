	<brief_summary>The present study examine effect liraglutide treatment 26 week several cardiovascular risk factor patient prediabetes end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . The primary objective determine efficacy treatment glucose tolerance evaluate 3h 75g-oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Secondary objective include various clinical biochemical cardiovascular safety parameter . We hypothesise treatment liraglutide improve glucose tolerance prediabetic patient ESRD normalize plasma glucose excursion OGTT ameliorate cardiovascular risk factor .</brief_summary>
