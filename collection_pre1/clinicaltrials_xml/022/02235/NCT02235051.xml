	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis regular exercise increase DNA repair capacity . II . To test hypothesis regular exercise reduces inflammatory response . III . To test hypothesis regular exercise modulates telomerase activity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess adherence study protocol . II . To examine difference body composition exercise intervention . III . To examine difference fitness exercise intervention . IV . To test hypothesis regular exercise increase quality life breast cancer survivor . V. To examine safety exercise intervention . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients participate supervise Curves exercise program three day week 16 week . The circuit-style workout consist 14 exercise construct pneumatic hydraulic resistance target oppose muscle group concentric-only fashion . Each session Curves facility include two complete circuit correspond exercise approximately 30 minute follow standardized stretching routine . ARM II : Patients participate formal exercise program 16 week . Patients offer Curves exercise intervention .</detailed_description>
