	<brief_summary>Despite well-known health benefit physical exercise prevention chronic disease , less attention focus use physical exercise essential part good treatment chronic disease . The aim study investigate feasibility , medical effect , cost-effectiveness , social perspective individualize exercise-based rehabilitation [ 2 different high-intensity training ( HIT ) protocol combine usual care ( UC ) ] acute coronary artery disease ( CAD ) event . The medical aim study mediate mechanism physiological , biochemical molecular effect exercise train clinical outcome . The aim health-economic evaluation ass change Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) health care relate cost estimate cost-effectiveness HIT-based exercise rehabilitation . The purpose sociological analysis find social process make possible emergence desire welfare effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-intensity Exercise After Acute Cardiac Event ( HITCARE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population consist patient live city Kuopio Siilinjarvi area Eastern Finland , treat Kuopio University Hospital acute CAD event . After baseline measurement , patient randomize one 3 group : short interval HIT protocol ( HIT-S ) , long interval HIT protocol ( HIT-L ) UC group . The intervention 12 month per patient expect duration whole study ( intervention data collection ) estimate 4 year . In addition , group annual follow-up examination schedule 60 month initiation intervention phase . The patient recruit study 750 , total 250 patient per study group . All measurement relate intervention perform Kuopio Research Institute Exercise Medicine . Examinations concern myocardial structure perfusion do Turku PET Center ( subsample ) . The study complies Helsinki declaration , follow good clinical practice . Patient safety follow normal medical practice . The intervention anticipate cause health risk apart conventional treatment . All participant provide diverse individualized information health physical performance . The research method employ study safe . Physician nurse present occasion physically strenuous measurement perform careful provision appropriate first aid make . The measurement assess cardiorespiratory muscular fitness involve hard effort unusual feel innocent muscle pain day measurement demand maximal effort . The potential acute complication may include accident ( e.g . injury due slip fall ) medical emergency like acute myocardial infarction . Study hypotheses : 1 . Short ( 15 sec ) long interval ( 3 min ) high-intensity aerobic interval training ( HIT ) combine resistance training acute CAD event equally effective improve cardiorespiratory fitness compare UC . 2 . Despite high unit cost , difference health-related quality life effect large HIT intervention cost-effective compare UC . 3 . Patient 's experience interpretation HIT exercise well different social process rehabilitation explain cost-effectiveness rehabilitation . 4 . Patient group benefit HIT intervention identify predict .</detailed_description>
