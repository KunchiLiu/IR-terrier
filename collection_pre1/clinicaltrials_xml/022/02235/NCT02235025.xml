	<brief_summary>The current definition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) base presence persistent airflow obstruction assess spirometry . About half subject mild COPD ( i.e . reduce forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio along normal FEV1 ] asymptomatic . Subjects symptomatic mild COPD reduce exercise tolerance abnormal dynamic ventilatory mechanic compare healthy subject . The physiological perceptual response exercise subject asymptomatic mild COPD currently unknown . The purpose study ass exercise tolerance , ventilatory constraint tidal volume expansion dyspnoea asymptomatic mild COPD subject undergoing incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) limit tolerance compare symptomatic mild COPD healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asymptomatic Versus Symptomatic Mild COPD : Comparisons Rest Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects attend one single visit . If need , COPD subject ask stop respiratory related medication short long act bronchodilator 72 hour prior visit . Subjects ask arrive early morning . After informed consent appropriate screen medical history , subject complete mMRC scale . A complete medical history collect . Subjects thereafter complete pulmonary function test pre- 30-min post-bronchodilator . Subjects give normal mixed meal ask drink alcohol coffee . A symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test perform day , least 6 hour bronchodilator test least 4 hour meal . After steady-state resting period , 3-min warm-up conduct 20 % individually estimate maximal work load ( Wmax ) , load increase every minute way test duration &gt; 8 &lt; 12 min . The following data obtain breath breath express 30-s average : V'O2 carbon dioxide production ( V'CO2 ) ; minute ventilation ( V ' E ) ; tidal volume ( VT ) ; respiratory rate ; ventilatory equivalent oxygen carbon dioxide . Blood pressure measure every minute sphygmomanometer . Blood sample withdraw arterialize earlobe rest near-maximal exercise . Tests terminate point symptom limitation ( peak exercise ) . Upon exercise cessation , subject ask verbalize main reason stop exercise ( breathe discomfort , leg discomfort ) .</detailed_description>
