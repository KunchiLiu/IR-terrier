	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether super-selective intra-arterial administration verapamil immediately follow successful intra-arterial thrombolysis safe potential neuroprotective agent . Standard procedures cerebral angiography intra-arterial thrombolysis ( intra-arterial administration tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy ) . Experimental procedure superselective injection verapamil intra-arterially .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superselective Administration VErapamil During Recanalization Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial represent first time verapamil evaluate human subject superselectively administer neuroprotective agent administer acute time frame adjunct intra-arterial thrombolysis . The method administration , along routinized followup , provide paradigm study potential neuroprotective agent . Subjects undergo cerebral angiography intra-arterial thrombolysis , standard care . 'Intra-arterial thrombolysis include possible intra-arterial administration tPA , well possible mechanical thrombectomy accept thrombectomy device . This include Merc√≠ Retriever ( Concentric Medical , Mountain View , CA ) , Penumbra System ( Penumbra , Alameda , CA ) , Solitaire stent-triever ( EV3 , Covidien , Irvine , CA ) , Trevo stent-triever ( Concentric Medical , Mountain View , CA ) . Immediately intra-arterial thrombolysis component angiographic procedure complete , microcatheter used procedure leave guided vessel location clot . 10mg verapamil 20cc normal saline administer 20 minute ( 1cc/minute ) microcatheter vessel previously obstruct clot . At conclusion infusion , microcatheter remove . Angiography guide catheter cerebral circulation question perform ensure new thromboembolic event microcatheterization ( standard care ) . The catheter remove , arterial puncture site close standard fashion . Patients receive noncontrast CT scan MRI approximately 24 hour intervention determine presence absence intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) intervention . This would consider standard practice intra-arterial thrombolysis . Both image study detect ICH , choice one determine clinical criterion ; CT MRI may preferable different reason depend upon patient 's clinical scenario . The determination hemorrhage make official dictation diagnostic neuroradiologist directly involve study . The hemorrhage consider adverse event deem symptomatic accordance criterion use International Management Stroke ( IMS ) III study . Briefly , hemorrhage define symptomatic occur within 24+/-6 hour study inclusion , temporally relate intervention , occur worsen neurological status document clinical exam . A 4 point increase NIHSS stroke scale would qualify significant worsening status . Furthermore , hemorrhage require intervention surgically endovascularly would deem significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 2185 year old , male female 2 . Suspected acute ischemic stroke base clinical radiographic evidence determine documented Stroke Neurology team University Kentucky . 3 . Patients must meet criterion intraarterial thrombolysis determine documented Interventional Neuroradiology attend physician ( JF AA ) . 4 . Patients must acute thromboembolus within intracranial artery ( internal carotid , anterior cerebral , middle cerebral , posterior cerebral , basilar , vertebral ) undergo pharmacologic ( tissue plasminogen activator tPA ) and/or mechanical ( eg . Merci Penumbra clot retrieval ) thrombolysis . 5 . Patients impaired capacity may include , pathology study ( stroke ) may impair capacity ( please see attach required documentation regard impaired capacity ) . 6 . Patients must TICI 2A good revascularization via intraarterial thrombolysis . For reference , TICI Scale define : 0 = No Perfusion 1 . = Perfusion past initial obstruction limit distal branch fill little slow distal perfusion 2 . A = Perfusion le 50 % vascular distribution occlude artery 2B = Perfusion 50 % great ( complete ) vascular distribution occlude artery 3 = Full perfusion fill distal branch 1 . Pregnant woman ( would qualify intraarterial thrombolysis standard care ) . 2 . Patients undergo intraarterial thrombolysis acute stroke , TICI 0 1 revascularization obtain . 3 . Patients occlusion cervical common internal carotid artery exclude study .</criteria>
