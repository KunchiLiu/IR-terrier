	<detailed_description>The challenge maintain long-term weight loss well know , however new research suggest diet quality may drive factor . A pilot study group demonstrate high carbohydrate-containing diet associate low total energy expenditure weight loss maintenance ( Ebbeling et al ) . These finding confirm ongoing Framingham State Food Study ( NCT02068885 ) : Following weight loss standard diet , 150 overweight obese adult ( age 18 65 year ) randomize one three weight-loss maintenance diet vary carbohydrate fat ratio 20 week . However , specific mechanism underlie calorie-independent effect diet remain unclear . Another study group demonstrate low energy availability ( calculate base caloric content circulate metabolic fuel concentration ) fast late post-prandial period 8 overweight obese young adult maintain low-fat ( high-carbohydrate ) diet ( Walsh et al ) . We hypothesize low metabolic fuel availability high carbohydrate diet result part increase anabolic change within adipocyte , favor fat storage preference oxidation . We invite subject already enrol Framingham State Food Study participate , aim total 30 subject ( goal approximately equal number per diet group follow randomization assign test diet parent study ) . Participants admit research unit 24-hour period weight maintenance test diet , undergo frequent blood sample measurement circulate metabolic fuel , hunger satiety rating , consume assign diet meal . Each participant also undergo two abdominal subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy local anesthesia , first immediately follow weight loss ( initiate test diet ) second weight maintenance , order perform gene expression analysis adipose tissue . Our main outcome comparison energy availability ( sum energy major metabolic fuel blood ) diet group late postprandial period change adipose tissue gene expression within-individuals diet group assignment . Other outcome include difference hunger satiety rating , total 24-hour energy availability , specific metabolic fuel concentration .</detailed_description>
