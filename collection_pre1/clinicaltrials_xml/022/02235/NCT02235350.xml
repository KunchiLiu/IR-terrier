	<detailed_description>1 . Study Rationale : Epidemiological study report 85 % stroke survivor show hemiparesis percentage range 55 % 75 % report upper limb functional impairment . Early rehabilitation stroke patient motor disorder effective restore affect function improve performance daily activity . Up , different method technique use recover motor function stroke patient , include motor training ( active passive mobilization ) paretic limb , functional electrical stimulation , Constraint Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) robot-assisted rehabilitation . However , none conclusively proven effective others . The clinical benefit induce motor rehabilitation closely related `` neuroplasticity '' , i.e . ability central nervous system ( CNS ) undergo structural functional change response physiological event , environmental stimuli pathological event . After brain injury , neurorehabilitation aim recover function vicariate . In context , observation imitation action recruit mirror neuron system . Mirror neuron find premotor cortex parietal lobe , discharge execution goal-directed action observation similar action perform another individual . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) study show individual observes hand action desynchronization motor cortex similar , although weak , occur actual execution observe movement . By mean Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) show motor-evoked potential record hand muscle increase observation hand movement . Brain imaging study show observation action perform different biological effector ( hand/mouth/foot ) , activation ventral premotor cortex include Broca 's region somatotopically organize . Thus , motor system may activate action observation absence overt movement . Based experimental evidence suggest action observation may exploit rehabilitative approach even patient ca n't perform motor output . Action observation treatment proven effective also rehabilitation Parkinson 's disease patient , child cerebral palsy , orthopedic patient hip/knee replacement . 2 . Aim Study : The main aim present study ass efficacy action observation treatment rehabilitation upper limb motor function acute stroke patient chronic stroke patient apraxia . The study also aim assess neuroplasticity within area belong MNS functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) . 3 . Study design : monocentric , randomize , control trial 2 parallel arm : Action Observation Treatment ( AOT ) Observation video motor content ( Motorial Neutral Observation ( MNO ) . By describe study , follow guideline suggest CONSORT 2010 Statement 4 . Clinical functional evaluation : assessment do neurologist physiotherapist involved rehabilitation program blind respect patient ' group assignment . The Fugl-Meyer , use motor assessment upper extremity ( FMA , range 0-66 ) Functional Independence Measure ( FIM , range 18 - 126 ) use global functional evaluation . In order investigate neurophysiological change Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS , range 0-5 ) measure spasticity shoulder abductor , elbow , wrist , finger thumb flexor administer . Also Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS , range 0 - 10 ) pain assessment use . At end treatment , subject provide score satisfaction therapy ( 1=poor ; 2=sufficient ; 3=good ; 4=excellent ) . All patient assess cognitive point view Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) . To check presence apraxia , scale De Renzi Goldenberg ideational ideomotor apraxia apply . In order rule aphasia , Token Test test free association word use use . Working memory evaluate mean verbal visuospatial span . Depression mood investigate patient Beck Depression Inventory . This evaluation test apply acute stroke inpatient chronic stroke outpatient refer Stroke Unit Scientific Institute Research Treatment ( IRCCS ) Neuromed . 5 . Study Population recruitment : A total 80 patient , include acute stroke patient chronic stroke patient apraxia , refer Stroke Unit clinical center recruit . The research staff charge recruitment pre-screen participant basis inclusion/exclusion criterion explain study time . If subject eligible study accord inclusion/exclusion criterion , she/he include trial randomise , use computer-based random-number generator , receive daily AOT MNO . Before inclusion patient control asked sign inform consent . During AOT MNO , patient undergo conventional rehabilitation treatment , follow activity : passive mobilization paretic side , muscle recruitment paretic side , induction postural reaction . 6 . Statistical analysis : entering analysis , score obtain Fugl Meyer FIM functional scale enter Levene 's test ass homogeneity variance two group . Following , mixed-design analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , time ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ) within-participant factor group ( case , control ) between-participants factor , carry score . To identify source significant difference among mean , post-hoc analysis perform use Newman Keuls test . The significance level post-hoc comparison set 0.05 . To test efficacy treatment , functional score gain ( D : score T3 minus score T2 ) calculate group plan t-test independent sample perform . 7 . Experimental protocol Functional Magnetic Resonance ( fMRI ) : experimental paradigm similar use Binkofski et al. , 1999 use assess activation sensorimotor circuit relate grasping/manipulation action AOT end AOT treatment , aim study re-organization within circuit assess recruitment alternative areas/circuits follow treatment . Subjects lay supine scanner head immobilize pneumatic cushion eye open . The room dark . The subject ask manipulate continuously either five complex object sphere . Each object place participant 's hand begin activation phase remove end one experimenter . As control , participant ask manipulate sphere . Manipulation action include movement finger . Both hand test , separately . The test order randomize across subject . A block design paradigm use block last 20 s. Neuroradiological image analyze MATLAB ( Mathworks Inc. , Natiek , MA , USA ) statistical parametric mapping package SPM96 ( Friston et al. , 1994a , b ; 1995b , 1997 ; Poline et al. , 1995 ; Worsley &amp; Friston , 1995 ) .</detailed_description>
