	<brief_title>Exhaled Breath Condensate Biomarkers Inflammation Individuals With Chronic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The predominant mechanism pulmonary dysfunction individual chronic tetraplegia respiratory muscle paralysis . This lead inadequate ventilation inability clear secretion place patient great risk development respiratory complication . Furthermore , individual chronic tetraplegia exhibit baseline increase airway tone ( bronchoconstriction ) , restoration normal airway caliber follow bronchodilator administration , non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) follow inhalation methacholine , histamine , aerosolize distilled water . These finding person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) represent pulmonary feature commonly see individual asthma . Alternatively , airway inflammation may play role obstructive physiology observe individual tetraplegia . In population , identification cellular inflammation would confirm presence underlie inflammation sputum induction . However , method hard perform due impaired cough . The emerge field exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) biomarkers inflammation offer non-invasive technique define presence , potentially address contribute factor airway inflammation respiratory tract individual tetraplegia . It think EBC composition reflect biochemical change airway line fluid . EBC contain large number mediator , include adenosine , ammonia , hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , isoprostanes , leukotrienes , prostanoids , peptide cytokine . Looking exhale breath profile various biomarkers may use differentiate different pathophysiological mechanism inflammation . In addition , measurement chemokines ( TNF-Î¬ , interleukin ( IL ) -6 ) inflammatory biomarkers ( LTB4 ) EBC blood simultaneously may help differentiate degree local vs. systemic inflammation . Understanding underlying mechanism involve pulmonary dysfunction observe person chronic cervical SCI may identify treatment option , use inhaled steroid . This approach would expect ultimately improve quality life affect individual , decrease rate re-hospitalizations due respiratory complication socioeconomic burden place SCI health care system .</detailed_description>
