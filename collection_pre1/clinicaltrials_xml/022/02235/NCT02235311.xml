	<brief_title>Optimal Dose Proton Pump Inhibitors Following Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There clinical practice guideline management non-variceal , upper gastrointestinal bleed ( UGIB ) . The 2012 guideline release American College Gastroenterology ( ACG ) indicate active bleed non-bleeding visible vessel adherent clot , bolus 80 mg proton pump inhibitor follow continuous infusion 8 mg/hr infusion use . Following 72 hour infusion therapy , oral proton pump inhibitor may use . If clot flat pigment spot clean ulcer base , oral proton pump inhibitor may use management ( without infusion ) ( Laine 2012 ) . There recommendation make versus twice daily proton pump inhibitor . The 2010 American College Physicians guideline recommend follow 72-hour infusion once-daily proton pump inhibitor duration dictate underlying etiology follow UGIB ( Barkun 2012 ) . This recommendation grade 1C , decision support once-daily twice-daily dosing due demonstrate effective ulcer heal patient peptic ulcer disease once-daily dosing , insufficient data suggest twice-daily superior once-daily . There head-to-head trial evaluate once-daily versus twice-daily proton pump inhibitor follow acute management endoscopic bleed . Additionally , study suggest 50 % 60 % proton pump inhibitor use without appropriate indication inappropriate dosage ( Ali 2009 ) .Safety concern increase risk Clostridium difficile infection , community acquire pneumonia , electrolyte abnormality ( hypomagnesemia ) , fracture become prevalent warrant improve risk versus benefit examination proton pump inhibitor include ascertainment least effective dosing ( Ali 2009 , Sheen 2011 ) . Despite recommendation discharge patient acute management UGIB daily PPI therapy , clinical practice use twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy . The objective study examine daily pantoprazole non-inferior twice daily pantoprazole regard ulcer heal acute management UGIB . In addition , evidence emerge regard safety concern proton pump inhibitor , study seek examine daily versus twice daily therapy result difference safety adverse reaction occurrence rebleed , C. difficile diarrhea , pneumonia .</detailed_description>
