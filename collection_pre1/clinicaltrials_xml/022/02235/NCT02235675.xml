	<brief_title>Tack Optimized Balloon Angioplasty Below Knee ( TOBA - BTK ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first man ( FIM ) study collect data support safety performance Intact Vascular Tack-It Endovascular System™ tissue apposition optimize balloon angioplasty . Study primary endpoint : Safety : Composite Major Adverse Limb Events ( MALE ) Peri-procedural Death ( POD ) , assess 1 month . Endpoint include following : - Major amputation - amputation ankle - Re-intervention ( surgical endovascular ) target limb - Procedure-related death - death within 1 month index procedure MALE Device Success : The achievement successful delivery deployment study device ( ) intend target site ( ) successful withdrawal delivery catheter . Technical Success : Device success ( define ) ability Tack resolve post-PTA dissection , demonstrate angiographic patency conclusion procedure . Clinical Success : Ability Tack resolve post-PTA dissection achieve patency conclusion procedure , without procedure relate complication within 48 hour index procedure hospital discharge , whichever sooner . Study secondary endpoint : The following event assess 3 , 6 12 month : - All-cause mortality - Amputation limb ( ankle ) - Amputation free survival - Clinically driven target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) - Clinically drive target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) - Changes Rutherford Clinical Category baseline The following parameter assess 1 , 3 , 6 12 month : - Maintenance luminal patency target lesion TBI ( ≤0.15 decrease ) compare baseline TBI obtain prior discharge - Doppler Exam ( presence signal ) Study observational endpoint : The following parameter assess 6 month ( Per local Standard Care ) : • Angiographic percent diameter stenosis</detailed_description>
