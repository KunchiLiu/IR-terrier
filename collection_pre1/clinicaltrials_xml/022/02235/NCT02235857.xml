	<brief_summary>Liposorber® LA-15 System blood purification therapy selectively remove malignant lipoprotein include low density lipoprotein circulate blood flow rapidly reduce plasma cholesterol level . The system originally develop treatment patient serious dyslipidemia familial hypercholesterolemia apply improve dyslipidemia , common complication nephrotic syndrome find bring improvement dyslipidemic condition nephrotic condition ( e.g , proteinuria hypoproteinemia ) . Although definitive mechanism system may relieve nephrotic syndrome unknown , recognize one alternative therapy refractory nephrotic syndrome include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) Japan refer Guidelines Treatment Nephrotic Syndrome endorse The Japanese Society Nephrology . This study conduct post approval study impose Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE ) order confirm safety efficacy Liposorber® LA-15 System treatment drug-resistant pediatric primary FSGS .</brief_summary>
