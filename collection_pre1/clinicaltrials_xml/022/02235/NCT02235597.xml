	<detailed_description>There different type participant study . Measurements assess questionnaire . The first category include patient , caregiver , clinical operational leader , researcher invite Delphi study identify potential barrier access strategy improve access . The second category include clinic staff ( physician , nurse , medical assistant , registrar , etc . ) patient interview clinic visit identify key process patient ' opinion barrier access . The third category include enrolled patient identify patient population characteristic . The fourth category include patient provider CHCs participate clinic survey assess experience access care satisfaction change workflow efficiency.Category 1 : Delphi study . The investigator invite 50-60 individual ( patient , caregiver , clinical operational leader , researcher ) panel size 40-50 . Category 2 : Key Informant Interviews ( Patients clinic staff ( physician , nurse , medical assistant , registrar , etc ) . The investigator interview least one patient every time go participate clinic . The investigator plan visit participate CHCs approximately every two month . The investigator expect interview approximately 12 patient clinic year , total 84 year seven clinic . Thus , total number patient interview 252 three year ( 12 patient / clinic x 7 clinic = 84 patient per year ) . The interview question related access barrier efficiency clinic process . The investigator receive consent patient start interview . The investigator use IRB-approved consent form study . The investigator interview ten staff member visit identify key process . The investigator anticipate interview approximately 8 provider staff clinic bimonthly visit , well 3-4 bimonthly phone call project period . This expect total 12 staff ( include provider manager ) every two month clinic , 6 x 12 = 72 . This total 72 x 7 = 504 clinic year . Some interview quite brief , lasting minute , others may last 45-60 minute . Category 3 : The investigator collect de-identified patient data patient population care participate CHCs , include age , gender , race , marital status , education , language , income , insurance , distance healthcare facility , reason visit , diagnosis , co-morbidities , number regular visit , visit type duration , provider type , time visit . The investigator work IT and/or quality improvement staff CHCs develop standard procedure retrieve de identify data electronic medical record schedule system . The investigator analyze data determine patient population characteristic care need inform simulation model analysis impact intervention . In 2011 , total number patient see seven partner clinic system approximately 130,000 . However , partner clinic provide care service several site . The investigator choose single site CHC system analyze data patient least two prior visit select site within two year prior baseline . The investigator expect analyze visit 60,000 patient . The data clinic analyze separately . Category 4 ; The investigator anticipate survey sample patient clinic assess familiarity obtain access care , knowledge intervention satisfaction access . This blind ( deidentified survey ) link individual data , study site . The investigator anticipate sample 100 patient site , include approximately 65 patient participate site. , per site . In study , investigator consider special vulnerable population ( fetus , neonate , prisoner , institutionalized individual ) .</detailed_description>
