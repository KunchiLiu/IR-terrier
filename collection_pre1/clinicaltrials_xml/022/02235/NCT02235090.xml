	<brief_summary>Clinical trial organization several neuromuscular disorder ( NMD ) specific issue . Nonambulant status difficulty transportation among . Moreover lot patient NMD poor condition even short transportation able worse . Such situation force researcher limit region recruitment clinical trial exclude trial severe subgroup patient , cause additional issue especially rare disease . The purpose study prove hypothesis possibility reliably monitor patient condition remotely , without trial site visit . Visit-free study design potentially able widen eligible patient population decrease patient dropout rate well burden numerous assessment . Meanwhile assessment frequency could increase enable monitor short fluctuation patient ' condition . Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) rare neuromuscular condition mention issue completely applicable . Direct current stimulation ( DCS ) neural structure well study safe intervention , however , effect SMA patient ' strength durability report today . The investigator suppose investigation DCS action SMA patient population adequate model visit-free design feasibility , reliability sensitivity evaluation .</brief_summary>
