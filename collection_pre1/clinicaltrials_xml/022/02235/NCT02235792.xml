	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate high-frequency range deep brain oscillation ( HFO ) pathologic marker patient undergo deep brain stimulation epilepsy Parkinson disease . Newly develop technology allow chronic record brain signal time clinical stimulation occur . We learn whether HFO correlate disease activity whether HFO change response ongoing stimulation ( potentially give insight underlie mechanism action DBS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate high-frequency range deep brain oscillation ( HFO ) pathologic marker patient undergo deep brain stimulation epilepsy Parkinson disease . Newly develop technology allow chronic record brain signal time clinical stimulation occur . We learn whether HFO correlate disease activity whether HFO change response ongoing stimulation ( potentially give insight underlie mechanism action DBS ) . Study participant undergo DBS way usually do receive new battery ability record brain signal .</detailed_description>
