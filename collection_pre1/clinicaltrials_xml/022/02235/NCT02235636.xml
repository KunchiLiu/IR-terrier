	<brief_title>A Randomized Cross-over Trial Comparison Between Robotic Laparoscopic Suturing Gastric Defect Novices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Da VinciÂ® Robotic Surgical System ( DVRSS ) widely apply perform complex minimally invasive surgical procedure across different specialty . This study aim investigate impact DVRSS surgical proficiency among inexperience novice surgeon compare conventional laparoscopic surgery . Methods Twenty medical student ( n=20 ) without surgical experience enrol . After constructive training basic surgical technique , participant randomly allocate DVR laparoscopy group . Participants ask close five case ( also name five task ) 2cm long incision pig stomach use DVR laparoscopy . Surgical time , successful closure rate pneumatic bursting pressure gastric incision withstand record . In addition , participant performance workload quantify use performance score , scale Global Rating Scale Assessment ( GSA ) NASA-Task Load Index ( NASATLI ) .</detailed_description>
