	<brief_summary>Observational epidemiologic study observe inverse relationship daily dietary magnesium intake blood pressure ( BP ) . Except BP , magnesium may also beneficially affect cardiovascular risk marker . Whether effect translate improve vascular function know . Different vascular function marker various stage pathway diet disease exist . One marker , vascular stiffness , closely related process atherosclerosis , independent cardiovascular risk factor , predictive future cardiovascular event mortality . To examine integrated effect intervention cardiovascular risk , vascular stiffness may therefore serve marker later stage cardiovascular disease development . Therefore , imperative examine 24-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-way parallel-group human intervention study , effect magnesium vascular stiffness . Focus carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , gold standard evaluation vascular elasticity , quantify vascular stiffness . Urinary excretion magnesium use assess dietary magnesium uptake . Furthermore , time course increase magnesium intake change BP , marker reflect vascular function , plasma biomarkers related low-grade inflammation vascular activity measure unravel possible cause-effect relationship .</brief_summary>
