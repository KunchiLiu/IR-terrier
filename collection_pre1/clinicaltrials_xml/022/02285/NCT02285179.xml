	<brief_summary>This study design phase 1 dose escalation study follow randomised phase II study . The study perform three different centre : Addenbrooke &amp; Cambridge university ( Cambridge , UK ) , Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam ) , Vall d'Hebron Hospital ( Barcelona , Spain ) . Three six patient follow one complete cycle therapy ( 28 day ) subsequent enrolment new cohort base safety assessment first cycle documentation dose limit toxicity . To determine safety efficacy tamoxifen combination isoform selective Pi3K inhibitor GDC-0032 compare tamoxifen alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine recommended phase II dose ( RPTD ) GDC-0032 combination tamoxifen hormone receptor positive , HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patient progress prior endocrine treatment .Description toxicity profile , severity frequency adverse event ( observe combination GDC-0032 tamoxifen To evaluate safety tolerability GDC-0032 combination tamoxifen , record adverse event use CTCAE v. 4.0 criterion To describe pharmacokinetics GDC-0032 combination tamoxifen To investigate possibility major drug-drug interaction ( PK ) To obtain proof target inhibition select pharmacodynamic measurement To look preliminary evidence anti-tumour activity To assess status potential biomarkers drug response like PIK3CA gene mutation , relevant proteins phospho-proteins PI3K pathway , circulate tumour DNA ( ct-DNA ) To assess germline DNA sequence pharmacogenetics study</detailed_description>
