	<detailed_description>A randomize , crossover design , acute study complete 21 healthy adult ( age 23 ±1 ; BMI : 23.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2 ) compare 400 kcal lunch meal vary protein quality . Two separate comparison perform . The first comparison consist macronutrient fiber-matched lunch vary protein quality : 24 g beef protein vs. 24 g soy protein . The second comparison match serve size : 1 serve beef ( 24 g protein 0 g fiber ) vs. 1 serve soy ( 14 g protein ; 5 g fiber ) . For treatment , participant complete 2 test day per lunch treatment . During `` Appetite Assessment Days , '' participant report lab consume one lunch meal . Pre 7-h post-lunch appetite craving questionnaire complete throughout test day along plasma , hormonal response , plasma amino acid concentration repeat blood sampling . Ad libitum dinner energy intake also measure . During `` Reward Assessment Days , '' participant report facility consume one lunch meal . Pre post-lunch neural response food stimulus , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , occur follow ad libitum consumption lunch dessert .</detailed_description>
