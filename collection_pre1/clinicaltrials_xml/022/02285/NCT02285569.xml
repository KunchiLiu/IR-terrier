	<brief_title>The Pleth Variability Index Hypotension Caesarean Under Spinal .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : When baby deliver surgical procedure ( Caesarean Section ) woman usually spinal anaesthetic . With spinal anaesthetic local anaesthetic inject spinal fluid make woman numb chest foot allow comfortable awake birth . One common side effect spinal anaesthetic woman 's blood pressure may fall make feel unwell ( rarely ) cause stress unborn baby . During caesarean section blood pressure usually measure every minute may fall quickly detect timely fashion intermittent mean . The monitor Masimo Rainbow SET® ( MRS ) use peg attached finger detect ( amongst thing ) flow blood . One measure take call Pleth Variability Index ( PVI ) ( unlike standard blood pressure measurement ) measure continuously . The investigator use MRS one patient caesarean section spinal anaesthetic PVI see change patient blood pressure fell . Because one case would like try MRS patient see PVI use predict fall blood pressure . To keep close eye blood pressure would use another monitor call finometer . A finometer measure blood pressure continuously mean small cuff place around finger . The finometer allow follow change blood pressure closely see affect PVI reading . AIMS : The aim study see whether change PVI happen fall blood pressure woman spinal anaesthetic caesarean section . METHODOLOGY : The woman exactly anaesthetic would study . The investigator simply use two piece equipment ( MRS Finometer ) see happen blood pressure fall . EXPECTED OUTCOMES : The investigator hope find PVI change blood pressure fall significantly . IMPLICATIONS : If study promising investigator could go perform another study use MRS help decide give drug intravenous fluid stop blood pressure fall .</detailed_description>
