	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale Investigators explore immunotherapy vaccinate well 200 stage III IV melanoma patient Netherlands monocyte-derived dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccines prove DC therapy safe minimal side effect . Cytotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy long view strategy directly impact viability tumor cell , immune system contribute little efficacy . The commonly hold opinion chemotherapy immunotherapy could combine myelo-suppressive effect chemotherapeutic agent . However , become increasingly obvious chemotherapy also possess capacity trigger tumor antigen release danger signal manner provokes engagement innate adaptive immunity may capitalize upon . Small proof-of-concept clinical trial cancer patient indicate efficacy anti-cancer vaccine may indeed enhance chemotherapy [ 2 ] . Also preliminary observation indicate chemotherapeutic agent , particular platinum compound ( cisplatin , carboplatin oxaliplatin ) immunogenic may contribute reverse tumor cell induce immunosuppression/immune deviation . Investigators hypothesize DC vaccination , combine conventional anti-tumor treatment chemotherapy , eradicate large number cancer cell , may allow T cell clear remain cancer cell provide immunological memory prevent relapse . 2 . Objectives This exploratory study primary objective immunogenicity feasibility combine chemotherapy-DC vaccination . The secondary objective toxicity clinical efficacy . This study provide important data immunological efficacy DC immunochemotherapy . 3 . Study design This study open label randomize phase II study . 4 . Study population Our study population consist melanoma patient , expression melanoma associate tumor antigens gp100 tyrosinase . Melanoma patient regional lymph node metastasis radical lymph node dissection perform within 2 month inclusion study ( refer stage III ) melanoma patient measurable distant metastasis ( refer stage IV ) include . 5 . Main study endpoints The primary objective study investigate immunogenicity feasibility combine chemotherapy-DC vaccination . The secondary objective investigate toxicity clinical response ( stage IV ) upon DC immunochemotherapy .</detailed_description>
