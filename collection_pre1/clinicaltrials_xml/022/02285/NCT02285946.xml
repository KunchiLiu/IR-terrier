	<brief_summary>During mechanical ventilation , alveolar recruitment maneuver ( ARM ) apply positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) ( generally 30 cm H2O ) period least 30 second . The realization MRA one three main element mechanical ventilation call `` protective '' . This ventilatory strategy , originally describe ventilation acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , pulmonary abdominal surgery base decrease tidal volume , optimization PEEP realization MRA . Protective ventilation limit occurrence atelectasis , surdistentions , ultimately , significantly decrease postoperative complication . The MRA currently recommend `` major '' surgery . Most spine surgery ( eg transpedicular fixation ) use definition , MRA indicate commonly use . This type surgery require position patient prone position ( DV ) . The DV modifies compliance chest respiratory characteristic change ( increase insufflation pressure ) hemodynamic ( decrease venous return ) patient . Respiratory haemodynamic effect MRA make VIS major spine surgery know . The aim observational study , non-interventional , compare hemodynamic respiratory effect MRA perform DV MRA perform prone position ( DD ) . The investigator hypothesis respiratory hemodynamic consequence MRA perform DV different conduct DD . A well understanding hemodynamic respiratory characteristic MRA perform DV would provide tailored type surgery respiratory optimization strategy reduce respiratory complication surgery .</brief_summary>
