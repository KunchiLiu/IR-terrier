	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Exercise Stroke Rehabilitation Inpatients Who Are Unable Stand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Sitting balance may affect stroke , result functional impairment reduce mobility . Early return sit balance predicts great return motor function mobility stroke . Task-specific therapy effective patient must motivate perform exercise repeatedly great benefit . Virtual reality training ( VRT ) allow patient exercise interact video game interface . It enjoyable may encourage repetition therapeutic exercise . Past work laboratory show stand balance exercise perform VRT produce additional improvement gait speed leg function traditional inpatient rehabilitation ( 1 ) . Because legislative change Ontario stroke rehabilitation inpatient today stand independently . There study effect VRT sit balance . Purpose To assess whether additional sit balance exercise perform via VRT improve sit balance sit function ( ex . reach ) stroke rehabilitation inpatient . Hypothesis The addition VRT sit balance significantly improve sit balance function , beyond gain realize traditional inpatient rehabilitation . Experimental Approach In blinded randomize control trial fund Heart &amp; Stroke Foundation , 76 participant stroke recruited inpatient rehabilitation unit . This number provide enough power detect large effect size ( 0.83 ) primary outcome measure account 20 % drop-out rate . Individuals medically stable sit least 20 minute without trunk support stand independently one minute eligible . These criterion target selection need work sit balance . Participants randomize experimental control group . Participants group perform VRT 30-50 minute daily 10-12 session , addition rehabilitation program . VRT deliver Jintronix software motion capture technology . Exercises experimental group challenge sit balance control , reach shift base support . Control group exercise require limited hand arm movement , equalize additional time spent engage activity without work trunk balance . Control group participant strap chair minimize trunk movement . A CONFORMat pressure mat use monitor centre pressure change intervention . Outcome measure perform pre- , post- 1 month post-intervention , assessor blind group allocation . The primary outcome measure Function Sitting Test . Secondary outcome measure : Ottawa Sitting Scale , Reaching Performance Scale , Wolf Motor Function Test quantitative measure postural control perform sit . Two-way analysis variance [ factor : time ( pre- , post- , 1 month post- ) group ( experimental , control ) ] Tukey 's post-hoc analysis use test effect VRT outcome measure . Significance Knowledge Translation If show addition sit balance exercise via VRT traditional rehabilitation improve sit balance function , VRT may add inpatient ' rehabilitation therapy . The ultimate goal improve quality patient ' life decrease burden caregiver . Since Jintronix system portable , hope acquire funding several unit . We would able ass use VRT therapists inpatient outpatient stroke . ( 1 ) McEwen D et al . Stroke 2014 ; 45:1853-1855</detailed_description>
