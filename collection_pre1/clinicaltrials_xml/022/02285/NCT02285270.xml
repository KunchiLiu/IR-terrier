	<detailed_description>Brown adipose tissue form fat able metabolize glucose order generate heat . When active , convert great deal glucose thermal energy . Activation brown fat could potentially help combat obesity increase basal metabolic rate . However , activation signal brown fat poorly understood . In mouse model , recently show significant circadian variation brown fat activation also discover gene responsible circadian change ( Gerhart-Hines et al , Nature 2013 ) . Specifically , show wild type mouse , brown fat activation high night low day . Whether human brown fat activation circadian component currently unknown . Showing brown fat activation human subject similar circadian rhythm mouse would important step understand signal activation may help elucidate potential strategy control activation . Positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) hybrid image modality allow image positron emit isotope fluorine-18 ( F-18 ) along anatomic image use x-rays . The physiologic information PET component co-registered anatomic information CT component , permit accurate localization quantification physiologic process . The common clinically used positron emit radiopharmaceutical F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) . It glucose analog take glucose transporter phosphorylated FDG-6P hexokinase . However , isomerase , next enzyme glycolytic pathway , inactive FDG-6P largely trap cell . Therefore , FDG PET/CT give map relative amount glucose uptake phosphorylation interval injection scan . Activated brown fat robust FDG uptake intense signal see . Therefore , FDG PET/CT use determine whether person activate brown fat time scan well quantify overall level metabolism fat . Our primary objective gather pilot data potential presence circadian variation brown fat uptake young , healthy , lean male volunteer . We plan perform two FDG PET/CT scan 12 hour apart patient remain temperature diet control environment lead scan . Our primary hypothesis brown fat activity high day night ( human mouse circadian rhythm reverse ) . We also pair measurement cortisol FDG injection cortisol level provide valuable independent information circadian rhythm .</detailed_description>
