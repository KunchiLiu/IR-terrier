	<brief_summary>Background : Less 20 % type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patient different healthcare setting achieve treatment goal prevent cardiometabolic disease . A personalised approach share decision make increase percentage . Because ADDITION-Europe study demonstrate two ( almost ) equally effective treatment slightly different intensity , may good start point discus patient diabetes treatment , take account intensity treatment , clinical factor patient ' preference . The aim study evaluate whether approach increase proportion treatment goal T2DM patient achieve . Methods : In cluster-randomised trial 40 primary care practice participate 2009 ADDITION Study , 150 T2DM patient 60 - 80 year , know T2DM 8-15 year , include . Practices randomise second time , i.e . intervention practice ADDITION study could control practice current study vice versa . For GPs intervention group 2-hour training share decision making ( SDM ) develop well decision support tool use consultation . These GPs plan first visit patient decide intensity treatment , personalise target priority treatment . The control group continue treatment allocate ADDITION study ( treatment-as-before ) . Follow-up : 24 month . The primary outcome proportion patient achieve three treatment goal ( HbA1c , blood pressure , total cholesterol ) 24 month . Secondary outcome proportion patient achieve five treatment goal ( HbA1c , blood pressure , total cholesterol , body weight , smoke ) , evaluation SDM process ( SDM-Q9 ) , satisfaction treatment ( DTSQ ) , wellbeing quality life ( W-BQ12 , ADD QoL-19 ) , health status ( SF-36 , EQ-5D ) coping ( DCMQ ) . The proportion achieve treatment goal compare group estimate relative risk meeting treatment target . For secondary outcome mixed model use . Discussion : To achieve optimal diabetes care high proportion achieve individualised treatment goal , SDM approach include multi-faceted decision support tool might useful . An intervention support decision tool design .</brief_summary>
