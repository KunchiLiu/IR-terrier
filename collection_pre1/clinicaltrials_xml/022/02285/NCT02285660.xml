	<brief_summary>The aim high dose radiotherapy treatment deliver enough radiation tumour kill cancer cell time give low dose radiation normal part body reduce side effect treatment . This require cancer specialist accurately identify area cancer compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PETCT ) scan use radioactive sugar inject patient . This sugar go cancer cell show bright spot PET scan , allow doctor see tumours accurately . Some cancer move breathing , example lung , pancreas oesophageal ( gullet ) cancer . Fourdimensional CT scanning ( 4DCT ) special type CT scan allows motion tumour see measure accurately . This information use help ensure radiotherapy correctly treat move tumour . The aim study see possible benefit combine PET 4DCT get 4D PETCT scan tumour move breathing . This study divide three cancer types; lung , low oesophagus pancreatic cancer . First investigator go test use 4D PETCT radiotherapy planning tumour see helps doctor identify cancer . Secondly , investigator go see 4D PETCT help show area within cancer potentially active . This might allow u target high dose area , could potentially improve chance control cure cancer . Patients ' standard treatment alter participate study .</brief_summary>
