	<brief_title>One-stop-shop Study Treatment Basal Cell Carcinoma Using Reflectance Confocal Microscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common cancer diagnose white population worldwide . The rise incidence BCCs become major worldwide public health problem ( 1,11 ) . Between 1973 2009 , European standardize rate quadruple 40 165 per 100,000 person-years men 34 157 woman , probably result intensive UV exposure ( 12 ) . This support previous publish epidemiological literature indicate ultraviolet radiation important risk factor BCC significant increase among outdoor worker ( 13,14 ) . Despite low mortality BCC , multiple recur tumor confer high morbidity considerable burden health care provider health budget . Although BCC seem high effect patient ' quality life , patient suffer BCC definitely interested efficacy , low recurrence rate cosmetic outcome therapies. ( 15 ) . Meanwhile resource available hospital increase proportionally therefore optimize effectiveness present treatment modality daily dermatologic practice mandatory ( 16 ) . Clinically , BCC characterize small , translucent , pearly papule , raise teleangiectatic edge ( 17 ) . Most BCC occur sun-exposed skin head neck area ( 18,19 ) . Sensitivity positive predictive value clinical diagnose BCC dermatologist report 95.4 % 85.9 % , respectively ( 20 ) . However , divide BCC subtypes always possible upon clinical assessment . To date , histological analysis punch biopsy remain golden standard confirm clinical diagnosis BCCs divide follow subtypes : nodular ( nBCC ) , micronodular ( mnBCC ) , infiltrate ( iBCC ) superficial ( sBCC ) ( 10 ) . Of , nBCC sBCC less aggressive growth pattern comparison mnBCC iBCC . Additionally , mixed type BCC ( mtBCC ) define combination subtypes frequently compose aggressive subtypes ( 21 ) . Surgical excision remain standard treatment , Mohs micrographic surgery typically utilized high-risk lesion ( 22 ) . Based upon histological growth pattern , BCC surgically remove margin either 3mm ( nBCC sBCC ) 5mm ( mnBCC , iBCC ) accordance current Dutch guideline ( 10 ) . Due rise incidence BCC need efficient , non-invasive method diagnose BCCs . The use real-time vivo reflectance confocal microscopy ( RCM ) diagnose BCCs proven successful address need . Various study demonstrate RCM safe accurate ( sensitivity specificity ) diagnose BCCs ( 2-6 ) . Reported sensitivity specificity RCM diagnose BCC range 83 % -100 % 79 % -97 % , respectively ( 7 ) . Furthermore , Peppelman et al . Longo et al . recently report RCM feature might divide nodular , micronodular , superficial infiltrative subtypes BCC ( 8,9 ) . In 2012 , van der Geer et al report feasibility one-stop-shop ( OSS ) concept treatment skin cancer patient ( 23 ) . One-stop-shop implies day initial outpatient clinic consultation , diagnosis treatment plan take place . In study , pre-operative frozen section histology use confirm BCC diagnosis subtype . The mean throughput time 4 hour 7 min , complication observe , patient satisfaction high ( 23 ) . Incorporating RCM non-invasive diagnostic tool BCC OSS concept lesion suitable conventional surgical excision might reduce time clinical diagnosis treatment , administrative workload cost . The aim study assess efficacy safety one-stop-shop concept , use real-time vivo reflectance confocal microscopy ( Vivascope 1500 ; Lucid Technologies , Henrietta , NY , USA ) diagnostic tool , prior surgical management new primary BCCs , subtypes , general population .</detailed_description>
