Rome III criterion Irritable Bowel Syndrome 4 . Assessment diet use Anti-Cancer Council Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire ( ACCVFFQ ) . 3 . Subjects also ask provide background information regard travel past 4 month current place ( duration ) residence factor may potentially affect microbiome profile . 4 . Patients weigh height measure determine body mass index ( BMI ) . 5 . Those meet study criterion provide collection kit instruct appropriate fecal sample collection . The sample first bowel movement day . Participants blood sample drawn examine serum level IL-6 , TNF- α CRP . Fecal Sample Collection Patients healthy control collect fecal sample home use investigator well-established protocol . Stool sample collect transfer sterile screw cap sample jar place standard household freezer . The sample transport cool pad study personnel MacAnxiety Research Centre store study freezer transport McMaster University . In laboratory , part stool sample transfer four 2-ml cryovials snap frozen use liquid nitrogen molecular analysis microbiota . PHASE II : Participants interested pharmacological treatment OCD symptom complete phase 1 , option continue phase 2 study . Here participant receive 12-weeks standard open-label treatment SSRI . During 12 week period , subject attend 5 additional visit . The first 3 visit occur every 2 week visit 4 5 occur week 8 12 treatment . As per APA guideline ( APA 2007 ) participant receive 4-6 week treatment optimal dosage . The visit organize follow : 1 . Baseline Visit : This visit correspond procedure outline Part One study . Participants also begin open-label SSRI treatment visit , blood stool sample collect . In Phase clinician also complete follow scale visit : . Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI-I ) - Clinician-rated ii . Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) - Clinician-rated 2 . During visit ( visits 2-5 ) participant assess treat physician determine whether modification SSRI dosage warrant . Dosage increase base response present dose experience side effect . The clinician-rated Y-BOCS MADRS also complete visit . Patients complete ACCVFFQ visit 3 ( week 4 ) . The medication dosage increase visit 5 . 3 . Visit 6 ( week 12 ) : Participants undergo usual assessment , treatment response also determine visit ( CGI-I score ≤ 2 well 30 % drop YBOCS score ) . Participants provide collection kit instruct appropriate fecal sample collection ( outline ) . The sample collect first bowel movement day . Blood sample draw local Gamma-Dynacare lab examine serum level IL-6 , TNF α CRP . Patient diet also assess use ACCVFFQ . 4 . After return fecal sample complete bloodwork , participant begin 2-week taper period subject instruct gradually reduce dosage prescribe SSRI . Participants option continue treatment situation wish .</detailed_description>
