	<brief_summary>During lumbar spine fusion surgery intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring routine use prevention possible nerve injury placement screw pedicle . Pedicle screw stimulation test perform assess screw placement encroach nerve root . Relative distance pedicle screw neighbouring root estimate intensity current require activate root appropriate muscle . A properly place screw distinguish perforate pedicle wall high minimum level electrical current need elicit muscle response . The minimum level deem threshold . This test base compound muscle action potential ( CMAP ) use neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) avoid possible cause false negative result screw stimulation test . Neuromuscular block agent , routine use anesthesia , effect muscle action potential . When NMBA use current stimulus depolarize number axon associate muscle response present low amplitude percentage motor fiber block activity NMBA . At point , strong stimulus need recruit additional axons/muscle fiber , hence , measure threshold elevate . Train four ( TOF ) test method use determine level neuromuscular blockade , stimulation peripheral nerve follow induced muscle contraction . Interpretation muscle contraction may subjective ( visual ) objective ( quantitative ) method . Quantitative TOF test may use prior screw stimulation test calculate T4/T1 ratio obtain quantitative value show level neuromuscular blockade . Residual neuromuscular blockade may present screw stimulation test , effect accuracy test situation clearly investigated recent study . The purpose study would determine change screw stimulation threshold different range neuromuscular blockade.Therefore , acceptable neuromuscular blockade threshold ( determine TOF test ) acceptable obtain reliable screw stimulation test determine . Screw stimulation test may perform neuromuscular blockade absent compare repeat screw stimulation test neuromuscular blockade present . Different level neuromuscular blockade may provide different result screw stimulation test , difference statistically significant , induced neuromuscular blockade level may set threshold value , acceptable obtain reliable test result .</brief_summary>
