	<brief_title>Protective Efficacy Flublok® Quadrivalent Versus Licensed Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Adults ≥50 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study establish Flublok Quadrivalent non-inferior fully license ( traditional approval status ) quadrivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV4 ) protect laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza disease ≥50 year age population . Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( rtPCR ) use confirm influenza infection type strain involve , molecular methodology demonstrate sensitive traditional methodology , e.g . culture . For rtPCR-positive clinical sample , reserve aliquot processed culture , antigenic similarity HA present study vaccine test . In various clinical study investigator demonstrate immune response influenza A viruses improved result high hemagglutinin content . Furthermore , influenza virus disease hospitalization associate influenza-related illness old adult ( &gt; 50 year ) considerably reduce ( 90 % ) follow vaccination TIV , even though circulate influenza A strain antigenically dissimilar vaccine . However , recently Skowronski et al . report low influenza vaccine effectiveness 2012-2013 associate antigenic drift instead related mutation egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain . Flublok manufacture use recombinant technology contain mutation responsible report low effectiveness may thus offer improved protection mutation describe induced process adapt influenza virus growth egg .</detailed_description>
