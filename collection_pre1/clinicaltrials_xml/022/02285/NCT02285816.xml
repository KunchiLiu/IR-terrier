	<brief_title>MG1 Maraba/MAGE-A3 , With Without Adenovirus Vaccine , With Transgenic MAGE-A3 Insertion Patients With Incurable MAGE-A3-Expressing Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose first phase study ( phase I ) find dose new therapy , MG1 Maraba/MAGE-A3 ( MG1MA3 ) virus give alone combination Adenovirus/MAGE-A3 ( AdMA3 ) virus . In first part study , patient may receive Maraba virus , Adenovirus viruses . To identify high safe dose Maraba virus alone combination study start dose low one cause side effect animal . Participants give one therapy watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If serious side effect see patient first dose level , dose MG1MA3 may lower subsequent patient . If side effect serious , potential participant ask join study give high dos . This continue maximum feasible dose level reach one low dose found cause serious temporary side effect . Doses high give .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PHASE I : Patients must histologically confirm , unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumour positive expression MAGEA3 ( primary metastatic lesion ) know life prolong standard therapy . PHASE II : Patients must histologically confirm , unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumour positive expression MAGEA3 ( primary metastatic lesion ) follow : 1 . Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) specifically adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma . 2 . Breast cancer 3 . Esophageal/GEJ cancer/gastric In phase II patient may treat refractory , stable post treatment response first line therapy . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . At least one site disease must unidimensionally measurable CT IV contrast follow : Chest xray ≥ 20 mm CT scan ( slice thickness ≤ 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; Longest diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; Measured short axis All radiology study must perform within 14 day prior registration ( within 21 day negative ) . Patients must least one additional tumour mass amenable core needle excisional biopsy ( Note FNA acceptable ) measurable lesion use target lesion . Patients must consent willing able undergo least two core needle biopsy lesion . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients must receive least one prior standard first line regimen advance metastatic disease . The regimen may cytotoxic chemotherapy , target therapy , hormonal therapy ( e.g . anastrozole ) immunotherapy provide consider standard first line therapy . There limit number prior regimen investigator patient carefully consider likelihood benefit immunologic therapy heavily pretreated patient . For phase II , patient may enrol prior disease progression , provide complete first line therapy document stable disease two consecutive tumour assessment ( i.e . evidence tumour regression therapy ) : NSCLC patient may enter minimum 46 cycle first line combination chemotherapy ; patient &gt; 70 year single agent regimen acceptable . If patient document EGFR ALK mutation , treatment may receive may include EGFR inhibitor ALK inhibitor first line therapy . Breast cancer patient may enter minimum 6 cycle first line therapy . Patients metastatic/recurrent esophageal carcinoma may enter first line chemotherapy metastatic disease . Washout period last day prior treatment planned start treatment long one follow : two week standard cycle length prior regimen 10 halflives investigational drug . 30 day since last dose ipilumumab PR1/PDL1 therapy . Patients must recover treatment related toxicity prior registration ( unless grade 1 , irreversible consider clinically significant ) . Progression must document post radiotherapy give site measurable disease . Patients may prior radiation therapy . A minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) must elapse last dose radiation date registration ( 14 day single palliative fraction radiation nontarget lesion ) . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior registration ( unless grade 1 , irreversible consider clinically significant ) . Previous surgery permit . A minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) must elapse major surgery date registration ( 7 day minor surgery ) , provide wound healing occur . Laboratory requirement do within 7 day prior registration : WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L absolute neutrophil ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L platelet ≥ 75 x 10^9/L INR ≤ 1.2 bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL ( upper normal limit ) AST ALT ≤ 3.0 x UNL ≤ 5.0 x UNL patient liver metastasis serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min serum Phosphate &gt; 0.8mMol/L ( grade 01 ) Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior registration prior test consider study specific Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . pretreatment biopsy must do within 5 work day registration treatment begin within 5 work day pretreatment biopsy ( max . 10 work day registration ) . Patients history active current malignancy require active treatment Patients know symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients treat radiologic clinical evidence stable brain metastasis , eligible provide stable least 3 month , asymptomatic require corticosteroid ( must discontinue steroid least 1 month prior entry ) . Patients receive concurrent treatment anticancer therapy investigational agent . Patients prior treatment AdVAC , MG1MA3 MAGEA3 target therapy . Pregnant lactating woman . Men woman childbearing potential agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include , limited : 1 . History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder ( e.g . uncontrolled psychotic disorder ) would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement . 2 . Active uncontrolled serious infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) history opportunistic infection associate immunodeficient state . 3 . Significant immunodeficiency due underlie illness ( e.g . know HIV/AIDS ) and/or medication ( e.g . systemic corticosteroid ) . 4 . Known myeloproliferative disorder require systemic therapy . 5 . Other medical condition might aggravate study treatment . Patients uncontrolled preexist cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction . Patients household contact meet follow criterion ineligible study entry unless alternate living arrangement make : 1 . Women pregnant nursing infant 2 . Children &lt; 12 month old 3 . Anyone significant immunodeficiency due underlie illness ( e.g . HIV/AIDS ) and/or medication ( e.g . systemic corticosteroid ) Use antiviral medication , steroid , immunosuppressive agent ( cyclosporine , interferon ) immunization ( include flu shot ) within 14 day prior registration . Use antiviral , antiplatelet , anticoagulation medication discontinue within 14 day enrollment . Patients disease/tumour invade major vascular structure ( e.g . carotid artery ) , tumour related impend bowel obstruction clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulate ascites , pericardial pleural effusion . Patients condition likely result splenic dysfunction ( e.g . splenectomy , sickle cell anemia , radiation spleen ≥ 20Gy , congenital asplenism ) . Patients ≥ grade 2 dyspnea and/or requirement supplemental oxygen . Patients important pulmonary disease must complete 6 minute ambulation test O2 state ≥ 90 % eligible</criteria>
