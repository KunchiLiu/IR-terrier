	<brief_summary>This research study examine safety feasibility aspirin without Simvastatin solid tumor patient risk VTE ( Venous Thromboembolism - blood clot - arm , let , lung , part body ) . One-fifth thrombotic ( clot ) event occur patient cancer . Changes sP-selectin used measure efficacy . We choose sP-selectin primary marker role hemostasis , predictive thrombosis cancer patient promise preliminary data . We expect sP-selectin level elevate patient therapy aspirin and/or statin , level fall significantly treatment , rise observation phase , fall second study period . Patients take part study diagnose solid tumor cancer consider intermediate high risk VTE . The standard care give chemotherapy solid tumor treat clot develop use blood thinner .</brief_summary>
