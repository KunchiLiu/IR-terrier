	<brief_summary>The main purpose phase I study general determine best dose ( `` maximum tolerated dose '' ) drug , find common side effect . The main purpose phase I component study specifically determine best dose experimental drug MEK162 find whether drug safe child adolescent tumor grow come back despite standard therapy . Another purpose study measure concentration drug blood help understand much drug get body quickly drug remove body . Another purpose study determine whether MEK162 turn Ras/Raf/MAP pathway expect measure pathway blood cell . Finally , study , investigator hope start find whether MEK162 cause different type tumor child shrink stop growing . The main purpose phase II component study determine whether MEK162 cause specific type tumor child adolescent shrink stop growing . These specific type tumor include low-grade glioma , tumor patient genetic condition call neurofibromatosis type 1 , tumor think cause abnormal activation Ras/Raf/MEK molecular pathway . Another purpose study researcher learn whether specific abnormality DNA tumor help predict whether tumor respond MEK162 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study MEK162 Children With Ras/Raf Pathway Activated Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SUMMARY : Phase 1 : Patients non-hematologic malignancy recurrent , progressive , refractory standard up-front therapy receive MEK162 define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , toxicity profile . Phase 2 : Patients recurrent progressive tumor signal ras/raf pathway standard up-front therapy treat three stratum define activity MEK162 . Stratum 1 : Pediatric patient recurrent progressive low-grade glioma ( LGG ) characterize BRAF truncate fusion ( KIAA1549 similar translocation ) . Stratum 2 : Pediatric patient neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) recurrent progressive LGG . Stratum 3 : Pediatric patient recurrent progressive tumor think involve ras/raf/MAP pathway include strata 1 2 . This include LGG include strata 1 2 ( i.e. , LGG without BRAF truncate fusion patient without NF1 ) , tumor LGG patient NF1 , tumor know activate BRAF , NRAS KRAS mutation . Target validation phase : Patient enrol phase 2 component ( stratum ) tumor biopsy resection clinically indicate . Patients receive MEK162 7 21 day prior surgery . Samples analyzed concentration drug target inhibition . Length therapy : Protocol treatment last approximately 48 week start MEK162 absence significant toxicity . Treatment administer base dose escalation schema phase 1 . Patients phase 2 component trial also receive plan 48 week therapy . Those undergoing planned tumor resection base clinical criterion eligible receive 7-21 day treatment MEK162 prior surgical procedure . Imaging assess response obtain end cycle 1 ( +/- 1 week ) , end cycle 3 ( +/- 2 week ) every three cycle thereafter ( +/- 2 week ) . A cycle consist 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) MEK162 give continuously . Patients derive benefit may continue therapy beyond study completion protocol specific evaluation ( survival progression ) conclude one year . All patient follow progression end point .</detailed_description>

Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour first dose MEK162 . Patient must pregnant breastfeeding . Patients childbearing childfathering potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . Patient must able take oral/enteral medication . Patient , parent , legal guardian must able understand willing provide inform consent . Patients must recover effect prior therapy . Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . History Gilbert 's syndrome . Patients receive anticancer experimental drug therapy . Use hematopoietic growth factor within 2 week prior initiation therapy . Any investigational agent within 2 week ≤ 5 x t1/2 ( whichever longer ) start study therapy Patients undergone surgery ≤ 3 week recover side effect procedure prior receive study drug . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , impaired gastrointestinal function , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History current evidence retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) predispose factor RVO ( e.g . uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , history hyperviscosity hypercoagulability syndrome ) History retinal degenerative disease Prior therapy MEK inhibitor . Impairment gastrointestinal function ( e.g. , active ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) . Patients neuromuscular disorder associate elevated CK ( e.g. , inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , spinal muscular atrophy ) .</criteria>
