	<brief_summary>This observational clinical trial investigate follow perioperative index relate cardiac surgery : 1 . The significance measurement involve leave heart relaxation ( LV diastolic function ) relation outcome measure . 2 . The significance measurement involve right heart relaxation function itrs relation outcome measure . 3 . The influence drug enoximone outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past two decade , perioperative TOE become routine part monitor set cardiac surgery . In many centre around world nearly 100 % pateints undergoing cardiac surgery monitor use modality . There several study observational review suggest intraoperative TOE change management thus indirectly influence outcome patient undergo valve , aortic bypass graft surgery . Certainly centre The Heart Hospital , routine practce perform intraoperative TOE patient undergo cardiac surgery order guide surgical anaesthetic management patient . Despite use TOE little evidence TOE influence patient relate outcome , morbidity mortality . Several advance occur year involve good technology image heart TOE along development novel measurement heart function . As technology evolve , many modality measurement validate set cardiac surgery . In observational clincal trial aim investigate following : 1 . The significance measurement involve leave heart relaxation ( LV diastolic function ) relation outcome measure . 2 . The significance measurement involve right heart relaxation function itrs relation outcome measure . 3 . The influence drug enoximone outcome measure . While many measurement validate care medical patient , examine surgical setting . In addition , ability predict outcome never test . We believe study help u answer important question .</detailed_description>
