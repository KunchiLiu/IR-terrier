	<brief_title>GDF15 Based TPF Induction Chemotherapy OSCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy regard effective way reduce downgrade locally advance aggressive cancer , improve chance eradication locoregional lesion radical surgery and/or radiotherapy . However , still debate clinical value induction chemotherapy patient advance resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma . A prospective , open label , parallel , interventional , randomize control trial TPF induction chemotherapy indicate difference overall survival , disease free survival , local regional recurrence free survival metastasis free survival experimental group control group , however , subgroup analysis prove induction chemotherapy TPF protocol could benefit patient GDF15 high expression cN0 locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma . ( Yang et al , GDF15 potential predictive biomarker TPF induction chemotherapy promote tumorigenesis progression oral squamous cell carcinoma ) This prospective , interventional , randomize control trial prove predictive biomarker cN0 patient high GDF15 expression benefit TPF induction chemotherapy . The patient would receive TPF induction chemotherapy follow radical surgery post-operative radiotherapy ( experimental group ) radical surgery post-operative radiotherapy ( control group ) . The study power 80 % basis assume 2-year survival rate 85 % experiment group 66 % control group , use two-sided log-rank test level significance 0.05 . The recruitment period would 2 year , follow-up period would 2 year , 15 % patient would drop early lose follow-up . A maximum 36 patient per group recruit stplan 4.5 software calculation . （Department Biostatics , MD Anderson Cancer Center , University Texas，USA）The patient experimental group receive TPF induction chemotherapy 2 cycle follow radical surgery post-operative radiotherapy . The palpable edge primary lesion ( long shortest axis ) mark induction chemotherapy least four point , 0.5cm away . The patient control group receive radical surgery post-operative radiotherapy . Induction chemotherapy : For patient randomly assign receive TPF induction chemotherapy , peripherally inserted central catheter firstly insert intravenous infusion , docetaxel ( dose 75mg/m2 body surface area ) administer 2-hour intravenous infusion , follow intravenous cisplatin ( 75 mg/m2 ) , administer period 2 3 hour . Then , 5-Fu ( 750 mg/m2/day ) administer 120-hour continuous intravenous infusion 5 day . Induction chemotherapy give every 3 week 2 cycle , unless disease progression , unacceptable toxic effect , withdrawal consent patient . Dexamethasone give docetaxel infusion prevent docetaxel-related hypersensitivity reaction , skin toxic effect , fluid retention ; prophylactic antibiotic also give start day 5 cycle 3 day . Hydration diuretic antiemetic treatment also perform . Primary prophylaxis recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor suggest . Chemotherapy dose reduction allow grade 3/4 toxicity occur cycle 1 : 25 % 50 % dose reduction three chemotherapy agent suggest grade 3 grade 4 hematologic toxicity gastrointestinal toxicity , respectively ; 25 % 50 % cisplatin dose reduction suggest grade 3 grade 4 renal toxicity , respectively . Surgery perform least 2 week completion induction chemotherapy . Surgery : Radical resection primary lesion full neck dissection ( functional radical ) proper reconstruction ( pedicle free flap ) perform . The safety margin primary lesion 1.5cm far away palpable margin lesion ; patient receive induction chemotherapy , safety margin 1.0cm away mark place induction chemotherapy , ensure extent surgery arm . Frozen section surgery perform confirm adequate margin . Post-operative radiotherapy : Radiotherapy arrange 4 6 week surgery . Routine external beam radiotherapy , conformal intensity modulate radiotherapy perform , dose 1.8-2 Gy ( Gray ) /day , 5 days/week 6 week , totally 54-60 Gy , patient high risk feature , positive surgical margin , extra capsular nodal spread , vascular embolism , total dose 66 Gy suggest . A complete medical history obtain tumor assessment perform baseline . Clinical tumor response assess clinical evaluation image study characterize accord criterion response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( version 1.0 ) surgery . Post-operative pathologic response assess post-operative pathologic examination good bad response . A good response define absence tumor cell ( pathologic complete response ) presence scatter foci tumor cell ( minimal residual disease &lt; 10 % viable tumor cell ) ; otherwise , bad pathologic response define . Toxic effect assess weekly completion induction chemotherapy radiotherapy accord common terminology criterion adverse event ( version 3.0 ) . Overall survival calculate date randomization date death ; disease free survival calculate date randomization tumor recurrence distant metastasis death cause ; locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis free survival calculate date randomization locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis tumor death cause . Time locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis calculate date finishing treatment tumor locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis . Patients monitor every three month first two year , every six month next 2 year , year thereafter death data censoring .</detailed_description>
