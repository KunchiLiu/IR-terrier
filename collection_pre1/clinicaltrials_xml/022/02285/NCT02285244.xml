	<brief_title>Sotrastaurin Acetate Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Leukemia , Prolymphocytic Leukemia , Richter 's Transformation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective clinical response rate AEB071 ( sotrastaurin acetate ) treatment patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic leukemia ( SLL ) /prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) /Richter 's transformation ( RT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility tolerability long-term administration fix dose AEB071 patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL/PLL . II . To examine select downstream pharmacodynamic effect population patient receive AEB071 include assessment wingless-type MMTV integration site family ( WNT ) signal pathway . III . To determine feasibility tolerability AEB071 treatment patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) well gain preliminary data regard efficacy patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine proportion patient select germline somatic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) alteration , include B-cell receptor ( BCR ) pathway . II . Determine mutational transcriptional status key gene affect response therapy may affect response prior therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive sotrastaurin acetate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day least every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
