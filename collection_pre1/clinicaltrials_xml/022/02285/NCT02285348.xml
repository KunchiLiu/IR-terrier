	<detailed_description>Ataxia telangiectasia ( A-T ) devastate human recessive disorder characterize progressive cerebellar ataxia , immunodeficiency , chromosomal instability , cancer susceptibility . For clinician scientist underlie mechanism process neurodegeneration lead loss cerebellar neuron neurological function largely unknown . In addition surrogate marker neurological degeneration disease progression exist . Three major factor may responsible progression neurodegeneration : 1 . A-T patient exhibit elevated level reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reduce anti-oxidative capacity . It propose ROS responsible destruction purkinje cell cerebellum . 2 . Ongoing low grade inflammation due immunodeficiency . Elevated serum interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) level patient A-T postulated systemic inflammation may contribute disease phenotype . How inflammation neurodegeneration interact , however , matter ongoing debate . 3 . Low level growth hormone ( GH ) . Extracerebellar MRI - lesion A-T go along deficiency GH axis , high Ataxia score advance age . The aim proposal investigate oxidative stress , low grade inflammation , tissue breakdown biomarkers cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , fluid direct contact central nervous system ( CNS ) , A-T patient . - To analyse functional gene expression oxidative stress low grade inflammation mean reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) cytometric bead array . - To characterize alteration protein expression relate A-T , LC/MS-based quantitative proteomic analysis CSF control A-T patient - To compare alteration protein expression level CSF MRI finding different age group classical A-T. - To determine candidate protein whose relative expression level could use surrogate marker disease progression ? - To establish analysis system basis multiplex ELISA-technique evaluate potential candidates/surrogate marker disease progression large cohort patient .</detailed_description>
