	<brief_summary>Platelets play central part homeostasis thrombosis primary effector cell , also key cell regulation immunological response various stressor . After activation , platelet release granule store different inflammatory mediator induce coagulation , recruit platelet , activate complement , attract neutrophils leukocyte regulate vascular tone . Platelets activate systemic inflammation infection , may also contribute development multiple organ failure . Thus , inhibition platelet activation may beneficial effect critically ill patient . investigator hypothesize acetylsalicylic acid reduces mortality medical intensive care unit patient . In retrospective study acetylsalicylic acid use associate substantial reduction medical intensive care unit population ( Winning et al. , 2010 ) . The investigator conduct randomize , double-blind study include 460 patient ( 2x230 ) , randomize receive 100mg acetylsalicylic acid ( daily , intravenous ) placebo ( 0,9 % sodium-choride solution ) ass whether acetylsalicylic acid reduces mortality medical intensive care unit patient . Main outcome criterion 28/90day-mortality . Furthermore investigator assess whether acetylsalicylic acid reduces risk suffer thromboembolic complication . Post-mortem examination conduct patient die course study . Furthermore assess bleeding rate , intensive care unit mortality pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property acetylsalicylic acid intensive care unit population .</brief_summary>
