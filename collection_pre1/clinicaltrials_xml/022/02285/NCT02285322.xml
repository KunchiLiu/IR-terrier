	<brief_title>Predictors Blood Pressure Control Associations With Cardiovascular Diseases Individuals With High Blood Pressure : CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increment 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure ( approximately equivalent 10 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ) associate two-fold increase risk fatal stroke , two-fold increase fatal ischemic heart diseases individual age 40-69 year . The management control high blood pressure therefore one important component primary secondary strategy prevention cardiovascular mortality morbidity . Current guideline clinical management hypertension adult recommend achieve maintain blood pressure level &lt; 140/90 mmHg . However , uncertain proportion individual identify high blood pressure primary care actually reach blood pressure control , factor associate attainment control extent blood pressure control attainment associate cardiovascular disease contemporary population individual diagnose high blood pressure . This important clinician policy decision maker order design implement effective strategy patient management . The aim study investigate extent patient achieve blood pressure control associate risk factor , time attainment blood pressure control whether time associate increase risk CVD onset , all-cause cardiovascular disease end-stage renal disease . The study use data CALIBER data set clinically collect electronic health record data England . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( Clinical Practice Research Datalink - CPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER data set ) .</detailed_description>
