	<brief_summary>The rare histiocytic disorder ( RHDs ) characterize infiltration one organs non-LCH histiocyte . They range localized disease resolve spontaneously , progressive disseminate form sometimes life-threatening . Since extremely rare , limited understanding cause best treatment option . Physicians , patient parent child RHDs frequently consult member Histiocyte Society regard best management disorder . Very often , specific recommendation make due lack prospective outcome data , even large retrospective case series . The creation international rare histiocytic disorder registry ( IRHDR ) could facilitate uniform diagnosis RHDs , well collection analysis clinical , epidemiological , treatment survival data patient RHD . The registry may also lead future therapeutic recommendation , provide framework future clinical trial create excellent research opportunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Histiocytoses rare disease cause excess cell call Histiocytes , infiltrate skin , bone , lung , liver , spleen central nervous system . These disorder range localized involvement resolve spontaneously , progressive disseminate form debilitate sometimes life-threatening . The rare histiocytic disorder ( RHD ) , non-Langerhans cell disorder , diverse group disorder define accumulation histiocyte meet criterion Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH ) hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) . They include : Juvenile xanthogranuloma family , Erdheim-Chester disease , Multifocal Reticulohistiocytosis , Rosai-Dorfman disease Malignant Histiocytoses . Since rare , limit understanding cause treatment . Physicians , patient parent child rare histiocytoses frequently consult member Histiocyte Society management disorder . Very often , specific recommendation treatment make due lack prospective outcome data rare entity . The creation International Rare Histiocytic Disorders Rregistry ( IRHDR ) facilitate uniform diagnosis RHD 's , well collection analysis clinical , epidemiological , treatment survival data patient RHD . The registry also provide expert pathology review may lead future therapeutic recommendation . Furthermore , IRHDR provide framework future clinical trial , thus , create excellent research opportunity . Lastly , de-identified link clinical data companion biology study potentially accomplished future IRHDR . This may help understand etiology rare disease , well identify potential therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
