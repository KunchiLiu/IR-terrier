	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Arginase 1 ( rhArg1 ) Patients With Advanced Arginine Auxotrophic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , single site , open label non-randomized study evaluate safety PEG-BCT-100 . Patient enrollment sample size follow classical 3 + 3 dose-escalation design . The study enroll maximum 36 patient . Cohorts 3 patient receive initial single dose PEG-BCT-100 begin 0.5 mg/kg . Single dose safety parameter include hematology chemistry laboratory profile monitor 3 week . Patients demonstrate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) follow single dose may receive two additional dos PEG-BCT-100 dose level Day 22 Day 29 . After 2 additional dos , patient undergo full tumor safety assessment Day 29 . Patients whose cancer stable responding may receive weekly dos PEG-BCT- 100 disease progression . Dose escalation plan next cohort 3 patient , enrol Day 22 previous cohort , assume single dose DLTs report . Each cohort 3 patient may begin weekly administration DLTs Day 22 , previous low dose cohort successfully pass Week 4 study ( dose Days 1 , 22 + one week ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis one four advance solid tumor : HCC accord European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) criterion ( see Appendix 13.2 ) . Stage IIIb/IV malignant melanoma , stage IV Renal cell carcinoma castration resistant adenocarcinoma prostate ( CRPC ) . Advanced cancer candidate treatment modality agent approve establish efficacy . Candidates tolerate standard treatment whose cancer progress current standard care . Males females 18 yearsold . Ability understand willingness provide write informed consent ; Karnofsky performance status ( see Appendix 13.3 ) 80 % expect survival 12 week . Negative urine pregnancy test , female , willingness use effective method contraception entire study period whether patient male female . Has receive cancer treatment , e.g . chemotherapy , target biologic enzyme , either approve investigational , within 4 week prior start PEGBCT100 ; Advancing liver failure indicate uncontrolled ascites , pleural effusion , encephalopathy . ChildPugh score B C ( see Appendix 13.4 ) . Significant hepatic , renal bone marrow dysfunction indicate : total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL , evidence bile duct obstruction , serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL , serum ALT AST &gt; 2.5 x upper limit normal , serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL , ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L , platelet &lt; 100 x 109/L , INR &gt; 2.0 . Significant cardiac pulmonary disease define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV ( see Appendix 13.5 ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) low institutional normal limit echo MUGA , history myocardial infarction within past 6 month , significant unstable arrhythmia evidence ischemia ECG . Pregnant nursing woman . NOTE : Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Significant active infection include HIV require oral parenteral antiinfective therapy . Use investigational drug ( ) within 4 week enrollment . Prior treatment arginine deplete agent .</criteria>
