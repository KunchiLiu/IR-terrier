	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose research determine influence 8 week twice daily consumption 120 kcal serving dry apple commonly consume lowfat 120kcal muffin component obesity ( waist circumference [ waist measurement ] , serum glucose [ blood sugar ] , triglycerides [ fat blood ] HDL-cholesterol , blood pressure ) well antioxidant status , inflammatory marker , nutrient intake overweight obese individual . A total 48 child age 12-15 year randomly assign group provide twice daily 120 kcal serving either dried apple muffins 8 week feed . Prior initiate feed trial 8 week , blood sample collect analyzed . During visit lab , subject weigh minimal clothing , test body composition use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , bioelectrical impedance ( BIA ) air displacement plethysmography ( Bod Pod ) blood pressure , measure waist circumference . One 24-hour recall perform prior initiation study ; one recall perform throughout feed period , one end 8 week . Dietary intake energy , macronutrients , vitamin mineral assess determine diet quality . All food record analyze use Nutritionist Pro ( First DataBank ) software . The potential benefit study include determine effect consistent snack particular snack food metabolism weight management . There major risk subject study . There minimal risk perform venipuncture ( blood draw ) include bruising , perforation vein lead hematoma skin , light-headedness dizziness due fear needle , infection . This study hopefully allow understand insight diet child effect body makeup blood sugar . It hypothesize twice day apple snack group decrease waist circumference , body adiposity , triglyceride total cholesterol well , increase blood glucose uptake end 8 week .</brief_summary>
