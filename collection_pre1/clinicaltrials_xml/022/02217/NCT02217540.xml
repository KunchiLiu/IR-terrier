	<brief_summary>Objective : To pilot method propose conduct full randomise clinical trial evaluate effect Mulligan concept mobilization movement shoulder functionality old adult shoulder dysfunction . Design : Pilot randomise , single-blinded clinical trial . Setting : Three nursing home , Toledo , Spain . Participants : 44 old adult shoulder dysfunction . Interventions : Participants randomly allocate control group ( n=22 ) treat physiotherapy standard protocol propose Spanish Rheumatology Society ; experimental group ( n=22 ) treat physical therapy standard protocol Mulligan concept mobilisation movement . Both intervention take place three time week 2 consecutive week . Main outcome : Primary outcome shoulder functionality measure Shoulder Disability Questionnaire ( S-SDQ ) Spanish version , secondary outcome active glenohumeral range motion pain intensity . Data collect baseline , group intervention , 1 3 month finishing intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mulligan Concept Mobilisation With Movement Shoulder Dysfunction Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder dysfunction common problem older adult reach 21 % prevalence . Shoulder symptom , pain reduce shoulder active range motion ( AROM ) function , might associate chronic pain , disability decline physical performance time . Upper limbs shoulder joint proper functionality lead adequate independence activity daily live ( ADL ) functional performance . Therefore , maintain independence ADL functional well-being older adult priority target health care . A successful therapeutic approach depend understanding age process responsible major change involve muscle disorder joint stiffness . Among common approach treat in¬dividuals shoulder dysfunction , physiotherapy interven¬tion often recommend first choice conservative treatment . Physiotherapy treatment usually include therapeutic exercise , manual therapy , various modality controversy effective approach pain reduc¬tion , increase AROM function , decrease disability people shoulder dysfunction . There evidence effectiveness thera¬peutic exercise , benefit manual therapy improvement mobility trend improve pain measure , increase function quality life still questionable . Some evidence find effect therapeutic exercise program overall performance improvement old adult , specifically shoulder dysfunction . Regarding manual therapy elderly , Knebl et al . develop study effectiveness Spencer manipulative technique shoulder pain find improvement functionality , shoulder AROM pain intensity . Van den Dolder et al . investigated effect soft tissue massage shoulder ROM , pain dysfunction patient mean age 64 year old find statistically significant result . Therefore , manual therapy technique may option correct joint mechanic , promote adhesion removal restore passive shoulder mobility old adult . Mobilisation movement ( MWM ) manual therapy technique base analysis correction minor positional fault joint . According Mulligan , positional fault due various soft tissue and/or bone lesion in/around joint explain patient shoulder pain kinematic study . This technique aim realign joint positional fault apply manually specific orient glide painful joint , assess adjust force intensity , patient actively perform joint movement , patient 's symptom immediately relieve maneuver improve pain movement . Therefore , correction mobilization sustain , pain-free movement restore several repetition perform order get improvement last time . The initial effect MWM assess Teys et al . adult ; prove effectiveness increase shoulder AROM decrease positional fault . Therefore , MWM may effective technique physiotherapy treatment shoulder dysfunction , address passive active shoulder structure . However , study MWM effectiveness shoulder dysfunction old adult find . The purpose pilot clinical trial pilot method propose conduct full randomise controlled clinical trial determine effect Mulligan concept MWM shoulder dysfunction old adult . The primary objective evaluate feasibility recruitment , randomisation , retention , assessment procedure , implementation Mulligan concept MWM intervention . A secondary aim undertake preliminary comparison patient reported-outcomes estimate variability outcomes old adult shoulder dysfunction .</detailed_description>
