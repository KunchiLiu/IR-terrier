	<brief_title>Phenelzine Sulfate Treating Patients With Non-metastatic Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess proportion patient biochemical recurrent prostate cancer ( BCR-PC ) treat phenelzine ( phenelzine sulfate ) achieve prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline &gt; = 50 % baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To monitor potential toxicity and/or beneficial effect quality life phenelzine prostate cancer patient . II . To assess time radiographic disease progression patient recurrent prostate cancer treat phenelzine . III . To collect blood sample study relationship MAO activity prostate cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive phenelzine sulfate mouth ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment continue 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
