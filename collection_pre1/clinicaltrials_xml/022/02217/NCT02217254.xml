	<brief_summary>It unproven assumption least 2 cryoablations necessary pulmonary vein successful ablation atrial fibrillation . The investigator hypothesize single cryoablation pulmonary vein achieve isolation may lead equivalent efficacy decrease risk . The One Freeze Study evaluate hypothesis . This study compare one 3-minute cryoablation per pulmonary vein versus two 3-minute cryoablations per pulmonary vein atrial fibrillation ablation procedure .</brief_summary>
