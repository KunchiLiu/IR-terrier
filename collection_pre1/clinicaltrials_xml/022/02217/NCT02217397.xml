	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) situation repetitive upper airway obstruction sleep . For patient severe OSA , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy standard therapy , especially daytime sleepiness cardiovascular comorbidities . Although CPAP effective OSA treatment , poor adherence due high pressure often report . Instead , oral appliance ( OA ) alternative could tolerance CPAP mild moderate OSA . Oral appliance less effective compare CPAP , OA tolerable acceptable OSA patient . Only one observation study address effect combination OA CPAP OSA patient . The pilot study display combination therapy CPAP OA effective OSA patient could decrease CPAP pressure . However , study enrol patient CPAP intolerance accord subjective chief complaint , objective CPAP pressure data . In present study , study effect combination CPAP OA patient severe OSA could tolerate CPAP high-pressure setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combinations Oral Appliance CPAP Patients With Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Untolerate High-pressure CPAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study tertiary teaching hospital , National Taiwan University Hospital . Patients eligible age ≧ 20 year old , severe OSA [ apnea-hyponea index ( AHI ) &gt; = 30/hr ] could tolerate CPAP pressure &gt; 15 cmH2O , determine manual titration ( first titration ) willing use OA . The study design find patient severe OSA ( AHI &gt; = 30/hr ) . With first titration , investigator exclude severe OSA patient use CPAP ( CPAP pressure &lt; 15 cmH2O ) could tolerate CPAP . Those patient could tolerance CPAP high pressure set start three-month oral appliance trial . Then , investigator repeat full-channel polysomnography ( PSG ) second titration residual AHI ≧ 10/hr patient OA . Therefore , patient treat combination OA CPAP three month repeat PSG . The washout period therapy two week . The total follow-up period 6 month enrol . The investigator collect demographic data medical record PSG data , include age , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , CPAP titration , AHI , total sleep time , oxygen desaturation , arousal index…et al . Our primary end point change AHI compare combination therapy , OA use . The secondary end point difference titrate CPAP pressure , BMI , blood pressure , daytime sleepiness compare combination therapy OA use . Statistics analysis Data present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Continuous variable test paired Student 's test group comparison . Statistical significance assume null hypothesis could reject p &lt; 0.05 . The investigator compare difference combination therapy , OA , baseline ANOVA , repeat measure . Statistical analysis do use SPSS 22.0 Windows .</detailed_description>
