	<detailed_description>Subjects ( approximately 500 ) initially enrol general screen population first phase , second phase colposcopy clinic population ( approximately 300 ) base referral abnormal Pap cytology conduct within 120-days order achieve statistically viable number normal woman , woman Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia ( CIN1/2 ) woman CIN3+ , describe Section 6.1 , `` Cervical Cytology Enrollment Targets '' . After Cervical Neoplasia Detection System ( CNDS ) test , sample Hybrid Capture 2 Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) test liquid cytology collect addition colposcopy biopsy , indicate . A key component effective screening study design evaluate new detection modality verification gold standard comparison estimate sensitivity specificity generate . In case screen study general study cervical disease detection particular , avoidance verification bias priority . For purpose propose study , CIN3 cancer ( CIN3+ ) must verify adjudicated multiple histopathologists . Results woman CIN1 CIN2 confirm histopathologically analyze separate subgroup lesion often regress normal certain population tend cause disagreement among histopathologists . In order verify absence disease ( i.e. , CIN1 less severe ) , investigator rely histopathology , would ethical perform multiple biopsy excisional procedure obtain tissue sample histopathology . Instead , woman consider normal negative referral cytology , free high risk HPV colposcopically normal .</detailed_description>
