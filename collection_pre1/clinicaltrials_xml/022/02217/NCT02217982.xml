	<brief_summary>Single site , open label , randomize design patient relapse form Multiple Sclerosis . At Screening Visit , patient give diary contain MAGIS scale complete day first two week Dimethyl Fumarate ( DMF ) , include titration period . After two week patient experience 3 consecutive day GI symptom category ≥3.5 , patient return Baseline Visit . The MAGIS diary review coordinator . Any patient report average MAGIS score great equal 3.5 least one key category randomize standard therapy treatment arm . Patients report MAGIS le 3.5 period terminate study visit .
