	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) complex disorder characterize disturbed body image , ego-syntonic neglect , ambivalence , self-starvation , loss body weight , obsessive thought food , ritualistic pattern food intake , elevate physical activity , depression , anxiety emotional rigidity . The evidence base treatment limit , consider extent disorder erodes quality life still carry high fatality rate psychiatric disease . In fact , evidence prognosis improve throughout 20th century . AN remain syndrome , i.e . collection symptom , define etiology . Twin study consistently demonstrate AN strongly familial predominantly due genetic factor . However , neither candidate gene genome-wide study identify truly validated gene AN . AN associated multiple , profound endocrine disturbance . However , far extensive research lead breakthrough discovery . There need new thinking . Colonization human gut begin birth bacteria mother 's vagina labor-released maternal feces . In adults human digestive tract contain complex assembly microorganisms actually outnumber number host cell 10:1 . This intestinal microbiota microbiome provide human additional gene product , may regard organ , contribute multiple host metabolic pathway . Thus , whole range substance produce yet identify . Potentially substance may affect function brain , appetite emotion regulation . Recent advance microbial DNA sequence technology result metagenomics DNA analysis whole ecosystems human gut . An important step forward investigate bacterial composition human microbiome take Metagenome Human Intestinal Tract consortium reporting first complete microbial gene atlas human distal gut , use deep next generation metagenome sequencing . AIM To investigate whether gut microbiota alter patient AN . If confirm , potentially may play role pathogenesis , promote susceptibility development and/or maintenance AN . HYPOTHESIS Patients AN harbor alter gut microbiota composition functional potential determine quantitative metagenomic analysis microbial DNA isolate stool sample sequence apply combination deep untargeted shotgun sequence . STUDY DESIGN A cross sectional multicenter study gut microbiome profile woman AN compare age match healthy , normal weight woman . SUBJECTS The patient characterize accord national guideline . The following data extract medical file include descriptive multivariate analyzes . If twin substudy II recruit non-participating unit , mention questionnaire blood sample conduct , discordant twin . Clinical variable : Gender , age , disease duration , BMI , % weight change last 4 week , in/out patient status , medication , somatic psychiatric comorbidity , smoke status . Psychometric variable : Eating Disorder Inventory ( EDI ) -3 . Control subject : The control subject match described , allocated sibling patient , local health worker , necessary , announcement official Danish website participation clinical trial . The age match woman fill 17 item health relate questionnaire . Any chronic disease , medication history psychiatric illness result exclusion participation . They , however , allow use oral contraceptive . FECAL SAMPLING Fecal sample collect order characterize composition gut microbiome . A sample 5 g collect help collection tray . Participants instruct immediately store sample freezer -18Â°C . Transportation do cold temperature isolate box contain frozen element , hand study personnel maximal 24 hour delivery store -80 C DNA extraction . MORNING FASTING URINE 5 ml morning fast urine collect . ANALYZING FOR DIFFERENCES IN GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION The feces specimen process analyzed follow : Bacterial DNA extraction , shotgun illumine DNA sequencing , microbial gene analysis , taxonomy analysis include entero type , know specie unknown meta-species ( =quantitative metagenomics ) well functional gene annotation . The storage DNA purification do Center Basic Metabolic Research ( CBMR ) . Shotgun sequence illumine technology gut microbial DNA undertaken CBMR collaboration Beijing Genomics Institute ( BGI ) Europe Copenhagen Bio Science Park ( COBIS ) , Copenhagen staff gut-microbiome-skilled bioinformaticians assure quality control read . Quantitative metagenomics outline performed unit Bioinformatics Computational Metagenomics CBMR apply establish state-of-the art methodology . BIOCHEMICAL VARIABLES Basic parameter : The following analysis perform integral part diagnosis treatment specialist unit , extract medical file : Na , K , creatinine , carbamide , bicarbonate , Ca-ion , phosphate , Hemoglobin , C-reactive protein , leukocytes , mean cell volume , mean cell hemoglobin concentrate , alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , pancreatic amylase , Mg , Zn , thyroxine , triiodothyronine , thyrotropin , cobalamine , folate , follicle stimulate hormone , luteinizing hormone , prolactin , estradiol , vitamin D. Values adjust express ratio relative normal value basis average standard value center . SAMPLES All sample store -80 C : - Faeces 4 x 5 g. - Serum 20 x 500 microliter serum . - Plasma 20 x 500 microliter plasm . - Buffy coat x 10 . - Morning urine 2 ml . Biochemical analysis : From sample serum/plasma , follow analysis perform : Insulin , Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , IGF-1 binding protein-3 , leptin , adiponectin . BIOBANK The fecal sample mention material store biobank 30 year . If microbiome genotype AN disclose , genomic analysis , mass spectroscopy metabolites maybe inoculation study perform ( follow new application Ethical Committee ) . STATISTICS Power calculation . There data available regard microbiota AN . The number participant substudy I base ongoing study gut microbiome pregnant woman patient multiple sclerosis population size 50 estimate appropriate provide power great 80 % significance 5 % observe difference present quantitative metagenomics approach . Multivariate analyze . Statistical method build upon previously develop method multivariate statistical approach apply within Metagenomics Human Intestinal Tract ( MetaHIT ) consortium . ETHICS The study approve register The Regional Scientific Ethical Committee Southern Denmark ( file 42053 S-20140040 ) . The participant ask whether willing donate material Biobank . A total 100 ml blood 5 g feces subsequently store late analysis , use related future study , approval first obtain Scientific Ethical Committee . The biobank sample store 30 year . Clinical , psychometric biochemical variable mention extract medical file . Patients three participate centre receive invitation information meet one health worker , one local investigator . For subject age 18 year ( 15 - 18 ) one parent must participate must provide write informed consent . Subjects age 18 year allow bring friend family member observer . It emphasize voluntary participate . During information meeting official document publish The National Committee Health Research Ethics 2012 hand . The invitation sibling motivate fact future study biobank material prove particular interest , high level genetic relatedness test patient control subject . However , patient inclusion present project depend whether sibling wish participate . Recruitment patient age 15 motivate fact high prevalence AN age group . The old patient , great likelihood psychiatric co-morbidity . It therefore important validity result age spectrum also cover 15 - 18 year age . HANDLING AND ARCHIVING DATA The current protocol approve The Danish Data Protection Agency ( case file 1429534 , 2008-58-035 ) document material related clinical study store accord Act Processing Personal Data . All sensitive information personal , physical biological origin relate individual participant treat confidentially accord Danish legislation . FINANCE This non-profit study , completely independent commercial interest . There applied public private grant finance study . PERSPECTIVES If present study identifies alter gut flora AN , provide basis several important new study gen product face blood AN , also inoculation experiment gnotobiotic mouse . Clarifying whether intestinal flora implicate susceptibility maintenance AN may provide basis development new highly required treatment AN potentially also obesity .</detailed_description>
