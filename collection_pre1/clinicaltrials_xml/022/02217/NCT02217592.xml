	<criteria>Males females 18 year old Thai nationality Required hospitalization decide attend physician Documented attend physician infection primary cause illness lead hospitalization . These infection due pathogen ( bacteria , virus , fungi parasite ) Presence 3 follow Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) Fever hypothermia ( Core body temperature define &gt; 38.3 C &lt; 36.0 C ) Tachycardia ( heart rate &gt; 90 beat per minute ) Tachypnea ( respiratory rate &gt; 20 per minute ) Arterial hypotension ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 90 mmHg , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) &lt; 70 mmHg , SBP decrease &gt; 40 mmHg ) White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 12,000/µL &lt; 4000/µL immature form &gt; 10 % Platelet count &lt; 100,000/microlitre Altered mental status Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) &lt; 15 Hypoxemia ( Pulse Oximetry Level &lt; 95 ) Ileus Significant edema positive fluid balance Decreased capillary refill mottle Hyperglycemia ( plasma glucose &gt; 140 mg/dL ) absence diabetes Plasma Creactive protein &gt; 2 SD normal value Plasma procalcitonin &gt; 2 SD normal value Arterial hypoxemia ( PaO2 / FIO2 &lt; 300 ) Acute oliguria ( urine output &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/hr 45 mmol/L 2 hour ) Creatinine increase &gt; 0.5 mg/dL INR &gt; 1.5 aPTT &gt; 60 second Plasma total bilirubin &gt; 4 mg/dl 70 mmol/L Hyperlactatemia ( &gt; 1 mmol/L ) Exclusion Criteria Infection suspect primary cause current illness episode lead hospitalization . For example , communityacquired sepsis severe sepsis consider due stroke , cardiovascular disease , acute myocardial infarction , cancer , burn , injury , trauma Hospitalized study site current episode 24 hour enrollment Hospitalized current episode 72 hour another primary/referring hospital Prior current episode , patient admit hospital within last 30 day Prior enrolment , document attend physician hospital acquire infection associate cause sepsis severe sepsis Please note follow condition exclusion criterion , patient follow condition enrol study Confirmed diagnosis method infection major cause illnesses leading hospitalization . For example , patient already definite diagnosis malarial infection blood smear Clinical diagnosis specific disease specific syndromes acute infective diarrhea , acute pneumonia , acute encephalomyelitis acute myocarditis Suspected infectious noninfectious disease infectious disease primary cause illness ( primary diagnosis ) lead hospitalization . For example , acute pneumonia stroke underlying disease , etc Patients admit hospital refer study site . For example refer patient admit first hospital le 48 hour prior enrollment Patients fulfil inclusion criterion without result complete blood count result parameter inclusion criterion . For example , patient hypothermia , tachycardia tachypnea complete criterion SIRS even without result complete blood count result parameter INR , plasma procalcitonin</criteria>
