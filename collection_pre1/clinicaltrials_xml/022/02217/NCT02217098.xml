	<brief_summary>The null hypothesis study GCC , GIC compomer survival rate use treatment occlusal proximal caries primary molar ART field condition . This research do field condition Barueri , city state São Paulo , Brazil . A total 600 patient select . After 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month restoration teeth evaluate two independent evaluator . Only child whose parent representative sign informed consent include research.The ART treatment do two dental student . The operator receive ART-training . The child randomly assign one operator . The restorative material use child assign another random list . It perform descriptive analysis describe sample . Bivariate analyse perform test hypothesis . The data analyze chi-square test compare survival rate GIC GCC . Some co-variables evaluate , : operator effect , influence cavity size survival rate , position tooth , dentist prefer side , child 's dmft/DMFT , contamination finally preoperative condition . The effect variables survival rate evaluate use regression analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The null hypothesis study GCC , GIC compomer survival rate use treatment occlusal proximal caries primary molar ART field condition . This research do field condition Barueri , city state São Paulo , Brazil . A total 600 patient select , 300 patient one occlusal carie lesion 300 different patient occlusal proximal cavity . After 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month restoration teeth evaluate two independent evaluator . Only child whose parent representative sign informed consent include research . Only one restoration per child include study . If carious lesion present , one randomly select research . The remain carious lesion also treat . The ART treatment do two dental student . The operator receive ART-training . The child randomly assign one operator . The restorative material use child assign another random list . The selected child occlusal ( O ) cavity occlusalproximal ( OP ) cavity . So , stratum study OP O . So , one randomization list perform occlusal cavity another randomization list use occlusal proximal cavity . It perform descriptive analysis describe sample . Bivariate analyse perform test hypothesis . The data analyze chi-square test compare survival rate GIC GCC . Some co-variables evaluate , : operator effect , influence cavity size survival rate , position tooth , dentist prefer side , child 's dmft/DMFT , contamination finally preoperative condition . The effect variables survival rate evaluate use regression analysis .</detailed_description>
