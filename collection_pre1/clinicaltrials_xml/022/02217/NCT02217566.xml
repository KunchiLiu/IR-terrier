	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy , base prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression , abiraterone acetate participant metastatic ( spread cancer cell one part body another ) castration ( action , surgical , chemical , otherwise , male loses function testis ) resistant prostate cancer ( cancer prostrate ; gland make fluid aid movement sperm ) ( mCRPC ) , chemo-naive ( treatment cancer do use drug ) , receive prior diethylstilbestrol therapy ( DES ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Abiraterone Acetate Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) , Chemo-Naive , Who Received Prior Diethylstilbestrol Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multinational ( medical research study take place one country ) , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single arm study determine benefit abiraterone acetate low-dose prednisone androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) mCRPC participant fail prior DES therapy . The study consist Screening Phase 28 day enrollment ; PSA Evaluation Phase ; Follow-up Phase 24 month . Each cycle abiraterone therapy 28 day . Participants receive 1000 milligram ( mg ) abiraterone acetate orally daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally daily plus stable regimen ADT ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [ LHRH ] agonist ) per Investigator 's discretion . Treatment continue PSA progression , clinical progression , consent withdrawal , occurrence unacceptable toxicity . Efficacy primarily assess time PSA progression . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
