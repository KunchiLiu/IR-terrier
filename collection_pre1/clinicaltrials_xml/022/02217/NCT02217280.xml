	<brief_summary>This study analyze injectate dispersal pattern standard-of-care cervical epidural steroid injection use gadolinium marker magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) characterize pattern . Although procedure perform high frequency assumption injectate remain localized injection site , peer-reviewed study validate assumption . Comprehensive characterization injectate dispersal pattern provide important data regard safety , well diagnostic therapeutic potential cervical epidural steroid injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidural steroid injection long impact treatment various spine-related condition , particularly radiculopathy . The efficacy epidural spinal injection attribute anatomic location reach injectate . Cervical epidural steroid injection also use injury location indicator . This application base document pain relief injection specific location cervical spine . Both diagnostic therapeutic application epidural assume injectate remain local injection site order effect . However , recently complete study , investigator group document substantial diffusion injectate lumbar epidural use computerized tomography ( CT ) assessments.1 Based exposure ionize radiation associate CT along superior image specificity sensitivity MRI , investigator shift image modality MRI future study . The propose study design evaluate use gadolinium MRI ass nature amount diffusion injectate cervical region standard-of-care epidural injection . To investigator knowledge , first study critically assess common procedure order evaluate safety efficacy clinical setting .</detailed_description>
