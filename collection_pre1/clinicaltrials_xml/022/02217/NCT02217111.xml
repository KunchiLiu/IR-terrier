	<detailed_description>- Voice disorder common communication disorder across lifespan , affect 5 million school-aged child annually United States . - Vocal fold nodule frequent pathology affect voice child , may affect 21 % pediatric population give point time . - Children voice disorder cause condition often experience negative consequence quality life academic participation . - Specifically , child increase risk inferior school performance , dysfunctional psychosocial development , negative sequela . - Overwhelmingly , first-line treatment voice problem due nodule behavioral voice therapy . - Unfortunately , pediatric population badly underserved Speech-Language Pathology condition others affect voice . - Moreover , date , experimental finding benefit voice therapy child report . - In present study , child present voice complaint Department Otolaryngology Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh ( CHP ) , diagnose vocal fold nodule , follow informed consent find satisfy inclusion criterion detail shortly , eligible participation study . - Eligible child undergo 45-60-min battery standardized test evaluate simple cognitive function . - Participation protocol depend outcome test . - Then , child receive increasingly use , 9-week program voice therapy child vocal fold nodule condition affect voice , `` Adventures Voice , '' program ground basic biomechanical , biological , cognitive science . - Dependent variable pre- post-therapy change voice-related quality-of-life , base Pediatric Voice-Related Quality Life Survey ( Boseley , Cunningham , Volk , &amp; Hartnick , 2006 ) ( primary outcome measure ) change series standard acoustic aerodynamic measure base sustain vowel simple run speech sample , describe shortly ( secondary outcome measure ) . - The independent variable involve series cognitive measure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Diagnosis vocal fold nodule . Age 411 yr . Informed Consent . English comprehension production sufficient participate protocol voice therapy . Considered behaviorally cognitively appropriate ear , nose , throat physician speechlanguage pathologist voice therapy . Parent child willingness participate aspect protocol voice therapy . Comorbid medical condition medication would mask amplify outcome voice therapy , include ( ) developmental neuromuscular condition , ( b ) major illness , chronic acute , exception laryngopharyngeal reflux disease ( LPR ) allergies treatment , common child adults voice disorder , thus exclusion would severely restrict participant pool , moreover , threaten external validity . Hearing loss : &gt; 20 dB hearing loss 1000 , 2000 , 4000 Hz least one ear .</criteria>
