	<detailed_description>Background Purpose : Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral entrapment neuropathy . Although many conservative form management include use wrist splint , steroid injection therapeutic ultrasound applicable , effectiveness typically insignificant short-lived . Pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF ) treatment , relative novel pain intervention recent decade , find able alleviate pain certain kind chronic pain condition without damage nerve . However , application PRF CTS scarce . The purpose study assess analgesic effect prognosis ultrasound-guided PRF median nerve patient CTS . Study design Duration : 2012/1/1 2012/12/31 . Subjects : Outpatient subject typical symptom sign CTS , positive Tinel 's sign Phalen 's test numbness/tingling least two first , second , third digit confirm electrophysiological study , consider enrol . The patient condition mimic CTS , cervical radiculopathy , polyneuropathy , brachial plexopathy , thoracic outlet syndrome previous wrist surgery steroid injection CTS , exclude . Patient number : 40 . Methods : The enrolled patient randomize two group intervention group , receive one dose PRF control group , receive RPF treatment use draw seal envelope . To provide fundamental medical care CTS , wrist night splint prescribe subject group . Patients order wear splint rest night least 8 hour per day period study . All procedure conduct single physician . All measurement perform single physician blind randomization , evaluation time perform intervention well 1st , 4th , 8th 12th week treatment . All patient instruct keep away get treatment pain discomfort result CTS include analgesic agent , injection acupuncture etc . period follow-up . They ask notify u take therapy . Outcome measurement : 1 . Visual analog scale ( VAS ) : The severity digital pain activity time per day mark pain scale . Each patient report VAS score every day time initial treatment 2 consecutive day reach definition onset time define day VAS score decline 40 % . 2 . Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) . 3 . Cross-sectional area median nerve : It measure proximal inlet carpal tunnel ( level pisiform bone ) physician . 4 . Sensory nerve conduction velocity ( SNCV ) median nerve . 5 . Finger pinch . Data analysis : Demographic data analyze Mann-Whitney U test continuous data X2 test categorical data . Wilcoxon 's signed rank test use compare outcome measure within group patient . The outcomes follow-up period compare baseline value difference group investigate use Mann-Whitney U test . Comparability change VAS score finger pinch measurement among two group assess use Mann-Whitney U test . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
