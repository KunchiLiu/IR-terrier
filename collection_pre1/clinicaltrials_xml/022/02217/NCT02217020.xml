	<brief_summary>The standard treatment stage 2/3 rectal cancer neoadjuvant 5-Fu base chemoradiation . However , preoperative radiation cause kinds adverse event , irreversible . And survival benefit obvious . Whether chemotherapy alone effective enough treating rectal cancer yet know . Here , investigator choose three active cytotoxic agent ( 5-FU , Oxaliplatin , Irinotecan ) neoadjuvant treatment regimen ( FOLFOXIRI ) . The purpose study evaluate efficacy FOLFOXIRI neoadjuvant regimen treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI Chemotherapy Alone Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy could improve local control locally advanced rectal cancer , role limit , 5 % . The adverse event cause radiotherapy severe . This single phase II trial aim evaluate efficacy triplet regimen ( FOLFOXIRI ) treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer . All patient receive study regimen every 2 week 4-6 cycle . MRI pelvic perform 4 cycle chemotherapy assess clinical response . If tumor response 20 % 4 cycle treatment , patient go surgery ( TME ) directly 2 cycle treatment surgery decision MDT . On contrary , tumor show poor response ( &lt; 20 % ) , radiotherapy perform operation . After surgery , 6-8 cycle mFOLFOX6 give adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
