	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Alerting Extended Hypotensive Exposures Long-Term Outcome After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : We recently identify significant association postoperative morbidity 30-day mortality concept `` hypotensive exposure '' anaesthesia . Specifically , find approximately 160,000 patient 3 institution ( Cleveland Clinic , Vanderbilt University Saint Louis University ) roughly every third adult patient undergoing non-cardiac procedure anaesthesia experience twice 30-day all-cause mortality portend extend cumulative period less normal intraoperative blood pressure . This association independent co-morbidity ( Charlson Co-morbidity index ) , cause relative increase mortality `` healthy '' `` sick '' patient . A new method introduce quantify hypotensive exposure form novel risk score call SLUScore™ , score value range 0 ( hypotensive exposure ) maximum 31 ( maximal number exposure exceed certain risk-based set limit time accumulate mean arterial blood pressure thresholds 75 45 mm Hg ) , increment SLUScore™ portend equivalent 5 % increase 30-day postoperative mortality . Hypothesis : We test hypothesis alert anaesthesia care team progressive hypotensive exposure ( progressive increase SLUScore™ ) improve 30-day survival . This tested prospective , randomised trial . Methods Design : A novel Clinical Decision Support System ( ACG-Anesthesia Talis Clinical , LLC ) use alert anaesthesia care team member patient ' SLUScores™ near real time ( within 1 minute document exposure ) . At time transition SLUScore™ 0 1 ( occur approximately every third anaesthetic ) , patient automatically randomize ACG-Anesthesia system either alert alert ( blind ) status intent raise awareness part anaesthesia care team alert group occurrence extend hypotensive exposure associate risk , allow team render best clinical judgment initiate intervention aim bring patient progressive hypotensive state . With one interim analysis plan two year , total 56,248 patient project enrolled 4-year period trial power detect 0.3 % absolute reduction 30-day mortality , save least 50 life alert group two year ( two-sided p &lt; 0.016 ) least 70 life ( two-sided p &lt; 0.019 ) conclusion trial .</detailed_description>
