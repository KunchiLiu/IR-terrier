	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) major health concern general Veteran population . Indeed , prevalence CKD large Veteran population 20 % . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) significantly increase CKD important cause morbidity mortality . As much 80 % CVD associate vascular dysfunction , particularly impaired endothelium-dependent dilation ( EDD ) , measure brachial artery flow-mediate dilation ( FMD ) , stiffen large elastic artery , measure aortic pulse-wave velocity ( aPWV ) . Not surprisingly , patient CKD demonstrate dysfunctional vascular phenotype . Even early stage CKD , increase oxidative stress result structural functional vascular change , , turn , contribute vascular dysfunction ( impaired EDD large elastic artery stiffening ) . In CKD , phosphorus remain within normal range ( 2.5-4.5 mg/dL ) late disease . However , elevate serum phosphorus , even within normal range , associate impaired EDD indirect measure arterial stiffness . Whether lower serum phosphorus patient CKD improve EDD arterial stiffness unknown . This study randomized-controlled trial lanthanum carbonate , non-calcium base phosphate binder , treat vascular dysfunction . The efficacy phosphate bind lanthanum carbonate treat vascular endothelial dysfunction large elastic artery stiffness patient stage IIIb IV CKD ( estimate glomerular filtration rate 15-45 mL/min/1.73m2 ) baseline serum phosphorus 2.8-5.5 mg/dL assess . The study also determine lower serum phosphorus lanthanum carbonate also reduce circulate endothelial cell marker oxidative stress . This study could shift clinical practice guideline establish novel therapy reduce CVD risk CKD patient require chronic hemodialysis . [ COMIRB 13-0328 ] Little known phosphorus balance CKD . It assume CKD patient remain neutral phosphorus balance despite decrease kidney function . Serum phosphorus remain normal range late CKD thus make difficult recognize perturbation phosphorus balance . Indeed , among CKD patient treat non-calcium contain phosphate binder , sevelamer , serum phosphorus change six week treatment urinary phosphate excretion , parathyroid hormone , fibroblast growth factor-23 change significantly , suggest shift phosphorus homeostasis . However , two study find patient CKD III-IV treat calcium-containing phosphate binder remain neutral phosphorus balance . There study evaluate effect non-calcium base phosphate binder phosphorus balance among patient CKD study examine effect change phosphorus balance vascular function . An extension above-described 12-week prospective randomize , placebo-controlled double-blind trial ( COMIRB 13-0328 ) conduct subset subject . A total 24 subject COMIRB 13-0328 recruit participate Phosphorus Balance sub-investigation ( 12 subject treat lanthanum carbonate 12 subject treat placebo ) . [ 15-0384 ] They consume diet fix phosphorus content ( 1000 +/- 50 mg ) seven day . They admit inpatient Center Translational Clinical Research University Colorado Denver 48 hour accurately collect urine stool sample . The goal Phosphorus Balance sub-investigation ( COMIRB 15-0384 ) determine whether lower serum phosphorus , accomplish parent phosphorus lower randomized-controlled trial ( COMIRB 13-0328 ) , affect phosphorus balance compare subject treat placebo . A key secondary goal determine difference phosphorus balance affect vascular function measure FMD . [ 15-0384 ]</detailed_description>
