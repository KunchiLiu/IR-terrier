	<brief_summary>Background . Early rehabilitation program ( ERP ) include physical , occupational , speech therapy lessen debilitation promotes return previous physical cognitive function successfully apply adult intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . Despite fact critically ill child acute brain injury ( ABI ) increase risk life-long disability stunt development , benefit ERP group study standard care pediatric ICUs . Objectives . The aim study 1 ) To good understand current practice barrier use therapy 2 ) To subsequently evaluate ERP vs. usual care child ABI ICU randomize child group measure outcomes . We expect ERP therapy underutilized PICU outcome ERP group superior compare usual care group . Methods . The first task research program survey healthcare professional ( physician , nurse , ally health ) family child ICU hospital 's resource , current practice , barrier ERP . This survey distribute 78 site affiliate Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Sepsis Investigators ( PALISI ) , group clinicians researcher dedicate improve child outcomes critical illness . Next , enroll 175 child ABI randomize , control trial ERP versus usual care . Children enrol ERP begin therapy 48 hour ICU admission usual care group begin therapy service order treat physician . Children age 3-17 year ABI expect admitted ICU &gt; 48 hour due trauma , infection , low oxygen , low blood flow brain eligible . Therapy intervention individualize child 's clinical status . The effectiveness ERP measure use Vineland Behavior Adaptive Scale ( VABS ) pre-ABI 6 month post-ABI . This test , validate child , assess child 's physical cognitive function well behavior . Other test perform ass child family quality life length hospital admission . Our outcome test choose 1 ) They important outcome family child survey ICU 2 ) They outcomes influenced ERP . Summary . This first large study design evaluate whether ERP improve outcome critically ill child ABI . We anticipate rehabilitation practice ICUs unprotocolized under-utilized . We expect patient ERP group superior adaptive quality life outcome , outcome important family , without increase adverse event compare patient usual care group .</brief_summary>
