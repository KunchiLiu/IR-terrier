	<brief_summary>Local anesthesia commonly use reduce pain joint injection , particularly deep joint like hip . Lidocaine commonly use local anesthetic medical practice . It well know lidocaine infiltration painful . Many strategy study minimize pain associate lidocaine administration , include buffering , warm , slow infiltration rate . Bacteriostatic saline ( BS ) alternative local anesthetic show less painful injected subcutaneous tissue compare lidocaine . However , BS use widely implement local anesthesia , study context joint injection . The purpose study compare infiltration pain anesthetic efficacy lidocaine BS ultrasound ( US ) guide intraarticular hip injection .</brief_summary>
