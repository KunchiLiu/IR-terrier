	<brief_summary>Purpose : The incidence stroke low-to-middle income country increase .Balance impairment fall negatively impact function stroke patient . Mobility base successful postural control 30 % individual stroke unable ambulate without assistance.Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) new promise tool motor recovery neurological disease.This address tDCS intervention . Objective : The objective study examine efficacy anodal tDCS combine Biodex balance train postural control chronic stroke patient use laboratory clinical assessment . The following essential treatment component ; ) active tDCS stimulation pair Biodex balance training , b ) sham tDCS pair Biodex balance training program . To identify combination effect tDCS stimulation plus balance training . Hypothesis : Anodal tDCS target leg motor area ( CZ ) 5-days plus Biodex balance training , significantly improve stroke client ' balance functional mobility . Double blind sham -controlled randomized tDCS stimulation Arms Assigned Interventions Experimental : Arm 1 tDCS brain stimulation simultaneous balance training Participants underwent Active tDCS brain stimulation ( 20 minute ) simultaneous balance training ( 20 minute ) 5 consecutive day . No Intervention : Arm 2 Sham tDCS brain stimulation ( 20 minute ) simultaneous balance training</brief_summary>
