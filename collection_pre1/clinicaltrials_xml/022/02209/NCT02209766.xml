	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single-centre study plan enrol 3 cohort 3 study arm ( Study Arms A , B C ) . Study Arms A B comprised cohort healthy male Japanese subject randomise , single-blind , placebo-controlled , single multiple dose parallel study Study Arm C comprise cohort healthy male Caucasian subject single multiple dose open-label study . Two dose level , 2 4 g D5884 , investigate healthy male Japanese subject . Up 18 healthy male Japanese subject age 20 45 year , inclusive , enrol 2 cohort ( Study Arms A B ) 6 healthy male Caucasian subject enrol 3rd cohort ( Study Arm C ) . Each subject participate 1 cohort . Following screening period maximum 42 day , subject reside study facility 18 night start day dose ( Day -1 ) Day 18 ( day discharge ) . The follow-up period dose 8 ( ±2 ) day last dose . Dose administration 3 study arm do follow sequence : single dose D5884 placebo administer ; follow 2-day washout period ; washout period , multiple dos D5884 placebo administer , daily 14 consecutive day . The 1st cohort ( Study Arm A ) receive 2 g D5884 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=3 ) , 2nd cohort ( Study Arm B ) receive 4 g D5884 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=3 ) 3rd cohort ( Study Arm C ) receive 4 g D5884 ( n=6 ) . The PK analysis include evaluable PK data appropriate evaluation interest ( eg , major protocol deviation violation think significantly affect PK drug ) subject receive D5884 .</detailed_description>
