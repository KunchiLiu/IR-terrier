	<criteria>Pathological criterion : Glioblastoma ( GBM ) histologically confirm pathology review surgically resect tissue . Tumor cell resect tissue must available EGFRvIII testing . Patients previously treat EGFRvIIItargeted therapy recur , must tumor sample obtain recurrence available EGFRvIII testing . Age great 18 year . If patient dexamethasone , anticipate dose must 4 mg/day less least 5 day prior apheresis . ECOG performance status 0 1 Documented negative serum HCG female patient childbearing potential . Participants adequate organ function measure : White blood count great equal 2500/mm^3 ; platelet great equal 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL ; without transfusion growth factor support AST , ALT , GGT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit , total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal Coagulation test PT PTT within normal limit , unless patient therapeutically anticoagulated previous venous thrombosis . Provide voluntary inform consent Tissue Screening Apheresis Inclusion Criteria Step 2 : 1 . Subject meet Step 1 Eligibility Criteria . 2 . Tumor cell test positive EGFRvIII expression ( RTPCR , next generation sequencing , immunohistochemistry ) CART EGFRvIII product manufacture formulated . Patients previously treat EGFRvIIItargeted therapy recur eligible tumor sample obtain recurrence test positive EGFRvIII . 3 . Stage disease : Cohort 1 : Patients first relapse previously diagnose primary glioblastoma . Recurrence may determine image clinical criterion alone . Cohort 2 : Patients newly diagnose glioblastoma le 95 % resection great equal 1 cm^3 residual disease postoperative MRI ( typically postoperative day 1 ) . 4 . If patient dexamethasone , dose must 4 mg/day less prior CARTEGFRvIII infusion . 5 . It anticipate patient Cohort 2 complete standard care external beam radiotherapy chemotherapy temozolomide ( TMZ ) time preinfusion safety visit . 6 . Life expectancy less great 3 month 7 . ECOG performance status 0 1 9 . Participants adequate organ function measure : White blood count great equal 2500/mm^3 ; platelet great equal 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL ; without transfusion growth factor support AST , ALT , GGT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit , total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal Coagulation test PT PTT within normal limit , unless patient therapeutically anticoagulated previous venous thrombosis . Adequate cardiac function ( great EF 55 % ) 10 . Provide voluntary informed consent study treatment . 11 . Female subject reproductive potential must agree use reliable method contraception . Exclusion Criteria Step 1 : Female subject reproductive potential pregnant lactating . Female study participant reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test part Step 1 eligibility confirmation . Uncontrolled active infection . Active latent chronic hepatitis B [ detectable hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ] active hepatitis C ( positive serology [ HCV Ab ] ) infection . HIV infection . Previous treatment gene therapy product . Known addiction alcohol illicit drug . History allergy hypersensitivity study product excipients ( human serum albumin , DMSO , Dextran 40 ) Exclusion Criteria Step 2 : Female subject reproductive potential pregnant lactating . Female study participant reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within two week prior CARTEGFRvIII cell infusion . The safety therapy unborn child know . Uncontrolled active infection . Use immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine , MMF , tacrolimus , rapamycin within 4 week enrollment Step 2 . A minimal dose corticosteroid ( dexamethasone 4 mg/day ) permit . Recent current use inhale steroid exclusionary . Previous treatment gene therapy product . Subjects physicians anticipate use follow concurrent treatment medication include : a. Radiosurgery ( except Standard Care Fractionated External Radiation therapy part protocol regimen Cohort 2 ) b . Chemotherapy ( except Standard Care Temozolomide therapy Cohort 2 ) c. Interferon ( e.g . IntronAÂ® ) d. Allergy desensitization injection e. Any ongoing investigational therapeutic medication . f. Bevacizumab Participants another cancer diagnosis history visceral metastasis time preentry evaluation . The following diagnosis examples allow : squamous cell cancer skin without know metastasis basal cell cancer skin without know metastasis carcinoma situ breast ( DCIS LCIS ) carcinoma situ cervix prostate cancer PSA recurrence cancer require systemic therapy ( hormonal therapy ) past three ( 3 ) year . Any uncontrolled active medical disorder would preclude participation outline . Unstable angina and/or myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen Known addiction alcohol illicit drug . History allergy hypersensitivity study product excipients ( human serum albumin , DMSO , Dextran 40 )</criteria>
