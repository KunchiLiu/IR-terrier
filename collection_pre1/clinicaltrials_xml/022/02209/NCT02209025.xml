	<brief_summary>Rationale : Despite successful effort low atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration , substantial residual cardiovascular risk remain . An additive strategy lower residual risk may via raise high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) concentration , particular major protein constituent apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I ) . Based several study , theobromine may promise candidate respect . Recently , theobromine show increase serum HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentration 0.16 mmol/L 10 % apoA-I level 8 % . The question whether increase HDL-C apoA-I concentration observe translates improve functionality blood vessel . Effects theobromine vascular function never evaluate placebo control human intervention study . Objective : The primary objective evaluate long-term effect theobromine vascular function healthy subject slightly lower HDL-C fast postprandial state . The second primary objective evaluate long-term effect theobromine intestinal apoA-I mRNA protein expression level healthy subject slightly lower HDL-C fast postprandial state . Secondary objective study long-term effect theobromine ( 1 ) fast serum HDL-C concentration , ( 2 ) cholesterol efflux capacity ( 3 ) postprandial lipid glucose metabolism . Study design : A randomized , double-blind , placebo control cross-over design . The total study duration 12 week , consist 4 week experimental period , 4 week wash-out , 4 week control period . At end experimental control period , postprandial test take place . Study population : Forty-eight healthy men age 45-70 year woman age 50-70 year , slightly lower HDL-C concentration ( men &lt; 1.3 mmol/L woman &lt; 1.5 mmol/L ) . Intervention : During experimental period , subject consume daily breakfast drink contain 500 mg theobromine . During placebo period , subject consume daily breakfast drink without theobromine . During wash-out period , consume drink . Main study parameters/endpoints : Measurements perform end 4-week intervention period . The effect theobromine calculate absolute difference value obtain end period . The primary endpoint change vascular function define % change flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) intake daily stressor , milkshake provide three different macronutrients .

The second primary endpoint change apoA-I mRNA protein expression end period 5 hour intake milkshake . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Before study , subject screen twice determine eligibility two visit 15 minute . During visit , body weight , height blood pressure measure . In addition , venous blood sample ( 5.5 mL occasion ) drawn . During study , subject receive control theobromine drink random order . At day 1 14 fast venous blood sample ( 16.5 mL 7 mL respectively ) drawn body weight blood pressure measure . At day 25 81 fasting blood sample drawn ( 28 mL ) . In addition , day 28 experimental period , t=0 hour , fast venous blood sample ( 30 mL ) drawn vascular function measure , follow 2.5 h postprandial test vascular function measurement . As postprandial meal , subject receive high-fat milkshake . Before postprandial test cannula place blood sample t=0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 240 ( total volume 129.5 mL ) . Thus , entire 13 ( screen study ) week period , total 444 mL blood drawn . Vascular function measurement include panel non-invasive measurement , i.e . FMD , endo peripheral artherial tonometry ( endoPAT ) , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) retinal imaging . Subjects ask fill food frequency questionnaire two time keep study-diary throughout 12 week . On rare occasion , blood sampling might cause bruise hematoma . The vascular function measurement non-invasive cause burden . In subgroup 10 volunteer , 5 hour start postprandial test , small intestinal biopsy take duodenum determine difference intestinal apoA-I mRNA protein expression . Obtaining small intestinal biopsy standard flexible gastroscopy induces local discomfort pharynx procedure , take 15 minute , cause theoretical risk perforation ( 1:1000 ) infection risk 1:1.800.000 , low risk healthy subject . The complication serious subject stay hospital . If serious complaint gastroscopy ( e.g . vomit without blood , stomach ache ) subject warn project leader physician . Total time investment subject approximately 14.5 hour , 17.5 hour subgroup biopsy take , exclude travel time .</detailed_description>
