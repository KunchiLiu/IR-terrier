	<detailed_description>In light high cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality , promote simple intervention improve serum lipid decrease oxidative stress warrant help prevent chronic disease . Commonly prescribed dietary intervention cardiovascular disease risk reduction include use functional food know beneficial effect risk factor . Because fiber content , nopales ( prickly pear cactus pad Opuntia specie ) commonly regard among Mexicans medicinal plant glycemic cholesterol control . However , literature document purport hypocholesterolemic potential scarce . Most study focus prickly pear fruit , rather actual nopales cactus pad . Given unique composition potential benefit nopales , use may ideal approach adjunct therapy reduction cardiometabolic risk factor . The aim study evaluate efficacy 2-week intervention nopales pad reduction establish CVD risk factor ( serum lipid ) comparison control food lower antioxidant fiber content ( cucumber ) among adult moderate hypercholesterolemia randomize control crossover trial . Because limited data exists effect nopales supplementation factor associate cardiometabolic risk , exploratory assessment biomarkers insulin sensitivity , inflammation ( high sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] ) oxidative stress ( LDL oxidizability total antioxidant capacity ) also conduct . In randomized crossover trial , healthy adult moderate hypercholesterolemia ( LDL-cholesterol ≥ 120 mg/dL ) otherwise healthy randomly assign supplementation 2 cups/day nopales ( 300 g ; intervention ) cucumber ( 208 g ; control ) , divide two 1 cup daily dos two main meal . After 3-week washout period , group receive alternative treatment additional 2 week . Participants ask refrain make additional change usual diet throughout duration entire study . Fasting blood sample collect begin end dietary intervention . At begin end dietary intervention additional fasting blood sample collect least one day apart main blood collection day measurement serum lipid account day-to-day variability . Outcome measure include complete lipid panel ( total cholesterol , HDL-c , LDL-c , triglyceride ) , fast glucose , insulin , oxidize LDL LDL susceptibility oxidation , total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) , vitamin C .</detailed_description>
