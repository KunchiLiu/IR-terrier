We propose three-arm single blind , randomize ( 1:1:1 ) control trial ass whether negative question PCS affect measure mood , pain , disability . Aim : The aim study ass whether negative question PCS affect measure mood , pain , disability . Primary null hypothesis : There difference Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Upper Extremity Function patient complete standard PCS , patient complete positively adjust PCS , patient complete PCS . Secondary null hypothesis : There difference pain intensity , PROMIS depression , ( Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale ) PANAS score patient complete standard PCS , patient complete positively adjust PCS , patient complete PCS .</detailed_description>
