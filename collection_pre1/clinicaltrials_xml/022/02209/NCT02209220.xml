	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) syndrome characterize intermittent dynamic obstruction upper airways cause fall oxygen saturation , reflex sympathetic activation sleep micro-arousals . In surgical patient , OSA well-known risk factor perioperative complication . At Institut Universitaire de cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec ( IUCPQ ) , investigator perform 450 bariatric surgery per year . Consequently , identification management OSA high-risk surgical population essential part practice . Actual guideline recommend treatment OSA initiate surgical procedure . Presently , first line treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy deliver fixed pressure continuously maintain patency upper airway . However compliance therapy poor . An available alternative automatic positive airway pressure ( APAP ) deliver variable amount pressure prevent reduction airflow accompanies upper airway obstruction . The APAP delivers low pressure need prevent upper airways collapse . APAP significantly reduce mean level pressure deliver comparison conventional treatment . Theoretically , seem logical apply low pressure necessary would allow good device-patient synchrony therefore improve patient 's comfort.Recent trial compare APAP CPAP show APAP non-inferior CPAP control obstructive event . APAP would valuable alternative excess cost . However , APAP improve compliance treatment two type population : poor compliant subject need high pressure level . The investigator know compliance positive pressure poor patient without excessive daytime sleepiness , represent majority patient wait bariatric surgery . Moreover , patient need level pressure ≥ 10 water cm ( cmH20 ) , APAP improve treatment compliance , minimises side effect improve quality life . The review 180 file OSA patient treat CPAP bariatric surgery center 2012 demonstrated majority patient need high level pressure . These value suggest APAP could improve treatment compliance apneic patient wait bariatric surgery usually poorly symptomatic generally require high positive pressure level .</brief_summary>
