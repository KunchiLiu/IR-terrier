Certain measurement could improve performance resuscitation team , audio prompt checklist . Methods propose improvised improve quality CPR include CPR assist device , automatic driven device audio prompt system . However , method hardly incorporate original resuscitation process since could extra workload . Therefore , investigator try provide digitized checklist combine visual audio alarming system , could minimize workload chart record also remind team perform essential procedure time . Information gain video-recording evaluation system employ improve resuscitation skill . The improvement resuscitation quality also could find video-recording certain intervention . It also avoid interference resuscitation find harmful factor CPR quality .</brief_summary>
