	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE During last decade treatment guideline administration adjuvant chemotherapy patient breast cancer change , today advise chemotherapy majority patient &gt; 1cm invasive cancer . Prognostic factor use determine need adjuvant chemotherapy axillary lymph node status , tumour size grade , patient ' age , HER2 expression . In addition , HER2 status ER/PR also predictive effect particular adjuvant systemic therapy . Besides predictive model base histopathologic factor , gene expression array recognize four different molecular subtypes breast cancer ( Luminal A , Luminal B HER2 + , Luminal B HER2 - Triple negative ) . In addition , number gene expression profile design validated capacity predict risk dissemination . One gene expression profile 70-gene MammaPrint® signature . The 70-gene MammaPrint® validate different retrospective study , prospective community-based feasibility study ( RASTER ) . A considerable discrepancy risk estimation among different clinicopathologic guideline MammaPrint observe . In RASTER study , addition MammaPrint standard clinic-pathological factor lead change adjuvant systemic treatment advice 19 % patient . The 5-year metastasis free survival rate MammaPrint Low Risk ( n=219 ) High Risk ( n=208 ) patient 97,0 % 91,7 % . The recent Dutch CBO guideline ( 2012 ) breast cancer suggest use validate gene expression profile individual case patient invasive ductal carcinoma positive hormonal receptor doubt indication adjuvant chemotherapy base traditional prognostic factor . 2 . OBJECTIVES Primary objectives Assess impact MammaPrint® clinical decision make regard administration adjuvant chemotherapy CBO 2012 guideline define group hormone receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma patient doubt indication adjuvant chemotherapy base traditional prognostic factor . Secondary objective - To document influence primary tumour characteristic ( size , Bloom malignancy grade Her-2 status ) N-status ( N0 v N1mi ) respect ( Mammaprint-dependent ) decision give adjuvant chemotherapy predefined subgroup - To address doctor patient influence eventual decision give adjuvant chemotherapy . Hypothesis In group patient contemporary national guideline advocate use systemic therapy doctor ambivalent treat patient adjuvant chemotherapy , hypothesize use MammaPrint® additional test change indication adjuvant therapy substantial proportion patient result least 10 % less patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy . Thus , study group least 10 % less patient receive chemotherapy compare contemporary group patient similar clinicopathological characteristic without use MammaPrint® 3 . STUDY POPULATION Population ( base ) The study population CBO 2012 guideline define group hormone receptor positive , invasive ductal breast cancer patient doubt indication adjuvant chemotherapy base traditional prognostic factor . Doubt indication adjuvant chemotherapy base traditional prognostic factor ill-defined criterion . Potential difference individual judgement medical oncologist decide adjuvant systemic therapy conceivable , translate difference tendency use MammaPrint® . Based CBO-guideline 2012 , expect tendency use MammaPrint® small , low-grade tumour well patient lymph node macrometastases relatively low . Based aforementioned assumption expect proportional composition study group 'of hormone receptor positive , invasive ductal breast cancer patient doubt indication adjuvant chemotherapy base traditional prognostic factor ' follow : N0 , BR 1 , &gt; 2 cm : 10-15 % ( 60-90 patient ) N0 , BR 2 , &gt; 1 cm : 50-60 % ( 300-350 patient ) N1mi , grade 1,2 : 15-20 % ( 90-120 patient ) Her+ , N0 , &lt; 2c , grade I : &lt; 5 % ( &lt; 30 patient ) NI : &lt; 5 % ( &lt; 30 patient ) N0 , BR 1 , 1-2 cm : &lt; 5 % ( &lt; 30 patient ) Control group For comparison , data regard adjuvant chemotherapy patient MammaPrint® use obtain national registry Netherlands Cancer Registry ( NKR ) match MammaPrint® group date diagnosis clinicopathological characteristic . The control group enable analysis impact Mammaprint proportion patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy . 4 . STUDY DESIGN This prospective multicentre impact study MammaPrint® clinical decision making predefined group patient doctor patient ambivalent adjuvant chemotherapy . MammaPrint® offer addition standard histopathology test decision-making regard adjuvant systemic therapy . The advised adjuvant systemic therapy record disclosure MammaPrint® result . Logistical planning : Post-surgery : 1 . Every patient discuss multidisciplinary team meeting treatment advice . After definitive pathological assessment tumour size , Bloom Richardson grade , confirmation ER/PR- HER2 status , potential inclusion patient assess . 2 . In surgical outpatient clinic , patient see postoperatively histopathological result discuss . The surgeon inform patient conclusion multidisciplinary team patient inform exist uncertainty adjuvant treatment add value MammaPrint . Study information supply include Informed Consent form . 3 . The pathologist send MammaPrint kit Agendia analyse . The attend surgeon and/or research nurse register patient complete electronic Case Report Form ( CRF ) 1 . 4 . MammaPrint® result email surgeon , medical oncologist mammacare nurse within 10 working day . 5 . Within two week patient see outpatient clinic oncologist discus result MammaPrint® . A final decision concern adjuvant chemotherapy make patient . CRF 2 complete oncologist . The study expect enrol 600 patient approximately 25 hospital two half year . The follow regarding advice adjuvant treatment estimate two month , start adjuvant chemotherapy . 5 . TISSUE COLLECTION AND 'CLASSIC ' HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION After patient ' approval sign consent form , sample send Agendia MammaPrint® analysis . The tissue specimen MammaPrint® analysis consist tumour block 10 unstained slide 5µm section slide . The tissue ship formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) tissue . 6 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics The primary endpoint define group patient receive adjuvant systemic therapy compare proportion patient advise receive chemotherapy knowledge MammaPrint® result . In addition , use NKR/NBCA data control , absolute difference proportion patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy evaluate . This absolute difference evaluate whole group well three expectedly large subgroup . Statistical analysis Baseline characteristic summarize incidence table . The frequency chemotherapy + endocrine versus endocrine alone decision address receive MammaPrint result study group . A McNemars test perform comparison two proportion treat ( ) , express percentage . When p- value McNemars test less 0.05 , conclusion two proportion indeed differ significantly . Chi-square test ( binary variable ) , non-parametric Mann-Whitney test ( continuous variable - 2 group ) non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test ( continuous variable - group ) use comparison population characteristic different subgroup . When p- value less 0.05 , conclusion significant difference subgroup variable . The percentage treatment change calculate whole study group three predefined subgroup . The distribution MammaPrint test result summarize frequency table . With predefined sample size whole group ( n=600 ) , control group consist least 1800 patient minimal detectable difference proportion patient receive chemotherapy 6.6 % whole group 9.3 % subgroup 300 patient ( 2-sided alpha 0.05 , Power 80 ) . After inclusion first 150 patient , additional sample size calculation conduct base actual proportion subgroup . 7 . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Regulation statement This study conduct accord principle Declaration Helsinki ( version 6 , February 2008 ) accordance Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( WMO ) legal regulatory framework .</detailed_description>
