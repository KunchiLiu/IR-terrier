	<brief_summary>Low grade glioma ( LGGs ) common primary central nervous system malignancy . Brain surgery possible extent resection endeavor achieve longer survival LGG patient . For patient tumor locate eloquent area gross total resection applicable , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) 2013 guideline assign radiotherapy chemotherapy adjuvant treatment low grade glioma follow surgery . Retrospective study suggest temozolomide ( oral chemotherapeutics ) chemotherapy good effect control tumor progression recurrence LGG patient surgery , especially isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) gene mutation . Therefore , prospective cohort study provide high level ( IIb ) evidence correlation IDH mutation responsiveness up-front adjuvant metronomic temozolomide chemotherapy young patient LGG locate eloquent brain area . And hopefully justify future RCTs comparison effect adjuvant radiotherapy chemotherapy patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Cohort Study Effect Temozolomide IDH Mutational Low Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low grade glioma , accord 2007 WHO classification tumor central nervous system , include astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas , oligoastrocytomas . It contribute 25 % diffuse gliomas 15 % glioma adult . The majority age group vulnerable neoplasm 30-45 year old . Median survival usually 5-12 year , prolong 20 year optimal treatment strategy . National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Chinese Guideline Gliomas 2012 point LGG patient low-risk group ( oligodendrogliomas oligoastrocytomas ; 40 year old ; KPS 80 high ; tumor size le 6cm ; minor neurological deficit ) , `` wait see '' strategy could consider gross total resection ; tumor eloquent area gross total resection applicable , standard strategy specific group patient maximum safely resection adjuvant treatment ( radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy ) . Conventionally , radiotherapy use adjuvant treatment surgery . However , recent phase III randomize trial compare early versus later irradiation demonstrate early adjuvant radiotherapy significant impact overall survival . Moreover , radiotherapy brings much side effect control tumor recurrence . It inevitably jeopardize patient , especially young one , post-radiation cognitive deficit , impair social function . On hand , chemotherapy could safer adjuvant treatment LGG . Several phase II III study demonstrate single chemotherapy effective treating LGG , 50-75 % response rate ( include minor response ) , 24-48 month median duration response.PCV regimen ( procarbazine-CCNU-vincristine ) , administrate intravenously , use consider standard LGG ( oligodendrogliomas oligoastrocytomas ) chemotherapy , temozolomide ( TMZ ) , oral alkylating agent , relatively less side effect PCV regimen , gain gradual acceptance . Now propose up-front adjuvant chemotherapy achieve effect early tumor control well avoidance postponement adverse effect cause premature adjuvant radiotherapy . As different schedule temozolomide , systematic review suggest indication metronomic regimen TMZ ( 75 mg/m2/day 21 day repeat every 4 week ) result good PFS response rate compare conventional standard 5 day regimen ( 200 mg/m2/day 5 day , repeat every 4 week ) , despite insufficient available data study heterogeneity , thus justify future well design trial verify efficacy metronomic regimen . More frequent administration TMZ lead MGMT ( O6-methylguanine DNA methyl transferase ) depletion render high level O6-methylated DNA adduct , thus reduce chemotherapeutic resistance . The spontaneous behavior LGGs , well response therapy , difficult predict , outcome highly variable . These clinical feature closely relevant genetic characteristic , include IDH ( isocitrate dehydrogenase ) gene , 2 subtypes , IDH1 IDH2 ( less common ) . These genetic mutation occur 70 % primary LGGs . And prognostic significance glioma report New England Journal Medicine , Journal Clinical Oncology , Neuro-oncology . A retrospective study suggest predictive value high LGGs sensitivity TMZ . Basic research provide u rationale overexpression wild IDH1 gene result chemotherapy resistance high dose TMZ vivo vitro , IDH1 mutation cause cell cycle arrest G1 stage , compromise ability proliferation invasion , raise sensitivity chemotherapy . During previous clinical practice , interest reveal consistence IDH mutation , MGMT methylation 1p19q co-deletion WHO Grade II Grade III glioma . It theoretically acknowledge potential high sensitivity TMZ chemotherapy LGGs . In order verify predictive significance IDH mutation high sensitivity LGGs eloquent area entail gross total resection inapplicable , high level evidence provide . And recent RANO ( response assessment neuro-oncology ) revise guideline evaluation objective response rate , cognitive function , quality life well facilitate standard trial .</detailed_description>
