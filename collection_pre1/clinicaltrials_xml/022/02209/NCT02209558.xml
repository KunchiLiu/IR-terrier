	<brief_summary>Sternal precaution standard patient education protocol disseminate post-operative open heart surgery patient . While `` best practice '' safety measure widely distribute patient , origin say precaution unknown . Statewide hospital vary parameter sternal precaution use myriad restriction , i.e . weighted activity , biomechanical movement avoid . In addition , medium sternal precaution taught varies , thus complicate patient adherence vital post-operative measure . The primary objective study use randomize pre-post test design compare two different training procedure . One training group examine current standard care ( provide verbal instruction use teach back write sternal precaution ) . The second training group provide subject visual depiction sternal precaution , addition standard care . The study analyze 30 60 day readmission rate aforementioned patient . Finally , study ass change behavior intention train train group via behavioral analysis survey consist 8 question . Hypothesis 1 : The investigator hypothesize subject provide visual sternal precaution , addition standard care , low 30 60 day readmission rate compare subject standard care group Hypothesis 2 : The investigator hypothesize change behavior intention toward sternal precaution great train train visual SPs addition standard care group standard care group .</brief_summary>
