	<detailed_description>Hip fracture associate large hidden blood loss . That , total blood loss associate hip fracture surgery much great observed intra operatively . The total blood loss depend type fracture associate surgery . Extra-capsular fracture treat intramedullary nail thus associate large hidden blood loss median approximately 1500 ml . This hidden blood loss primarily associate trauma fracture , , surgical procedure . Postoperative anaemia necessitate transfusion haemoglobin level 8 g per dL , hip fracture patient , associate increased mortality Controversy remain benefit indication transfusion group patient . There currently viable method identify patient risk transfusion . The admission haemoglobin level show falsely reassure . TEG knowledge use one previous study hip fracture . The outcome measure study thromboembolic event . We able identify study use TEG , INR , APTT test predictor blood loss hip fracture patient . Clinicians would greatly benefit tool predict at-risk patient admission . TEG suggest tool . Bolliger et al suggests TEG use goal-oriented algorithms optimize target transfusion therapy trauma patient patient undergo major surgery . We hypothesize TEG use purpose patient hip fracture . These patient large blood loss sustain double trauma hip fracture major orthopaedic surgery .</detailed_description>
