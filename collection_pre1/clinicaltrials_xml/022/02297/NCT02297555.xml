	<detailed_description>Obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) 30 kg / m² , affect 14 % French population . This condition associate several co-morbidities , increased mortality , mainly due cardiovascular disease cancer . These risk much high obesity associate metabolic syndrome . Conventional medical care metabolic syndrome , even conduct multidisciplinary team combine dietary advice , physical activity psychological treatment offer limit result , weight reduction comorbidities . Bariatric surgery allow however significant sustained weight loss majority case , decrease frequency severity co-morbidities , include type 2 diabetes , decrease mortality include cardiovascular . Considered invasive many practitioner patient , surgery therefore propose small proportion patient could theoretically benefit . The result surgery , however , validate principle interventional treatment obesity metabolic complication . Different technique may replace surgery currently develop . Among new approach , successful device `` endoluminal liner ENDOBARRIER® '' ( GI Dynamics ™ , Boston , USA ) . The ENDOBARRIER® device could represent major innovation non-surgical management obesity . The benefit instal device morbidity associate obesity report literature : impact hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome . This trial compare randomize study result , tolerance cost interventional therapy device ENDOBARRIER® conventional therapy French patient obesity metabolic syndrome , without diabetes . The evaluation cost-effectiveness device clarify role strategy management obesity comorbidities .</detailed_description>
