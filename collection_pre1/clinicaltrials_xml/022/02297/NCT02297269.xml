	<brief_title>The Impact Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgeries Incidence Postoperative Deep Vein Thrombosis Patients With Gastrointestinal Malignancy -- -A Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared open surgery ( OS ) , laparoscopic surgery ( LS ) conduct less invasion , less pain decrease rate wound infection probably improve quality life patient . For benefit , laparoscopic surgery widely use gastrointestinal surgery . DVT common complication surgery . However , whether LS reduce incidence postoperative DVT unclear . So investigators conduct cohort study , sufficient sample size rigorous scientific overview , investigate impact laparoscopic versus open surgery incidence postoperative DVT patient gastrointestinal malignancy . This study approve institutional review board First Affiliated Hospital Chongqing Medical University . The protocol design accordance Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement . This study design cohort study investigate incidence postoperative DVT patient undergo gastrointestinal malignancy laparoscopic surgery ( group LS ) open surgery ( group OS ) . Participants group LS receive laparoscopic gastrointestinal malignancy surgery . Participants group OS receive open gastrointestinal malignancy surgery . All participant receive unify post-operative analgesia prophylaxis infection thromboembolism . The primary outcome study incidence DVT laparoscopic open gastrointestinal malignancy surgery within 7 day postoperatively . The secondary outcome study include : concentration plasma D - dimer 2 , time first flatus mobility , incidence lung infection infection incision within 7 day postoperatively , lengths hospital stay . This study conduct supervision independent auditor . Every week , auditor check data participant day survey conduct . Assessment pain intensity prognostic outcome must confirm auditor sample population . When disagreement surgeon anesthesiologist evaluate prognosis patient , auditor must solve disagreement discussion evaluator . Data double-entered two statistician limitation access lock statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
