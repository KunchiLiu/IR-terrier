	<brief_summary>Patients history blood clot risk develop additional clot future . Doctors use tool call clinical decision rule tell likely patient blood clot test look clot . This tool may cause doctor over-diagnosis recurrent clot symptom may leave previous clot . Correctly diagnose recurrent blood clot important since risk associate over-diagnosis under-diagnosis . If recurrent blood clot miss ( under-diagnosis ) patient risk death clot lung . If blood thinner prescribe need ( over-diagnosis ) , patient may take blood thinner lifetime risk serious bleeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several tool develop standardize diagnostic management suspect first blood clot . One tool use clinical decision rule . Clinical decision rule design help clinician make diagnostic therapeutic decision bedside . A score compute presence criterion patient 's medical history , clinical sign symptom . The score provide probability blood clot . The rule use combination simple blood test - call D-dimer - identify patient low risk n't require diagnostic image test . Benefits include reduce cost , length hospital radiation exposure . Patients prior blood clot show less likely benefit non-invasive testing . Therefore , often need undergo imaging test , frequently difficult interpret patient prior blood clot since residual clot often present difficult distinguish recurrent clot . The objective study try prospectively assess role exist clinical decision rule patient prior blood clot , attempt improve order increase yield non-invasive test reduce risk over-diagnosis imaging test .</detailed_description>
