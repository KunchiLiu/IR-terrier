	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective , randomize , single-blinded , placebo-controlled phase II trial trastuzumab + nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF versus trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone . Our target study population high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer patient . High-risk HER2-positive breast cancer patient define : Those HER2-positive breast cancer , regardless hormone receptor status , receive neoadjuvant therapy approve regimen include trastuzumab least four cycle ( 12 week ) taxane-containing chemotherapy , fail achieve pCR . Those HER2-positive breast cancer , regardless hormone receptor status , undergo surgery first intervention find ≥ 4 positive lymph node . Those HER2-positive , hormone receptor negative breast cancer undergo surgery first intervention find 1-3 positive lymph node . Disease-free subject standard care multi-modality therapy screen HLA-typed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Combination Immunotherapy With NeuVax Trastuzumab High-risk HER2+ Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator intend assess ability combination trastuzumab HER2 vaccine nelipepimut-S ( administer immunoadjuvant GM-CSF ) give adjuvant set prevent recurrence patient high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer . High-risk defined patient achieve pCR neoadjuvant therapy approve regimen include trastuzumab least four cycle ( 12 week ) taxane-containing chemotherapy undergo upfront surgery find great equal four positive lymph node regardless hormone receptor status 1-3 positive lymph node hormone receptor negative . Following surgery , patient screen HLA-typed ( consent # 1 ) . Nelipepimut-S CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine restrict HLA-2+ HLA-A3+ HLA-A24+ HLA-A26+ patient ( approximately 80 % US population ) . HLA-A2+/A3+/A24+/orA26+ patient meet eligibility criterion randomize receive trastuzumab + nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone ( consent # 2 ) . The trastuzumab administer patient consistent current standard care . Patients randomize nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF arm receive vaccination nelipepimut-S ( 1000 mcg ) GM-CSF ( 250 mcg ) administer intradermally every three week six total vaccination , 30-120 minute completion trastuzumab infusion . The first vaccination give third dose maintenance trastuzumab administer monotherapy optimally , may give later maintenance dos trastuzumab , provide least six remain dos trastuzumab overlap primary vaccine series . Patients randomize GM-CSF alone arm receive inoculation GM-CSF ( 250 mcg ) administer identical manner receive nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF . Patients blind whether receive nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF GM-CSF alone . Upon completion primary vaccination/inoculation series , booster inoculation ( dose route ) administer every six month x 4 . The first booster inoculation occur 6 month ± 2 week completion PVS , subsequent booster time every six month + 2 week . Boosters therefore occur follow time point completion PVS : 6 month ± 2 week , 12 month ± 2 week , 18 month ± 2 week , 24 month ± 2 week . Booster inoculation occur patient randomized receive nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF well patient randomize receive GM-CSF alone , consist treatment drug dose ( i.e. , nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF patient boost nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF GM-CSF alone patient boost GM-CSF alone ) . Patient blinding maintain throughout study . Subjects follow safety issue , immunologic response clinical recurrence . Patients monitor 48-72 hour inoculation reaction inoculation well documentation adverse effect experience . Immunologic response monitor primarily vivo delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction also may document immunologic assay . All patient follow total 36 month time initiation trastuzumab maintenance therapy document disease-free status .</detailed_description>
