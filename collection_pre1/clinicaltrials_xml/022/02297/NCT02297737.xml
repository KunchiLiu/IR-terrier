	<brief_title>Mindful Movement Intervention Post-MI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year around 785,000 Americans endure first heart attack half another future . The American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) aid prevention future heart attack . Despite benefit CR , small proportion eligible patient participate CR . Patients illness , woman , old adult , ethnic minority least likely utilize CR service . Many medical center CR program patient travel distant location undergo CR . In turn , Tai Chi study elderly , require expensive equipment , practice home , well tolerate across fitness level co-occurring illness . Tai Chi serve aerobic exercise low moderate intensity . However , Tai Chi study post-MI patient employ state-of-the-art measure cardiac function exercise capacity therefore unclear whether Tai Chi similar benefit CR period recovery heart attack . This study innovative specifically target patient opted participate formal CR program within 6 month first-time heart attack emphasize recruitment patient span old age range , physical function ability , woman minority . A total 75 men woman first time heart attack randomly assign 24 session Tai Chi training compose 8 meditative movement equivalent `` dose '' Health Education class . Clinical assessment perform 4-5 month period , test occur , mid-way , treatment , 8-week follow-up . Our goal gather preliminary data study feasibility , acceptability find indication improvement measure cardiac health , physical function , health behavior , mental health . If aims meet exploratory/development study , future large scale study undertaken confirm Tai Chi 's effectiveness post-heart attack patient . Such research critically need aid development effective rehabilitative intervention acceptable wider range patient .</detailed_description>
