However , full-blown cognitive/linguistic , anatomic biologic characterization three main variant remain incomplete give available data derive relatively small patient sample . Such three-fold characterisation major milestone prospective provide rationale therapeutic intervention comprise specific rehabilitation protocols pharmacological trial . The present study address thesis issue three PPA main variant cross-sectional longitudinal investigation explore 1 ) cognitive/linguistic feature , 2 ) anatomic/metabolic specification ( MRI-VBM , MRI-fiber tracking , functional connectivity - MRI rest state , PET ) , 3 ) biologic aspect ( CSF biomarkers , genetic screening ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale Primary progressive aphasia ( PPA ) umbrella term identifies group neurodegenerative disease characterize language deficit . By definition , language disorder isolate least two year ; subsequently disease extends cognitive area lead global dementia . Usually PPA affect relatively young patient 50 65 year age . The outcome fatal 10 15 year . No treatment currently available . Three variant PPA describe : progressive nonfluent aphasia ( PNFA ) , fluent PPA semantic dementia ( SD ) , logopenic progressive aphasia ( LPA ) . These variant characterize difference nature language deficit , pattern brain atrophy underlie pathology , comprise Alzheimer 's pathology 30 % patient PPA . In spite grow interest , cognitive , anatomic biologic characterization 3 PPA variant remain incomplete available data derive study small patient sample . However , three-fold characterisation essential order provide rationale therapeutic intervention comprise specific rehabilitation language pharmacological treatment . In particular , pharmacological approach crucially depend well knowledge underlie histopathology ( e.g. , existence Alzheimer pathology ) , well understand damage neural network may provide evidence implication specific neurotransmitter . Our aim address issue explore large population patient PPA associate psycholinguistic tool , cutting-edge technique neuroimaging , CSF biomarker analyse genetic screening . The study provide cross-sectional longitudinal assessment PPA patient involve 17 memory centre qualify domain PPA . Main objective Providing comprehensive characterisation 3 PPA variant cross-sectional longitudinal approach investigate 1 ) cognitive feature ( psycholinguistic ) , 2 ) anatomic/metabolic substrate ( structural MRI , DTI-based tractography , functional connectivity - resting state , 18FDG-PET ) , 3 ) biologic aspect ( CSF biomarkers [ amyloid-β tau ] , genetic screening mutation progranulin gene , apolipoprotein E genotyping ) . Secondary objective 1 ) Identification prognostic marker ( linguistic , anatomical/metabolic , biologic ) PPA variant . 2 ) Identification predictive marker ( linguistic , neuroimaging ) underlie histopathology ( correlation analyse among linguistic , image , CSF genetic marker ) . 3 ) Validation diagnostic criterion semantic dementia distinguish fluent/semantic variant PPA form multimodal disorder semantics ( verbal visual ) . Perspectives Providing rationale drug trial specific language rehabilitation . Methodology One hundred twenty-five PPA patient 40 healthy age-matched control include study . Patients recruit national network include `` national center reference rare dementia '' 10 associate `` Centers competence '' , well six additional hospital , experience domain PPA . Study design : The duration study three year ( 18 month inclusion , 18 month exploration ) . Participants assessed inclusion ( M0 ) , 9 month ( M9 ) 18 month ( M18 ) . The exploration subdivide 3 work package , coordinate supervisor . 1 ) Cognitive work package ( M0 , M9 , M18 ) : A ) Neuropsychological language test use standardize internationally validated battery ; B ) Neuropsychological battery specially conceive explore verbal visual semantics ( validation new diagnostic criterion semantic dementia ; secondary objective N° 3 ) ; C ) Language assessment use specifically target paradigm base psycholinguistic model . Imaging work package ( M0 , M18 ) : A ) MRI MRI-based tractography detect quantify cortical atrophy , involvement white matter tract study functional connectivity ( rest state fMRI ) ; B ) 18FDG-PET study metabolic defect cortex basal ganglion . 3 ) Biologic work package ( M0 ; control ) : Lumbar puncture analysis biomarkers CSF ( amyloid-β , tau ) ; B ) genetic analysis peripheral blood : quantification plasma progranulin ( accord result ) screen mutation progranulin gene ; apolipoprotein E genotyping . Statistics . Cross-sectional analysis inter-group comparison ( PPA group , healthy control ) longitudinal analysis inter-group intra-group comparison ( M0 , M9 , M18 ) .</detailed_description>
