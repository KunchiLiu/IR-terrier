	<brief_title>Assessment Coagulation Thrombocyte Function After Termination Ticagrelor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute coronary syndrome today often treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) insertion one several coronary stent . Subsequently , patient treat oral anti-platelet ( OAP ) drug , usually combination acetyl salicylic acid ( aspirin ) clopidogrel/ticagrelor . Although aspirin continue life-long period , clopidogrel/ticagrelor use variable period time , often 3 month - 1 year PCI , depend type stent . Interventional elective non-cardiac surgery time clopidogrel/ticagrelor therapy recommend except life-threatening ( acute surgery ) life-prolonging ( cancer surgery ) procedure . Specifically life-prolonging procedure , surgery plan , therefore question often arise OAPs terminate prior plan surgery . This decision rest balance risk bleed ( continue ) coronary stent thrombosis ( stop ) . Certainly , small risk severe bleed use aspirin , drug continue throughout perioperative period patient coronary stent . However , continue clopidogrel/ticagrelor controversial since severe perioperative bleeding difficult reverse patient . Therefore , surgeon would normally discontinue clopidogrel/ticagrelor prior surgery , specifically potential bleeding high , consequence major . The exact duration drug discontinue remains unclear , depend drug use , period 3 - 5 day generally recommend , base pharmacokinetics dynamic clopidogrel/ticagrelor otherwise healthy patient . This study do well understand coagulation thrombocyte function immediately discontinuation ticagrelor regular interval termination , patient previously undergone PCI , coronary stent , take ticagrelor discontinue one-year therapy accordance hospital routine . No surgical intervention plan patient termination ticagrelor .</detailed_description>
