	<brief_summary>Damage control laparotomy ( DCL ) proven successful mean improve survival severely injured patients.1-5 However , consequence able close fascia initial operation due significant resuscitation lead bowel retroperitoneal edema , abdominal compartment syndrome , continue acidosis , coagulopathy hypethermia6-7 lead new challenge . Delays primary fascial closure ( PFC ) contribute increased fluid loss nutritional demands,8-9 abdominal wall hernia , enterocutaneous fistula , intra-abdominal infections.10-13 Hypertonic saline ( HTS ) use DCL suggest reduce bowel edema resuscitation volume , thus allow quick time closure.14 Investigators randomize patient receive HTS standard crystalloid solution DCL compare time PFC , rate successful closure , rate complication associate open abdomen . The current failure rate PFC DCL approximately 25 % . Investigators believe improve PFC rate use hypertonic saline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use HTS DCL may decrease rate failure achieve PFC reduce number complication associate open abdomen . Research Questions : 1 . Primary Objective : Is high rate PFC among patient undergo DCL temporary abdominal closure use HTS versus standard crystalloid resuscitation ? 2 . Secondary Objectives : Does successful faster PFC reduce ICU , ventilator hospital day ? 3 . Does faster successful PFC result low morbidity include enterocutaneous fistula ( ECF ) , intra-abdominal abscess ( IAA ) , abdominal wall hernia , anastomotic failure ? DCL common procedure wound warrior undergo due blast blunt penetrate mechanisms injury . This result significant population warrior risk complication comorbidities accompany open abdomen . Thus , find way achieve PFC also decrease time PFC reduce unwanted event . The protocol design multi-institutional , prospective , double blind , randomize controlled trial patient undergo DCL abdominal trauma require temporary abdominal closure return operate room definitive treatment . All participate facility Level I Trauma Centers . Currently , standard care damage control resuscitation involve intravenous fluid solution utilized study ; normal saline , Ringer 's lactate , Plasmalyte , 3 % saline ( HTS ) . However , type fluid select base surgeon preference alone . Investigators randomize patient normal saline resuscitation rate 30 cc/hr 3 % saline ( HTS ) resuscitation rate 30cc/hr initiate upon arrival ICU .</detailed_description>
