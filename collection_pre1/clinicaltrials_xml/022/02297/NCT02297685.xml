	<brief_summary>Objective : The aim investigation compare effectiveness transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) interferential current ( IC ) chronic low back pain . Forty-eight patient diagnose chronic low back pain randomly assign three group : control ( sham electrotherapy ; age 47 ± 8 year ) , interferential current ( IC ; age 48 ± 8 year ) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ; age 48 ± 8 year ) . Patients group receive 12 × 30-min session assign treatment period 4 week plus therapeutic exercise . Before treatment , low back pain measure use 100-mm visual analogue scale functional disability level measure use Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire . Participants status follow 3 month end treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects The subject study recruit wait list Almendrales Physiotherapy Center ( Madrid , Spain ) . Potential participant older 18 year present continuous low back pain 12 week . Potential participant examine independent specialist diagnosis LBP make accord medical diagnosis , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMQD ) 24 X-ray . With inclusion criterion , total 96 patient contacted participate experiment . Twenty-one participant exclude fulfilled one several follow exclusion criterion : individual present trauma , disc disease lumbosciaticas ; individual receive pain-relieving treatment another physiotherapy method time ; patient previous surgery intra-articular injection ; individual contraindication electrotherapy ; decline participate . Treatment group The experimental design randomize , double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial . After preliminary examination , 48 patient randomly assign three group : control ( sham electrotherapy ) , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) interferential current ( IC ) . A set seal sequentially numbered opaque envelope use group assignment . The study double-blind examiner contact patient duration treatment patient informed electrotherapy technique receive investigation . Intervention Each treatment apply 3 time per week alternate day ( exclude weekend ) period 4 week , include total 12 session . All treatment administer experienced physiotherapist . Four surface electrode ( 5×5 cm Prim-Trode® , Spain ) symmetrically place L1 L5 transverse process respect spine ; current intensity set 3 time session accord patient 's sensitivity . The patient inform may may feel sensation application site electrode . The group IC receive base frequency 4000 Hz AMF = 65 Hz , sweep = 95 Hz slope 1/1 tetrapolar mode ( Endomed 492 Enraf-nonius , Netherlands ) . The group TENS receive current frequency 80 Hz pulse width 150 μs two channel ( P-82 TENS med Enraf-nonius , Netherlands ) . Participants control group receive procedure ( e.g. , electrode placement ) current always equal 0 . In session , electrical stimulation technique administer 30 minute subject comfortable seat adjustable chair . After electrostimulation procedure , participant perform 30-min session therapeutic exercise . The session include lumbar stabilization ( 5 different exercise ) conventional stretching ( 5 different exercise ) . Each exercise perform 10 repetition 60 rest exercise . These exercise routines add electrotherapy technique investigate request Ethics Committee order provide treatment participant . Outcome measurement The day onset treatment ( pre-treatment ) day end treatment ( post-treatment ) , intensity low back pain evaluate use 100-mm visual analogue pain scale ( VAS ) . The functional status individual measure use Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) time-points . The RMDQ simple , fast valid questionnaire ass LBP disability . It consist 24 item reflect limitation different activity daily live attribute patient low back pain . Each item receive score 1 point , RMDQ score range 0 ( disability ) 24 point ( maximum possible disability ) . The use disability scale , RMDQ , show correlate physical incapacity well scale measure intensity pain , X Rays , magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRIs ) , computerized tomography scan . The straight leg raise ( SLR ) legs also use measure range motion leg . For measurement , inclinometer ( Baseline , Enterprises Inc. , USA ) apply anterior tibial tuberosity patient lie treatment stretcher . To prevent external rotation hip , contralateral leg fix strap stretcher . The examiner passively flex participant 's hip knee fully extend subject felt tightness hamstring area low back destabilize . The SLR ( degree ) calculate separately leg use one repetition . Pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) measure lumbosacral joint right leave sacroiliac joint application pressure algometer ( FPK 20 , Wagner Instruments , USA ) rubber tip 1 cm2 . The PPT record maximal pressure ( kg/cm2 ) apply participant perceive painful . The PPT measure location repeat three time 1 min rest repetition . The average value 3 measurement use analysis . Three month end treatment , RMDQ apply participant evaluate LBP disability maintenance improvement obtain treatment . The follow-up performed independent experimenter experimental condition . Statistical analysis All data analyze use SPSS v.20 statistical package . Descriptive statistic calculate group ( mean standard deviation ) . Normality test Shapiro-Wilk test . All variable present normal distribution test ( P &gt; 0.05 ) . Baseline characteristic compare use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) measure independent data . Pre-to-post treatment change comparison group perform use two-way ANOVA ( group x time ) . After significant F test , difference mean identified use Tukey 's HSD post hoc procedure . The level significance establish P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
