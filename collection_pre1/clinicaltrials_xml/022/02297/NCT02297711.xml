The result operative treatment single center report good excellent 70 - 90 % patient promising result report use open minimal repair ( OMR ) technique . There randomized trial compare open versus laparoscopic technique regard time recovery relief pain . The aim randomize study compare effectiveness OMR technique local spinal anesthesia endoscopic Total ExtraPeritoneal ( TEP ) technique general anesthesia treatment Sportsman´s hernia/athletic pubalgia .

	<brief_title>TEP Versus Open Minimal Suture Repair Sportsman 's Groin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic groin pain athlete physically active adult 5 10 % ( 1-3 ) . The groin area vulnerable contact sport soccer , ice hockey , rugby require sudden muscle contraction around hip low abdomen , repetitive kick side-to-side motion . Common cause chronic groin pain sport include adductor tendonitis , musculus rectus abdominis tendopathy , osteitis pubis ( edema MRI scan pubic symphysis ) disruption posterior wall inguinal canal , refer athletic pubalgia ( 1-3 ) . No exact pathophysiological mechanism pain far identify sportsman 's hernia ( posterior inguinal wall deficiency ) . A tear abdominal wall posterior inguinal canal conjoin tendon ( tendinopathy ) , without bulge hernia , suggest typical sportsman 's hernia ( 4-6 ) . The tissue damage similar incipient direct inguinal hernia without bulge . Diagnosis sportsman 's hernia set patient typical history suspect posterior inguinal wall deficiency careful clinical examination . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform exclude injury groin area . Sometimes also ultrasonography ( US ) would add diagnostic work-up . Although present similarly symptom , clinical entity `` sportsman 's hernia '' exclusively distinct athletic pubalgia ( 7 ) , include wide range groin injury , adductor tendonitis and/or inflammation pubic symphysis ( 8,9 ) . Treatment chronic groin pain aim toward specific pathology ( 1-3 ) . The first line management include rest , muscle strengthen stretch exercise , physiotherapy , anti-inflammatory analgesic , well local anesthetic and/or corticosteroid injection . In resistant case , operative treatment might consider . Various operative approach athlete 's pubalgia propose depend suspected nature injury . These operative approach include open ( 5,10 ) laparoscopic method hernia repair ( 11-12 ) , tenotomies muscle tendon close pubic bone ( 13,14 ) , well release neurectomy nearby nerve ( 6-7 ) . The result operative treatment good excellent 70 90 % patient ( 1-3 ) . There evidence-based consensus available guide surgeon choose various operative treatment sportsman 's hernia/athletic pubalgia ( 1 ) . Both conventional open laparoscopic repair produce good result , although latter may allow patient earlier return full sport activity . Open minimal repair ( OMR ) technique local spinal anesthesia seem promising surgical approach treatment posterior inguinal wall deficiency ( 10 ) . Recent one-center analysis technique report full freedom pain 91 % four week operation , full recovery sport 2 week good patient 's satisfaction 100 % . The laparoscopic technique report give excellent outcome 80-90 % patient . These method expensive need perform general anesthesia . The study also heterogeneous concern use different type mesh fixation technique ( 11-12 ) . Comparative study OMR technique laparoscopic treatment sportsman 's hernia/athletic pubalgia lacking . The OMR technique develop solely strengthen posterior inguinal wall weakness use non-absorbable suture , theoretically TEP technique may heal wide area groin utilize 10x15 cm mesh place preperitoneal space behind pubic symphysis posterior inguinal canal ( 11 ) . The aim randomize study compare effectiveness OMR technique local spinal anesthesia TEP technique general anesthesia treatment Sportsman´s hernia/athletic pubalgia primary endpoint ; patient totally free groin pain sport activity four week surgery .</detailed_description>
