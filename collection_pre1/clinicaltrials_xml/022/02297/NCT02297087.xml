	<brief_summary>Aim 1 - Launch Pilot Study . In aim , investigator seek launch pilot study enroll 12 eligible patient advance small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) obtain necessary tumor biopsy yield sufficient DNA RNA Genome-Wide Sequencing ( GWS ) . Aim 2 - Treatment Selection . Completion study aim provide new clinical paradigm treatment SCLC individual patient would treat single-agent combination therapy commercially available agent relate particular target ( ) identify via GWS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants consent study find meet study inclusion criterion . The clinical staff schedule tissue biopsy blood draw participant . Blood send Ashion DNA extraction . Tumor specimens ship Ashion DNA RNA extraction . Ashion process sample DNA RNA Sequencing CLIA certify laboratory . A portion nucleic acid store Ashion use confirm actionable target . Results submit physician possible inclusion treatment regimen . After sequence analysis perform , report provide treating oncologist . The PI treat oncologist may review result identify potential treatment . The treat oncologist may use information discretion , require treat patient base target identify GWS analysis .</detailed_description>
