It randomize intervention arm one receive intervention order genotyped group compare one undisturbed , routine clinical care carry patient take drug . Both arm follow year prescribed targeted medication . Patients randomize intervention arm prescribe one 24 targeted index medication receive pharmacogenomic test use custom micro-array measure 51 Single nucleotide polymorphisms 16 gene . The study conduct Indiana University School Medicine Indiana University Institute Personalized Medicine collaboration Eskenazi Indiana University Health Systems evaluate economic clinical outcome associate embed pharmacogenomics program system serve primary health care safety-net Indianapolis , Indiana . By successfully implement pharmacogenomics program integrate Electronic Health Record Clinical Decision Support system , physicians able optimize patient care deliver tailor therapeutic decision base patient 's individual genetics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Indiana University School Medicine Indiana University Institute Personalized Medicine collaboration Eskenazi Health IUH Systems conduct NIH fund randomized trial beginning 2014 . The study evaluate economic clinical outcome associate embed pharmacogenomics program system serve health care safety-net Indianapolis , Indiana , handle 1.2 million outpatient visit year hospital network 10 community health center . There 990,000 outpatient visit 15,000 adult admission annually , payor mix include 45 % uninsured , 26 % Medicaid 18 % Medicare patient . This health care system 40 year experience digital medical record implementation proven track record innovation medical informatics base Regenstrief Institute . The goal Personalized Medicine ( PM ) implement advance biomarker pharmacology , molecular diagnostics genomics improve health patient afflict wide range medical condition . Dramatic advance genomics identify numerous disease/therapeutic association place goal within sight . For full benefit personalize genomic medicine realize , critical progress make small scale extend . The fruit outstanding scientific discovery often enjoy small number academic medical center scalable , therefore available mass patient find large health care system . In addition , advance often bypass underserved population , result significant inequality care . Study Aims : Aim 1 : To test hypothesis Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certify genotyping target 24 widely use drug associate significant reduction hospital outpatient economic cost incur 1 year . Aim2 : To test whether pharmacogenetic testing associate significant improvement clinical outcome 1 year . The INGENIOUS trial enroll total 6,000 patient , 2,000 patient assign pharmacogenetic test arm 4,000 control arm follow , test . The study prospective since practice pattern change , retrospective design use assess impact prospective change . It randomize intervention arm one receive intervention order genotyped group compare one undisturbed , routine clinical care carry patient take drug . Both arm follow year . Subjects enrol start 6 month funding period , investigator enroll subject total 2 year , last person enrol 2.5 year , follow complete 3.5 year , allow 6 month analysis end study . A pharmacogenetic test , involve 51 Single nucleotide polymorphisms 16 gene carry begin study patient test arm upon prompt index medication : one 24 select support validated guideline .</detailed_description>
