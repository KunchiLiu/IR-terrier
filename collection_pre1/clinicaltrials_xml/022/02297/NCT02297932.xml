	<brief_summary>Physical activity exercise intervention multiple sclerosis ( MS ) receive great attention recently exist several randomized clinical trial ( RCTs ) address outcomes associate intervention . The majority intervention primarily focus directly influence disease process ( e.g. , inflammation , neurotrophic factor ) , reduction symptom ( e.g. , fatigue , depression ) , improvement physical functioning ( e.g. , gait , strength ) enhance one 's quality life . To date , evidence suggests exercise intervention MS hold anywhere minimal great promise depend outcome interest . For outcomes depression cognition , finding even less optimistic , null , inconsistent , best . These inconsistent finding may attribute methodological issue use subjective report , lack appropriate control group , poor compliance , sample selection . The propose investigation aim address issue : ( 1 ) Obtaining objective measure outcomes interest ( i.e. , fatigue , cognition , participation/activities daily live [ ADLs ] ) ; ( 2 ) assess certain person-specific factor ( e.g. , personality ) intermediary factor may influence physical activity indirectly result improved outcome ( e.g. , improvement sleep subsequent improvement fatigue and/or cognition ) . Thus , primary objective propose investigation : ( 1 ) utilize innovative objective measure outcomes ; ( 2 ) obtain comprehensive assessment intermediary variable ( e.g. , sleep ) person-specific characteristic ( e.g. , personality ) , together may explain inconsistent finding literature follow specific aim : To achieve goal , individual complete comprehensive assessment cognition , person-specific factor , intermediary factor , physical fitness , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) prior follow home base exercise intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Specific Aims Specific Aim 1 : Utilize innovative objective measures/techniques ( i.e. , brain imaging , structure clinical interview , performance base assessment functional activity ) examine effect physical activity fatigue , cognition , participation/activities daily live ( ADLs ) . Specific Aim 2 : Obtain preliminary data identify factor may explain inconsistency literature pertain effect physical activity fatigue , cognition , participation/ADLs . Specifically , intermediary factor may include sleep quality , depression , pain , self-efficacy , may affect intervention subsequently influence outcome . Other potential factor independent intervention may include person-specific , baseline characteristic personality , trait anxiety , motivation , health belief engagement health-related behavior , certain demographic disease variable ( e.g. , age ) . Procedures . Subjects randomly assign either strength training stretch group base priori randomization scheme . All participant complete pre post assessment consist subjective objective measure fatigue , cognition , &amp; participation/ADLs ( Per Specific Aim 1 ) . Additionally baseline physical functioning measure include . Fatigue Measures : Briefly , image data study obtain use 3.0 T Siemens Allegra scanner . The following anatomical image obtain : MPRAGE localizer . fMRI perform performance cognitively fatigue task ( Modified SDMT [ mSDMT ] ) subject ask throughout task report scale 0-100 cognitively fatigue feel `` right , moment . '' These rating use amplitude modulate regressor determine brain increase fatigue associate increased brain activity . Once neural network identify , compare activation observe follow intervention . Intervention . The intervention consist Home-based Resistance Training Intervention . Participants randomize home-based progressive resistance training ( PRT ) condition provide train manual , exercise log book , resistance training equipment . The training manual consist detailed description exercise perform progress 6-months . The exercise logbook allow participant provide detailed record training session . Home-based PRT equipment consist elastic band ( Thera-BandÂ® , Hygenic Corporation , Akron , OH ) weight vest . This equipment use successfully supervised home-based PRT intervention improve strength , function , health-related outcome clinical population , particularly old adult . Participants involve initial training session Kessler Foundation ( KF ) learn perform exercise program include demonstration practice exercise technique , use train equipment , monitor record training progress . Four follow-up visit KF occur throughout 4-month program provide participant individualized feedback training progression . The home-based PRT program base American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) guideline prescription resistance training , well previous PRT program person MS . This prescription consistent recently develop evidence-based guideline physical activity person MS . The prescription consist 3 weekly session 1-3 set , 8-12 repetition 10 exercise target low body , upper body , core muscle group . The 10 exercise include lunge , chair raises/squats , calf raise , knee flexion , knee extension , shoulder row , shoulder lateral raise , elbow flexion , elbow extension , abdominal curl . The intensity training program prescribe base type color elastic band use amount weight weight vest , base previous study use modalities.Five color elastic band use vary level resistance difficulty ( i.e. , yellow &lt; red &lt; green &lt; blue &lt; black ) . Participants begin yellow band progress follow describe color band progression . The amount weight add weighted vest determine percent individual 's body weight . The initial weight vest set 0.5 % body weight . Vest weight progression occur add 0.5 1.5 % body weight every 2 week first 12 week program . During second half program , vest weight progression occur add 0.05 1.0 % body weight every 2 week . At follow-up training session , body weight re-assessed ensure accurate training progression . Other progression throughout program include increase number set repetition , increase level difficulty exercise ( e.g. , change exercise position sit stand ) . Individualized feedback progress program provide one-on-one phone chat session . This provide participant opportunity modify adapt goal progress program ultimate goal develop skill necessary independently monitor change behavior . The behavioral content deliver text-based material one-on-one phone chat sessions member research team involve outcome assessment . Text-based material provide initial training session include train manual , exercise log book , information self-monitoring setting goal PRT program . Comparison Group . Individuals stretch condition participate four month home-based stretch program develop National Multiple Sclerosis Society ( NMSS ) . They provide text-based material ask provide weekly log book . In effort equate attention receive , individual come KF frequency receive PRT intervention also engage number chat sessions assess adherence program .</detailed_description>
