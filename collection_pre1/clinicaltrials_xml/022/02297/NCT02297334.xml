	<brief_summary>The aim study prove use CytoSorb ( TM ) filter cardiopulmonary circuit attenuate inflammatory response extracorporeal circulation patient undergoing cardiac surgery . The hypothesis remove cytokine patient ' blood CytoSorb device significantly improve circulation outcome patient undergo on-pump cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Removal Cytokines During Extracorporeal Circulation Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) induce inflammatory response due contact patient ' blood foreign surface like tube oxygenator , ischemic-reperfusion injury surgical trauma . Inflammation modulate cytokine , especially , interleukin . The extent cytokine release related duration bypass amount operate field suction . This result systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) risk multiple organ dysfunction ( MOD ) . Also patient treat extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) activation inflammation system see accompanied increase cytokine level . The cytokine concentration correlate severity immune reaction predictor outcome patient . As severe SIRS MOD significantly increase mortality , attenuation inflammatory response suppose reduce morbidity mortality cardiac surgery . For adult cardiac surgery patient treat extracorporal assist device , tool cytokine elimination attenuation inflammatory response seem beneficial . In study go investigate use CytoSorb device improve outcome patient undergo elective coronar artery bypass heart valve surgery .</detailed_description>
