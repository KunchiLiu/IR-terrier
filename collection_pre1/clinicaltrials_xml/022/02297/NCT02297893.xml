	<brief_summary>Background aim : Patients Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) exhibit disturbed manual dexterity . This impairment lead difficulty activity daily live ( ADL ) button T-shirt hand-writing . The aim present research project investigate effectiveness high intensity home base exercise intervention focus fine motor skill ( HOMEDEXT ) , patient PD . Design : A single blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) perform . Randomization do independent biostatistician use computerized randomization protocol . A baseline assessment follow-up measurement 4 week immediately intervention ( end rehabilitation ) perform . A follow-up measurement , 12 week later , do assess long-lasting effect . Assessments perform investigator blind intervention . Participants : One hundred four out-patients PD recruit report specific difficulty manual dexterity execute ADL . Intervention : The patient allocate either intervention group ( n = 52 ) control group ( n = 52 ) . In intervention group PD patient exercise , period four week , once/day 30 minute treatment specific exercise dexterity . The PD patient , allocate control group , exercise Theraband exercise . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure manual dexterity Nine Hole Peg test . Secondary outcome measure Coin Rotation task , sensitive screening dexterity . Furthermore ADL modify version subscale II Movement Disorders Society unify Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS-UPDRS ) use . Parkinsonian symptom assess MDS-UPDRS subscale III . To assess improvement quality life modify version Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ-39 ) use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder affect motor non-motor basal ganglion circuitry ( Stern et al. , 2012 ) . The degeneration dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra lead clinical manifestation cardinal motor feature PD : bradykinesia , muscle rigidity , tremor rest impairment postural reflex ( Bohlhalter &amp; KÃ¤gi , 2011 ) . While dopaminergic therapy improve symptom PD , symptom , impaired finger dexterity , may less responsive pharmacological treatment ( Quencer et al. , 2007 ; Gebhardt et al. , 2008 ) . Patients PD often report difficulty activity daily live ( ADL ) , fasten T-shirt button tie shoe lace , activity require dexterous skill ( Peto et al. , 2001 ; Nijkrake et al. , 2009 ) . The exact mechanisms loss finger dexterity know . Elementary motor deficit bradykinesia ( Agostino et al. , 2003 ) , reduce strength finger torque production ( Fellows et al. , 1998 ; de Oliveira et al. , 2008 ) certainly play role . However , deficit fully account motor impairment suggest apraxic disorder call limb kinetic apraxia , may significantly contribute dexterous deficit observe PD ( Quencer et al. , 2007 ; Gebhardt et al . 2008 ; Vanbellingen et al. , 2011 , 2012 ) . Only limited data exist therapeutic intervention dexterous problem PD ( Dixon et al. , 2007 ; Rao , 2010 ) . However , increase evidence ally health care , include physical therapy ( PT ) , speech-language therapy occupational therapy ( OT ) , may complement standard pharmacological surgical treatment ( Van der Marck et al. , 2009 ) . These therapy aim minimize impact disease process , improve patient 's participation ADL . Two major treatment approach commonly use PD : movement strategy train muskuloskeletal exercise ( Morris et al. , 2009 ) . By use movement strategy , patient PD may bypass defective basal ganglion , engage alternative neural circuit still intact ( frontal parietal cortical pathway ) . Examples mental rehearse focus attention ( Morris et al. , 2009 ) use sensory cue initiate maintain movement ( Nieuwboer et al . 2007 ) . However , disadvantage treatment approach , particularly recruitment frontal cortex , dependence preserve cognitive ability . As disease progress , many patient PD eventually develop cognitive impairment ( Aarsland et al. , 2010 ) , could negatively influence learn movement strategy ( Nieuwboer et al. , 2009 ) . Musculoskeletal exercise aim improve strength , joint range movement , muscle length endurance ( Trend et al . 2002 ) . High intensity exercise program successful show either short long-term effect balance gait patient PD ( Hirsch et al. , 2003 ; Morris et al. , 2009 ; Ebersbach et al. , 2010 ) , train mode consistent principle promote activity-dependent neuroplasticity ( Petzinger et al . 2010 ) . Activity-dependent neuroplasticity define modification within central nervous system , response physical activity promotes skill acquisition process ( Adkins et al. , 2006 ) . As intensity , specificity , difficulty ; complexity practice appear important parameter drive neuroplasticity potential lasting effect brain behavior ( Petzinger et al . 2010 ) . In contrast significant short long-term improvement find high intensity train gait balance ( Hirsch et al. , 2003 ; Morris et al. , 2009 ; Ebersbach et al. , 2010 ) , little evidence fine motor skill patient PD ( Gauthier et al. , 1987 ) . However , well-designed study conduct , far , focused aspect motor skill PD . Until date well design trial performed , patient PD , investigate whether high intensity exercise program , focus fine motor skill , could improve dexterous skill . As described , patient PD often experience impaired dexterity lead significant disability several ADL , contribute reduce quality life . For gait balance disorder , high intensity training program show successful patient PD , base training mode drive activity-dependent plasticity . However , question remain open whether high intensity exercise program , focus fine motor skill , could effective well patient PD . The aims present project ass outcomes high intensity exercise intervention , focus fine motor skill , in-patients PD . The short long-term benefit train program compare conventional training , patient already receive hospital stay . For purpose , single blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) perform . Based literature hypothesize specific home base dexterity program ( HOMEDEXT ) improve fine motor skill short term long-term , detected primary outcome measurement nine-hole peg test ( Earhart et al . 2011 ) . The improved finger hand function also lead improve ADL function assess modify version subscale II Movement Disorders Society unify Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS-UPDRS ) ( Goetz et al. , 2008 ) . Furthermore , expect patient PD report high quality life ( QoL ) , assess secondary outcome measure , modify version Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ-39 ) ( Peto et al. , 2001 ) .</detailed_description>
