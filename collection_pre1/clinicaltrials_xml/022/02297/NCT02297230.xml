Woman childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline . Woman childbearing potential use reliable appropriate contraceptive method . ( Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Patient agree continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration . Serious concurrent infection . Clinically significant cardiac disease well control medication ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . Patients organ allograft . Patients severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 mL/min [ Cockcroft Gault43 ] ) . In patient moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 3050 mL/min [ Cockcroft Gault43 ] ) baseline , dose reduction 75 % XELODA start dose recommend . In patient mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 5180 mL/min ) adjustment start dose recommend . In phase I study , abnormal renal function , since toxicity likely affect presence significant renal dysfunction .
