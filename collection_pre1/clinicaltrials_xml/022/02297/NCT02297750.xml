	<brief_title>Optimal Timing Double-Wire Technique For Biliary Cannulation ERCP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sometimes , course regular ERCP procedure , technique use doctor pas wire bile duct result pancreas duct enter instead . When happen , doctor may either remove wire ( know `` single wire '' technique ) leave use second wire ( `` double wire '' ) enter bile duct . This study try determine whether `` double wire '' technique `` single wire '' technique remove wire safe efficient .</detailed_description>
