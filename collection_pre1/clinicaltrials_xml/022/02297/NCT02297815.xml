	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Antibiotics Respiratory Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatient , ARTIs account vast majority antibiotic exposure child , roughly half antibiotic prescription inappropriate . Although unnecessary antibiotic prescribe viral infection significantly decrease , substantial increase prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotic treat ARTIs narrow-spectrum antibiotic indicate . Primary care provider , patient , caregiver would benefit study assess implication alternate antibiotic regimen common infection . Specifically , remain unclear treat common ARTIs broad-spectrum antibiotic lead improvement patient outcome compare treatment narrow-spectrum antibiotic , particularly consider increase threat pose antimicrobial resistance . Because lack large comparative effectiveness study patient-centered outcome address issue , professional guideline expert recommendation conflict , , result , practice pattern vary considerably . Furthermore , adverse effect antibiotic use clearly define quantified child . Therefore , use patient-centered outcome , aim : 1 ) compare treatment failure rate 2 ) compare rate adverse drug effect narrow-spectrum broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment common ARTIs child . To accomplish , perform prospective cohort study child receive antibiotic ARTI across comprehensive pediatric healthcare network . Outcomes include clinical treatment failure adverse drug effect identify 1 ) return primary care , emergency department visit , hospitalization new antibiotic prescription and/or ARTI complication 2 ) parent/caregiver assessment clinical improvement adverse drug effect . Comparing patient-specific outcome different antibiotic regimen ARTIs help inform treat clinician parent risk benefit associate management common condition .</detailed_description>
