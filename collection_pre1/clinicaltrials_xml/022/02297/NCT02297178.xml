Cystoscopy urethral dilatation long advocate empirical treatment woman low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . A review literature reveals mark lack evidence regard survey practice amongst UK urologists find 61 % performed urethral dilatation 7 time year survey conduct , although 55 % believe less half patient experience long term improvement ( Masarani Willis , 2006 ) The original study show benefit urethral dilatation versus dilatation 6 month follow ( Duckett 2007 ) .
