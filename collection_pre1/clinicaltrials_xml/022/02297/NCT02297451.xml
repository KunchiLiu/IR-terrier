	<brief_summary>Background : Arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) form vascular access haemodialysis . An AVF normally create level wrist , occasionally create elbow suitable vessel forearm . The common type elbow ( antecubital ) fistula ( AFF ) brachiocephalic fistula , carry significantly high risk steal syndrome ( AVF-associated hand ischaemia ) wrist fistula . More recently , AFF use proximal radial ulnar artery inflow describe show low rate Steal syndrome brachiocephalic fistula . This study aim investigate incidence steal syndrome AFF use brachial artery use proximal radial/ulnar artery inflow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) safe form vascular access long-term haemodialysis patient end-stage renal failure . The strategy create AVF upper limb start distal site fails , attempt AVF proximal site i.e . wrist , forearm elbow . The common type AVF radiocephalic AVF wrist . A proximal AVF often create primary procedure poor vasculature distal forearm secondary procedure wrist fistula fail . Traditionally , brachiocephalic fistula ( BCF ) , involve anastomose cephalic vein brachial artery , common type AVF create antecubital fossa elbow level . Other common type antecubital fossa arteriovenous fistula ( AFF ) brachiobasilic ( BBF ) brachio-median cubital AVF . Steal syndrome relates hand ischaemia associate AVF creation , major risk AVF formation . The symptom steal syndrome range cold extremity , numbness , hand claudication ( pain exercise ) , rest pain tissue loss . Steal syndrome also measure Digital Brachial Pressure Index . Severe steal syndrome debilitating , limb-threatening , require surgical revision ligation AVF . This lead additional surgical risk loss dialysis vascular access . Diabetes type AVF find independent risk factor develop steal syndrome follow AVF creation1 . The high risk see patient proximal AVF i.e . BCF/BBF ; 50 % patient study , compare 5-8 % upper limb AVFs . An alternative technique may reduce risk steal group patient anastomose vein radial artery ulnar artery , distal brachial artery bifurcation . This technique , theoretically , 'steal ' blood one artery e.g . radial artery anastomosis create proximal radial artery blood flow therefore maintain ulnar arterial system . Recent study suggest use proximal radial ulnar artery reduce risk steal low 0 % 3 % . The type arterial inflow AFF therefore potentially significant factor cause steal syndrome . There , however , current randomise controlled trial prove hypothesis . The definition steal syndrome varies greatly literature . Some study define steal syndrome presence mild symptom cold hand , others report steal syndrome severe enough require surgical intervention . This lead huge variation incidence steal syndrome report make comparison difficult study . A score system describe severity steal syndrome suggest previous study , none widely use . In study , difference severity steal two intervention group investigate . This do use Hoek score , originally use Hoek et al 2006 report steal syndrome associate AVFs create centre . There , however , comparison score among different type AVF .</detailed_description>
