	<brief_title>Partial Breast Irradiation Using Interstitial Permanent Palladium-103 Seed Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25 woman low stage ( pT1pN0 ) breast cancer , grade 1 2 , accrue adjuvant partial breast radiotherapy use PBSI prospectively follow 5 year . The primary aim evaluate implant quality accord recognize dosimetric parameter . Secondary aim include elaboration approach different technical scenario impose variation seroma size , shape location within breast ( expand technical manual include recommend approaches implant different sector breast different size breast ) , incorporation use live 3D ultrasound procedure ( opposed current use 2D US ) , assessment patient acceptance quality life , physician assessment cosmesis , assessment toxicity , record cost patient health care system compare alternate form breast radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient consent signature approve consent form . Age great 55 year postmenopausal . Life expectancy least ten year Stage 0 I breast cancer . Tumour size &lt; 2 cm . Invasive cancer must pathologic grade 1 2 Histology must either Ductal Carcinoma In Situ invasive ductal adenocarcinoma breast . Tumour remove lumpectomy clear margin ( DCIS invasive ) . Unifocal disease For invasive breast cancer , axillary stag either sentinel node biopsy axillary dissection ( minimum 6 axillary node ) . Not required DCIS . Brachytherapy generally perform within 16 week last surgery ( lumpectomy , reexcision margin , axillary staging procedure ) . If &gt; 16 week , assess casebycase basis , base seroma visibility presence surgical clip tumour bed . Tumour must Estrogen Receptor positive . The lumpectomy cavity ( seroma ) must clearly delineate ultrasound CT &lt; 3 cm diameter ( equivalent sphere ) result maximum 125 cc planning target volume ( PTV ) . Breast seed implant must consider technically deliverable interstitial brachytherapy attend radiation oncologist must minimum 2plane implant . If prior nonbreast malignancy , must diseasefree 5 year . Time limit waive carcinoma insitu cervix colon , melanoma insitu , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Stage T2 high breast cancer Histologically positive axillary node . High grade ( grade 3 ) invasive ductal carcinoma Extensive DCIS Lymphatic Vascular Invasion positive Significant persistent post surgical complication Palpable radiographically suspicious ipsilateral contralateral axillary , regional node , unless histologically confirm negative . Suspicious microcalcifications , density , palpable abnormality ipsilateral contralateral breast unless confirm benign . Proven multicentric carcinoma ( invasive cancer DCIS ) Paget 's disease nipple . Synchronous bilateral invasive noninvasive breast cancer . History previous ipsilateral invasive breast cancer DCIS . Surgical margin positive microscopically assess . Clear delineation target lumpectomy cavity possible . Breast implant . Prior ipsilateral breast thoracic radiotherapy .
