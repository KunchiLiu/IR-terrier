	<brief_title>Effects Metyrapone Patients With Endogenous Cushing 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include Cushing disease patient persistent recurrent disease ( pituitary surgery ) newly diagnose unsuitable early surgery wish defer surgery . It also include patient ectopic ACTH syndrome ( either occult , surgery failure , inoperable metastatic ) patient Cushing 's syndrome adrenal cause . The ability metyrapone normalize urinary free cortisol level assess 36 week ( 9 month ) treatment . Patients participate study control close target end 3-months period may continue optional extension period 6 month long-term efficacy safety profile metyrapone assess . This extension study intend provide new finding consolidate exist efficacy safety data metyrapone treatment Cushing 's syndrome .</detailed_description>
