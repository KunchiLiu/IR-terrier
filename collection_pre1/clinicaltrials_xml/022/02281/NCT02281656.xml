	<brief_summary>Ulnar nerve compression elbow common problem significantly affect hand function severe case . The current , standard treatment Ulnar nerve decompression without transposition ( move ulnar nerve site less compression ) . In severe compression , clinical result surgery typically poor . Distal transfer function nerve ( level wrist ) compress ulnar nerve ( anterior interosseous nerve ulnar motor fascicle ) suggest `` supercharge '' augment hand muscle nerve axon regenerate level elbow decompression/transposition . In fact , treatment become widely adopt without clear evidence change outcomes . The investigator propose prospectively compare effectiveness ulnar nerve decompression/transposition versus decompression/transposition distal nerve transfer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Reverse End Side Anterior Interosseous Nerve Ulnar Nerve Transfer Severe Compressive Ulnar Neuropathy Elbow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study prospectively compare outcome patient severe ( intrinsic hand muscle dysfunction ) compressive ulnar neuropathy elbow treat ulnar nerve decompression subcutaneous transposition alone versus ulnar nerve decompression subcutaneous transposition AIN ulnar nerve reverse end-to-side transfer . The study objective project follow : 1 . To prospectively compare clinical outcome patient severe ulnar neuropathy elbow receive ulnar nerve decompression subcutaneous transposition AIN ulnar motor reverse end-to-side nerve transfer versus decompression subcutaneous transposition alone . 2 . To prospectively compare electrophysiologic outcome ( nerve conduction study EMG ) patient severe ulnar neuropathy elbow receive ulnar nerve decompression subcutaneous transposition AIN ulnar motor reverse end-to-side nerve transfer versus decompression subcutaneous transposition alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient ( great 18 year ) severe compressive ulnar nerve neuropathy ( McGowan grade III ) elbow consent either ulnar nerve decompression transposition alone ulnar nerve decompression transposition plus nerve transfer . Patients age 18 70 . Patients ulnar neuropathy multiple anatomic location along course nerve . Patients mild moderate ulnar neuropathy ( McGowan grade I II ) .</criteria>
