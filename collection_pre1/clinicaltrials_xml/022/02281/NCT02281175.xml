	<detailed_description>Benzodiazepines ( BZD ) represent frequently consume drug elderly person Canada . Indeed , 7.5 time BZD user older people ( 65 year ) adult ( 18-64 year ) . Importantly , 50 % senior receive prescription BZD display severe psychiatric symptom physically good health . Results survey include 2811 community-dwelling older adult ( 65 year ) show 32 % respondent consume BZD average 205 day 60 % least received one potentially inappropriate prescription period ( e.g . prescription BZD long half-life prescription 2 BZD 6 consecutive week , etc. ) . Another study show 45 % new BZD user take drug 30 day . It note definition long-term BZD use varies three four month consumption , correspond average period use almost senior . Long-term use BZD old people complex phenomenon explain several personal , psychological , social factor interact . Systemic model BZD consumption late-life implies follow five element contribute initiate maintain BZD taking : 1 ) history ( i.e . autonomy loss , stress , disease apparition , etc . ) ; 2 ) prescription process ; 3 ) personal disposition ( i.e . sexe , age , education , loneliness , etc . ) ; 4 ) sociocultural factor ( i.e . positive attitude family physician toward BZD use ) ; 5 ) cognitive strategy ( e.g . trivialization concern drug , etc. ) . To researcher 's knowledge , randomize control clinical trial test effectiveness non-pharmacological intervention patient mean age 60 year old . Data study show brief intervention ( e.g . receive either informative leaflet BZD withdrawal meeting doctor informative letter post mail ) psychological intervention ( include cognitive behavioral therapy CBT ) likely effective standard care case , gradual dose reduction ( GDR ) supervise physician . However , 10 % ( brief intervention ) 85 % ( cognitive behavioral therapy design treat insomnia ) participant completely stop BZD use end treatment . Furthermore , Parr colleague indicate complete stop BZD consumption remain difficult still big challenge patient , clinicians researcher . Nevertheless , one limitations study large variation age participant ( range 18 85 year , despite mean age 60 year ) , thus restrict generalization finding old patient . Moreover , result derive efficacy study ( vs effectiveness study ) design improve internal validity expense external validity . Although result demonstrate potential efficacy ( vs effectiveness ) non-pharmacological treatment facilitate BZD withdrawal , elderly user receive intervention due lack resource , expertise time simply due expensive implementation cost . Finally , investigator 's knowledge , psychosocial intervention base cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) include specific personal , psychological , social component associate age , target old people different psychological problem ( i.e . insomnia also anxiety depression ) test . Therefore , researcher hypothesize `` Programme d'Aide au Succ√®s du SEvrage ( PASSE-65+ ) '' could suitable effective help old people BZD withdrawal management . In order answer investigator 's hypothesis , long-term old user BZD first receive clinical assessment determine whether meet research criterion . The participant ( n=75 ) randomly allocate one follow three group : one group receive informative document ( describe step gradual self-weaning ) , second receive informative document 30 minute meet physician week , third group receive informative document , meet physician week receive psychosocial intervention ( PASSE-65+ ) . It noteworthy psychosocial intervention also offer first 2 group end study . The research study conduct 12 week-period first 2 group . For third group , intervention offer 12 session 16 week-period . All group undergo three additional assessment ( 2 14 day , 3 month 12 month ) follow end intervention . These last assessment aim measure rate relapse , withdrawal symptom , intensity anxious depressive symptom , sleep quality participant . Finally , 15 participant randomly choose divide 3 group ( n=5 ) : One group constitute BZD user completely stop take drug , second one BZD user diminish consumption third one participant relapse drop . All participant group interview home collect opinion PASSE-65+ program .</detailed_description>
