	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics , Efficacy , Safety Human Plasma-Derived Fibrinogen ( FIB Grifols ) Patients With Congenital Afibrinogenaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase I-II , multi-center , prospective , open-label , single-arm , clinical trial evaluate PK , efficacy , safety human plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols adult pediatric patient congenital afibrinogenaemia . Approximately 10adult subject ( ≥ 18 year ) congenital afibrinogenaemia administer single dose study drug 70 mg/kg body weight . follow PK , efficacy , safety assessment . After safety fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols assess least 10 adult subject safety issue raise sponsor , study start enroll approximately 10 pediatric subject dose study drug follow PK , efficacy , safety assessment . All enrolled subject ( adult pediatrics ) document congenital fibrinogen deficiency manifest afibrinogenaemia receive fibrinogen-containing product therapy within precede 21 day infusion study drug . All subject ( adult pediatrics ) infuse investigational product 70 mg/kg body weight . PK parameter calculate plasma fibrinogen level measure different time point ] include : vivo recovery [ IVR ] , area curve ( AUC ) calculate AUC zero 14 day ( AUC0-14days ) AUC zero infinity ( AUC0-∞ ) , maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , time observe maximum plasma concentration ( tmax ) , half-life ( t1/2 ) , mean residence time ( MRT ) , volume distribution ( Vd ) , clearance ( Cl ) . Hemostatic efficacy investigational product assess mean thromboelastographic measure Maximum Clot Firmness ( MCF ) baseline one-hour post-infusion . Other thromboelastographic measure well standard coagulation test also determine pre- post-infusion . Clinical safety , viral safety , immunogenicity assess clinical trial . Safety variable include adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , physical assessment , laboratory test , viral marker , antibody human fibrinogen . A monitoring plan implement sponsor carefully monitor evaluate allergic/hypersensitivity reaction thrombotic event ( TE ) study . Stopping criterion establish immunogenic thrombogenic event . If single case event report subject dosed study drug , enrollment dose subject study suspend event adequately assess sponsor . The enrollment dose reassume sponsor deem safe .</detailed_description>

Female subject childbearing potential must negative test pregnancy serum urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCGbased assay ) baseline ( sample drawn within 24 hour prior infusion Day 0visit ) 6 . Female subject childbearing potential agree practice contraception use method proven reliability ( i.e. , hormonal method ; barrier method ; intrauterine device method , abstinence ) prevent pregnancy course clinical trial 7 . Subjects must willing comply aspect clinical trial protocol , include blood sampling , whole duration study Women childbearing potential include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilisation ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( postmenopausal define amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive month woman hormone replacement therapy document serum follicle stimulate hormone level &lt; 35 mIU/mL ) . Even woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile , e.g . vasectomy , consider child bear potential 1 .
