	<detailed_description>Anticoagulation one support pillar chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) ( 1 ) . The optimal anticoagulant regimen provide full anticoagulation extracorporeal circuit minimal systemic effect come affordable cost . Unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) standard care many year . In several country , UFH gradually replace low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) . LMWH easy use administer bolus injection reduce membrane fibrin platelet deposition ( 2,1 ) . Both UFH LMWH provide adequate anticoagulation extracorporeal circuit , price systemic anticoagulation . Apart bleeding , administration unfractionated heparin also associate dyslipidemia , hypoaldosteronism hyperkalemia , thrombopenia , osteoporosis , pruritus , hypersensitivity reaction . Several alternative anticoagulation regimen propose include heparin coat dialyzer membrane regional citrate anticoagulation . Regional citrate anticoagulation perform infuse citrate arterial line dialysis tube reduce ionized calcium concentration low level ( 4,1 ) . Ionized calcium concentration restore calcium supplementation prior reinfusion blood patient . Most often , calcium repletion calcium infusion venous line . Alternatively , conventional calcium contain dialysate restore calcium concentration , although anticoagulant effect blunt venous line , give acceptable result ( 5 ) . A previous study suggest regional citrate anticoagulation superior heparin-coated polyacrylonitrile dialyzer ( AN69ST ; Nephral 300ST , Gambro ) result significantly great instantaneous urea nitrogen clearance ( 3 ) . While generally safe adequate , regional citrate anticoagulation require additional action preparatory phase ( preparation citrate calcium infusion pump ) well treatment ( measurement ionize calcium ) . These additional action result additional cost . Recently , acetate-free citrate-containing dialysate concentrate introduce clinical practice . Besides advantage acetate-free dialysate , provide modest local anticoagulant effect inside dialyzer . Citrate-containing dialysate allow reduce heparin dose maintain extracorporeal circuit patency dialyzer clearance ( 6 ) . The investigator question whether combination citrate-containing dialysate heparin-coated dialyzer membrane equally effective conventional regional citrate anticoagulation .</detailed_description>
