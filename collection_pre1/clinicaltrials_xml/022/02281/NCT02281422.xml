	<brief_title>An Open-label , Single-dose , Single-centre Study , Investigating Pharmacokinetics BIA 2-093</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-dose ( BIA 2-093 800 mg tablet ) , single-centre study five group subject various degree renal function base creatinine clearance ( stag renal function accord Food Drug Administration European Agency Evaluation Medicinal Products Guidelines ) evaluation pharmacokinetics patient impaired renal function . The trial commence Groups 1 2 . An interim safety evaluation conduct , safety concern , trial continue Groups 3 4 . After another interim safety evaluation data Groups 3 4 , trial commence Group 5 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female least 18 year age , body mass le 50 kg . Female subject postmenopausal , surgically sterilize use reliable method contraception . Subjects suffer chronic illness , hepatic impairment , stable condition , regard investigator unlikely influence outcome study . Renal failure , extent , measure creatinine clearance , result recruitment one five renal function group . Medical record indicate stable serum creatinine ( variation 30 % ) , least 3 month prior screen visit ( Groups 2 4 ) , determine clinical investigator . The s√©rum creatinine stable allow accurate determination creatinine clearance therefore allow correct allocation one renal function group . Subjects recruit Group 1 normal renal function . The receipt investigational drug within 30 day prior study . Clinically significant abnormal finding ( judged investigator ) follow parameter , except consistent finding renal failure : haematology , biochemistry , clot profile , urinalysis , vital sign ECG screen test . A history laboratory evidence hepatic impairment and/or disease . Owing metabolic pathway BIA 2093 , degree hepatic impairment would confound effect PK analysis . Positive test HIV1 HIV2 Antibodies , Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C Antibodies . HIV positive patient , patient Hepatitis B C , generally average , case markedly decrease , level health owe nature respective infection natural course disease , often complicate array opportunistic illness . Their ill health would worsen fact patient invarious degree renal failure , , often debilitate , complication . If patient HIV Hepatitis B C include study , could lead statistical confusion assess safety tolerability parameter . This event report patient , may part spectrum complaint HIV positive patient Hepatitis B C patient , would confound safety tolerability analysis . Furthermore , Hepatitis B C , may cause element hepatic impairment , would confound PK analysis due metabolic pathway BIA 2093 . In addition , administer study medication subject , adverse event might occur would add discomfort patient . A history illness , opinion Investigator and/or Sponsor , might confound result .</criteria>
