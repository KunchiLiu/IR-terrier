	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia bipolar disorder major public health problem . The second generation anti-psychotic drug efficacy positive negative symptom favorable risk profile far movement disorder . However , drug associate clinically significant weight gain metabolic effect . The underlying mechanisms side effect unclear , however preliminary study schizophrenic patient atypical anti-psychotic drug , find weight gain vitamin D deficiency present 50 % population . Given considerable heterogeneity among patient atypical anti-psychotics potential weight gain vitamin D-deficient state , propose patient schizophrenia gain weight atypical antipsychotic medication vitamin D-deficient . This hypothesis test patient schizophrenia receive second-generation anti-psychotic drug minimum duration 4 month . Specific Aim : We predict patient schizophrenia , gain weight antipsychotic treatment , vitamin D-deficient compare patient gain weight . We examine circulate level serum 25 ( OH ) D , mRNA transcript protein expression vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) enzymes , CYP24A CYP27B , white blood cell subject correlate BMI blood level leptin adiponectin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Vitamin D Atypical Antipsychotic-induced Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : We predict patient schizophrenia , gain weight antipsychotic treatment , vitamin D-deficient compare patient gain weight . We examine circulate level serum 25 ( OH ) D , mRNA transcript protein expression vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) enzymes , CYP24A CYP27B , white blood cell subject correlate BMI blood level leptin adiponectin . Experimental Approach : Recruitment Patients : Subjects recruit psychiatry clinic Alegent-Creighton Clinics PI work full-time basis . Dr. Selvaraj , PI project , provide psychiatric care annually average 300 patient schizophrenia bipolar disorder . In addition , psychiatrists clinic also see patient schizophrenia . Thus , ample population available study . The patient recruit base inclusion exclusion criterion , show Figure 1 . Patients schizophrenia atypical antipsychotic , quetiapine , recruit . The underlie major mechanism action anti-psychotic medication block dopamine ( D2 D4 ) serotonin ( 5-HT2A 5-HT2c ) receptor ( 24 ) . Also , antipsychotic medication show increase weight patient . According data , mean increase weight 8-10 week anti-psychotics 12.2 lbs quetiapine ( 24 ) . In case , increase weight reach plateau within 8-10 week ( 24 ) . Therefore , recruit age-matched patient take quetiapine 100mg least 12 week . There relationship weight gain severity psychosis dose anti-psychotic drug . During first episode , patient 20 30 . The patient divide two experimental group : ( ) `` Weight gain '' ( ii ) `` No weight gain '' . In weight gain group , recruit patient gain 10 % increase baseline weight . In weight group , recruit patient lose weight , gain weight gain weight &lt; 5 % baseline weight . The baseline weight data information obtain electronic health record EPICS system , upon recruitment study . The human research protocol Informed Consent HIPPA form approve Institutional Review Board Creighton University . Statistical Analysis : The association weight gain vitamin D deficiency analyze use 2x2 contingency table test independence . The three common test independence likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) , Pearson 's chi-square statistic , Fisher 's exact test . Both Pearson 's chi-square Fisher 's exact test use analyze data . If expect number count one cell less five ( 5 ) , Fisher 's exact test report . The purpose pilot estimate/confirm reasonable confidence interval true odds ratio reference proportion design large scale study . We believe reasonably recruit 30 40 patient . Should recruit total 40 patient , believe achieve minimum detectable odds ratio 9 ( desire power 0.80 significance level 0.05 ) reference proportion 0.35 . This initial analysis base preliminary study 35 % schizophrenic patient gain weight atypical antipsychotic drug . Since follow patient , collection blood clinical data one time point , question potential drop-outs follow-ups arise . Age-matched subject sex ethnicity participate study . Potential subject approach treat clinician ( inpatient outpatient ) possible participation ; potential study participant may respond advertisement form IRB approve flyer distribute area hospital medical clinic . Patients indicate interest study ask sign inform consent allow research personnel review clinical record speak PI treat physician appropriateness protocol participation . In Alegent-Creighton clinic sufficient number minority patient , include African-Americans , Hispanics woman . No child recruit study . Experimental Protocol : Upon recruitment subject study , follow information collect 40 patient : ( ) Demographic data , include age , sex , ethnicity , duration illness medication regimen ( ii ) Anthropometry data , include height , weight , BMI , blood pressure , pulse rate . The following psychiatric rating scale use diagnostic measure . The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I . ) , well know psychiatric diagnostic interview protocol , administer baseline collect blood sample . The M.I.N.I . include item assess hallmark symptom exclusionary psychotic depression , psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder , eat disorder substance dependence . We use module help exclude patient prescribed diagnosis . Following MINI protocol , 40 ml venous blood , fast state , collect three separate vacutainer EDTA tube . One tube 10 ml send Clinical Pathology Laboratories measurement complete blood count , complete metabolic panel , fast lipid profile measurement triglyceride , high density lipoprotein , low density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein . The complete blood count complete metabolic panel do rule infection co-morbidity . Another 10 ml tube send Clinical Pathology lab measurement serum 25-hydroxy D level . The third tube 20 ml blood use isolate buffy coat measure protein mRNA expression vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , CYP24A1 CYP27B1 , separate serum measure leptin adiponectin level . This latter part do research laboratory PI use follow procedure .</detailed_description>
