	<brief_summary>This multi-centre , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group study evaluate efficacy safety mepolizumab adjunctive therapy participant severe eosinophilic asthma marker asthma control . The overall intent current study fully explore impact mepolizumab health-related quality life ( HR-QoL ) measure asthma control , include lung function . Participants meet predefined criterion randomise receive either mepolizumab placebo addition standard care asthma treatment . Approximately 780 participant severe eosinophilic asthma screen ensure randomisation 544 participant ( 272 participant per treatment group ) study .</brief_summary>
