	<brief_title>MMV390048 Against Early Plasmodium Falciparum Blood Stage Infection Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study use induced blood stage malaria infection characterize activity MMV390048 early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection . There two cohort 8 subject . In first cohort single dose 20 mg MMV390048 investigate . Depending data obtain , dose Cohort 2 may adjust exceed maximum tolerate dose ( high achieve dose base predefined exposure cap ) determine ongoing single ascend dose study . Each participant inoculate Day 0 ~1,800 viable parasite Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor daily positive presence malaria parasite . Once positive monitor twice-daily treatment , adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . On day designate commencement treatment , participant admit study unit monitor . The threshold commencement treatment quantification participant ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL . If quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL , accompany clinical symptom score &gt; 5 , clinical parasitological evidence malaria occur participant participant reach treatment threshold ( quantification ≥ 1,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Following treatment MMV390048 , participant follow inpatient least 72 hour ensure tolerance treatment clinical response , outpatient basis clinically well monitor safety clearance malaria parasite . Compulsory treatment Riamet® ( artemether-lumefantrine ) start day 16 ( ±3 day ) post study treatment unless require earlier . Early intervention occur either poor response fast response see follow MMV390048 treatment . This ensure participant safety avoid participant inconvenience useful data obtain . Pre-emptive treatment Riamet® commence whenever necessary . Participants treat single dose ( 45 mg ) primaquine ( Primacin™ ) end Riamet® treatment gametocyte identify , ensure complete clearance gametocyte present .</detailed_description>
