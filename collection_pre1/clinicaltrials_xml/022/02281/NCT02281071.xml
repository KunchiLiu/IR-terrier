	<brief_summary>The benefit microsurgical approach periodontal therapy describe . The main focus study determine use microsurgical LMCAF technique would improve outcome therapy Miller Class III isolate recession-type defect . Six month result study show LMCAF microsurgical approach offer good complete mean root coverage result macrosurgical LMCAF technique . The superior effect microsurgical approach post-operative morbidity make technique preferable patient expect comfortable postoperative period . This study support use microsurgical aproach LMCAF procedure significantly affect clinical patient-centered success treat Miller Class III isolate typed defect .</brief_summary>
