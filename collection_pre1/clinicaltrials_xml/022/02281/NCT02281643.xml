	<detailed_description>The purpose study describe immune response Mansonella perstans without doxycycline treatment . And suggest use doxycycline treatment Mansonella perstans infected individual . Two hundred Mansonella perstans infected individual contact patient Buruli ulcer Tuberculosis recruit place two group . Hundred patient group ( 'early ' , 'delayed ' doxycycline-treatment group ) weight 40kg . Individuals recruit community Asante Akim North District . Half M. perstans infected individual ( randomly select ) treat immediately 200mg daily doxycycline six week . All recruited individual ask donate 20ml ; 10 ml heparinized blood , 5ml Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood 5ml blood serum analysis baseline ( day 0 ) , 4 month ( day 112 ) , 12 month ( day 336 ) 24 month ( day 672 ) . Six month doxycycline treatment M. perstans infected individual 100 patient treated time point 0 ( delay ' treatment group ) treat describe 'early ' treatment group . After four month ( day 112 ) individual treatment group ask donate blood quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction confirm Wolbachia depletion immunological analysis . For 'early ' , 'delayed ' , doxycycline-treatment group immunological assay perform day 0 , 112 , 336 672 treatment initiation recruit individual . Hypothesis : Presence filarial nematode Mansonella perstans polarize host immunity towards humoral T helper type 2-mediated immunity treatment doxycycline result kill Wolbachia endosymbionts , depletion Mansonella perstans development T helper type 1 immunity reduce risk develop Tuberculosis Buruli ulcer Sample size justification Since study pilot study gain first experience regard primary secondary endpoint intend treatment regimen , sample size justified statistical argumentation . A sample size 100 participant ( 80 participant plus 20 % drop-out rate ) per treatment arm chosen agreement study statistician . Statistical method The detailed plan data analysis write discuss DMEC final de-blinding data . Data safety Electronic data secure password limited person name Study Protocol . Analyses data perform copy original data file ensure raw data accessibility time . Regular backup external hard drive carry ensure protection data loss . Data Monitoring Ethics Committee ( DMEC ) Independent monitor clinical trial carry DMEC consist representative key stakeholder exist filarial control program necessary expertise cover range project activity skills provide support advice study progress . Additionally External Scientific Advisory Committee ( ESAC ) monitor study ensure compliance directive . DMEC ESAC member list Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) Regulatory requirement necessitates obtain documenting informed consent , Good Clinical Practice ethical principle along Declaration Helsinki ( first adopt 1964 , amend five time , recently 2000 ) . All consent form accompany study protocol submit approval relevant ethic committee . Patient insurance Professional indemnity liability insurance individual volunteer obtain take care form injury may arise process drug administration .</detailed_description>
