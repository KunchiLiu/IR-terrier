	<brief_summary>Restoring patency coronary vessel provide ischemic myocardium reperfused blood cause additional tissue damage . A key element ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury major determinant evolution damage affect myocardium inflammatory response . The main objective study evaluate efficacy colchicine reduce I/R injury effectively modulate inflammatory response reperfused myocardium .</brief_summary>
