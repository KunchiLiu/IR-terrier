	<detailed_description>The goal clinical investigation reduce phantom limb pain ( PLP ) , painful condition affect 70 % amputee , improve patient ' quality life . Traditionally , mirror box therapy tool base concept , use alleviate pain , efficacy varies greatly . This project target amputees PLP treatment fail . Various virtual environment , include virtual/augmented reality , control patient 's phantom limb use muscle ( myoelectric ) signal stump . The patient learn reactivates area brain related motor control miss limb . The medical device non-invasive base surface electromyography , standard widely use clinical research tool . The surface electrodes standard disposable electrode widely use clinic hospital EMG and/or ECG . - Myoelectric amplifier ( battery operated isolated power grid ) - Data acquisition electronics - Personal computer - Standard webcam - Myoelectric pattern recognition ( MPR ) software - Virtual Reality ( VR ) - Augmented Reality ( AR ) - Computer game The clinical investigation period consist 12 session per patient include 3 short follow-up assessment . Length session : 1.5 hour ( first session take long time due learning/familiarization ) . The center participate study choose follow treatment administration : - 2 time per week ( advise ) - 1 time per week - Daily ( 5 time per week )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Amputee patient older 18 year . The patient sign write informed consent . Patients must treat least one follow therapy : 1 . Conventional mirror training 2 . Transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TENS ) 3 . Acupuncture 4 . Selfhypnosis 5 . Drugbased The last session previous therapy ( 1 2 ) must least 1 month begin treatment propose . In case drugbased treatment ( 5 ) , patient must report PLP reduction least 1 month drugbased treatment variation medicament dose . Any pain reduction potentially attribute drugbased treatment must least 3 month old . At least portion biceps triceps muscle must present . Patient must significant cognitive impairment prevents follow instruction . Upper limb amputee exclude shoulder disarticulation . Obese patient automatically exclude , however , evaluation system require analyse sufficient electromyography signal record . Stump pain 2 VAS pain . Participating clinical study could interfere result ongoing study . Condition associate risk poor protocol compliance . Any condition symptom prevent patient enter study , accord investigatorÂ´s judgement .</criteria>
