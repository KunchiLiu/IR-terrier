	<criteria>Males female least 18 year age . Female subject postmenopausal , surgically sterilize use reliable nonhormonal method contraception . Examples reliable nonhormonal method contraception include tubal ligation , hysterectomy , intrauterine device , barrier method combine spermicide . Hormonal contraceptive allow effect BIA 2093 metabolism oral contraceptive yet know . Subjects suffer chronic illness , hepatic impairment , stable condition , regard investigator able influence outcome study . For subject include Group 1 , stage moderate hepatic impairment , extent , measure ChildPugh classification , result recruitment study ( Group 1 ) . This apply subject recruit Group 2 , whose liver functioning normal . Body mass le 50 kg . The receipt investigational drug within 30 day prior trial . Clinically significant abnormal finding ( judged investigator ) follow parameter , except consistent finding hepatic impairment : haematology , biochemistry , clot profile , urinalysis , vital sign ECG screen test . A history laboratory evidence renal impairment and/or disease . Owing metabolic pathway BIA 2093 , degree renal impairment would confound effect PK analysis . Positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) 1 HIV2 antibody , Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody . HIV positive patient , patient Hepatitis B C , generally average , case markedly decrease , level health owe nature respective infection natural course disease , often complicate array opportunistic illness . Their ill health would worsen fact patient hepatically impaired , , often debilitate , complication . If patient HIV Hepatitis B C include study , could lead statistical confusion assess safety tolerability parameter . This event report subject , might part spectrum complaint HIV positive patient Hepatitis B C patient , would confound safety tolerability analysis . In addition , administer study medication patient , AEs might occur would add discomfort patient . A history illness , opinion investigator and/or sponsor , might confound result study pose additional risk administer investigational product subject . Any plan procedure and/or device performed/added course study , might influence evaluation endpoint study . Current addiction alcohol determine investigator . Use medication , prescribed overthecounter , except drug indicate treatment concomitant illnesses subject moderate hepatic impairment , drug would affect outcome study opinion investigator . Vitamin use allow , stable course study . Current treatment oxcarbazepine . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation . Subjects supine pulse rate screening , rest 5 min , outside range 50 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) . A history multiple and/or severe allergy drug food history anaphylactic reaction . Known suspect allergy trial product relate product ( e.g carbamazepine oxcarbazepine ) . Female subject pregnant lactating . Previous participation ( recruitment ) trial . Donation loss blood equal exceed 500 mL 8 week dose administration . Any history bleeding tendency , active bleed precede 3 month .</criteria>
