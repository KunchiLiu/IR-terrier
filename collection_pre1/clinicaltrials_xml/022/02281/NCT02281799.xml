	<brief_summary>Azathioprine ( AZA ) metabolite 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) develop 50 year ago Gertrude Elion George Hitchings initially use clinically management childhood leukemia organ transplantation . The first case report 6-MP use inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) 1962 , since use thiopurines well establish management moderate severe IBD . Thiopurines offer inexpensive effective treatment option maintenance remission IBD comparison biological agent may 30 time expensive . Although 50-60 % IBD patient respond thiopurines , significant proportion patient tolerate due various adverse effect . The adverse effect thiopurines may dose related , patient relate idiosyncratic . The immunosuppressive effect thiopurines also increase rate opportunistic infection . Thiopurines also associate high rate malignancy , particularly malignant Burkitt-like lymphoma , relate Epstein-Barr virus infection . Other adverse effect thiopurine relate allergic phenomenon . An idiosyncratic adverse effect thiopurine use acute pancreatitis ( AP ) . Acute inflammation pancreas define INSPPIRE criterion : require 2 : 1 . Abdominal pain compatible AP 2 . Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 time upper limit normal 3 . Imaging finding AP Drug induce AP assume diagnosis cause AP find , patient take drug know associated AP , symptom resolve drug discontinuation . If pancreatitis re-occurs re-exposure , drug definitely consider cause . While drug consider rare cause AP case mild self limited , 8 fold high risk AP IBD patient treat AZA . Thiopurine induce AP usually detect within 4 week start treatment . However case thiopurine induce AP , clear understanding mechanism . Thiopurine induce AP generally consider indication cease thiopurine therapy , due assume risk recurrence AP reintroduction . There exist several case report anecdotal evidence reintroduce thiopurines follow assumed thiopurine associate AP well tolerate . The investigator hypothesize AZA and/or 6-MP safely reintroduce management IBD patient follow thiopurine-induced pancreatitis . If past patient treat AZA , commence 6-MP , past treat 6-MP , commenced AZA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research protocol extend 3.5 month , participant attend 5 clinic visit Shaare Zedek Medical Centre : screening visit , week 0 , week 4 , week 8 week 12 . During screen visit , patient identify meet exclusion inclusion criterion agree participate study , medical record review previous clinical biochemical evidence pancreatitis , relate , unrelated thiopurine use . Patients undergo physical examination , baseline blood test include measurement lipase and/or amylase , liver biochemistry fast lipid profile . If already test , patient TPMT activity test . Participants also baseline abdominal ultrasound confirm normal anatomy absence cholelithiasis At week 0 , clinical , biochemicals ultrasound suggestion pancreatitis , participant commence alternative thiopurine use past . That , past treated AZA , commence 6-MP , past treat 6MP , commence AZA . The medication commence standard dose ( ie AZA 2.5mg/kg/day , 6MP 1.5mg/kg/day ) . Depending specific situation , assume relevant information available , screen visit may merge week 0 visit . In week 1 , 2 , 3 6 blood test ( full blood count liver biochemistry ) perform local clinic , investigator telephone contact participant discus result discuss adverse effect medication . In week 4 , 8 12 participant attend clinic investigator medical history , clinical examination review blood test ( blood count liver enzymes ) . In event new onset upper abdominal pain emesis , patient instruct present nearest medical facility blood test ( include serum amylase and/or lipase ) ultrasound , clinically indicate , contact investigator consider cessation thiopurine . At end 3 month period , patient show sign pancreatitis , revert regular monitoring thiopurine therapy per treat gastroenterologist .</detailed_description>
