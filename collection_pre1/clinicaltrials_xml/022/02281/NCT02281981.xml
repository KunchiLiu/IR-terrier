	<brief_summary>Arterial Stiffness : As recognize independent indicator cardiovascular risk , maintain low level arterial stiffen important cardiovascular health . Increases arterial stiffen result elevate systolic mean pressure correlate various cardiovascular condition leave ventricular hypertrophy , ischaemic heart disease , myocardial infarction . In contrast , decrease arterial stiffness improve ventricular-vascular coupling , ejection fraction , cardiac output . Arterial stiffness link inflammation oxidative stress . Both inflammation oxidative stress elevate DOMS ( delay onset muscle soreness ) , state bring muscle damage often incur strenuous exercise . Recent study show single bout eccentric exercise produce acute arterial stiffness recovery . However , anti-oxidants/anti-inflammatories may effective reduce extent damage decrease oxidation inflammation . Curcumin powerful antioxidant could act anti-inflammatory diminish effect downhill run . In addition , eccentric damage generates prophylactic protection last six week . The nature downhill run primarily eccentric nature . Therefore , repeat bout may diminish DOMS development . Any reduction stress either prophylactic repeat bout effect Curcumin supplement , attenuate increase arterial stiffness due reduction inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline Participants report lab day one basic anthropometry clinical measure perform . Following measure height , weight , blood pressure , blood lipid ( fast glucose ) , creatine kinase , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( HS-CRP ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) participant allow eat small standardized snack . Participants measure baseline muscle soreness leg strength measure prior VO2max test cycle ergometer . Muscle Soreness measure use standard 10cm analogue scale girth thigh record account possible alteration owe local inflammation/oedema./ Creatine Kinase ( CK ) track measure damage . The test termination criterion VO2max include : volitional fatigue , participant rating perceive exertion 19-20 ( scale 0-20 ) , plateau O2 uptake increase workload , RER &gt; 1.15 . The VT participant note compare value post- training . Testing Day 2 - This day occur least 1 full day ( 48h ) follow VO2max test . Participants arrive lab consume standardized breakfast . Prior downhill run , measure pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , heart rate variability ( HRV ) , flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) collect accord protocol follow . Participants perform 40 minute downhill run grade -12 percent use speed elicits VO2 approximately 60 % maximum value achieve max test . Arterial stiffness determine use Sphygmocor CPVH pulse wave applanation tonomoter ( Atcor Medical ) . This device measure arterial pulse wave non-invasively skin . By match pulse wave arrival heart beat ( standard ECG tracing ) measure distance point calculate travel time ( velocity ) . We also use device analyze shape pulse wave , give u information reflect pulse wave ( thus stiffness arterial tree ) . Follow-up : At 24h , 48h , 72h post exercise , participant return lab non-exercise measure repeat ( see figure 1 ) . This allow temporal tracking time . Hypotheses : 1 ) The anti-inflammatory potential Curcumin supplementation improve post-exercise recovery . 2 ) Repeated bout eccentrically bias downhill run produce prophylactic effect reduce arterial stiffness recovery time</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects male female 18yr 45yr Free know suspected chronic condition . General health suitability participate exercise/health research study confirm use PARQ+ screen questionnaire Any participant positive answer screen question require seek physician approval prior physical exercise . Baseline arrhythmia ( tachycardia ( &gt; 100pbm ) systolic diastolic hypertension ( &gt; 140/90 mmHg ) also reason exclusion . During baseline anthropometric assessment confirm participant fall within typical BMI range ( 2030 kg/m2 ) either `` normal '' weight `` overweight '' , `` underweight '' `` obese '' . Persons take cardiovascular medication , metabolic medication , smoke cigarette , excessively consume alcohol , prone heartburn , previous diagnosis hyperlipidemia hyperinsulemia also exclude</criteria>
