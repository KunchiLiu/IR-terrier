	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate possible decrease opioid consumption patient undergo ankle fracture surgery provide schedule dos nonsteroidal inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . This prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control study two group patient : one get NSAIDs take regularly schedule time plus traditional prescription opioid medication one receive traditional prescription opioid medication placebo . Patients assign group computer-generated program . Neither patient doctor nurse know group , pharmacist information . Patients group opportunity take opioid medication pain becomes unmanageable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NSAIDs Pain After Ankle Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Opioid abuse rampant , bad consequence , source many individual societal problem . Although use fulfills role pain control , investigation seek find pain control alternative potential few adverse consequence patient undergoing surgery ankle fracture . Hypothesis : A structured regimen NSAIDs ( drug ibuprofen naproxen ) ankle fracture surgery provide adequate pain relief cause patient take few dos opioid drug . Methods : This prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control study patient ankle fracture require surgical treatment several NSLIJ orthopaedic surgeon North Shore University Hospital Long Island Jewish Medical Center . There two group patient : one get NSAIDs take regularly schedule time plus traditional prescription opioid medication one receive traditional prescription opioid medication placebo . Patients assign group computer-generated program . Neither patient doctor nurse know group , pharmacist information . Patients group opportunity take opioid medication pain becomes unmanageable . We evaluate whether patient NSAIDs group ) pain patient prescribe opioid pain killer surgery b ) amount opioid pain killer reduce patient take schedule dos NSAIDs . We also describe well poorly patient heal , look several timepoints surgery , use Xrays evaluate formation new bone . The test ( experimental ) group give dose IV ( intravenous ) ketorolac , NSAID , surgery , give naproxen 500mg orally two time per day take regular basis surgery four week . This group give percocet 5/325 ( opioid medication ) 1-2 pill orally every 4 hour take pain medication naproxen provide adequate pain relief . The control group administer saline dose surgery equivalent IV ketorolac . These patient take placebo pain pill regular basis two time per day four week , take percocet pain relief . This equivalent common pain protocol give patient ankle fracture surgery , give percocet take as-needed basis . The placebo naproxen medication unidentifiable capsule form unmarked bottle . The maximum daily dose percocet 8 pill , exceed 2.6g acetaminophen daily . Both group take aspirin ( ASA ) 325mg orally daily two week prevent blood clot . All patient take pantoprazole 40mg orally daily . Pantoprazole proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) suppress production stomach acid , prevent development gastrointestinal ulcer . We collect demographic data patient . We also collect data surgery : surgery time , treat surgeon , type surgery , location complexity fracture . W study follow outcome : pain relief , opioid use bone healing . To measure outcome , use pain scale call VAS look difference group . A change 10 millimeter scale 100 millimeter consider important pain difference . We also ask patient fill journal medication use , perform pill count , examine Xrays ask patient respond FFI , questionnaire evaluate well function . Patients see followup 2 week , 6 week , 2 month , 6 month , 1 year surgery , last visit usual standard visit schedule ankle fracture surgery . At visit , Xrays take ankle evaluate ankle position , determine whether bone healing occur . Patients incur extra expense result participate study . Since patient know group assign -- test ( experimental ) control -- investigator carefully explain determine need take prescribed opioid pain medication patient subject unnecessary pain . Since group access opioid pain medication , study design determine patient NSAIDs group already get relief pain experience pain low level , able determine study complete blind broken .</detailed_description>
