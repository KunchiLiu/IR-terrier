	<brief_summary>Researchers develop nomogram evaluate risk recurrence surgical resection , find stage 1 NSCLC patient 104 point nomogram show similar recurrence rate recurrence rate stage 2 NSCLC patient . Thus stage 1 NSCLC patient high recurrence rate consider show positive effect adjuvant chemotherapy perform study prove hypothesis . Applying nomogram , patient score low 104 categorize low risk group group observation group adjuvant chemotherapy give . The high risk group patient ( nomogram score large 104 ) randomly divide treatment group observation group . Then , clinical result recurrence observation group treatment group compare . - Regimen adjuvant chemotherapy : The commonly used 1st line chemotherapy regimen vinorelbine plus cisplatin admit 4 cycle . Also three day estimate day permit allowance . Intravenous administration vinorelbine ( 25mg/m2 ) , 1st 8th day cycle , every 3 week . Intravenous administration cisplatin ( 75mg/m2 ) , 1st day cycle , every 3 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolled stage 1B adenocarcinoma patient register study randomly allocate treatment group observation group stratification factor ; institution . Each group determine number study population . This study open label follow permuted block design . Also patient allocate randomized table provide statistician . If convert e-CRF , randomization patient perform automated computer program . Total 1012 patient enrol study . Among 506 high risk stage 1B adenocarcinoma patient , patient allocate treatment observation group , 253 patient . Also 506 low risk stage 1B adenocarcinoma patient enrolled observation group . Because , among stage 1B patient , reveal high risk patient whose nomogram point exceed 104 occupied 50 % analysis . Estimated 3 year disease free survival treatment group observation group 66 % 54 % , respectively . The 3 year disease free survival rate observation group estimate base retrospective multicenter study 1132 stage 1 NSCLC patient , previously report Korea . During 3 year follow duration , withdrawal rate presume 10 % loss follow-up , violation consent cause . Study population enrollment estimate 48 month mean follow-up duration estimate 24 month . Total duration study set 72 month . In study design , number high risk patient group 253 support 80 % power test two-sided alpha level 0.05 .</detailed_description>
