	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation（HSCT）is curative treatment variety malignant refractory benign hematologic disease , associate life-threatening complication time , among , hemostatic disorder uncommon present increase morbidity mortality HSCT recipient . Bleeding thrombosis , two controversial disorder , pose great threat patient set transplantation , early hemorrhagic complication HCST frequent subject concern clinical physician , previous study show risk bleed HSCT recipient 10-fold high neoplastic patient receive chemotherapy . Meanwhile , thrombosis event , characterize hepatic veno-occlusive disease ( HVOD ) , transplantation relate thrombotic microangiopathy ( TA-TMA ) , venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) imprudently ignore fatal threat patient . Over last two decade , recognize relatively increase incidence bleeding thrombotic complication correlate prognosis quality life HSCT recipient . Previous study show conventional risk factor include graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , infection , thrombocytopenia , anticoagulation therapy , damage endothelial cell condition regimen contribute onset hemostatic disorder HSCT recipient even exacerbate process . Nevertheless , roles detailed pathogenesis development bleed thrombosis remain undefined limited data Asian population know compete risk thrombosis bleeding . Given current understanding hemostatic complication many unknown mechanism relation thrombosis hemostasis，we undertook prospective study determine incidence , predictor factor , specific pathogenesis , survival specially patient thrombotic bleed complication well improve outcome .</detailed_description>
