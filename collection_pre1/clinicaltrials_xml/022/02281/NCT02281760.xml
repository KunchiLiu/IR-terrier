	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient previously simultaneously enrolled natural history ECD protocol # 11HG0207 , Clinical Basic Investigations Erdheim Chester disease . Eligible patient must diagnose Erdheim Chester disease , confirm pathological evaluation affect tissue adequate staining . Affected tissue must harbor BRAF V600E V600K mutation . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Patients must BRAFV600E BRAFV600K mutation , identify FDAapproved test CLIAcertified lab . If test CLIAcertified lab use nonFDA approved method , information assay must provide . ( FDA approve test BRAF V600 mutation melanoma include : THxID BRAF Detection Kit Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test ) . Prior treatment , involve interferon , anakinra , imatinib , steroid , chemotherapy , limited cladribine , vinblastine , 6mercaptopurine etoposide , medication use empirically treatment ECD , acceptable . These therapy complete discontinued 4 week prior enrollment study . Age great equal to18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use dabrafenib combination trametinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 ( Karnofsky great equal 70 % ) . Exception make patient ECOG performance status less equal 3 Karnosfky performance scale great equal 50 % , require use wheelchair , walker can well assistance daily routine secondary disability cause ECD cerebellar brain disease stable great equal 3 month . Life expectancy great 3 month . Able swallow retain oral medication must clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal to1.2x10 ( 9 ) /L Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Platelets great equal to100x10 ( 9 ) /L Albumin great equal to2.5 g/dL Serum bilirubin less equal to1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) except subject know Gilbert syndrome Aspartate aminostransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal to2.5x institutional ULN Serum creatinine less equal to1.5 mg/dL OR calculate creatinine clearance ( CockroftGault formula ) great equal 50 mL/min Prothrombin time ( PT ) /International normalize ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) less equal to1.3x institutional ULN ; subject receive anticoagulation treatment may allow participate INR establish within therapeutic range prior randomization . Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal institutional low limit normal ( LLN ) ECHO Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration randomization . Pregnancy breast feeding . The effect dabrafenib trametinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control , abstinence ; hormonal contraception allow due drugdrug interaction render hormonal contraceptive ineffective ) duration study participation , least 2 week treatment dabrafenib 4 month dabrafenib combination trametinib . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Based study animal , also know dabrafenib may cause damage tissue make sperm . This may cause sperm abnormal shape size could lead infertility , may irreversible . Safety efficacy combination dabrafenib trametinib pediatric population investigate . Dabrafenib trametinibdabrafenib combination administer pediatric population outside clinical trial . Therapeutic level dose warfarin use close monitoring PT/INR site . Exposure may decrease due enzyme induction treatment , thus warfarin dose may need adjust base upon PT/INR . Consequently , discontinue dabrafenib , warfarin exposure may increase thus close monitoring via PT/INR warfarin dose adjustment must make clinically appropriate . Prophylactic low dose warfarin may give maintain central catheter patency . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inability provide inform consent .

Patients history RAS mutationpositive tumor eligible regardless interval current study . Note : RAS test absence RAS mutation require eligibility . Leptomeningeal brain metastasis metastases cause spinal cord compression symptomatic untreated stable great equal 3 month ( must document imaging ) require corticosteroid . Subjects stable dose corticosteroid &gt; 1 month corticosteroid least 2 week enrol approval CTEP medical monitor . Subjects must also enzymeinducing anticonvulsant &gt; 4 week . History evidence cardiovascular risk , except stable ECD cardiac lesion , include follow : QT interval correct heart rate use Bazett formula QTcB great equal 480 msec . History acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting within past 24 week prior randomization . History evidence current Class II , III , IV heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system . Intracardiac defibrillator . Abnormal cardiac valve morphology ( great equal grade 2 ) document ECHO ; ( subject grade 1 abnormality [ i.e. , mild regurgitation/stenosis ] enter study ) . Subjects moderate valvular thickening enter study . History evidence current clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ; clarification : Subjects atrial fibrillation control &gt; 30 day prior dose eligible . Treatment refractory hypertension define blood pressure systolic &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg control antihypertensive therapy Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate study treatment , excipients , and/or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . Any serious unstable preexist medical condition ( aside malignancy exception specify ) , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject safety , obtain informed consent , compliance study procedure . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother dabrafenib/trametinib , breastfeed discontinue prior treatment dabrafenib/trametinib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . History retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) . Interstitial lung disease pneumonitis secondary ECD . Central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) include presence predisposing factor RVO CSR ( e.g. , uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , history hyperviscosity hypercoagulability syndrome ) ; visible pathology ( e.g. , evidence optic disc cupping , evidence new visual field defect automate perimetry , intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg measure tonography ) assess ophthalmic examination . Inability travel NIH Clinical Center . Patients wild type BRAF gene molecular result ECD affect tissue . Patients confirm diagnosis ECD asymptomatic visceral involvement eligible trial ( Patients target lesion per RECIST 1.1 criterion .</criteria>
