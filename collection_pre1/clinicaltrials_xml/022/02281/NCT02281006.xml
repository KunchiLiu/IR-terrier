	<brief_title>Efficacy Trans-tympanic Injections Sodium Thiosulfate Gel Prevent Cisplatin-induced Ototoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cisplatin ( cis-DiammineDichloridoPlatinum , DDP ) antineoplastic agent use treatment solid malignant tumor adult also key part treatment many child adolescent cancer . However , treatment Cisplatin carry risk serious dose-limiting adverse effect . Ototoxicity major concern since associate hearing loss greatly impairs patient ' quality life preventive treatment presently available . Cisplatin ototoxicity important problem patient treat head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) receive repeatedly high dos . Cisplatin cause accumulation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) cochlea , trigger damage outer hair cell organ Corti . Sulfur-containing antioxidant neutralize ROS follow Cisplatin intoxication , thus represent potential preventive measure . A sulfur-containing molecule study . Experimental human study show sodium thiosulfate ( STS ) protect Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity . However , administer blood stream , STS interfere Cisplatin treatment efficacy . To counter ototoxic effect Cisplatin treatment without impair efficacy , local pharmacology approach directly aim cochlea , would represent powerful clinical strategy . The propose study first test efficacy STS administer locally middle ear prevent Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity human . Objective The objective study test efficacy trans-tympanic injection sodium thiosulfate-hyaluronate gel prior cisplatin treatment prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity patient locally advanced head neck cancer . The principal objective test efficacy trans-tympanic injection gel pure tone high frequency . Exploratory analysis secondary objective assess 1 ) cochlear damage , specifically hair cell function 2 ) hearing loss frequency use speech perception . Other outcomes consider severity ototoxicity adverse effect trans-tympanic injection . Methods The propose study randomize control trial . For participant , one randomly select ear receive treatment ear . For ethical reason , control ear receive placebo injection . Participants trial recruit radiation therapy department CHU de Québec . Eligible participant patient newly diagnose locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck schedule treat concomitant chemoradiation . This treatment include Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 , 22 , 43 first radiation fraction . At end first day radiation therapy , pharmacy department CHU de Québec prepare sodium thiosulfate hyaluronate gel mix 0.55 ml 25 % solution sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate ( Seacalphyx , Drug identification number ( DIN ) 02386666 , Seaford Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 0.55 ml hyaluronate gel ( Healon 10 mg , Abbott Medical Optics Inc. ) . After local anesthesia tympanic membrane , otologist deposit 0.1 ml gel exactly round window middle ear . From STS diffuse towards cochlea . The procedure repeat eve subsequent Cisplatin treatment day 22 43 . To assess effect trial intervention , complete audiologic evaluation conduct one month end chemoradiation therapy . The CHU de Québec audiologists perform audiograms frequency range 0.5 14 kHz . Sound intensity measure dBHL ( decibel hear level ) . Speech reception threshold also assess . In addition , distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) recording also perform . Otoacoustic emission measurement could detect hair cell damage due Cisplatin early . The final audiologic evaluation conduct audiologist blind ear assignment would access trial hospital record . Adverse effect transtympanic injection document accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAE ) . In addition , identify unexpected adverse effect trial intervention hearing , shorter unblinded audiogram conduct proceed second third transtympanic injection . Data audiogram use main analysis.The follow-up audiologic safety monitor continue one year end trial . The principal outcome hearing loss define difference average permanent threshold shift ( PTS ) dB ( decibel ) four pure tone high frequency ( 9 , 10 , 12.5 14 kHz ) use data audiogram do Cisplatin therapy , patient ear . The average PTS dB pure tone high frequency compare treat control ear use t-test pair data . A planned interim analysis conduct half anticipated participant would complete follow-up . In interim analysis , test superiority do two-sided alpha=0.01 result show Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) . If DSMC recommendation continue trial plan , final analysis do two-sided alpha=0.045 order keep trial overall statistical significance level 0.05 . Exploratory analyse secondary outcome assess 1 ) cochlear damage , specifically hair cell function obtain result DPOAEs , ands 2 ) difference PTS dB pure tone average ( 0.5 8 kHz ) , represent frequency speech perception . Other outcomes consider ototoxicity severity accord CTCAE , adverse effect transtympanic injection . The investigator establish independent DSMC overview conduct trial comprise expert biostatistics , audiology , haemato-oncology .</detailed_description>
