	<detailed_description>Rationale Neonatal sepsis important determinant adverse neurodevelopmental outcome [ Adams-Chapman 2006 , Stoll 2004 ] . A recent meta-analysis estimate neonatal sepsis double risk adverse neurodevelopmental outcome very-low-birth-weight ( VLBW ) infant ( OR 2.09 [ 95 % CI 1.65-2.65 ] ) , include cerebral palsy ( OR 2.09 [ 95 % CI 1.78-2.45 ] ) . [ Alshaikh 2013 ] When baby sign suggestive sepsis , common practice commence intravenous antibiotic treatment soon possible culture blood relevant additional site obtain . However , culture remain negative important subgroup baby treat sepsis , despite convince clinical and/or laboratory sign sepsis present . Although evidence suggest long-term outcome follow neonatal sepsis may differ accord whether diagnosis confirm culture , [ Stoll 2004 , Schlapbach 2011 ] best investigator ' knowledge direct comparison group never make . Greater understanding impact culture-positivity long-term outcome set clinical neonatal sepsis essential well inform parent future prospect child guide patient follow-up . Objective Investigate difference neurodevelopmental outcome two year neonatal sepsis accord whether diagnosis confirm culture . Research question Primary Are neurodevelopmental outcomes two year different baby suspect versus culture-proven sepsis ? Secondary Are neurodevelopmental outcomes two year different baby suspect versus culture-proven sepsis consider accord underlie pathogen ? Design Secondary cohort analysis baby include International Neonatal Immunotherapy Study ( INIS ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) . [ INIS Study Collaborative Group 2008 ] Study population The study population consist baby include INIS trial . The INIS trial RCT intravenous immunoglobulin ( two infusion 500 mg/kg body weight polyvalent IgG ) versus placebo treatment suspect proven neonatal sepsis . [ INIS Study Collaborative Group 2008 ] 3493 infant include 113 hospital nine country . [ INIS Collaborative Group 2011 ] There difference treatment group primary outcome death major disability age two year ( RR 1.00 [ 95 % CI 0.92-1.08 ] ) , secondary outcome . Neither effect immunoglobulin demonstrate pre-specified subgroup analysis . As intervention study impact outcome , secondary observational analysis within dataset feasible . Exposure For primary analysis two group baby neonatal sepsis consider : proven sepsis suspect sepsis . Sepsis consider proven pathogenic organism ( i.e . bacteria fungi ) culture blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid . All baby clinical neonatal sepsis culture remain negative consider suspected sepsis . In secondary analysis , neurodevelopmental outcome baby prove sepsis compare suspected sepsis accord causative organism group follow : coagulase-negative staphylococci ( CONS ) ; Gram-positive bacteria ; Gram-negative bacteria ; fungi . Babies classify accord sepsis episode time inclusion INIS trail . The impact additional episode sepsis investigate sensitivity analysis ( see ) . Outcomes The primary outcome interest death major disability two year age . Secondary outcome ( two year age ) include : death ; disability ; component disability : neuromotor disability ; disability due seizure ; hear disability ; visual disability ; communicative disability ; cognitive disability . All type disability categorise major/non-major/no disability . The investigator use two questionnaire ; Health Status Questionnaire ( HSQ ) complete pediatrician Parent Questionnaire ( PQ ) complete parent carer . A third questionnaire , Short Health Status Questionnaire ( SHSQ ) , develop Project Management Group order capture primary outcome difficult find child . These questionnaire send general practitioner health visitor . The disability classification domain ( exception cognitive domain ) calculate answer question HSQ PQ [ see INIS Collaborative Group 2011 ( online supplement ) detail ] . If one questionnaire missing , calculation use answer questionnaire . If domain classification unknown SHSQ receive , classification questionnaire use domain . Cognitive function assess INIS parent use revised Parent Report Children 's Abilities questionnaire ( PARCA-R1 [ Saudino 1998 ] ) , describe previously [ INIS Collaborative Group 2011 ( online supplement ) ] . Analyses The following characteristic compare baby proven suspect sepsis tabular form : baseline characteristic , clinical characteristic presentation sepsis , neonatal outcome discharge ; outcome two year . Primary secondary outcome two year compare two group univariable analysis use Chi square test . Multivariable adjustment potential confounders around birth presentation sepsis ( include country INIS study drug ) perform use separate logistic regression model outcome . The logistic regression model consider primary analysis . Separate model construct major disability disability ( major+non-major ) . Subgroup analyse Two set subgroup analyse undertaken . First , give difference aetiology early onset ( &lt; 72 hour birth ) sepsis late onset ( &gt; =72 hour birth ) sepsis , data re-analysed accord whether sepsis episode early late onset . Second , gestational age key determinant adverse neurodevelopmental outcome , investigator undertake subgroup analysis investigate impact proven versus suspect sepsis neurodevelopmental outcomes accord whether gestational age birth &lt; ≥ 30 week . Sensitivity analyse Missing value present number covariates include multivariable adjustment . By default , logistic regression analysis base baby complete data variable model . The investigator thus undertake sensitivity analysis multiple imputation miss data covariates include primary model , create analyse five unique datasets . For primary analysis study , neonatal sepsis episode presentation ( i.e . inclusion INIS trial ) consider classify baby suspect proven sepsis . An important subgroup baby however , experience one additional episode sepsis follow inclusion study , may affect finding depend whether culture-proven . The investigator therefore undertake two additional sensitivity analyse assess impact subsequent episodes sepsis difference neurodevelopmental outcome accord whether proven sepsis present . In first sensitivity analysis investigator exclude cohort baby additional episode neonatal sepsis present follow initial presentation sepsis . This facilitate fair comparison baby single episode proven versus suspected sepsis . In second sensitivity analysis full cohort , investigator re-classify proven sepsis baby label suspect sepsis base initial presentation , subsequent episode proven sepsis present . The investigator compare neurodevelopmental outcome accord whether proven sepsis present time point initial hospital admission . Sample size The sample size cohort base original RCT design . [ INIS Study Collaborative Group 2008 , INIS Collaborative Group 2011 ] For purpose secondary analysis cohort may thus consider convenience sample . To best investigator ' knowledge cohort second large evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome follow neonatal sepsis . [ Alshaikh 2013 ] In multivariate analysis 6093 extremely-low-birth-weight ( ELBW ) infants National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) cohort follow two year age , Stoll colleague able demonstrate clinically relevant difference ( OR ≥1.3 ) key neurodevelopmental outcome uninfected baby different category baby neonatal sepsis statistical significance . [ Stoll 2004 ] The accounted subgroup analyse accord causative organism . [ Stoll 2004 ] In much small study , others also demonstrate statistically significant impact neonatal sepsis neurodevelopmental outcome , review elsewhere . [ Alshaikh 2013 ] The investigator therefore expect INIS cohort sufficient power detect clinically relevant difference ( OR ≥1.3 ) neurodevelopmental outcome VLBW infant suspect versus proven neonatal sepsis . Ethical consideration The original RCT approve national local ethical committee participate hospital . Anonymised data use purpose secondary analysis . According UK Dutch regulation , formal ethical assessment require secondary analysis anonymised data . Dissemination Findings report manuscript submit publication lead medical journal appropriate field ( i.e . paediatrics , infection/immunology , neurology ) , may present international clinical research meeting .</detailed_description>
