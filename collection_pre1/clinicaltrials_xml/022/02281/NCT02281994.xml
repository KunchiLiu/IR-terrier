	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study PEMF treatment improve odontoid fracture healing , compare standard conservative care , subject 50 year age diagnose Type II odontoid fracture , effect evident 6 month post-injury . Subjects assess presence Type II odontoid fracture X-ray , MRI CT scan . Subjects meet eligibility criterion randomize 2:1 ratio ( active : placebo control ) either active control device 4 hour day 6 month . X-rays collect 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month assess fracture heal process , flexion-extension x-ray collect 3 , 6 12 month . A CT scan perform 6 month confirm heal . Quality Life measure ( SF-36 , VAS neck pain scale , NDI ) collect visit ( 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month ) . Study subject receive either active Orthofix Cervical-Stim Model 2205OD inactive ( placebo ) Orthofix Cervical-Stim Model 2205OD device .</brief_summary>
