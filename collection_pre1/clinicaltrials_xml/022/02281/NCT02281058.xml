	<brief_summary>Vitiligo chronic autoimmune disease evidence CTLA-4 involvement . We perform pilot study treatment new onset actively progress vitiligo abatacept determine weekly self-injections medication lead clinical improvement vitiligo lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Pilot Study Abatacept Treatment Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abatacept show decrease T cell activity reduce symptom associate rheumatoid arthritis . Similar pathway show involved vitiligo . Therefore , recruit 10 adult patient active vitiligo meet specific inclusion exclusion criterion receive self-administered injection abatacept weekly start week 0 continue week 24 . A 32 week follow-up visit perform evaluate secondary endpoint well . We monitor patient see skin lesion vitiligo stop spread start repigment continue treatment .</detailed_description>
