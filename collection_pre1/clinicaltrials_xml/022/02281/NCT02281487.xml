	<brief_title>Hysterectomy Benign Gynaecological Conditions With Without Tubectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Recent study woman hereditary high risk develop ovarian cancer indicate high grade serous carcinoma arise ( ectopic and/or dysplastic ) tubal epithelium . Historically , pre-menopausal woman undergo hysterectomy benign indication ( bleed disorder , fibroid adenomyosis ) adnexa , include Fallopian tube , leave situ . However , remove tube hysterectomy potentially prevents development serous ovarian carcinoma . Such simple preventive procedure avoid serious adverse effect adnexectomy , like premature ovarian failure ( POF ) . STUDY DESIGN This randomize controlled trial patient undergo hysterectomy benign indication either include group standard hysterectomy ( abdominal laparoscopic ) perform group hysterectomy ( abdominal laparoscopic ) combine salpingectomy.The accrual aim take July 2015 perform regular clinical setting . STUDY POPULATION Women undergo hysterectomy benign condition ( fibroid , endosalpingiosis , bleed disorder , etc ) either abdominal laparoscopic . SAMPLE SIZE N=50/arm TREATMENT Hysterectomy ( abdominal laparoscopic ) without bilateral tubectomy . METHODS 1 . Study endpoint Main study endpoint : serum concentration Anti Mullerian Hormone ( AMH ) operation average six month operation . Secondary study endpoint : premalignant change within remove Fallopian tube cohort woman , define histological dysplastic area detect light microscope 2 . Randomization Randomization perform online Alea software . 3 . Study procedures One day preoperative , together regular blood drawing , blood AMH concentration assessment drawn . The operation procedure either regular procedure regular procedure plus removal Fallopian tube remove tubes ovary dissection mesovarium . On expect average six month operation blood serum AMH concentration assessment drawn . Blood serum store -80C AMH concentration assessment perform one badge . 4 . Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . After withdrawal individual subject replace . 5 . Premature termination study In case serious adverse event ( like postoperative haemorrhage ) . SAFETY REPORTING 1 . In accordance section 10 , subsection 1 , WMO , investigator inform subject review accredit Medical Ethical Committee ( METC ) anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit METC , except insofar suspension would jeopardize subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep inform . 2 . Adverse serious adverse event All Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) report accredited METC approve protocol . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data describe qualitatively quantitatively . Student t-test apply study difference hormone level group . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 1 . The study conduct accord principle Declaration Helsinki ( 2nd edition , 2009 ) accordance Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( WMO ) . 2 . Patients recruit outpatient clinic decision make hysterectomy ( abdominal laparoscopic ) benign indication . They receive oral information gynecologist information letter hand ( telephone number state patient call extra information ) . On day preoperative admission ( mostly one day preoperative ) gynecologist answer remain question inform consent sign patient gynecologist . Patients oral contraceptive stop use least two week prior operation . 3 . Literature effect salpingectomy hysterectomy benign gynecological condition ovarian reserve scant , one available study show adverse effect . Furthermore , chance postoperative hemorrhage increase ( estimate 1 % ) . We believe , light burden risk , study justify since prophylactic removal Fallopian tube might diminish risk serous ovarian carcinoma ( life time risk around 1 % ) . ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS AND PUBLICATION 1 . Data collect participate hospital one study medical doctor . Together principal investigator ( ) access source data cod case number . The key code safeguard safe TweeSteden hospital , Tilburg , The Netherlands . Data human material keep seven year ( fifteen patient consent ) . Data security assure fact one medical doctor collect data . The privacy participant protect fact data cod . 2 . The investigator submit summary progress trial accredit METC year . Information provide date inclusion first subject , number subject include number subject complete trial , serious adverse event / serious adverse reaction , problem , amendment . 3 . The investigator notify accredit METC end study within period 8 week . The end study define last patient 's last visit . In case study end prematurely , investigator notify accredit METC , include reason premature termination . Within one year end study , investigator submit final study report result study , include publications/abstracts study , accredit METC . 4 . The data publish peer review medical journal well present abstract medical conference .</detailed_description>
