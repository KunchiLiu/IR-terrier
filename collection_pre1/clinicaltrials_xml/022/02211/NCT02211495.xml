	<brief_title>ULCERS - Electrical Stimulation Diabetic Foot Ulceration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes affect approximately 347 million people worldwide , 2030 WHO project diabetes 7th lead cause death . Diabetic foot ulcer estimate occur 15 % patient diabetes , often co-existing neuropathy peripheral vascular disease compromise limb 's ability heal . Foot infection cohort common , diabetic foot ulcer serve portal infective organism enter body . Unchecked , infection spread contiguously involve underlie tissue , include bone . A diabetic foot infection often pivotal event lead gangrene low extremity amputation . Diabetes account one million leg amputation every year , represent 60 % amputation develop country . Due potential rapid progression infection , gravity potential complication , diabetic foot problem handle aggressively community , low threshold referral secondary care . Out-patient clinic involve multidisciplinary team clinician , podiatrist vascular surgeon . Good foot care teach diabetic patient , treatment antibiotic , debridement revascularisation occur matter urgency appropriate . The device test mimic effect walk make foot twitch- increase blood flow limb exercise leg muscle . It hypothesise increase blood flow limb , much surgical revascularisation , aid legs ability heal fight infection . After training , use patient suitable out-patient therapy . The investigator wish evaluate short- longer-term effect neuromuscular stimulator diabetic foot ulceration therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
