	<brief_summary>Although approach reduce cardiovascular disease , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) remain leading cause mortality industrialize world . In order reduce deleterious effect atherosclerotic process , proposal non-pharmacological treatment use , cardiac rehabilitation program , emphasis exercise -based therapy . Traditionally aerobic exercise like biking , walk jogging conduct , however , alternative way aquatic exercise training propose , however , cardiorespiratory adaptation population well documented literature . Thus , aim study evaluate effect aquatic aerobic training ( AAT ) body composition , autonomic modulation heart rate ( HR ) cardiorespiratory metabolic variable patient CAD . This longitudinal clinical trial sample allocate convenience , twenty-one patient male , diagnosis CAD , divide control group ( CG study , n=8 ) , assess , train group ( TG , n=13 ) . All patient underwent assessment body composition , heart rate variability ( HRV ) rest supine posture , cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) , perform AAT program . The training protocol consist three session per week alternate day 16 week , total 48 session , last approximately one hour . The exercise intensity prescribe 80 110 % first ventilatory threshold ( VT1 ) obtain CPET . Given parameter represent risk marker cardiovascular event population study , result suggest AAT propose study may important therapeutic strategy incorporate cardiac rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Personal Data recording : - History : personal data , lifestyle food , family history , current previous history disease . - Physical examination : cardiac lung auscultation , measurement heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , body weight height . 2 . Assessments : All experimental procedure perform morning order minimize influence circadian cycle . The temperature experimental room maintain 22 ° C 24 ° C relative humidity 40 % 60 % . Patients familiarized experimental protocol , instruct ingest stimulant drink coffee , tea soft drink , drink alcohol , perform strenuous exercise ( 48 hour surgery ) , perform light meal least four hour collection . Aiming verify baseline condition suitable begin experimental procedure , patient remain 15 minute rest supine position , record blood pressure ( BP ) HR . After , perform : - Analysis body composition bioelectrical impedance analysis . - Registration HR NN interval ( NN ) rest , supine sit position . - Recording HR NN rest supine position , sit , stand respiratory sinus arrhythmia maneuver . - Spirometric test - Cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) . This submaximal CPET perform treadmill , order verify identify possible change hemodynamic , electrocardiographic induce physical exertion , aerobic functional capacity well prescribe physical training protocol . 3 . Training : After assessment volunteer train aerobic water base physical training program 4 week . 4 . Second assessment : Components first assessment repeat end month physical training .</detailed_description>
