	<brief_title>eHealth Intervention Promote Self-regulation Physical Activity Fruit Vegetable Intake Among Adults Who Visit General Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To increase effect size reach computer tailor intervention , theory self-regulation use , motivational volitional determinant target intervention serve stand-alone intervention deliver general practice . The intervention consist three session behaviour ( ie. , physical activity , fruit vegetable intake ) available website tablet deliver general practice . Adults start session one tablet general practice computer home , receive flyer general practice . In first session adult receive general information , monitor behaviour receive tailor feedback increase awareness . Adults also guide set goal self-efficacy increase modeling problem solve method . In second third session , adult evaluate reach goal , make cop plan adapt action plan . To ensure feasibility implement intervention general practice , general practitioner involve begin development . A three-arm clustered quasi-experimental design use evaluate effectiveness intervention . Therefore , general practitioner recruit patient randomly assign general practice level . Within practice , patient allocate three group . Group one intervention group general practitioner select motivate adult use intervention . In group two , selection motivation adult conduct researcher wait room finally , group three control group adult also select researcher . The distinction two intervention group make evaluate general practitioner influence recruit participant lead beneficial effect compare investigator recruit participant . Furthermore , also investigate implementation intervention general practitioner feasible . In intervention group , adult ask complete session one ( S1 ) measurement question tablet general practice refer fly computer home . Adults , use tablet , fill short questionnaire leave email address send reminder email complete session one home . In session one , adult choose behaviour ( ) want complete intervention . One week ( S2 ) one month ( S3 ) session one complete , adult receive email respectively start session two three chosen behaviour ( ) . In control group , adult fill questionnaire base line general practice home ( C1 ) one month post intervention ( C2 ) .</detailed_description>
