According model person-environment fit ( P-E fit ) , old adult risk poor outcome demand resource available live environment balance individual 's everyday competence ( ability solve problem associate everyday life ) . Community-dwelling old adult low level everyday competence little support risk nursing home transition . Conversely , old adult high level everyday competence live restrictive environment ( e.g. , nurse home ) may experience decline function result lack stimulation . Often , transition nurse home occur time crisis ( e.g. , acute hospital stay ) , leave little opportunity appropriate consideration individual 's current future level everyday competence . In VA , major focus minimize time spend CLCs provide rehabilitation service transition Veterans back community . The mission CLC program return Veteran high level well-being , thus maximize P-E fit . Despite , CLC staff Veterans face many barrier facilitate transition community ( e.g. , caregiving need , housing , etc. ) . Currently standardize process exists assure treatment planning include process maximize P-E fit ( e.g. , assess everyday competence , set resident-directed goal around rehabilitation need , develop care plan transition Veteran community whenever possible ) . The investigator ' team develop instrument allow provider assess everyday competence safe independent living community . However , ensure successful transition , assess everyday competence without intervention sufficient . Once CLC interdisciplinary team member understand resident 's everyday competence barrier transition , goal-setting must occur , focused rehabilitation goal care plan around transition community . The objective propose research develop effective feasible toolkit CLC interdisciplinary team use 1 ) ass Veteran 's everyday competence safe independent living ; 2 ) develop personally meaningful rehabilitation goal facilitate successful transition CLC base everyday competence ; 3 ) conduct structure care plan support resident goal around transition back community . With innovative consideration everyday competence goal-setting context , Veterans optimal P-E fit upon return community , thus ensure successful transition outcome ( i.e. , readmitted CLC within 90 day ) .</detailed_description>
