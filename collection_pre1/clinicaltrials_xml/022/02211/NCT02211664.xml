	<detailed_description>Ever since introduction , one major limitation endovascular therapy occurrence restenosis treatment . Factors contribute loss primary patency percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) due balloon injury negative arterial remodeling , excessive neointimal proliferation elastic recoil . In order increase sustain vessel patency , systemic medication administration brachytherapy propose , lead success . With introduction stent , patency rate optimize also long term . However , neointimal hyperplasia endovascular stent placement infra-inguinal artery remain major limit issue . Stents contribute excessive intimal formation vascular response metallic prosthesis . In order find solution overcome limitation , possibilities drug-eluting technology examine . Current concept include drug-eluting stent ( DES ) , provide sustain release anti-proliferative medication vessel wall . The application drug coat stent surface inhibits inflammatory response smooth muscle cell proliferation vessel wall certain period delay process intimal hyperplasia . Thus , DES technology develop prevent early restenosis late luminal loss potentially improve long-term patency rate . Because DES active stent coating show beneficial treatment coronary artery disease , technique active stent coating ( sirolimus paclitaxel ) commonly use coronary intervention transfer infrainguinal vascular bed . However , active stent coating ( sirolimus paclitaxel ) inhibit inflammatory response smooth muscle cell proliferation vessel wall certain period ; fact , merely delay process intimal hyperplasia demonstrate 2-year result SIROCCO study . Another novel way inhibit restenosis PTA use drug-coated balloon ( DCB ) , inhibit restenosis immediate local release medication intervention . The rationale behind use DCBs base finding sustain drug elution necessary obtain sustained inhibition restenosis . The concept use balloon medication treat vascular disease introduce 2003 Scheller et al . One commonly use drug arterial application anti-proliferative paclitaxel ( Taxol ) , impedes cell division cell cycle . Paclitaxel certain characteristic make promising candidate treatment peripheral arterial disease . Because hydrophobic , paclitaxel require use polymer prevent wash-off track implantation . Adequate drug delivery vessel wall possible lipophilic characteristic , enable paclitaxel interact high concentration lipids present vessel wall avoids need polymer . Results preclinical clinical study show short-term exposure Paclitaxel may suffice obtain sustained reduction late lumen loss avoid restenosis coronary peripheral artery : contrast stent , DCBs leave residual material artery lumen could trigger neointimal proliferation , thus make DCBs attractive alternative stent , especially challenge arterial anatomy . Further investigation warrant order obtain conclusive data . Furthermore , benefit treat in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) peripheral artery DCBs yet investigate , although limited data already available date . The clinical value drug-eluting technology prove repeatedly coronary artery , evidence therapeutic application peripheral artery disease start build . It intent prospective study evaluate treatment drug-coated balloon follow stent implant compare result 4EVER trial result literature .</detailed_description>
