	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) brain disease cause part head injury . The brain change CTE see autopsy . Researchers want test new brain scan help diagnose CTE live patient . Objective : - To determine new type brain scan detect change occur chronic traumatic encephalopathy . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 60 previous head injury participation certain sport . Design : - Participants screen : - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Tests think , mood , memory - 30-minute magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan . A magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . They get earplugs loud knock sound . - Visit 1 : Participants 70-minute PET scan brain small amount radioactive chemical . That inject intravenous tube ( catheter ) arm . A catheter also put artery wrist elbow . - Participants lie bed slide donut-shaped scanner . A plastic mask may mold face head . Vital sign heart activity check scan . - Blood urine take scan . - Participants check phone next day . - Visit 2 : Participants repeat Visit 1 different chemical artery catheter . - Visit 3 : Participants may spinal tap . Some fluid remove needle bone back .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine PET radioligand [ 11C ] PBB3 detect aggregate tau protein brain patient history traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) suspect chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) . Study population : The propose study include 40 subject . Twenty patient history TBI suspect CTE 20 healthy cognitively normal volunteer without history TBI . Design : Subjects undergo medical screening brain MRI neuropsychological testing perform . Subjects undergo one brain PET scan [ 11C ] PBB3 detect aggregate tau protein . Subjects also one brain PET scan [ 11C ] Pittsburgh compound B ( PIB ) detect amyloid plaque . Subjects ask lumbar puncture measure CSF tau concentration . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure amount [ 11C ] PBB3 bind brain . We quantify radioligand brain uptake , washout , plasma clearance , distribution volume use compartmental modeling . Distribution volume [ 11C ] PBB3 proportional density insoluble paired helical filament tau equal ratio equilibrium uptake brain concentration parent radiotracer plasma . As exploratory measure , determine relationship [ 11C ] PBB3 bind brain gray matter loss MRI . We also measure amount [ 11C ] PIB binding brain use Logan reference tissue method cerebellum reference .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; For patient : History head injury result past current participation one contact sport ( hockey , football , box ) . Patients may history structural brain injury ( i.e. , injury accompany abnormality MRI CT scan ) , concussion without structural injury ( mild TBI ) , repetitive subconcussive injury . Meets DMSV criterion Major Neurocognitive Disorder Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Age 18 60 year . Ambulatory . Patients unable provide inform consent must surrogate decision maker . For healthy control : Healthy without past present history brain disease . Age 18 60 year . Able provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Past present history brain disorder TBI . For patient : Subjects abnormal brain imaging finding suggest diagnosis TBI second lesion brain tumor addition change consistent TBI . For control : past present history either single concussion severe TBI , repetitive subconcussive injury due contact sport participation . Serious medical condition , make study procedure current study unsafe . Such serious medical condition include uncontrolled epilepsy multiple serious injury . The Principal Investigator protocol determine whether subject need exclude . The DSMV criterion Major Neurocognitive Disorder follow : Evidence significant cognitive decline previous level performance one cognitive domain ( complex attention , executive function , learn memory , perceptualmotor , social cognition ) base : Concern individual , knowledgeable informant , clinician significant decline cognitive function . A substantial impairment cognitive performance , preferably document standardized neuropsychological testing , , absence , another qualified clinical assessment . The cognitive deficit interfere independence everyday activity ( i.e . minimum , require assistance complex instrumental activity daily live pay bill manage medication ) The cognitive deficit occur exclusively context delirium . The cognitive disorder well explain another mental disorder ( e.g . major depressive disorder , schizophrenia ) . Criteria Mild Neurocognitive Disorder follow : There evidence modest cognitive decline previous level performance one domains outline base : Concern individual , knowledgeable informant , clinician . Decline neurocognitive performance , preferably document standardized neuropsychological testing , , absence , another qualified clinical assessment . The cognitive deficit insufficient interfere independence ( eg , instrumental activity daily live , like complex task pay bill manage medication , preserve ) , great effort , compensatory strategy , accommodation may require maintain independence . The cognitive deficit occur exclusively context delirium . The cognitive deficit primarily attributable another mental disorder ( eg , major depressive disorder , schizophrenia ) . There restriction medication . Since disease modify therapy tauopathies ( include CTE Alzheimer disease ) currently exist , currently available medication , either prescribed overthecounter , expect confound result study . Antiinflammatory medication , include NSAIDs , expect significantly reduce tau aggregation CTE patient , base failure medication prevent disease progression Alzheimer disease .</criteria>
