	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want develop good way treat cancer . In study , give people cancer two drug . These drug use treat blood cell cancer . Objectives : - To test safety efficacy drug combination bortezomib clofarabine . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 advanced cancer progress receive standard treatment effective therapy . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , scan measure tumor . They also heart , blood , urine test . All may do regular doctor . - Participants get study drug 21-day cyles . They stay clinic week 1 every cycle , 2 week . &lt; TAB &gt; - Bortezomib inject skin day 1 4 . &lt; TAB &gt; - Clofarabine inject vein day 1 5 . - During cycle 1 , participant go clinic doctor physical exam blood test start second third week . - Participants clinical evaluation throughout study , start cycle , receive treatment . - Participants may stay study long tolerate drug tumor get bad . - Participants follow-up 30 day last dose study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib purine nucleoside metabolic inhibitor clofarabine demonstrate great additive activity combination preclinical xenograft model , justify clinical evaluation combination antitumor activity OBJECTIVES : To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib clofarabine patient refractory solid tumor , lymphoma , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) ELIGIBILITY : - Study participant must histologically confirm solid tumor lymphomas myelodysplastic syndrome progress standard therapy know prolong survival standard treatment option exist - Age great equal 18 - No major surgery , radiation , chemotherapy within 3 week prior enter study - Adequate organ function STUDY DESIGN : - This open-label Phase I trial - The start dose clofarabine 1 mg/m2 administer intravenously day 1 5 21-day cycle ; bortezomib administer 0.8 mg/m2 subcutaneously day 1 4 21-day cycle . - Dose escalation follow 3+3 design , dose limit toxicity define cycle 1 . - Dose escalation proceed cohort comprise two separate group patient ( one group patient solid tumor/lymphoma one group patient MDS ) , least 1 group , hematologic DLT second grade 2 hematologic toxicity observe , point , dose escalation proceed separately two cohort : ( 1 ) patient solid tumors/lymphoma ( 2 ) patient MDS .</detailed_description>
