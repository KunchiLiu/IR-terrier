	<brief_summary>Background : &lt; TAB &gt; - Many people neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) get tumor nervous system . Finding malignant tumor early important removing . Researchers want find way scan genetic testing . Objectives : - To learn neurofibromatosis type 1 . Eligibility : - People age 10 old NF1 benign tumor malignant one . Design : - Participants screen another study medical history , physical exam , urine blood test . They magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - MRI : Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . They scanner 60 90 minute , lie still 15 minute time . Participants get earplugs loud sound . They get contrast agent ( dye ) thin plastic tube ( catheter ) insert arm vein . - As part regular care , participant : - FDG-PET/CT scan . They get radioactive glucose ( sugar ) catheter arm vein . - [ 18F ] -FLT-PET/CT scan . This like FDG scan different radioactive chemical . - Biopsy . A piece tumor tissue remove needle . A piece tissue previous biopsy may also study . - Participants may genetic testing . Blood take . It test along biopsy sample . Researchers explain risk procedure . They may notify participant test show health problem . - After study , participant continue regular cancer care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transformation Plexiform Neurofibromas Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors Neurofibromatosis Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - NF1 autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterize distinct feature include development benign plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) tumor nervous system . - Development MPNST typically result malignant transformation preexist PN . Associated symptom may overlap difficult distinguish growth benign PN . Currently surgery standard treatment PN MPNST . - The 5-year overall survival rate NF1 patient MPNST poor ; therefore , early detection malignant transformation PN important goal . - Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) NF1 utility detect malignant transformation . However , concern lesion high FDG uptake benign biopsy . - Fluoro-thymidine ( FLT ) PET measure cell cycle proliferation . Malignant lesion high proliferation rate benign tumor ; therefore , FLT-PET may sensitive specific early detection malignant transformation ass response . - Genetic analysis important component evaluate transformation PN MPNST . Biallelic NF1 tumor suppressor gene mutation ( p53 , INK4A , p27kip1 ) , increase Ras activity abnormal growth factor signal describe , know signature MPNST . - Massively parallel ( next generation ) sequence technology permit whole-genome , whole-exome transcriptome sequence multiple tumor include MPNST . Objectives : - Determine feasibility FLT PET patient NF1 MPNST lesion concern MPNST , MPNST . - Evaluate ability FLT PET distinguish benign PN malignant lesion , determine FLT PET accurate FDG PET correctly classify tumor benign malignant . - Evaluate feasibility whole-exome sequence genetic/genomic method , include detection epigenetic and/or expression change RNA Seq tumor ( MPNST lesion concern MPNST adjacent benign PN ) biopsies use interventional radiology sample technique consent individual NF1 participate 10-C-0086 . - Perform detailed clinical analysis individual NF1 MPNST lesion concern MPNST . - Perform detailed pathologic analysis biopsy specimens tumor area determine increase uptake FDG FLT predict malignant transformation . - Identify somatic genetic variant distinguish PN MPNST germline sequence whole-exome sequence potentially identify target treatment . Eligibility : - NF1 patient lesion concern malignancy active MPNST . - Willingness enroll NCI protocol 08-C-0079 : Natural History Study Longitudinal Assessment Children , Adolescents , Adults Neurofibromatosis Type 1 . Design : - Up 15 patient enrol pilot study . - Patients undergo follow evaluation : - Detailed clinical evaluation NF1 manifestation NCI protocol # 08-C-0079 - Imaging study include : - MRI , FDG-PET/CT scan ( standard care ) subject ; - [ ( 18 ) F ] -FLT-PET/CT ( research study ) subject 10 year age old - Genetic counseling ( participate germline blood sample biopsy analysis portion study ) - Tissue analysis : -- -Patients 18 year age old MPNST participate tissue analysis , consent appropriately preserve archival tissue available , patient agree optional research biopsy ( consent safe ) . Patients lesion concern malignancy undergo clinically indicated biopsy concern lesion adjacent benign PN ( consent safe ) detail pathologic analysis whole-exome sequencing ( co-enrollment 10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis Pediatric Solid Tumors Establishment Repository Related Biological Studies ) . Biopsies direct PET fusion image interventional radiology . - Whole-exome sequencing germline blood sample ( optional ) participate tissue analysis ( co-enrollment 10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis Pediatric Solid Tumors Establishment Repository Related Biological Studies ) . - To good characterize lesion concern MPNST predict high risk malignant transformation , correlate clinical imaging finding , include radiographic evaluation FDG-PET/CT , [ ( 18 ) F ] -FLT-PET/CT , pathologic evaluation tumor biopsy ( available ) , analysis whole exome sequence germline blood sample ( consent ) tumor sample ( available ) .</detailed_description>
