	<brief_title>Pilot Study PEMF Therapy Treatment Post-operative Pain Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site randomized , double-blinded , parallel-group prospective pilot study analgesic effectiveness twice-daily PEMF therapy treatment persistent post-operative pain follow Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Following run-in period 10 day collect baseline pain intensity score , activity level opioid consumption , eligible subject randomize 2:1 ratio receive therapy active PEMF device identical inactive Sham device . Subjects self-treat twice daily 60 day home . Subjects collect electronic patient-reported outcome ( ePRO ) data morning Day 75 . Subjects evaluate research center Interim Visits Day 21 , Day 41 , Day 61 Day 75 assessment safety , concomitant medication , range motion , weight , peripheral edema , quality life outcome . At Day 90 , Day 150 , Day 240 assessment pain intensity , opioid consumption , safety , review concomitant medication interval history perform , data collect via telephone contact .</detailed_description>
