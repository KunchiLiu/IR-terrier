	<detailed_description>The evaluation health risk among public consequence exposure radioactive fallout nuclear test important area research many year investigator Radiation Epidemiology Branch ( REB ) . As result reputation group field dose risk assessment relate radioactive fallout , expertise National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) cancer research , 2007 , U.S . Senator Jeff Bingaman ( D , NM ) send request NCI evaluate health risk New Mexico resident first nuclear bomb test ( name Trinity ) conduct 1945 south-central New Mexico . The NCI respond early 2008 preliminary evaluation radiation dose receive resident New Mexico . However , evaluation make special provision lifestyle diet tribal community member Hispanics\Latinos significant part population . Little known Native American Hispanic\Latino lifestyles diet mid-twentieth century , yet data necessary produce credible assessment health risk state population . For reason , REB investigator publish initial dose assessment peer-reviewed literature . Additionally , since statewide health record reconstruct meaningful way determine excess disease rate , estimation health risk population project ( i.e. , estimate ) base magnitude distribution radiation dose receive relationship radiation dose cancer risk observe population . Since preparation 2008 report , REB exposure assessment model use assess dos radioactive fallout nuclear test site improve publish peer-reviewed literature . The required improvement 2008 Trinity assessment would support publication project health risk include sex- age-dependent diet lifestyle model Native Americans Hispanics\Latinos New Mexico mid-1940s . We propose pilot study collect , via individual interview , information lifestyle diet 9 key informant Native Americans Hispanics\Latinos live New Mexico alive time bomb ( currently great equal 69 year old ) . This data inform design large study , collect lifestyle diet information series target focus group . The information acquire 9 individual interview use 1 ) determine feasibility assemble focus group member tribal Hispanic\Latino community New Mexico alive 1945 time bomb 2 ) provide lifestyle diet information use refining focus group interviewing tool .</detailed_description>
