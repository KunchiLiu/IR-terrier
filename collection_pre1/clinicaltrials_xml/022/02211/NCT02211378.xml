	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial aim determine stress response performance trainees observer simulation training similar trainee actively participate simulation train 'hotseat ' 3 consecutive simulation session . We hypothesize trainee experience less stress observer first 2 simulation session . However , place 'hotseat ' third session , stress response , well performance , similar trainee spend 3 simulation session 'hotseat ' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Stress Observers Their Subsequent Performance During High Fidelity Simulation-based Training .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : High fidelity simulation-based training ( SBT ) use sophisticated manikin instead real patient medical teach commonly practice worldwide . We previously show SBT cause significant stress trainee , evidence rise heart rate salivary cortisol ( ; repeat exposure SBT associate level stress , despite performance improve . From study , participant 'hot-seat ' actively manage clinical crisis experience high level stress benefit learn experience . However , stress experience observer ( room actively manage crisis ) learn outcomes study . Objectives : We aim determine : 1 ) If observer SBT experience less stress compare trainees 'hot-seat ' ; 2 ) trainee observer prior SBT session perform well trainees 'hot-seat ' subsequent SBT session . Methodology : Thirty-six trainee anaesthetist randomize 2 group undergo three SBT scenario . 18 Trainees randomize Observer group first undergo two SBT scenario observer follow third session 'hot-seat ' . 18 Trainees Control group undergo 3 session 'hot seat ' . For session , stress response measure salivary cortisol amylase performance measure use Anaesthetists Non Technical Skills ( ANTS ) score . Clinical Significance : If find trainees observer first 2 SBT scenario experience less stress 'hot-seat ' trainee yet achieve similar level performance third SBT session , potentially make SBT less stressful reduce total number simulation require , thus improve efficiency simulation training .</detailed_description>
