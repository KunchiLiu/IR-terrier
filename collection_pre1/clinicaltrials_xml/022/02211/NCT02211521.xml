	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy platelet-rich plasma versus hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection treatment osteoarthritis knee joint . The hypothesis PRP intra-articular injection comparable even well hyaluronic acid injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Autologous Platelet-rich Plasma With Hyaluronic Acid Treatment Osteoarthritis Knee Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) significant impact society . The limited regenerative capacity cartilage part problem . Existing degenerative lesion lead accelerate deterioration articular ( joint ) surface lead end-stage arthritis . In particular , recent knowledge regard tissue biology highlight complex regulation growth factor ( GFs ) normal tissue structure reaction tissue damage . The influence GFs cartilage repair widely investigate vitro vivo . Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) simple , low- cost minimally- invasive method allow one obtain natural concentrate autologous GFs blood , increasingly applied clinical practice treat knee degenerative pathology , chondropathy early OA . The biological rational PRP platelet contain storage pool GFs , cytokine , chemokines many mediators.Although widespread application , little high level study literature demonstrate real efficacy PRP . The investigator hypothesize intra-articular injection PRP treat knee osteoarthritis could determine pain relief recovery knee function overall clinical outcome comparable even good viscosupplementation , common injective approach apply kind pathology . To purpose investigator design double blind randomize control trial compare PRP v viscosupplementation .</detailed_description>
