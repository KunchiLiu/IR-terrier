	<detailed_description>Endovascular technique well accept treatment iliac occlusive disease . It show iliac artery especially stenoses short occlusion respond well percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) without stenting . Although hard data lacking , technical development introduction new stent type , complex lesion treat endovascular procedure . Although stent often use improve outcome PTA , general consensus whether stenting mandatory chronic iliac arterial occlusion . The , use stent , still unclear implant bare self-expandable stent , bare balloon-expandable stent cover stent . On one hand , randomize control Dutch Iliac Stenting trial fail demonstrate superiority primary stenting PTA additional stenting short lesion . On hand , several paper advocate bare stenting , trial conclude good result cover stent . The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus ( TASC ) work group publish 2000 recommendation management peripheral arterial disease . In order well reflect development technology technique , TASC work group revise updated recommendation TASC-II document 2007 . The treatment recommendation surgical percutaneous intervention propose involve peripheral arterial bed base upon several factor availability expertise percutaneous conventional vascular surgical technique , patient 's preference importantly lesion 's morphology . TASC classify lesion different bed type A D. In general , endovascular therapy treatment choice TASC A &amp; B-lesions surgery prefer good-risk patient TASC C lesion TASC D lesion . For aorto-iliac lesion , TASC-II classification follow : Type A lesion 1 . Unilateral bilateral stenosis Common Iliac Artery ( CIA ) . 2 . Unilateral bilateral single short ( ≤3 cm ) stenosis External Iliac Artery ( EIA ) . Type B lesions 1 . Short ( ≤3 cm ) stenosis infrarenal aorta . 2 . Unilateral CIA occlusion . 3 . Single multiple stenosis total 3-10 cm involve EIA extend Common Femoral Artery ( CFA ) 4 . Unilateral EIA occlusion involve origin Internal Iliac Artery ( IIA ) CFA Type C lesions 1 . Bilateral CIA occlusion 2 . Bilateral EIA stenoses 3-10 cm long extend CFA 3 . Unilateral EIA stenosis extend CFA 4 . Unilateral EIA occlusion involve origin IIA and/or CFA 5 . Heavily calcified unilateral EIA occlusion without involvement origin IIA and/or CFA Type D lesions 1 . Infra-renal aortoiliac occlusion 2 . Diffuse disease involve aorta iliac artery require treatment 3 . Diffuse multiple stenosis involve unilateral CIA , EIA CFA 4 . Unilateral occlusion CIA EIA 5 . Bilateral occlusion EIA 6 . Iliac stenoses patient Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) require treatment amenable endograft placement lesion require open aortic iliac surgery The TASC work group base recommendation literature available date generally consider guideline follow . Nevertheless state feasible treat good technical success sustain durability TASC type C D lesion endovascular way . Recent publication finally start show excellent durability iliac stenting daily practice . Park et al , describe long term ( 10 year ) experience total cohort iliac patient ( TASC type A-D lesion ) present impressive primary patency rate 87 % , 83 % , 61 % 49 % respectively 3 , 5 , 7 10 year index intervention . De Roeck et al . publish result stenting different type iliac occlusion ( TASC type B-D ) , show primary patency rate 94 % , 89 % 77 % respectively 1 , 3 5 year follow . They could also show cohort patient complex aorto-iliac lesion , stent-failures always endovascularly rescue . They show secondary patency rate 100 % 1 year 94 % 3 5 year . Bosiers et al . conclude BRAVISSIMO trial primary patency rate 12 month TASC A , B , C D lesion respectively 94.0 % , 96.5 % , 91.3 % 90.2 % . Leville et al . questioned presentation outcome stenting iliac occlusion ( primary patency rate 76 % secondary patency rate 90 % 3 year ) , whether endovascular treatment iliac occlusive disease extend Type C D lesion . Leville come conclusion could detect significant difference outcome primary secondary patency rate stratify TASC classification . They summarize treatment iliac artery occlusion accomplish via endovascular mean little morbidity acceptable patency rate . The COBEST trial demonstrates cover bare-metal stent produce similar acceptable result TASC B lesion . However , cover stent perform good TASC C D lesion bare stent longer-term patency clinical outcome . Sabri et al . conclude use cover balloon-expandable kissing stent atherosclerotic aortic bifurcation occlusive disease provide superior patency 2 year compare bare metal balloon-expandable stent . Bosiers et al . experienced implantation Advanta V12 PTFE-covered stent iliac occlusive disease show safe feasible excellent clinical result 1 year investigate patient cohort . The TASC stratification important tool allow u assess extent lesion morphology , extensive lesion preclude successful endovascular treatment . They continue fate limb dictate infrainguinal disease often present patient complex iliac occlusion therefore believe endovascular attempt exhaust attempt open surgical repair iliac occlusion decrease perioperative morbidity good mid-term durability .</detailed_description>
