	<brief_title>National Epidemiologic Survey Incidence Perioperative Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This survey anticipate enroll 2208 patient elective surgery general anesthesia 28 hospital China . After obtain approval Ethical Committee relate research involve human subject , investigator enroll patient accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The tympanic temperature monitor following time point respectively : Arriving wait area , enter OR room , 5 min anesthesia induction , every 15 min operation , 2h tympanic temperature monitor every 30 min , Tympanic temperature also take surgery complete patient arrive PACU . Other information also collect include type dosage anesthesia drug , duration surgery anesthesia , patient warm method，operation room temperature , amount infusion intravenous fluid blood warm technique whole operation procedure . The postoperative follow-up conduct record within 30 day operation ( implantation surgery , follow-up conduct within 90 day postoperatively ) include ICU stay , hospital stay , wound infection , new cardiovascular events.etc . The contract research organization delegate site monitor month ( online monitor week ) hospital participate survey recruitment perform source data validation time review relate medical record , source data case report form , etc.to ensure data accuracy completeness . Data management conduct whole survey procedure . In order guarantee validation data , two data manage staff input verify data independently . Statistical analysis software ( SAS9.2 ) use calculation statistical analysis . The number case , mean , standard deviation , median value , maximal value minimal value calculate description qualitative parameter . Number case percentage use description classification parameters.Two side test use statistical test , P &lt; 0.05 indicates difference statistically significant ( unless indicate otherwise ) , 95 % confidence use confidence interval .</detailed_description>
