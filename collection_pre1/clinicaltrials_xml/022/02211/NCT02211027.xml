	<brief_summary>Hypothesis The incidence toxicity patient receive tumor DNA-transfected fibroblast vaccine acceptably low immunologic response rate sufficiently high warrant study therapy The study vaccine proceed two stage method Simon ( 102 ) . In first stage , 15 patient accrue treat . If two few objective immunologic response occur , study terminate . If 3 response observe , study proceed second stage , accrue additional 22 patient . If second stage complete total 9 immunologic response observe among 37 patient treat , treatment response rate vaccine consider high enough warrant study . Conversely , evaluation vaccine conclude first stage , 8 few total immunologic response occur complete second stage , vaccine consider study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Vaccine : Semi-allogeneic Human Fibroblasts ( MRC-5 ) Transfected With DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution open-label phase Ib clinical trial design determine safety immunization patient resect Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) lethally irradiate semi-allogeneic human fibroblast ( MRC-5 ) transfected DNA derive subject 's tumor measure immune response autologous tumor vaccine . Briefly , plan use two-stage trial design initially enroll 15 patient Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The patient undergo surgical resection provide complete removal primary lesion negative gross microscopic margin . A portion primary tumor specimen necessary pathologic diagnosis obtain serve source DNA preparing vaccine . Each DNA-based vaccine contain 1 x 10e7 DNA-transfected human allogeneic fibroblast . The vaccine lethally irradiate used immunization . It administer intradermally Outpatient Clinic total four vaccination deliver weekly interval . Patients delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) responses tested eligibility criterion . Immunologic response vaccine evaluate . If evidence toxicity , &gt; 3 15 initial patient show immunologic response , second stage study open accrual 22 patient . To determine patient 's response DNA-based vaccine , frequency T cell reactive recipient cell transfected autologous tumor DNA measure ELISPOT IFN-y compare response non-transfected fibroblast prior vaccination . All patient monitor Immunologic response assay include ELISPOT , flow cytometry lymphocyte marker , Annexin V binding , TcR expression , caspase3 activity serum antibody .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathological stage IIVa HNSCC The subject must complete removal primary HNSCC lesion negative gross microscopic margin . Documentation margin frozen section surgery recommend . Patients already surgery available banked tumor sample enrol AFTER surgery . At least 18 year age . Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 70 Adequate hematologic function : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 1,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Liver function test : Bilirubin ( total ) &lt; /=1.7 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 252 u/L SGOT &lt; 108 u/L Kidney profile : Serum electrolytes Sodium 136146 mEq/L Potassium 3.55.0 mEq/L Bicarbonate 2131 mEq/L Chloride 98107 mmol/L Serum creatinine &lt; 3 x ULN BUN 826 mg/dL At least 12 week interval elapse prior surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy treatment first vaccination . Patients recover surgery adjuvant treatment . The effect tumor DNAtransfected fibroblast vaccine develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 4 month last dose study vaccine , even oral contraceptive use . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion tumor DNAtransfected fibroblast vaccine administration . Patients EXCLUDED participation study follow apply : One Inclusion Criteria meet . A significant history current evidence cardiac disease include , limited : congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , angina pectoris , uncontrolled hypertension , serious arrhythmias myocardial infarction within previous six month . Evidence ongoing active infection require antibiotic therapy . Active intracranial metastasis . Patients previously resect intracranial disease and/or previously irradiate intracranial metastasis clinically stable four week eligible . Pregnant lactating woman . Pregnant woman exclude study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test per standard care prior surgery tumor removal . A second pregnancy test must perform 7 day prior first vaccination must negative . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . Patients require systemic corticosteroid ( unless patient corticosteroid within 4 week prior start study ) . Autoimmune disease include , limited , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematous , multiple sclerosis , ankylose spondylitis . Patients postobstructive pneumonia serious infection time registration serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . No prior malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least 5 year prior registration . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study . HIV test perform patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate per medical record review . Patients clinical symptom Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C test , clinically indicate per medical record review . Positive result exclusion criterion</criteria>
