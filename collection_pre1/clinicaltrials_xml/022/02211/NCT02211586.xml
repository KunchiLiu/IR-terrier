	<criteria>Healthy subject patient T1DM eligible enrollment study meet follow criterion : Cohort A : male female patient T1DM duration &gt; 1 year , determine medical history physical examination , receive basal insulin . The following insulin permit patient prepared transition daily injection insulin glargine evening combine prandial insulin use : Glargine ( split dose ) , Detemir ( split dose ) , Neutral Protamine Hagedorn ( split dose ) , regular ( split dosing ) , Insulin pump rapid act insulin . Cohort B : overtly healthy male female , determine medical history physical examination . male patient : agree use reliable method birth control study 3 month follow last dose investigational product . Cohort B subject require use birth control receive study drug study . female patient : woman childbearing potential ( woman surgically sterilize menarche 2 year postmenopause ) test negative pregnancy time screen base urine pregnancy test agree use reliable method birth control ( example , use oral contraceptive , Norplant® , contraceptive transdermal patch ; reliable barrier method birth control [ diaphragms contraceptive jelly ; cervical cap contraceptive jelly ; condom contraceptive foam ] ; intrauterine device ; sexual abstinence , partner vasectomy ) study time complete follow visit .

Menopausal woman include woman either : 1. spontaneous amenorrhea least 12 month , induce medical condition anorexia nervosa take medication amenorrhea induce amenorrhea ( example oral contraceptive , hormone , gonadotropin release hormone , antiestrogens , selective estrogen receptor modulators , chemotherapy ) 2. spontaneous amenorrhea 6 12 month folliclestimulating hormone level great 40 million international units/mL . age 18 60 year age , inclusive , screen . body mass index 19 30 kg/m2 , inclusive . clinical laboratory test result within normal reference range population investigator site , result acceptable deviation judge clinically significant investigator . venous access sufficient allow blood sample IV administration per protocol . reliable willing make available duration study willing follow study procedure . give write informed consent approve Lilly ethical review board ( ERB ) govern site . Cohort A ( patient T1DM ) require glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ≤9.5 % . Cohort A Patients T1DM Cohort B Healthy Subjects Healthy subject patient T1DM exclude study enrollment meet follow criterion : investigator site personnel directly affiliate study immediate family . Immediate family define spouse , parent , child sibling , whether biological legally adopt . Lilly , Translational Research Institute , University Wisconsin ( UW ) Office Clinical Trials , UW Nutritional Sciences , UW Health West Endocrinology Clinic , Covance employee currently enrol clinical trial involve investigational product offlabel use drug device , concurrently enrol type medical research judge scientifically medically compatible study . participate , within last 30 day , clinical trial involve investigational product . If previous investigational product long t1/2 , 3 month 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) pass . person previously complete withdrawn study study investigate LY2605541 , previously receive investigational product . abnormal blood pressure clinically relevant study determine investigator . Patients antihypertensive medication eligible inclusion study , dose antihypertensive medication must stable for1 month must change study . history presence cardiovascular , respiratory , hepatic , gastrointestinal , endocrine ( except T1DM , Cohort A ) , hematological , neurological disorder capable significantly alter absorption , metabolism , elimination drug ; constitute risk take study medication ; interfere interpretation data . intend start new concomitant medication study , include overthecounter herbal medication ( vitamin/mineral supplement , occasional acetaminophen permit ) . The use topical medication may also permit evidence risk systemic absorption exist chronic dosing . intend make dietary change study , may opinion investigator impact body weight result study . previous history heart disease include atrial fibrillation , QT prolongation , angina . regularly use know drug abuse and/or show positive finding urinary drug screening . show evidence human immunodeficiency virus infection and/or positive human immunodeficiency virus antibody . show evidence hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibody . show evidence hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen . woman positive pregnancy test woman lactate . average weekly alcohol intake exceed 21 unit per week ( male ) 14 unit per week ( female ) , unwilling stop alcohol consumption duration study ( 1 unit = 12 oz 360 mL beer ; 5 oz 150 mL wine ; 1.5 oz 45 mL distilled spirit ) . triglyceride level &gt; 400 mg/dL ( &gt; 4.5 mmol/L ) ; triglyceride &gt; 400 mg/dL , one retest allow , per investigator discretion .

Cohort A Patients T1DM know allergy LY2605541 , related compound component formulation , history significant atopy . previous history family history deep vein thrombosis . previous history proliferative retinopathy . require treatment drug insulin treat diabetes . poorly control diabetes know poor awareness hypoglycemia . 1 episode severe hypoglycemia ( define require assistance due neurologically disable hypoglycemia ) within last 6 month . 2 emergency room visit hospitalization due poor glucose control ( hyperglycemias diabetic ketoacidosis ) within last 6 month . level insulin resistance , insulin sensitivity , responsiveness insulin ( base insulin dos ) , opinion investigator , would impact study result . use ßblockers medication report impact hypoglycemia awareness within 4 week dose , study . require use diuretic within 4 week dose , study . regularly use intend use nutritional supplement , systemic corticosteroid , overthecounter prescription medication affect blood glucose body 's sensitivity insulin promote weight loss within 4 week dose , study . Patients agree stop take supplement prior screen permit discretion investigator . Thyroxine replacement therapy , hormone replacement therapy permit , however patient must stable dose least 6 week prior dose . unwilling transition single daily injection insulin glargine even prior enrollment . suffer significant blood loss donate blood 500 mL within last month . Cohort B Healthy Subjects use , intend use overthecounter medication within 7 day prescription medication within 14 day start respiratory quotient measurement ( apart contraceptive medication , vitamin/mineral supplement , occasional acetaminophen ) .</criteria>
