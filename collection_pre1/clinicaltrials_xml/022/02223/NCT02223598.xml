Female subject need negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day study enrollment ( applies subject childbearing potential . Non‑childbearing define ≥ 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) . 16 . Willing able provide write Informed Consent adhere study procedure . 1 . Subjects leukemia exclude , exception chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , allow dose escalation phase . Subjects Burkitt lymphoma , plasma cell leukemia , POEMS syndrome ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin change ) , amyloidosis also exclude . 2 . Clinically active central nervous system ( CNS ) cancer involvement . Imaging exclude CNS involvement require . 3 .
