	<detailed_description>Background : Arthritis prevalent disable source chronic pain African Americans ( AAs ) bear disproportionate burden . The purpose study test patient-centered , non-invasive intervention improve pain outcome reduce disparity AA White Veterans knee arthritis . The intervention design help Veterans develop positive mindset , health benefit well-documented . Objectives : The primary aim study evaluate impact positive intervention pain physical functioning AA White Veterans knee arthritis randomize , control , clinical trial . It hypothesize patient randomized positive activity ( PA ) intervention experience improve pain functioning compare patient randomized attention control ( AC ) program , improvement large AA WH Veterans . The secondary aim study identify variable mediate effect PA intervention pain functioning . It hypothesize effect PA intervention mediate psychosocial variable know associated arthritis outcomes racial difference arthritis outcome ( e.g. , depression , self-efficacy , pain coping , perceive discrimination ) . Methods : A randomized , control , 2-arm design use compare effect 6-week PA intervention AC program pain function 1 , 3 , 6-months post-intervention among AA WH Veterans knee arthritis . Approximately 180 AA 180 WH primary care patient knee pain symptom consistent arthritis recruit participate VA medical center follow original protocol . [ Due accelerate recruitment original target sample , approximately 240 additional primary care patient knee pain symptom consistent OA recruit participate VA medical center use inclusion criterion take account original ICD-9 code correspond ICD-10 code . The additional patient ( include men woman , resource allow ) recruit increase power detect sex difference secondary analysis primary aim study achieve use original cohort . ] Eligible participant complete in-person baseline assessment study outcome , mediator , control variable randomize 6-week PA AC program . The PA program consist complete 6 at-home activity ( 1 per week ) show increase positivity . The AC program consist 6 affectively neutral activity . Both group receive weekly telephone call trained interventionists clarify instruction next week 's activity ass completion previous week 's activity . Outcomes propose mediate variable assess via telephone survey 1 month , 3 month , 6 month post-intervention . Study outcomes include self-reported pain physical functioning measure Western Ontario MacMaster Index . Hypothesized mediator include depressive symptom , positive/negative affect , satisfaction life , arthritis self-efficacy , pain coping , pain catastrophizing , perceive discrimination , global stress , social support . The intervention impact time race ( primary aim ) test use linear mixed model allow repeat measure continuous outcome participant assess change outcome time . A multiple mediator bootstrap approach ass whether effect intervention mediate hypothesized mediator .</detailed_description>
