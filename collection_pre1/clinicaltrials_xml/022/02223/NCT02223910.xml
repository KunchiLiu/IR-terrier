	<brief_summary>Background : The technology brain-computer interface ( BCI ) enable monitor brain activity generation real-time output specific change activity pattern . The recorded subject receive feedback neural activity associate his/her effort thus learn voluntarily modulate brain activity . There accumulate evidence training motor cortex activation brain-computer interface system enhance recovery stroke patient . Here propose new approach train resting-state correlate motor performance instead activation related movement . Previous study show resting-state alpha oscillation motor cortex coherent rest brain , good stroke patient perform motor task . Furthermore , observational study suggest train alpha-band coherence motor cortex neurofeedback beneficial effect motor performance . Objective : This randomize control study aim test usefulness training functional connectivity motor cortex rest brain brain-computer interface patient chronic stroke . We hypothesize network variant neurofeedback train lead region frequency specific increase functional connectivity improve function affect upper extremity . Methods : 10 patient chronic stroke significant unilateral deficit upper extremity motor function perform two period neurofeedback train randomize cross-over design . In one period , train alpha-band coherence intact area around affected motor cortex rest brain . In control period , train alpha-band coherence control region directly relate motor function ( medial prefrontal cortex healthy hemisphere ) rest brain . In period , two training session per week perform 4 week . The period separate least 4 week . Oscillations brain reconstruct 128 EEG channel use adaptive spatial filter coherence target area rest brain calculate real time . Coherence magnitude display form cursor computer screen . Significance : This study may provide causal evidence role functional connectivity motor learning may lead new strategy rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
