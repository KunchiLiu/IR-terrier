	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , include coronary heart disease ( CHD ) stroke , lead cause morbidity mortality . Dyslipidemia long recognize important risk factor development atherosclerosis human being . In Taiwan , rate hypercholesterolemia ( ≧250mg/dl ) 4.3 % 5.5 % 1970 ; 12.99 % 1980 ; 17.1 % 1990 . Those hypertriglyceridemia ( ≧200 mg/dl ) 6.5 % 11.1 % 1970 13.0 % 1990 . Low serum HDL-C isolate independent coronary risk factor among good number Taiwanese people . Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) statins last decade become part standard treatment regimen patient dyslipidemia . However , embarrass , insufficient data clinical use Taiwan . It necessary rationalize balanced guideline management dyslipidemia Taiwan , base local epidemiological , clinical basic research data . Because trial conduct Caucasians large-scaled end-point research lipid lower therapy ( LLT ) publish Asians , registry study attempt define status lipid lower therapy Taiwan effect LLT CVD morbidity mortality large population patient receive primary secondary prevention therapy . The medication depend decision make primary care physician . The patient physician decide withdrawn registry time reason . The lipid profile change , myopathy , liver enzyme change LLT also record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This registry study define status lipid lower therapy Taiwan effect LLT CVD morbidity mortality large population patient receive primary secondary prevention therapy . The medication depend decision make primary care physician . The patient physician decide withdrawn registry time reason . All potential patient screen eligibility screen visit . Those fill inclusion criterion screen invited registry study different group . The follow-up take place yearly thereafter 5 year , clinical visiting , phone follow-up , record NHIB Taiwan . At clinical visit , vital sign , clinical endpoint , adverse event , concurrent medication information laboratory specimen obtain complete possible . With phone record NHIB , clinical endpoint record . If primary care physician intend treat patient 's lipid profile target , he/she add , delete adjust LLT his/her clinical judgement .</detailed_description>
