	<brief_summary>The objective randomized clinical study evaluate effect systemic administration moxifloxacin compare amoxicillin plus metronidazole combined non-surgical treatment patient generalize aggressive periodontitis ( GAgP ) 6-month follow-up . A total 40 systemically healthy patient GAgP evaluate randomize clinical trial . Periodontal parameter ( plaque index , gingival index , probe depth , bleed probing , clinical attachment level ) record baseline , 1st , 3rd 6th month . Patients receive either 400 mg moxifloxacin per os daily 500 mg metronidazole 500 mg amoxicillin per o three time daily 7 day consecutively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The American Academy Periodontology European Federation Periodontology report patient GAgP may benefit adjunctive administration antibiotic . Antibiotics use adjunct nonsurgical treatment either locally systemically . Systemic antimicrobial agent adjunct nonsurgical treatment provide additional benefit mechanical therapy alone term probe depth reduction periodontal attachment gain . Amoxicillin moderate spectrum , bacteriolytic β-lactam antibiotic , metronidazole active anaerobic bacteria nitroimidazole . scale root plan combination metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy find effective suppress P. gingivalis eradication A. actinomycetemcomitans prevent re-colonization A. actinomycetemcomitans synergistic effect combination wide spectrum activity . It find superior azithromycin , doxycycline , metronidazole treatment GAgP . Quinolones introduce use urinary tract infection 1970s . Moxiflocaxin fourth generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic exhibit good tissue penetration high oral bioavailability improve activity Gram- positive , aerobic anaerobe . Moxifloxacin use systemic treatment respiratory infection , acute sinusitis , odontogenic abscess , osteomyelitis mandible locally treatment ophthalmic infection . Moxiflocaxin good activity putative periodontal pathogen , include Porphyromonas gingivalis , Tanneralla forsythia , Prevotella spp , Fusobacterium nucleatum , Actinomyces spp , Campylobacter rectus , Peptostreptococcus spp . Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , locate within biofilm intracellulary . It show A.a. strain highly susceptible fluoro-quinolones ciprofloxacin moxifloxacin . Some adjunctive antibiotic secrete saliva insufficient concentration inhibit A.a. Moxifloxacin seem secrete saliva high level plasma may also concentrate site infection since penetrates polymorphonuclear granulocytes epithelial cell . Moxifloxacin find superior clindamycin , metronidazole doxycycline . Systemic administration moxifloxacin adjunct scale root plan find effective compare scale root plan alone scale root plan conjunction doxycycline treatment severe chronic periodontitis . To best knowledge , study evaluates effect moxifloxacin adjunct scale root plan treatment GAgP . The aim single center , randomize clinical study evaluate impact adjunctive systemic moxifloxacin compare use adjunctive systemic amoxicillin metronidazole full-mouth scaling root plan success treatment patient GAgP 6-month follow-up . The hypothesis use adjunctive systemic moxifloxacin would provide similar clinical result adjunct systemic amoxicillin metronidazole scale root planing . This study single-center , randomize , parallel-design clinical trial 6 month follow-up . It conduct Kocaeli University , Faculty Dentistry , Department Periodontology 2011-2013 . The study protocol approve Ethics Committee Medical Faculty Kocaeli University ( KOU KAEK 5/9 ) conduct accordance Helsinki declaration 1975 , revise 2000 . The GAgP patient recruit patient seek periodontal treatment Kocaeli University , Faculty Dentistry , Department Periodontology , Kocaeli , Turkey . Approximately , 12.000 patient screen date June 2011 September 2012 . A complete medical , dental , periodontal radiographic examination perform . The study protocol explain patient . From patient willing participate study , write informed consent obtain include study . The periodontal diagnosis subject GAgP establish basis clinical radiographic criterion define 1999 International World Workshop Classification Periodontal Diseases Conditions . Patients include 18 35 year age otherwise healthy . The bone loss estimation radiographically perform patient assessment extent severity alveolar bone loss . Medical dental history question . Subjects exclude know systemic disease condition can/could influence periodontal status ( cancer , cardiovascular respiratory disease ) , history hepatitis HIV infection , immunosuppressive chemotherapy , current pregnancy , plan pregnancy lactation , requirement antibiotic prophylaxis , oral disease GAgP , ongoing orthodontic therapy , history antibiotic therapy periodontal treatment within precede six month . Subjects exclude known allergy quinolones penicillin metronidazole . Periodontal Examination The full-mouth clinical periodontal measurement record 6 site per tooth ( mesio-buccal , mid-buccal , disto-buccal , disto-lingual , mid-lingual , mesio-lingual ) include plaque index ( PI ) , gingival index ( GI ) , probe depth ( PD ) , bleed probe ( BOP ) clinical attachment level ( CAL ) . CAL calculate cement-enamel junction base periodontal pocket . Williams periodontal probe use periodontal measurement . All measurement scale root planing perform single calibrate trained periodontist standardize manner . Allocation concealment The patient randomly assign one study group . To ensure complete mask allocation , recruitment patient , forty identical , opaque-colored , impermeable plastic bag include toothbrush , interproximal brush , toothpaste either moxifloxacin amoxicillin metronidazole prepare cod . A code number give subject . Randomization cod keep separately clinical evaluation form one author treatment follow-up visit complete . The examiner perform treatment unaware allocation . Prior treatment , subject go motivation session oral hygiene . Following periodontal measurement , full-mouth supragingival scale use ultrasonic scaler polishing perform , toothbrush , toothpaste interproximal toothbrush provide subject . One week later , patient examine plaque accumulation oral hygiene . The patient maintain proper oral hygiene exclude study . Only 39 patient fulfil qualification criterion enrollment present study . Subjects randomly assign receive one two treatment group . Moxifloxacin group receive scale root plan adjunctive systemic antibiotic , 400 mg moxifloxacin , day 7 day amoxicillin metronidazole group receive combination 500 mg amoxicillin 500 mg metronidazole three time per day 7 day . The subject instruct take first dose antibiotic morning first session since microorganism organize root surface protect antimicrobial agent . Scaling root planing perform 2 consecutive day 24 hour local anesthesia . On day , scale root planing perform 2 quadrant use ultrasonic scaler manual instrument . The endpoint scale root plan tactile smooth root surface . The subject insistently inform intake antibiotic properly , ask inform research need take another antibiotic anti-inflammatory agent another reason follow study 6 month . Patients use 0.2 % chlorhexidine digluconate rinse twice day month brush teeth tooth brush interproximal tooth brush twice day . Patients ask report adverse event side effect antimicrobial agent soon possible . Subjects monitor one week second scaling root plan session . At session , antibiotic intake , adverse event side effect question ; oral hygiene plaque accumulation control . Subjects screen 1 , 3 6 month completion nonsurgical treatment . During session , clinical periodontal parameter , medical history change , especially , whether antibiotic therapy prescribe reason record . At end session , supragingival scaling perform , need . The present study conduct within clinic , patient take dental chair treat experienced periodontist discard discrepancy provide standardize controlled environment . Sample size calculation The primary outcome variable probe depth change . The sample size calculate base previous information study conduct department , use data relative mean difference standard deviation ( SD ) experimental period probe depth parameters.57 Considering mean probe depth difference 1.3 mm evaluation period , estimate 13 patient group would necessary provide 95 % power ( 0.54 SD , α error 0.05 , β error 0.2 ) .58 However , aim recruit 20 patient group lose follow patient study .</detailed_description>
