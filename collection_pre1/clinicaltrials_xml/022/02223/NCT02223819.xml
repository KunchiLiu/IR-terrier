	<brief_title>Crizotinib High-Risk Uveal Melanoma Following Definitive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanoma common primary intraocular malignancy adult , arise melanocyte within choroid plexus eye . Melanomas ocular adnexal structure comprise approximately 5 % melanoma biologically prognostically distinct cutaneous melanoma . In United States , estimate 2000 patient diagnose disease year . The development metastasis disease common occur approximately 50 % patient posterior uveal melanoma within 15 year initial diagnosis treatment . Uveal melanoma think particularly resistant systemic treatment , systemic therapy yet demonstrate improve survival . Drugs commonly use treat advance cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable response patient uveal melanoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary diagnosis uveal melanoma least 12 mm large basal diameter clinically determine treat investigator . Cytologic determination diagnosis require . Size base clinical assessment ( e.g . ultrasound direct ophthalmoscopy ) prior enucleation radiation therapy . Definitive therapy primary uveal melanoma either surgery radiotherapy must perform within 90 day initiate protocol therapy . Highrisk ( class 2 ) uveal melanoma determine gene expression profile ( GEP ; DecisionDxUM , Castle Biosciences Inc , Friendswood , TX ) . No evidence metastatic disease . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 ( Karnofsky ≥ 70 % . Life expectancy great 3 month . Able swallow retain orallyadministered medication clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowels Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000 cells/mm³ Platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm³ Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dL AST and/or ALT &lt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin &lt; 2x ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 2x ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min Note : Patients hyperbilirubinemia clinically consistent inherit disorder bilirubin metabolism ( e.g. , Gilbert syndrome ) eligible discretion treat physician and/or principal investigator . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 4 month completion crizotinib administration . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior study entry . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study therapy , 4 month completion crizotinib administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . History another malignancy except diseasefree 3 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or patient indolent secondary malignancy require active therapy , eligible . Consult study Principal Investigator unsure whether second malignancy meet requirement specify . Any major surgery extensive radiotherapy ( except require definitive treatment primary uveal melanoma ) , chemotherapy delay toxicity , biologic therapy , immunotherapy within 21 day prior initiation study therapy . History prior crizotinib use . Use investigational drug within 28 day ( five halflives , whichever short ; minimum 14 day last dose ) precede first dose study therapy study . Have know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate crizotinib . Concurrent administration crizotinib strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A ( see Appendix B ) permit . Many overthecounter dietary supplement also inhibit induce CYP3A ( see Appendix C partial list ) thus prohibit . A QT interval correct heart rate use Bazett 's formula QTcB ≥ 480 msec . Concurrent administration crizotinib agent cause QTc prolongation ( see Appendix B ) permit . Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection ( exception chronic clear HBV HCV infection , allow ) . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction crizotinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
