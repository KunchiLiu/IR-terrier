	<brief_summary>1 . Background : Over 1 million intravitreal injection perform annually United States . The devastate complication relate injection endophthalmitis , incidence 0.02 - 0.1 % per injection . Techniques aim prevention complication study , though emergence rate antibiotic resistant bacteria single clinic population compare antiseptic technique iodine vs. use post-injection second generation fluoroquinolones report literature . 2 . Objectives : The purpose study help determine best way prevent infection limit antibiotic resistance patient receive eye injection . 3 . Procedures Involved ( Research Interventions ) : After patient chosen base inclusion criterion agree participate study , exclusion criterion review , cognizance determine , informed consent HIPAA compliance form sign . At point prior instillation ophthalmic medication , Rayon swab pass along inferior fornix study eye patient look examiner lower low eyelid . The swab use inoculate chocolate agar blood agar culture plat glass slide . These bring FMO microbiology department culture Gram stain . All Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative Staphylococcus specie identify subjected sensitivity test use Gram Positive antibiotic panel available Loma Linda , addition ciprofloxacin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bacterial Resistance Patients Receiving Post-Intravitreal Injection Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate bacteria eye may become resistant antibiotic use injection compare bacteria find untreated eye . However , study publish date compare resistance rate eye iodine-based preparation use , standard care , antibiotic also give injection single practice set . This important issue , resistant bacteria cause infection damage difficult treat non-resistant bacteria . Moreover , previous study focus emergence resistance fourth generation fluoroquinolones include moxifloxacin gatifloxacin , though use second generation fluoroquinolones still practice United States retina specialist , include investigator institution . Currently United States , 81 % retina specialist give antibiotic eye injection , although result several large study suggest practice reduce rate endophthalmitis compare use iodine alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients choroidal neovascularization due wet agerelated macular degeneration cause , clinically significant macular edema cystoid macular edema age 18 treat least 3 monthly intravitreal injection antiVascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( antiVEGF ) agent last 6 month . These injection must give either Dr . Fan 's clinic use povidoneiodine postinjection topical ciprofloxacin 0.3 % 4x daily 3 day , Dr. Rauser 's clinic povidoneiodine apply injection site conjunctival fornix postinjection antibiotic give .
