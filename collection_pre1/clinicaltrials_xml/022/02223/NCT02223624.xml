	<brief_summary>Many study show exercise train beneficial patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) . Heart Foundation guideline strongly recommend regular physical activity referral specifically design rehabilitation program patient CHF medically stable . Such program usually comprise aerobic exercise walk , light weightlift care avoid heavy straining due stress may place heart . Eccentric contraction muscle lengthen contract . Exercise involve eccentric contraction know increase muscle strength type exercise also require less oxygen . This require less power resist lower weight lift weight . Initial evidence suggest form exercise favourable outcome frail elderly chronic disease . This study aim determine eccentric exercise apply patient heart failure increase physical function use less energy exercise tolerable patient complain significant breathlessness fatigue . This study also aim determine eccentric exercise safe alternative exercise option patient risk negative event . The investigator propose run randomise controlled trial . Eccentric exercise deliver group heart failure patient refer exist heart failure rehabilitation program Northern Hospital . The program consist eight week twice weekly exercise one hour 's duration comprise eccentric exercise combine walk light weight training . This compare group patient participate current exercise program consist light weightlift aerobic exercise length duration exercise also third group patient wait list 8 week . Following completion eight week wait period , patient offer option join standard exercise program . The investigator expect eccentric exercise group improve walk capacity quality life compare traditional program wait-list control group . It also possible difference eccentric traditional program term functional outcome participant report eccentric exercise easier .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND A systematic literature review conduct yield two trial investigate eccentric exercise patient coronary artery disease two trial chronic heart failure population . Eccentric exercise report safe form exercise coronary patient , cause minimal heart breathe stress perceive `` fairly light '' exertion . Eccentric exercise , compare concentric exercise ( shorten contraction ) result comparable improvement muscle strength walk distance , often reduce oxygen usage . With increase negative event coronary patient , recently eccentric exercise trialed heart failure patient . One trial look six-minute walk test difference patient mild heart failure follow program eccentric concentric cycling . They find although group improve walk distance , eccentric exercise complete low level work stable heart rate . A second trial complete eccentric exercise descend stair , compare participant climb stair measure knee muscle strength . They report participant find stair descend easy significant improvement static strength eccentric ( lengthen ) concentric ( shorten ) force . Both study limit population small number ( 12-15 ) participant primarily male , poorly define mild heart failure . RESEARCH AIMS Given limit evidence coronary patient specifically heart failure patient , current study aim fill knowledge gap look effect eccentric exercise male female , mild moderate heart failure , heart failure types- systolic ( heart contraction problem ) diastolic ( heart relaxation problem ) . We aim include measure function quality life . We also monitor compliance patient satisfaction aim develop safe tolerable exercise program feasible implementation heart failure rehabilitation program . METHODS Participants recruit The Northern Hospital heart failure outpatient medical clinic also referral current rehabilitation program follow inpatient admission G.P referral . This study prospective , three-armed , parallel-design , randomise control trial 1:1:1 ratio . A separate randomisation procedure prepare three include New York heart association heart failure class disease severity affect result . As well primary outcome walk capacity quality life , secondary outcome include low limb strength level fatigue . We also monitor adherence , attendance , pain , adverse event occur session . Demographic outcome data analyse group difference baseline . To determine whether group 1 improve group 2 3 immediately 8-week program , data analyse analysis covariance use baseline measure covariates . Categorical outcome variable ( death hospital admission ) analyse relative risk ratio . To avoid bias maximise randomisation process , intention treat analysis utilise . Participants withdraw project follow possible . Where data missing , carry forward technique use , assume miss data remain constant . Finally , correlation secondary outcome variable primary outcome variable also examine detect association exist well association outcome type heart failure ( systolic diastolic ) . Significance level P &lt; .05 use hypothesis test .</detailed_description>
