	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Tumor Associated Peptide Antigen ( TAPA ) pulse dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine treatment progressive and/or refractory hematologic malignancy ( HM ) . We hypothesize treatment patient relapse and/or refractory HM , without available potentially curative treatment option , whose neoplastic cell express least one ( 1 ) TAPA define panel TAPAs , use low-dose cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) follow autologous , monocyte-derived , TAPA-pulsed DC vaccine low-dose granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) , result TAPA-specific T-cell response without significant toxicity . We also hypothesize CD4+ T-cell CD8+ T-cell response generate specific TAPAs may translate clinical antitumor activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose progressive and/or refractory hematologic malignancy , fail conventional therapy potentially curative therapeutic option available , candidate Phase I/II study . Following confirmation disease progression and/or refractoriness , eligible patient agree participate sign consent form neoplastic cell and/or blood analyzed expression specific panel Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens ( TAPAs ) , include SP17 , Ropporin , AKAP4 , PTTG1 Span-xb . Patients whose tumor express one ( 1 ) TAPAs receive three ( 3 ) day subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) increase bone marrow production monocyte dendritic cell ( DC ) precursor , peripheral blood mononuclear cell obtain phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis generation autologous DCs . Patient 's DCs generate Kiromic 's Cell Processing GMP facility , accord establish Standard Operating Procedures , activate pulsing/loading TAPA ( ) relevant particular patient . Patients receive five ( 5 ) day low-dose cyclophosphamide prior vaccination TAPA-pulsed DCs decrease Treg activity . TAPA-pulsed DCs administer fix dose 1 x 107 DCs least two ( 2 ) day follow cyclophosphamide administration . DC vaccination schedule every fourteen ( 14 ) day via subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) injection total 6 vaccination . Low dose GM-CSF also administer SC five ( 5 ) consecutive day , start three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) hour TAPA-pulsed DC treatment , optimize immune response DC viability vivo . Patients follow weekly basis ( frequently require ) evaluate treatment-related toxicity . Immune response anti-tumor response evaluate per protocol specification . Continuation stop rule study define base toxicity/tolerability ( Phase I ) and/or immune efficacy ( Phase II ) .</detailed_description>
