	<brief_summary>Due prevalence worldwide , osteoporosis consider serious public health concern . The worldwide annual incidence Osteoporotic fracture approximately 2 million US . Hip fracture associate serious disability excess mortality . Studies show initial osteoporotic fracture major risk factor new fracture . An increase risk 14.8 % secondary hip fracture demonstrate people already sustain fracture past 4 year ( In average ) . These data indicate major opportunity afford secondary fracture prevention strategy . By respond first fracture , reduce incidence second subsequent fracture . However , even longer medical follow-up accord regular standard care , medical treatment rehabilitation , medical system unable translate eminent risk effective preventive treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secondary Fracture Prevention Patients Who Suffered From Osteoporotic Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : - To create treatment , follow rehabilitation protocol patient suffer hip fracture , order prevent secondary fracture . - To demonstrate combine treatment Hip Fractures Clinic well regular standard treatment rehabilitation suggest Bone Health Clinic ( addition standard medication prescribe osteoporosis ) result significant reduction second subsequent fracture . Study Protocol : 1 . The study protocol begin patient , admit primary hip fracture ( osteoporotic nature ) , surgically treat ( customary standard care ) . 2 . According hospitalization standard protocol , patient treat vitamin D calcium . For first month patient give load dose 70,000 unit . For next month patient receive 50,000-80,000 unit per month . In addition , patient treat Calcium Pills ( Caltrate TAB 600mg , day ) 3 . In addition clinical customary monitoring test perform hospitalization , Biomarkers safety assessment take : 1 . Vitamin D 2 . Bone Markers - Bone marker take three day patient admit , one time six month later ( part follow visit ) . 4 . Follow visit hospitalization due surgery primary hip fracture . 1 . Follow visit Hip Fracture Clinic occur interval : six week , 3 month , 6 month year , since patient release hospitalization . At follow visit , patient assess physical examination , hip X-ray rehabilitation progression Questionnaire ( HHS ) . 2 . Follow visit Bone Health Clinic occur 6 week 3 month since patient release hospitalization ( part regular standard care ) . 3 . A 3cc Serum sample take purpose serve future study examine new marker bone marker SCLEROSTIN . There use sample . The sample remain deep freeze temperature ( CËš70- ) .</detailed_description>
