	<brief_summary>The overall goal project identify genetic , hormonal , neurobiological influence paternal nurturing behavior determine father ' neural response infant modulate neuropeptides know play role parent experimental animal model . The aim determine pharmacological manipulation central oxytocin ( OT ) vasopressin ( AVP ) level influence neural response view picture one 's infant hearing cry stimulus . In double-blind procedure , father 1-3 year old child scan two separate occasion ; influence OT/AVP influence placebo . Fathers randomize either OT AVP , order administration drug placebo counterbalance across subject . Fathers scan view picture unknown child listen unknown infant cry stimulus . The investigator hypothesize : - OT augment ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , ventral striatum medial orbitofrontal cortex ( mOFC ) response view picture one 's child , augment primary auditory cortex ( AI ) response father infant cry . - AVP augment lateral septum response view child picture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>30 father child age 1-3 participate two functional image sequence ( fMRI ) session , influence OT/AVP , influence placebo . Fathers restrict men live biological child adult partner ( male female ) commit relationship . All father receive two fMRI scan two different occasion , separate 2-10 day . 15 father randomize intranasal OT , 15 randomize intranasal AVP . Within drug group , order administration drug placebo counterbalance across subject , 15 receive OT/AVP first , 15 receive OT/AVP second . During fMRI scan , father view picture unknown child , well unknown adult . Afterwards , still scanner , listen infant cry control stimulus . After exit scanner , father listen cry stimuli rate emotional reaction cry stimulus follow dimension use 7 point likert scale : irritated , sympathetic , alarmed , angry , upset , compassionate , distress , annoy , tender .</detailed_description>
