	<brief_title>Effect ACT-451840 Against Early Plasmodium Falciparum Blood Stage Infection Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study characterize activity ACT-451840 administer orally clearance Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites blood healthy subject .The inoculum use blood stage Plasmodium falciparum challenge ( BSPC ) contain estimate 1,800 viable parasite-infected erythrocyte dilute 2 mL normal saline injection . Blood collect malaria parasitemia assessment polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Parasitemia ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL indicated subject treat ACT-451840 . If PCR count &gt; 5,000 parasites/mL symptomatic dose within 24 hour . Subsequent PCR blood sampling perform prior ACT-451840 dosing 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 , 96 , 120 , 144 hour post-dosing approximately time per week 2 consecutive negative sample , Riamet® rescue treatment final visit .</detailed_description>
