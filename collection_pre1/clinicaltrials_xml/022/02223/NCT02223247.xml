	<brief_summary>This first human phase 1 study TVB-2640 conduct patient advanced stage solid malignant tumor . This research do find safe useful TVB-2640 patient receive previous cancer therapy , therapy exists would curative might provide significant benefit . TVB-2640 belongs class drug call fatty acid synthase inhibitor ( FASN inhibitor ) . This mean interfere body 's ( tumor 's ) ability use substance call fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) . Research show tumor appear need FASN keep grow .</brief_summary>
