	<brief_summary>This study investigate use new drug target DNA repair pathway AZD6738 , ATR inhibitor ) . Many tumour lose important DNA repair function rely heavily remain repair pathway survive . Preclinical study indicate , tumour , prevent function remain pathway lead tumour cell death , spar normal cell . This study aim investigate safety tolerability new drug patient advance cancer , well combination palliative radiotherapy , drug may increase effectiveness radiotherapy prevent repair radiationinduced DNA damage . As drug give small number patient , study focus safety find correct dose proceed study , although preliminary sign drug activity also examine . The initial part study administer increase dos drug group patient advance cancer standard anticancer treatment option available . Testing establish whether drug level body tumour adequate drug effect , toxicity assess . After recommend dose establish , recommend dose schedule stablished trialing different schedule . Participants test see tumour lack main DNA repair pathway ( predict well response drug ) . Finally , drug give patient advanced cancer require course radiotherapy symptom control - drug test different dos different dos radiotherapy . Side effect monitor test establish whether drug enhance radiotherapy effect tumours normal tissue .</brief_summary>
