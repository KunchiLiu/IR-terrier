	<detailed_description>Background Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) frequently medical intervention perform worldwide . Coronary heart disease ( CAD ) remain leading cause death , although advance management acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) reduce in-hospital mortality 16 % mid-1980s around 4 6 % . Several breakthrough account improvement cardiovascular outcome , include use improvement coronary stent antiplatelet therapy . Regarding stent , bare metal stent first introduce associate high risk restenosis , something successfully addressed introduction drug-eluting stent . All benefit shortcoming newly introduce device drug therapy evaluate large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Registries provide useful insight novel association address RCT . The aim CARDIOBASE Bern PCI registry collect baseline clinical procedural data well assess clinical outcome patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention Bern University Hospital . All patient undergo PCI without stent implantation prospectively register . Device use accord decision treat physician independent registry . Objective Prospectively collect baseline clinical , procedural clinical outcome discharge one year order ass safety efficacy PCI Bern University Hospital . Methods ECGs patient analyzed correlation clinical outcome data perform . Outcomes compare different clinical subgroup . The impact stent device implant anti-platelet therapy regimen cardiovascular outcome assess .</detailed_description>
