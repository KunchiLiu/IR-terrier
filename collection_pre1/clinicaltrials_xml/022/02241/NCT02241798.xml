	<brief_summary>The primary goal study assess effect pre-oxygenation oxygen carbon dioxide level seizures patient admitted Epilepsy Monitoring Unit ( EMU ) . The investigator hypothesize provide oxygen prior seizure help eliminate drop change see seizure , drop oxygen saturation increase carbon dioxide level . Research do patient admit EMU specifically seizures occur record video electroencephalography ( vEEG ) , research intervention use oxygen prior seizure . The importance research relate phenomenon sudden unexplained death epilepsy patient ( SUDEP ) . SUDEP case typically patient epilepsy find dead family morning , without clear cause death . The risk SUDEP high 9.3 per 1000 person-years ( Shorvon Tomson 2011 ) . There may multiple mechanism SUDEP occur , however leading hypothesis decrease ventilation seizure lead hypoxia . Blood oxygen saturation level find decrease significantly 25-50 % patient shortly seizure monitor hospital . In rare situation , significantly lower oxygen level may trigger cascade event body may able recover , lead SUDEP . In animal model , provide oxygen prior seizure occur show eliminate oxygen desaturation , importantly eliminate mortality animal prone death due seizure . Pre-oxygenation standard procedure rapid-sequence induction anesthesia reduces risk oxygen desaturation apneic period procedure . On room air , estimate duration safe apnea 1 minute , increase 8 minute follow pre-treatment high FiO2 ( Weingart Levitan 2012 ) . This primarily due oxygen replace nitrogen within alveolus , create reservoir oxygen within lung transfer bloodstream continue despite lack ventilation . The apneic episode seizure benefit principle . The main purpose Epilepsy Monitoring Unit ( EMU ) evaluate patient well characterize seizure , identify main seizure focus . In addition standard EEG electrodes scalp , patient require invasive localization epileptic focus surgically place electrode within skull ( often refer GRID patient ) within brain , goal able resect area causing seizure . To identify seizure originate electrically , require seizure occur vEEG procedure . To provoke seizure , medication typically lower , partial seizure secondary generalization full tonic-clonic ( GTC ) seizures occur . Prior research show oxygen desaturation 90 % occur complex partial seizure , hypoxia common profound GTCs . Some center use oxygen saturation CO2 monitor standard care , NYULMC investigator also capability clinical usage . Oxygen currently mandate standard-of-care , often provide nasal prong follow seizure part post-ictal nursing care , though outcome data support use . It unknown whether pre-treatment oxygen reduce rate oxygen desaturations clinically , see animal model , goal research project .</brief_summary>
