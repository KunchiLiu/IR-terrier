	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study individual poor pulmonary function secondary TIS benefit expansion thoracoplasty . The investigator specific aim : 1 . Record pulmonary function thoracic volume TIS patient enrollment serial observation 2 . Offer expansion thoracoplasty therapy TIS patient 1. poor pulmonary function enrollment 2. progressive decline pulmonary function 3. progressive chest wall and/or spinal deformity 4. lack appropriate increase thoracic volume growth 3 . Document efficacy expansion thoracoplasty TIS patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedures 1 . Patient Identification &amp; Enrollment Patients meet inclusion criterion invite enroll study describe . 2 . Serial clinical observation Patients follow time progression thoracic insufficiency indicator : - Worsening respiratory status oFrequent respiratory infection oElevated rest respiratory rate oEase fatigability oHypoxia hypercapnia oMarionette sign ( trunk shoulder elevation depression respiration ) - Primary diaphragmatic breathing ( loss chest wall mobility ) - Progressive scoliosis - Failure thoracic dimension increase growth Patients progressive thoracic insufficiency offer surgical intervention expansion thoracoplasty utilize VEPTR device . Studies standard care TIS utilized ass patient . Routine standard care study obtain : 1 . MRI spine obtain presentation . 2 . Chest CT scan ( every 2 year , less frequently clinically indicate ) 3 . AP/Lat spine xrays ( include chest wall ) 1 . Will obtain every 6 month - 12 month 2 . If patient VEPTR implantation , typical schedule radiograph would include immediate postoperative xrays ( day surgery and/or early postoperative period ) 6 week , 12 week , 6 month postoperative . 3 . VEPTR lengthen typically take place every 6 month initial VEPTR implantation . i.Xrays obtain every 6 month association VEPTR lengthening . ii.Once VEPTR lengthening longer clinically indicate , patient follow xrays every 6-24 month skeletal maturity . d.Pulmonary function test ( spirometry ) obtain every 6-12 month child old enough participate ( typically &gt; age 4 year ) . e.Arterial and/or capillary blood gas a.Blood gas obtain every 6-12 month clinically indicate perioperatively VEPTR implantation / lengthening . f.Routine vital sign include rest pulse oximetry ( SaO2 ) a.Will assess clinic visit perioperatively g.All mentioned study obtain less frequently clinically indicate . 3 . Expansion thoracoplasty VEPTR implantation subsequent lengthen VEPTR perform follow informed consent . The surgical technique describe Campbell.3 The VEPTR device lengthen 6 12 month interval thoracic spinal deformity stabilize radiographically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pediatric patient , age range 6 month 17 year thoracic insufficiency syndrome ( TIS ) consider inclusion . Categories TIS include : 1 . Flail chest syndrome 2 . Constrictive chest wall syndrome ( rib fusion scoliosis ) 3 . Hypoplastic thorax syndrome ( Jeune 's syndrome , achondroplasia , Jarcholevin syndrome , Ellis van Creveld syndrome ) 4 . Progressive scoliosis/kyphosis congenital , neurogenic , idiopathic origin without rib anomaly 5 . Early onset scoliosis without rib anomaly high risk progression Failure meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
