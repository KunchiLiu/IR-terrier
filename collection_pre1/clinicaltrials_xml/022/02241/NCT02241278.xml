	<brief_summary>The analgesic property ketamine associate non-competitive antagonism N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ; receptor exhibit excitatory function pain transmission binding seem inhibit reverse central sensitization pain . In literature , value anesthetic preemptive analgesia control postoperative pain uncertain . The objective study ascertain whether preoperative low-dose ketamine reduces postoperative pain morphine consumption adult undergo colon surgery . In double-blind , randomize trial , 48 patient study . Patients ketamine group receive 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine surgical incision , control group receive normal saline . The postoperative analgesia achieve continuous infusion morphine 0.015 mg∙kgˉ¹∙hˉ¹ possibility 0.02 mg/kg bolus every 10 min . Pain assess use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , morphine consumption , hemodynamic parameter 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 hour postoperatively . We quantify time rescue analgesic ( Paracetamol ) , adverse effect patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In spite technique disposal elementary nature incisional pain , optimal pain management remain challenge . Because severity early postoperative pain relate residual pain type surgery , perioperative pain management considerably influence long-term quality life patient . Woolf , 1983 , first introduce theory preemptive analgesia attenuate postoperative pain , confirm presence central factor post-injury pain hypersensitivity experimental research . After , experimental study show various anti-nociceptive method apply injury effective reduce post-injury central sensitization contrast administration injury . After activation C-fibers noxious stimulus , sensory neuron become sensitive peripheral input , process call central sensitization . 'Wind , another mechanism activate spinal sensory neuron , see reiterate stimulation C-fibers . These sensitization produce c-fos expression sensory neuron , related activation N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) neurokinin receptor . These gene produce long-lasting change pain-processing system , result hyperexcitation . According Wall , protection sensory neuron central sensitization may provide relief pain surgery . Based assumption , preemptive analgesia recommend effective aid control postsurgical pain . NMDA antagonist demonstrate block induction central sensitization revoke hypersensitivity establish . Ketamine old drug increasingly consider treatment acute chronic pain . Its pharmacology mechanism action NMDA receptor antagonist adequately know , clinical practice present irregular result . Since ketamine NMDA-receptor antagonist , suppose avoid revoke central sensitization , thus attenuate postoperative pain . This antihyperalgesic action achieve small dos require anesthesia . Small-dose ketamine specify 1 mg/kg give iv bolus , high 20 µg∙kgˉ¹∙minˉ¹ give constant infusion . Low-doses preemptive ketamine administer iv seem reduce postoperative pain and/or analgesic consumption . According one study , single dose ketamine 1 mg/kg , administer conjunction local anesthetic , opioids anesthetic , provide good postoperative pain control . Regardless overwhelm effectiveness preemptive ketamine animal experiment , clinical report mix ; author describe positive effect others . While early review clinical finding mostly contradictory , still conviction effectiveness preemptive analgesia . To knowledge , prior control study determine effectiveness preoperative low-dose iv ketamine contrast placebo adult open colon surgery . Thus , clinical trial design examine postoperative analgesic effectiveness opioid-sparing effect single low-dose iv ketamine contrast placebo administer preoperatively .</detailed_description>
