	<brief_summary>Rationale - Statement Problem . Low back pain significant societal problem United States , affect approximately one-fourth Americans give time . Non-pharmacological therapy well study although preliminary evidence show utilization brace may beneficial reduce pain medication usage . - Hypotheses Key Question . The investigator hypothesize use inelastic lumbar brace may decrease opioid use chronic low back pain patient stable opioid regimen . The investigator propose conduct randomize control study test hypothesis . - Specific Objectives . AIM 1 : To evaluate opioid consumption chronic low back pain patient stable opioid regimen three arm trial , intervention in-elastic lumbar brace , elastic abdominal binder ( standard care ) , brace ( control ) . AIM 2 : To evaluate change secondary endpoint pain intensity , quality life , functional capacity . Long Term aim : To decrease patient 's chronic pain level , improve overall daily function , decrease overall opioid intake improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance Low back pain ( LBP ) common problem society potential significant morbidity mortality . One treatment LBP , opioid therapy , increasingly utilized noncancerous pain,1 4.2 % prevalence United States alone.2 The long term use opioids carry risk adverse event risk addiction.3 Thus , lack evidence base research treatment LBP , rise epidemiology LBP US , rise cost medical care , along potential risk opioid therapy , attention need draw find affordable alternative . Our study propose evaluate whether inelastic lumbar brace reduce chronic opioid use chronic low back pain population . The specific aim project perform pilot study assess feasibility project plan large randomize control trial . Additional long-term goal study assess effect inelastic lumbar brace chronic LBP population , significant decrease opioid use subsequent control reduction pain . Secondary endpoint note improvement functional outcome quality life measure . The finding preliminary study conduct VA facility provide data perform large multi-center randomized control trial prepare NIH proposal study benefit inelastic lumbar bracing . ( 3 ) Work Accomplished ( ) New submission : Preliminary study conduct yet . ( b ) Submissions Following Pilot Studies : Sponsored new study ( 4 ) Work Proposed This trial prospective randomize three armed trial in-elastic lumbar brace group ( BG ) , elastic abdominal binder ( EG ) , control group [ brace ] ( CG ) treatment chronic low back pain patient prescribe chronic opioid medication follow-up monitor 12 month .</detailed_description>
