	<brief_title>Predicting Aortic Stenosis Progression Measuring Serum Calcification Propensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Clinical Background Aortic stenosis common valvular heart disease important public-health problem . It present approximately 25 % adult age &gt; 65 year . Decisions surgical interventional aortic valve replacement base symptom measure valvular ventricular function use echocardiography . Such valvular affection result chronic progressive disease , usually start hemodynamically non-significant aortic sclerosis , progress severe stenosis year . There uniform pattern progression . Instead , mark difference individual , also time course disease observe . Aortic sclerosis progress mild aortic stenosis &lt; 15 % patient 2 7 year . Once moderate stenosis present ( jet velocity &gt; 3 m/s ) , average progression 0.3 m/s per year , still highly variable . When peak jet velocity exceed 4 m/s , survival free symptom valve replacement significantly reduce . In past , several prospective study perform enhance predictability disease behavior . Some determinant rapid progression adverse outcome identify , : age , gender , cardiovascular risk factor , B-natriuretic peptide , stenosis severity , degree valvular calcification others . Although appear progression rapid degenerative calcific disease congenital rheumatic disease , predict progression individually still prone large error even consider determinant . Therefore , regular clinical follow-up mandatory patient asymptomatic aortic valve affection . In patient aortic sclerosis without severe stenosis , desirable find strong predictor rapid disease progression . This would allow anticipate cardiovascular deterioration identify individual particular risk . Background Tissue Calcification From biochemical histological point view , aortic sclerosis valvular disease characterize focal plaque-like lesion contain microscopic calcification . Because calcium phosphate concentration serum near supersaturation , balance inhibitor promoter critically influence development calcification . The serum protein fetuin-A major systemic inhibitor calcification . Together additional blood component , fetuin-A prevents supersaturated calcium phosphate precipitate form soluble colloidal protein-mineral nanoparticles therefore integral part defense system prevent calcification . Low serum concentration fetuin-A associate reduce capacity inhibit calcification vitro . Calcification take place humoral line defense overwhelm . Koos et al . show serum level calcification inhibitor fetuin-A associate progression aortic valve calcification major adverse clinical event , independent renal function inflammation . A novel vitro blood test develop Pasch et al . provide overall measure calcification propensity monitor maturation time ( T50 ) calciprotein particle . First publish clinical data indicate T50 test helpful biomarker prediction future vascular calcification . Study Endpoints - Index test ( parameter evaluate ) : T50-Test - Comparator test ( test define disease status ) : Primary : Progression peak aortic jet velocity one year ( m/s per year ) Secondary : Progression peak aortic jet velocity &gt; 20 % one year ( dichotomized primary comparator ) Combined endpoint : death , hospitalization , aortic-valve replacement , heart failure , angina , syncope Inclusion Criteria - Patient refer routine clinical echocardiography Department Cardiology , Inselspital Bern - Aortic sclerosis without stenosis - Written inform consent Exclusion Criteria The goal recruit population comprise large variety clinical condition . Exclusion criterion : - Age &lt; 18 year - Aortic valve replacement schedule within 1 year inclusion - Any aortic valvular disease degenerative sclerotic , bi- unicuspid valve - Known disease expect survival &lt; 1 year - Known malignant tumor - Subvalvular obstruction ( LVOT ) mean pressure gradient &gt; 10mmHg Echocardiography Patients examine standard echocardiography include comprehensive assessment cavity wall dimension , ventricular valvular function , morphologic appraisal pressure prediction . In particular , peak aortic jet velocity record use CW Doppler window yield high velocity signal . Aortic stenosis severity measure use peak flow velocity ( m/s ) . Progression express peak flow velocity change per year ( m/s per year ) . Aortic valve sclerosis assess visually short axis accord Rosenhek : 1 , calcification ; 2 , mildly calcify ( small isolate spot ) ; 3 , moderately calcify ( multiple large spot ) ; 4 , heavily calcify ( extensive thickening calcification cusp ) . T50-Test The addition calcium phosphate serum trigger formation primary calciprotein particle ( CPP , see figure 2 3 ) . As nano-suspension calcium-phosphate , particle represent defense mechanism serum calcification . Primary CPPs undergo spontaneous transition secondary CPPs . The formation particles represent calcification . In T50-Test , time elapse transformation 50 % particle measure specific individual serum . The blood-sample take immediately completion echocardiographic exam . Objective The purpose study patient aortic sclerosis without stenosis establish independent predictor progression aortic valve obstruction use new calcification propensity measure serum . Methods Recruitment 200 consecutive patient refer routine clinical echocardiographic exam show vary degree aortic sclerosis include .</detailed_description>
