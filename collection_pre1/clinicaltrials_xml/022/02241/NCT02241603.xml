	<brief_summary>Obesity common problem Veteran population least 1 3 Veterans obese . When obese people eat food less response area brain sense pleasure ( reward ) . Decreased pleasure response food predict future weight gain . It known poor brain response reversible obese people 's brain respond way . Insulin brain regulate brain 's sensing pleasure . As people gain weight function insulin become impaired . The investigator study impaired function insulin related poor brain response food brain response predict voluntary intake food response diet . The investigator also study improve function insulin weight loss improves brain response . These study improve understand weight loss difficult inform u improve insulin signal potential way treat obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Reward</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current research proposal investigate relationship insulin sensitivity brain reward signal . In obese individual , insulin signaling impaired ( insulin resistance ) . Preclinical animal study suggest insulin resistance brain region important reward contribute overeat . This proposal aim test hypothesis human determine characteristic pertinent clinical outcome ( food intake weight loss ) . In human increase body mass index ( BMI ) weight gain occur decrease food consumption-induced neural activation ( consummatory reward ) caudate dorsal striatum . It speculate diminished consummatory reward cause overeat prevents weight loss , however , hypothesis directly test . Further , mechanism impair food consumption-induced neural activation obesity investigate . The primary research outcome propose study : 1 ) insulin sensitivity determine hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp , 2 ) food consumption-induced neural activation determine blood-oxygen dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( BOLD fMRI ) scanning , 3 ) caloric intake buffet meal , 4 ) weight loss weight loss intervention . Based screen baseline outcome assessment half participant enrol weight loss intervention repeat outcome measure intervention . Others complete baseline outcome measure . Secondary measure study include whole brain activation analysis , neuroendocrine hormone measurement time imaging , psychometric measure include eat behavior personality characteristic , measure reward sensitivity .</detailed_description>
