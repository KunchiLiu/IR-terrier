	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) costly complication may cause significant morbidity increase cost care , particularly colorectal surgery . Microbial sealant ( MS ) new class wound barrier aim decrease SSI , however evidence benefit clean Class 1 procedure . Based success Class 1 procedure , hypothesize microbial sealant could reduce rate SSI half clean contaminate colorectal procedure ( Class 2 ) .</brief_summary>
