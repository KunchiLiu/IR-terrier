	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-centred , non-randomized study investigate safety performance VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™ . The study shall blind prior , post procedure . All patient undergoing procedure require arteriotomy range 18 24 F , via common femoral artery screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . If patient meet requirement clinical investigation , shall invite participate , provide informed consent shall subsequently assign subject number . All subject shall immediately post procedure , 24 hour , 1 , 3 12 month follow-up assessment . Safety data follow-up assess Data Safety Monitoring Committee .</detailed_description>
