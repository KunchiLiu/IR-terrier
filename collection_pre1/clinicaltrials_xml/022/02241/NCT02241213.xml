	<brief_summary>Aphasia one disabling complication language production patient leave hemisphere stroke . About 19 % patient experience aphasia may spontaneously recovery several week month . Some study report repetitive low frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS-r ) patient ischemic stroke generates leave modulation cortical excitability facilitate promote functional reorganization recovery language production . In spite , study patient post-stroke aphasia , small case series without control correspond descriptive design perform long-term follow . Currently population heterogeneous respect etiology , type stroke aphasia severity ; also several author conclude exact location site , would possible neuronavigation technique , obtain good result . OVERALL OBJECTIVE Determine efficacy repetitive low-frequency TMS oral language recovery post-ischemic stroke patient non-fluent aphasia ESPECIFIC OBJETIVES - Estimate effect repetitiveTMS treatment right Lowe Frontal Gyrus ( GFI ) , evolution neuropsychological language test result patient non-fluent aphasia , compare placebo . - Describe behavior depression anxiety level treatment group ( active placebo ) , Zung anxiety depression test , establish correlation production test language . - Evaluate effect repetitiveTMS technique compare placebo , overall functionality subject Barthel scale . - Describe impact language behavior quality life patient treat placebo active EMT , assess EuroQol test . METHODOLOGY A placebo double blind control randomize trial , evaluate efficacy low frequency EMT-r language recovery 100 patient first ischemic stroke event among first 4-8 month postinfarction non-fluent aphasia . The patient agree sign inform consent , order application aphasia diagnosis Boston test , Edinburgh test , Barthel scale , Zung anxiety depression test , EuroQol scale , Neuropsi . Subsequently subject randomizate two arm study . A week start stimulation session , follow test apply assess language production : Boston Test Verbal Fluency ( FAS ) . Each patient daily session EMT-r low-frequency active inactive coil biphasic stimulator pulse apply ten day two week triangular area - homologous injury Lower Front Gyrus ( LFG ) , ( right brain hemisphere ) . Complete treatment schedule two week , language production evaluate , also scale Barthel Rankin-m , Zung anxiety depression EuroQol . This monitoring achieve five stage : one week , one month , 4 month , 8 month 12 month post-stimulation , intention determine duration effectiveness effect language production EMT-r .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some study report low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation patient ischemic stroke generates leave modulation cortical excitability facilitating , promote functional reorganization facilitate language production . Stroke major public health problem , one-third patient survive first year vascular event , cause severe disability also third lead cause death worldwide . Two-thirds survivor neurologic deficit include aphasia ( 19 % ) generate functional disability , compromise daily living activity , impact quality life ( 93 % patient aphasia stroke compare 50 % survive without aphasia ) . Aphasia additional risk factor depression ( prevalence 5-63 % ) , also interfere functional cognitive recovery , increase risk mortality . Generally treatment aphasia base speech therapy drug therapy orient comorbidities depression anxiety . However , study different intervention effort improve speech recovery aphasia , Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) , facilitate recovery stimulate contralesional lesional region . Most study base transcallosal disinhibition theory , consist block homotopic region low frequency stimulation right posterior GFI ( triangular portion ) produce GFI disinhibition right leave facilitate neuroplasticity brain process . EMT technique base principle electromagnetic induction , propose Michael Faraday ( 1831 ) , posit magnetic field depend stimulation time , generate electric field eventually cause neuronal excitability.The strength electric current produce coil 5-10 Ka ( Kiloamperes ) , strength induce magnetic field 1 2 Tesla , cortical area stimulate 3 cmÂ² 2 cm depth . The magnetic field generate may sufficient magnitude density depolarize cortical neuron tract , directly axonal cone indirectly interneurons . When TMS pulse apply repeatedly , know repetitive TMS ( r-TMS ) produce modulation cortical excitability , increase decreasing , depend stimulation parameter . Those effect may persist beyond train stimulation ; define repetitive series regular pulse . Fundamental mechanism EMT , yet fully understood , due inter-session inter-subject variability observe modulation induce excitability . The EMT-r may also induce change hormonal neurotransmitter system , , serotonin , dopamine , NMDA receptor , taurine , aspartate , serine axis regulate expression gene ; cfo , c-jung , important synaptic plasticity . It study several possible mechanism involve functional regulation exert EMT-r , synaptic plasticity , explore one , change excitability neuronal network , activation feedback loop metaplasticity , understood plasticity synaptic plasticity . However , although yet , establish whether source clinical benefit scheme stimulation direct indirect result modulation excitability , believe associated neuromodulators release growth factor neurotrophic factor derive brain , play important role mechanism EMT .</detailed_description>
