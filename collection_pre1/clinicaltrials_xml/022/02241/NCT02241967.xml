	<brief_summary>The proper control acute chronic pain one important area health care . Despite profound advance neuroscience past 20 year , investigator still largely use opiate narcotic , much do Civil War . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one common orthopedic procedure perform 1 . While knee pain often complaint precedes TKA , procedure associate considerable post-operative pain lasting day week . Adequate postoperative pain control important factor determine recovery time hospital length stay . New analgesic strategy need use adjunctively exist strategy potential reduce reliance opioid analgesia . Several novel brain stimulation technology include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) begin demonstrate promise treatment variety pain condition . Electricity metabolite residue , deliver minimal discomfort without problem associate drug-drug interaction . In two independent preliminary pilot study , Investigators show tDCS reduce post-operative PCA use much 46 % simultaneously reduce subjective pain rating . The present study aim determine effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) post-operative pain , patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) use , post-surgical complication 48-hour post-operative period follow total knee arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Dependent Effects tDCS Post-Operative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study employ randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled design evaluate effect tDCS pain among Veterans receive unilateral total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Further , study examine dose-dependency tDCS analgesic effect . 120 patient undergoing TKA randomly assign one four group : . Group 1 4 session real tDCS , Group 2 - 2 session real tDCS ( + 2 sham-sessions ) , Group 3 - 1 session real tDCS ( + 3 sham-sessions ) . Group 4 `` Sham '' tDCS , involve real stimulation . The participant receive 2 tDCS treatment day surgery , 2 tDCS treatment day surgery .</detailed_description>
