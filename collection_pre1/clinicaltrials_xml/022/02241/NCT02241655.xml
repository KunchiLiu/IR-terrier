	<detailed_description>Delirium one several geriatric syndrome , among common postoperative complication , affect 70 % surgical patient older 60 . Delirium acute change manifest inattention inability think logically , deeply distress patient family . Based survey 1,000 surgical patient , 30 % worried experience delirium . Delirious patient unable participate effectively rehabilitation exercise susceptible geriatric syndrome , like fall . The occurrence duration delirium associate longer intensive care unit hospital stay , persistent cognitive deterioration , hospital readmission increase mortality rate . Additionally , delirium carry huge social economic burden , cost $ 60,000 per patient per year . Despite importance delirium patient society , approach proven prevent postoperative delirium . Furthermore postoperative delirium frequently unrecognized , surgical patient follow systematically discharge hospital . Without diagnose delirium follow patient postoperatively , limited ability test effectiveness intervention prevent treat postoperative delirium sequela . There mount evidence electroencephalography guidance general anesthesia decrease postoperative delirium . Specifically , group find suppress electroencephalogram pattern , occur deep anesthesia , associate increase delirium death surgery . The Electroencephalography Guidance Anesthesia Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes ( ENGAGES ) Study therefore compare effectiveness two anesthetic protocol reduction postoperative delirium . One protocol base current standard anesthetic practice , protocol base electroencephalography guidance . We also expect determine impact anesthetic protocol patient report outcomes health-related quality life . At Washington University , successfully implement ambitious study enroll patient preoperative assessment clinic , track health wellbeing 30 day 1-year postoperatively . This enable u assess consequence postoperative delirium determine whether anesthetic management impact patient report outcome , health-related quality life . We shall also explore whether multi-component safety intervention delirious patient prevents downstream adverse event , like fall . The ENGAGES study - structure anesthesia protocol , thorough approach delirium assessment , ability track patient ' health wellbeing postoperatively - poise make major contribution care elderly patient risk postoperative delirium adverse outcome .</detailed_description>
