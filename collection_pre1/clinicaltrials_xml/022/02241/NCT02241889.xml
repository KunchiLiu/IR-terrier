	<brief_summary>Blood glucose control system utilize insulin glucagon manage blood sugar pave way revolutionize management disease . The benefit improve control blood sugar level compare standard insulin pump therapy already demonstrate . However , risk low blood sugar type 1 diabetes increase considerably exercise . The investigator research group show small dos glucagon prevent low blood sugar use blood sugar control system patient type 1 diabetes . However , insulin sensitivity change occur rapidly exercise , ability recognize onset physical activity order appropriately adjust insulin glucagon delivery vital help prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia . The purpose study test well new modify blood sugar control system control blood sugar exercise compare : 1 ) current system without modification 2 ) standard insulin pump therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three-way , Cross-over Closed-loop Exercise Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects exercise three study visit . During one visit , blood sugar control use standard insulin pump therapy . The investigator blood glucose control system manage blood sugar subject visit , exercise announcement insulin glucagon delivery modification one visit . Treatment order randomize . Heart rate accelerometry data also collect visit purpose design exercise detection system future study . Each subject ask undergo eligibility screen sign consent form study procedure take place . At screen appointment , consent form sign , blood drawn laboratory test brief physical exam perform . An EKG VO2max test complete screening . Subjects enrol study come sensor insertion visit 72 hour study visit . Subjects undergo three 21-hour study OHSU clinic OHSU clinical research center . Subjects arrive research center 8pm . Approximately 2 hour low-carbohydrate breakfast Day 2 , subject exercise 45 minute 60 % VO2max determine screen . Three hour completion exercise , subject eat lunch . The study end ~5 hour lunch . Capillary blood glucose ( CBG ) measure every 2 hour day , every 3 hour night exercise study use blood glucose control system subject blind CBG value . For study use insulin pump therapy , subject sample CBG four time day well exercise . Study staff monitor study remotely use cloud server . An investigator nurse practitioner specialty endocrinology internal medicine site ( locate within complex ) time .</detailed_description>
