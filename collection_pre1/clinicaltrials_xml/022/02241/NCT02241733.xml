	<brief_summary>People moderate severe COPD trap air lung . This lessen ability exercise . The investigator develop computerized breathing retrain program help patient empty lung exercise . The investigator believe learn control breathe help patient active . The purpose study test effect use breathe retrain ( intervention group ) versus breathe retrain ( control group ) part 12-week exercise program . The investigator examine long term effect train exercise capacity ability empty one lung exercise . Patients participate 12-week exercise program , without breathe retrain . They participate 42 week adherence program maintain physical activity . Patient test competed baseline , 12 week , 6 month 1 year . 250 patient moderate severe COPD enrol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Development dynamic hyperinflation primary limit factor exercise tolerance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . To lessen development dynamic hyperinflation , improve exercise tolerance COPD patient , investigator develop breathing-retraining technique use pulmonary rehabilitation . This breathing-retraining technique design decrease respiratory rate prolong exhalation . The investigator demonstrate , short-term , hyperinflation exercise duration improve breathing-retraining plus exercise-training exercise-training alone . Because crucial aspect pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance short-term benefit long-term , investigator propose test whether short-term benefit breathing-retraining plus exercise follow adherence-intervention program sustainable long-term Primary Hypothesis : ( H1 ) In COPD patient , improvement exercise duration constant- load treadmill test great 12 week breathing-retraining plus exercise-training follow 42-week adherence-intervention program ( 1 yr. total ) 12 week exercise-training alone follow 42-week adherence-intervention program ( 1 yr. total ) . Secondary Hypotheses : One year randomization , exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation less constant-load treadmill test ( H2 ) , 6-minute walking distance longer ( H3 ) , mastery breathe great ( H4 ) breathing-retraining plus exercise-training group exercise-alone group . Lastly ( exploratory objective ) , investigator assess effect patient 's physiologic , psychologic clinical phenotype short- term long-term responsiveness pulmonary rehabilitation . Methods : The propose study randomize , control clinical trial 250 patient moderate-to-severe COPD enrol . One hundred forty patient expect qualify randomization breathing-retraining plus exercise-training group exercise-training alone group . Patients receive 12-weeks supervise train accord group assignment ( three time weekly ) follow adherence-intervention program ( weekly phone motivational interview , home-exercise program , monthly laboratory booster session ) . Follow-up testing complete 12 week , 6 12 month . Testing include pulmonary function test , incremental-load constant-load treadmill test , 6-minute walk test , measurement dyspnea , assessment respiratory quadriceps muscle strength endurance quadriceps ultrasonography . Analysis : In principal analysis primary outcome measure ( exercise duration ; H1 ) investigator compare change exercise duration ( constant work-rate treadmill test ) baseline end study use 2-sample t-test ( two-tailed =.05 ) . The primary analysis base intention-to-treat principle . Multiple imputation use study subject miss 12-month measurement . This imputation model base baseline characteristic study participant . Several secondary analysis primary outcome measure perform ( H2-H4 ) . Linear regression use determine whether observe treatment benefit persist adjustment baseline covariates measure adherence treatment . Since several measurement take patient , mixed-models analysis use compare change constant-load treadmill test time two group .</detailed_description>
