	<detailed_description>Introduction A mortality benefit implanted cardiac defibrillator patient ( pt ) severely impaired LV function establish multiple large trial . Atrial fibrillation , -flutter -tachycardia common comorbidity patient population . Cardioversion method choice reestablish normal sinus rhythm instance . Safety efficacy external electrical cardioversion ( CV ) patient pacemaker ICDs could show several small single center trial . Safety internal cardioversion describe several small trial . Reports efficacy internal CV vary 33 % 83 % . Performing external instead internal cardioversion pt implant ICDs feasible hospital , CV perform without programmer present , e.g . ICU ward , device interrogation do CV remote ICD/pacemaker clinic . A work group German cardiac society recommend internal CV patient carry ICD , suggest superior safety profile internal CV , despite conflict data lack evidence issue . Thus , pose problem logistics many hospital . No scientific data safety efficacy endpoint compare internal vs external CV currently available . Aim study To compare external v internal electrical cardioversion atrial arrhythmias establish safety efficacy profile external internal cardioversion large cohort ICD patient . This study provide vital evidence future recommendation regard cardioversion grow population patient carry implanted ICD pacemaker . The main purpose establish non-inferiority external electrical cardioversion internal electrical cardioversion . This would impact day day practice many arrhythmia center small hospital around world . Trial population choice primary analysis set The full-analysis set ( FAS ) derive intention-to-treat ( ITT ) principle . This dataset include trial subject randomize , valid data primary target variable `` occurrence severe lead device impairment '' `` restoration normal sinus rhythm '' . The per-protocol set include trial subject essentially treat accord protocol ( i.e . cardioverted assign ) primary target variable `` occurrence severe lead device impairment '' `` restoration normal sinus rhythm '' could determine base complete meaningful documentation . In non-inferiority trial special issue choice primary analysis set . Conservatism anticonversatism ITT PP analysis depend various factor type protocol deviation missingness , method handle miss data ITT population ( see Sanchez MM , Chen X . Choosing analysis population non-inferiority study : per protocol intent-to-treat . Stat Med . 25 , 1169-81 ; 2006 ) . Due setting ( randomization immediately intervention , allowance cross-over internal external CV , intervention hospital set ) expect relevant amount protocol violation . As follow-up period 2 week short , expect &lt; 1 % loss follow-up . So assume minor discrepancy ITT PP population . We expect miss data primary efficacy endpoint , measure immediately CV . The primary safety endpoint measure within two week CV , expect non-trivial missingness dropout due lack efficacy . As expect number event primary safety endpoint low , especially internal CV patient , method handle miss data ITT analysis may cause relevant bias . Thus , per-protocol set consider primary analysis population ; ITT analysis treat secondary/supportive lead similar conclusion . Patients without valid data primary target variable exclude FAS ( modify ITT ) , case miss data safety endpoint valid value use . In sensitivity analysis conservative scenario perform treat miss value event external CV group event internal CV group . Any relevant discrepancy drop-out rate CV group discuss . Outcome data data analysis In case cross-over internal external CV primary endpoint assess internal shock . Patient 's death intervention within follow-up period unlikely expect . In case patient death intervention , shock , primary efficacy endpoint treat failure . In case patient death intervention , shock follow , primary safety value count failure/severe device lead impairment . This may revise cause death proven lead device associate interrogation analysis manufacturer . Stratification study center feasible due low number expect event , subgroup analysis study center do descriptive reason . Duration study size This study multicenter trial . Additional local ethic application require center . For primary safety endpoint `` severe lead device impairment '' expect incidence 10 % external CV group 5 % internal CV group . Thus , one-sided alpha 5 % , non-inferiority margin 15 % , power 80 % , sample size 103 patient per arm , i.e . 206 total , require . To account loss follow-up ( &lt; 1 % within 2 week CV ) heterogeneity center , 230 patient ( ≈206/ ( 1-0.05 ) ^2 ) ( see Donner , A . Approaches sample size estimation design clinical trial -- review . Stat Med 3 , 199-214 ; 1984 ) randomize . A non-inferiority margin 15 % large , however , choose several endpoint act sensitive surrogate possible temporary lead affectation , rather rely solely hard endpoint permanent lead device failure necessity surgical revision . As data placebo-controlled trial exist set ICD trial determine non-inferiority margin statistical ground , margin choose clinically well practicality ground . A relevantly small alpha tight margin would lead unachievable sample size render trial unfeasible ( see D'Agostino , R. B. , Massaro , J. M. &amp; Sullivan , L. M. Non-inferiority trial : design concept issue - encounter academic consultant statistic . Stat Med 22 , 169-186 ; 2003 ) . Of note , detect absolute risk reduction 20 % primary efficacy endpoint `` restoration normal sinus rhythm '' , assume incidence 90 % external CV group 70 % internal CV group , sample size 72 patient per arm , i.e . 144 total , require ( two-sided alpha 5 % , power 80 % , continuity correct chi-squared test ) . Sample size determination perform ADDPLAN™ 6.0 . Description trial subject group At baseline ( i.e . CV ) treatment group describe compare use mean , standard deviation percentile ( 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 ) continuous variable , count percentage categorical variable . Variables summarize include among sex , age , BMI , comorbidities , type device , site implantation , LV ejection fraction , type anticoagulation , duration arrhythmia , leave atrial diameter , pace threshold , lead impedance , shock impedance , ventricular biventricular pacing percentage , battery voltage . Primary safety endpoint The primary hypothesis `` non-inferiority external CV internal CV '' regard primary safety endpoint `` severe lead device impairment '' evaluate use confidence interval ( CI ) approach . A one-sided 95 % CI difference `` observed proportion external group - observe proportion internal group '' calculate Newcombe 's method 10 non-inferiority declare show one-sided level 5 % upper bound lie non-inferiority bound 15 % . Primary efficacy endpoint If non-inferiority regard primary safety endpoint `` severe lead device impairment '' could demonstrate , hypothesis `` superiority external CV internal CV '' regard primary efficacy endpoint `` restoration normal sinus rhythm '' test confirmatory way two-sided level 5 % . Due fix sequence two hypothesis , type I error inflate . The proportion primary efficacy endpoint compare treatment group Fisher 's exact test two-sided 95 % CI calculate Newcombe 's method 10 . Secondary endpoint The component primary safety endpoint ( i.e . rise threshold ( constant duration ) &gt; 0.5V , exit block , loss programming , rise shock impedance 50 % , rise charge time 50 % , drop battery voltage ≥0.2V within 2 week ) analyze along line composite . Moreover , recurrence atrial arrhythmia FU , lead impedance sensing change , inadvertent induction VF CV , high-sensitive Troponin T level 3h CV summarize treatment group compare statistical hypothesis test applicable ; confidence interval treatment differences/effect size calculate aid interpretation . Subgroup analysis A subanalysis predefined subgroup perform : - CRT-D patient assess safety external CV pt LV lead . - CRT-D patient quadripolar lead ( include threshold 16 pace vector ) - CRT-D patient AV-VV optimization algorithm Safety suspension/termination criterion Based publish data previous work 10 interim safety analysis perform 50 % target sample size , i.e . 115 pt , include . A statistically significant difference primary safety endpoint group interim analysis lead subsequent early termination trial ( use Fisher 's exact test , two-sided level 5 % ) . Specific termination criterion : - Significant difference primary safety endpoint interim analysis - Induction VF internal CV group n &gt; 3</detailed_description>
