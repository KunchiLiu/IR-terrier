	<brief_title>MSCs Combined With CD25 Monoclonal Antibody Calcineurin Inhibitors Treatment Steroid-resistant aGVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) effective therapy several hematological disorder . Although good progress make prevention treatment side effect associate transplantation , aGVHDremains common life-threatening complication poor prognosis . Corticosteroids still act first-line treatment aGVHD , response rate 50-80 . However , fail initial therapy 10-30 % long-term survival . Mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate many tissue , bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue umbilical cord . Such cell possess capacity suppress immunological response , support hematopoiesis repair tissue . Clinical application human MSCs evolve rapidly prevent treat GVHD . Although result still controversy , prospective retrospective data suggest MSCs effective aGVHD . In present study , investigator prospectively evaluate efficacy safety ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor combine CD25 monoclonal antibody calcineurin inhibitor treat patient aGVHD .</detailed_description>
