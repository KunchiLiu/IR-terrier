	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To examine effect Self-Directed Biological Transformation Initiative ( SBTI ) course participant compare control group participant key biochemical physiological marker . 2 . To examine effect SBTI course participant compare control group participants short- long-term change heart rate variability , level activity , sleep quality . 3 . To examine effect SBTI course participant compare control group participant mood wellbeing . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE It long think ancient practice promote longevity wellbeing little empirical evidence difficult test control experimental condition . Recently , however , several cellular-based marker may index rate biological aging . The rate telomere shorten , indexed change telomere length telomerase activity , predict cellular human longevity ( Lin et al , 2012 ) . It relate malleable factor , lifestyle psychological state ( Puterman &amp; Epel , 2012 ) . A secondary measure show promise understand rate cellular age examination gene expression , particularly gene relate age . Preliminary evidence suggest mind-body practice may slow rate cellular age improve telomere/telomerase maintenance system . This examine four small study far . In first study kind , four month intensive lifestyle modification program , include yoga group support associate increase telomerase 39 men prostate cancer ( preparation ) . There control group study . However , great decrease distress thought cancer show big increase telomerase activity ( Ornish et al , 2008 ) . In second study , healthy men woman randomize 3-month intensive in-residence meditation group wait list control group . The researcher examine telomerase post intervention find meditation group 30 % high telomerase , increase wellbeing associate increase telomerase ( Jacobs et al , 2011 ) . In another study active control group , examine 39 elderly high stress dementia caregiver . They randomize half group Yoga Nidra , listen 15 minute tape day Yoga Nidra , include instruction breathe hand movement half control group listen relaxation tape 15 minute day . Eight week later , find great telomerase increase Yoga Nidra group , across sample , decrease depressive symptom associate increase telomerase activity ( Lavretsky et al , 2013 ) . Similar study report positive effect practice inflammatory profile gene expression ( Tang , Ma et al . 2009 , Bhasin , Dusek et al . 2013 , Saatcioglu 2013 ) . Another well study parameter practice meditation yoga heart rate variability ( HRV ) provide broad measure autonomic nervous system activity . Observational study report HRV associate stress workplace , ( Jarczok , Jarczok et al . 2013 ) depressive anxiety disorder ( Gorman Sloan 2000 ) , individual chronic somatic complaint ( Tak , Riese et al . 2009 ) . Meditation yoga intervention improve HRV lead improve physiologic clinical outcome ( Wheat Larkin 2010 , Papp , Lindfors et al . 2013 ) . Other parameter also potential benefit evaluate individual 's overall wellbeing . For example , sleep duration quality , well general activity level contribute reflect overall wellbeing . To date , however , lack compel data around objective measure wellbeing large part due challenge associate long term monitoring monitor appropriate patient population . However , recent advance biosensor technology overcome limitation allow non-obtrusive passive monitoring individual long period time . These new data stream real-time physiologic data , couple sophisticated individualized data analytics potentially identify novel measure individual wellness , allow development personalize therapeutic intervention improve wellbeing . Overall , result many study traditional practice compelling , reality , accord whole system approach Ayurveda Chines Medicine , traditional practice rarely practice singularly , i.e , typically yoga asana practice meditation well form pranayama ( breathe ) . With consideration , scientific study take comprehensive `` whole system '' approach simultaneously inclusive numerous practice . Regarding outcome , study take system biology approach examine biochemical , physiological , psychosocial effect intervention . It anticipate finding demonstrate value take inclusive comprehensive whole system approach improve wellbeing improved health .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Men woman age 4080 year 2 . Selfreported diagnosis major medical condition , cancer ( include receive past radiation chemotherapy treatment ) , heart disease , autoimmune disease , diabetes , affect cell age system possibly ability telomerase change short period 3 . Individuals take antidepressant medication exclude since medication appear increase telomerase ( Wolkowitz et al , 2010 ) 4 . Individuals diagnose PTSD exclude ; evidence PTSD may lower telomere length compare without PTSD ( O'Donovan et al , 2011 ) . It currently unknown PTSD may impact telomerase level 5 . Estrogen use exclude increase telomerase ( Lin et al , 2011 ) 6 . Smokers exclude since smoking decrease telomerase . We base smoke status self report . If participant smoke regularly past 6 month , consider 'nonsmoker 7 . Pregnant woman exclude since cell age system change pregnancy way study 8 . Participants Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 35 great exclude due difference telomerase activity obese woman 9 . Potential eligible participant unable secure week work responsibility enrol 10 . Known atrial fibrillation chronic dysrhythmia</criteria>
