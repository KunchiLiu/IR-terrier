	<brief_summary>Healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) associate substantial morbidity , mortality health-care cost child undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . These infection often cause patient 's microbial flora . Hence reduction microbe skin could lessen risk contamination central venous catheter , Central Line Associated Blood-Stream Infections ( CLABSI ) , bacteremia due compromise skin integrity . Theraworx™ ( herein refer experimental wipe ) self-drying , leave cleanse agent combine specialize surfactant skin healthy ingredient , include aloe , allantoin , vitamin E , silver , main antimicrobial ingredient . It use part body include burn , abrade skin , patient skin graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) . It user friendly obviates risk antimicrobial resistance . Microbiologic study show several log fold reduction bacteria include vancomycin-resistant enterococci , carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli , activity Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus faecalis , Clostridium difficile , Candida albicans , virus include influenza A Herpes Simplex . There data regard use Theraworx™ ( experimental ) bath wipe child HSCT population . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital want learn daily bath experimental bath wipe well tolerate associate reduction microbial skin colonization population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Theraworx Bath Wipes Versus Standard Bath Wipes Reduction Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize receive either daily bath experimental bath wipe , standard bath wipe , begin day admission , use daily period 60 day post-HSCT . In first 12 patient randomized experimental wipe , patient grade IV skin toxicity attributable experimental wipe , trial continue total 250 evaluable participant enrol . Assessment skin colonization perform admission , time discharge , post-HSCT . Randomization take place time participant enrol performed staff within Nursing Research Department . Participants assign either experimental standard bath wipe 1:1 ratio . Randomization may stratify nature transplant ( autologous vs. allogeneic ) ; case allogeneic transplant stratify total body irradiation vs. total body irradiation . The investigator , practice clinician clinical research staff remain blinded treatment . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - Assess safety experimental bath wipe 12 patient . - Assess skin colonization vancomycin-resistant enterococci patient use experimental wipe compare standard bath wipe . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Assess skin colonization bacterial pathogen . - Compare skin colonization multi-drug resistant organism ( MRDO ) central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) rate .</detailed_description>
