The design propose study prospective randomize double-blind trial compare IV Ibuprofen placebo control ( normal saline ) time procedure patient undergo ERCP Children 's Medical Center Dallas two-year period . The primary outcome measurement development PEP . Post-ERCP bleed change pre- post- procedural pain score also measure . The hypothesis IV Ibuprofen administer time ERCP decrease rate post-ERCP pancreatitis pediatric patient .</brief_summary>
