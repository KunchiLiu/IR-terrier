	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn use new image solution , 3'-Deoxy-3'-18f-Fluorothymidine , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan help doctor determine brain lesion tumor return effect previous treatment . The result image scan ( call FLT PET scan ) compare result Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan , already schedule outside study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FLT PET Scan : If find eligible take part study , FLT PET scan . An FLT PET scan us 3'-Deoxy-3'-18f-Fluorothymidine solution , contain small amount radioactive material . The radioactive nature solution allow scanner `` see '' certain place body . You receive solution vein catheter . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . After injection , need rest quietly time scan . The amount rest time may vary , prepared wait 60 minute . During scan , lie flat back table . After solution inject vein , PET scanner take picture radioactive solution move body collect various site body . By watch solution travel body study solution collect , researcher may able learn disease body . The entire procedure last 60-70 minute . You must eat drink anything except water least 6 hour FLT PET scan . About 2 minute FLT solution inject , blood ( 10 teaspoon ) draw catheter . This blood drawn measure much FLT body may help study staff understand image well . Length Study : After FLT PET scan complete , active participation study . Follow-Up Medical Record Review : About 30 day FLT PET scan , contact phone study staff check side effect . The phone call last 15 minute . Your medical record continue review additional 5 year learn , treatment may work , new brain problem , tumor come back . This investigational study . The 3'-Deoxy-3'-18f-Fluorothymidine solution FDA approve commercially available . At time , 3'-Deoxy-3'-18f-Fluorothymidine solution use research . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient &gt; /= 18 year old , agree participate clinical study complete require visit evaluation . The pediatric population different disease profile glioma patient hope recruit . To reduce heterogeneity patient population consider patient young 18 study . 2 . Patient candidate cerebral tumor resection due enhance brain lesion , history previous pathologically proven primary brain tumor ( WHO grade IIIV diffuse glioma ) 3 . Patient diffuse glioma ( WHO grade 2 4 ) part treatment receive radiation therapy Temozolomide ( firstline chemotherapeutic agent ) . 4 . Patient subsequently develop enhance brain mass great 1cm diameter , least 6 month finish radiation therapy ( differentiate acute treatment related effect `` pseudoprogression '' ) . 5 . As predominate mean determine TRN versus recurrent glial tumor MD Anderson , brain tumor/ necrosis protocol order clinically indicate . 6 . Patient 's clinician base clinical MR information want proceed biopsy surgical resection within 30 day brain tumor MR protocol perform . The patient meet neurosurgeon agree surgical biopsy resection . 7 . Patient able understand give consent participation study 8 . Patient receive part care Brain Tumor Imaging protocol . 9 . Patient agree undergo , prior procedure , FLT PET CABI 1 . The patient find unfavorable anatomy indicate stereotactic biopsy/ resection could safely perform 2 . Claustrophobia readily respond oral medication 3 . Allergy FluoroLThymidine 4 . Pregnant lactating ( Based selfreported clinical care test physician study participation )</criteria>
