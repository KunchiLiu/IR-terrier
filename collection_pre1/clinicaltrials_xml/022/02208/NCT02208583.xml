	<detailed_description>This multi-center study explore molecular phenotypic change castration-resistant prostate cancer histopathological , immunohistochemical molecular analysis cancer relate gene castration-resistant prostate cancer.After patient eligibility determine , tumor tissue acquire archival transurethral resection re-biopsy specimens patient recurrence , visceral metastasis , bone metastasis . According molecular phenotypic change , personalize treatment perform . Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor image study . The tumor specimens diagnosis prostate cancer need participant . After assess prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level tumor molecular phenotypic feature , participant separate different treatment group : 1 . Participants `` AR dependent '' CRPC ( generally high PSA level and/or high AR expression ) druggable gene mutation receive Docetaxel/prednisone+Target drug . 2 . Participants `` AR dependent '' CRPC ( generally high PSA level and/or high AR expression ) without druggable gene mutation receive Docetaxel/ Prednisone . 3 . Participants `` AR independent '' CRPC ( generally without AR expression and/or rapid progression low PSA level ) druggable gene mutation receive Cisplatin/Etoposide+Target drug . 4 . Participants `` AR independent '' CRPC ( generally without AR expression and/or rapid progression low PSA level ) without druggable gene mutation receive Cisplatin/Etoposide . Participants druggable gene mutation receive correspond molecular target drug . Participants epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene mutation receive drug call Gefitinib , inhibit protein call EGFR think key factor development progression cancer . Participants B-type Raf kinase ( BRAF ) gene mutation receive drug call Vemurafenib , inhibit protein call mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) think key factor development progression cancer . Participants v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 ( AKT1 ) gene mutation receive drug call Celecoxib , inhibit protein call v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue ( AKT ) think key factor development progression cancer . Participants erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 ( ERBB2 ) gene mutation receive drug call lapatinib , inhibit protein think key factor development progression cancer . Participants PDGFRA gene mutation receive drug call sunitinib , inhibit protein think key factor development progression cancer . Participants PIK3CA gene mutation receive drug call Everolimus , inhibit protein call AKT think key factor development progression cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 18 Years old ; 2. patient CRPC accord European Association Urology diagnostic criterion ; 3. vital organ function include bone marrow , heart , liver , kidney normal ; 4. complete pathological specimen include newly diagnose prostate cancer disease progress CRPC : ① biopsy surgical specimen ( tissue bank wax block preserve specimen ) diagnosis ; ② rebiopsy specimen , transurethral prostatectomy ( TURP ) specimens , metastasis palliative surgical specimen ( tissue bank wax block preserve specimen ) progress CRPC ; ③ amount sufficient sample DNA extraction quality control standard ( ) Sample type : None RNA degradation pollutionfree DNA sample ; ( b ) amount sample ( single ) : ≥ 250ng ( use agilent liquid platform ) ; ( c ) sample concentration : ≥ 50 ng / μl ( use agilent liquid platform ) ; ( ) sample purity : OD 260/280 = 1.8 ~ 2.0 ) ; 5 . Then perform follow test patient meet criterion : ①Histological analysis : Hematoxylineosin ( HE ) stain ②immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) stain ③ 48 carcinoma associate exon sequence 6 . After perform test , enter treatment group ① Docetaxel &amp; Prednisone ( DP ) : high PSA gene mutation ; ② DP + target drug : high PSA gene mutation ; ③ cisplatin &amp; Etoposide ( EP ) : low PSA gene mutation ; ④ EP + target drug : Low PSA gene mutation . 7 . All patient enrol draw peripheral blood sample 7.5ml detect circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , monitor efficacy . 8 . Willing able comply program study period . 9 enter clinical trial provide write informed consent form , patient know withdraw study time study , without loss . 10 .
