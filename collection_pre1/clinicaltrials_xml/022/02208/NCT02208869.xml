	<brief_summary>True prevalence FH Russian Federation unknown lead low percentage diagnose treated case . Research need determine prevalence FH , specific diagnostic algorithm optimal treatment strategy . The main aim present study evaluate extent FH underdiagnosed undertreated Russian Federation reduction cardiovascular risk relate atherosclerosis country . As first step , total cholesterol ( TC ) low-density lipoprotein ( LDL-C ) level determine random sample Moscow population ( n=18000 ) . It expect TC ≥ 7.5 mmol/L detect 10 % cohort . During 2014 , approximately 500 patient pass non-invasive clinical examination Russian Cardiology Research Production Center , include patient demographic , past medical history , family history hypercholesterolemia , physical finding , current lipid-lowering therapy , blood test , genetic analysis , echocardiography , carotid duplex ultrasound exercise SPECT imaging select case . On basis Moscow Program four major Federal Medical Centers involve , FH Registry create national , multi-center initiative screen FH patient , control diagnosis management , track clinical-reported outcome time . Establishment National Guidelines diagnosis treatment FH basis data implementation clinical practice different region Russia allow improve patient care . As expect outcome , program raise awareness increase appropriate assessment treatment FH patient Russia , lead timely detection disease therapy initiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>*Design . We choose randomly select cohort individual test Moscow office `` INVITRO '' Laboratory basis advertising campaign hold September , 2013 , purpose TC level measurement determination cardiovascular risk use SCORE chart . The operator `` INVITRO '' Laboratory identify potential FH patient base TC ( ≥7.5 mmol/L ) LDL-C ( ≥4.9 mmol/L ) value . Following identification , potentially eligible participant suspect FH send notification letter describe patient 's high cholesterol level , at-atherosclerosis risk status need additional screening basis Russian Cardiology Research Production Center . Those give preliminary agreement participation Program invite Institution , , sign ICF , undergo clinical ( biochemical , echo , duplex scan ) genetic testing . Those individual refuse participate Program take account fix reason unwillingness participate . Patients age 18 enrol explicit consent parent legal guardian . All participant provide information Russian FH Community Russian FH Registry . All include subject provide screen questionnaire query patient demographic , past medical history , patient FH history diagnosis FH type heterozygous homozygous , family history hypercholesterolemia , physical examination finding , current lipid-lowering therapy , patient ' contact information follow-up . After initialization online data capture form ( Electronic Medical System ) , information also enter system . Blood gene bank form ; analysis echocardiography data aortic valve stenosis , carotid duplex ultrasound atherosclerosis burden , exercise SPECT imaging select case suspect coronary heart disease ( CHD ) perform baseline visit . Patients diagnose FH basis Dutch Lipid Clinic Network , Simon Broome Criteria genetic testing provide information screen first-degree relative , additional educational material FH ( development ) . To determine true number heterozygous form among individual probable diagnosis FH molecular genetic testing plan . When causative mutation find index case , genetic test offer first-degree relative . Enrolled patient ask update information annually interval . Since last date data entry , occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event ( acute coronary syndrome , stroke , myocardial revascularization , peripheral revascularization , cardiovascular death ) , change medication , hospitalization reason , genetic testing , laboratory value , all-cause mortality review . Follow-up data collect yearly follow initial enrollment . Updated information quality life collect . Annual reminder email send patient call follow physician . We estimate one site one year ( 2014-2015 ) screen 500 patient eligible participation potentially eligible 1505 select 18000 individual . - Five leading Federal Medical Centers different region Russia involve first two step Program : 1 . Federal State Institution `` Russian Cardiology Research Production Center '' Health Ministry Russian Federation ( Moscow ) ; First line Federal Medical Centers 2 . Samara State Medical University ( Samara ) ; 3 . Research Institute Internal Medicine ( Novosibirsk ) ; 4 . Saint-Petersburg State University ( Sokolov Center atherosclerosis lipid disorder Clinical Hospital №122 ( Saint Petersburg ) ) ; 5 . Chelyabinsk State Medical Academy ( Chelyabinsk ) - A total three schedule visit plan course study . Visit 1 occur Screening Period ( Part A ) . Patients enter Screening Period ( Part A ) signing ICF , instruct follow regional dietary guideline duration study . They undergo clinical ( biochemical , ultra-sound , duplex scan ) exercise SPECT imaging applicable . Those individual refuse participate study take account fix reason unwillingness participate . All include subject provide screen questionnaire query patient demographic , past medical history , patient FH history diagnosis FH type heterozygous homozygous , family history hypercholesterolemia , physical examination finding , current lipid-lowering therapy , patient ' contact information follow-up . After initialization online data capture form ( Electronic Medical System ) , information also enter system . For patient FH diagnose basis Dutch Lipid Clinic Network and/or Simon Broome Criteria genetic test Visit 2 occur one month period . Visit 3 occur RussianCRPC one year±10 day period . At scheduled visit update medical information , include monitor adverse cardiovascular event occurrence , change medication , blood sampling , perform . - Examination procedure schedule visit : 1 . Signing informed consent form ( ICF ) 2 . Filling questionnaire determine classical cardiovascular risk factor , past medical history treatment 3 . Applying Dutch Lipid Clinic Network ( DLCN ) Simon Broome Register ( SBR ) criteria 4 . Maintaining Electronic Medical System physicians participate Program 5 . Blood sample TC , triglyceride ( TG ) , LDL-C , HDL-C , Lp ( ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , PCSK9 measurement 6 . Genetic testing ( mutation LDLR , apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) , PCSK9 gene ) 7 . Echocardiography assessment ascend aorta aortic valve 8 . Duplex scan carotid artery assessment intima-media thickness plaque ' characteristic 9 . Exercise SPECT imaging patient suspicious coronary disease 10 . Annual evaluation cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death , non-cardiovascular death , hospitalization due acute coronary syndrome , heart failure , arterial revascularization procedure ( percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass grafting , endovascular surgical revascularization carotid artery low extremity ) , aortic valve replacement . - FH patient 1-st line Sites meet inclusion criterion describe Methods section eligible enroll . The algorithm describe initiated . Specialized staff Russian Cardiology Research Production Complex ( Core Center ) monitor effectiveness credibility undertaken work . Filling Electronic Medical System ( eCRF ) check staff Core Center , year teleconference hold Sites-Participants Program . - Perspectives : since 2018 ¬ next phase Program include recruitment new set Clinics , Policlinics Institutions across Russia specialize lipid clinic could demonstrate acceptable feasibility patient enrollment engagement .</detailed_description>
