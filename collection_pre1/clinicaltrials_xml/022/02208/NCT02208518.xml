	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasonography consider accurate method diagnosis stag chronic inflammatory neoplastic pancreatic disease . Differential diagnosis solid pancreatic mass , however , remain challenge endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration necessary . Recently , Endoscopic ultrasound elastography introduce alternative method evaluate tissue stiffness solid pancreatic mass , index tissue elasticity , may relate histopathology feature ( hard tissue = blue = neoplastic soft tissue = red-yellow-green = non-neoplastic ) . However , recently publications show different result use elastography . Moreover , lack data Endoscopic ultrasound-elastography exist regard compression rate probe diameter region interest analysis previously study physic could affect tissue elasticity . Based hypothesis elastography could affect compression rate probe diameter region interest analyze present study aim evaluate quantitative ( strain ratio ) qualitative endoscopic ultrasound-elastography result determine compression rate probe ( measure curve compression second generation elastography ) diameter region interest normal pancreatic tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>prospective study perform patient undergo upper-endoscopic ultrasound October 31-to end November 2013 . Endoscopic ultrasound-elastography perform use linear Pentax-EUS `` Hitachi-Avius '' . The quantitative-strain ratio qualitative endoscopic ultrasound-elastography measure body pancreas take consideration curve compression rate probe high : +0.4 , middle : 0 , low : -0.4 large small region interest diameter . Analysis qualitative elastography obtain predominant color pancreatic area study . Pictures record quantitative strain ratio data calculate compare endoscopic ultrasound-elastography pancreatic tissue soft tissue ( normal mucosal layer : red ) . Finally , comparative analysis perform result mean normal value quantitative strain ratio previously publish normal pancreatic tissue , different compression rate probe .</detailed_description>
