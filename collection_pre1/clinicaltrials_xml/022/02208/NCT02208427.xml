Current method diagnosis LTBI tuberculin skin test ( TST ) interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) . For preventive therapy , recommend regimen include daily isoniazid 9 month daily rifampicin 4 month . By incorporate long-acting rifapentine , new regimen combine weekly rifapentine high-dose isoniazid total 12 dos proven equal potency toxicity . However , treatment completion rate much high weekly treatment 3 month daily treatment 9 month . It reasonable use rifapentine-based preventive therapy markedly increase completion rate . However , study lacking , especially Asia , high endemic area TB . With effort health care worker public health personnel , incidence TB Taiwan gradually decline recent 10 year . In order maintain trend decrease incidence , preventive therapy LTBI become important . However , best preventive regimen LTBI still unknown . Therefore , conduct prospective randomize multicenter study compare treatment completion rate two regimen Taiwan . The first regimen daily isoniazid 9 month .

	<detailed_description>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain important infectious disease world . Keys successful control TB rapid diagnosis , prompt treatment , well effective preventive therapy contact latent TB infection ( LTBI ) . Current method diagnosis LTBI tuberculin skin test ( TST ) interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) .

However , study lacking , especially Asia , high endemic area TB . With effort health care worker public health personnel , incidence TB Taiwan gradually decline recent 10 year . In order maintain trend decrease incidence , preventive therapy LTBI become important . However , best preventive regimen LTBI still unknown . Therefore , conduct prospective randomize multicenter study compare treatment completion rate two regimen Taiwan . The first regimen daily isoniazid 9 month . The second weekly rifapentine plus high-dose isoniazid 3 month . Specific Aims : 1 . Understanding two preventive regimen high completion rate supervision . 2 . Understanding reason interruption preventive therapy . 3 . Comparing side effect profile two preventive regimen Taiwan . Methods : In prospective multicenter study , enroll close contact age &gt; =12 positive TST . Chest radiography sputum study , necessary , performed exclude active pulmonary TB . After perform baseline IGRA , participant randomize 2 group different preventive regimen . The first regimen daily isoniazid 9 month . The second weekly rifapentine plus high-dose isoniazid 3 month . The primary outcome treatment completion rate two preventive regimen . The secondary outcome toxicity . All participant follow 2 year screen development active pulmonary TB chest radiography sputum study necessary . The reason treatment incompletion record .</detailed_description>
