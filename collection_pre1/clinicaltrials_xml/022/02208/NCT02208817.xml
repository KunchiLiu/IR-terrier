	<brief_summary>2 recent national report 'Why Children Die ' 'Are yet ? 'identified deficiency recognise manage sick child . Key recommendation review include development adoption 'track trigger ' paediatric early warning score ( PEWS ) good identify sick deteriorate child . PEWS tool offer potential identify respond sooner clinical deterioration . Capillary refill time ( CRT ) measure skin blood flow vital part many early warning resuscitation score . It sensitive marker infection dehydration child . However , due perform interpreted CRT prone mark variability observer . We Medical Research Council ( MRC ) funding develop automate capillary refill device user interface provide paediatric continuous early warning ( PaedCEW ) monitoring system . The PaedCEW system would complement support current clinical practice aim address difficulty recognise ill child . We aim recruit 20 ill child Paediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) 2 match control without significant illness Nottingham Children 's Hospital . The 20 ill child CRT ( PaedCEW score ) monitor , admission PICU . This allow correlation invasive ( BP , central venous oxygen saturation , lactate ) noninvasive ( CRT , heart rate , cardiac output ) measure cardiovascular status period stability compromise . Matched control monitor around 24 hour . This pilot study allow development system . This proof concept study . This study aim demonstrate novel device measure CRT . Its correlation noninvasive measure cardiovascular status enable pragmatic comparison current clinical practice . In addition , correlation invasive measure cardiovascular status enable u calculate sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value ( NPV ) positive predictive value ( PPV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Paediatric Refill Study ( PRefill )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following recruitment , patient two device place skin , one limb ( e.g . forearm ) , one chest . They fix skin use medical adhesive tape . The device leave around 1 hour `` well patient '' general paediatric ward . At end time member research team remove device . For patient go paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) device use gather CRT data admission ( possible ) , follow discharge PICU . The PICU participant device leave stay , agreement clinical team care patient , device resited every 4-6 hour normal practice medical device attach skin . Data collect way PICU stay ( typically 2-3 day ) patient transfer general ward . Before go home , participant monitor hour CRT device obtain data well . Collecting data way allow u show CRT device detect 30 % difference perfusion well unwell patient . By compare well patient unwell patient , compare unwell patient , well . For participant collect routine demographic detail , medical history detail , Fitzpatrick skin colour assessment ( skin tone accord recognise scale ) , height , weight vital sign . Where take , collect clinically relevant data relation treatment receive result clinical investigation correlation device data . Patients PICU noninvasive measure perfusion perform clinical team . The research team also perform agree time suitable care patient . This include capillary refill ultrasound assessment blood flow ( cardiac output ) . We also conduct semistructured interview patient and/or parents/carer time study gain feedback device . This take 15 minute take form semistructured interview . We also seek user ( i.e . healthcare professional ) feedback device accompany GUI use semistructured interview ( approximately 15 minute ) .</detailed_description>
