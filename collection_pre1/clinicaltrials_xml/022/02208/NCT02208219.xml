	<brief_summary>Motor deficit common stroke , one major cause disability population . Because impact motor impairment life patient associated financial cost , health care priority develop effective efficient treatment restore motor deficit . Music-supported therapy ( MST ) recently develop enhance use affect extremity stroke . In present project , new multidisciplinary approach ( neurology , neuropsychology , music cognitive neuroscience ) undertaken order investigate effectiveness MST neurorehabilitation technique restore motor function stroke patient . In addition , complex pattern reorganization sensorimotor system study order provide information physiological mechanism underlie neurorehabilitation process . A randomized control trial propose compare first time effectiveness MST ( hospital home ) compare conventional treatment subacute stroke patient suffer motor deficit . Our hypothesis patient experience large improvement functional use affect arm due implementation MST program compare conventional treatment . We also expect observe improvement cognitive function , mood quality life . Besides , hypothesize amelioration motor cognitive domain accompany neuroplastic change sensorimotor cortex corticospinal tract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , stroke one major 's cause acquire disability developed country . Strokes cerebrovascular disorder blood supply brain disturb either ischemic hemorrhagic event cerebral artery . Motor deficit , term loss strength dexterity , present majority patient . Such deficit limit accomplishment daily activity ( disability ) affect participation patient community ( handicap ) , impact different role various social , familiar work context . Consequently , quality life patient diminish well emotional valence mood , could evolve psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , depression apathy ) . In addition economic cost medical treatment stroke occur , ability patient work age contribute society development remunerable occupation clearly disrupt . Thus , large cost maintenance patient recover motor function successfully . In regard , stroke important health care priority due direct ( medical ) indirect ( i.e . unemployment loss autonomy ) cost . Relevant finding medical acute management stroke ( i.e . minimization complication , treatment optimization , thrombosis standardize stroke unit hospital ) make . However , still little scientific evidence field neurorehabilitation clearly support application certain therapy use several centre . Thus , extremely important investigate motor rehabilitation therapy provide evidence clinician effectiveness . One approach validate therapy could promote brain plasticity , ability whereby brain change structure , function connection . Brain plasticity occur spontaneously lesion , also find learn . Many consistent study demonstrate brain plasticity cortical subcortical level due motor skill learn healthy subject . Thus , intervention imply acquisition new motor skill could good approach promote recovery motor function stroke patient . An example motor skill involve fine hand movement musical instrument playing , activity unique request complex demand central nervous system . Interactions auditory motor system establish music performance sound instrument process postulate used readjust movement . Furthermore , musical training prove lead structural functional change motor-related area . Recently , Schneider colleague develop new neurorehabilitation tool restore motor deficit stroke : Music-supported Therapy ( MST ) . In therapy , patient train play MIDI-piano electronic drum train fine gross movement , respectively . Studies acute chronic stage demonstrate patient improve motor function due therapy change accompany brain plasticity . However , , clear evidence exist advantage therapy ( MST ) compare conventional therapy provide hospital subacute patient . Besides , previous study directly compare change observe brain acute stroke patient use functional structural neuroimaging MT compare conventional standard therapy . We propose multicentre randomize control trial test benefit MST compare conventional treatment subacute stroke patient motor deficit . In study , 3 group treatment establish ( MST training hospital , MST training home Conventional Treatment ) . Participants group evaluate treatment ass motor cognitive function , emotional status , quality life brain plasticity associate treatment assess neuroimaging technique . A follow-up evaluation also perform assess improvement maintain within time . The underlying hypothesis music therapy , require learn play instrument , indirectly boost neuroplasticity affect sensorimotor cortex stroke patient due recruitment audio-motor premotor circuit brain , necessary play instrument integrate auditory motor aspect music playing .</detailed_description>
