	<brief_summary>The aim randomize single center study explore optimal dose GnRHa use trigger final oocyte maturation IVF . The study group consist oocyte donor GnRHa trigger standard trigger concept . Hypothesis : In Asian oocyte donor population , use 0.2 mg , 0.3mg 0.4 mg GnRHa lead retrieval comparable number mature oocyte ( MII ) good quality embryo . Moreover , reproductive outcome recipient similar regardless dose GnRHa use trigger .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GnRHa Trigger Asian Oocyte Donors- Dose Finding Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods A randomize control single center study . All oocyte donor , fulfil inclusion criterion , eligible inclusion randomization . Stimulation , monitoring , oocyte pick-up donor embryo transfer recipient On day two cycle , - i.e . prior commence stimulation long act FSH ( Elonva ) - donor randomize one three group , use different dos GnRHa ( Triptorelin ) trigger . Stimulation perform accord standard stimulation protocol clinic , use Elonva follow co-treatment GnRH antagonist day 5 stimulation . The dose Elonva use stimulation either 100 150 µg accord weight patient . The first transvaginal ultrasound scan ( TVUS ) perform seven eight day Elonva depot injection . As soon two follicle reach size ≥ 17mm , trigger final oocyte maturation perform one single bolus Triptorelin , 0.2 mg , 0.3mg 0.4 mg . The timing trigger 6 AM group oocyte pick-up ( OPU ) perform 34 hour , accord usual practice clinic . Importantly , patient ask check presence LH surge via urine LH detection kit 4 hour trigger bolus administer . Embryo transfer perform day two recipient . Study group I Stimulation accord abovementioned ovulation trigger 0.2mg Triptorelin . All procedure perform accord practice clinic . Study group II Stimulation accord abovementioned ovulation trigger 0.3mg Triptorelin . All procedure perform accord practice clinic . Study group III Stimulation accord abovementioned ovulation trigger 0.4mg Triptorelin . All procedure perform accord practice clinic . Randomization Randomization perform use seal envelope develop via computer generate list block twelve . The randomization perform day two cycle . Doctors blind randomization , patient nurse . Follicular fluid ( FF ) collection FF first puncture follicle side collect cryo-preserved -20 degree subsequent analysis steroid . Granulosa cell gene-expression analysis Cumulus mural granulosa cell preserve snap-frozen sub-group 10 patient group . The primary subsequent analysis focus possible difference LHR gene expression accord GnRHa trigger dose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Oocyte donor meet follow criterion : Age 18 35 BMI &lt; 28kg/m2 Normal ovarian reserve , define AMH &gt; 1.25 ng/ml AFC ≥ 6 measure within two month prior stimulation start Receiving GnRHantagonist protocol ovarian stimulation , Agreement participate study , disclose medical event investigator . The subject must willing able comply protocol requirement duration study . Have give write informed consent understand subject may withdraw consent time without prejudice future medical care . Previous poor response ( ≤ 3 oocyte ) high dose FSH stimulation Chronical medical condition like Diabetes , Crohns disease , Thyroid disease , Hepatitis B Sexually Transmitted Diseases Simultaneous participation interventional clinical trial . Concommitant use either LH hMG/uFSH preparation study cycle</criteria>
