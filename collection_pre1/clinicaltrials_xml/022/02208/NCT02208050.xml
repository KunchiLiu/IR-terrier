	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION Patients secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) primary progressive MS ( PPMS ) significant walk disability impair upper limb function due repeat demyelination axonal injury affect corticospinal pathway . In patient motor deficit may predominantly due demyelination result motor conduction slow and/or block potentially reversible block potassium channel demyelinate axon . Fampyra® ( fampridine-PR ) prolonged-release formulation active drug substance 4-aminopyridine { 4-AP ; fampridine [ International Nonproprietary Name ( INN ) ] . Fampridine able block certain voltage-gated K+ channel neuron , particularly demyelinated nerve . Blockade repolarising K+ current increase synaptic transmission throughout nervous system increase duration presynaptic action potential . Demyelinated nerve lose ability effectively conduct action potential fampridine help reverse . This effect demonstrate clinically proportion multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient show significant improvement motor function , specifically walk ability , Fampyra treatment . Fampridine-PR 10 mg every 12 hour twice daily ( BID ) approve Europe ( 20 July 2011 ) indication brand name Fampyra® . RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Treatment fampridine ( 4-aminopyridine ) , potassium channel blocker,1,2 show cause significant improvement walk speed one third MS patient motor disability.3-5 In patient respond , approximately 25 % improvement walk speed obtain self-reported 7 point improvement Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale ( MSWS-12 ) , patient-rated measure walk quality ability , 6,7 comparison non-responding patient placebo control subject . Pharmacologically , K+ channel block property fampridine effect action potential conduction demyelinate nerve fiber preparation extensively characterize . At low concentration relevant clinical experience ( range 0.2 2 μM [ 18 180 ng/mL ] ) , fampridine able block certain voltage-dependent K+ channel neuron . It characteristic appear explain ability drug restore conduction action potential critically demyelinate nerve fiber . At high ( millimolar ) concentration , fampridine affect type K+ channel neural non-neural tissue . Blockade repolarising K+ current may increase synaptic transmission throughout nervous system increase duration presynaptic action potential . A range neurological effect consistent increase excitability nerve cell occur clinically relevant dos fampridine . Toxicology study perform fampridine include acute repeated-dose toxicology study , reproductive toxicity study , genotoxicity study , carcinogenicity study . Clinical sign evident large , single , oral dos repeat , low , oral dos ( continuous intrathecal infusion dog ) similar specie study indicative central nervous system activation ( include tremor , convulsion , ataxia , dyspnea , dilate pupil , prostration , abnormal vocalization , increased respiration , excess salivation , gait abnormality , hyper- hypo-excitability ) . These clinical sign consider represent exaggerated pharmacology fampridine . It would appear limiting toxicity would rule concern regard potential mutagenicity , carcinogenicity , teratogenicity fampridine . During Fampyra development program , 1900 subject expose fampridine 57 clinical study . The frequent treatment-related adverse event ( AEs ) report fampridine subject MS , well population , include subject spinal cord injury , may broadly categorize excitatory effect nervous system consistent K+ channel block activity compound nervous system . These AEs include dizziness , paresthesia , insomnia , balance disorder , anxiety , confusion , seizure . In study MS patient , follow frequent treatment-related AEs also observe : urinary tract infection , asthenia , back pain , constipation , dyspepsia , pharyngolaryngeal pain . At high dose level , severe central nervous system AEs confusion seizure see . With adoption 10 mg BID dose extension study , rate first seizure approximately 0.32 per 100 subject-years . This rate exceed expect incidence seizure MS population , particularly advanced disease state significant ambulatory disability18 . However , patient exclude study history seizure evidence epileptiform activity screen electroencephalogram . Seizures see post marketing set US although confound factor seizure history use concomitant medication associate seizure risk may contribute occurrence seizure patient . No new safety signal detect March 2011 . The FDA recently approve Fampridine , slow release preparation , use MS patient population.8 It also recently approve Europe ( 20th July 2011 ) .17 Most study fampridine assess timed walk twenty-five foot Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 ( MSWS-12 ) .3-5 Deficits arm hand function commonly find patient SPMS PPMS impact perform many activity daily live .
