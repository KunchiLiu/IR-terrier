	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose genetically modify T-cell immunotherapy treat patient malignant glioma come back ( recurrent ) respond therapy ( refractory ) . A T cell type immune cell recognize kill abnormal cell body . T cell take patient 's blood modify gene place laboratory may help recognize kill glioma cell . Genetically modify T-cells may also help body build immune response tumor cell . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility safety intratumoral ( stratum 1 ) , intracavitary ( stratum 2 ) , intraventricular ( stratum 3 ) , dual delivery ( intratumoral intraventricular ) ( stratum 4 ) cellular immunotherapy utilize ex vivo expand autologous central memory T cell ( TCM ) -enriched T cell genetically modify use self-inactivating ( SIN ) lentiviral vector express interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 ( IL13Rα2 ) -specific , hinge-optimized , 41BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) , well truncate human cluster differentiation 19 ( CD19 ) ( IL13 [ EQ ] BBzeta/truncated CD19 [ ] + TCM ) ( IL13Rα2-specific , hinge-optimized , 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes ) , research participant recurrent/refractory malignant glioma . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose schedule ( MTD ) recommend phase II dosing plan ( RP2D ) stratum base dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) full toxicity profile . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time extent brain inflammation , assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , follow T cell administration . II . To describe cytokine level ( cyst fluid , peripheral blood ) study period . III . In research participant receive full schedule three CAR+ T cell dos : estimate six month progression free survival rate , disease response rate , median overall survival . IV . In research participant receive intraventricular infusion progress follow intratumoral/intracranial infusion ( stratum 1 2 ) : estimate disease response rate overall survival sample size large enough . V. In research participant receive least one dose CAR+ T cell estimate mean change baseline quality life use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality life questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C30 EORTC QLQ brain neoplasm ( BN ) -20 survey scale , domain item score post treatment . VI . For study participant undergo second resection autopsy : To evaluate CAR+ T cell persistence tumor micro-environment location CAR+ T cell respect injection site , evaluate IL13Ra2 antigen expression level pre post CAR+ T cell therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 4 stratum . Patients receive IL13Rα2-specific , hinge-optimized , 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via intratumoral ( stratum 1 ) intracavitary ( stratum 2 ) intraventricular ( stratum 3 ) dual delivery ( intratumoral intraventricular ) ( stratum 4 ) catheter 5 minute weekly 3 week absence disease progression . Beginning early 1 week later , patient may receive additional T cell infusion long continue remain eligible product available . Patients progress intracavitary intratumoral administration may move intraventricular catheter optional infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 month yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
