	<detailed_description>Introduction The `` R-GNOSIS : Ecological Effects Decolonization Strategies Intensive Care '' study assess three decolonization intervention standard care evaluate unit wide ecological effect compare effectiveness . Previous study demonstrate decontamination intervention beneficial individual patient also influence ICU ecology , affect patient receive intervention . Decolonization antibiotic show reduce prevalence resistant bacteria treatment [ de Smet et al . NEJM 2009 ] . Reducing presence bacteria patient ( decolonize ) , reduce cross transmission therefore beneficial patient unit . The decolonization strategy therefore represent intensive care unit population rather individual patient intervention . In respect study represent cluster-cluster randomized clinical trial require intervention undertaken whole ICU population [ Edwards et al . BMJ 1999 ] . As decolonization strategy represent ecological intervention whole critical care population , patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enter study accord ethic approval participate country . Each participate ICU use three decolonization strategy randomise order . The intervention administer four time daily ventilate patient extubation . The intervention compare 6 month baseline period consist standard care . Standard operate procedure Standard care The baseline period first 6-month period use implement universal `` standard care '' : - Chlorhexidine 2 % body washing ( CHX-BW ) ICU patient . CHX-BW ensures state art standard care prevent carriage transmission ( resistant ) gram positive bacteria commonly reside body surface , Staphylococcus aureus Enterococci . - A hand hygiene improvement program ( HHIP ) base program design World Health organisation ( WHO ) . Implementation hand hygiene program derive WHO hand hygiene program ensure state art standard care transmission prevention relevant pathogen . - Standard oropharyngeal care consist oral wash sterile water ( 3-4 time daily ) tooth brush twice daily . `` Standard care '' protocolised intervention baseline period use throughout entire study . Intervention period After baseline period , first decolonization regimen implement . The order regimens per ICU decide randomization . The three regimen : - Chlorhexidine oral care ( CHX-Oro ) chlorhexidine 1 % oromucosal gel . - Selective oropharyngeal decontamination ( SOD ) antibiotic . SOD consist application paste contain colistin , tobramycin 2 % concentration nystatin 1 x 10^5 unit . - Selective digestive decontamination ( SDD ) , 10 ml suspension via nasogastric tube contain 100 mg colistin , 80 mg tobramycin nystatin 2 x 10^6 i.u . added application SOD paste . All intervention period last 6 month regimen apply four time daily . In contrast SDD study , systemic prophylaxis Cefotaxime ( broad spectrum cephalosporin ) implement part SDD . Patient recruitment All patient ICU receive standard care minor anonymized personal data collect . Once monthly point prevalence culture collect patient ICU day . Eligible patient ICU - addition mention - receive one intervention undergo surveillance sample . More anonymized personal data collect ( include clinical culture result ) . A waiver inform consent place , patient opt data collection . Culture sample Point prevalence culture take monthly patient present ICU moment . These include rectal swab respiratory sample serve purpose monitoring evaluate ecological change regimen . Surveillance culture take twice weekly include patient also include rectal swab respiratory sample . The sample collect measure treatment effect . Finally , result regularly obtain culture clinical purpose ( blood respiratory sample ) record measure treatment effect . Data-collection Data-collection perform two method . All data `` anonymised '' recode patient identifier ( ID ) study patient ID remove personal identifier . 1 . A web base electronic case report form ( ECRF ) design within `` Research Online '' . This system meet requirement accord International Conference Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice ( ICH-GCP ) standard electronic data entry respect safeguard data integrity data security regulation . 2 . Automatic extraction data electronic patient data dossier may perform technically possible without harm patient ' privacy . Data dictionary - Data patient admit ICU include sex , age , disease severity score , admission/discharge date , mechanical ventilation ( yes/no ) duration , ICU-survival . - Data include patient additionally include : hospital admission date , place admission , reason ICU admission , acute illness ( yes/no ) , sit organ failure , antibiotic use ICU-admission ( yes/no ) , comorbidity , ventilation data , disposition 28-days ICU- admission , ICU-discharge hospital-discharge , isolation precaution . - Culture data include result clinical respiratory blood sample surveillance culture include patient point prevalence culture ( monthly ) patient . - Ward-level antibiotic use record per study period . Sample size calculation In Dutch SDD ICU trial day-28 mortality rate baseline period 27.5 % ( 3 ) . Assuming low level cluster-effects , 2016 patient need phase demonstrate 10 % relative reduction day-28 mortality compare Standard Care ( alpha=0.05 ; beta=0.8 ) . We intend include 2700 patient per arm . The margin 600 patient per arm include allow adjustment difference baseline characteristic random-effects logistic regression model need , include cluster-effects . Of note , assume day-28 mortality standard care 27 % , absolute reduction demonstrate 2.7 % . Day-28 mortality data derive clinical data obtain part routine standard care . Statistical analysis plan Analysis determine effect intervention colonization rate , occurrence bacteremia use antibiotic . Statistical analysis primary objective secondary objective regard mortality , antibiotic use rate colonisation bacteraemia include use random-effect logistic regression model account ICU-level clustering . Measured confound factor fit covariates . Outcome present odds ratio . All available data patient colonization MDR-GNB ( screen clinical culture ) use determine , carefully possible , extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) colonization status patient every study day . Nosocomial transmission capacity ( RA-values ) different specie MDR-GNB study regimen quantify . As secondary aim species-specific RA value compare ward . Available data use quantify incidence cross-transmission study period , use sophisticated modeling approach . Investigators R-GNOSIS staff make every attempt collect complete data subject enrol study . Where possible , automatic extraction data hospital information system use ( without disclose patient identifier ) . There regular contact study coordinate centre study sit track retrieve miss data . Should culture result inadvertently lose , data treat miss random . All inferential analysis base available data . Details procedures address miss culture provide Statistical Analysis Plan . Details analysis method change analysis describe protocol documented statistical analysis plan prior database lock . Those change reason change describe detail final study report , present regulation authority ethical committee substantial amendment . Quality safety assurance plan The quality study assure two method . 1 . An external safety committee ( SCom ) consist three expert objective guard ecological safety study . During intervention period ( CHX-Oro , SOD , SDD ) , SCom issue recommendation continue stop study quarterly basis ( three monthly ) , base result monthly point prevalence culture input participate ICUs . The primary safety measure detect increase anti-microbial drug resistant bacteria perform point prevalence culture patient participate ICUs . The purpose culture evaluate ensure ecologic safety . Analysis detect multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria ( MDR-GNB ) , vancomycin resistant enterococci ( VRE ) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) isolate . Also , susceptibility /MDR-GNB colistin , use SDD SOD , test . This way , increase number resistant isolates detect early . 2 . Guidelines report suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR 's ) develop . In ICU patient , co-morbidity natural history underlie critical illness cause event would meet definition ( serious ) adverse event . Given natural occurrence event low risk adverse drug reaction base broad experience current study medication , follow adverse event record : 1 . Adverse event possibly relate medication ( judged medical scientific judgement ) AND 2 . Deemed serious medical scientific judgement ( judge either investigator treat physician ) AND 3 . Not part natural history underlie critical illness Adverse event meeting criterion report local investigator within follow time limit : - coordinating investigator within 24 hour - accredit Institutional Review Boar ( IRB ) approve protocol country ( within 7 day event life-threatening fatal , within 15 day event life-threatening fatal ) - competent authority country ( within 7 day event life-threatening fatal , within 15 day event life-threatening fatal ) 3 . A monitoring plan develop , : 1 . The SPONSOR complete central monitor form participate hospital every three 3 month . This form register example quality transfer data , recruitment rate occurrence site specific problem . 2 . Each participate hospital completes site self-monitoring form every three month . This form register completeness Investigator Site File , completeness drug accountability correct report suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR 's ) .</detailed_description>
