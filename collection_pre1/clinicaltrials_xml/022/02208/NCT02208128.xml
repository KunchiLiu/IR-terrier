	<brief_summary>Aim scientific analysis find biological factor ( biomarkers ) allow prediction disease progression well choice therapy . After diagnosis kidney tumor remove standard surgery follow drug therapy . Within surgery remain tumor tissue use scientific analysis . In case disease progression drug treatment drug therapy change . Before therapy change small tissue sample collect molecular diagnostics . This do puncture skin local anesthesia . Blood sample take surgery time first second disease progression also use molecular-biological analysis . As clear recommendation drug therapy disease progression study serve determine individual therapy basis molecular profile molecular change . As tumor disease change develop resistance drug , analysis time disease progression shall identify biological factor predict likelihood response specific drug . This shall allow give patient individual therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim study perform profound molecular analysis tumor begin therapy failure approve targeted first-and second line therapy ( standard therapy ) . The tumor sample analyze use profound molecular analysis identify target structure predict efficacy specific therapy ( substance group ) therefore predictive value . The analysis molecular biomarkers include genomic sequencing target area entire DNA tumor tissue comparative DNA healthy cell , measurement DNA-regulatory element ( methylation , mi-RNA expression , protein expression analytics , functional tumorcell analysis in-vitro , efficacy analysis cell culture animal model ) suppose inspect biological influence molecular biomarkers measurement free tumor DNA blood . The response establish standard therapy first second line acquire due clinical radiological establish standard parameter . The clinical-radiological response correlate molecular change change therapy process allow predictive prognosis therapy . There approved clinical standard third line therapy . However medication approve without scientific evidence efficacy therapy situation ( third line treatment failure first second line treatment ) response 6 week expect . For patient third line therapy adjust molecular profile previous therapy . Therefore oncological history notice marker profile presence target structure ( know influence certain substance ) consider . The therapy use substance approve general treatment metastatic renal cell cancer .</detailed_description>
