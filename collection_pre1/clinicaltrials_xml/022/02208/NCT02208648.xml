	<brief_summary>The study investigate whether presence coronary artery calcium demonstrate pre-operative , thoracic staging Computed Tomography ( CT ) independent risk factor 90 day mortality patient undergo major abdominal surgery . The study research question : Do high level coronary calcification correlate increase risk post-operative mortality patient undergo major abdominal surgery ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study use retrospective observational study design . Due nature subject study retrospective design patient contact necessary imaging review acquire part routine level care . Plan gather study data A list patient follow surgical code identify hospital surgical performance database create retrospective dataset 5 year ' worth case ( December 2013 ) . This date range may extend ensure adequate sample size . : Surgical code ( Healthcare Resource Groups ( HRG ) code ) include : F31 Large Intestine - Complex Procedures F32 Large Intestine - Very Major Procedures F33 Large Intestine - Major Procedures complication comorbidities ( w cc ) F34 Large Intestine - Major Procedures without complication comorbidities ( w/o cc ) F36 Large Intestinal Disorders &gt; 69 w cc F37 Large Intestinal Disorders &lt; 70 w/o cc F41 General Abdominal - Very Major Major Procedures patient 69 year age ( &gt; 69 ) w cc F42 General Abdominal - Very Major Major Procedures patient 70 year age ( &lt; 70 ) w/o cc F46 General Abdominal Disorders &gt; 69 w cc F47 General Abdominal Disorders &lt; 70 w/o cc Cross-reference Somerset Cancer Register remove recognised bowel cancer . This patient list cross-referenced record peri-operative mortality ( within 90 day ) Propensity match decease patient patient survive beyond 90 day . Our matching rule descend order importance : - HRG code - gender , - cancer stag - Age+/-5yrs . - American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Grade Where multiple potential match resolve consultation research team member . Pairs CT scan ( deceased plus matched control ) procure WebPACS ( Web Picture Archival Communication System ) . Scans anonymised store dedicated secure radiology research server . Abbreviated Calcium score generate patient trial train radiologist use calcium score method . Calcium burden record scale 1-12 . The radiologist blind group patient belongs , minimise bias . Scans ( deceased patient match control ) analyse batch 30 pair . Radiologist ( ) blind group allocation . Scans `` pair '' time reading . Interim statistical analysis ( calcium score ) perform batch scan .</detailed_description>
