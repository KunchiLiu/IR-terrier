	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : The purpose prospective study evaluate role inflammatory biomarkers predict procedure-outcome AF patient undergo catheter ablation . Background : AF common arrhythmia clinical practice , affect &gt; 2.3 million people US . It increase dramatically age see many 9 % individual age 80 ( 1 ) . A major cause stroke , AF also associate 2-fold increase mortality ( 1 ) . Symptomatic AF demonstrate consistently associate elevated inflammatory activity atrial tissue evidence fact AF occur 40 % patient follow cardiac bypass surgery 50 % patient undergoing valvular surgery ( 2 ) . Recent study also demonstrate elevated CRP level increase risk AF 31 % ( 2 ) . Oxidative damage experience AF lead myocardial necrosis turn induce low-grade inflammation result eventual fibrosis atrial myocardium . Thus , inflammation responsible adverse structural electrical remodel cardiac tissue perpetuate existence , maintenance , recurrence arrhythmia . Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) evolve promising curative therapy drug-refractory AF . However , recurrence AF RFCA common clinical problem , occur 25-50 % patient follow-up period ( 3 ) patient undergo multiple ablation procedure cure arrhythmia . Published retrospective study demonstrate systemic inflammation generate AF ablation associate few early arrhythmia recurrence ( 4 ) . Therefore , measurement inflammatory marker within 24 hour RFCA could helpful exploration association degree inflammatory activation procedure outcome . Myriad Rules-Based Medicine , Inc ( Myriad RBM ) Austin , TX 78759 develop biomarker panel validate detect early sign inflammation . Myriad RBM process blood sample preliminary panel 77 biomarkers , identify possible predictor procedural outcome RFCA AF patient . Study design : This study assess panel 77 biomarkers human serum sample identify pilot study result potential predictor procedural outcome catheter ablation AF . The study population consist 150 volunteer patient AF undergo RFCA . Blood sample collect two time point patient ; one baseline morning procedure . Study Procedure : For patient , one 8.5 ml tube whole blood collect via venipuncture morning ablation procedure . Ablation Procedure : Standard radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure occur accordance physician 's discretion . Blood sample collection : The whole blood sample collect Serum Separator Tube ( SST ) use BD venipuncture procedure , label anonymous patient identifier . Only clinical research staff able identify study participant . Following collection , sample centrifuge 15 minute 900Xg room temperature , within two hour collection . Plasma , locate clear straw-color fluid top specimen , would transfer another sterile tube store -200 C. Samples pick weekly RBM team store -800 C end study , sample simultaneously analyze . Limited information also record age , gender , height , weight , caffeine intake information medication , smoke history , family history atrial fibrillation ( know ) , information outcome procedure . Researchers RBM blind patient history demographic data . After study complete researcher RBM store leftover blood . The researcher may use leftover sample future unspecified research study , may may relate AF procedure . Even blood sample use study , researcher way identify patient . Follow-Up : At 6 12 month time point , information collect medical record regard recurrence AF . Risk Analysis : Minor risk associate venous blood draw may include faint bruising , pain discomfort 1/1000 risk infection site blood drawn .</detailed_description>
