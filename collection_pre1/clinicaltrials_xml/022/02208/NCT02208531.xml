	<brief_title>Transition Scale Nutrition Psychosocial Stimulation Program Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 200 million child &lt; 5 yr reach full potential due poor nutrition inadequate cognitive stimulation . Nutritional Care ( NC ) alone insufficient correct developmental deficit malnourish child psychosocial stimulation ( PS ) also require . Objectives : 1 . Pilot two intervention method different delivery model provide NC+PS refine intervention identify difficulty . 2 . Conduct cluster randomize control trial ( CRCT ) NC+PS malnourish child . 3 . Pilot feasibility provide NC+PS group mother instead individual quasi-experimental design . Methods : The study consist 3 different sub-studies : 1 . The pilot qualitative study conduct 10 Community Clinics ( CCs ) involve 40 child ( age 6-33 month ) per CC . Mothers child attend clinic every 2 week hour play session group 2 6 . We explore different delivery model ass problem focus group discussion parent staff CCs . 2 . For CRCT survey child age 6-24 mo 140 CCs identify malnourish . We randomize CCs NC+PS control , randomly select 40 child CC evaluate random subsample 6 child CCs use anthropometry , Bayley-III , Wolke 's behavior rating family care indicator ( FCI ) baseline endline . 3 . The quasi experimental study conduct 10 CCs randomize group-intervention control 40 mother child per CC . Mothers come CCs group 6 child every fortnight . The child test begin 12 month use tool main study . Outcome variable : The main outcome child 's language , mental psychomotor development measure Bayley-III . In addition expect improvement FCI mother 's child rearing knowledge practice . We also conduct cost analysis base success indicator , cost per successful outcome calculate total cost intervention program .</detailed_description>
