	<brief_summary>Each year , 3 million neonatal death occur worldwide great 200 million child age 5 , almost low- middle-income country , fulfil developmental potential . The development grow brain affect multiple mechanism include insult major cause mortality , namely hypothermia infection . The first month life crucial period neurodevelopment ( ND ) . In study , investigator propose home-based use integrate evidence-based toolkit improve health status , reduce incidence neonatal insult may affect brain development , decrease neonatal mortality rate ( NMR ) , provide early identification danger sign . The investigator hypothesize use neonatal toolkit result improvement least one standard deviation neurodevelopment measure 12 month age Protocol Child Monitoring Infant Toddler ( PCM-IT ) version .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year 3 million global neonatal death . While significant progress make overall 5 mortality past decade , minimal progress make reduce neonatal death represent 40 % deaths child age 5 . The majority neonatal death occur rural area develop country approximately two third due infection complication relate low birth weight ( LBW ) prematurity . Additionally , 200 million child 5 year old , almost low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) , fulfil developmental potential . To date , neonatal intervention trial LMIC focus reduce mortality little research perform consequence severe non-fatal neonatal insult neurodevelopment ( ND ) . Subsequently , little known intervention may reduce risk long-term neurocognitive sequela . The first month life critical period ND significant neurogenesis , synaptogenesis , myelination . Stimulation infant 's brain period may significant downstream positive effect . Development grow brain affect multiple mechanism include insult major cause mortality , namely hypothermia infection . Reducing incidence insult period may save life also save brain improve ND outcome .</detailed_description>
