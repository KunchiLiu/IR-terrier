	<brief_summary>Bioavailability iron zinc habitual plant-based diet consume young child Mexico low due high phytate content . Whey protein found increase zinc absorption , thus , provide whey base supplement micronutrient may effective strategy increase iron zinc bioavailability plant-based food alleviate iron zinc deficiency . The investigator compare absorption zinc iron child receive diet without whey protein supplement ( WPS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study 1 : Zinc absorption study The zinc study employ 2-day cross-over design , label WPS diet different zinc stable isotope ( 67Zn ) control diet ( 70Zn ) . All meal 2-day period label tracer . The dual isotope ratio technique use 3rd Zn stable isotope ( 68Zn ) give intravenously urine enrichment isotope measure Study Days 6-9 measure fractional absorption Zn ( FAZ ) . The amount Zn absorb day determine multiply Zn intake day ( determine lab analysis duplicate test meal ) FAZ . Children ( n=16 ) randomize order consume test control meal Study Day 1 2 . Study 2 : Iron absorption study The iron study cross sectional study one group receive control meal second group receive control meal plus WPS . Iron absorption measure use erythrocyte iron incorporation technique label meal 2 day ( 58Fe ) . This precede reference dose Fe57 ascorbate previous day . Children ( n=32 ) randomize receive control diet intervention diet ( control diet + WPS ) .</detailed_description>
