	<brief_summary>The objective study compare quantity Zn absorb accurately weigh quantity ( ~100 g ) minimally mill control maize ( ~15 µg Zn/g maize ) , biofortified maize ( ~30 µg Zn/g ) control maize fortify ( total level ~60 µg Zn/g ) feed young child age 24-36 month whose major habitual food staple maize .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorption Zinc ( Zn ) From Zn-biofortified Zn-fortified Maize Young Zambian Children Between 24-36 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participating child randomize receive accurately weigh quantity ~100g/day either control , fortify biofortified study maize 1 day . On day 1 , mother bring child health center breakfast . All meal extrinsically label zinc stable isotope ( 70Zn ) . Meals day consume presence research staff . The quantity nshima porridge prepare eaten accurately weighed duplicate meal collect subsequent mineral analysis . Between lunch dinner day 1 Health Center , blood sample collect Hb plasma Zn analyse , immediately needle , stable isotope zinc intravenously administer forearm vein 1-2 minute . The family return home . Morning spot urine sample collect twice daily start day 5 continue day 8 . Once collection finish , study child complete . Dietary Zn measure laboratory assay duplicate test meal . Fractional absorption Zn ( FAZ ) measure dual isotope tracer ratio method urine . Absorbed Zn calculate multiply dietary Zn FAZ .</detailed_description>
