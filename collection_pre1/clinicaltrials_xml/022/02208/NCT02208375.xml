	<brief_title>A Phase Ib Study Oral PARP Inhibitor Olaparib With Oral mTORC1/2 Inhibitor AZD2014 Oral AKT Inhibitor AZD5363 Recurrent Endometrial , Triple Negative Breast , Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study agree , enrol study group base join study . Up 3 group 30 participant enrol Dose Escalation part study , 60 participant enrol Dose Expansion part . If Dose Escalation group , assign combination dose level one following : - Olaparib AZD2014 take every day , - Olaparib take every day AZD2014 take 2 day 5 day If first group , begin take olaparib alone Week -1 ( week Week 1 ) Days -3 , -2 , -1 . Then take AZD2014 alone Days 1-4 Week 1 . You start take olaparib Day 5 Week 1 AZD2014 every day rest Cycle 1 . For Cycle 2 every cycle , continue take olaparib AZD2014 together every day . If second group , begin take olaparib alone Week -1 Days -5 , -4 , -3 . Then take AZD2014 alone Days 1 2 Week 1 . You start take olaparib Day 3 Week 1 continue every day rest Cycle 1 . For Cycle 2 every cycle , take olaparib every day . You add AZD2014 dose schedule start Week 2 Day 8 , 2 day on/5 day schedule . Up 5 combination dose level test Dose Escalation group . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group may receive high dose study drug group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . If Dose Expansion group , receive either combination olaparib/AZD2014 olaparib/AZD5363 high dose combination schedule tolerate escalation group . Study Drug Administration : You take olaparib 2 hour within 2 hour eat . The olaparib tablet swallow whole 8 ounce ( 1 cup ) water . You chew , crush , dissolve , divide tablet . If take AZD5363 AZD2014 , fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) least 2 hour dose 2 hour dose . You take dos time morning evening . You avoid sugary fatty food take dose study drug . The study drug take order . If vomit shortly olaparib tablet swallow , dose replace intact tablet see count . If miss schedule dose , take dose 2 hour schedule time . If 2 hour pass scheduled time , miss dose take wait next scheduled time . Study Visits : Each study cycle 4 week . The following test procedure perform : Each Week Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . If study doctor think need , also pelvic exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw check CA-125 level . - You EKG . - One ( 1 ) time Weeks 1 2 , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) draw 2-4 hour study drug dose test blood sugar level . If Dose Expansion group , Cycle 1 ( 4 week start study drug ) , image-guided biopsy tumor biomarker test . Every 4 week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test check level fat blood . - After Cycle 1 , ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw check CA-125 level . Every 8 week : - Blood ( ½ teaspoon ) drawn test blood sugar . - You CT scan MRI check status disease . After Cycle 2 , ECHO every 8 week whenever study doctor think need . After 6 month , CT scan every 3 cycle check status disease . Pharmacokinetic Testing : Blood ( ½ teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . The time point draws depend upon study group : - If take olaparib AZD2014 every day , PK draw Days -1 , 4 , 8 . - If take olaparib every day AZD2014 2 day 5 day , PK draw Days -3 , 1 , 8 , 9 . Length Study : You receive study drug long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test check level fat blood blood sugar level . - You EKG ECHO . - You CT scan MRI check status disease . - If ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw check CA-125 level . This investigational study . Olaparib commercially available FDA approve treatment certain type ovarian cancer . Its use study investigational . AZD2014 AZD5363 FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The use study drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 150 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
