	<detailed_description>On average , 3-8 % German population suffers neuropathic pain , occur damage somatosensory nerve peripheral central nervous system . In term `` personalize '' medicine , strict separation neuropathic chronic pain allow individualize therapy reduce pain severity enhance patient ' quality life . Currently , diagnosis neuropathic pain base medical history , subjective description somatosensory symptom application ( non-genetic ) diagnostic test . To improve diagnosis therapy complex disorder individual patient , novel method introduce base flow cytometric ( FACS ) analysis human immune cell analysis human genome ( genomics ) . Those technique support identification characteristic feature indicate ongoing individual pathophysiologic process body ( biomarkers ) . Often diseases base complex relationship genetics , environmental factor manifestation disease . To capture complexity via genomics , phenotypical genotypical data high quality detail information study population require . This observational study include patient suffer painful non-painful neuropathy associate HIV-infection , diabetes mellitus breast cancer . With targeted application validate questionnaire ( Brief Pain Inventory , Pain Catastrophizing Scale , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , Ten-Item Personality Inventory , 36-Item Short Form Health Survey , Insomnia Severity Index ) parallel usage genomics FACS analysis select biomarkers blood , study provide information manifestation certain gene immune marker directly correlate symptom disease . Additional performance neuropsychological/cognitive test quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) enhance phenotypic profile . Identification potential indicator could utilize prospectively precisely diagnose effectively treat neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
