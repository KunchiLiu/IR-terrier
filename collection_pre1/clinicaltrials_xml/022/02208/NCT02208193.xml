	<brief_summary>Gardens art represent public space support venue interaction emotion , seek variety conversational theme also various cognitive skill mnemonic skill . The cognitive psycho-behavioral effect art garden , jointly associate make available patient suffer Alzheimer 's disease , need evaluate . MAIN OBJECTIVE Delineate psychological scaffolding virtue art garden cognitive emotional process mean interview analysis Alzheimer patient control subject base `` art , memory life `` garden . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Adapt eco-psychosocial approach care management Alzheimer patient : - create assessment method : - therapeutic efficacy design `` art , memory life `` garden , - perception artistic dimension live environment Alzheimer 's disease , - establish : - workshop application use art garden therapeutic purpose , - general recommendation layout garden . PRIMARY ENDPOINT Quantitative data discursive production stem Interlocutory Logic ( Trognon Batt , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 ) analysis interactive behavior assessment parameter include esthetic appraisal , well-being , mnemonic emotional process ( frequency nature process ) well spatio-temporal orientation . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS - Scores obtain standard neuropsychological test , particular ass spatio-temporal orientation ( Folstein MMSE ) , - Scores obtain `` MemoArtZ `` tool ( MAZ ) evaluate memorization artistic element garden , - Scores `` General Esthetic Preference `` ( GEP ) tool evaluate consistency general esthetic appreciation , - Score obtain specific mood assessment scale ( CSDD ) subject group A , - Score obtain specific assessment emotional event scale ( AES ) subject . RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Open , monocentric , control ( group healthy control subject ) study . Population : 2 group : Group A `` Alzheimer group '' : patient mild severe stage Alzheimer 's disease : subgroup A1 `` Alzheimer group hospitalize Paul Spillmann Centre ( Centre Paul Spillmann , CPS ) '' ( CHU de Nancy , France ) ; subgroup A2 `` Alzheimer group monitor Resource Research Memory Centre ( Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche , CMRR ) '' ( CHU de Nancy , France ) Group B `` healthy control group '' : healthy volunteer Therapeutic fallout study benefit Alzheimer patient term well care management , notably : ) determine design , conception layout garden destine patient , ii ) develop introduction artistic dimension design heal garden live environment , iii ) establish workshop application perspective use contemplation work art garden therapeutic purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY / EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Open , monocentric , control ( group healthy control subject ) study . Population : 2 group : Group A `` Alzheimer group '' : patient mild severe stage Alzheimer 's disease : subgroup A1 `` Alzheimer group hospitalize Paul Spillmann Centre ( Centre Paul Spillmann , CPS ) '' ( CHU de Nancy , France ) ; subgroup A2 `` Alzheimer group monitor Resource Research Memory Centre ( Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche , CMRR ) '' ( CHU de Nancy , France ) Group B `` healthy control group '' : healthy volunteer SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES TASKS SPECIFIC TO THE STUDY : MATERIALS Interview methodology : The interrelationship garden , art , cognition behavior assess . The endpoint dimension achieve analysis subject-psychologist interaction via interview garden ( in-context ) out-of-context mnemonic interview . These interview record transcribed verbatim . The interest juxtaposing two interview situation , comparative analysis interactional production , able access different cognitive skill order analyze skill . All data extract quantitative analysis discursive production stem Interlocutory Logic ( Trognon Batt , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 ) . The investigator analyse consist , one hand , explore public production private thought subject ( cognition emotion ) secondly , modelize interactive behavior . The interlocutory space referential modal . All , investigator observe analyze eventual discursive production subject reference `` art , memory life '' garden , whether related subject 's experience garden ( in-context ) , narrative situation recount experience garden ( out-of-context ) spontaneous use garden subject group A1 . The implemented approach strong ecological perspective . Interlocutory logic analysis method develop INTERPSY laboratory . This pragmatic-dialogic method analyze discourse situation interaction . This analytical process aim expliciting basic component communication , interlocutory management socio-cognitive-discursive event occur conversation . For subject Group A : Mood assessment : Cornell Scale Depression Dementia ( CSDD , Cornell , 1988 ) , translate French . For subject Group A Group B - Assessment emotional event : Apathy Scale : Marin 's Apathy Evaluation Scale ( AES ) - Questionnaire artistic cultural activity ( ACA ) pertain artistic cultural activity subject appreciates and/or engage engage . - Assessment general esthetic preference : `` General Esthetic Preference '' ( GEP ) tool - Designed along line use Kawabata Zeki Halpern et al . respective study ( Kawabata Zeki , 2010 ; Halpern et al. , 2008 ) . - Materials : photograph represent work art - painting sculpture - belonging three style : figurative , stylize abstract , represent category - live non-living . - Task perform subject : photograph present , subject 's task express esthetic judgment use visual analogue scale . After collect subject 's esthetic judgment , esthetic emotion assess two propositional question . - Objective : Document feeling relative person 's preference certain artistic style . Interview-discovery interview-knowledge garden ( in-context ) ( 30 min per interview ) : During walk-through , subject , accompanied psychologist , observe entire garden artistic element . The subject queried discussion aim promote express immediate reaction artistic dimension . The analytical approach enable ass : - esthetic preference artistic element integrate garden - mnemonic emotional process ( nature frequency ) mobilize contemplation element garden , whether vegetation artistic . - expression well-being curiosity prompt work art - mnemonic process refer temporality space Out-of-context assessment ( 90 min per assessment ) : - Mnemonic interview ( 30 min ) : closed office blind outside , psychologist invite subject recall experience garden . In word , subject ask narrate experience outside context . In situation , context must formalize verbally lead mobilization cognitive skill mobilize first in-context situation . - General esthetic preference ( GEP tool ) : This assessment reveal perseverance certain esthetic preference , conversely , detachment relative certain style category address prior first walk garden . - Mnemonic aspect artistic element `` MémoArtZ `` ( MAZ ) tool : - Task perform subject : view photograph represent various work art discover garden , insert amidst distractive element . - Instructions : `` Show photograph represent item saw garden '' . - Aim : analysis enable objectify potential encode memory recall refer artistic element garden . - The mnemonic process regard temporality space also bring light exchange initiate open question , particularly around theme current season year . The investigator observe whether fact garden allow subject change readjust eventually inadequate response give MMSE ( context aid ) . - Mood assessment ( CSDD ) subject group A - Assessment emotional event ( AES ) subject group A B .

The analysis include comparison different time period study . Between-group comparison frequency ( sick patient versus healthy subject paired series different study time ) perform Fisher Chi2 test McNemar test , comparison mean nonparametric test pair t-test paired series accord condition application test .
