	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis IV , also know MPS IV Morquio disease , rare autosomal recessive genetic lysosomal storage disorder . Research thus far regard Morquio , primarily focus physical aspect various disease . Less attention pay psychological toll disease , whether direct symptom reaction live chronic progressive disease . Prior 2013 , neither cure treatment ( palliative ) Morquio disease . In latter half 2013 , ERT become available broad population patient Morquio A disease BioMarin 's Expanded Access Program . In previous study , entitle `` Psychological Concomitants Morquio syndrome '' present investigator enrol 20 adult subject Morquio pilot study estimate baseline incidence psychological symptom overall quality life . Subjects age 18 . Data study publish 2015 . The present study extend research psychological health Morquio via comparison psychological issue quality life treatment ( i.e . ERT ) . As ERT cross blood-brain barrier , would unlikely improve organic psychological symptom , may improve reactive psychological symptom cause living time chronic progressive genetic disease . The present study thus seek follow adult patient Morquio A disease begin ERT track psychological health every 6 month duration 2 year . Adult patient Morquio disease invite participate . Subjects complete three different self-report questionnaire , Achenbach System Empirically Based Assessment ( ASEBA ) Adult Self-Report ( ASR ) , Short Form 36-item Health Questionnaire ( SF-36 ) , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . Group aggregate data report ; individual questionnaire content result hold confidential , except accordance Georgia law relate report child elder abuse , suicidal and/or homicidal intent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidosis IV , also know MPS IV Morquio disease , rare autosomal recessive genetic lysosomal storage disorder . Research thus far regard lysosomal storage disease ( LSDs ) general , include Morquio , primarily focus explore cause find treatment physical aspect various disease . Less attention pay psychological emotional toll disease , whether direct symptom diseases reaction live chronic progressive disease . It well establish health psychology literature , however , interaction physical health psychological health bidirectional ; , physical health affect u emotionally ( e.g . chronic pain contribute depression ) , psychological health affect u physically ( e.g . anxiety contribute feeling chest pain ) . It thus critically important pay attention emotional psychological symptom associate lysosomal storage disease , include Morquio , expand treatment standard care include mental health treatment , necessary . The first step understand treat psychological condition Morquio disease determine natural occurrence psychological symptom population comparison non-medical population . As little do regard , pilot study document occurrence rate psychological issue overall quality life patient Morquio first item order focus study . Approximately 20 patient Morquio disease invite participate , recruit Emory 's Lysosomal Storage Disease Center , well attendance Morquio support group relevant regional , national and/or international meeting . Once consent , patient ask complete three different self-report questionnaire , include Achenbach System Empirically Based Assessment ( ASEBA ) Adult Self-Report ( ASR ) Older Adult Self-Report ( OASR ) questionnaire , Short Form 36-item Health Questionnaire ( SF-36 ) , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . Group aggregate data report ; individual questionnaire content result hold confidential , except accordance Georgia law relate report child elder abuse , suicidal and/or homicidal intent . Completion questionnaires complete subject ' participation pilot study .</detailed_description>
