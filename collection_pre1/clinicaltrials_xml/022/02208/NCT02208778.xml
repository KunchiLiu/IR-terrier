	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) degenerative joint disease common form arthritis . Pain reduction functional recovery key element clinical management OA . Current treatment guideline recommend combination pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment . However , always effective , nearly 20 % patient respond standard therapy , include joint replacement . The mechanisms pain relief well understood complicate remarkably large placebo effect , inter-individual variation . There objective criterion predict whether patient respond give treatment Duloxetine , antidepressant drug , proven effectiveness various chronic pain syndrome include knee OA . The effect however limit clinically relevant around half trial patient . Importantly , currently unclear duloxetine alleviate chronic pain . Advanced MRI technique use strong magnetic field radio frequency signal generate metabolic , anatomical functional brain image ( fMRI ) . Remifentanil potent analgesic agent whose analgesic effect well characterise healthy volunteer , include fMRI study show modulation activation region brain related pain processing . Nevertheless , neural correlate remifentanil effect yet investigate chronic pain patient . The aim research use combination multimodal MRI , genetic psychometric assessment identify mechanism pain relief knee OA patient , follow treatment duloxetine remifentanil , placebo control condition . With also aim identify genetic , anatomical brain activity predictor treatment outcomes . The main hypothesis : - Analgesic response duloxetine treatment predict use range baseline brain image marker QST . - Analgesic response duloxetine mediate modulation neural network underpin emotional control . - Duloxetine-induced change brain activation differ responders non-responders . This study expect last two year . It fund Arthritis Research United Kingdom form part wider scientific investigation , use translational methodology , enhance understanding arthritis pain improve treatment .</brief_summary>
