	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction demonstrate early marker coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . On hand , myocardial perfusion single photon emission compute tomography ( MP-SPECT ) widely use technique evaluation patient suspect known CAD . Preliminary data suggest myocardial perfusion heterogeneity ( potential surrogate marker endothelial dysfunction ) assess conventional MP-SPECT , additive independent prognostic value presence myocardial ischemia remain unknown . Accordingly , purpose study evaluate prognostic value myocardial perfusion heterogeneity assess new automatized image processing method apply routine MP-SPECT . The main hypothesis presence myocardial perfusion heterogeneity predictive 2-year cardiovascular event patient refer Nuclear Cardiology Department routine evaluation know suspected CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . SPECT image protocol analysis Stress test SPECTs perform accord routine protocol use . Briefly , end stress ( exercise test dipyridamole injection 0.36 mg/kg 4 minute ) , 115 185 37.5 megabecquerel 201Thallium inject intravenously , initial gate image record 10 minute later . Three hour stress , 37.5 megabecquerel 201Thallium re-injected rest new gate acquisition 15 minute later ( rest reinjection image ) . Images acquire use dual-head rotate digital gamma camera 180° circular orbit ( 32 projection ) . A uniform imaging pre-treatment reconstruction raw myocardial perfusion image data apply , image reconstruct reoriented obtain transaxial section leave ventricle accord three standard cardiac plane . 2 . Myocardial Heterogeneity Index ( Hi ) Markovian texture homogeneity analysis characterize image examine probability pixel give intensity neighbour different intensity , Pd ( ) probability 2 adjacent pixel intensity value differ m. For study Hi give equation : Hi = ∑m [ 1/ ( 1+m ) 2 ] Pd ( ) . Therefore , Hi value 0 ( non inclusive ) 1 ( inclusive ) . A value near 0 represent image high probability neighbour pixel intensity value differ greatly , therefore high level myocardial perfusion heterogeneity . Conversely , value close 1 represent image high probability neighbour pixel similar intensity value , therefore depict low level myocardial perfusion heterogeneity .</detailed_description>
