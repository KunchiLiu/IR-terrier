	<brief_summary>This single-blinded randomized control trial try compare effectiveness diagnosis two technique employ tissue sample subepithelial tumor ( SETs ) gastrointestinal tract . Over 2 year , patient SET randomize either get EUS-guided core needle biopsy ( EUS-CNB ) EUS-guided single-incision needle knife ( SINK ) technique . This grave importance diagnosis myriad type SETs make histologically require good sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS-CNB Versus EUS-SINK Diagnosis UGI Subepithelial Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) subepithelial tumor ( SETs ) tumor arise subepithelial layer esophageal , gastric duodenal wall , mostly submucosa muscular layer . The incidence SETs routine endoscopy 0.36 % The differential diagnosis SETs include , though limited : lipoma , leiomyoma , aberrant pancreas , varix , carcinoid , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) , lymphoma . Therefore , correct diagnosis tumor important guide subsequent management . These lesion often accurately diagnosed cross-sectional imaging . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) aid narrow differential diagnosis lesion often able establish layer origin . However , accurate diagnosis target therapy make solely morphological feature histologic type time mitotic index . Thus need technique obtain histology beneficial guiding management . Since standard endoscopy pinch biopsy overlie mucosa often fail provide adequate sample analysis , multiple modality sample lesion utilized : EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) , EUS-guided core needle biopsy ( EUS-CNB ) , bite-on-bite forceps biopsy , EUS-guided single-incision needle knife ( SINK ) endoscopic resection . EUS-FNA consider usual method sampling ; however , diagnostic yield low : 38 % 82 % . Moreover , EUS-FNA often provide insufficient specimen may allow immunohistochemistry often essential diagnosis . Thus EUS-CNB assess purpose obtain core sample allow histological assessment . Published data reveals diagnostic ( though histologic ) yield use EUS-CNB 75 % In 2011 , SINK technique sample present report diagnostic accuracy 92.8 % [ 8 ] . The technique utilizes conventional needle-knife connect electrosurgical unit . A 6 12-mm mucosal incision make lesion . Then conventional biopsy forceps introduce obtain 3-5 sample . Subsequently , incision close 2 3 endoclips . The purpose study prospectively compare efficacy safety EUS-CNB SINK patient upper GI SETs . The investigator hypothesis SINK technique superior EUS-CNB obtain histological specimen . The result study would provide data may improve diagnostic ability SETs . This turn guide appropriate surveillance management ( surgical endoscopic ) patient lesion .</detailed_description>
