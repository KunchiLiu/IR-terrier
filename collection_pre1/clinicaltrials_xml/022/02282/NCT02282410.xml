	<detailed_description>Hemophilia A X-linked recessive , congenital bleeding disorder cause deficient defective coagulation factor VIII ( FVIII ) . The absence severe reduction FVIII lead 'spontaneous ' bleed episode ( occur primarily joint , muscle , less commonly , soft tissue ) excessive bleed follow trauma injury . Estimations base WFH 's annual global survey indicate number people hemophilia world approximately 400,000 . [ 1 ] China account quarter 100,000 . Currently , base successful pioneer work Dr Nilsson colleague Sweden start late 1950 's , prophylaxis recommend standard care boys severe haemophilia WHO WFH . [ 2 ] The efficacy safety prophylaxis prevent bleeds arthropathy patient hemophilia confirm well-designed clinical study . [ 3,4,5 ] To keep factor level 1 % , standard dosage patient severe hemophilia A 20-40 Units /kg/infusion ( average 30 Units /kg ) [ 6 ] every day three time week . This dosage high consumption factor , 5000-6000 international unit ( IU ) /kg/year . [ 7 ] The high consumption factor cost present major barrier use standard prophylaxis many country particularly develop world . [ 8 ] Many family look forward standard prophylaxis reduce bleed episode , stop slow deterioration joint disease son severe hemophilia thus improve quality life ( QoL ) . But China majority boys severe hemophilia A afford high cost standard prophylaxis .They pay on-demand treatment low-dose prophylaxis . But Advate Patient Assistance Program ( Golden Key ) launch 24 Apr 2014 Nanjing China , affordability patient solve many patient get chance receive standard prophylaxis . This study design evaluate Annual Bleeding rate ( ABR ) , joint health outcome QoL outcomes subject use standard prophylaxis condition routine practice .</detailed_description>
