	<brief_summary>Patients advance ( ACCF/AHA stage D ) heart failure hyperuricemia high one-year mortality . Currently , evidence-based therapy mechanically assist circulatory support available China . The investigator find glucocorticoid treatment prednisone could improve cardiac performance , potentiate renal responsiveness diuretic patient . Therefore , could use bridge therapy help ACE inhibitor beta blocker titration . With help , patient stage D heart failure could titrate high dose ACE inhibitor beta blocker hospitalization . However , efficacy long-term , low-dose prednisone use patient limited life expectancy remain unclear . Therefore , investigator design study observe whether put low-dose prednisone patient stage D heart failure long term could improve survival . All patient receive prednisone treatment hospitalization receive maximum tolerate guideline-directed medical therapy ( GDMT ) . After discharge hospital , patient randomize receive long-term , low-dose prednisone treatment standard GDMT .</brief_summary>

Progressive deterioration renal function ( e.g. , rise BUN creatinine ) 2 . Weight loss without cause ( e.g. , cardiac cachexia ) 3 . Intolerance ACE inhibitor due hypotension and/or worsen renal function 4 . Intolerance beta blocker due worsen HF hypotension 5 . Frequent systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg 6 . Recent need escalate diuretic maintain volume status , often reach daily furosemide equivalent dose &gt; 160 mg/d and/or use supplemental thizide therapy 7 . Progressive decline serum sodium , usually &lt; 133 mEq/L 8 . Gastrointestinal symptom ( abdominal discomfort , nausea , poor appetite ) , disable ascites , severe lowerextremity edema Any condition ( heart failure ) could limit use prednisone Any concurrent disease likely limit life expectancy ; Active myocarditis , hypertrophic obstructive restrictive cardiomyopathy ; Myocardial infarction , stroke , unstable angina , cardiac surgery within previous 3 month ; Indication hemodialysis Uncontrolled systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg Complex congenital heart disease Poorly control diabetes</criteria>
