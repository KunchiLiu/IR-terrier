	<criteria>Locally and/or regionally advanced ( M0 ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( AJCC Stage IIIIVB ) , cytologically pathologically confirm Department Pathology MSKCC , curativeintent radiation therapy plan . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 Adequate organ function laboratory parameter define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5X ULN ( upper limit normal ) bilirubin ≤ 1.5X ULN creatinine ≤ 1.5X ULN Fasting glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment male least 4 month thereafter female least 3 month thereafter . Negative serum pregnancy test ( βhCG ) within 72 hour start study treatment woman childbearing potential . Able understand voluntarily sign informed consent form , able comply study visit schedule protocol requirement . Low risk tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) Sexually active male must use condom intercourse take drug 16 week stop treatment father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Patient able swallow retain oral medication Any prior know radiation therapy head neck area Clinically significant cardiac disease impair cardiac function : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) require treatment ( New York Heart Association ≥ grade 2 ) , Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 50 % dose determine multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram , uncontrolled arterial hypertension define blood pressure great 140/80 mmHg rest ( average 3 consecutive reading ) History current evidence clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , atrial fibrillation and/or conduction abnormality , ( e.g . congenital long QT syndrome , high grade\complete AV blockage ) . Acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , coronary angiography angioplasty stenting ) , &lt; 3 month prior screen QT interval adjust accord Fredericia ( QTcF ) &gt; 480 msec screen EKG Patient clinically manifest diabetes mellitus , document steroid induce diabetes mellitus Patient history another malignancy within 2 year prior start study treatment , except cure basal cell carcinoma skin excise carcinoma situ cervix Patient recover grade 1 good ( except alopecia ) relate side effect prior antineoplastic therapy Patient systemic therapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior study entry Patient undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment recover side effect procedure Any condition would , investigator 's judgment . preclude patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure , e.g . infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , social/psychological complication Impaired GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patient participate prior therapeutic investigational drug study within 30 day prior enrollment Patient currently receive warfarin coumarin derive anticoagulant , treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , fondaparinux allow Patient currently receive treatment drug know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A . The patient must discontinue strong inducer least one week must discontinue strong inhibitor start treatment . Switching different medication prior start treatment allow ; ( Refer Appendix 2 ) . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active hepatitis B , and/or active hepatitis C infection Patient know hypersensitivity excipients BYL719 Patient know hypersensitivity cetuximab monoclonal antibody Patient know history noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) Women Patient apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment : a. Sexually active male use condom intercourse take drug 16 week final dose study treatment father child period , may recommend seek advice conservation sperm . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid b . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study least 16 week final dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception define either : . Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] . ii . Female sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment iii . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . [ For female study subject , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient ] iv . Use combination follow ( a+b ) : 1 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 2 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . 3 . Note : Hormonal contraception method ( e.g . oral , injected , implant ) allow BYL719 may decrease effectiveness hormonal contraceptive . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . Patients nasopharyngeal carcinoma eligible .</criteria>
