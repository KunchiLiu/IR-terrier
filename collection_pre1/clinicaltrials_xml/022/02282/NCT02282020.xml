	<detailed_description>This open label , randomise , control , multi-centre study ass efficacy safety single agent olaparib vs. standard care , base physician 's choice single agent chemotherapy ( i.e paclitaxel , topotecan , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , gemcitabine ) platinum sensitive partially platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer patient carry germline deleterious suspect deleterious BRCA mutation receive least 2 prior line platinum base chemotherapy . Patients eligible undergo BRCA test even yet recurrence progression disease &gt; 6 month ( &gt; /=183 day ) completion last platinum therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must ≥ 18 year age Patients histologically diagnose relapse high grade serous ovarian cancer ( include primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer ) high grade endometrioid cancer . Patients eligible undergo BRCA test even yet recurrence progression disease &gt; 6 month ( &gt; /=183 day ) completion last platinum therapy . Documented germline mutation Breast Cancer susceptibility gene : BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious ( know predict detrimental/lead loss function ) At least one lesion accurately assess baseline CT/MRI suitable repeat assessment . Patients must receive least 2 prior platinum base line chemotherapy Patients must partially platinum sensitive platinum sensitive Patients must suitable start treatment single agent chemotherapy base physician 's choice Patients must normal organ bone marrow function measure within 28 day randomisation , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must life expectancy ≥ 16 week Formalin fix , paraffin embed tumour sample primary recurrent cancer must available central test . BRCA 1 and/or BRCA2 mutation consider non detrimental Exposure investigational product within 30 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior randomisation Any previous treatment Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose polymerisation ( PARP ) inhibitor , include olaparib . Patients platinum resistant refractory disease Patients receive systemic chemotherapy within 3 week prior first dose study treatment Previous single agent exposure select chemotherapy regimen randomisation . Prior malignancy last 5 year , unless curatively treat recurrence free ( exception apply ) .</criteria>
