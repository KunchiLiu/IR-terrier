	<brief_title>Development Feasibility Incentive Scheme Promote Walking/Cycling School</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study use two-arm cluster randomise controlled design ; Year 5 group ( respective school ) unit randomisation . Participants Year 5 pupil , age 9-10 . Data collect throughout approximately three month . In total , assessment carry nine week period , excludes interval week baseline first intervention week , half-term ( school holiday ) . All child Year 5 's select school approach participate allocate randomly ( accord school attend ) two arm : ( ) intervention group take part incentive scheme ( ii ) control group receive ongoing curricular advice active travel . Parents ' participation consist complete socio-demographic questionnaire consent form , complete daily form ( answer daily text message ) report whether child actively traveled school ( AST report ) . A number school invited participate email . A reply post , phone email lead researcher request within two week , end pending school contact phone confirm decision . Of interested , two school select , ideally match characteristic location , free school meal AST rate . Once two participate school identify , meet person arrange head teacher time/place choice . The researcher visit school introduce RIGHT TRACKS study Year 5 class . After study present question answer , information pack send home pupil 's school folder . This pack include information leaflet child , information leaflet parent/carer , parent questionnaire , participant information sheet consent form . Two point stress confidentiality freedom drop study time without give justification . After read chance ask question ( phone/email lead researcher ) , parent require formally consent ( opt procedure ) child 's participation . Parental questionnaire consent form expect filled home phone email inquiry may make researcher work hour . Within one week delivery , parent request return complete sign document researcher . Specific method distribution collection decide school beforehand accommodate local circumstance preference . Questionnaire completion request parent , however return sign consent form essential determine child 's participation . In addition , participate child complete assent form classroom . Baseline assessment Following identification participant , child school give instructed wear accelerometer waist band lateral hip ensue seven day , moment get go bed , except water-based activity certain sport . Together accelerometer , child give parent AST report form , he/she must take home return end seven day period , complete parent , together accelerometer . Four question ask parent parent AST report form , relation day week : e.g . `` On Monday child walk cycle school , part journey ? `` , `` At time child leave home ? `` , `` At time child arrive school ? `` , `` Did child stop anywhere way ? If yes , long stop ? ____ minute '' . Upon collection accelerometer complete parent AST report form , child 's AST form fill classroom retrospectively relation five previous school day ( morning ) . The question ask child relation five day : e.g . `` On Monday walk cycle school , part journey ? '' At end baseline week , comply study protocol reward , state advance information material : prompt return complete parent AST report form undamaged accelerometer , complete child AST report form classroom , essential requisite receive £5 thank voucher . Intervention phase The next stage RIGHT TRACKS consist test feasibility incentive scheme . Similar baseline , quality data three source - accelerometry , parental AST report child self-report AST - examine . In particular , validity parental child-reported AST assess vis-à-vis accelerometry , currently consider one gold-standards . However , parental report AST use basis incentive scheme . Once , intervention control condition , £5 thanks voucher every child take part measurement procedure , compliance protocol . At end study , debrief sheet hand participant , include parent child , two head teacher . Intervention group - incentive scheme The incentive scheme explain intervention group introductory session . Partway active trip give particular emphasis . Each subsequent session anticipate take 25 minute per week classroom time . The incentive scheme run intervention school consist prize draw take place week . The prize £5 shopping gift voucher valid number high street shop . Chances win depend entirely number `` point '' : number active trip school report exclusively parent AST report form , question use baseline . For week day travel school child get one point . This point equivalent ticket child 's ID number enter draw . Each child earn zero five ticket per week , depend number active travel trip school report parent . Discrepant number parental report report child record accelerometer great interest measurement , disregard purpose draw . In absence parent AST report , child report may use point count , child remind parental report necessary next draw . A difference baseline intervention phase concern format parent AST report form , may complete writing , SMS text message week child wear accelerometer . Preference either option state advance consent form . Parents ask keep , fill return time every week ( personally via child ) , programme proceeds . Mobile phone respondent notify daily SMS , reply directly . Questions ask paper version mobile phone . However , two week child wear accelerometer , participant ask use parent AST report . When child wear accelerometer , question ask parental form text message whether child walked/cycled school part journey . For wear accelerometer intervention school , point credit long first question answer ( i.e . parent indicate whether child actively travel fail complete question time ) . During intervention phase , three task expect child : ( 1 ) wearing accelerometer another seven-day period , must return classroom , together parent AST report form , ( 2 ) return parent AST report form remain week ( applicable ) ( 3 ) complete AST report form classroom day draw . Thank voucher ( £5 ) issue timely receipt accelerometer ( together AST form ) , even accelerometer turn worn requested time ( i.e . least four day , include least one weekend day , 10 hour day ) . The researcher retire different room ( section school ) base parent AST report form , point relative five previous day calculate . In case SMS , responses gathered evening , researcher 's workplace , next day 's point credit receive 12noon ( state every text message parent receive draw day ) . Class score anonymously display graphic/chart week-after-week , printed version possible hand necessary . Depending school 's preference availability , logistics count point produce ticket may slightly different . For example , teacher may agree return complete parent AST report school office morning , case researcher could collect prepare ticket advance . After produce ticket , researcher return classroom distribute accelerometer next batch user . Once thank voucher accelerometer sort , draw finally take place classroom . A ticket pick black string bag , probably school staff member researcher . Depending parental choice specify consent form , incentive scheme voucher provide winner straight away , leave school office later collection parent . The class score graphic/chart put display wall . Control group - normal curricular AST advice With exception incentive scheme , identical procedure follow intervention control group . Each week , new group participant ( e.g . next five list ) request wear accelerometer , return parent AST report form ( applicable ) complete AST report form . Qualitative study One component study consist semi-structured interview child , parents/carers stakeholder , experimental control group , explore different perspective associate propose intervention trial procedure help refine . Willingness interview express consent form baseline case parent ( addition assent form case child ) , purposive sample select base socio-demographic variable assess questionnaire . The researcher directly invite teacher head teacher , turn suggest stakeholder interview among acquaintance ( snowball sampling ) . The aim interview dropout participant throughout intervention phase ( soon leave study ) , full participant immediately study end ( January 2015 ) . Sessions expect last 30-45 minute adult 15-30 minute child . Verbal consent take part session audio-taped request onset ( case child , parent first verbal assent ) , confidential nature record reiterate . Data securely store compliance Newcastle University 's regulation .</detailed_description>
