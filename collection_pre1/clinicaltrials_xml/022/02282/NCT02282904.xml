	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) cause immune system problem . Treatment usually bone marrow transplant fully match donor . Researchers want try use partially match donor patient fully match donor available . The researcher also use drug cyclophosphamide try improve outcome use partially match donor . Objective : - To learn effectiveness use cyclophosphamide transplant partially match donor treating CGD . Eligibility : - Recipients : age 2-65 CGD ongoing infection cure standard treatment fully match donor available appropriate timeframe . Design : - Recipients : - admit hospital 2 week transplant . - screen blood urine test , breathe heart health test , X-rays , and/or magnetic resonance imaging . They may bone marrow aspiration biopsy . - meet social worker dentist . - get chemotherapy , radiation , medicine . - get intravenous ( IV ) catheter chest . - transplant . - get medicine standard supportive care . - blood drawn frequently . - stay Washington , D.C. area 3 month post-transplant . - follow closely first 6 month , less frequently least 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical Transplant People With Chronic Granulomatous Disease Using Post Transplant Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic transplant use HLA match donor , relate unrelated , proven curative patient various immunodeficiency , include ongoing infection . However donor availability remain limiting factor application treatment modality . The use haploidentical donor past fraught great rate complication relate high rate GvHD delay immunorecovery . Newer transplant regimen appear diminish risk improve outcomes . We propose use subablative conditioning regimen follow post-transplant cyclophosphamide patient CGD HLA match donor whose circumstance necessitate use potentially curative , albeit high-risk treatment modality .</detailed_description>
