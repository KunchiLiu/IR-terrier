Parent interview every 3 month review medical record throughout time use evaluate way parental preference aggressiveness treatment change time ( Aim 1 ) . Parental perception care burdensome evaluate possible driver change decision-making ( Aim 2 ) . Ideally , parent value care would primary driver treatment goal . Thus evaluate extent parental understanding prognosis , treatment option , expect benefit burden treatment allow decision-making consonant parental preference absence prior negative experience care ( Aim 3 ) . Finally , in-depth parent interview allow u evaluate personal factor drive parental decision-making ( Aim 4 ) .
