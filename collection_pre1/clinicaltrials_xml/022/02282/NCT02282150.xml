	<brief_summary>Despite optimize hydrocortisone replacement regime , many patient adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) suffer impaired quality life ( QoL ) . Characteristically , patient report high fatigue level certain time day . A modified-release hydrocortisone show improve QoL , particularly fatigue , patient primary AI . However , unknown , effect observe patient secondary AI . Further , study evaluate effect , take account diurnal variation fatigue . A novel survey method term Ecological Momentary Assessments ( EMA ) potential provide reliable measurement diurnal variation patient-reported outcome , fatigue . We compare effect modified-release compare conventional hydrocortisone fatigue patient secondary AI due pituitary disease , hereby assess feasibility EMA outcome future large-scale randomised clinical trial ( RCTs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified-release Compared Conventional Hydrocortisone Diurnal Fatigue Secondary Hypoadrenalism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct open-label , single-arm , two-period , crossover pilot trial . Includible patient observe 5 week usual treatment ( twice thrice daily hydrocortisone ) . Assessments QoL , term EMA assessment , use baseline measurement study , collect 20 day precede 5 day technology adaptation phase . Thereafter participant shift modified release hydrocortisone ( Plenadren ) daily ( OD ) , dose per Summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) . Assessments QoL use outcome intervention study perform 12.5 week initiation Plenadren intervention treatment , order take consideration period re-adjustment body switch conventional hydrocortisone Plenadren . As do baseline observation , EMA measurement precede five day technology adaptation phase . At end intervention treatment period , patient shift usual hydrocortisone treatment follow outpatient clinic accord directive clinic . Biochemical parameter ; blood sample , DEXA scan , 24 hour blood pressure salivary cortisol , assess baseline 16 week , part safety evaluation Plenadren .</detailed_description>
