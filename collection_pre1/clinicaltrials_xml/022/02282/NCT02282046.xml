	<brief_title>Diabetes Effects Long-Term Implant Survival Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center prospective observational cohort study seek clarify role glycemic control risk determinant survival dental implant biologic complication dental implant therapy patient type 2 diabetes . Long-term implant stability implant-related complication assess relation glycated hemoglobin level time poorly-controlled well-controlled diabetic non-diabetic participant . Primary : To determine impact glycemic control type 2 diabetes patient implant-related biologic complication , integration survival dental implant long-term functional loading ( &gt; 1 year ) . Secondary : To examine association relative long-term effect sub-optimal glycemic control two different anatomic/restorative scheme ( fix partial removable complete ) Outcomes : Assessments include implant survival , implant-related biologic complication resonance frequency analysis measure implant stabilization . Outcomes analyzed relative glycated hemoglobin level ( HbA1c ) take 6-month interval course study . The total study population consist 163 participant follow least 2 year . This include enrol group 141 patient previously receive implant therapy part short-term assessment regard diabetes . In addition , study plan enroll 42 participant would benefit implant support denture therapy do prior study . These participant classify 3 separate group depend A1C reading time implant placement . The criterion follow group HbA1c &lt; 6.0 % ( non-diabetic ) , 6.0 % &lt; HbA1c &lt; 8.0 % ( well control diabetic ) 8.0 % &lt; HbA1c &lt; 12.0 % ( poorly control diabetic ) . A review potential participant 's health complete time screening . The implant surgeon determine patient healthy surgery anticipate health complication . If health concern evident precludes implant placement , patient exclude study participation . The age requirement study 25 year age old . It expect participant 50 year due specific clinical requirement treatment follow . Individuals gender , race , ethnicity may participate study . Most patient live locally San Antonio , TX surround city .</detailed_description>

For participant exist implant therapy : participate either two previous observational diabetesimplant study monitor implant outcome glycemic level conduct Dr. Oates [ IRB study # : HSC20070499H &amp; HSC20080156H ] . For edentulous participant without exist implant therapy : Diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus occur 1 year prior enrollment ( selfreported verify physician report , test result , and/or treatment record ) healthy , nondiabetic HbA1c &lt; 6.0 % , either FPG &lt; 100 mg/dl OGTT &lt; 140 mg/dl ( 2 hr ) within 11 month prior surgery ; participant must complete maxillary mandibular denture determine clinically acceptable study dentist ; must identify need 2implant support mandibular overdenture use standard diameter Straumann 4.1 mm implant . Male female , age 25 99 . HbA1c &lt; 12 % . Women reproductive potential must report negative urine pregnancy test within 2 week enrollment study , agree use highly effective contraception study period . Acceptable method birth control include abstinence , oral contraceptive , contraceptive patch , contraceptive ring , condom . Medical condition , laboratory finding , physical exam find precludes implant placement therapy ( include cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal , metabolic , neurologic , pulmonary , endocrine , autoimmune , psychiatric disorder ) . Current medication history treatment know effect bone turnover , include : calcitonin , systemic steroid , bisphosphonates , estrogen progesterone therapy . Presence acute untreated oral infection inflammatory lesion . History HIV infection , Hepatitis B C determine patient report medical record . Selfreported history illicit drug use alcohol abuse ( Appendix D ) . Implant site bone grafting procedure use autogenic allogenic material less one year prior placement , require bone graft conjunction implant placement . Implant site alloplastic grafting procedure . Presence disease affect bone metabolism , limited : hyperthyroidism , hyperparathyroidism , congenital connective tissue disorder ( e.g. , osteogenesis imperfecta ) , Paget 's disease . Participation clinical study may interfere participation study implant surgical phase heal 4 month follow placement . Selfreported current tobacco use Anything would place individual increase risk preclude individual 's full compliance completion study .</criteria>
