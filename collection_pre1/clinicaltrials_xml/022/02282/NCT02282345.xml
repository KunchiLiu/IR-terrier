	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Talazoparib Patients With BRCA Deleterious Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main Study : Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , take talazoparib capsule mouth 1 time day time every morning . While require , caregiver , advise wear glove handle talazoparib capsule . You give study drug diary write time take talazoparib miss vomit dos . You return complete study drug diary study drug bottle unused study drug study visit . While require , caregiver , advise wear glove handle talazoparib capsule . If side effect , study doctor may decide low study drug dose stop take drug . You may able restart study drug low dose . The study doctor discus . On day study visit , take dose study drug clinic . Do take dose study drug home day . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Every week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If study doctor approves , may return clinic Days 8 15 Cycle 2 . You may blood draw do local laboratory result send study doctor . Your study doctor discus . On Days 1 , 8 , 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker , PGt , proteomic testing . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , ultrasound breast ( ) check status disease . Within 7 day complete treatment talazoparib : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker , PGt , proteomic testing . - You core biopsy image-guided FNA check status disease biomarker , PGt , proteomic testing . After last dose Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ultrasound breast ( ) check status disease . After Cycle 2 , receive chemotherapy and/or surgery remove tumor part standard care disease . You give separate consent form describe procedure risk . During surgery , tissue remove collect check status disease biomarker , PGt , proteomic testing . After surgery , may call study doctor ask . This call last 10 minute . Cell line create use collect tissue . Cell line blood tissue cell grown laboratory research animal . Xenograft model create use collected tissue . A xenograft take graft tissue one donor transplant another . For study , take graft tissue transplant mouse help u good understand BRCA mutation . After surgery , receive chemotherapy part standard care disease . Length Treatment : You receive 2 cycle study drug.You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If stop take study drug disease get bad , image-guided core biopsy FNA perform biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers , proteomic testing , PGt test . This perform start new chemotherapy treatment part standard care . Your participation study surgery . This investigational study . Talazoparib FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 20 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson . Expansion Cohort : Study Visits : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , take talazoparib capsule mouth 1 time day time every morning .

Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Day 1 Cycle 3 Day 1 Cycle 5 , ultrasound breast ( ) check status disease . After receive study drug 6 cycle , surgery remove tumor part standard care disease . You give separate consent form describe procedure risk .
