	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy four time daily Positive Expiratory Pressure ( oPEP ) ( Aerobika ® ) maneuver three week individual bronchiectasis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic sputum production . The investigator hypothesize four time daily positive expiratory pressure use Aerobika ® significantly improve dyspnea , movement mucus , St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) score , six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) three week four time daily administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure ( oPEP ) Bronchiectasis COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cough sputum production common Bronchiectasis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , associate significant morbidity adverse clinical outcome . Airway clearance technique ( ACTs ) afford oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure ( oPEP ) ( Aerobika ® ) aim remove sputum lung , however evidence efficacy stable disease unclear . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy four time daily Positive Expiratory Pressure maneuver three week individual bronchiectasis COPD chronic sputum production . The oPEP device ( Aerobika ® ) combine positive expiratory pressure therapy airway vibration help mobilize pulmonary secretion . oPEP therapy enforces resistance exhalation mouth airway vibration technology transmit movement upstream exhalation airway wall may become free mucus . An adjustable dial allow user adjust frequency flow resistance base individual need . Subjects take device home use four time daily active part study . We hypothesize daily oPEP use significantly improve dyspnea , movement mucus , SGRQ score , 6MWD three week four time daily administration . This randomized cross-over unblinded study 30 subject : ten bronchiectasis 20 COPD ( chronic bronchitis chronic mucus production identify ) . Five subject Bronchiectasis group ten COPD group start oPEP use three week . All subject crossover Visit Two three week oPEP therapy three week therapy . Each subject visit centre three occasion : Baseline , Crossover Visit , Final Visit approximately one hour perform : 1 ) spirometry plethysmography , 2 ) 6MWT , 3 ) health status evaluation use self-administered SGRQ . Subjects first provide write informed consent complete : 1 ) SGRQ inhale 2-4 puff ( 200-400µg ) short-acting bronchodilator ( eg . Salbutamol ) , 2 ) plethysmography spirometry 35 ( ±five minute ) post-salbutamol . Vital sign document subject rest approximately 15 minute six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) post-salbutamol . Subjects give oPEP therapy system ( Aerobika ® ) use home , four time per day . Instruction training use device give baseline visit . Subjects require return device upon completion study .</detailed_description>
