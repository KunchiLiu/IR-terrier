	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy four time daily oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure ( oPEP ) ( Aerobika ® ) use 4 week individual stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The investigator hypothesize daily oPEP use significantly improve St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) score , six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) four week four time daily administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cough sputum production common chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , associate significant morbidity adverse clinical outcome . Airway clearance technique ( ACTs ) afford oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure ( oPEP ) ( Aerobika ® ) aim remove sputum lung , however evidence efficacy stable disease unclear . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy four time daily oPEP use 4 week individual stable COPD . The oPEP device combine positive expiratory pressure therapy airway vibration help mobilize pulmonary secretion . oPEP therapy enforces resistance exhalation mouth airway vibration technology transmit movement upstream exhalation airway wall may become free mucus . An adjustable dial allow user adjust frequency flow resistance base individual need . Subjects take device home use four time daily active part study . We hypothesize daily ( Aerobika ® ) use significantly improve St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) score , six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) four week four time daily administration . This randomized cross-over unblinded study 15 subject COPD . All subject cross-over four week oPEP therapy four week therapy . Each subject visit centre five occasion ( baseline , 2 week , 4 week ( cross-over ) , 6 week 8 week ) one hour perform : 1 ) spirometry plethysmography , 2 ) six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , 3 ) health status evaluation use self-administered St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . Subjects first provide write informed consent complete : 1 ) SGRQ inhale 2-4 puff ( 200-400µg ) short-acting bronchodilator ( eg . Salbutamol ) , 2 ) plethysmography spirometry 35±5 minute post-salbutamol . Vital sign document subject rest approximately 15 minute complete six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) post-salbutamol . Subjects give oPEP therapy system ( Aerobika ® ) use home , four time per day . Instruction training use device give baseline visit . Subjects require return device upon completion study .</detailed_description>
