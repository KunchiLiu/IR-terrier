	<brief_summary>This multi-center , proof concept phase 0 study assess suppression p-AKT Vestibular Schwannoma ( VS ) meningiomas AR-42 adult patient undergoing tumor resection . AR-42 small molecule cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) rodent , investigator certain yet penetrate human VS. Meningiomas outside BBB , seem unusually resistant current medical treatment . The primary endpoint bioactivity suppression p-AKT AR-42 select drug activity seem informative bioavailability . Our preclinical data others show dose dependent suppression p-AKT AR-42 VS meningioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center , proof concept phase 0 study assess suppression p-AKT VS meningioma AR-42 adult patient undergo NF2-tumor resection . AR-42 administer three time per week begin 3 week prior surgery . A total ten dos , +/- 1 dose 40 mg/dose , self-administered orally study participant approximately time every day ( +/- 1 hour , preferably even ) 3 time per week 3 week pre-operatively , last dose take night surgery . Patients evaluate within context standard post-operative follow include within 2 day surgery 2 week ( +/- 10 day ) surgery . Samples ship participate laboratory ( OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center ( CCC ) Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource ( PhASR ) Nationwide Children 's Research Institute ) assessment intratumoral drug concentration assessment intratumoral disease marker . During surgery , four blood sample also obtain send cooperate laboratory ( PhASR ) determination drug concentration molecular analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients vestibular schwannoma and/or meningioma diagnose MRI surgical resection select treatment . Patients diagnose NF2 must meet Manchester Criteria . Age &gt; 18 year age Prior biologic therapy , chemotherapy , surgery radiation permit . At time screening , patient must normal organ marrow function . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World Health Organization ( ECOG/WHO ) performance status 01 . Patients must able swallow capsule . Patients legal representative must able read , understand provide inform consent participate trial . Tumor type confirm neuropathologist . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL prior start AR42 . The patient must willing comply fertility requirement Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect AR42 know . Because unknown potential risk AEs nursing infant secondary treatment mother AR42 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated AR42 . Pediatric patient exclude phase 0 study effect AR42 know child potential direct benefit . Patients malabsorption condition opinion principal investigator could cause difficulty absorption drug . Patients require chronic corticosteroid ( dose equivalent &gt; 20mg prednisolone ) . Concurrent use complementary alternative medicine opinion principal investigator would confound interpretation toxicity and/or antitumor activity study drug . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy , opinion principal investigator , interfere patient participation , increase patient risk , confound data interpretation . Patients mean QTcB &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female . Patients long QT syndrome . Patients treat active infection . Patients receive follow concomitant medication : Any antineoplastic chemotherapy biologic therapy study Concomitant radiotherapy Concomitant HDAC inhibitor ( e.g . valproic acid ) classspecific adverse reaction may additive Use granulocyte colonystimulating factor include GCSF , pegylated GCSF GMCSF follow ASCO guideline patient receive anticancer therapy . Drugs associate QT/QTc prolongation ( see Appendix A ) Patients receive concurrent antineoplastic therapy . Any medical condition , include mental illness substance abuse , deem principal investigator likely interfere patient 's ability sign inform consent , cooperate participate study , interfere interpretation result . Patients significant cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month unstable cardiac arrhythmia eligible study . Known HIV infection , immunosuppressive condition may complicate potential pancytopenia see HDAC inhibitor complicate evaluation drug effect .</criteria>
