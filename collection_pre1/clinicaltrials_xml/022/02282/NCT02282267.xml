	<brief_summary>This study propose validate efficacy gefitinib first-line therapy advance lung adenocarcinoma EGFR mutation determine plasma cf-DNA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Detection EGFR Mutation For Iressa Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients without enough tissue EGFR mutation detection also opportunity use EGFR-TKI first line therapy . Meanwhile , study also propose explore best intervention time anti-resistant drug ( AZD 9291 , T790M inhibitor ) quantitative dynamic analysis EGFR sensitive resistant mutation plasma cf-DNA EGFR-TKI treatment process .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provision inform consent prior study specific procedure . Male female patient age range 18 75 year old . Histological confirmation lung adenocarcinoma . Attention : paraffin embed cytological sample extract pleural effusion acceptable . Adenosquamous carcinoma allow enroll . Sputum cytology alone acceptable . Bronchoalveolar lavage fine needle aspiration cytology specimen lesion also acceptable . Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma ( stage Ⅳ , IASLC , 2009 ) . EGFR sensitive mutation ( include exon 19 del and/or exon 21 L858R ) plasma cfDNA ddPCR . Chemotherapy , immunotherapy systemic anticancer treatment ( EGFR inhibitor include EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFR antibody , antivascular therapy include vascular epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor Endostar ) naïve . Radical surgery radiotherapy must complete least 6 month start study treatment . Adjuvant chemotherapy allow must finish least 6months start study drug . Palliative radiotherapy must complete least 2 week start study treatment persistent radiation toxicity . At least one lesion , previously irradiate , accurately measure baseline 10mm long diameter ( lymph node must short axis 15mm ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement . WHO Performance Status 0 , 1 2 . Criteria laboratory examination : Blood white cell count≥3.0*109/L , Neutrophile cell count ≥1.5*109/L Platelet count ≥100*109/L Total bilirubin ( TB ) ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2 time upper limit normal ; subject hepatic metastasis , AST , ALT≤ 5 time upper limit normal Creatinine clearance≥50ml/min Known severe allergic gefitinib excipient product . Considered require radiotherapy lung time study entry near future . Newly diagnose symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis spinal cord compression unless treat surgery and/or radiation stable without steroid least 2 week . Uncontrolled massive pleural pericardial effusion . Past medical history interstitial lung disease , druginduced interstitial disease , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease . The presence idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis baseline CT scan . Combined use phenytoin , rifampin , carbamazepine , pentobarbital St. John 's wort . Any obvious ocular anomaly , especially severe dry eye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , serious exposure keratitis potentially increase epithelial lesion . As judged investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g . active infection , uncontrolled hypertension unstable angina , congestive hear failure , liver , kidney metabolic disease ) . Could accept oral administration , need intravenous nutrition , previous operation affect absorption active peptic ulcer . Pregnant lactating woman . Prior administration study drug drug without approval within 30 day first day study drug administration . Other coexist malignancy malignancy diagnose within last 5 year , exception basal cell carcinoma cervical cancer situ completely resect intramucosal gastric cancer .</criteria>
