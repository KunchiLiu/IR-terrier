	<brief_summary>Hallux surgery know extremely painful . Standard pain therapy treatment NSAID opioid painkiller . Patients frequently not-satisfied . Some institution use nerve block ( single shot catheter technic ) ischiadic nerve . But procedure invasive , potential risk nerve lesion , accept surgeon . A single shot nerve block posterior tibial nerve less invasive could superior compare standard pain treatment . A great variability nerve supply foot well describe . There hint posterior tibial nerve supply first metatarsal bone first metatarsal joint . A nerve block could reduce postoperative pain hallux surgery . To assess effectiveness investigated measure , request morphine dose PCA pump use verify effectiveness tibial nerve block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Single Shot Block Posterior Tibial Nerve Postoperative Pain Relief After Hallux Valgus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose evaluate effectiveness tibial nerve block postoperative pain relief hallux surgery . The primary objective ass morphine requirement first 24 hour surgery . Secondary objective maximum pain score sleep quality postoperative period . Patient 's satisfaction pain therapy approximately nerve block duration ask final interview . Primary study endpoint 50 % reduction morphine requirement 60 % standard deviation within 24 hour surgery . Power 80 % , level significance set 5 % ( p &lt; 0,05 ) . Secondary endpoint sleep quality maximum pain score ( maximum VAS ) measure mean postoperative questionnaire .</detailed_description>
