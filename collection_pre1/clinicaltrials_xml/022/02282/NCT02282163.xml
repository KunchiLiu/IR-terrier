	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multicenter , open-label study conduct approximately 7-12 site United States , Canada Europe pediatric patient suboptimal LV EBD non-contrast 2D transthoracic echocardiography harmonic imaging . It estimate 92 patient enrol provide 73 evaluable patient . Three cardiologist unaffiliated enrol center ( blinded reader ) , blind patient 's identity clinical profile independently evaluate echocardiogram . The efficacy analysis primarily base blind reader evaluation . Imaging condition representative use routine clinical practice include LV EBD harmonic imaging modality . One sit participate study also request consent subset patient additional blood sample analysis SF6 concentration blood total 6 patient ( 3 male 3 female ) age group 9 12 year age 6 patient ( 3 male 3 female ) age &gt; 12 include 17 year .
