	<brief_title>Gastric Capsule Examination Iron Deficiency Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroscopy ( OGD ) useful test investigate variety suspect upper GI disorder . But uncomfortable patient incur risk intubation sedation , plus large proportion procedure reveal insignificant pathology . Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) investigation choice diseases small bowel . It safe , noninvasive well tolerate . The use CE traditionally restrict small bowel , although new capsule image oesophagus colon currently use . Previous capsule fail adequately image stomach due large volume rugal fold . Recently magnetic capsule handheld magnet developed ( Microcam Navi , Intromedic Ltd , Seoul , Korea ) enable element manoeuvrability capsule . This unnecessary small bowel capsule propel along ' tubular structure peristalsis , capacious stomach may allow capsule steer examine area stomach . The investigator already conduct two feasibility study porcine model promise result trial currently underway use equipment steer small bowel capsule stomach duodenum . The next logical step compare technique conventional standard upper GI investigationÍ¾ OGD . Patients recurrent refractory iron deficiency anaemia require combination gastroscopy small bowel capsule endoscopy part diagnostic investigation . The investigator wish undertake pilot prospective single blind control trial compare magnetically steerable gastric capsule examination conventional OGD diagnose upper gastrointestinal pathology patient recurrent/refractory iron deficiency anaemia .</detailed_description>
