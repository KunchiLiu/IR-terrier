	<detailed_description>Although current pharmaceutical therapy improve survival rate heart failure remain fatal disease associate poor 3-year survival . Increased sympathetic activity find patient heart failure play important role pathogenesis development disease [ Provide reference ] . Excessive activation sympathetic tone contribute arrhythmogenesis , increase cardiac wall tension , platelet aggregation , promote `` vicious cycle [ What cycle ? Elaborate . ] '' patient . High thoracic epidural anesthesia ( HTEA ) reversibly regionally block cardiac sympathetic nervous system . The method pioneer Prof. Liu Fengqi 1995 , accumulate clinical experience thousand case . His anecdotal experience indicate method favorably improve intractable angina , dilate cardiomyopathy , advanced heart failure . Though method use treat patient center many year , prospective trial effect cardiovascular function , efficacy improve clinical outcome . The investigator propose investigate immediate physiologic effect clinical effectiveness HTEA treat heart failure . Methods design The investigator propose double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial . 230 chronic heart failure patient course three month randomly allocate two group , 90 HTEA group , 90 sham-HTEA ( SHAM ) group . The investigator compare outcomes 50 historical control ( CON ) . Ethical approval institutional review board obtain . Patients consent appropriately , free withdraw study time . According guideline chronic heart failure treatment , diuretic , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker , beta-blockers , aldosterone receptor antagonist , digitalis , vasodilating agent use standard treatment heart failure three group . Outcome assessment perform objectively evaluator knowledge treatment assignment . HTEA procedure Patients HTEA group treat conventional medical therapy four week HTEA . The HTEA procedure follow : epidural catheter insert one second fifth thoracic interspaces . Three five milliliter 0.5 % lidocaine every 2 h administer induce blockade cardiac sympathetic segment ( Th1-Th5 ) . The catheter remain place lidocaine infuse continuously subsequent four week . Sham procedure Patients SHAM group treat conventional medical therapy four week sham-HTEA . SHAM group receive similiar procedure HTEA group , except infusion saline water rather lidocaine.. CON group receive conventional standard treatment . [ For first trial outcomes ambitious . Just initial physiologic experiment first understand happen CHF pt perform HTEA . Then follow pt next week ] Primary end point [ I would first start short term outcome . One could use model outline levosimendan trial http : //heartfailure.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx ? articleid=1671253 ] : Re-hospitalizing rate cause severe cardiac failure [ Over time ? I would suggest 4 week ] , re-hospitalizing rate cause cardiovascular disease ; NYHA cardiac function grading , live quality evaluation , 6 minute walk distance , echocardiography , [ When ? At 24 hour , 4 week ? ] dynamic [ Is ETT ? ] electrocardiogram , well peripheral blood NT-proBNP [ At 24 hr ? 48 hr ? 4 week ? ] change would compare . [ The statistical plan miss . Is 50 pt adequate evaluate early efficacy . Potentially see levosimendan trial power study . Their method follow : `` The sample size REVIVE II trial estimate basis follow assumption : proportion patient consider improve first 5 day would 50 % great levosimendan group placebo group ; proportion patient consider bad first 5 day would 33 % low levosimendan group placebo group ; expect rate improvement deterioration placebo group would 25 % ; study would &gt; 90 % power detect treatment difference ( Î± = 0.05 ) .
