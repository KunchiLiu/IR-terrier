	<brief_title>Immunolocalization 1,25 , Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Aggressive Periodontitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aggressive periodontitis ( AgP ) infectious disease periodontium affect young adult , cause damage support apparatus teeth , lead rapid bone resorption tooth loss . Its clinical feature show result several genetic environmental factor . This increased interest research genetic host factor may provide useful risk marker , reveal important information regard pathogenesis also identification effective preventive agent might help decrease disease burden . 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , apart traditional calcium-related action , active form increasingly recognize potent anti-proliferative , anti-differentiative immunomodulatory activity . The calcitriol activity largely mediate vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) whose expression describe tissue . VDR localize cytosol nucleus accumulates nucleus response 1,25 , dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding . Expression nuclear activation VDR necessary effect vitamin D. Thus , alteration vitamin D pathway lead disturbance mineral metabolism . It may hypothesize rapid bone loss occur aggressive periodontitis patient may due decrease absence expression Vitamin D receptor nucleus .</detailed_description>
