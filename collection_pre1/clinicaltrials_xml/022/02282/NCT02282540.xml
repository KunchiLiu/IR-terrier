	<detailed_description>Introduction Dysfunction auditory tube / Eustachian tube ( ET ) frequent problem may cause series middle ear condition . Middle ear atelectasis , retraction tympanic membrane , case `` retraction pocket type-cholesteatoma '' ( 5 ) , chronic otitis , perforation tympanic membrane conductive hearing loss due poor middle ear ventilation associate ET-dysfunction . The ET consist two part , mobile cartilaginous part medially , fixate bony part laterally . The bony part demarcate thin bony wall situate close proximity vulnerable anatomical structure , cartilaginous part support parapharyngeal soft tissue . Recent year , new treatment procedure ET balloon dilation emerge . Restoration ET function offer new approach large group patient great reduction symptom secondary middle ear disease . Only cartilaginous part ET accessible treatment procedure . We also know 20 % patient dilate respond dilation , relapse middle ear disease occur ( 2 ) . At present , diagnostic procedure distinguish later responders non-responders dilation . Therefore , level diagnostics obstruction possibly identification discriminate parameter important . Computer tomography ( CT ) consider necessary type tube intervention , mainly exclude obstruction bony part tube identification pathoanatomical condition contraindicate balloon dilatation . Visualisation obstruction cartilaginous part possible today 's method . Nor method provide information tube function . There need good diagnostic imaging ET . In project plan develop method contrast medium application ET via middle ear follow CT imaging . The purpose tell whether ET open level obstruct . So far publication show contrast medium pas ET ( 6,7,8 ) , systematic trial publish , clarify potential method . We recently conduct study temporal bone specimens human cadaver 8 live rabbit . Results study yet publish , hypothesis support method ET visualisation feasible , safe , contrast medium pass unhindered normal ET application middle ear ( 6,7,8 ) . Hence next step trial explore whether method provide new information human subject without tube dysfunction . Hypotheses Contrast medium apply middle ear pass ET visualise epipharynx follow CT examination temporal bone individual healthy middle ear ET . Contrast medium apply middle ear pas entire ET visualise epipharynx follow CT examination temporal bone individual patient group . It possible identify high level obstruction contrast medium application middle ear base visual identification low visible level contrast medium ET follow CT examination temporal bone patient group . Level obstruction ET predict outcome ET balloon dilation . Material One fifth chronic patient otitis medium effusion ( OME ) beneficial effect balloon dilation ( 2 ) . We hypothesize contrast medium pas bony part ET majority patient , majority patient experience successful relief disease balloon dilation . Variation know , presume exceed 20 % . Sample size calculation straight-forward case , handle dichotomous variable . Power calculation indicate need number 80 individual patient group power least 80 % detection difference 2 group alpha level 5 % two-sided test . Additionally , include 15 control presume healthy middle ear ET verify significantly good contrast medium passage epipharynx individual group patient chronic OME , base similar power calculation . Recruitment number undergo CT examination contrast carefully administer tympanostomy tube do clinically indicate plan CT avoid excess radiation dose additional visit hospital patient . Mb Meniere patient occasionally treat tympanostomy tube , although middle ear pathology . This patient group also routinely undergoes CT-examination temporal bone . Hence plan include 10 patient mb Meniere tympanostomy tube examine similar contrast medium CT protocol describe healthy control group . Method Out patient referred Ear , nose throat ( ENT ) -clinic OME offer part study , give qualify accord inclusion exclusion criterion . All patient give write information consensus form . At first visit , ENT- surgeon control status eardrum middle ear otomicroscopy . The extent pneumatisation / atelectasis fluid middle ear evaluate addition state position tympanic membrane . With nasal endoscope condition Rosenmullers fossa function torus tubarius examine . The latter control ask patient equalize pressure scope nasopharynx , open torus see . The patient control interview structurally symptom relate middle ear temporal bone disease . Included patient without tympanostomy tube give one day clinical examination . The patient treat nasal corticosteroid prescribe use first control . CT perform 3-4 week . At CT-lab ENT-surgeon drip 2 ml iodixanol contrast medium dilute saline ( NaCl ) 20 % tympanostomy tube patient lie / back head slightly turn opposite side . After turn head neutral position delay 10 minute CT examination conduct use 200 milliampere ( mA ) 120 kilo volt ( kV ) . Reconstructions make raw material . In addition axial coronal reconstruction , image series reconstruct oblique coronal image plane . The physicist contribute achieve best possible protocol . As example possible use different kV value keep dose parameter ( CTDIw ) level exist temporal bone protocol . By allow mAs value change , able decide optimal kV level study , without expose patient high radiation dose . The physicist also involved optimisation reconstruction image ET . The image reconstruct different filter degree iterative reconstruction . Using radiologists observer , optimal reconstruction setting Eustachian tube select . The physicist also calculate organ dos effective dose patient . All patient include study treat balloon dilation general anaesthesia , 3 - 4 week CT procedure . The ENT surgeon blind result contrast medium part CT examination . In relation hospital stay balloon dilation patient repeatedly examine interview similarly examination inclusion . Follow-up conduct 3 month 6 month balloon dilatation renew clinical examination interview , accord presently establish routine follow-up . Parameters note different time point CT finding include contrast medium passage , clinical biochemical sign inflammation and/or infection , symptom relate middle ear temporal bone disease and/or general infection , clinical result ET balloon dilation finally divide patient group responders non-responders dilation .</detailed_description>
