	<brief_summary>The Impact Ticagrelor Coronary Atherosclerotic Lipid Pool Inflammation Assessed Near-Infrared Spectroscopy study evaluate whether ticagrelor lead 20 % reduction LCBI NIRS/IVUS suggest coronary plaque stabilization reduce inflammation patient already long-term statin therapy undergo non-urgent PCI . It hypothesize treatment ticagrelor follow PCI lead significant 20 % reduction lipid pool measure NIRS/IVUS follow-up compare baseline imaging , suggest reduction inflammation stabilization lipid core atherosclerotic lesion treat index procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single-Center , open-label study effect ticagrelor reduction lipid pool 30 patient multi-vessel CAD 2 Treatment period 6 month , 2 additional follow-up phone call 1 3 month . Non-urgent PCI require stent placement evaluation NIRS/IVUS baseline 6 month follow A second concomitant coronary lesion diameter stenosis great 50 % also image use NIRS/IVUS . Patients discharge ticagrelor regiment 90 mg twice day 6 month study . Blood sample draw baseline prior ticagrelor administer follow . Inclusion Criteria : - Female ( post menopausal surgically sterile ) and/or male age 18 year old - Multi-vessel coronary artery disease - Statin therapy minimum 6 week prior enrollment study plan adjustment - Non-emergent PCI ACS stent placement require dual-antiplatelet therapy - Ability safely perform NIRS/IVUS concomitant non-culprit lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 50 % treat PCI - Willing able sign inform consent participate follow-up Exclusion Criteria : - Thienopyridine ticagrelor use last month - Need coronary artery bypass surgery surgeries follow-up period - Documented medication non-compliance - Chronic inflammatory disorder treatment anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drug - Prior current malignancy within last 5 year - Concomitant severe illness reduce life expectancy prevent follow-up cardiac catheterization - Active infection - Pregnant lactate woman - End-stage renal disease - History intracranial hemorrhage - Active pathological bleeding - Known sever hepatic impairment - Known hypersensitivity ticagrelor Study Procedures : After consent obtain non-urgent PCI require stent placement evaluation NIRS/IVUS baseline perform 6 month follow . A second concomitant coronary lesion diameter stenosis great 50 % also image use NIRS/IVUS . Patients discharge ticagrelor regiment 90 mg twice day 6 month study.Blood sample draw baseline prior ticagrelor administer follow . There 1 month phone follow , 3 month phone follow 6 month clinical follow include collect blood , repeat catheterization , repeat NIRS/IVUS procedure .</detailed_description>
