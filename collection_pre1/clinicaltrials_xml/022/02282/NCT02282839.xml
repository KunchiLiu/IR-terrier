	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy radiotherapy important therapeutic modality head neck cancer patient . Oral mucositis common comorbidity chemotherapy radiotherapy . It report 30-60 % patient underwent chemotherapy 90 % patient receive radiotherapy oral mucositis . Oral mucositis reduces quality life cancer patient therapy also cause dysphagia poor nutritional status . Severe oral mucositis may necessitate unplanned gap treatment undermine chance local control . In term management oral mucositis , maintain oral hygiene avoid infection essential manner . Topical agent sucralfate , benzydamine , antifungal drug , vitamin E treatment use laser study management oral mucositis . Previous study indicate glutamine significantly reduce incidence severity oral mucositis patient underwent chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation . However , study discuss effect glutamine impact oral mucositis head neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy . This study enroll 60 consecutive patient schedule receive radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy due head neck cancer . Basic data record along tumor related variable . Then divide randomly study group control group . The study group receive oral glutamine control group receive placebo radiotherapy . The severity oral mucositis ( WHO grade system , every week ) , pain status ( visual analogue scale , every week ) , quality life questionnaire ( , radiotherapy ) also document . The difference two group analyze .</detailed_description>
