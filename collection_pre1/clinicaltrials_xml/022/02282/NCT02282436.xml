	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Its prevalence progression COPD expect become fourth lead cause death 2030 . COPD characterize period stability intersperse acute infectious/inflammatory flare-up , also call acute exacerbation , patient deteriorate , sometimes point require immediate medical assistance . Although patient eventually recover , repeat episode exacerbation may accelerate COPD progression . Exacerbations may compromise integrity limb muscle promote loss muscle mass strength . The overall objective substudy elucidate acute COPD exacerbation may affect limb muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Focusing attention exacerbation , period aggravate systemic inflammation , reward term understand link inflammation burst muscle disease COPD . We recently acquire experimental data support role ubiquitin proteasome pathway worsen limb muscle structure function acute exacerbation , provide solid framework investigation . The overall objective proposal substantiate preliminary finding elucidate systemic inflammation acute COPD exacerbation may affect limb muscle . Ultimately , research could open new therapeutic avenue minimize systemic consequence acute exacerbation .</detailed_description>
