	<brief_title>Study Postoperative Chest Tube Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-center randomized clinical trial 6 site . Pre-operative evaluation decision surgical intervention proceed currently perform center . That , neither inclusion exclusion study affect plan care patient approach chest tube management , determine randomization among 4 method common clinical use . Each enrol patient randomize either regulated pleural pressure use Thopaz+ digital chest drainage device unregulated pleural pressure use traditional system ( multi-chambered system e.g . Pleur-Evac , Atrium-Maquet similar device routine institution ) also randomize either active suction ( -20 cm H2O ) passive drainage .</detailed_description>
