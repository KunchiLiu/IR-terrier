	<brief_summary>This study propose investigate well Bright White Light Therapy work acute inpatient rehabilitation unit people experience traumatic brain injury purpose treat sleep disruption . Participants assess base sleep efficiency , think ability , therapy participation , perception fatigue/sleepiness . In previous study dim red light effect function bright white light , choose use placebo . Each subject randomize receive 30 minute either Bright White Light Therapy Red Light Treatment morning 10 day . To measure effect treatment , investigator measure participant sleep daily use actigraph watch . This watch record movement continuously . The investigator also measure subject ' report well slept , whether fatigue present , attentive treatment . Research Hypothesis : In person TBI , prospectively compare overnight sleep cohort expose morning Bright White Light comparison group expose Red Light acute inpatient rehabilitation setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TWILIGHT Study : Effect Light Exposure During Acute Rehabilitation Sleep After TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit person moderate severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) admission intensive rehabilitation unit . Consented participant ( meet inclusion exclusion criterion ) wear actigraphy watch 2 night obtain baseline sleep pattern identification . Prior treatment , baseline measure ( detail ) obtain . Participants randomize receive either Bright White Light ( BWL ) Red Light ( RL ) treatment . Light therapy treatment give 30 minute daily morning 10 day , Actiwatch wear continuously period . At end 10 day , outcome measure obtain ( ) . The specific period treatment may affect length stay rehabilitation unit . For lengths stay le 10 day , subject receive intervention day discharge time outcome measure administer . The investigator primary outcome measure actigraphic measurement sleep efficiency . Other secondary measure participation therapy , sleepiness , attention . The investigator also evaluate anticipated device cost clinical staff burden involve utilizing light therapy exposure inpatient rehabilitation clinical setting .</detailed_description>
