	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis modify positive airway pressure ( PAP ) device OSA bad market release product term treatment efficacy , comfort patient compliance . Patients treatment pressure titrate use polysomnography ( PSG ) sleep laboratory , random order spend additional time undergo PSG use device , use device home 3 week . Data collect PSG study , device downloads , independent pressure-flow logger , custom questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Treatment Efficacy Comfort Modified Positive Airway Pressure Device Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study hold two part . The main portion study compare modify PAP device market release product include laboratory testing home test device call 'Part A ' . Additional night use PAP device PSG monitoring use gather additional observational flow data allow distortion test investigation FPH ( Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare ) SensAwake ( unique feature automatically lower pressure patient wake ) algorithm use PAP , part B . Part A After patient undergone informed consent , demographic clinical variable collect enter case report form ( CRF ) setup procedure start . The patient ask complete questionnaire regard normal therapy ( ESS ( Epworth Sleepiness Score ) , FOSQ ( Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ) , custom therapy comfort questionnaire ) , set standard PSG . The patient use prescribe mask clean water chamber breathe tube connect modified PAP device . The patient sleep device throughout night PAP titrate qualified sleep technician . Pressure titration necessary two reason : firstly , may period time since participant last titration , secondly version PAP involve use different level pressure . Pressures titrate accord AASM ( American Academy Sleep Medicine ) Clinical Guidelines Manual Titration Positive Airway Pressure Patients OSA . The participant randomize either modify PAP market release device group . They issue PAP device pressure-flow logger use home usual manner PAP therapy 3 week ( +/- 4 day ) , participant return FPH sleep laboratory participate overnight PSG study use first device . At visit participant also swap second PAP device ; home use repeat device 2 . Part B After informed consent form patient set standard PSG , sleep overnight use modify PAP device , prescribe mask , clean water chamber breathe tube . This test perform provide additional flow data development engineer . This include , limited , distortion test adjustment device parameter sleep study . Distortion test analysis impact PAP pressure change participant breathe airflow .</detailed_description>
