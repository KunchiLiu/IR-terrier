	<brief_summary>This open-label long-term safety efficacy study provide opportunity LC-FAOD patient treat UX007 3 year market approval single standardize protocol . The subject may participate study treatment program UX007/triheptanoin would consolidate one program long-term maintenance consistent safety monitoring . The study design obtain long-term safety information evaluate maintenance efficacy diverse LC-FAOD population .</brief_summary>
