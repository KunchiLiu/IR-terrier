	<brief_summary>We aim investigate high level mechanism gait disorder PD patient ambulatory record electroencephalographic ( EEG ) leg electromyographic ( EMG ) signal unconstrained walk . Independent component analysis conduct signal analysis . The connectivity among different brain region also investigate . The PD patient receive deep brain stimulation recruit study . The local field potential record sub-thalamic nuclei and/or PPN record concomitantly EEG leg EMG signal unconstrained walk PD patient assess role deep structure ambulation functional connectivity brain region walk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Electrophysiological Investigation Higher Level Neural Manifestations Freezing Gait Parkinson 's Disease Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gait disorder Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) contain several aspect include particularly slowness walk freeze gait ( FOG ) . These problem may sometimes cause fall patient culminate severe head injury bony fracture . In regard understand freeze gait parkinsonian ambulatory disorder important management patient . Previous electrophysiological study gait disorder majorly focus kinetic kinematric measurement . How high level neural structure include cerebral cortex , basal ganglion , sub-thalamic nucleus pedunculopontine nucleus involved gait process currently unknown . A recent study adopt movement related cortical potential ( MRCP ) record probe PD ambulatory disorder freeze non-freezing patient illustrated PD patient FOG lose relationship stride length movement relate potential . Since study perform constrained condition trigger MRCP guarantee freeze nature FOG patient , result reflect true manifestation gait freeze PD patient . In current proposal , perform concomitant record scalp electroencephagraphic leg electromyographic signal unconstrained walk normal subject PD without FOG . Independent component analysis ( ICA ) conduct analyze possible difference pattern among three group within FOG patient freeze non-freezing phase . In addition , cortical effective connectivity among different cortical region freeze non-freezing phase also assess . Since sub-thalamic nuclei pedunculopontine nucleus may involve ambulatory circuitry , also investigate possibility PD patient treat deep brain stimulation . The nuclear local field potential record concomitantly scalp electroencephalographic signal electromyographic signal unconstrained signal . ICA event relate de-synchronization analysis conduct understand role nuclei walk . The effective connectivity deep nuclei cortical region also assess learn functional set ambulation . The pioneer exploration high level neural manifestation walk extend spectrum conventional kinetic kinematric gait analysis peep central neural circuitry operate ambulation .</detailed_description>
