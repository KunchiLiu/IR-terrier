	<brief_summary>Progress technology make telemedicine-based solution video consultation available management treatment chronic disease like diabetes , heart failure lung insufficiency home . However , direct comparison health outcome telemedicine use video consultation versus usual outpatient treatment available . We want implement model telemedicine evaluate health indicator type 2 diabetes patient treat video consultation standard outpatient treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic illness , asthma , diabetes , heart failure , hypertension , represent significant burden disease Chronic diseases also impose huge cost health care system responsible manage well significance affect . Non-pharmacological treatment mandatory type 2 diabetes patient characterized central obesity , sedentary lifestyle , overeat ( 1 ) . Secondary failure reach treatment goal despite extensive National diabetes rehabilitation program Denmark often see ( 2 ) . Outpatient control show positive effect outpatient rehabilitation ( 3 ) reduce HbA1c , weight , blood pressure . However , patient never accomplish good diabetes regulation others regulation deteriorate time . New approach require need test motivate give feedback patient home . Telemedicine capacity achieve , diabetic nurse may optimize motivation , treatment , diet direct feedback adapt milieu patient accordance potential spouse . Good metabolic control important diabetes inevitable factor increase risk cardiovascular disease , neuropathy , nephropathy ( 4 ) . The quality life reduction work ability affect , thus , life expectancy shorten 6-8 year . Multi-factorial intervention may delay ( 5 ) . The high incidence serious implication strengthen importance achieve good metabolic control lifestyle change . Health education show reduction cardiovascular risk factor ( 6-8 ) , often disappear end intervention ( 6-8 ) . Good self-care compliance improve outcome reduces diabetes complication ( 9 ) need new tool achieve high attendance National diabetes program . Telemedicine represent novel tool educate control chronic disease . It reduce HbA1c five year trial design test video-conferencing , clinical data entry review , web-based education material , monitor chat group ( 10 ) . Home telemonitoring compare telephone call reduce HbA1c level type 2 diabetes ( 11 ) technology confer statistically significant reduction HbA1c 0.5 % apply add-on standard treatment . It use adjunctively broad telemedicine initiative adult diabetes . The large telemedicine study initiate Ministry Health England ( Whole Systems Demonstrator ) randomize 3320 patient [ 12 ] heart failure diabetes telemedicine care . It show telemedicine intervention add-on therapy result statistically significant reduction mortality 8.3 % versus 4.6 % . Similarly , show reduction number inpatient number bed day 11 % 14 % , respectively . The patient ' health-related quality life unchanged . The saving less additional cost use telemedicine overall cost 15 % per patient . This point two important factor apply telemedicine solution : First , preferably replace standard care add-on , second , base patient 's computer , tablet smartphone , reduce cost substantially . Telemedicine available 98-99 % inhabitant Denmark broadband , allow video conference home . A randomized trial technology available present . We aim implement telemedicine model set design method evaluate quality treatment well technical problem replace standard treatment . Aim : We compare clinical data telemedicine group standard care group treat medical algorithm . We want reduce barrier use home monitoring -treatment among elderly , type 2 diabetes patient Hypothesis : Treatment telemedicine standard care type 2 diabetes patient result similar clinical HbA1c , blood pressure , lipid . Materials method : Individually visit outpatient clinic plan improvement glycemic control make information study give . Individual goal treatment drug need fulfil objective agree . The patient receive information study , want participate , sign approval participation randomization perform . All medical treatment , control blood glucose , blood pressure , lipid , education execute via videotelephone telemedicine group In control group patient attend usual procedure outpatient clinic regular visit . Summary recommendation glycemic , blood pressure , lipid control participant : HbA1c 6.5-7.5 % ( 48-58 mmol/L ) , fast blood glucose 6.5-7.5 mmol/l , diurnal blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg , LDL-cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dL ( &lt; 2.5 mmol/L ) start medication elevate urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ≥30 ( μg/mg ) . The treatment algorithm lifestyle adjustment plus antidiabetic drug describe elsewhere . When goal reach within 3 week , videotelephone disconnect patient encourage continue glycemic control general practitioner . A videotelephone telemedicine group deliver serviced Danish Tele Company . The trial include type 2 diabetes patient allocate October 2011 July 2012 refer outpatient clinic general practitioner . At entry , patient screen albumin/creatinine excretion rate , blood pressure , electrocardiogram , lipid profile , diabetic food control , arteriosclerotic symptom ( angina pectoris , claudication , fatigue ) . Diurnal blood pressure measure monitor .</detailed_description>
