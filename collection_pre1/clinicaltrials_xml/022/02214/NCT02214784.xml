	<brief_summary>Stress Urinary Incontinence ( SUI ) describe uncontrolled loss urine happen physical activity run , jump lift etc carry increased pressure bladder everyday life apply simply sneeze cough . There various treatment option available - surgical operation , pelvic floor exercises/muscle train electrical stimulation . This study aim prove use Neurotech Vital device 12 week stimulate pelvic floor muscle strengthen tone improve stress urinary incontinence . We compare Neurotech Vital device alter Neurotech Vital device give stimulation treatment . There 50 % chance receiving altered device , , offer non-altered Neurotech vital device first 12 week treatment programme . Both device identical look , give different stimulation skin contact electrode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurotech Vital Device For The Treatment Of Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve wear device include wired garment around hip bottom area period 30 minute , 5 day 7 , 12 week . During treatment , electrical stimulation pass skin contact electrode ( large sticky black pad ) cause pelvic floor contract relax , without anything . This treatment painful similar workout would get relax contract pelvic floor muscle , however device produce much strong contraction . The study open female fail 6 week exercise programme diagnose Stress Urinary Incontinence . It take place hospital uro-gynaecology clinics/continence clinic across United Kingdom . The study could last 16 month . This study carry prove Neurotech Vital device effective way treat stress urinary incontinence female participants.The study look result 12 week treatment programme Neurotech Vital device compare modify Neurotech Vital device . It compare follow : 1. much urine lose standard 1 minute stress test carry baseline visit ( start treatment ) right visit 5 ( end treatment - 12 week ) . 2 . How much improvement show quality life questionnaire ( measure tick question score attach add total score questionnaire ) . This questionnaire ask question quality life affect stress urinary incontinence .</detailed_description>
