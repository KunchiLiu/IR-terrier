	<brief_title>The Effect Enhanced Rice Bran Nutritional Supplement HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound ( RBAC ) metabolic syndrome variable person live HIV ( PLWH ) . This nutritional supplement make water soluble extract rice bran partially hydrolyze action natural enzyme complex extract Shiitake mushroom . Given micronutrient may important regulate immune system metabolize glucose , investigator explore impact RBAC metabolic syndrome ( MetSyn ) variables accord National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Adult Treatment Panel III guideline ( 1 ) ( fast plasma glucose , waist circumference , high-density lipoprotein [ HDL ] cholesterol , triglyceride , blood pressure ) , secondarily additional atherogenic variable ( total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein [ LDL ] cholesterol , hip circumference , body mass index ) immune functioning ( CD4+ CD8+ ) among 40 HIV+ adult ( 18+ year age ) patient stable antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Specifically , subject participate 6-month , two-group , randomize intervention , one group ( n=20 ) take 3 gram/day RBAC group ( n=20 ) take placebo compare difference outcomes two group . The result study intended address multi-faceted physiological problem HIV+ patient test efficacy nutritional supplement intervention multiple outcome population . No substantial psychological , medical , social risk exist participant , minor discomfort associate venipuncture . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report Institutional Review Board . The component RBAC harmless without significant food allergy . No serious , untoward side effect report company consumer observe previous human study . Potential adverse effect explain participant inform consent obtain . Whole food supplement virtually different consume food , manufacture . The investigator prior study RBAC show adverse effect . If side effect occur , remedy discontinue asymptomatic , reintroduce 1/4 dosage , increase amount every 2 day , uneventful , full dosage achieve . Study staff provide additional follow-up consultation subject experience untoward side effect . Other potential risk include : 1 . Randomization . A potential risk placebo group improvement investigator outcomes interest . 2 . Data collection . The investigator foresee minimal risk associate testing , discomfort fatigue . A toxicology search component reveals unique toxicity characteristic material . As report Daiwa Health Development , manufacturer product , thousand people currently use RBAC ( trade name BRM4 PeakImmune 4 ) , Daiwa unaware significant toxicity . Daiwa apply late scientific method ensure value safety raw material . Daiwa product manufacture state-of-the-art facility , strict quality control environmental protection standard . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study , although may undergo psychological physical discomfort sometimes . The process interview assessment may cause discomfort . Discomfort fatigue may also experience complete assessment battery . Alternatives study MetSyn immune function variable include prescription medication , exercise , dietary modification , nutritional supplement . The risk medication significant , include life-threatening , risk take nutritional supplement totally understood , since regulate US Food Drug Administration . Medications nutritional supplement , part change lifestyle behavior , may also prove beneficial MetSyn variable immune system functioning , long-term use unknown consequence . The information obtain study help determine efficacy use RBAC MetSyn metabolic variable immune system function . By participate study , subject may experience improved health status . The risk participate study reasonable potential enhancement metabolic immune system function improve nutritional status .</detailed_description>
