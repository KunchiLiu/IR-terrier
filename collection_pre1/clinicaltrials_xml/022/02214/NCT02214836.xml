	<brief_title>Ultrasound Imaging Kidney Stones Lithotripsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research improve ability see kidney stone ultrasound image . Specifically , test well new stone specific processing find stone show size . Ultimately , good image improve care future patient . Patients kidney stone undergo surgery kidney stone recruit consented . We image kidney ureter stone consent subject . We place water-based gel ultrasound probe subject 's skin back , side , abdomen . We save image raw electrical signal receive probe use make image . The image use estimate location size kidney stone kidney ureter . The size location also determine x-ray ultrasound image report already subject 's medical record . And recruited subject already undergo surgery exist clinical research procedure , surgeon also measure location size stone see surgery . All measurement size location kidney stone compare test accuracy new ultrasound image processing . After examination , ask anything subject , collect information exist medical record . This information include exist image stone , size stone , location stone , number stone , type stone , treatment record . We also record weight , height , race , ethnicity . Not information may available . We use information available . This additional information use test well ultrasound exam . It also show well certain group patient , example , certain stone type body size .</detailed_description>
