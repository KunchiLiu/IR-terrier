	<brief_summary>A . Specific Aims Premature infant admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) require several hundred procedure hospitalization . Many tissue-damaging procedure ( TDPs ) know cause pain [ 1 ] . Through funding NINR , investigator find TDPs cause pain also increase marker ATP degradation oxidative stress [ 2 [ . The TDP tape removal , commonly perform procedure NICU2 . Based finding , investigator seek determine intervention relieve pain also reduce biochemical marker ATP degradation oxidative stress . The investigator first examine effect oral sucrose , commonly use intervention , give heel lance . The investigator choose heel lance predominant painful procedure NICU , show 29 different clinical trial [ 3 ] . The investigator hypothesize since oral sucrose document significantly reduce pain score , administration analgesic also decrease marker ATP degradation oxidative stress . However , investigator observe opposite effect . Although single dose oral sucrose reduce behavioral marker pain , significantly increase biochemical marker ATP degradation ( hypoxanthine , uric acid ) oxidative stress ( allantoin ) time [ 4 ] . More importantly , effect oral sucrose breakdown marker ATP enhance significantly high neonate intubate receive 30 % FiO25 . These finding lead question : If oral sucrose effectively reduce biochemical effect procedural pain , intervention group intervention decrease behavioral marker procedural pain reduce ATP utilization oxidative stress premature neonate ? For RO1 renewal , investigator propose test individual additive effect two commonly use intervention procedural pain . These intervention ( ) administration 30 % oral glucose non-nutritive sucking ( NNS ) ( b ) facilitate tuck NNS c ) administration 30 % oral glucose , facilitate tuck NNS . Administration 30 % oral glucose document decreased procedural pain score [ 6-9 ] without potential adverse effect fructose , key ingredient sucrose [ 10-11 ] . Facilitated tuck gentle position preterm infant arm legs flexed , midline position close body , either side-lying prone position [ 12 ] . Because tachycardia often accompany pain , document benefit facilitate tuck stabilization heart rate reduction motor activity ( flail ) [ 12-13 ] . Non-nutritive suck refers provision weight-appropriate pacifier [ 14 ] . The painful procedure clinically require heel lance , refers puncture newborn 's heel blood glucose use specially design lancet . Our general hypothesis commonly use clinical intervention know reduce procedural pain alter biochemical marker ATP degradation , oxidative stress cell injury . Specific Aim 1 determine whether ( ) 30 % oral glucose NNS ( b ) facilitate tuck NNS ( c ) 30 % oral glucose facilitate tuck NNS decrease procedural pain . • Pain quantify use validate pain score tool , Premature Infant Pain Profile ( PIPP ) . Individual additive effect intervention determine . Specific Aim 2 determine whether ( ) 30 % oral glucose NNS ( b ) facilitate tuck NNS ( c ) 30 % oral glucose facilitate tuck NNS decrease biochemical marker ATP degradation , oxidative stress oxidative cell injury . - Products ATP breakdown plasma—hypoxanthine ( Hx ) , xanthine ( Xa ) , uric acid ( UA ) —will measure use high performance liquid chromatography . - Oxidative stress quantify measure plasma level allantoin use mass spectrometry . - Cell injury quantify measure plasma level F2 isoprostane use liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry .</brief_summary>
