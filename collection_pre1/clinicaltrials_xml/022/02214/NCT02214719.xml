	<brief_summary>A closed loop system diabetes care utilize insulin pump , continuous glucose sense appropriate mathematical modelling guide insulin dose goal Type 1 diabetes . Yet cost associate hardware prohibitive many people diabetes health care payer . Carbohydrate counting , insulin dose correction system , basal bolus regimen without insulin pump facilitate glucose control frequent adjustment diabetes regimen necessary cornerstone successful diabetes management ; use regimen suggest health care provider visit regimen leave unchanged next visit contact success limit . A readily available user friendly program suitable smart phone tablet would widespread applicability benefit . The investigator hypothesize app link web site facilitate review glucose record acceptable people diabetes improve glucose control . Our long term goal create app advise diabetes management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Type 1 diabetes use smart phone keep detailed record blood glucose reading , carbohydrate intake , activity insulin dos share u . The investigator develop smart phone app facilitate record glucose reading , Edmonton Automated Sugar Intelligence ( EASI ) . This EASI app may use Android iPhone platform . It link web site ( Intelligent Diabetes Management-IDM ) house person 's algorithm insulin adjustment ie insulin regimen scale correction factor equation , carbohydrate ratio formula meal snack , appropriate adjustment exercise entry time glucose , carbohydrate portion consume expect activity allow derivation appropriate insulin dose . This information enter EASI program associate web site clinical staff time visit diabetes program recruitment study . Then , patient simply enter current glucose carbohydrate intake EASI allow app use prescribe algorithm arrive suggest insulin dose . It simply use smart phone do mental arithmetic paper present . Thus EASI-IDM simple clinical decision support system assist health management . The advantage information store real time IDM web site person caregiver review . Since weight , age , gender , renal function , phase menstrual cycle ambient glucose may impact glycemic control investigator also record detail . The first substudy plan - Acceptability sub study survey . The team develop EASI app link IDM web site . The investigator want study well accept patient Type 1 diabetes , whether use ongoing basis , whether lead adjust insulin regimen frequently finally improve A1c .</detailed_description>
