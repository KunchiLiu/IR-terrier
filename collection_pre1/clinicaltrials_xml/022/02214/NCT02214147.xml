	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Alisertib Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma With Varying Degrees Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call alisertib . Alisertib test ass process body participant advance solid tumor relapsed/refractory lymphoma vary degree liver function . This study also assess laboratory result safety . The study enroll approximately 48 participant . Participants assign 1 3 treatment group base status liver function : Normal hepatic function ( Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal range [ ULN ] alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] level ≤ ULN ) , moderate hepatic impairment ( Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5-3 x ULN ALT level = Any ) , severe hepatic impairment ( Total bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN ALT level = Any ) . All participant administer one 50 mg dose alisertib Day 1 , Cycle 1 . Alisertib administered Days 8 14 Cycle 1 , follow 14-day rest period . Doses administer Days 8-14 50 , 30 , 20 mg alisertib , depend hepatic function . Alisertib may continue dose Cycle 1 , Days 8-14 21-day cycle ( 7 day alisertib follow 14-day rest period ) 1 year ( approximately 16 cycle ) . This multicenter trial conduct USA . The overall time participate study 13 month unless determine investigator , agreement sponsor , participant would derive clinical benefit continue treatment beyond 12 month . Participants make 51 visit clinic include end-of-study visit 30 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
