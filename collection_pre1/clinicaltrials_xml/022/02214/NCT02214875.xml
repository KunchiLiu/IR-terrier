	<brief_summary>This study aim address research question : Will continuous quality improvement , use Break Through Series approach , increase uptake PMTCT service retention-in-care HIV-infected pregnant woman mother six 12 month postpartum ? Continuous Quality Improvement ( CQI ) health system intervention assist program systematically improve service health outcome . The Break Through Series ( BTS ) specific CQI approach short-term ( 6- 15-month ) learn system bring together teams several hospital clinic ( `` collaboratives '' ) seek improvement focus topic area common process data share review Primary Objective To assess whether retention-in-care HIV-infected woman six ( 6 ) month postpartum high health facility implement CQI-BTS approach health facility implement CQI-BTS approach . Secondary Objectives To assess whether implementation CQI-BTS initiatives health facility increase : 1 . Uptake PMTCT service HIV-infected pregnant woman ; 2 . Retention-in-care HIV-infected woman twelve ( 12 ) month postpartum ; 3 . Retention-in-care HIV-exposed baby six ( 6 ) twelve ( 12 ) month age ; 4 . Uptake pre-defined , minimum set integrate RH/PMTCT service HIV-infected woman health facility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods/ Study design/ Population/ Interventions Study Design : A cluster randomize control trial 32 public primary secondary health care facility randomize 16 intervention 16 control site . The control sit receive routine CIHP support , intervention site receive structure CQI-BTS intervention . Study sit Based pre-set site selection criterion , 32 site select total 241 eligible site support Centre Integrated Healthcare Programs ( CIHP ) , provide comprehensive HIV care treatment program . These sit high level standardize care compare Government Nigeria sit minimal standardization care . The following criterion use select health facility study ; - Facility support ANC/PMTCT service capacity provide ART 12-18 month post-partum - Onsite delivery HIV+ woman facility - Provision postpartum care follow-up HIV+ woman - ANC attendance least 2 HIV+ woman per month general hospital least 1 per month primary health care ( PHCs ) - Availability , least , two train community health extension worker - Facilities provide PMTCT service six month prior onset study Study Participants : Participants HIV-infected pregnant woman present study sit 1st booking antenatal clinic gestational age 34 week less , ART naive , accept ARV agree remain care least six month post-partum . Control Intervention arm : Individual pregnant woman mother attend facility control intervention arm receive routine care include `` test treat '' protocol i.e . day HIV test initiation triple ARVs ( option B ) HIV+ pregnant woman . Clients eligible lifelong ART base CD4 count , and/or WHO staging , continue ARVs indefinitely health , eligible continue ARV prophylaxis accord National guideline . For purpose study , antenatal client see ARV drug refill delivery accord National ANC schedule appointment . Postpartum , visit follow immunization schedule i.e . 6 week , 10 week , 14 week thereafter 2 monthly 12 month . Facilities control arm continue receive routine health system support CIHP Intervention package : CQI intervention employ rapid cycle data collection , test solution review change implement . At site Quality Improvement Team ( QIT ) establish among local staff . Local Government State level QI team also set provide oversight function health facility ' QI initiative . The BTS collaborative learn approach conduct quarterly study state central location participant intervention site . The session provide opportunity team learn adapt implement change use Plan-Do-Study-Act ( PDSA ) model . Driver diagram develop understand primary secondary driver low retention HIV positive mother formulate action plan indicator set address . Between collaborative session , specific designate improvement coach follow site team regular interval via physical site visit telephone call guide implementation change idea . Different site team also encourage communicate telephone call cross-site visit strengthen learn exchange idea . Sample size estimation : Sample size calculate use window programme epidemiologist . The CQI-BTS approach test within study would deem worthwhile 20 % absolute increase retention mother 6 month ( e.g . expect retention rate control arm : 40 % ; expect retention rate control arm : 60 % ) . First , minimum sample size need individual randomization calculate detect desirable difference proportion level significance set 95 % ( two-sided ) 80 % power . We find 94 mother-infant pair would need arm individual randomization . Second , bear mind trial randomize intervention package several cluster , sample size non-cluster randomized trial inflate Inflation Factor ( IF ) . The IF calculate follow : IF = 1 + ( - 1 ) ro , size cluster , ro internal variability represent strongly individual within cluster relate . In case , difficult estimate priori internal variability due lack primary data : possible standardized structure intervention test within trial lead relatively low cluster internal variability ; alternatively , intervention package depend individual capacity/will health-care personnel , may increase internal variability across cluster . Hence , believe reasonable assume ro value 0.10 , recommend author . We set size cluster 20 , give inflation factor 2.9 . Additionally , since research carry operational context , allow 20 % routine data incomplete maternal mortality pregnancy therefore data retention care available analysis . As conclusion , total 327 mother-infant pair need arm . There 16 cluster arm minimum number 20 HIV-infected pregnant woman per site . A total 640 pregnant HIV-infected woman recruit . Data management plan : Primary outcome data source local health register -Data collection entry occur weekly study arm research assistant . A monthly review data conduct LJM study team . In addition , process measure routinely collect assess integrity implementation CQI-BTS intervention . Primary Outcome : Proportion HIV+ pregnant woman care 6 month postpartum Source Document : PMTCT ARV register Secondary Outcome 1 : Proportion HIV+ pregnant woman initiate ARV prophylaxis treatment within 2 week enrolment Source Document : PMTCT HCT register , PMTCT ARV register Mother Child Care Form Secondary Outcome 2 : Proportion HIV+ pregnant woman care 12 month postpartum Source Document : PMTCT ARV register , Mother Child Care Form Secondary Outcome 3 : Proportion HIV expose infant Dry Blood Spot ( DBS ) sample take 8 week life Source Document : Child follow register Mother Child Care Form Analysis plan : Descriptive analysis conduct outline participant ' cluster ' baseline characteristic outcome study arm use frequency tabulation summary statistic . Bi-variate analysis do identify potential prognostic factor confound distribution baseline characteristic among arm require adjustment .</detailed_description>
