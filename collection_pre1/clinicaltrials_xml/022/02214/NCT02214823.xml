	<brief_summary>Project Summary : Patients length stay four day ICU require mechanical ventilation assistance breathe 48 hour invite participate . Participants randomise either receive Functional Electrical Stimulation ( eStimCycle ) assist cycle standard care . As cycling bed previously show improve physical function , patient receive cycle treatment one leg cycle leg cycle assistance electrical stimulation want establish effectiveness addition electrical stimulation muscle . Muscle bulk , strength physical function outcome measure measure baseline , weekly ICU , ICU discharge hospital discharge . Cognitive function also measure hospital discharge , 6- 12-month follow-up . A small group patient study invite provide sample blood , urine muscle ICU admission discharge try determine happens muscle patient critically ill . Significance Project : This important study development ICU-acquired weakness ( ICU-AW ) result long term limitation physical function . Early treatment maintain strong muscle intensive care stay may help speed recovery enhance participation rehabilitation treatment improve functional activity cognition . These important objective patient family . In addition understanding muscle become weak quickly patient ICU help develop treatment may help maintain muscle strength . Study Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation improve muscle strength hospital discharge . Hypothesis 2 : eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation improve cognitive function 6 month follow . Hypothesis 3 : Patients receive eStimCycle improve activity anabolic signal pathway less atrophy skeletal muscle fibre size compare usual care rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
