	<brief_summary>The prevalence allergic disease , especially airway allergic disease , increase dramatically last twenty year world include Lithuania . Allergic diseases associate significantly reduce quality life sometimes cause death . Allergic disease turn important economic social burden nowadays take important place health system . Despite intensive investigation , pathogenesis allergic airway disease still remain unclear . As allergic disease systemic pattern multicomponent pathogenesis , important investigate individual cell , examine various inflammatory cell instead , include biological product possible cellular interaction along course allergic disease . This research focus cell claim important pathogenesis allergic airway disease , i.e . newly find effector T helper cell subset ( Th9 cell ) , still lack deep investigation , main inflammatory cell , eosinophil . This study aim determine importance way Th9 lymphocytes perform , eosinophil 's activity , well molecular factor affect cell process prognostication allergic airway disease , namely allergic rhinitis allergic asthma . An allergen challenge test perform order define meaning pathogenetic change . The result research may reveal useful information course allergic disease may valuable create strategic principle prophylaxis . The finding could use prevention early diagnostics allergic disease could also open door discover new effective treatment .</brief_summary>
