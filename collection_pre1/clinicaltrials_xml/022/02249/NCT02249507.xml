	<brief_summary>Aerobic exercise potential diminish blood pressure value . The aim study determine whether potential also applicable resistant hypertension whether exercise intensity play role context . We hypothesize perform aerobic exercise session reduce blood pressure value resistant hypertensive patient dose-response relation exercise intensity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Postexercise Cardiovascular Responses Resistant Hypertension : Cross-over Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise prescription gathering great importance preventive health . Several organization endorse performance least 150min/wk moderate intensity 75min/wk high intensity order achieve good health parameter different context . Aerobic exercise know effective way diminish BP level post-session . These response widely applicable hypertensive subject , act aid BP management treatment . Although benefit aerobic exercise well know , study explore potential intervention resistant-to-treatment patient . Moreover , effect different intensity aerobic exercise population scarce . Thus , aim study determine magnitude BP response , , resistant hypertensive subject two different intensity aerobic exercise , compare control session . For , subject enrol one pre-intervention cardiopulmonary exercise test three randomize intervention session : control , 50 % HRmax 75 % HRmax . Prior immediately intervention session ( 1h ) , forearm blood flow reactive hyperemia assess venous occlusion plethysmography . After session , 24h blood pressure assess ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system .</detailed_description>

Muscle skeletal abnormality preclude effort , abnormal exercise stress test , major illness would preclude exercise effort could influence outcome variable ( pulmonary disease , valve disease , renal insufficiency , etc . )</criteria>
