	<brief_summary>As citizen information age , human leave digital trace behavior communication movement pattern cell phone . The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) technology track way person commute school work visit family friend . Circadian rhythmicity describe concept many bodily function follow roughly 24-hour rhythm .

	<detailed_description>Cell phone internet access ( so-called smartphones ) represent rich source user activity data . Each time one place call , send text message , use app , data trace produce overall reflect user 's social activity behavior . This data call 'social sensing data ' . Researchers connect type data health status person operate cell phone . An example outbreak seasonal flu may lead few call text message among cell phone user . Thus , social sense data may show example severe outbreak fast spreading . `` Circadian rhythmicity '' describes concept many bodily function follow roughly 24-hour rhythm . Usually , ability concentrate focused work best daytime rest sleep occur nighttime . A disturbance pattern , example regular nightshift work , may lead increase disease risk , cardiovascular system , heart blood vessel . Natural factor within body produce 24-hour rhythm . This rhythm affect outside cue sunlight . Jet lag short-term form disturb 24-hour rhythm . When person travel fast several time zone , plane example East West Coast US , s/he arrives time difference 3 hour . Upon arrival , body run still East Coast time , expose environmental cue follow West Coast time , may make person feel groggy disorient first . Within couple day body time usually adjust complaint discontinue . The current study wish look relationship pattern participant 's cell phone use ( Android point ) several bodily function . As bodily function investigator measure blood pressure breakdown product ( metabolite ) urine , blood saliva sample . The investigator collect stool sample use swabs collect microbe inhabit mouth well rectum . The investigator also measure messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) , messenger product participant 's heritable information , blood . A cell phone application call `` Ginger.io '' collect participant ' cell phone usage information . This application also ask participant several question installation , participation well end . Furthermore , investigator ask participant dietary intake habit . The aim learn 24-hour rhythm connect social activity behavior well blood pressure metabolites marker health status .</detailed_description>
