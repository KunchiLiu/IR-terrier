	<brief_summary>Twins share placenta two separate sac amniotic fluid ( monochorionic-diamniotic ) risk develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) . TTTS result anastomose placenta lead unequal sharing blood , cause abnormal blood flow twin . The donor twin may low fluid level , poor growth , anemia . The recipient twin high fluid level , high red blood cell count , heart failure , hydrops . Having TTTS , especially demise one twin disease severe enough warrant laser photocoagulation anastomotic site , put survive fetus risk brain injury due hypoxia , ischemia , reperfusion injury . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) superior ultrasound detect subtle cerebral injury . An MRI score scale develop use low birth weight infant show correlate neurodevelopmental outcome , test patient population . Our center 's guideline recommend fetal MRI prior intervention , 32 week gestational age , infant term correct gestational age . Infants treat TTTS utero see Nursery Follow-up Clinic 4 month age , 8 month age , Bayley Scales evaluation 15-18 month age 2-3 year age . The purpose study correlate brain MRI score neurodevelopmental outcome survivor TTTS either require fetal surgical intervention demise cotwin . The investigator predict severe white gray matter injury determine Woodward/Inder grade scale positively associated bad neurodevelopmental outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility MRI Scoring Predict Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Survivors Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All mother pregnancy affected twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) refer St. Louis Fetal Care Institute ( FCI ) evaluate enrollment two year period . The woman severe finding indicate need fetal intervention demise one fetus due TTTS approach FCI discus study . Once baby ( y ) is/are bear , write consent infant 's participation obtain . FCI Cardinal Glennon Children 's Medical Center establish protocol TTTS . Fetuses affect TTTS fetal MRI echocardiogram time diagnosis ( time permit intervention ) 32 week gestation . The infant receive postnatal MRI term correct gestational age ( &gt; 37 week gestation ) . This may do inpatient still hospitalize Cardinal Glennon , outpatient birth hospitalization different hospital , discharge home prior 37 week age . They also receive postnatal echocardiogram , may do birth hospitalization , time outpatient MRI appointment . All infant follow 4-6 month age physical therapy evaluation , concern , return 4 month later repeat physical therapy evaluation . Bayley Scales Infant Development ( BSID-III ) evaluation perform child psychologist 15-18 month correct age , 2-3 year age . At time process , concern developmental progress , home therapy service prescribe help improve outcomes . This protocol evaluation result total 3-5 follow-up appointment infant initial hospital discharge , standard care investigator hospital . MRI provide detailed information ultrasound diagnose hypoxic ischemic brain damage prenatally postnatally ( 1,2 ) . Ultrasound low sensitivity detect non-hemorrhagic brain injury , study show 14-27 % infant cerebral injury MRI abnormality see head ultrasound ( 3,4 ) . Studies premature infant show correlation MRI finding term correct age neurodevelopmental outcomes . A grade scale propose Woodward Inder ass degree white gray matter injury MRI ( 5-7 ) . After multivariate adjustment , scale show increase severity white matter abnormality associate increased risk severe motor delay cerebral palsy ( 5 ) . The presence white matter abnormality find sensitive identifying child neurodevelopmental impairment ultrasound finding intraventricular hemorrhage periventricular leukomalacia ( 5 ) . Furthermore , child normal mildly abnormal MRI free severe impairment 2 year age ( 5 ) . If infant high risk neurodevelopmental delay could identify earlier accurately , infant could monitor closely early intervention could administer . This would potentially result good long-term neurodevelopmental outcome high-risk child . However , currently correlative data MRI finding long-term neurodevelopmental outcome survivor TTTS .</detailed_description>
