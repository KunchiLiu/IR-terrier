	<brief_title>Efatutazone Dihydrochloride Treating Patients With Previously Treated Myxoid Liposarcoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine confirm response rate efatutazone dihydrochloride ( efatutazone ) patient advanced myxoid liposarcoma whose disease progress least one prior therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , adverse event rate efatutazone treated patient advance myxoid liposarcoma whose disease progress least one prior therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess predictive value peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) tumor expression archive patient tumor sample . II . To assess predictive value expression PPARgamma-regulated marker adipocytes differentiation . III . To assess predictive value expression PPARgamma-regulated cell cycle proteins . IV . To assess effect efatutazone treatment serum adiponectin level . OUTLINE : Patients receive efatutazone dihydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) continuously . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 2 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
