	<brief_summary>Background : Inappropriate use antibiotic one main cause increase antibiotic resistance strain . In Denmark general practice account 90 % prescribed antibiotic one common reason prescribe antibiotic suspicion urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . The use point-of-care test meant decrease uncertainty bacterial origin symptom ; however , paucity knowledge validity different diagnostic approach , thus impact proper use antibiotic . Objective : To assess diagnostic validity different diagnostic approach patient suspect urinary tract infection assess impact appropriate use antibiotic . Methods : 70 practice capital region consecutively include 15-20 patient . The inclusion criterion patient comprise : ) Suspected Urinary tract infection , b ) &gt; 18 year age , c ) patient consult office hour . Data patient GP level gather . 16 diagnostic approach compare proper use antibiotic assess two-step process . The first step decision make consultation second step decision make consultation . Sensitivity , specificity predictive value measure diagnostic approach use urine culture gold standard . The impact proper use antibiotic assess hierarchical multivariable logistic model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Tools Patients With Suspected Urinary Tract Infection Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The late report Staten Serum Institute ( SSI ) 1 show primary health care Denmark represent 90 % prescribed defined daily dose ( DDD ) antibiotic , grow consumption antibiotic run alongside increase resistance E. coli , specifically ESBL-producing E. coli ( Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producing E. coli ) . The main cause E. coli infection primary care level Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) one frequent reason consultation general practice Denmark . Interestingly , consensus yet effective diagnostic approach identify patient benefit antibiotic therapy . Currently Denmark , wide variety diagnostic approach identify primary care setting ( i.e . history taking , dipstick , microscopy , culture susceptibility test practice ) . Nonetheless , conclusive evidence yet diagnostic validity approach association appropriate prescription antibiotic ( i.e . correct decision prescribe correct choice antibiotic reflect bacterial cause resistance ) impact patient ' clinical microbiological cure . For example , study include uncomplicated UTIs show symptom alone low predictive value lead overuse antibiotics2,3 . However , Richards et al compare response antibiotic woman symptom UTI negative dipstick test result , conclude empirical antibiotic use guide symptom reasonable option4 . Furthermore , microscopy recent diagnostic tool culture perform primary care setting include late pragmatic validation studies5,6 . Phase-contrast microscopy widely use primary care Denmark , although study subject show wide variation sensitivity ( 60-100 % ) specificity ( 49-100 % ) urine microscopy predict significant bacteriuria . Besides susceptibility test primary care level do Denmark quality control performance test differs across country . MIKAP ( Danish agency charge surveillance quality microbiological test perform general practice ) supervise Danish Regions authority quality control test carry capital region . In order curb development resistance bacteria strain patient urinary tract symptom infection , need increase knowledge validity different diagnostic approach impact proper use antibiotic recovery across heterogeneous group patient seek health care primary care . Objectives The central research question answer throughout follow specific objective : 1 . To assess diagnostic validity ( i.e . sensitivity specificity , positive negative predictive value ) different diagnostic approach rule rule UTI different sub-population group general practice . 2 . To describe impact different diagnostic approach appropriateness antibiotic therapy ( i.e . decision prescribe choice antibiotic ) . 3 . To describe impact different diagnostic approach clinical microbiological cure . 4 . To measure prevalence ESBL-resistant E.coli patient urinary tract symptom general practice . Materials Methods : Design setting : Prospective observational study comparison different diagnostic approach gold standard general practice . Data Collection : Before index consultation , participate GPs ask complete background questionnaire experience , organization service access different diagnostic tool . The day index consultation , GP type ICPC code dysuria ( U01 ) frequency ( U02 ) , main motive consultation , pop-up automatically appear questionnaire anamnesis , diagnostic approach , treatment relevant decision make consultation ; questionnaire directly link DAK-E/DAMD database ( Danish General Practice database aim improve quality delivery primary medical care service ) . Afterwards , patient also ask provide urine sample send Staten 's Serum Institute ( SSI ) culture , use reference gold standard . The following 14 day index consultation , patient complete symptom diary ( attach ) . They ask rate symptom day recovery ( 7 day symptom ongoing ) 3 point scale `` nothing `` `` lot '' . After 14 day patient send control urine sample . Patients persistently positive culture follow 1and 3 month . Further information patient background regard co-morbidities , previous hospitalization , previous use antibiotic gather national register The Danish national patient register The Danish national prescription register . Biobank : 10 µl urine store follow safety hygiene procedure Staten 's Serum Institute microbiological laboratory urine sample positive ESBL-producing E. coli . After detection positive resistant strain , sample anonymized stored period 2 year completion current study . We plan carry microbiological analysis resistant bacteria collaboration expert proteonomics genomics within big UC-CARE project . The collection urine sample represent risk patient follow normal procedure general practice , mean , patient request collect random urine sample plastic cup practice facility 14 day home . Data management : All data enter database link different national register obtain detailed data background information patient level . Data screen data entry error extreme value use table , plot specific command SAS 9.03 . Variables : consider multidimensional multivariable model construct order accurately answer objective , follow variable correspond data source include : Patient level Patients ' demographic ( gender , age ) , dysuria , frequency , supra-pubic pressure , polyuria , Fever ( &gt; 38oC ) , tremble , urine offensive smell , gynecological complaint ( vaginal discharge , pruritus ) , low back pain , blood urine . Number day since first symptom start . Diagnostic test : , diagnose , treatment , severity symptom , bothersomeness , impact daily activity . Previous hospitalization within last year : diagnosis , discharge date . Consumption antibiotic within last year . GP level Number consultation office hour due dysuria and/or frequency main motive consultation , GPs ' demographic , number patient GPs ' list , point-of-care test urine examination : type point-of-care test available practice , brand technical specification test . Attendance course performance test . Statistical analysis : Data analyze use SAS 9.03 . A comparison proportion perform use chi-square test . For first two objective , result urine culture use gold standard , cut-off value &gt; =103cfu/ml , pure growth E.coli , &gt; 10 4 unusual organism mixed growth use define positive culture , calculate sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value positive predictive value diagnostic approach gold standard . Regarding third objective prescription antibiotic choice right antibiotic operationalized binary dependent variable logistic regression model , last two objective number day symptomatic microbiological cure analyze continuous dependent variable multiple linear regression model . Depending number case include one month three month follow-up microbiological cure , Poisson regression model develop . The propensity score match technic employ adjust pre-test imbalance different group treatment approach order produce unbiased estimate test effect main outcome create participant characteristic balance among group . Sample calculation Different sample size need compare proper use antibiotic 16 diagnostic profile . Due observational design study , know yet certainty distribution diagnostic profile , least two sample size aim . The first one aim see clinically relevant 10 % difference proper use antibiotic compare diagnostic profile affect decision consultation versus diagnostic profile affect decision consultation . The assumption : ) 4 diagnostic profile influence decision consultation use 60 % patient , b ) correct decision take 60 % patient group , c ) correct decision consultation take 40 % patient remain 12 diagnostic profile perform . We need 60 practice recruit 15 patient ( n=900 ) . Intra-class correlation =0.2 , α=0.05 β=0.2 . The second sample size relate detection prevalence ESBL-producing E. Coli 0 6 % patient suspect UTI primary care . Our assumption sample calculation follow : ) 60 % patient symptoms positive culture , b ) 80 % patient positive culture infect E.Coli strain . Therefore , need 1500 patient suspect UTI attend primary care detect prevalence ESBL-resistant E.coli 0 6 % 95 % confidence interval . Ethics The study represent risk patient due observational design . It mean diagnostic process treatment register do every day practice . Participation study implies patient fill diary symptom 7 day willing contact 3 day 14 day personnel practice know whether fill diary , send research unit send second sample microbiological department . Consequently , course symptoms/disease affect fact participate study . All personnel practice inform study , soon patient contact practice due symptom list inclusion criterion section , receive first information study . The first contact person ( i.e . secretary , nurse , general practitioner ) ask patient whether interested participate project aim improve management patient suspect urinary tract infection . If person interested participating study , he/she give leaflet information study . This leaflet read wait consultation . If patient question , answered consultation guarantee privacy . The patient welcome companion , case consider necessary order make well-informed thorough decision . However , due fact symptom acute non-life-threatening complaint , every day practice patient use come alone . It mean , guarantee patient make non-influenced decision , personnel instruct emphasize patient much time want think , ask question sure refusal participate project wo n't change normal diagnostic process treatment .
