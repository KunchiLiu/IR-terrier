	<detailed_description>The osteopathic philosophy applies manipulative treatment well view individual whole entity . The neuromusculoskeletal system important sustaining healthy life . The musculoskeletal system intimately connect system body voluntary involuntary nervous system . Osteopathic physician trained evaluate neuromusculoskeletal system work achieve normal body mechanic use manual manipulative medicine . Osteopathic physician use palpatory examination identify somatic dysfunction . The accepted definition Glossary Osteopathic Terminology : `` Somatic dysfunction impair altered function relate component somatic ( body framework ) system : Skeletal , arthrodial , myo-fascial structure , related vascular , lymphatic neural element '' . Physicians assess texture change , asymmetry , restriction motion , tenderness . After perform OMT , HVLA , dysfunction reassess palpatory assessment . While study show effectiveness OMT , challenge remain objectively assess somatic dysfunction . According Glossary Osteopathic Terminology , HVLA technique define `` An osteopathic technique employ rapid , therapeutic force brief duration travel short distance within anatomic range motion joint , engage restrictive barrier one plan motion elicit release restriction . It also know thrust technique '' . The goal treatment restoration physiological motion dysfunctional joint . In past , osteopathic manipulation synonymous thrust technique . This may technique taught accurately describing nature restriction provide technique treat dysfunction . Proper diagnosis joint dysfunction important spinal manipulation . However , little assessment make clinician 's ability reliably identify joint biomechanical dysfunction . Few study attempt address challenge evidence-based clinical practice . In study Degenhardt et al. , investigator look inter-observer reliability osteopathic palpatory test . While study show consensus training show improvement inter-observer reliability , many previously publish study fail show level reproducibility support use palpation evidence-based clinical practice . Najm et al . systematic review paper reason one challenge behind evaluate validity palpatory assessment due lack reference standard measuring mean . The reference standard use measure finding make palpation . In study conduct Shaw et al . able use ultrasound machine ass content validity palpatory examination well provide objective evidence effect HVLA somatic dysfunction lumbar spine . We aim adapt protocol cervical spine . The study conduct Shaw et al . control group . In study , aim control group get treatment cervical spine . The control group subject cranial vault hold generally use ass primary respiratory mechanism cranium degree participation bone general motion cranium . In experimental group , participant receive cervical HVLA key somatic dysfunction segment . Based Shaw et al . study , hypothesize ultrasound reliable instrument objectively evaluate somatic dysfunction cervical spine . Furthermore , hypothesize perform cervical HVLA , leave right articular pillar key somatic dysfunction vertebra symmetrical compare baseline . Previous study show certain effect observe HVLA manipulation . In systematic review paper Hegedus et al. , find single spinal joint mobilization , temporary neurophysiological effect approximately 5 minute less . Studies reveal neurophysiological effect spinal manual therapy cause paradigm shift away strict biomechanical model . This important neurophysiological effect include pain-related measure , change skin conductance , change skin temperature improvement range motion neural tensioning . In study perform Martinez-Segura et al. , find single cervical HVLA manipulation effective reduce neck pain rest increase active cervical range motion control mobilization procedure subject suffer mechanical neck pain . This research design hold significant importance . It potentially prove intra- inter-examiner reliability palpatory assessment . In addition , ultrasonography use reference standard evaluate somatic dysfunction . Furthermore , study enable investigator quantify palpatory assessment extent HVLA effect key somatic dysfunction cervical spine . Using ultrasound machine study hold many advantage . It relatively safe noninvasive . It enable investigator visualize cervical anatomy without radiation minimal harm participant . Using cervical goniometric device , investigator observe osteopathic technique utilize study affect active range motion . The total time participation 60 minute , change range motion baseline 1 hour follow intervention assess .</detailed_description>
