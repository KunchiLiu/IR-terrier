	<brief_summary>Critically ill infant child mechanically ventilate often give large dos opiates benzodiazepine provide analgesia-sedation . These drug significantly cause tolerance dependence , depress drive breathe , thus prolongs need mechanical ventilation associate complication . We propose IV CLON could use effectively DEX .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Clonidine Sedation Infants Children Who Are Mechanically Ventilated - Dosing Finding Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All critically ill mechanically ventilated infant child receive intravenous analgesic-sedatives often include opiate benzodiazepine ( BENZO ) . Undesirable side effect drug include respiratory depression , tolerance dependence . Alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist , dexmedetomidine ( DEX ) clonidine ( CLON ) excellent sedative-analgesics effect , cause respiratory depression opiate/BENZO spar . While efficacious provide sedation , several factor lead substantial increase use new drug DEX establish drug CLON adult , child infant . However , study guide therapy dosing infant child lack . While infant child require less opiate/BENZO therapy few day mechanical ventilation , quickly develop tolerance significant withdrawal DEX . This necessitate protracted wean DEX longer length stay pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) since DEX administer continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion . CLON , hand , long half-life formulation allow continuous intermittent IV oral administration . Dr. Gauda approve IND use epidural formulation CLON intravenously infants child . The purpose pilot study determine effective IV dose scheme CLON safely use adjunct analgesic-sedation management infant child PICU . It include total 24 infant child 4 CLON DEX expose age stratum : 0-3 , 4-6 , 7-12 month . We hypothesize IV CLON achieve optimal sedation reduce need opiate/BENZO therapy critically ill infant child would otherwise receive DEX , thus , reduce length stay PICU . Data study use inform large randomize trial directly benefit infant child Baltimore critically ill. Funds request cover cost CLON drug level investigational pharmacy .</detailed_description>
