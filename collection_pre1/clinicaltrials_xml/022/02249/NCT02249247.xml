	<criteria>A diagnosis COPD define American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) criterion . Patients relatively stable airway obstruction FEV1 ≥ 20 % ≤ 70 % predict value FEV1/ FVC ≤ 70 % screen Visit 1 . Predicted normal value base guideline standardise lung function test European Community Steel Coal ( ECSC ) patient Caucasian race predict equation patient belong Black race . Patients lung hyperinflation demonstrate thoracic gas volume box ( TGVbox ) ≥ 100 % predict value ( predict value functional residual capacity ( FRC ) measure body plethysmography ) Males female age 40 year old . Female patient childbearing potential could participate study . Female patient either : surgically sterilise hysterectomy bilateral tubal ligation , postmenopausal least two year A smoke history ten packyears ( p.y. ) . A p.y . define equivalent smoke one pack 20 cigarette per day year Patients able perform pulmonary function testing ( PFTs ) , exercise endurance test terminate due leg discomfort alone restriction disease ( e.g . claudicatio intermittens , etc . ) maintain record study period require protocol All patient sign inform consent form ( one specific study procedure , one relate DNA derive determination ) prior participation trial i.e. , prior prestudy washout usual pulmonary medication agree participate portion trial . The patient obligate participate DNA collection portion trial Clinical and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment upper low respiratory tract infection within previous four week screen period study Significant diseases COPD exclude . A significant disease define disease opinion investigator could either put patient risk participation study disease could influence result study patient 's ability participate study . Patients inflammatory disease , e.g. , Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) , osteoarthritis , autoimmune disease exclude Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology , liver function , blood chemistry urinalysis . If abnormality define disease list exclusion criterion patient exclude A recent history ( i.e. , within six month ) myocardial infarction A recent history ( i.e. , within three month ) refractory heart failure unstable arrhythmia require treatment Patients know tuberculosis A history cancer within last five year . Patients treat basal cell carcinoma cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma allow A history lifethreatening airway obstruction history cystic fibrosis Previous thoracotomy pulmonary resection . Patients history thoracotomy without pulmonary resection evaluate per exclusion criterion No . 2 A change pulmonary therapy , include rehabilitation therapy , within four week prior first screen Visit ( Visit 1 ) order control patient 's COPD A history asthma total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3 . A repeat eosinophil count conduct patient A history ( within past five year ) and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse Use investigational drug within one month six half life ( ever great ) first Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) Patients require oxygen therapy 24 hour day require oxygen exercise . Patients desaturated exercise exclude upon medical judgement investigator</criteria>
