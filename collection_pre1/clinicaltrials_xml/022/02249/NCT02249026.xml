	<brief_summary>Summary : There two publish RCTs show efficacy buprenorphine treatment NAS . However trial exclude estimate 22-47 % infant require pharmacologic treatment ; infant born mother co-dependence opiate benzodiazepine . Although concern , anticipate buprenorphine safe population . If safe , include infant large double blind , double-dummy buprenorphine clonidine vs. morphine clonidine trial . If hand , infant respiratory depression adverse event buprenorphine give , important report study caution use buprenorphine infant</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Problem : Infants bear mother take abuse opiate frequently suffer neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) birth . They often withdrawal symptom life threaten untreated . The American Academy Pediatrics recommend opioid replacement treatment symptom newborn . Buprenorphine ( BNP ) gain widespread use treatment adult opioid dependence . One reason BNP appeal safety profile comparison drug class ( opiate ) . It less respiratory depression lower level physical dependence opioids . BNP recently trialed , sublingual form , treatment newborn NAS . In two trial group , significant reduction length treatment in-patient hospital day infant treat BNP comparison infant treat morphine . In study , mother/infant pair exclude mother dual dependent opiate benzodiazepine ( BZDs ) . This insignificant population . BZDs frequently prescribe pregnancy treat anxiety panic disorder woman take methadone BNP opioid replacement therapy . BZDs also common drug abuse . It estimate 22-47 % mother whose infant diagnose NAS use BZDs opiates pregnancy . These infant protract NAS long hospitalization comparison infant expose opioid alone . There conflict report literature regard safety concomitant use BNP BZDs . In adults child combination BNP BZD prolongs respiratory depression non-drug abuser . In addition , autopsy finding six adult drug abuser link concomitant use BNP BZD analysis autopsy . On hand adult taper trial compare BNP methadone dual-dependent adult adverse event BNP group , opiate withdrawal score low adult likely complete treatment . Thus treatment NAS BNP may desirable efficacious opiate tapering protocol , imperative look specifically group infant dual exposure opioids BZDs . This single site , un-blinded observational safety study . Study participant recruit eligible participant bear Bayfront Medical Center Baby Place subsequently admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) All Children 's ' Hospital ( ACH ) treatment NAS . Data pilot safety trial use apply NIH fund conduct large randomize double-blind trial determine efficacy BNP versus morphine treatment NAS . The Research Hypothesis : BNP use safely treat NAS subgroup infant whose mother take opiate BZD week prior delivery . The Importance Research : BNP emerge `` safer '' efficient drug adult detoxification maintenance program show promise treatment neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . In recent publish trial compare BNP morphine infant NAS , length stay ( LOS ) decrease 40 % BNP group ( average 38 day morphine group 23 day BNP group ) . No major adverse effect report either treatment group . As common early trial , experimental group restrict - specifically maternal BZD use exclusion criterion . The rational give length stay know longer infant whose mother also use BZDs . However , insignificant population . It report 22-47 % opiate user co-using BZDs . At ACH , incidence infant expose class drug range 15-35 % . Before BNP become standard care important look closely group infant either caution use BNP demonstrate safety . This pilot trial design determine infant dual in-utero exposure opiates BZDs safely treat BNP .</detailed_description>
