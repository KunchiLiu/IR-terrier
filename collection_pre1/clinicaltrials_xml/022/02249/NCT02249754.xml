	<detailed_description>Design : A parallel cluster randomise control trial conduct rural central Tanzania 9 intervention 9 control village . A simple randomisation 1:1 allocation use list random number generate Microsoft Excel 2007 use randomise village either control intervention group . Generation allocation sequence randomisation cluster do statistician blind study group participate research . Recruitment collection baseline information : After cluster randomisation , sub-village leader identify infant age 6 month parent systematic door-to-door survey . Parents invite meeting nature purpose trial eligibility criterion explain . Thereafter , infant screen eligibility . Parents infant meet inclusion criterion , agree participate trial give write informed consent infant recruit . Baseline information recruit infant parent ( i.e . household 's , parent ' infant 's characteristic ) collect use structure questionnaire . Structured interviews village sub-village leader also conduct collect village information ( i.e . population , health facility , water supply , school , livelihood , resource , economic opportunity ) . Intervention : The control group receive routine health education offer monthly health staff health facility . Routine health education standard government health service child age five year . It offer mother growth monitor immunisation contact . The session usually take 10-15 minute focus general health issue include child feeding , prevention disease malaria importance immunisation . The intervention group receive nutrition education package addition routine health education . With nutrition education package , mother caregiver receive 3 session education counsel optimal infant young child feed health , child age 6 , 9 12 month . Nutrition counsellor receive train baseline session repeat 6 month . After training , nutrition counsellor conduct monthly home visit counsel support mother family . Supervisory visit conduct research team every 2 month assess counsellor ' work . Separate sensitisation meeting family health staff responsible child health conduct baseline meeting repeat 6 month . Data collection : Data collection form ( structured questionnaire , observation checklist , etc . ) pre-tested neighbouring district standardise . Interviewers administer survey national language , Kiswahili . After data collection , fill form manually check completeness consistency . To enhance blinding , precise objective study village allocation trial disclose data collector ; nutrition counsellor responsible data collection ; data collection schedule randomise . Impact evaluation data : In intervention group , data primary secondary outcome collect baseline age 9 , 12 15 month . In control group , variable collect baseline , age 12 15 month . Process evaluation data : A process evaluation document intervention implementation process 1 ) ass whether intervention activity implement plan ( i.e . fidelity ) , 2 ) evaluate extent intervention reach intend mother family ( i.e . reach ) , 3 ) determine degree target mother expose intervention component extent use intervention resource ( i.e . exposure dose receive ) , 4 ) describe set ( i.e . contextual factor , facilitator , barrier , contamination ) intervention implement may influence intervention effectiveness . In control village , process evaluation identify describe action , event context may reveal new intervention , evidence contamination factor external intervention . Process evaluation data collect two month baseline ( infant 8 months-old ) end intervention ( infant 15 months-old ) . Structured semi-structured interview , review record ( e.g . train education attendance sheet , activity log , train test score , etc ) structure observation carry mother , nutrition counsellor , health worker village leader . Monitoring : The research team visit intervention village every 2 week first 2 month intervention , thereafter visit make 2-months interval . Researchers log report activity relate delivery quality training , education , supervision sensitisation meeting use monitoring tool ( e.g . form , log , observation checklist , supervisory report ) . Nutrition counsellor document home visit workbooks . Actions event external intervention happen intervention village document event form semi-structured interview . Data analysis : Data enter Epi-data version 3.1 consistency analyse range check data value . Data analyse use STATA release 12.0 ( STATA Corporation , Texas , 2007 ) . Frequency distribution run identify outlier . Impact evaluation data compare intervention control villages use hierarchical multi-level model present cluster individual level . The method provide adjustment potential covariates confounders cluster individual level . Data analyse intention treat . The process evaluation data use inductive deductive approach analyse qualitative data use NVivo 10 Windows ( QSR International , Australia ) .</detailed_description>
