	<detailed_description>Background Worldwide , number woman pre-existing cardiovascular disease develop cardiac problem pregnancy increase , due lack evidenced-based data , provide challenge treat physician . Cardiovascular disease pregnancy complex topic woman present either pre- postpartum , due pre-existing heart disease e.g . operate unoperated congenital heart disease , valvular heart disease , chronic hypertension familial dilate cardiomyopathy . On hand , diseases directly associate pregnancy hypertensive disorder pregnancy peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM ) . Women often present symptom sign cardiovascular disease palpitation shortness breath , even directly acute heart failure . There , particular , paucity data develop country unique disease pattern presentation . Pregnancy pose physiological stress test cardiac output increase 30-50 % close term . Further haemodynamic stress occurs labour many effect pregnancy cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) persist several month delivery . Awareness different cardiovascular disease occur pregnancy postpartum receive limited attention main focus hypertension preeclampsia . The global impact elevate blood pressure ( BP ) /hypertension , general , profound , responsible death worldwide cardiovascular risk factor , include tobacco use , obesity lipid disorder ( Vos , Sliwa et al . Lancet 2012 ; Gersh &amp; Sliwa , Eur Heart J 2010 ) . Beyond high income country , 80 % worldwide CVD-related death occur low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) ( Sliwa , Stewart Circulation 2011 ; Abergunde , Mathers et al , Lancet , 2007 ) . In LMICs , morbid fatal CVD-related event typically occur young age affect woman ( commonly pregnancy ) , thereby exert profound impact family unit workforce . The recently publish Global Burden Disease Study report Years Lived Disabilities ( YLDs ) 1160 sequela 289 disease injury report prevalence CVD pre- postpartum entity . However , globally , estimate CVD , particular , hypertensive disorder pregnancy , complicate 2-8 % pregnancy contribute , major extent , maternal mortality worldwide ( Sliwa , Cardiovascular Research , press 2014 ) . Chronic hypertension prevalent 3 % woman fall pregnant US ( Seely Ecker , N Engl J Med , 2011 ) also influence prevalence acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) pregnancy . The recent confidential inquiry maternal death South Africa report 4867 death report 2 year , 14 % due hypertensive disorder , another 8.8 % due medical surgical condition ( www.hst.org/za/saving-mothers-2008-2010 . This make cardiac disease pregnancy key focus area , aim reduce morbidity mortality , South African Department Health also World Health Organization World Heart Federation . We recently carry single-centre prospective study woman present CVD pregnancy Groote Schuur Hospital , University Cape Town , South Africa ( manuscript submit ) . This study investigate appropriate referral algorithm report disease presentation ( n=226 ) outcome patient , significant disease warrant follow-up tertiary care ( n=152 ) . Of 152 woman ask come back follow-up , CDMC 122 ( 80.2 % ) present prepartum . The common diagnosis congenital heart disease , valvular heart disease , cardiomyopathy diagnosis e.g . Wolf-Parkinson-White , atrial fibrillation , arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy . Management patient complex palpitation pregnancy common due increase sympathetic tone . It important distinguish palpitation secondary benign tachycardia , sinus tachycardia , important arrhythmia , supraventricular ventricular tachyarrythmias . Supraventricular arrhythmia know increase pregnancy , presumably increase sympathetic tone . Ventricular arrhythmias secondary long QT syndrome subtypes know increase peripartum period . On hand , undiagnosed complex arrhythmia serious consequence mother fetus , include stroke death . Most CV drug contraindicate pregnancy FDA class C D classification - e.g . beta-blockers ( C &amp; D ) , soltalol ( C ) amiodarone ( D ) . The treat physician therefore need document exact nature arrhythmia-causing symptom , palpitation , dizziness syncope , prior make decision pharmacological device management . As 24-hour holters low diagnostic yield , use ECG loop recorder ( REVEAL ) could potentially influence management . Interestingly , use REVEAL XT 2 pregnant woman newly diagnose arrrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy strong family history sudden cardiac death . Sinus tachycardia present correlate symptoms palpitation . As supraventricular tachycardia detect , patient could manage conservatively good maternal fetal outcome . On hand , 2 woman present palpitation dizziness pregnancy subsequently diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis , serious condition associate sudden cardiac death . 1 . Objectives : 1.1 . To investigate use small ECG loop recorder ( REVEAL device ) pregnant woman , without structural heart disease , supra/ventricular tachyarrhythmias bradyarrythmias suspect . 2.1 . To investigate REVEAL device change management compare single 24 hour holter do presentation . Our research question base preliminary information , use REVEAL XT 2 pregnant woman newly diagnose arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy strong family history sudden cardiac death . As supraventricular sinus tachycardia detect , patient could manage conservatively good maternal fetal outcome . On hand , 2 woman present palpitation dizziness pregnancy subsequently diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis , serious condition associate sudden cardiac death . A REVEAL device use guide physician management . 2 . Patient population The patient recruit via single-centre , prospective study woman cardiovascular disease present pre- postpartum , attend Groote Schuur Hospital . Since 1 July 2010 , patient see weekly clinic , jointly run cardiologist obstetrician , leadership Prof. Karen Sliwa Prof John Anthony . We see 100 new patient present cardiovascular disease pregnancy per annum . About 200 newly diagnose pregnant woman document suspected cardiovascular disease screen indication insert REVEAL device . Those patient part ongoing registry entitle : Registry newly diagnose case cardiac disease maternity-Phase II ( CDM-2 ) . Device : The REVEAL device size large USB stick insert local anaesthetic sterile condition e.g . minor procedure room . It insert skin wire connect e.g . cardiac chamber vessel . The device record cardiac rhythm period one year . The REVEAL routinely ised South Africa 10 year . 3 . Study design treatment group A single-centre , observational outcome study investigate peripartum woman present symptom sign arrhythmia . We aim recruit 20 consecutive woman indication REVEAL , population 200 pregnant woman document suspected cardiovascular disease part ongoing cardiovascular disease pregnancy registry . Human Ethics Committee approval obtain overall prospective outcome study cardiovascular disease pregnancy ( HEC REF : 173/2010 ) Estimate study duration : 2 year Estimate study start date : June 2014 Estimate study end date : May 2016 4 . Endpoints Our prospective study answer question whether REVEAL device : 4.1 . Are acceptable diagnostic tool pregnant woman . This assessed documentation number woman present indication REVEAL insert ( base standard criterion ) number woman accept device . We see 100 new patient present cardiovascular disease pregnancy per annum . 4.2 . Detect arrhythmias pregnancy guide cardiologist obstetrician appropriate management , range assurance , medical therapy , device therapy termination pregnancy . 4.3 . Change management condition compare single ECG perform day offer insertion REVEAL device . 5 . Measurable output Publication Plan Presentation data In past decade I invite annually present research form invite lecture follow meeting : Congress Heart Failure Association ESC ; European Cardiac Society Cardiology , World Congress Cardiology , South African Heart Failure Society , Pan African Cardiac Society . The data obtain study presented meeting . Publication Original Data The data publish part overall cardiac disease pregnancy registry separate paper .</detailed_description>
