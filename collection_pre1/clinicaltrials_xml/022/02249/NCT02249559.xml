	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluating Safety Unilateral Gamma Knife Subthalamotomy Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study enroll 20 subject could benefit unilateral subthalamotomy due presence unilateral rigidity , tremor , bradykinesia and/or dyskinesia ( oppose axial symptom walk ) suboptimal candidate deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) advance age ( &gt; 74 ) , medical comorbidities preclude surgery , patient aversion DBS , show 30 % improvement Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) score ON versus OFF medication state . Secondary objective focus efficacy Gamma Knife ( GK ) subthalamotomy Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , determine change patient 's clinical status improvement follow treatment . A full neurologic exam well screen depression administer every postoperative visit . The patient 's neurologic function assess full neurological examination objectively quantify use UPDRS focus contralateral side , well overall UPDRS . The clinician complete Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) visit record overall impression patient 's disease progression severity , evaluate cognitive function . Pre- post-treatment assessment Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose ( LEDD ) ( quantification medication regimen levodopa equivalent ) obtain record evaluated efficacy gamma knife subthalamotomy ( GKS ) treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . A Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire-39 ( PDQ-39 ) determine patient 's independence quality life fill visit . Finally , patient complete Beck Depression Inventory clinic visit monitor development progression depressive symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Otherwise appropriate DBS candidate deem suboptimal DBS account one following : advanced age great 74 year age medical comorbidities need continual anticoagulation poor candidate general anesthesia base cardiac , hepatic , renal pulmonary status high infection risk internal DBS device hardware place ( ie . Poor diabetes mellitus control ) patient aversion DBS 2 . Patients asymmetric disease symptom include : rigidity tremor bradykinesia dyskinesia 3 . More 30 % improvement UPDRS score ON versus OFF medication state , except : presence disable contralateral dyskinesias/dystonia limit dose tolerance tremor medically refractory 4 . Patients stable medication regimen demonstrate stable disease symptom ( absence significant improvement deterioration ) least 3 month time GKS , determine review medical record 5 . MMSE score great equal 26 Patients prominent axial symptom include postural instability gait disturbance , define score 3 great Questions 28 , 29 &amp; 30 UPDRS Patients whose symptom improve 30 % UPDRS score medication , unless patient experience doselimiting side effect The presence dementia inability provide inform consent participation study , determine minimental status examination score 25 Patients prior brain radiation Patients improvement satisfactory symptom management offer procedure . We include patient without satisfactory symptom management .</criteria>
