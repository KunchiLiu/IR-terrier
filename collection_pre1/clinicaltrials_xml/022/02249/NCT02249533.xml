	<brief_title>Evaluation Spot Light : A Concussion Injury Management App Youth Sports</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sports-related traumatic brain injury ( TBIs ) , include mTBIs - commonly refer concussion - serious public health concern . During last decade , emergency department visit sport recreation relate TBIs among youth , include concussion , increase 62 % . [ 1 ] Concussion rate among high school athlete significantly increase past decade . [ 2 ] Although sports-related concussion mild injury athlete fully recovers symptom within week , [ 3-5 ] year TBIs contribute substantial number death case permanent disability . While contact sport football high incidence rate concussion , injury occur across wide range sport . [ 5 ] Diagnostic criterion consensus return play ( RTP ) guideline exist , clinician vary approach diagnosis management sports-related concussion guideline almost completely unsupported evidence base . Increasing awareness concussion sign symptom , improve sport specific coach technique , promote good sportsmanship , provide appropriate protective equipment respond quickly injury reduce incidence , severity long-term negative health effect sport related concussion among child adolescent . [ 1 ] Thus critical need development tool prevention . Our long-term goal reduce negative consequence sports-related concussion , specifically youth sport . The overall objective application , first step toward attainment long-term goal , evaluate effectiveness Spot Light ( concussion injury management application [ app ] organize coordinate diagnosis , management , RTP procedures injury safe return sport ) ( Appendix 1 ) utilize middle high school football team . Our central hypothesis middle high school football team randomize receive Spot Light report increase rate concussion ; increase referral physician care , increase athlete compliance RTP guideline . The rationale underlies propose research provide easy-to-use app sports-related concussion high probability effectively help people involve youth sport well recognize , respond , ensure athlete fully recover sports-related concussion . We plan test central hypothesis , thereby , attain objective application pursue follow specific aim : Aim 1 . Evaluate whether Spot Light increase report rate sports-related concussion . Working Hypothesis—teams use Spot Light report high rate concussion team without Spot Light . Aim 2 . Evaluate whether Spot Light increase referral physician patient care follow sports-related concussion . Working Hypothesis—teams use Spot Light refer concussed athlete treatment physician team without Spot Light . Aim 3 . Evaluate whether Spot Light improve management sports-related concussion . Working Hypothesis—injured athlete team utilize Spot Light exhibit high compliance RTP guideline , team without Spot Light . It anticipate aims yield follow expect outcome . We expect determine whether increased reporting concussion , referral physician , athlete compliance RTP guideline . We also expect learn whether app adopt utilized similarly distribute different level youth sport ( middle vs. high school age ) different type `` reporter '' ( coach vs. certify athletic trainer ) . We expect widespread effectiveness across age group type reporter ; result would suggest Spot Light suitable widespread distribution across variety youth sport setting . These outcome expect important positive impact timely proper diagnosis , management , coordination care RTP decision ultimately reduce negative consequence impact sports-related concussion , detail next section .</detailed_description>
