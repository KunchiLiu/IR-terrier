	<brief_summary>There evidence association diabetic microangiopathy elevate serum concentration advance glycation end-products ( AGEs ) . AGEs level associate ingestion specific food ( baked meat milk powder ) ; reduce dietary intake lower AGEs concentration , beneficial metabolic effect ; however threre still evidence whether impact microvascular complication DM . We recently apply funding compare RCT effect Cholestyramine versus placebo , visual electrophysiology . This drug similar Sevelamer structure , act chelators bile salt , reduce absorption dietary AGE , lower serum level . However essential carry preliminary test assess aspect may imply adjustment propose protocol , : 1 ) tolerance drug 2 ) short term effect drug versus placebo serum level AGEs 3 ) effect drug versus placebo level fat soluble vitamin ( D K specifically ) 4 ) intra interindividual variability electrophysiological measurement vision ( ERGMF optic nerve conduction velocity ) 5 ) drug versus placebo electrophysiological measurement vision ( neuroconduction ERGMF optic nerve ) . Objective : The present project plan pilot study , clarify point 1 5 . Methodology : patient ( 6 DM2 , 25 -50 ) assess anthropometry , clinical laboratory test ( creatinine , chemistry profile , lipid profile , microalbuminuria glycosylated hemoglobin , vitamin B12 , 25OH vitamin D prothrombin ) , dietary recall specifically design analyze regular consumption AGEs , serum CML neuro-ophthalmological study ( fundus , ERGMF optic nerve conduction ) . Subsequently patient assign treatment placebo 3 month Cholestyramine 6 g / day 12 week end period reassess use methodology . If patient tolerate drug , assign reduced AGE diet . Expected result : Cholestyramine side effect similar placebo ( mainly digestive ) . The active drug placebo reduce serum level AGEs electrophysiological parameter vision 12 week . It expect low AGEs diet patient tolerate drug also reduce serum CML although less degree also induce electrophysiologic change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients : 6 adult type 2diabetes select , age 25 50 year , 5 less 10 year disease , adherent treatment oral hypoglycemic agent insulin , agree participate study write informed consent . Only high habitual intake AGEs accord food recall include . Patients follow characteristic exclude : -Severe Obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 kg / m2 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 9 % , anemia , renal failure ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg / dL calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml / min ) , fast plasma glucose &gt; 250 mg / dL history acute hyperglycemic complication require hospitalization past 2 year , severe diabetic dyslipidemia ( LDL &gt; 130 , TG &gt; 350 mg / dL ) vitamin B12 deficiency , history heart , liver , lung cancer chronic disease , clinical diagnosis diabetic neuropathy eye condition could hinder electroretinogram , uncorrected refractive defect , cataract severe diabetic retinopathy macular edema . Other exclusion criterion poorly control hypertension acute vascular event past 2 year pregnancy . After sign informed consent , patient undergo follow assessment : 1 ) History drug registration . 2 ) dietary survey include method food preparation , consumption dietary product contain fructose corn starch specific food rich AGEs accord measurement make Chilean food ( milk concentrate powder , biscuit , cheese also specifically record , roast meat grill sausage etc. ) . 3 ) anthropometry ( weight , height , waist circumference ) 4 ) fasting basic laboratory test fast ( hemoglobin , TSH , glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , creatinine , prothrombin , lipid profile serum level vitamin B12 vitamin D ) , use automated clinical laboratory technique . 5 ) morning urine determination microalbuminuria ( MAU / creatinine ) 6 ) Inflammatory marker ( ultrasensitive PCR ) use commercial ELISA kit . 7 ) Concentration serum AGEs ( CML Abcam ELISA Antibody ) 8 ) Visual evoke potential indicator electrophysiological conduction visual stimulation optic nerve ( ON ) explore visual pathway ( myelin ) occipital cortex . 9 ) ophtalmologic examination biomicroscopy evaluation refractive defect fundus ( diagnose presence absence retinopathy ) evoke potential multifocal electroretinography . This series evaluation repeat treatment period 12 week , ie 3 occasion . Indications reinforcement traditional dietary measure improve glycemic control ( restriction caloric intake accord body composition , decrease intake simple carbohydrate increase soluble insoluble fiber reduce glycemic load ) , accord standard diabetes management Ministry Health . Also necessary hypoglycemic insulin therapy adjust order achieve adequate metabolic control ( HbA1c &lt; 7 % ) . For specific drug treatment , initially inert placebo ( talc ) capsuleswill prescribe 12 week switch Cholestyramine 12 week , equal physical characteristic capsule , initial evaluation repeat . Cholestyramine treatment prescribe use 6 g daily dose ( 4 tablet daily 500 mg cholestyramine main meal ) . Patients manifest adverse effect use active drug maintain treatment , assign dietary treatment reduce AGE diet accord recommendation Uribarri et . al . ( 32 ) 12 week , end initial evaluation repeat . In period supplementation vitamin D dose adjust pre-intervention , vitamin A E adequate dos meet DRI level vitamin K need prescribe . Patients monitor monthly treat diabetologist , verify compliance , register adverse event , anthropometric measurement fast blood glucose . If elevate blood glucose level detect infectious cause failure adhere dietary indication discard corrective measure initiate . In patient meet inclusion criterion due vitamin B12 deficiency , intramuscular supplementation indicate referred respective center . If vitamin D deficiency detect , proper supplementation enter study indicate . At end control period ( placebo 12 week ) , initial assessment repeat second treatment ( cholestyramine 6 g / day ) assign , repeat assessment end 3 month . Blood sample determination CML ultrasensitive PCR remain frozen -70 degree process end study , avoid make technical change 2 time . Instead determination make clinical laboratory ( TSH , prothrombin , glycemia , lipid profile , creatinine , glycated hemoglobin , microalbuminuria level vitamins B12 D ) , process immediately , deliver copy result patient facilitate corrective measure necessary . Primary endpoint sample size : For pilot study sample size estimate one objectives assess variability detect whether short period treatment induce change electrophysiological variable clearly detectable , addition assess drug tolerance . With information well estimate sample size randomize control large . In addition felt necessary begin study use placebo treatment assign randomly washout period would necessary randomize crossover study random type unknown . The propose ( 6 patient ) sample size calculate base available budget . It important note analysis evoke potential electroretinography considers eye separately , 12 eye 6 patient .</detailed_description>
