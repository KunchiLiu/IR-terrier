	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylorus infection show associate development gastric cancer peptic ulcer disease . Eradication H. pylorus infection could reduce occurrence recurrence disease . The triple treatment include proton pump inhibitor , clarithromycin , amoxicillin metronidazole treat H pylori infection , propose first Maastricht conference become universal since consensus conference guideline around world recommend . However , eradication rate clarithromycin-based triple therapy decline recent year , probably related increase resistant rate clarithromycin . It estimate 15-20 % patient would fail first line standard eradication therapy need second line rescue therapy . Measures improve H. pylori eradication rate include ( 1 ) increase treatment duration , ( 2 ) add antibiotic use antibiotic previously use , ( 3 ) introduce new therapeutic agent , ( 4 ) potent acid inhibition . Our group show 10- 14-day sequential therapy , consist proton-pump inhibitor amoxicillin first 5 7 day , follow proton-pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin metronidazole ( tinidazole ) another 5 7days , provide good eradication first line H. pylorus eradication . However , complexity sequential therapy complex adverse effect result add one antibiotic may poor effect compliance lead treatment failure . A simplified regimen H. pylori infection worthy investigation . Introducing new therapeutic agent The H. pylorus persistence human infection resistance drug commonly use antimicrobial therapy attribute genetic variability , also ability H. pylori form biofilm strategy overcome environmental stress protect . A biofilm dense aggregation microbial cell bound together slimy extracellular matrix polysaccharide protein . When bacteria group together multicellular community , able tolerate antimicrobial challenge normally eradicate free-floating individual cell . It currently accept biofilms implicate 80 % chronic infection cause bacteria , include middle ear otitis , endocarditis , urinary tract infection lung infection patient cystic fibrosis . The importance biofilm medicine due role persistence infection biofilm remove bacteria biofilms 1000 resistant antibiotic host defense compare free living bacteria . Several recent report indicate H. pylorus form biofilm either vitro vivo , Cole et al studied ability 19 H. pylorus clinical isolates reference strain Brain Heart Infusion broth supplement 0.1 % β-cyclodextrin . Both strain able form biofilm biofilm produce similar progression compare biofilm form bacterial specie . The first evidence vivo biofilm formation arose 2006 . The author compare , scan electron microscopy , gastric biopsy urease positive negative patient , detect presence dense mature biofilm pathogen positive biopsy biofilm absent urease negative biopsy , indicative H. pylorus able form biofilm human gastric mucosa . To context , notable stress condition stimulate H. pylori enter coccoid form antibiotic concentration reduces , resuscitate repopulate biofilm infection relapse . In vitro study , H. pylorus biofilm formation decrease susceptibility clarithromycin H. pylorus clarithromycin resistance mutation frequently generate biofilms planktonic cell . Because antibacterial susceptibility particular strain favor biofilm destabilize , believe combination antimicrobial agent anti-biofilm molecule synergistic . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) mucolytic agent thiol-containing antioxidant agent successfully use medical practice treatment patient chronic respiratory tract infection . The NAC positive effect think due mucus-dissolving property , also , interestingly , capability reduce prevent biofilm formation . NAC able avoid biofilm formation destabilize already form biofilm concentration 10 mg/mL , similar result observe pathogen . On hand , vivo study two group 20 individual , one group ( treat ) receive N-acetyl-cysteine one week anti-H. pylorus treatment refractory H. pylori infection group ( untreated control ) receive destabilizing agent , show eradication infection 65 % case N-acetyl-cysteine treat group detect urea breath test . The control group show 20 % successful eradication , suggest N-acetyl-cysteine act biofilm destabilize agent favor vivo activity antibiotic substance . Potent acid inhibition Acid inhibition also proven important component eradication therapy . The antibiotic , particularly clarithromycin , use H. pylorus , subject pH-dependent degradation . This degradation reduce increase gastric pH . Achieving pH 4 maximizes efficacy antibiotic . Second , proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) may alter transport antibiotic plasma gastric juice mucosa alter pH affect active transport process . The minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) antibiotic H. pylori often low high pHs . Finally , H. pylorus sensitive change gastric pH , PPI-induced elevation pH , gastric content may become less hospitable H. pylorus . The importance achieve adequate acid inhibition highlight recent study . First , increase PPI dose find raise cure rate use dual anti-Helicobacter pylorus therapy . Second , previous meta-analysis group show triple therapy use standard dose PPI twice day achieve high cure rate antibiotic plus PPI daily . Previous meta-analyses show H. pylorus treatment achieves low cure rate extensive metabolizers poor PPI metabolizers . All evidence support hypothesis achieve potent acid inhibition improve cure rate H. pylorus treatment . Lansoprazole , proton pump inhibitor specifically inhibit H+K+-ATPase gastric parietal cell , effectively inhibit basal- gastric-stimulated acid secretion . Our study prove lansoprazole-based H. pylorus eradication achieve high successful rate . Dexlansoprazole modify release ( MR ) , new generation proton pump inhibitor , novel modify release formulation dexlansoprazole , enantiomer lansoprazole . Dexlansoprazole MR employ innovative Dual Delayed Release ( DDR ) technology design prolong plasma concentration-time profile dexlansoprazole extend duration acid suppression . In phase 1 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study Dexlansoprazole MR 60 90 mg daily also produce significant increase percentage time intragastric pH &gt; 4 24-h postdose compare lansoprazole 30 mg daily ( ∼70 % dexlansoprazole MR vs. 60 % lansoprazole , P &lt; 0.05 ) . Since acid inhibition crucial H. pylorus treatment . Whether potent PPI , Dexlansoprazole MR could improve efficacy H. pylorus treatment investigate . Therefore , primary purpose propose study compare efficacy dexlansoprazole MR base triple therapy without N-acetyl cysteine helicobacter pylorus eradication</detailed_description>
