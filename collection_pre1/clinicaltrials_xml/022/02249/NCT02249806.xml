	<detailed_description>PH serious disease dismal prognosis impair quality life leave untreated . Advances medical therapy improve survival accord recent registry , associate high healthcare cost . Most treatment trial clinical follow-up assessment rely 6 minute walk distance main outcome parameter although submaximal exercise performance reflect one disease aspect . Reliable patient center prognostically relevant outcome measure highly warrant field PH . With prospective cohort study investigator intend gain important information course disease knowledge value different new already establish outcome parameter . New outcome assess home base activity monitoring , novel physiological measure , namely cerebral muscle tissue oxygenation rest exercise testing , stair ascent mechanograph , sit stand test several serum marker micro-RNA . All assessment compare hard endpoint event ( death , lung-transplantation , hospitalization PH ) , traditional outcome measure NYHA functional class , 6 minute walk distance , generic quality life , cardiopulmonary exercise test , sleep study , health preference ( utility ) cognitive function .</detailed_description>
