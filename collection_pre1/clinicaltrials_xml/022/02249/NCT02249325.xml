	<brief_summary>This pilot quasi experiment design determine feasibility randomize control trial oral probiotic combination Florajen3 ( &gt; 7.5 x109 L. acidophilus , &gt; 6.0 x109 . B. lactis , &gt; 1.5 x109 B. longum ) take orally daily begin 28 week gestation , placebo , reduce colonization group B Streptococcus 36 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods A non-blinded , open-label , quasi-experimental design approve Institutional Review Boards three institution ( two university clinical research site ) . The study set large Certified Nurse-Midwife ( subsequently refer midwife ) clinical practice serve culturally economically diverse urban population Midwest region USA . Participants Women self-selected participate screening informed consent procedure do first two author . The following inclusion criterion use study enrollment : low risk ( obstetric , fetal , medical genetic risk factor ) , adult ( ≥18 year age ) , pregnant 28 ± 2 week gestation , able speak write English , express willingness participate study intervention ( oral probiotic ) data collection ( vaginal rectal swab , questionnaire ) . A convenience sample 20 healthy pregnant participant seek . Following informed consent , first 10 subject assigned experimental group . Nonrandom assignment use assure 10 experimental group participant enrol remain within funding , time constraint . After enrol experimental group , next ten woman assign control group . Intervention The study intervention consist one capsule Florajen3 ( previously describe ) orally day . Florajen3 meet internationally establish probiotic criterion ( FAO/WHO , 2001 ) . The probiotic contain Florajen3 non-spore-forming , lactose- hydrogen-peroxide-producing bacteria . The manufacturer recommend refrigeration maintain maximum potency . As part preparation study , sample Florajen3 leave unrefrigerated period 6 week appropriate colony count sustain . Therefore purpose study , participant experimental group allow leave probiotic unrefrigerated effort improve daily compliance . Experimental group study participant make aware probiotic brand use ( open label ) intervention . Further , current state knowledge prenatal probiotic , include potentially rare side effect , discuss length use 10-page informed consent document . The Florajen3 place study bottle equip electronic cap monitoring system ( MEMS ®AARDEX ) , design record time bottle open participant . Each opening cap bottle equip system record microchip . The number opening retrievable via computer software bottle cap return . Researchers , midwife , participant aware group assignment . The control group participant receive placebo . Procedures Midwife prenatal care provider staff orient study data collection procedure . Study data collect three point routine prenatal visit participant 's midwife ( 28±2 week , 32±2 week , 36±2 week gestation ) . The study consider complete 36±2 week gestation visit . All participant receive compensation completion 2 study visit ; 25 USD 32±2 week 75 USD 36±2 week gestation . Probiotic group participant offer supply probiotic remainder pregnancy . The midwife prenatal provider collect demographic information ( birth date , race , gestational age ) , vaginal rectal swab GBS wet mount , use accept criterion identify vaginal pH presence normal flora and/or pathogen . The wet mount examine microscopically midwife use standardized wet mount diagnostic procedure normal saline potassium hydroxide document standard format . Participants complete brief questionnaire study visit ask describe yogurt ingestion , sexual activity ( frequency type ) , vaginal cleansing practice ( use ) past week ; consider potential confounding variable . The participant also ask practice typical , , atypical . Women experimental group ask report side effect attribute probiotic notify midwife immediately , necessary , also note information study questionnaire . As part routine prenatal care , CDC-required GBS vaginal rectal swab collect participant 's midwife send hospital laboratory 35 37 week visit . This result determine need IAP . Researchers oversee data collection sample packaging . Participants ask return probiotic bottle study visit Florajen3 capsule replace fresh supply . This give researcher opportunity notify laboratory record date late evaluation electronic cap monitoring result conduct pill count additional mean monitor woman 's response study participation , well probiotic adherence study visit . The vaginal rectal swab place ice , package accord accepted procedure human specimen handle , ship overnight laboratory final author , locate 80 mile study site , process analysis . Laboratory Analysis Upon receipt laboratory , vaginal rectal swab process quantitative colony count GBS . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform determine whether bacteria isolate Florajen3 . If positive PCR , pulse field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) would perform confirm strain identity . These result research purpose available practice midwife . The routine CDC-recommended prenatal GBS vaginal rectal swab analyze hospital laboratory , use culture base method threshold GBS positive result consider great 102 colony form unit ( CFU ) per swab . These result determine need IAP available midwife management labor . Statistical Analysis Demographics , study variable , laboratory data enter analyzed statistical software package . Descriptive statistic , Confidence Intervals , Chi-squares , T-tests , correlation use analysis . Data compare subject study visit group data collection point . The qualitative prenatal GBS culture result ( positive negative ) hospital laboratory compare quantitative vaginal rectal GBS study result , adherence data , confound variable ( yogurt ingestion , sexual activity , vaginal cleansing practice ) .</detailed_description>
