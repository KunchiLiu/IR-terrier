	<brief_summary>Several employer US introduce program employee receive financial incentive receive low cost care . Under `` Rewards '' program , patient free choose provider visit pre-determined low-cost laboratory radiology facility ( call `` reward provider '' ) , receive financial incentive . The financial incentive typically form Health Savings Account ( HSA ) contribution . The dollar amount varies employer . This study use medical claim data examine program lead increase volume service perform low-cost provider decrease health care spending .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational study use Differences Differences Regression Discontinuity design . In design analytic method observation study , consider two key potential source bias . First , reward provider might differ non-rewards provider observe unobserved way quality convenience . This might confound true effect reward program service volume . That , analysis reward program simply compare service volume reward non-rewards provider launch reward program capture effect reward program well effect difference reward non-rewards provider . Second , service volume reward program might change due factor coincident launch reward program . Our proposed statistical method attempt address source confound . We examine data series way test robustness finding . Difference-in-differences ( DD ) linear regression We use difference-in-differences regression examine within-employer change provider utilization follow implementation reward program . In first set regression use data employer implemented reward program . These regression compare change provider volume follow launch reward program reward provider ( first difference ) change service volume non-rewards provider time period . We hypothesize reward provider experience great increase volume non-rewards provider . This analysis use non-rewards provider employer control group assume reward provider would experience change volume non-reward provider absence reward program . In another set regression use data employer launch reward program employer launch reward program . This analysis feasible provider unique id across employer see patient reward non-rewards employer . These regression compare change provider volume reward provider come reward employer ( first difference ) change service volume reward provider come non-reward employer time period . We hypothesize reward provider experience great increase volume come reward employer non-rewards employer . This analysis use non-reward employer control group assume reward provider would experience similar increase service volume reward non-rewards employer absence reward program . This analysis help address potential bias reward provider increase volume factor quality convenience . Regression discontinuity regression Our second study design regression discontinuity design . Providers designate reward provider base relative cost within geographic market . Providers rank base index price provider pre-specified rank threshold index designate reward provider . The regression discontinuity model compare change volumes provider threshold provider threshold . Instrumental Variables Analysis Our third study design use instrumental variable analysis . The dollar amount financial incentive varies employer introduce program . In analysis exploit difference . We assess whether effect reward service volume vary size nature reward . Independent variable As independent variable , use employer , month , year , geography , year X geography , provider fix effect . If change employee population introduction Rewards program , control difference .</detailed_description>
