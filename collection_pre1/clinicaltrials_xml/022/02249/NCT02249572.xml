	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare outcome patient vestibular schwannomas two group randomise either radiosurgery expectation . The optimal treatment small vestibular schwannoma matter controversy class 1 study investigate . Even natural tumor growth rate remain controversial report near 100 % case show growth 40-60 % various report . The clinical result various treatment strategy document , comparative study . Immediate radiosurgery wait-and scan subsequent treatment upon growth two strategy use many different center . There two study compare treatment modality .These study indicate significant effect GKRS reduce tumor growth , less difference hear complaint outcome . None study blind randomise , allow bias . The present study aim compare two modality . To achieve , intend randomise patient newly diagnose VS either Wait-and Scan immediate radiosurgery . The primary study endpoint relative tumor size measure ratio tumor volume four year compare volume inclusion . Secondary endpoint include symptom sign development measure clinical examination patient 's response standardise validated questionnaire . In addition , health economics involve strategy evaluate compare , well patient 's work status . Patients ask participate VS diagnose within last six month , age 18 70 , pending exclusion criterion ( see ) . A power analysis indicate 50 patient per group sufficient . In case failure recruit patient , change design study base patient 's choice treatment . The study announce accord international guideline . A steering committee monitor study intermediate analysis perform study group follow two year . If effect aim already observe , study nonetheless continue , early evaluate result short time course . It also discuss follow-up patient ten year inclusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vestibular Schwannoma - Radiosurgery Expectation : V-REX .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design purpose : Design : Randomised study blind observer primary endpoint ( tumor volume ) . Intention-to-treat , ie patient cross conservative GKRS group study period assign original group . Patients refrain radiosurgery despite randomisation assign radiosurgery group . Purpose : compare treatment small medium-sized VS treat standardise dose 12 Gy tumor periphery expectative treatment . Primary endpoint : Growth measure volume ratio V4years/Vbaseline 1/volume double time , evaluate T1 contrast MRI volumetry one , two , three four year . Secondary endpoint : Hearing acuity accord Gardner Robertson scale four year ( safety endpoint ) . Conversion treatment study period Adverse effect Subjective complaint assess questionnaire : Penn Vestibular Schwannoma QOL Scale EQ-50 Scale Investigations : Prior inclusion : MRI le 6 month show VS. After inclusion 1,2 3,4 year , study site : MRI inner ear ( acoustic neuroma protocol ) Balance platform Nystagmometry Audiometry Effect registration : Main variable : Tumor volume , measure T1 contrast MRI scan 2mm slice interval/thickness . For study , measurement do blind observer . Economy . Costs associate study finance research donation Helse-Vest The National Center Vestibular Schwannomas . Radiology : Image base tumor volume As primary endpoint relative tumor size , accurate measure tumor volume change thereof , mandatory . This obtain use state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) system suit acquire high resolution ( 1mm3 ) , three dimensional ( 3D ) anatomical image . A 1.5T imaging system meet require field homogeneity use imaging . The image contrast T1 weight gadolinium base contrast agent , yet T2 weight image volume also include ( preferably also acquire 3D ) . An identical imaging protocol acquire time point ( prior randomization , site follow , 4-year annual follow ) , image slice position accord anatomical landmark patient minimize variability across time . All 3D acquisition perform sagittal slice minimize artifact , also reformatted coronal axial view ( 1mm slice thickness , gap slice ) scanner system . The subsequent imaging processing , i.e . estimation tumor volume longitudinal change thereof , perform use available software time analysis . Study schedule Clinical examination , MRI , Questionnaires , Audiometry , Vestibular test do baseline annually 4 year . Patients randomise radiosurgery treat within 3 month baseline .</detailed_description>
