	<detailed_description>Study Design This study establish MTD TSB-9-W1 mCRC patient traditional 3+3 dose escalation method . Study Structure A dose escalation scenario design determine MTD accord DLT . Dose escalation scale : The dose level investigation product plan administer determine MTD DLT . Dose escalation scenario : Patients enrol cohort 3 patient dose level . Dose escalation proceed sequentially low dose cohort . No intra-subject dose escalation allow . Each patient 's first dose least 3-day apart next patient 's first dose . DLT ( except diarrhea ) determine ( NCI-CTCAE ) version 4.03 ( 2010/6/14 ) define treatment related toxicity ≥ grade 3 worsen baseline . Any grade ≥ 3 toxicity ( except diarrhea ) consider DLT unless clear alternative explanation attribution adverse event . Diarrhea event consider DLT episode NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 event last &gt; 3 day despite appropriate supportive care Grade 4 event . Diarrhea event reach Grade 4 trigger patient withdraw study . AEs evaluate accord NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 determined investigator least possibly related causality IP administration . DLT observe first 6-treatment cycle ( 1 cycle = 5 day ) . If none first 3 patient experience DLT , dose escalation proceed next cohort patient unless present dose level level 5 ( 1000 mg/day ) . If 1 3 patient develops DLT , cohort expand 6 patient ( another 3 patient add subsequently ) . If 1 6 patient experience DLT , escalation next dose level proceed unless present dose level level 5 . If 1 patient develops DLT dose cohort , dose escalation withhold prior dose level consider MTD unless present dose level level 1 ( 200 mg/day ) . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meeting hold review safety data prior dose escalation Cut-off criterion Enrolled patient treated disease progression . This study end either condition confirm . 1 . All patient Disease Progression ( PD ) death loss follow . 2 . Last treated patient receive 9-month treatment . Duration Treatment TSB-9-W1 5-day treatment cycle disease progression study cut-off . Compensation/reward information There Compensation/reward subject attend study . Results Primary Endpoint : MTD DLTs DCR assess RECIST 1.1 .</detailed_description>
