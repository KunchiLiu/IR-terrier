	<detailed_description>Pulmonary Hypertension ( PH ) syndrome characterize vasoconstriction abnormal growth function endothelial smooth muscle cell component within pulmonary vessel , lead elevation pulmonary artery pressure . PH may idiopathic ( primary ) without know cause . Some case PH familial . PH may also secondary specific disease process portal hypertension , congenital heart disease , chronic lung disease , thromboembolic disease , connective tissue disease , HIV , use anorexigens . Left untreated , PH often progressive fatal . There cure PH . Therapy focus upon treatment secondary cause present , reduction pulmonary artery pressure medical therapy . There many new development within past year management patient PH . While cure PH early detection treatment important survival patient . Limited data available describes etiology , clinical course prognosis pediatric pulmonary hypertension . Objectives Aim 1 : Clinical Research 1 . To provide mechanism store information newborn , infant child PH ; 2 . To determine incidence natural history various etiology pediatric PH ; 3 . To define investigator current diagnostic therapeutic approach diverse condition associate pediatric PH ; 4 . To determine response child PH chronic therapy . Aim 2 : Research Infrastructure To create robust scalable data architecture , combine traditional registry data , electronic Health Record ( EHR ) , PRO ( Patient Reported Outcome ) data single resource . Aim 3 : Informatics Address three class unanswered question crucial characterization management PH , compare information value registry vs. EHR vs. fuse data across registry/EHR/PROs , domains spectrum PH comorbidities , PH indicator endpoints morbidity mortality , response therapy PH .
