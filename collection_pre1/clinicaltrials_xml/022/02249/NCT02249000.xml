High surgical risk : Logistic EuroSCOREI ≥20 % ( equivalence EuroSCOREII ) STS score ≥10 % comorbidity judge heart team ( consist least one interventional cardiologist one cardiac surgeon ) pose absolute relative contraindication conventional aortic valve replacement accord VARC2 6 . Severe symptomatic calcific aortic valve stenosis characterize mean aortic gradient &gt; 40 mm Hg peak jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s effective orifice area ( EOA ) &lt; 1.0 cm2 ( &lt; 0.6 cm2/m2 body surface area ) 7 . Annulus diameter determine multislice compute tomography ( MSCT ) 2326 mm 1 . Transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) contraindicate 2 . Congenital bicuspid unicuspid valve 3 . Left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT ) obstruction hypertrophic obstructive cardio myopathy ( HOCM ) subject present systolic anterior motion ( SAM ) . Evidence intra cardiac mass , thrombus vegetation 4 . Transfemoral access vessel characteristic would preclude safe placement 18 French sheath 5 . Vessel and/or anatomical characteristic would preclude safe delivery BIOVALVE prosthesis ascend aorta and/or placement prosthesis 6 . Anatomical restriction shallow sinus heavily calcify leaflet , low height coronary ostia , extreme tortuosity aortic arch , thoracic ( TAA ) abdominal ( AAA ) aortic aneurysm , presence endovascular stent graft 7 . Severe mitral regurgitation grade &gt; 3 8 . Severe mitral stenosis 9 . Prosthetic mitral valve 10 . Severe leave ventricular dysfunction leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 20 % 11 . Hemodynamic instability 12 . Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) within 30 day prior index procedure / plan PCI index procedure 13 . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl ) subject dialysis and/or renal replacement therapy 14 . Any cerebrovascular event transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 180 day prior TAVI procedure 15 . Evidence acute myocardial infarction ( define ≥2 fold CK level absence CK ≥3 fold CKMB level upper range limit within ≤30 day prior TAVI procedure ) 16 . Blood dyscrasia define : leucopenia ( WBC &lt; 1000 mm³ ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 50'000 cells/mm³ ) , history bleed diathesis require blood transfusion 17 . Ongoing sepsis suspect active endocarditis 18 . Active peptic ulcer gastrointestinal bleeding within last 3 month would preclude anticoagulation 19 . Subject refuse blood transfusion 20 . Known hypersensitivity , contraindication nitinol , anticoagulation/antiplatelet regime , medication require procedure postprocedure determine heart team , sensitivity contrast medium adequately premedicated 21 . Need emergency TAVI intervention , medical , social , psychological condition opinion heart team precludes subject appropriate consent adherence protocol require followup exam 22 . Expectation subject improve despite treatment aortic stenosis 23 . Estimated life expectancy le 12 month due associate noncardiac comorbidities 24 . Severe pulmonary hypertension ( &gt; 60 mm Hg assess continuous wave Doppler , TTE ) clinical sign acute severe right ventricular dysfunction 25 .
