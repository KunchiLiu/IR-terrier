	<brief_title>Option B+ : Study Safety , Viral Suppression , Survival Second Line ART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Option B+ innovative strategy pioneer within Malawi provide universal lifelong ART ( tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz : TDF/3TC/EFV ) pregnant breastfeed woman promote maternal health prevent HIV transmission infant . The safety TDF/3TC/EFV base regimen use pregnancy systematically evaluate . Objective 1 : To characterize long term safety , drug resistance pattern clinical outcome among woman infant enrol Malawi Option B+ program use TDF/3TC/EFV . - Hypothesis 1 : Over 3+ year anticipated treatment follow-up , TDF/3TC/EFV associate toxicity rate require ART discontinuation &lt; 3 % &gt; 90 % virologic suppression 36 month . - Hypothesis 2 : Women baseline CD4 count ≤ 350 cells/mm3 experience great rate clinical event , treatment failure ART toxicity compare CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm3 . Objective 2 : To critically evaluate woman subsequent pregnancy initial engagement Option B+ Program . Objective 2a : To determine prevalence treatment failure among pregnant woman present ANC first-line therapy evaluate safety ATZ/r base therapy among woman require second-line therapy . - Hypothesis 1 : HIVRNA test first ANC visit among woman subsequent pregnancy demonstrate approximately 5 % woman fail treatment identify key risk factor associate treatment failure . - Hypothesis 2 : ATZ/r base therapy pregnancy associate toxicity rate require discontinuation le 5 % pregnant woman . Objective 2b : Among pregnant woman default TDF/3TC/EFV , determine treatment response re-initiation first-line therapy , need second-line therapy , characterize resistance . - Hypothesis 1 : Women re-engaging care program default experience early ART treatment failure due HIV drug resistance develop ART cessation initial care . Objective 3 : To explore rate adverse pregnancy birth outcome among woman , presence birth defect , infant developmental delay among infant expose EFV-based ART first trimester ( Objective 1 ) , Efavirenz conception ( Objective 2a ) , second-line therapy ATZ/r base ART ( Objective 2a ) . - Hypothesis 1 : Efavirenz exposure first trimester associate high rate adverse pregnancy birth outcome expose later pregnancy . - Hypothesis 2 : Infants expose EFV first trimester experience lower mean score Bayley neurodevelopment domain expose later pregnancy . The investigator collect data maternal treatment outcome , include vital status , per national HIV program definition : Alive , Dead , Default ( &gt; 3 month since last visit ) , Stop , Transfer Out . In addition maternal treatment outcome , national HIV program collect data regard follow outcome , investigator also collect : pregnancy tuberculosis incidence ART initiation , drug toxicity/ adverse event ( Rash , Hepatitis , Lactic Acidosis , Anemia , Peripheral Neuropathy ) , adherence measurement ( pill count ) , WHO clinical stage ART initiation , ART pharmacy refill information , ART regimen .</detailed_description>
