	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety efficacy Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug ( XIAFLEX ) treatment lipoma ( fatty tumor ) . The fat lipoma like normal fat except enclosed balloon-like structure make collagen ( fibrous tissue ) . Treatment lipoma injection XIAFLEX ( protein break collagen fiber ) may dissolve collagen/fibrous strand thereby decrease size lipoma remove . Each subject must two lipoma ; one lipoma treat placebo one lipoma treat study drug , observe similarly throughout trial .</detailed_description>
