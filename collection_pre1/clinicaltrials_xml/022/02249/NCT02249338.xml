	<criteria>A diagnosis COPD define American Thoracic Society criterion . Patients must relatively stable , moderate severe airway obstruction FEV1 ≤ 70 % predict value FEV1/FVC ≤ 70 % Screening Visit 1 Ability produce adequate induce sputum sample ad define : volume &gt; 1 ml : squamous cell less 80 % ability tolerate procedure least four minute bronchoconstriction ( fall FEV1 ≥ 20 % ) Greater 50 % neutrophils inducedsputum cell visit 1 . This requirement refer neutrophils percentage exclude squamous cell Males female age 40 80 year inclusive . Female patient childbearing potential participate study . Female patient participate study must meet least one follow criterion : surgically sterilize hysterectomy bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal least two year A smoke history ten pack year . A packyear defined equivalent smoke one pack 20 cigarette per day year Patients must able perform pulmonary function test maintain record study period require protocol All patient must sign Informed Consent Form prior tho participation trial , i.e. , prior prestudy washout usual pulmonary medication Culturedocumented and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment upper low respiratory tract infection within previous 4 week baseline period study Significant diseases COPD exclude . A significant disease define disease opinion investigator may either put patient risk participation study disease may influence result study patient 's ability participate study . Patients inflammatory disease e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , autoimmune disease exclude Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology , liver function , blood chemistry urinalysis , abnormality defines disease list exclusion criterion exclude . Laboratory parameter list protocol must within normal range , , document investigator clinically relevant . The following test may outside normal range extent indicate : Aspartate transaminase , Alanine transaminase , Total Bilirubin , Alkaline Phosphatase : 10 % &gt; upper limit normal ( ULN ) White blood cell count &lt; 3.80 x 10**9/L , Neutrophils &lt; 2.00 x 10**9/L , Platelets &lt; 100 x 10**9/L , Hemoglobin &lt; 12 x g/dL Urea Nitrogen , Creatinine : 10 % &gt; ULN A recent history ( i.e . within six month ) myocardial infarction A recent history ( i.e . within three month ) refractory heart failure unstable arrhythmia require treatment Patients know active tuberculosis A history cancer within last five year . Patients treat basal cell carcinoma cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma allow A history lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction , history cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis Previous thoracotomy pulmonary resection . Patients history thoracotomy without pulmonary resection evaluate per exclusion criterion . 2 The use oral corticosteroid within 4 week , theophylline oral longacting inhaled beta2agonists within 2 week visit 1 A change pulmonary therapy within 6 week prior screen visit 1 order control patient 's COPD A history asthma , allergic rhinitis atopy total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm**3 A history and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse Use investigational drug within one month six halflives ( ever great ) screen visit 1</criteria>
