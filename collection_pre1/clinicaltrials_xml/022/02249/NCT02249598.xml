	<brief_summary>In future likely replace current schedule inject vaccine intervention interrupt transmission infection subtle way . The agent cause meningococcal disease ( Neisseria meningitidis ) colonise nasopharynx individual . In people , bacterium harmless survive month nasopharynx , however minority people bacteria cause invasive disease . Simply reduce colonisation amongst target group may protect , rest population well . In previous study investigate cross protective antibody , find incidentally inoculate adult volunteer Neisseria lactamica , harmless ` cousin ` N. meningitidis , possibly prevent N. meningitidis carriage . If true could lead novel mechanism reduce colonisation target group , possibly form nasal medication . The propose study large experimental challenge study fund Meningitis UK aim establish N. lactamica inhibit colonisation N. meningitidis . We also determine whether N. lactamica displace exist N. meningitidis carriage , whether individual innately resistant Neisseria carriage . The study recruit 300 volunteer age 1830yrs two university Sheffield . It involve place droplet N.lactamica bacteria nose half group volunteer , harmless water like solution nose half volunteer . We carry nose swabs interval six month period establish pattern N.meningitidis carriage effect N.lactamica colonisation . If finding positive perform future mechanistic investigation .
