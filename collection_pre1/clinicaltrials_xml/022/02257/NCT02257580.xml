	<brief_summary>E-Aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) anti-fibrinolytic agent use decrease blood loss transfusion requirement several orthopedic procedure . The aim prospective double-blind placebo-controlled randomize trial determine whether IV EACA reduce intra-operative calculated total blood loss patient undergoing bilateral varus rotational osteotomy ( VRO ) . This study also investigate intraoperative cell saver utilization , transfusion allogeneic blood , hospital length-of-stay ( LOS ) , short term complication , long-term outcomes.This study provide Level I evidence potential improve outcome child undergoing procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participate anesthesiologist blind study arm hypothesis . Dr. Christopher Edmonds head anesthesiologist study administer anesthetic participant trial whenever schedule make possible . Anesthesia conduct standardized fashion , IV sedation use Versed IV propofol , +/- Fentanyl Ketamine . A Combined Spinal-Epidural ( CSE ) place use 12.5-20 mg bupivacaine . If CSE unsuccessful epidural and/or spinal successfully obtain , patient may still include study . Patients receive neuraxial anesthesia exclude . If patient require general anesthesia , induced time , patient exclude study . An arterial line additional venous access obtain standardize sterile practice . Sedation maintain IV propofol . IV Valium , Toradol IV acetaminophen give towards end case , per anesthesiologist 's discretion . The blood pressure target 20-25 % baseline , achieve primarily neuraxial anesthesia . For blood pressure range , epidural dose short-acting local anesthetic , and/or IV sedation titrate per anesthesiologist 's judgment . For hypotension range , pressor intravenous pressor give . An IV fluid bolus may also give amount 10-20cc/kg . Additional maintenance IV fluid give maintain urine output least 0.5-1ml/kg/hr . The criterion transfusion blood product hemoglobin level &lt; 7.0 g/dL hemoglobin level &lt; 10.0 g/dL clinical sign symptomatic anemia ( e.g. , unexplained tachycardia , hypotension unresponsive fluid vasopressor , change mental status , low urine output , shortness breath ) . Blood administer 1 unit time , presence symptom sign reassess unit . This algorithm may alter treat physician ( e.g. , PACU attending , surgeon , OR anesthesiologist ) , however decision support reasonable documentation . Drains removed POD 2 unless specify attending surgeon . Of note , chart patient clearly indicate him/her study patient ; sticker place front participate patient 's chart . Their enrollment also communicate clinician round note patient . Drains label study participant well , nurse record drain output per floor protocol . Attending surgeon , orthopedic surgery resident , physician assistant research assistant involve study assist data collection . For patient , collect demographic data , pre-operative CBC data , intra-operative cell saver auto-transfusion volume , post-operative number pack red blood cell unit transfuse , post-operative CBC data , post-operative drain output , post-operative complication . This information gather peri-operative medical record electronic medical record . Surgeons clinical research personnel review medical chart progress note evidence clinically significant VTE , reoperation , hematoma , seroma , infection .</detailed_description>
