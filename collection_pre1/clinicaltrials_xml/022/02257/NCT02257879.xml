	<brief_summary>Background : - Drinking grapefruit juice change long take medicine break body . Researchers find substance grapefruit juice call DHB contributes effect . Some dietary supplement contain DHB claim increase absorption supplement , medicine drug . But usually contain lot DHB glass grapefruit juice . Researchers want study effect grapefruit juice supplement DHB . Objective : - To compare certain dietary supplement ( sell DHB-300 ) versus grapefruit juice affect long take person body break medicine . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 - 60 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . - Participants 3 treatment visit . Participants drive home visit . Each visit last 13.5 hour include : - Questions medication participant health . - Vital sign take . - A finger probe measure oxygen . - Blood urine sample throughout visit . - An IV line insert arm vein . It stay throughout visit . - Study treatment : - Midazolam hydrochloride syrup give make people sleepy . - Loperamide tablet treat diarrhea . - 1 glass water , 1 glass grapefruit juice , 1 pill DHB-300 . A different one give treatment visit . - One week visit , participant certain fruit juice . They must fast night visit . - For 3 day visit , participant return clinic 4 time . Their vital sign check blood drawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin ( DHB ) one component grapefruit juice know irreversible inhibitor intestinal cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) . A single serving ( 240 mL ) grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) contain less equal 5 mg DHB . The pharmacokinetic boosting effect GFJ fuel marketing dietary supplement label contain DHB e.g . DHB 300 ( TM ) Trisorbagen enhance absorption naturally , While supplement find inhibit CYP3A activity , DHB content supplement much low , GFJ . Moreover , effect supplement pharmacokinetics CYP3A-metabolized drug largely unknown . This single-center , open-label , randomize , 3-period , single-dose , crossover study healthy volunteer compare drug interaction risk dietary supplement know affect CYP3A GFJ . The primary objective study compare effect supplement know affect CYP3A ( e.g.Trisorbagen ) GFJ water pharmacokinetics two model substrate , FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam , dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) substrate loperamide . This dual-probe substrate approach assess drug interaction risk provide mechanistic insight interaction observe . Eligible volunteer ( n=12 ) undergo 3 phase , comprise exposure visit 4 subsequent post-exposure visit collect blood urine 72 12 hour , respectively . Exposure visit schedule least 2 week apart allow washout phase . At exposure visit , participant administer oral dos midazolam hydrochloride ( 2.5 mg ) loperamide ( 16 mg ) concomitantly water ( 240 mL ) , GFJ ( 240 mL ) , Trisorbagen ( 240 mL water ) accord randomize treatment sequence . Blood urine collect pre-dose post-dose 72 ( blood ) 12 ( urine ) hour subsequent analysis relevant pharmacokinetic outcome probe substrate , include primary endpoint area concentration-time curve time zero ( pre-dose ) infinity ( AUC0-inf ) maximum observed concentration ( Cmax ) . Secondary endpoint include geometric mean , estimate treatment difference , within-subject between-subject treatment variance , well 95 % confidence interval around estimate .</detailed_description>
