	<brief_summary>After myopia , second etiology choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) young adult ( &lt; 50 year old ) idiopathic choroidal neovascularization ( ICNV ) whose etiology remain unknown . This rare severe disease , lead blindness . ICNV treat moment off-label anti-VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) therapy could also benefit aflibercept ( EYLEA ) , new anti-VEGF currently indicate Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . Case report suggest patient would need many injection AMD . INTUITION open-label , single arm , prospective , multicenter , phase II study . The main objective demonstrate effectiveness clinical term 52 week treatment aflibercept visual acuity patient affect ICNV . A specific dosage regimen design achieve maximum efficiency . The patient follow monthly basis 52 week . Intravitreal injection aflibercept initiate Treat &amp; Extend ( TAE ) regimen 20 week ( 3 mandatory injection reinjection case CNV activity ) . Then , pro nata ( PRN ) regimen consider 52 week ( reinjection case CNV activity ) .</brief_summary>
