	<brief_summary>The goal phase Ib clinical trial find dose drug safe . Although BGJ398 give patient safely , never give together imatinib mesylate . In study , test safety take BGJ398 imatinib mesylate . The investigator learn closely checking side effect patient may experience . Side effect see laboratory study , physical examination , ask patient.Once dose determine safe , large Phase II study do patient advanced GIST never receive prior treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must pathologically confirm GIST . In Phase Ib portion , must locally advance metastatic GIST progress imatinib . In Phase II portion , patient must newly diagnose imatinib treatment naïve advanced/metastatic setting . Prior adjuvant imatinib therapy allow long disease recurrence document ≥90 day last dose imatinib imatinib yet restart . Patients must least 18 year age . Disease must measurable RECIST 1.1 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Adequate renal , hepatic , hematologic function follow : Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , Total Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless due Gilbert 's Disease , Serum AST ( SGOT ) and/or ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5.0 x ULN consider due tumor ) , ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 , Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL . Patients childbearing potential must negative blood pregnancy test within 14 day treatment . Patients must agree use reliable barrier method birth control 3 month follow last dose study drug . Patient must adequate cardiac function ( left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥50 % determine multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ; QTc interval ≤480 m Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) . Patient must able take oral medication . Patients must sign informed consent document . For phase I , prior intolerance imatinib dose 400 mg daily . For phase II , receipt cytotoxic , biologic , immune therapy aim treat GIST except adjuvant imatinib systemic therapy conclude least 90 day prior registration . For Phase I , patient eligible regardless prior therapy . Chronic liver disease ( e.g. , cirrhosis ) Known positive serology HIV , active Hepatitis B , and/or active Hepatitis C infection . Patients history current evidence Central Serous Retinopathy ( CSR ) retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) major predispose factor CSR RVO ( e.g . uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension ) opinion study ophthalmologist . History retinal degenerative disease Active corneal disorder keratopathy ( e.g . corneal abrasion , bullous keratopathy ) Severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease , include : Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( A1c &gt; 8 ) Chronic Kidney Disease Stage III high ( Creatinine Clearance &lt; 60mL/min/m2 Modified Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) calculation ) Active , uncontrolled infection Known active brain metastasis unless treat show documented radiographic stability 28 day . Known active malignancy ( malignancy investigator determines unlikely interfere treatment safety analysis ) . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease , include follow Any history acute coronary syndrome include myocardial infarction , stable unstable angina , CABG , coronary angioplasty stenting know obstructive coronary artery disease . Symptomatic chronic heart failure ( New York Heart Association Criteria , Class IIIV ) Evidence clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and/or conduction abnormality &lt; 6 month prior screen except atrial fibrillation ( AF ) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ( PSVT ) Any history thrombotic cerebrovascular accident arterial thrombosis Uncontrolled arterial hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 155 mmHg diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg ) despite appropriate medical therapy . History and/or current evidence uncontrolled endocrine alteration calcium/phosphate homeostasis , e.g. , parathyroid disorder , history parathyroidectomy , tumor lysis , tumoral calcinosis , etc . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled ulcerative disease ; uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea ; chronic malabsorption syndrome ) . Patients major surgery within 3 week prior study entry recover side effect procedure . Women pregnant lactating . Sexually active male , unless use condom intercourse take drug 15 day stop treatment . They father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Patients significant history nonadherence medical regimen inability grant reliable informed consent .</criteria>
