	<brief_summary>This clinical research study make 2 part : Phase 1 Phase 2 . The goal Phase 1 study find high tolerable dose combination decitabine ruxolitinib give patient AML . The goal Phase 2 study learn decitabine ruxolitinib help control certain kind AML call post myeloproliferative neoplasm AML ( post MPN-AML ) . The safety drug combination study phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ruxolitinib Plus Decitabine Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Phases Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 6 participant enrol Phase 1 study , 24 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrolled Phase 1 , dose ruxolitinib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ruxolitinib . If intolerable side effect see , second group participant receive high dose ruxolitinib . If intolerable side effect see first group , 2 group enrol receive low dos first group . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive ruxolitinib high dose tolerate Phase 1 . All participant phase receive dose level decitabine . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . They may longer , need recover receive drug . You take ruxolitinib mouth 2 time every day ( 12 hour dose ) . You take drug without food , need take 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . If forget take schedule dose , take study drug within 3 hour miss dose . If 3 hour pass since miss dose , wait take study drug next schedule dose . On Days 1-5 cycle , receive decitabine vein 1-2 hour . Study Visits : At least 1 time every week Cycle 1 , least 1 time every 2 week cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , end cycle : - You bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease , cytogenetic testing , genetic testing . If doctor think need , extra blood ( 3 tablespoon ) drawn test . - You CT MRI abdomen/pelvis check status disease . Research Blood Tests : Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check substance blood may affect study drug may also predict response study drug . This blood sample drawn receive study drug , Cycles 1 3 , every 3 cycle . This also draw stop take study drug . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End Study Visit : When active treatment study end ( reason ) , ask return clinic End Study visit . The following test assessment perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You EKG . - You bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease , cytogenetic testing , genetic testing . If doctor think need , extra blood drawn test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw check status disease . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient intermediate high-risk myelofibrosis . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment patient several different type myeloid diseases myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . It investigational give drug combination patient AML . Up 42 participant enrol multicenter study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis AML ( WHO classification definition &gt; = 20 % blast ) 2 . In phase I portion study patient relapse refractory AML eligible . For Phase II portion study , patient must AML progress prior MPN ( MPNBP ) MDS/MPN 20 % blast . Temporary prior measure control blood count , apheresis hydrea allow . Patients newly diagnose previously treat disease eligible long prior therapy include hypomethylating agent . Prior therapy RUXOLITINIB MPN allow . 3 . Serum biochemical value follow limit unless consider due leukemia : Creatinine &lt; or= 1.5mg/dl total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 mg/dL , unless increase due hemolysis congenital disorder transaminase ( SG PT ) &lt; = 2.5x ULN 4 . Ability take oral medication . 5 . Ability understand provide sign informed consent . 6 . Performance status &lt; = 3 , unless directly related disease process determine Principal Investigator . 7 . Age &gt; = 18 year 1 . Any coexist medical condition judgment treat physician likely interfere study procedure result include uncontrolled severe infection , well uncontrolled cardiac disease , organ dysfunction . Patients history tuberculosis , HIV hepatitis B C exclude . 2 . Nursing woman , woman childbearing potential positive blood pregnancy test within 30 day study start , woman childbearing potential willing maintain adequate contraception ( birth control pill , IUD , diaphragm , abstinence , condom partner ) entire course study . 3 . Incomplete recovery prior surgical procedure surgery within 4 week prior study entry , exclude placement vascular access . 4 . Active clinically serious uncontrolled infection .</criteria>
