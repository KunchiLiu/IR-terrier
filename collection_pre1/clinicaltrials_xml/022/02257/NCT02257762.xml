	<brief_title>Efficacy Multiple Micronutrient-Fortified Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplement Children Under Two Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In Cambodia , progress combat malnutrition stall . In 2010 , 40 % child five ( 49 % 4-5 year-olds ) stunt , 11 % waste , 28 % underweight , indicate , respectively , chronic acute malnutrition , combination two . Stunting partially attribute poor complementary feeding , remain inadequate achieve growth outcome micronutrient status . Malnutrition prevent supplementary food . These food usually contain source protein lipid power milk , soy peanut , multiple micronutrient . They prepare fortify blended product , Corn-Soy Blend++ ( CSB++ ) , mixed water make porridge , ready-to-use supplementary food ( RUSFs ) . The latter usually lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNSs ) often paste peanut-based Plumpy'Nutâ„¢ . These energy-dense supplementary food contain macro micronutrient use prevent treat moderate acute malnutrition promote improve linear growth , weight gain micronutrient status among child . Until recently , treatment moderate acute malnutrition rely fortify blended product . The new RUSFs also prove effective , high energy longer shelf life , since require preparation , convenient . Another common nutrition intervention multiple micronutrient supplement Sprinkles . These individually-packed powder add food . However , micronutrient likely achieve growth outcome combine energy , example , lipid-based nutrient supplement evidence micronutrient powder alone contribute growth . Until June 2014 , United Nations World Food Program ( WFP ) use CSB++ ( call Supercereal Plus ) treat prevent moderate acute malnutrition Cambodia . Sprinkles also distribute , though widely , prevent micronutrient deficiency . These product recently currently use relatively expensive procure ship Cambodia case Sprinkles , effective food contain macronutrients . Moreover , CSB++ well accept practice , WFP phase . Therefore , UNICEF Cambodian Ministry Health look locally-produced product contain macro micronutrient prevent growth falter improve micronutrient status Cambodian child . TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY : Therefore , trial evaluate efficacy LNS child age 6-17 month prevent growth falter improve micronutrient statu . The impact product compare CSB++ , Sprinkles , control group . The trial prospective , cluster randomise , non-blinded control trial among infant 6-17 month age . The trial aim establish superiority novel LNS , use CSB++ Sprinkles active comparators unimproved diet control . The allocation ratio 1:1 . The study take place 8 month . The study conduct 28 site peri-urban Phnom Penh . Infants age 6-12 month recruit . Upon consent enrolment , baseline data collect participant . This include demographic , morbidity , anthropometry ( weight , height , mid-upper arm circumference , skinfolds ) , haematological stool sample , dietary data ( breastfeeding , food frequency dietary diversity ) . Data collect monthly , haematological sample collect endline . Participants provide one month supply food site allocate . Staff explain prepare food , often consume , consume ( i.e . subject ) . Participants provide food monthly basis . They continue consume food six-month period , time endline data , include haematological sample , collect .</detailed_description>
