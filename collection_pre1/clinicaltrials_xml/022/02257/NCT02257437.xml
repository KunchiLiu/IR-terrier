	<brief_title>Acceptability Multiple Micronutrient-Fortified Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplement Children Under Two Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In Cambodia , progress combat malnutrition stall . In 2010 , 40 % child five ( 49 % 4-5 year-olds ) stunt , 11 % waste , 28 % underweight , indicate , respectively , chronic acute malnutrition , combination two . Stunting partially attribute poor complementary feeding , remain inadequate achieve growth outcome micronutrient status . Malnutrition prevent treated supplementary food . These food usually contain source protein lipid power milk , soy peanut , multiple micronutrient . They prepare fortify blended product , Corn-Soy Blend++ ( CSB++ ) , mixed water make porridge , ready-to-use supplementary food ( RUSFs ) . The latter usually lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNSs ) often paste peanut-based Plumpy'Nutâ„¢ . These energy-dense supplementary food contain macro micronutrient use prevent treat malnutrition promote improve linear growth , weight gain micronutrient status among child . Until recently , prevention malnutrition rely fortify blended product . The new RUSFs also prove effective , high energy longer shelf life , since require preparation , convenient . Another common nutrition intervention multiple micronutrient supplement Sprinkles . These individually-packed powder add food . However , micronutrient likely achieve growth outcome combine energy , example , lipid-based nutrient supplement evidence micronutrient powder alone contribute growth . Until June 2014 , United Nations World Food Program ( WFP ) use CSB++ ( call Supercereal Plus ) prevent malnutrition Cambodia . Sprinkles also distribute , though widely , prevent micronutrient deficiency . These product recently currently use relatively expensive procure ship Cambodia case Sprinkles , effective food contain macronutrients . Moreover , CSB++ well accept practice , WFP phase . Therefore , UNICEF Cambodian Ministry Health look locally-produced product contain macro micronutrient prevent malnutrition Cambodia . Locally-produced product likely acceptable cheap import product . Regardless effective product may , vital determine acceptability give setting , word , child eat product caregiver feed . Acceptability child measure much eat readily , acceptability caregiver measure term sensory perception food , , smell , colour , taste . TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY : Therefore , trial evaluate acceptability LNS woman child age 9-23 month comparison CSB++ , Sprinkles add borbor . The trial cluster randomise , incomplete block , 4 x 4 crossover design aim establish superiority ( i.e . great acceptability ) novel LNS ( snack mixed borbor ) , comparison CSB++ , Sprinkles add borbor . The allocation ratio 1:1 . The study take place two part two week : 1 . Substudy 1 : Acceptability child , three day x four food total 12 day 2 . Substudy 2 : Acceptability mother , 13th day The study conduct peri-urban Phnom Penh . The study conduct four test-feeding site pagodas health centre . Participants recruit convenience village close four site . The four test-feeding site randomly allocate begin one food . All child give site eat food time three consecutive day . Upon consent enrolment , baseline data collect participant . This include demographic , morbidity , anthropometry ( weight , height , mid-upper arm circumference ) , dietary data ( breastfeeding , food frequency dietary diversity ) . Mothers ask bring child designate test-feeding site follow 12 day . They ask feed child precede hour , possible . The food give three day row , allow average result reduce effect chance finding . Children receive four food , namely , LNS add borbor , CSB++ porridge , Sprinkles add borbor , LNS snack , three day twelve day . Children group taste food different sequence ( balance carry-over effect ) . The mother ask feed child 15 minute child refuse eat . The amount food consume measured time child eats . Each mother ask assess think child like food , take account amount eat child 's reaction emotional state feeding . On 13th day , mother ask come test-feeding site , alone possible , rank food . For sensory test , food present one time . No weigh necessary mother expect eat whole cup . Between food , mother ask rinse mouth water . Mothers rate food respect colour , smell , taste , preparation process , overall opinion . The food present time mother ask rank . Finally , 14th day , small number mother ( 8-12 ) site ask stay focus group discussion relate infant feeding practice reason preference ranking .</detailed_description>
