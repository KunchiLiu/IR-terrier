	<detailed_description>The retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) second common retinal disease diabetic retinopathy , common cause unilateral visual loss . The occlusion branch central retinal vein ( BRVO ) central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) two topic discuss deserve study , especially need great clarity arise availability new diagnostic especially therapeutic opportunity . The literature prevalence RVO particularly rich , result available study heterogeneous study conduct case , use different methodology mainly characterize different distribution risk factor among different population . In regard , particularly interest publication 2010 propose combined analysis main study population ( population base study ) . The sample final analysis 49 869 subject , result show retinal vein occlusion overall prevalence , standardize age sex , 5.2 per 1000 , 4.42 0.80 BRVO CRVO respectively . Despite slightly high prevalence female , difference n't statistically significant . In contrast , prevalence venous occlusion increase increase age statistically significant manner , overall analysis occlusion branch central , individual entity . This pattern characteristic chronic degenerative disease fact RVO behavior similar disease , probably risk factor ( especially atherosclerosis systemic hypertension ) increase age . The result provide systematic analysis particularly important provide reliable estimate RVO prevalence general population ; must consider , however , inherent limitation mainly concern potential source heterogeneity , different methodology use , fact study carry single ethnic group , often different distribution risk factor therefore suitable capture difference . The risk factor predispose RVO many generally find vascular alteration involve part body case stroke coronary heart disease . Several author attempt determine whether disease consequent atherosclerosis therefore cause arterial disease rather pathogenesis venous disease . There variable delay onset symptom initiation treatment ; excessive delay treatment consider exclusion criterion minority study consider . Although difficult estimate age thrombotic event , early identification surely preferable treatment time critical factor evaluate efficacy therapeutic strategy . Because relatively small number patient possible determine therapy effective . Recently new experimental therapeutic approach propose , intravitreal administration various drug ( steroid , anti-VEGF ) . It yet clear whether approach eliminate need anticoagulant therapy acute phase disease . Surely antithrombotic drug may role treatment acute phase RVO , least category patient , use association intravitreal drug . Future study also explore possibility combine approach . The retinal vein occlusion disease relate age surely increase social-economic impact disease due increase population advance age group . To assess social-economic impact consider addition visual impairment related disease , impact quality life patient direct medical cost retinal vein thrombosis show one year patient disease average cost 20 % high hypertensive patient ( BRVO : + 16 % ; CRVO : + 22 % ) glaucoma one ( BRVO : + 18 % ; CRVO : + 24 % ) ; Therefore , although less frequent disease RVO affect considerably health care cost . The data available literature show overall one year management , direct cost great impact , percentage term , cost associate ocular pathology cause acute event ( thrombosis ) diagnostic test . After three year , however , cost link systemic disease ( hospitalization ) big impact percentage term , indicate retinal vein thrombosis nothing epiphenomenon systemic disease . Operating Modes The study divide 4 phase : Step 1 : establishment network : identification specialize facility ( ophthalmic emergency care thrombosis center ) , may accept patient suspected RVO , participate establishment register online ; Step 2 : Create registry recruitment patient cohort ; Step 3 : Follow-up plan ( 1 month ) instrumental test confirm diagnosis RVO ; Step 4 : Observational follow-up support dedicated web platform identification major adverse cardiovascular event , order export context clinical acquisition epidemiological disease management real time .</detailed_description>
