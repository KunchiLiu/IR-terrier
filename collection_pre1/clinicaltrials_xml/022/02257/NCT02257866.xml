	<brief_summary>Background : - Vasculitis group diseases inflame damage blood vessel tissue . It cause many medical problem . Few test diagnose disease , none reliably predict relapse . Researchers want study people gene follow people time see disease affect . Objective : - To learn sign , symptom , image test , genetic marker , blood test help identify people vasculitis predict happen time . Eligibility : - People age 5 old thought vasculitis , relate someone . - Healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants evaluate doctor expertise care patient vasculitis . - Participants give blood sample . Some give urine sample . - Some participant may brush biopsy take inside line nose . - Images participant blood vessel may take use scan . For scan , participant lie table move cylinder take picture . For scan , contrast agent may inject arm vein . Other scan may use radioactive form sugar . Healthy minor scan . - Some participant answer questionnaire . - Some participant test do NIH . Others doctor take blood , saliva , cheek swab sample send NIH . - Some participant one visit last 1 2 ( sometimes 4 ) day . Some participant may follow-up visit every 3 6 month , indefinitely .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Natural History , Pathogenesis , Outcome Idiopathic Systemic Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol study natural history idiopathic systemic vasculitis child adult . The idiopathic vasculitides group rare , systemic disease involve inflammation artery tissue result organ- lifethreatening disease course . The different form idiopathic vasculitis typically classify base upon predominant size artery affect condition , include small vessel vasculitis [ granulomatosis polyangiitis ( GPA , Wegener ) , microscopic polyangiitis ( MPA ) , eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis ( EGPA , Churg-Strauss ) ] ; medium vessel vasculitis [ polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN ) ] ; large vessel vasculitis [ giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) , Takayasu arteritis ( TAK ) , idiopathic aortitis ( IA ) ] 1 . Although patient type vasculitis manifest disease-specific aspect illness , substantial disease treatment burden common patient vasculitis . For type idiopathic vasculitis , disease course often chronic , relapse common unpredictable , organ tissue damage accrue time , new symptom occur late disease course , treatment often associate toxicity serious side effect . The goal natural history protocol establish cohort pediatric adult patient vasculitis prospectively evaluate sign symptom , image finding , blood tissue biomarkers associate pathogenesis disease outcome . In small vessel vasculitides , considerable progress make towards identify pathologic mechanism disease , focus elucidate pathogenic role neutrophil , select biomarkers SERPINA1 , novel candidate biomarkers circulate blood local tissue sit include nasal mucosa . In medium large vessel vasculitides , identify novel candidate biomarkers disease pathogenesis outcome develop disease activity index incorporate exist novel clinical , laboratory , genomic , image biomarkers . For type vasculitis , goal protocol identify patient possible entry future treatment study . Patients enrol protocol undergo history , physical examination , laboratory evaluation . Since vasculitis multi-system disease variable pattern organ involvement , patient may undergo comprehensive evaluation particular affect organ system clinically indicate . Peripheral blood sample collect affected patient , unrelated healthy volunteer match age , sex , ethnicity whenever possible , case unaffected family member help identify study gene involve vasculitis function . We may ask patient undergo nasal biopsy additional imaging study research purpose . For small number patient family member , may ask permission perform whole genome exome sequencing . Successful completion study improve understand disease pathogenesis .</detailed_description>
