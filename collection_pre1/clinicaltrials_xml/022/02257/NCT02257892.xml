	<brief_summary>Background : - The immune system help body fight infection disease . People immune system problem get infection , blood disorder , health problem . Researchers want learn immune system , like cause work properly . Objectives : - To evaluate people certain type immune system disorder . Eligibility : - Adults child immune disorder symptom one , relatives . Some disorder include study . Design : - Researchers review participant medical record . - Participants may mail blood saliva sample , evaluate clinic . At clinic , may medical history , physical exam , blood test , image scan ( dye give needle arm ) . They may genetic test do sample blood , saliva , hair , nail clipping . - Participants may choose skin biopsy . Up 2 skin sample take arm , back , area . A biopsy punch insert skin rotate . A small circle skin remove . - Participants 10 older may also choose leukapheresis . Blood take needle one arm . It pass machine separate white blood cell . The rest blood return needle arm . - Researchers may recommend medicine , treatment study . - Participants may invite return visit several year . At visit , may repeat test . Or may mail blood sample . They may also send medical record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Genetic Disorders Immune System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate patient suspect identified novel immune disorder , focus abnormal immune homeostasis potentially due defect activation apoptosis . Blood relative enrol patient also evaluate . Affected individual may Mendelian gene defect involve mostly single occasionally multiple gene . These patient may sign symptoms suggestive clinically significant lymphocyte homeostasis disorder . However , select patient manifest autoimmunity , autoinflammatory condition , end-organ dysfunction , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) viremia , frequent infection , allergy , laboratory abnormality consistent immune defect research interest Laboratory Clinical Infectious Diseases may also study protocol discretion Investigators . This protocol facilitate discovery role genetic pathway mode inheritance associate pathophysiological event lead immune system dysregulation , particularly disorder immune cell homeostasis . A good understanding genetics well biochemical molecular basis complex immune disorder could also lead development novel therapeutic target approach . Patients undergo clinical evaluation include history physical examination , blood sampling , radiological exam , genetic testing , skin biopsy , medically indicated procedure . Genetically related family member patient may also evaluate screened clinical , vitro , genetic correlate immune abnormality . Patients relatives unable sick travel NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) may evaluate mail-in blood sample . Patients relatives remain enrolled study observe natural history disorder obtain blood , saliva , skin biopsy , specimens periodic interval . This study aim enroll total 500 patient family member .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow inclusion criterion apply subject : Patient relatives age 099 year old . Only patient &gt; 2 year age physically evaluate NIH CC . Willingness allow storage blood , saliva , tissue specimen future use medical research . Willingness participate genetic test allow share genetic information secure databases like dbGAP . These test may include , limited , whole exome whole genome sequencing . Priority may give individual family history ( readily available ) suggestive multiple affect member constellation sign symptom suggestive immune dysfunction among first seconddegree relative . Patients must : An identified genetic basis immune disorder sign symptom suggestive clinically significant immune dysregulation and/or immunodeficiency manifest feature include limited autoimmunity , autoinflammatory condition , lymphadenopathy , endorgan dysfunction , unusual infection , allergy , laboratory abnormality consistent immune dysregulation . A primary physician outside NIH require submit letter clinical summary refer physician document relevant health history . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude following : Known genetic disorder already well characterize , severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) , chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , etc. , endure research interest LCID . Patients unknown immune disorder exclude receive chemotherapy within last 6 month malignancy infection HIV mycobacterial infection . Severe clinical illness require highly specialized team institution . The NIH may able provide appropriate care certain referred case . The Principal Investigator ( PI ) may determine patient eligible enrollment ineligible admission Clinical Center . Patients welldefined autoimmune condition systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , Hashimoto thyroiditis , Addison disease , Graves disease , sarcoidosis rheumatoid arthritis , among others . Blood relative exclude follow : Any condition opinion investigator may interfere evaluation immune system abnormality subject study protocol .</criteria>
