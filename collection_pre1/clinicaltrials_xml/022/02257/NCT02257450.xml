	<brief_title>Primary Aldosteronism Malaysia : A Nationwide Multicentre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension ( HPT ) common disease , expensive treat serious morbidity mortality . In Malaysia , NHMS III conduct 2006 , HPT affect 36 % adult . Essential HPT ( HPT identifiable cause ) account approximately 85 % case , whereas 15 % identifiable condition ( secondary cause ) . The detection secondary cause HPT important condition reversible detect early . Primary aldosteronism ( PA ) identify common cause secondary HPT . At present , PA regard common potentially curable , prevalence 5-13 % [ 1-7 ] . If condition detect early , chance cure hypertension report 80 % case . This translate major impact Malaysian health-care budget . The cost spend life-long BP medication complication related HPT reduce enormously . PA type hormonal disorder lead high blood pressure ( BP ) . In PA , adrenal gland produce much aldosterone cause sodium retention potassium excretion . The excess sodium increase blood volume BP . Diagnosis treatment condition paramount importance people form high BP high risk heart attack , stroke , kidney impairment , metabolic abnormality reduce quality life compare patient high BP due condition . More importantly , high BP associate PA may curable . This research conduct multicenter nation-wide study Malaysia . The research aim study prevalence disease investigator Malaysian population , determine underlie mechanisms disease associate high complication rate cardiovascular inflammatory marker , identify gene cause disease , hence provide rapid diagnostic test possibility cure disease genetic therapy</detailed_description>
