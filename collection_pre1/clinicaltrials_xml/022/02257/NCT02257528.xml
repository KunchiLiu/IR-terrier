	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Persistent , Recurrent , Metastatic Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity ( proportion objective response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 criterion ) nivolumab objective tumor response patient persistent , recurrent metastatic carcinoma cervix . II . To determine nature degree toxicity nivolumab assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) patient persistent , recurrent metastatic carcinoma cervix . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To systematically evaluate program cell death ( PD ) -1 B7 homolog 1 ( B7-H1 ) ( i.e. , PD-1 ligand ) expression tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) cervical cancer cell explore correlation objective response , PFS , OS nivolumab-treated patient PD-1 B7-H1 scoring result . II . To explore composition immune infiltrate tumor specimens/biopsies primary and/or metastatic/recurrent site select marker include ( limited ) cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ , CD8+ , forkhead box P3 ( FoxP3 ) , CD25 , lymphocyte activation gene-3 ( LAG-3 ) , T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 ( TIM-3 ) , inducible T-cell co-stimulator ( ICOS ) correlation objective response , PFS OS nivolumab-treated patient . III . To evaluate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) status explore change pre- post-immune therapy response HPV16/18/31/35/45 E7 antigens patient peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) serum use proliferative interferon ( IFN ) -gamma enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) ( cellular immunity ) serological ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] ) assay . IV . To explore level circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) pre-treatment 8 12 week association patient outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute every 2 week maximum 46 dos 92 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
