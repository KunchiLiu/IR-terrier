	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Treatment Clubfoot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose project help orthopaedic surgeon good understand treat patient diagnosis clubfoot . This propose research establish protocol collection relevant clinical functional outcome measure patient diagnosis clubfoot . The specific aim follow : 1 . To evaluate outcome infant undergo one two nonsurgical treatment intervention 2 . To evaluate outcome surgical intervention pediatric patient 3 . To compare long-term outcome patient receive 1. nonsurgical treatment 2. nonsurgical early intervention subsequent surgery 3. surgical intervention . BACKGROUND : The goal treatment clubfoot deformity obtain functional , pain-free , plantigrade foot , good mobility , without callosity . Nonsurgical treatment option available infant patient diagnosis clubfoot . Traditional non-operative treatment clubfoot deformity serial casting describe historically Kite successfully treat 15 % percent patient report McKay , 60 % patient report Harrold , 64 % report Price . Alternative treatment technique develop , include Ponseti casting technique French physical therapy method . The French physical therapy method daily massage tap implement Texas Scottish Rite Hospital good fair result 59 % ( 23 39 foot ) compare fair good result 12 % ( 4 33 foot ) use traditional serial casting . The Ponseti casting technique also gain attention recently 90 % excellent result report Noonan 94 % excellent result report Herzenberg . Evaluation improvement treatment protocol continue . Patients , fail achieve plantigrade foot either method , may treat surgically . Patients initially judge adequate correction , may later note persistent recurrent deformity undergo surgical intervention . For patient present diagnosis clubfoot beyond infancy surgery option treatment . As nonsurgical intervention , evaluation improvement surgical technique continue . Reports quantify functional outcome follow surgical intervention patient lack . For example , Garceau et al describe report result transposition anterior tibial tendon patient recurrent clubfoot . The procedure describe prevent recurrence deformity cause imbalance muscle evert invert foot . Since report , numerous author describe result transfer anterior tibial tendon treatment residual recurrent supination adduction deformity idiopathic congenital clubfoot . However , none study do prospective , quantitative manner utilized measurement obtain gait analysis . CONCISE SUMMARY OF PROJECT : All patient meet inclusion criterion agree participate study evaluate classification clubfoot reducibility ( Dimeglio 1995 ) , characterize four component clubfoot deformity include equinus , heel varus , calcaneopedal rotation , forefoot adduction . Patients allow select treatment either daily massage tap technique Ponseti casting technique . It practical feasible randomize patient transportation scheduling , well family preference willingness participate , primary factor French physical therapy method massage/taping . Once treatment intervention determine , patient enrol surgical one two non surgical arm ( French physical therapy Ponseti casting ) study . Research participation entail retrospective prospective review data collect standard medical care . All patient undergo clubfoot treatment , may follow evaluation : Standard-of-care - Clinical exams- conduct initial visit , 4 week , 8 week , 12 14 week , 6 month , 9 month follow treatment . Also 1 year , 18 month , 2 year , 3 year , 4 year , 5 year , 10 year age skeletal maturity . - Radiographs- standing AP laterals foot may take 18 month , 4 year age , skeletal maturity ( total 12 possible radiograph span study ) . Investigational - Questionnaires - age 4 , age 10 , skeletal maturity : patient/parent baseline assessment . - Radiographs- standing AP laterals foot ( total 4 radiograph ) take adult participant . - Movement Science Lab- 2 , 5 , 10 year age skeletal maturity . This testing may include walk reflective marker electrode attached tape his/her leg , walk across pressure plate , video , digital picture , wear step monitor , strength testing , agility test . - Physical therapy - 4 year age : developmental motor scale ; 10 year age skeletal maturity : motor proficiency assessment . - Brace compliance - patient temperature logger place shoe Dennis-Browne Bar initial fit visit Orthotics department . At every subsequent clinic follow-up visit Orthotist download time/temperature data onto laptop sensor reader ( A piece computer hardware sensor clip attach laptop via USB port ) . The Orthotist reset temperature logger disc order monitor next period brace wear . The following additional evaluation may conduct patient also surgical treatment clubfoot : Standard-of-care • Clinical exam radiographs conduct required surgeon . No additional radiograph need investigational purpose . Investigational • Movement Science Lab testing may do surgery , 1 , 2,5 , 10 year follow surgery , skeletal maturity . In addition , relevant retrospective data child 's medical chart include clinical history , radiograph , data collect Movement Science lab , may use . CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION OF SUBJECTS : Patients diagnosis clubfoot deformity seek treatment Orthopedic Clinics Texas Scottish Rite Hospital ask participate . Spanish speaking patient eligible participate study . CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION OF SUBJECTS : All patient without diagnosis clubfoot . SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL : Data collect research include follow : - Chart review- patient demographic - Clinical exams- include use Dimeglio classification record treatment progress , assessment physical therapy - Radiographs - Questionnaires - Movement Science Lab Assessment- use kinematics , kinetics , EMG , pedobarography , video , digital picture , step monitor , strength testing , agility test ( Pedi-Champ ) . - Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - BOT-2 : Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency - Patient brace compliance , record sensor implant shoe Retrospective data patient previously see Texas Scottish Rite Hospital Children may use study inclusion criterion meet . Since retrospective data would consist collect data patient ' medical record , consent form retrospective data use . Prospective data patient currently enrol clubfoot study IRB # 0101-037 , IRB # 0401-220 , IRB # 0903-545 use study inclusion criterion meet . RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECTS : All patient diagnosis clubfoot plan non surgical surgical treatment TSRH invite participate orthopedic physician his/her team . Patients diagnosis clubfoot , discharge care TSRH , may invite participate long term follow . These patient identify chart review . Study investigator identify eligible patient , contact prospective participant ask participate . Retrospective data patient combine long-term follow-up data collect upon enrollment . Physicians/Investigators recruit establish patient recruit patient unrelated practice . All patient treat Denis Browne bar inform temperature logger go inserted orthoses , temperature information download visit . They inform temperature information indicate whether , often , brace worn . Informing logger measure compliance would influence outcome study , therefore share patient . POTENTIAL RISKS : The risk associate participation child study different risk standard visit orthopedic surgeon Texas Scottish Rite Hospital Children , include minimal radiation exposure radiographic evaluation foot . For adult study , radiograph consider investigational . The amount radiation exposure , addition Standard Care , may receive study small ; comparable everyday risk drive 40 mile automobile . There inherent risk treatment idiopathic clubfoot deformity , include deformity , poor function , pain , need surgery , cast problem ( include skin breakdown , infection , etc . ) , neurovascular injury . The intervention study currently use treatment clubfoot deformity . These treatment protocol show good evidence reduce incidence inherent risk treatment clubfoot deformity . Possible risk related evaluation Movement Science Lab , may include skin irritation tape removal , muscle soreness follow strength test . There known physical risk associate sensor ( small disc size nickel coin ) attach inside sole area shoe . SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS : The Radiology Department follow standard shielding protocol radiographic examination . Females 10 25 year age require complete sign ( parent 's signature require child 17 year ) TSRHC Radiology Department `` Pregnancy Screening Radiological Procedures '' form prior Radiographic evaluation . PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY : All medical record datasheets keep within TSRHC maintain accordance hospital policy confidentiality patient record service . All data keep locked file store manage accordance HIPPA guideline . No patient information disclose . Signed consent form store Orthopaedic Research Coordinator 's Office . There possibility IRB may review research information . The IRB may review data collect study , insure research protocol follow patient 's right upheld . The IRB may contact research participant ensure continuity study record ask participant experience study . This information keep confidential accordance HIPPA guideline . POTENTIAL BENEFITS : This project employ treatment protocol currently use , attempt employ control consistent setting . Patients potentially benefit receive treatment improve outcome compare historic traditional treatment protocol . BIOSTATISTICS : Interim data analysis conduct report 2-5 year study . Interim report may include early result two non-surgical intervention early result particular surgical intervention . Ultimately compare outcome across three group : patient receive nonsurgical intervention ; receive nonsurgical intervention infant subsequent surgery ; undergo surgery . It determine need increase target enrollment current number 500 , enrollment 1000 . This number obtain power analysis provide biostatistician , indicate . Our biostatistician ask review exist study data determine sample size would need order get statistical significance follow set comparison : 1 . Comparing two treatment , severity level , see treatment give well outcome profile . 2 . Comparing 3 severity level , two treatment , see severity level correlate outcome , treatment . His response follow : For Set 1 , need increase sample size 90 % . For Set 2 , need increase sample size 20 % . Using data give , significant result see PT group , show correlation severity outcome . The result expect direction , severe disease lead high probability Poor outcome . RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT : The goal study well quantify follow result treatment .
