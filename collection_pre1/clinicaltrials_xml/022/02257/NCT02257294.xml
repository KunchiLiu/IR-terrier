	<detailed_description>Despite numerous intervention , remain need develop new way prevent microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) . The investigator aim select patient persistent S-T-elevation ECG occlude artery heavy thrombus burden initial angiography . These characteristic causally link MVO . Patients thrombotic culprit coronary artery reduce myocardial perfusion compare without presence coronary thrombus independent predictor adverse ischaemic outcome post-MI . Intra-luminal thrombus , reveal intra vascular image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) STEMI patient , show thrombus commonly persist culprit coronary artery , include within stent post-implantation , even thrombus invisible conventional angiography . The amount persistent thrombus predict likelihood persistent S-T-segment elevation , marker microvascular injury , impair perfusion.Therefore , coronary thrombus represent therapeutic target primary PCI . The pathophysiology MVO microvascular thrombosis elucidate MRI study reperfused MI swine . The investigator demonstrate LATE MVO correspond closely infarct zone haemorrhage reveal T2-weighted MRI pathology . The investigator observation validate Robbers et al show swine 7 day post-MI , LATE MVO haemorrhage correspond ( usually case ) , severe capillary loss disruption couple thrombosis inflammation . They conclude follow reperfusion , acute inflammation microvessel thrombosis result degradation endothelial integrity capillary breakdown . Very interestingly , histology also demonstrate diffuse microvascular thrombosis within area late gadolinium enhancement surround haemorrhagic core explains reduce perfusion ( wash first pas gadolinium contrast MRI ) within ischaemic area-at-risk . This observation point therapeutic potential local thrombolysis within culprit artery circulation.The study address question whether pharmacological strategy involve reduce dose alteplase give early primary PCI procedure prevent treat distal microvascular thrombosis MVO , subsequently , reduce infarct size.Current evidence around potential safety efficacy reduce dose fibrinolysis primary PCI limit . These limitation set-the-scene support rationale clinical trial : Full systemic dose intravenous fibrinolysis facilitate primary PCI potentially harmful increase risk off-target bleeding complication ; therefore , investigator use reduced-dose fibrinolysis . They directly infuse alteplase culprit artery achieve effective sustained local plasma concentration much low systemic concentration unbound drug . It anticipate bleed rate may low ; therefore , investigator measure fibrinogen patient . Fibrinogen haemostasis parameter serve surrogate measure bleeding ( safety ) . In line contemporary practice , investigator advise patient radial artery access whenever possible . Previous trial use streptokinase ( non-fibrin specific immunogenic ) ; study use fibrin-specific non-immunogenic second generation thrombolytic , alteplase The previous trial involve thrombolysis end primary PCI ( microvascular thrombosis may already establish reperfusion ) ; efficacy thrombolysis may greatest thrombus abundant begin primary PCI ; persistent residual fibrin strand adherent within culprit territory selectively target fibrinolytic therapy primary PCI ; thrombus form primary PCI procedure could treat sustained 'deep tissue ' thrombolytic effect locally administer intra-coronary alteplase ; term ease-of-use feasibility , may advantage give alteplase single dose.T-TIME Phase II evaluation two reduced dos alteplase , deliver locally , compare placebo STEMI patient receive PCI double-blind , randomise , parallel group , placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial . The investigator believe strategy intracoronary fibrinolysis complement therapeutic approach currently test . Should trial demonstrate EFFICACY future trial might involve factorial design placebo , alteplase intervention might also show effective intervening time order test comparative EFFICACY ( alone combination ) surrogate and/or clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
