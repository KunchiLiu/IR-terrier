	<detailed_description>Differences birth weight child kwashiorkor ( K ) marasmus ( M ) suggest intrauterine factor influence development two syndrome severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) . Such effect could play role set specific target dietary protein propose influence total energy intake ( TEI ) , body weight risk obesity . We recruit 63 adult survivor SAM , age 17 46 year , childhood treat Tropical Metabolism Research Unit ( TMRU ) Metabolic Ward . Data birth weight , age , weight length admission abstract TMRU record . Subjects provide write informed consent . The study approve Faculty Medical Sciences Ethics Committee , University West Indies . Measurements conduct two phase . All subject see single-sex pair stay dedicate metabolic suite 9 consecutive day . During phase 1 ( day 1 3- choice experiment ) ate freely mealtime menu comprise combination food contain different percentage energy protein ( PEP ) , set 10 % , 15 % 25 % ( 26 ) . During phase 2 ( day 4 8 ) , pair randomize one three group receive food contain 10 % , 15 % 25 % PEP . The participant blind treatment . Participants take 1-hour supervised walk day 4 pm . Thirty-one local recipe 10 sweet 21 savoury food select . Each modify three recipe contain 10 , 15 25 % energy protein addition food ingredient , protein mix and/or maltodextrin ( Ross Nutrition ) . Carbohydrate adjust 60 , 55 45 % energy dietary fat keep constant 30 % . The PEP version food/recipe taste test ability determine protein concentration dish due appearance , smell texture well pleasantness . If taste tester able detect difference , recipe adjust retested difference detect . Up 11 food provide day 8-day period , give participant variety choice time indicate table 1 . During first three day ( phase 1 ) , three food item fruit vegetable salad tea offer breakfast , lunch dinner participant . These three food item meal time include food contain 10 % , 15 % 25 % protein energy . From day 4 8 ( phase 2 ) , daily food type repeat every three day food contain 10 PEP one group , another group contain 15 PEP , third group contain 25 PEP protein . Breakfast provide 8 , lunch 12:30 pm dinner 6 pm . During phase snack item make freely available time . The amount eaten determine weigh food item consumption eaten near gram . The food serve weighed quantity tar container . Plates single design neutral ( white ) color . The size , style color plate use 10 , 15 25 PEP version food . Participants offer optional food include 100g fruit salad , decaffeinate tea sweeten measured amount brown sugar breakfast , 100g vegetable salad lunch dinner . A three-day food diary complete prior 8 day ad libitum test period food consume test period analyse total energy , protein , carbohydrate fat content . The weight subject without shoe light clothing measure daily near 0.1 kg ; height measure near 0.1 cm . Fat fat-free mass obtain DEXA measurement . Weight gain calculate day 1 4 phase 1 day 4 8 phase 2 .</detailed_description>
