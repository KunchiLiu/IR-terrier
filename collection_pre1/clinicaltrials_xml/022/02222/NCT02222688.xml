	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety investigational agent , cirmtuzumab . Cirmtuzumab monoclonal antibody drug design attach protein , call ROR1 , surface chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cell block cell growth survival . ROR1 rarely express healthy cell idea preferentially get rid cancer cell . Although evidence laboratory animal cirmtuzumab decrease number CLL cell , investigator know work human . This drug give human first time study . Therefore , goal study see cirmtuzumab safe tolerate study participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UC-961 ( Cirmtuzumab ) Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first human , open-label single institution , Phase I dose escalation study patient relapse refractory CLL . Treatment cycle ( 14 day ) consist UC-961 administer intravenously bi-weekly ( every two week ) schedule total 4 dos . Eight dose cohort ( 3 6 patient size ) plus expansion cohort 6 patient plan . In first 3 dose cohort , intra-patient dose escalation monitor acute toxicity , tumor lysis syndrome . A cycle may repeat every 14 day patient least stable disease clinical examination ( interim response assessment ) meet hematologic , renal , hepatic laboratory parameter define eligibility section , without ongoing Grade 3 non-hematologic Grade 4 hematologic toxicity attributable UC-961 . The total duration study drug administration 4 cycle . Each cycle consist clinical laboratory evaluation Day 1 safety assessment Days 3 8 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical phenotypic verification B cell CLL measurable disease . Immunophenotyping leukemic cell must demonstrate monoclonal B cell population immunophenotype consistent CLL Relapsed refractory disease , defined failure achieve partial response within 6 month initiation therapy , 50 % increase baseline disease measurement achieve clinical response . Not amenable approved therapy . Prior Therapy : Must progress purineanalog alkylator base therapy , consider inappropriate chemoimmunotherapy due one following : Del 17p , associate poor response chemoimmunotherapy , Age great 70 , Age great 65 one following : Grade 3 neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia attributable cumulative myelotoxicity prior administration cytotoxic agent ( document bone marrow biopsy obtain since last prior therapy ) , Clinically apparent autoimmune cytopenia may exacerbate fludarabine therapy , Estimated creatinine clearance ( eCCr ) &lt; 70 mL/min ( determine CockcroftGault method ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status great 0 . Has recover toxic effect prior therapy clinical baseline . Subjects must age 18 year old . Women childbearing potential must agree become pregnant duration study . Subjects must least one follow indication treatment : Symptomatic progressive splenomegaly ; Symptomatic lymph node , nodal cluster , progressive lymphadenopathy ; Progressive anemia ( hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL ) ; Progressive thrombocytopenia ( platelet ≤ 100 x 109/L ) ; Weight loss &gt; 10 % body weight precede 6 month period ; Fatigue attributable CLL ; Fever night sweat &gt; 2 week without evidence infection ; Progressive lymphocytosis increase &gt; 50 % 2month period anticipate doubling time le 12 month . Subjects must ECOG performance status 02 . Adequate hematologic function Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Adequate coagulation test Pregnant breastfeed woman enter study due risk fetal teratogenic adverse event see animal/human study . Patients currently receive another investigational agent exclude . Patients chemotherapy ( e.g. , purine analogue , alkylating agent ) , immunotherapy , radiation therapy , participation investigational drug treatment within 4 week initiation UC961 time study . Patients prior ( within 8 week initiation UC961 ) concurrent antibody therapy direct CLL ( i.e. , Rituxan® Campath® ) Current infection require parenteral antibiotic . Active infection HIV , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Concurrent malignancy prior malignancy within previous 3 year ( completely resect carcinoma situ , prostate cancer , localize nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Known central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement malignancy . Untreated autoimmunity autoimmune hemolytic anemia , immune thrombocytopenia . Uncompensated hypothyroidism ( define thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) great 2x upper limit normal treated replacement hormone ) . Presence 55 % prolymphocytes peripheral blood . Patients Richter 's transformation exclude . Insufficient recovery surgicalrelated trauma wound healing . Impaired cardiac function .</criteria>
