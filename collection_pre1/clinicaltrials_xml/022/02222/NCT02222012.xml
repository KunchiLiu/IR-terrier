	<detailed_description>The `` Multiway stimulator coil速 '' ( Brainsway Ltd. ) novel TMS stimulator several new unique property . Currently standard TMS device include single channel , operate single coil . The `` Multiway stimulator coil速 '' ( Brainsway Ltd. ) include two channel operate two independent TMS coil , either simultaneously sequentially . The `` Multiway stimulator coil速 '' ( Brainsway Ltd. ) may use obtain differential activation various brain region . For instance use induce high frequency stimulation certain brain region , thus induce facilitation , simultaneously stimulate low frequency another brain region , lead inhibition . In current study investigator propose multi-source pattern integrates neuroimaging data associate multiple , symptom-related neural process relevant depression improve classification accuracy . The investigator conclude combine brain activation relate core-symptoms depression use multi-source monitoring data substantially increase classification accuracy provide sparse relational neuromarkers-model future prediction . The purpose study monitor optimize anti depressive effect brain modulation technique use novel multi model monitoring approach . Subjects treat one two design study device ( `` Multiway Coil速 '' ) : 1 . Single Channel coil place leave PFC ( 10 Hz ) . 2 . Two channel : . 10 Hz leave PFC . b . 1 Hz right PFC . All subject current study undergo monitoring procedure inclusive functional MRI electroencephalogram .</detailed_description>
