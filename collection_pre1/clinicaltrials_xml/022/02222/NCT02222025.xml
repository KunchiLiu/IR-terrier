	<brief_summary>Playing football induce considerable beneficial health effect , also high-intensity high-impact sport many situation direct contact player bear risk injury . Thus , necessary implement preventive measure reduce risk injury support health benefit . Injury characteristic player older 13 year similar adult player , thus , similar preventive measure beneficial . Younger player seem show partly different injury characteristic . Consequently , preventive programme proven effective late adolescent adult player need adapt young age group . To date , study investigate prevention football injuries child age 13 year . We aim assess effectiveness exercise-based prevention program reduce football-related injury child young 13 year . The primary outcome study overall injury rate . Secondary outcome rate severe injury acute injury . The study design two-armed cluster-randomized control trial . We recruit 9 12 year old child ( boys girl , born 2002 2005 ) participate regular training match play officially register football club Switzerland ( study centre locate Netherlands , Germany Czech Republic ) . The chosen age group usually subdivide two age category ( 9/10 year , 11/12 year ) . Recruitment take place via national regional football association . Inclusion criterion : club must officially register regional football association , child must 9 12 year old start study regular training must take place least twice per week . Teams exclude , coach already perform structure warm-up focus neuromuscular control exist injury prevention programme . Injury surveillance include baseline questionnaire , players´ exposure injury registration . Anthropometric baseline data information regard previous football-related injury obtain prior start study parent . Injury exposure surveillance assist automated internet-based injury record system develop applied epidemiological project . For participate team , one contact person appoint . Those person provide exact instruction injury definition well examples complete injury exposure form within online injury record system . If injury occur , one train person contact coach well player parent telephone and/or e-mail ass relevant aspect injury base standardized injury registration form . In case injury require medical treatment parent support receive exact diagnosis attend physician ( either specific write diagnosis use specific injury cod system ) . Two blind investigator additionally assess information regard injury allow objective independent injury surveillance . 20 study assistant 4 scientific assistant support coach data collection injury record . Each study assistant responsible eight club . Study assistant regularly keep touch club visit two training session team study period . The intervention period last one complete season . The injury prevention program include begin usual football training replace traditional warm-up . The programme conduct least two time week intervention team . The prevention programme contains seven exercise last 10 15 min familiarisation . Three exercise focus unilateral , dynamic stability low extremity ( hop , jump landing ) . Further , three exercise emphasize whole body trunk stability . The last exercise contain roll movement improve fall technique . The coach control group receive instruction regularly perform common warm-up consist run ball-based exercise ( sham treatment , neuromuscular stability exercise ) . The yearly incidence injure player child 8.6 % . A risk reduction one third recently acknowledge relevant effect size injury rate . This correspond reduction yearly incidence 5.8 % injured player . In order achieve statistical power 80 % take allocation ratio 1:1 cluster-inflation factor 1.7 account , total 4´000 player need statistical analysis . Assuming realistic drop-out rate 33 % , 6´000 child initially recruit .</brief_summary>
