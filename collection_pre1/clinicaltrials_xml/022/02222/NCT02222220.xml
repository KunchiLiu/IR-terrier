Previous study demonstrate different medication substitute benzamide derivative group : amisulpride , sulpiride ( higher selective bind D2/D3 dopamine receptor ) moclobemide ( reversible inhibitor monoamine oxidase A , inhibit deamination serotonin , norepinephrine dopamine ) may effective treatment clozapine-induced hypersalivation ( CIH ) .

	<brief_title>Metoclopramide Treatment Clozapine-induced Hypersalivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypersalivation ( sialorrhea ptyalism ) know frequent , disturb , uncomfortable adverse effect clozapine therapy may persist several year . This side effect usually dose-related . It may occur day , pronounce night sleep , since swallow reflex diminish , patient usually complain waken wet pillow ( sometimes call `` wet pillow '' sign ) . Salivation regulate sympathetic ( adrenergic ) parasympathetic ( cholinergic ) tone . The phenomenon clozapine-induced hypersalivation ( CIH ) remain mysterious since drug potent α2 antagonistic , M4 - muscarinic agonistic , anticholinergic ( M1 , M2 , M3 , M5 ) activity different effect control salivation . While α2 antagonistic M4 - muscarinic agonistic effect increase salivation , anticholinergic effect lead diminish saliva secretion . It report CIH observe 10 80 % patient accord various source , average rate 30 % clozapine-treated patient . Further social embarrassment relate hypersalivation , additional consequence CIH include painful parotid gland swell parotid duct obstruction due formation calculus . Clozapine second generation neuroleptic agent whose structure consist dibenzodiazepine derivative piperazinyl side chain . It unique neuropharmacologic profile , attribute atypical antipsychotic agent proven efficacy refractory schizophrenia , widespread use limited adverse effect agranulocytosis , seizure , sedation , weight gain , sialorrhea . Clozapine weak binding affinity dopamine D1 D2 receptor slightly great preference D1 receptor , note D1 : D2 receptor bind ratio 1:3 . Furthermore drug potent bind affinity serotonin receptor 5-HT1A 5-HT2 , also antihistaminic , anticholinergic , alpha-adrenergic antagonistic property . Sialorrhea troublesome stigmatizing nature result schizophrenia patient lead massive compliance problem . For management distress side effect recommend different pharmacological agent α2 - adrenoreceptor agonist , include clonidine , lofexidine , treatment unwanted side effect , prove effectiveness . They routinely use . These publication show CIH probably might different neurobiological basis rather propose mediation M4 - muscarinic receptor . Previous study find substitute benzamide derivatives high selective binding D2/D3 dopamine receptor - amisulpride , sulpiride well moclobemide ( reversible inhibitor monoamine oxidase A , inhibit deamination serotonin , norepinephrine dopamine ) may effective treatment CIH without additional adverse effect . Unfortunately , medication effective patient suffer CIH . Metoclopramide first describe Dr. Louis Justin-Besançon C. Laville 1964 . It dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , mixed 5-HT3 receptor antagonist . Moreover , 5-HT4 receptor agonist . Metoclopramide fairly often use general medicine antiemetic agent . In 1979 , FDA approve treatment nausea vomit . This drug also belong substitute benzamide derivative group . It assume anti-emetic activity cause D2 receptor antagonism chemoreceptor trigger zone central nervous system . Dry mouth one side effect . The investigator hypothesize antisalivation effect characterize whole group benzamides , demonstrate also none psychotropic agent like metoclopramide . The aim study examine efficacy metoclopramide additional agent management CIH approve hypothesis . Subjects Methods The study conduct January 2012 May 2014 two large state referral institution : Tirat Carmel Mental Health Center Be'er-Sheva Mental Health Center . The investigator screen 68 patient ( male female , 19-60 year old ) suffer schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , treat clozapine , suffer hypersalivation . Of screened subject , 7 patient refuse take part study . Inclusion criterion : ) male females age 18-60 year old ; b ) meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , Text Revision , criterion schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder ; c ) Clozapine treatment minimum 2 month ; ) Constant dose clozapine concomitant medication previous 2 week ; e ) At least 2 point Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale ( NHRS ) ; 3 f ) Ability willingness sign inform consent participation study . Study exclusion criterion include : ) Presence concurrent medical condition contribute hypersalivation ( eg , idiopathic Parkinson 's disease , cerebral palsy ) ; b ) Evidence mental retardation ; c ) Alcohol drug abuse . Patients treat anticholinergic agent continue experience CIH allow participate study , provide continue suffer CIH least moderate severity . Complete medical neurological examination , include laboratory test , perform . Prior study entry , subject meet inclusion criterion provide write informed consent receive full explanation regard nature study potential risk benefit . The study approve Tirat Carmel Mental Health Center Be'er Sheva Mental Health Center Institutional Review Boards . Study Design The study conduct two mental health center . In order examine hypothesis , investigator use add-on design . Sixty-one patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder ( male female , 19-60 year old ) , accord DSM-IV criterion , treat clozapine suffer hypersalivation , enrol study ( 30 patient metoclopramide group 31 placebo group ) . Procedure drug administration In order find minimal effective dose , subject suffer CIH ( score &gt; 2 Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale - NHRS ) double blind randomized mode treat week 10 mg/day metoclopramide placebo . The patient without improvement continue study 20 mg/day metoclopramide placebo next week . Those patient , respond dose , continue 30 mg/day metoclopramide placebo another week . Hypersalivation assess subjective objective tool . Clinical global impression ( CGI ) patient 's self-assessment take subjective tool NHRS Drooling Severity Scale ( DSS ) objective one . NHRS consist 5-points : 0-absent ; 1-minimal ( sign saliva pillow morning ) ; 2-mild ( hypersalivation wake patient night ) ; 3-moderate ( hypersalivation wake patient twice night ) , 4-severe ( hypersalivation wake patient least 3 time night ) . DSS also consist 5-points : 1- never drool , 2 -mild , wet lip , 3-moderate , wet lip chin , 4-severe , clothing becomes wet 5 - profuse , clothing , hand , tray , object become wet . Assessment perform baseline ( enter study ) every morning study period two week cease add-on medication . Clinically significant improvement define reduction least 30 % baseline week 2 NHRS DSS . Participants Thirty patient Be'er Sheva Mental Health Center 31 Tirat Carmel Mental Health Center participate study . The study approve local Institutional Ethics Review Board ( `` Helsinki Committee '' ) . Only subject able sign write informed consent form participation study , recruit . Confidentially ensure mean number cod system , complete research form store secure area .</detailed_description>
