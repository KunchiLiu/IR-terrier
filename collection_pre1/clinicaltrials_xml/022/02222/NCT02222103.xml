	<brief_summary>The investigator propose use wearable device , MultiSenseTM , develop Rhythm Diagnostic Systems , Inc. many sensor inside `` Band-Aid '' like strip order see help diagnose capability individual suspect obstructive sleep apnea . The MultiSenseTM sensor self-contained , reusable , rechargeable , battery-powered , flexible strip , measure 4 X 1.2 inch simultaneously track record number physiological health related parameter ECG , heart rate , pulse synchronize oxygen saturation , temperature , respiratory rate , depth respiration motion/position . One advantage device current home diagnostic system capability record several night . The objective compare multiple biometric parameter track MultiSenseTM gold standard monitoring accredit sleep lab use polysomnography . Home monitoring explore potential finding supportive sleep apnea monitoring home routine sleep 5 7 night . Enrolling 10 adult already schedule medically indicate sleep study help u make determination . Subjects wear device , size Band-Aid , via adhesive chest period 10 day . Subjects go normal daily activity return device via mail complete .</brief_summary>
