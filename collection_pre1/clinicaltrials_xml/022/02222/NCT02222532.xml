	<brief_summary>Infants child undergo cardiac surgery require mechanical support circulation call cardiopulmonary bypass . The artificial pump ensure blood flow body maintain surgical procedure heart . However , pump circulation disrupts regulation thyroid hormone . This hormone critical regulator heart circulatory function . Deficiencies thyroid hormone adversely affect recovery heart cardiac surgery . A recent study principal investigator show supplement patient young 5 month old shortened time spend ventilator ( breathe machine ) surgery . Populations undergo heart surgery develop country Indonesia different U.S. industrial nation . For many heart defect child undergo surgery old age . They sicker long period , often malnourish . These old malnourish child low thyroid hormone level even prior surgery , show dramatic drop surgery . Shortening time ventilator improve recovery , also improve overall availability resource develop country . The formulation thyroid hormone provide U.S give intravenous relatively expensive . However , much inexpensive formulation available Indonesia , give tube extend nose stomach . We propose test formulation make Korea , know Tetronine , two vulnerable population Indonesia : child young 5 month age , old 5 month malnourish . All patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass congenital heart defect . This project important collaboration U.S Indonesian investigator . If successful , general positive impact care entire population young child undergo cardiac surgery develop country reduce time ventilator improve access care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Study Overview Objectives We perform randomize double blind placebo control trial Indonesian child 3 year age , undergo cardiopulmonary bypass procedure correction palliation congenital heart disease . The study approve Ethic Committee Medical Research National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita ( NCCHK ) . Age 3 year choose cutoff , population &lt; 3 year high mortality rate Indonesia . Also , cutoff reduces age-based population heterogeneity , could confound analysis . We study two independent vulnerable cohort within population previously note . 1 . Age &lt; 5 month 2 . Age &gt; 5 month &lt; 3 year moderate severe malnutrition Moderate severe malnutrition define weight 15 % predict value height . The predicted value determine use WHO clinical growth chart base patient gender baseline length weight measurement . There overlap study cohort ( patient ≤ 5 month age patient &gt; 5 month age moderate severe malnutrition form mutually exclusive group ) . Thus , study view two separate , independent trial , overall type I error rate 0.05 ( 2-sided ) . The primary endpoint within study cohort comparison time first death , 7 day , extubation base log-rank statistic separate Cox Proportional Hazards Models . These model include Aristotle Score baseline covariates imbalanced across treatment group . Patients monitor first death , withdrawal consent , hospital discharge . Safety Endpoints Safety endpoint study include : 1 . Death cause prior hospital discharge 2 . Death use mechanical circulatory life support 3 . Incidence serious adverse event 4 . Incidence unexpected adverse event 5 . Incidence arrhythmia specific arrhythmias Objective 1 . To establish efficacy Tetronine® , Dalim Biotech Korea ( oral T3 ) improve clinical outcome Indonesian child age 0 5 month congenital heart disease surgery associate cardiopulmonary bypass . Eligible population : The age distribution child undergo cardiac surgery Indonesia substantially different U.S . Very patient NCCHK le 6 week age undergo cardiopulmonary bypass procedure ( 7/400 sequential patient 2011-12 ) . As The Triiodothyronine Cardiopulmonary bypass Infants Children ( TRICC ) trial indicated benefit T3 supplementation U.S child age 5 month , study age group within scope specific aim 1 use Tetronine . This single center study perform Indonesia NCCHK . Historical record show approximately 170 NCCHK patient eligible specific aim 1 portion study within 3 year enrollment . Objective 2 . Patients older 5 month enrol screen weight equal le -2 Z Score height WHO DATA Table Infant Weight Length Charts gender . Historical record NCCHK show 160 patient eligible specific aim 2 3 year period . Studies require achieve objective run concurrently . Power Analysis : We determine requirement 120 patient objective 1 100 patient specific aim 2 achieve reasonable power . Safety Adverse Event ( AE ) Reporting Although study perform Indonesia come regulation U.S Food Drug Administration , use FDA standard report adverse event . Reporting adverse event cardiac surgical trial infant complicate regulatory guidance specific conduct clinical research critically ill child . We use The Pediatric Heart Network report method predefined `` sentinel event '' place serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . Data Analysis Two population consider . ITT Population The primary efficacy analysis population base principle Intention-to-Treat ( ITT ) , include randomize patient receive double-blind study medication . Patients group accord randomization assignment . As-Treated Population The As-Treated population use patient mistakenly receive wrong treatment issue dose . In As-Treated analysis , patient group accord treatment actually receive . All safety analyse consider As-Treated population . Analysis primary efficacy outcome The primary analysis perform use Cox Proportional Hazards , include term stratification factor ( age , Aristotle score nutrition status ) . Patients include analysis randomize receive least one dose study drug accord principal Intention-to-Treat ( ITT ) . Occasionally patient randomize surgery cancelled reschedule due scheduling conflict , due patient related issue . This rarely result patient miss study medication operation reschedule last minute . However , since study double-blind , ITT principal preserve treatment assignment blind unknown person responsible decision . Handling miss values/ censoring/ discontinuation In event parent patient withdraw consent prior extubation , patient censor time discontinuation . Patients die prior extubation censor time death . For primary efficacy analysis , patient remain intubated 7 day post cross-clamp removal ( 168 hour ) censor 7 day . It imperative date time extubation record accurately . If reason date time extubation record , patient consider intubated 7 day censor 7 day . Sensitivity analyse The two plan sensitivity analysis use identical model primary analysis , time extubation may different patient ( extubation occur 7 day 30 day , first sensitivity analysis , successful extubation coincide clinical readiness extubation second sensitivity analysis ) . Subgroup Analyses For subgroup variable , treatment-by-subgroup term add primary analysis model test heterogeneity treatment effect across subgroup . The primary analysis model repeat within subgroup ( remove term stratification factor relate subgroup interest individual model ) . Planned subgroups analysis include : 1 . Nutritional state ( normal , mild , moderate severe malnutrition determine percent expect weight length ) 2 . Age &lt; 6 week versus ≥ 6 week 3 . Age &lt; 24 month versus ≥ 24 month 4 . Aristotle score category ( 6.0-7.9 , 8.0-9.9 , 10.0-15.0 4 ) 5 . High risk versus Lower risk Aristotle score ( &lt; 10 versus ≥ 10 ) Analysis secondary efficacy objective Time inotropic agent analyze base percent time first 48 hour inotropic agent use . Patients require inotropic agent include analysis 0 % first 48 hour use . The distribution percent 48 hour inotropic agent right-skewed , Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test use assess treatment difference . Non-parametric regression may also use account stratification factor . Inotropic score likely also right-skewed , similar analysis technique use . Mean heart rate mean systemic mean blood pressure baseline , 1 , 6 , 12 24 hour post cross-clamp removal assess use ANCOVA , control stratification factor . Total free T3 level baseline , 1 , 12 , 24 48 hour post cross-clamp removal right-skewed . Lactate level also draw time point indicator metabolic status , often used clinical indicator pediatric cardiac intensive care unit . Differences across treatment group assess use Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test use assess treatment difference . Non-parametric regression may also use account stratification factor . Longitudinal analysis may also perform . Post-operative ICU Hospital stay duration right-skewed . Differences across treatment group assess use Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test use assess treatment difference . Non-parametric regression may also use account stratification factor . Analysis safety endpoint Safety endpoint report individually , incidence rate treatment . Fisher 's Exact Test Chi-square test use assess treatment difference . Odds ratio adjust stratification factor may also produce .</detailed_description>
