	<brief_title>Composite Resins Reconditioned , Behavior Survival : Clinical Follow-up 10 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cohort 26 patient age 18-80 year old ( mean : 28.35 year ; 42 % men , 58 % woman ) 78 composite restoration ( Class I : 39 ; Class II : 39 ) recruit Operative Dentistry Clinic Dental School University Chile . All participant refurbish group show clinical feature anantomy , roughness and/or luster deviate ideal rat Bravo accord modify United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) criterion . New Composites Alpha value ( Replacement group ) acceptable composite ( No treatment group ) use control . The protocol approve Institutional Research Ethics Committee Dental School University Chile ( Project PRI-ODO-0207 ) . All patient sign informed-consent form complete registration form General Inclusion Criteria : - Patients 20 teeth . - Restorations functional occlusion , oppose natural tooth . - Asymptomatic restore tooth . - At least one proximal contact area neighbor tooth . - Patients older 18 year . - Patients agree signed consent form participate study . - Area outside restoration failure good condition . General Exclusion Criteria : - Patients contra-indications regular dental treatment base medical history . - Patients xerostomia individual take medication significantly decrease salivary flow . - Patients high risk caries . - Patients psychiatric physical disease , interfere oral hygiene . Treatment Group Criteria Two hundred four patient initially evaluate assigned accordance modify USPHS criteria,26 patient select base inclusion criterion least 1 Composite restoration anatomy , roughness and/or luster ( Bravo ) suitable reburbishing , another composite restoration excellent value ( Alpha ) make time ( Replacement group ) .And finally another composite pre-existing acceptable condition ( Alpha Bravo value ) act control . The patient consider statistical unit study ( n=20 ) . Restoration Assessment The quality restoration score accordance modify USPHS criterion . The Cohen Kappa inter-examiner coefficient 0.74 first year 0.87 10 year two examiner ( JM EF ) underwent calibration training exercise year . In first , second , third , fourth , fifth , tenth year , examiner independently assess restoration anatomic form , roughness , color , marginal staining , luster , secondary caries , marginal marginal adaptation , directly via tactile visual examination mouth mirror number five explorer number 23 ( Hu Friedy Mfg . Co. Inc. ) indirectly radiographic examination ( bite wing ) . A third clinician ( GM ) , also underwent calibration training exercise , make final decision difference record two examiner could reach agreement . Treatment Groups Refurbishing For group , The dentist finish occlusal , lingual facial surface defective RBC restoration medium series aluminum oxide disk ( Sof-Lex,3M ESPE ) carbide bur ( 12 30 blade , Brasseler USA , Dental Instrumentation , Savannah , Ga. ) polish afine series aluminum oxide disk ( Sof-Lex , 3M ESPE ) diamond-impregnated composite polisher ( ComposiPro Diacomp , Brasseler ) . For restoration proximal surface area affect , clinician smooth interproximal aluminum oxide finish strip ( Sof-Lex Finishing Strips , 3M ESPE ) . Replacement group Composite resins Alpha value marginal adaptation criterion use positive control make resin composite ( Filtek Supreme , 3M ESPE ) , eith rubber dam isolation adhesive system L-Pop Prompt ( 3M-ESPE ) No treatment Composite resin restoration ( Z100 , 3M ESPE ) general clinically acceptable , receive treatment .</detailed_description>
