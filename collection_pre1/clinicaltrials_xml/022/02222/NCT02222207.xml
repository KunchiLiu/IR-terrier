Secondary objective : The study also evaluate safety tolerability regorafenib eye drop . Part B ( Phase IIb ) : Primary objective : The study part B design investigate : - often regorafenib eye drop need give per day - whether use regorafenib eye drop help patient neovascular ( wet ) Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( wAMD ) see well 4 week 12 week inclusion study . Secondary objective : The study also evaluate different dosings regorafenib eye drop affect patient vision , safety tolerability .</brief_summary>
