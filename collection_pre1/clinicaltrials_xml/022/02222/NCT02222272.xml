	<brief_summary>Stem cell transplantation continue treatment option patient chronic myeloid leukaemia , despite introduction tyrosine kinase inhibitor . However , many patient receive prior therapy TKIs , include Nilotinib Dasatinib time allogeneic stem cell transplantation .

	<detailed_description>Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) clonal disorder characterize chromosomal translocation ( 9 ; 22 ) produce fusion gene encode chimeric oncoprotein , BCR- ABL . This protein harbor deregulate constitutive activate tyrosine kinase ( TK ) lead leukemogenesis [ 1 ] . Imatinib mesylate , first potent selective inhibitor BCR-ABL TK [ 2 ] become frontline therapy newly diagnose CML patient [ 3 ] . It induce haematologic cytogenetic remission stage CML , well Ph positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( Ph+ ALL ) minimal toxicity [ 4 , 5 ] . However , resistance relapse imatinib treatment increasingly report [ 6 ] complete molecular remission , measure polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) rare [ 7-9 ] . Loss response imatinib frequently associate mutation kinase domain BCR-ABL lead impair imatinib bind [ 10-12 ] . Nilotinib Dasatinib orally available kinase inhibitor overcome resistance Imatinib [ 13 - 15 ] . Recent study demonstrate efficacy safety Nilotinib Dasatinib stag imatinib resistant CML . However , long-term durability response uncertain yet , substantial toxicity encounter [ 16 ] . Major adverse event observe Nilotinib therapy cytopenia , bone marrow suppression , gastrointestinal haemorrhage , diarrhea , cardiac dysfunction , liver toxicity dermatitis [ 17-19 ] Dasatinib therapy grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia neutropenia report nearly half patient non-hematologic toxicity consist primarily diarrhea , headache , fatigue , dyspnea pleural effusion [ 20 , 21 ] . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) use mainly salvage curative therapy patient advance CML previously treat imatinib . While one study show high incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , venoocclusive disease ( VOD ) transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) [ 22 ] , study demonstrate imatinib therapy prior allogeneic SCT n't adversely affect transplantation outcome [ 23,24 ] . By contrast , previously use therapy CML include busulfan interferon alpha ( administrate less 3 month allogeneic SCT ) report increase transplant related toxicity mortality CML patient undergo allogeneic SCT [ 25 , 26 ] . The impact pre-transplant nilotinib dasatinib therapy transplant related complication , morbidity outcome mostly unknown two small case series yet report topic [ 27 , 28 ] . However , allogeneic SCT continue use salvage curative therapy CML especially case resistance kinase inhibitor patient high risk relapse , second chronic phase blast crisis [ 29 ] . In future 2nd generation TKIs may replace least part imatinib frontline therapy CML continue use imatinib resistant patient . Nevertheless , high risk patient allogeneic transplantation appear remain curative treatment option . For reason , important determine whether novel treatment compromise transplantation outcome increase transplant related complication . Research design : This non interventional prospective study regard SCT follow-up . Patients agree SCT identify EBMT database transplant physician . Transplant centre non interventional prospective study choose EBMT center transplant patient CML past 5 year . Transplant center willing participate register EBMT Leiden Office . A prospective registry keep record patient undergo allogeneic SCT receive prior treatment 2nd generation TKIs specific data collection form ( MED-B / MED-C ) send transplant centre capture relevant information appropriate interval ( day +100 ; 1 year ; 2 year ) . Data collect regard safety feasibility stem cell transplant Nilotinib Dasatinib therapy ( see endpoint ) . The data treatment patient Nilotinib Dasatinib SCT collect retrospectively part medical history ( retrospective data collection ) . Participating center plan allogeneic SCT patient CML previously treat Nilotinib Dasatinib register patient EBMT Leiden Office prior transplant ( day 0 ) . A specific MED-C form send center immediately registration . All patient transplant EBMT centre give specific consent collection release clinical data EBMT registry . Therefore , patient register non interventional prospective study would sign informed consent authorise release medical information EBMT non interventional prospective study . Each centre use standard consent form information sheet . No specific consent form envisage non interventional prospective study . Study Population : This observational non interventional prospective study use exist framework EBMT identify include patient . In 2006 560 patient CML receive allotransplant , come 800 2003 . The percentage patient transplant first chronic phase constantly increase . Currently data available many previously treat 2nd generation TKI : however assume , also number patient transplant therapy second generation TKI increase . An estimate number next three year approximately 1500 allotransplants CML do . 60 % pt ( n=900 ) would receive 2nd generation TKI . Assuming least 50 % register non interventional prospective study , expect 450 patient identify next three year . Patients response status treatment second line TKI ( e.g . stable CCyR , MCyR , resistant progress 2nd line TKI ) record allow identification subgroup . Research variable : - Patients ' feature - Centres ' feature - Initial diagnosis - Subclassification status disease start 2nd generation TKI - Response status treatment 2nd generation TKI prior SCT - TKI treatment ( dose ; duration ; response ) - Subclassification status disease HSCT - Complications - Additional therapy - Relapse progression - Last disease patient status - Donor - Transplantation - Graft manipulation - Engraftment - Comorbid condition - Preparative treatment - Graft versus Host disease - Follow Data collection : All correspondence go data centre Leiden . The data manager select centre complete study form . The data manager select centre , national registry Paris office collect data form enter MED-B specific item . The MED-C item collect enter data centre Leiden . Data analysis do centrally CLWP office . In case inconsistency second check perform research assistant/data manager CLWP .</detailed_description>
