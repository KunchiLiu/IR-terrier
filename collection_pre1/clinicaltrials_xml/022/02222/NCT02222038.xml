	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate genetic architecture Linear Localized Scleroderma ( LLS ) ( linear morphea ) whole exome sequencing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Variants Linear Localized Scleroderma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present etiology LLS unknown , genetic background suspect . Although LLS clearly classify mosaic disorder , genetics protein machinery remain understood . We go use tailor approach identify genetic factor LLS . In first phase study investigate genetic architecture LLS . WES analyze whole protein cod DNA skin sample 50 consent LLS patient . The aim identify key gene associate LLS . In second phase study subsequent functional experiment perform . Based identified candidate gene , knockdown overexpression model create relevant cell line ( fibroblast ) identify biological consequence confirm functional relevance identify genetic mutation LLS . Further protein network active LLS investigate ( proteomic analysis ) . The described basic genetic study combine functional experiment lay groundwork treatment trial provide possibly novel treatment option .</detailed_description>
