	<detailed_description>Study Protocol Effect time umbilical cord clamp anaemia 8 12 month later neurodevelopment late pre-term term infant ; facility-based randomized-controlled trial Nepal Introduction At time birth , infant still attach placenta via umbilical cord . The infant usually separate placenta clamp cord two clamp . This task take place third stage labour , period time birth infant delivery placenta . Active management third stage labour describe recent World Health Organization ( WHO ) report `` cornerstone '' obstetric midwifery practice latter part 20th century . Active management involve clinician intervening process three interrelate process : administration uterotonic drug ; early cord clamp cut ; control traction umbilical cord . Early cord clamp generally advise carry first 30 second birth , regardless whether cord pulsation cease . Due evidence show last decade , recent guideline management third stage labour longer recommend immediate cord clamping change practice question policy hospital rare . Possible beneficial adverse effect : Delayed clamp allows time transfer fetal blood placenta infant time birth . This placental transfusion provide infant additional 40 % blood volume . The amount blood return infant depend cord clamp level infant hold prior clamp . Neonatal benefit associate increase placental transfusion include high haemoglobin concentration , additional iron store less anaemia later infancy , high red blood cell flow vital organ better cardiopulmonary adaptation . Delayed cord clamp link increase incidence jaundice , severe case , could long term effect health development infant . Previous study perform principal investigator high-income country show delayed cord clamping , compare early clamping , result reduced prevalence neonatal anaemia . Furthermore delay , cord clamp improve iron status reduce prevalence iron deficiency ( ID ) 4 month age without demonstrable adverse effect . As ID infant even without anaemia associate impaired development , delay cord clamp seem benefit full term infant even region relatively low prevalence ID anaemia . Later effect anaemia development : The improved iron store four six month delay cord clamp suggests ID anaemia could reduce eight twelve month age , could show principal investigator late study , possibly due small sample size . Although ID anaemia rare ( 3-9 % ) high income country , negative impact child 's health development underestimated . As example , 15 % reduction anaemia Sweden among toddler ( 3 2,5 % ) would help 500 child annually . No randomized trial evaluate effect delay versus early cord clamp infant 6 month age low income country high prevalence iron deficiency anaemia . As anaemia associate extensive health effect , stunt , fatigue impaired neurodevelopment reduce anaemia infant urgent need global perspective . In recently publish observational study Peru , anaemia eight month age evaluate infant born hospital change regime early delayed cord clamping . The study result significant reduction anaemia 16 % ( 75 59 % ) well significant high level haemoglobin . Rationale Study Nepal : In Nepal , child age 6-17 month high anaemia prevalence ( 72-78 % ) . Approximately 50 % anaemia among preschooler contribute ID . By perform plan study country high anaemia prevalence , reduce sample size dramatically still able detect significant effect haemoglobin level neurodevelopment . Study Objective : To evaluate effect delay early cord clamp 1 . Anaemia ( haemoglobin level ) 8 12 month 2 . Ferritin 8 12 month 3 . Bilirubin 2-3 day 4 . Admission neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) special care nursery 5 . Development 12 18-24 month age . Primary outcome : The primary outcome infant haemoglobin 8 12 month age . Secondary outcome : The secondary outcome neonatal morbidity ( need phototherapy , respiratory symptom ) . Maternal postpartum haemorrhage ; effect delay early cord clamp iron status 8 12 month age ; psychomotor development 12 month age assess Ages Stages Questionnaire development evaluate The Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development 18-24 month . Methods Trial design Participants : Randomized control trial compare delay early cord clamping implement hospital . The study conduct Paropakar Maternity Women 's Hospital , Nepal . Pregnant woman eligible meet follow criterion : - Late preterm term pregnancy ( gestational age 34 41 week ) - Single pregnancy expect vaginal delivery - Mother/family give consent return follow-up 8 12 month Exclusion criterion serious congenital malformation , syndrome , congenital disease could affect outcome measure . Intervention : When delivery imminent ( expect within 10 minute ) , midwife open seal , number , opaque envelope contain treatment allocation . The intervention consist delay clamp umbilical cord ( ≥180 second delivery ) early clamp umbilical cord ( ≤60 ) . The time complete delivery baby first clamp umbilical cord measure stopwatch midwife 's assistant surveillance officer . All aspect obstetric care manage accord standard practice hospital . In group , oxytocin give mother umbilical cord clamp . All staff delivery unit train study procedure trial start . Follow-up : After delivery , baby care accord clinical routine , early breast feeding encourage . As part study , infant assess 1 6 hour midwife , record baby breast fed presence respiratory symptom ( , respiratory rate &gt; 60 breaths/minute , presence nostril flaring , grunting , intercostal retraction ) . Infants stay postnatal ward mother two three day , except well baby whose mother prefer leave hospital earlier infant require admission neonatal unit . Transcutaneous bilirubin check 24 48 hour age newborn still hospital , discharge . At 8 12 month age , infant schedule follow-up visit include blood sampling ( hemoglobin ferritin ) weight length measurement . Venous blood sampling perform . Before visit , parent ask complete three day food diary ass whether infant exclusively partially breast fed whether formula solid give . Parent assist answer Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire . If funding achieve , child wil examine The Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development , Third Edition 18-24 month age . Physicians perform neonatal examination , staff member responsible collection blood sample background data , laboratory staff perform analysis blood sample blind infant 's allocation group . Additional data collection : The follow information collect maternal healthcare record : report illness , medication , parity , weight , height , smoke habit time admission . Sample size : The sample size primary outcome eight month estimate find difference 15 % ( 70 % versus 55 % ) prevalence anaemia two randomization group power 80 % type I error rate .05 . Using Fisher 's exact-test analyze outcome data group size 176 would need . Taking account attrition rate 35 % calculate include 270 newborn group , i.e . total 540 . Ethical consideration : All research involve newborn infant small child need careful ethical consideration , mainly since subject ca n't agree whether want participate study . In particular , research immediately benefit patient need ethical consideration . The included infant healthy full-term infant undergo umbilical cord clamping , standard procedure birth . The possible benefit intervention ( delay cord clamp ) increase iron store prevent infant anaemia estimate high risk probable adverse effect , hyperbilirubinaemia . Ethical approval seek obtain Nepal Health Research Council ( June 6 , 2014 , 76/2014 ) . Written inform parental consent obtain intervention , parent withdraw study time without need explanation . Discussion Policy Implication : Reducing ID among infant important associate impaired neurodevelopment . In Sweden , ID find among 26 % 12 month old infant . With high global prevalence infant anaemia , delay cord clamp potential reduce infant anaemia thereby improve infant ' child 's health development . In crude number , reduction 10 % would mean annual reduction 60 000 infant anaemia Nepal . The trial important perform although strong indication exists effect delay cord clamp anaemia 8 12 month age , evaluate randomized trial . By propose study , outcome well safety effect analyze , result might contribute practice Nepal , also global community , particular low income country high prevalence ID anaemia .</detailed_description>
