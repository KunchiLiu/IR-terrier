	<brief_summary>Introduction Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) bleed around surface brain cause rupture aneurysm arise blood vessel . Stroke may occur approximately one third patient result narrow blood vessel around brain , follow aSAH . One theory may happen bleed around base brain damage particular cell ( neuron ) control blood flow around rest brain . These neuron may control blood flow release neurotransmitter call Acetyl Choline ( ACh ) . Our hypothesis damage neuron may prevent production ACh , cause reduced blood flow stroke left untreated . By stimulate neuron , aim investigate whether possible improve blood flow around brain ultimately prevent stroke patient follow subarachnoid haemorrhage . Donepezil , drug widely use dementia , inhibit brain 's natural break ACh . We predict increase amount Ach neuron , donepezil may improve blood flow brain , reduce chance develop stroke . Trial Protocol All patient admit St George 's hospital confirm aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage age 18 85 year old invited participate trial . The protocol design take place around patient ' aneurysm treatment , perform general anesthesia ( GA ) . Recruited participant anesthetized aneurysm treatment enter study . All trial participant Xenon CT scan GA ass brain blood flow prior treatment aneurysm . Patients randomized donepezil treatment receive load dose 20mg via feed tube immediately Xenon scan . Patients control group receive drug . All patient trial undergo repeat Xenon perfusion scan GA 3 4 hour first scan , coincides completion aneurysm treatment . Those donepezil group receive daily dose 5 mg period 21 day . All aspect care relate trial subarachnoid haemorrhage patient . Patients ( legal representative unable consent ) able decline participation trial withdraw point .</brief_summary>
