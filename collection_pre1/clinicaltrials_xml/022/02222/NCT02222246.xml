	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study improve emergency department ( ED ) pain management adult sickle cell disease . Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common genetic disorder United States , occur primarily among African Americans . Management painful episode associate SCD , refer vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) , common reason SCD patient visit ED . Currently , standard approach manage VOC pain ED widely accept use , pain management vaso-occlusive crisis person SCD different provider base research . Many time , patient come ED sickle cell pain feel receive adequate pain control . If EDs could provide efficient , effective , safe , patient-centered analgesic management , may possible improve pain management adult SCD experience VOC . Guidelines treat vaso-occlusive crisis cause sickle cell disease soon publish National Heart , Lung Blood Institute National Institutes Health . These guideline recommend patient-specific pain treatment protocol standardize pain management protocol SCD patient already pain treatment protocol design . The purpose pilot study compare two way treat vaso-occlusive pain ED adult sickle cell disease , determine large randomize controlled trial feasible require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Acute Pain Management Protocols Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In August 2012 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute release public comment `` Management Sickle Cell Disease '' evidence-based recommendation develop consensus panel expertise . Because lack empirical data , recommendation specific vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) base consensus panel expertise . Recommendations include use patient-specific protocol ( specific agent dose individual patient ) . While many attempt make implement patient-specific analgesic protocol use emergency department ( EDs ) , anecdotally , difficult implement maintain time ; practical approach development , implementation , dissemination determine . As patient-specific protocol available EDs , guideline go recommend SCD specific standard analgesic protocol . Both recommend protocol provide aggressive VOC pain management typical generic ED pain protocol . However , urgent need rigorously test NHLBI recommendation compare two approach manage VOC ED . A large randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) essential test protocol . This pilot project compare two different , evidence-based , protocols include opioid pain medicine routinely use standard care treat VOC pain ED individual SCD , collect data necessary determine large RCT feasible require . This study novel design approach develop implement patient-specific standard analgesic VOC protocol use ED , develop bundle information technology education intervention enhance protocol adoption pilot RCT , also first RCT conduct ED set compare two different ED pain management protocol SCD patient experience VOC . The study consist 3 aim : 1 . Develop implement patient specific VOC protocols patient randomized arm , 2 . Conduct pilot RCT determine necessary sample size need large RCT compare difference reduction pain score ED arrival discharge , hospitalization , clinical safety outcome , subject assign randomly either standard SCD analgesic protocol patient-specific analgesic protocol , 3 . Measure feasibility method acceptability fidelity protocols evaluate optimal recruitment retention strategy , assess ED provider perception facilitator barrier protocol use protocol adherence . The soon publish NHBLI guideline manage SCD use standard protocol modification base initial dose pain medicine patient weight . The standard protocol recommend re-assessment , re-dosing possible dose escalation , every 20-30 minute . Repeat dose patient randomize weight-based protocol , necessary , maintain provide 1 dose level increase ( 25 % ) initial dose . For patient randomized patient -specific protocol , SCD provider experience individual patient best qualified make dosing frequency recommendation base upon dos require past ED hospital visit treatment VOC , daily opioid use applicable . There set maximum dose patient randomize patient-specific protocol . Both patient-specific standard protocol available ED via patient 's electronic medical record . Upon ED arrival , provider retrieve patient 's study protocol ( patient-specific , standard ) include start agent , dos , subsequent analgesic recommendation , order medication accord pre-determined protocol . The study conduct emergency department University Cincinnati Medical Center Mt . Sinai Hospital New York . Patients enrol study 12-months , may contribute five different ED visit VOC pain control enrollment allow large number different patient . Study outcomes compare ED visit patient randomized patient-specific vs. standard SCD protocol . The primary outcome difference pain score ED arrival discharge , 6 hour , measure use visual analogue scale . The trajectory average pain score immediately prior administration 1st analgesic dose discharge 30 minute increment treatment group also calculate .</detailed_description>
