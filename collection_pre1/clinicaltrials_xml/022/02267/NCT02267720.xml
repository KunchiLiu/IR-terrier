	<brief_title>Occlusal-proximal ART Restorations Primary Molars Using 2 Different Kinds GIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sampling procedure : This study approve research ethic committee School Dentistry ( University São Paulo , Brazil ) write informed consent obtain parent legal guardian participate child . The sample size calculate base minimum difference 10 % success rate control treatment group 1 year follow-up , α 5 % power ( strength ) 80 % use paired test . According sample size calculation 150 child age 5-8 year old attend public school city Barueri state São Paulo , Brazil select . To include study follow criterion must follow : healthy , cooperative child least one occlusal carious lesion primary molar extend dentin dimension great 2 mm occluso-cervical intact edge list . Also , include tooth present ulcer , abscess , fistula , pathological mobility . Implementation : One occlusal restoration per child include study . If select child present cavity , refer health centre municipality Barueri treat operator research training week . All occlusal proximal-ART restoration perform two operator school premisses3 . The operator final year dental student previously train perform ART mix GIC accord manufacturer ' protocol . Additionally , try-out week include give operator opportunity familiarise local condition prior start operative phase study . The operator assist local dentist dentist assistant , previously train mix GIC accord manufacturer ' protocol . The child randomly assign three group : Fuji IX , Maxxion R , Vitro Molar GIC brand use child assign random list . The operator blind GIC brand . Treatment procedure : The ART technique perform accord ART guideline propose Frencken ( 2014 ) 8 . No local anaesthesia use treatment . The plaque remove enamel hatchet use make access underlie softened dentine . Infected carious dentin remove hand instrument . The use hand instrument dentin surface result smear layer need remove use dentine conditioner . The liquid component hand-mixed powder-liquid GIC , contain acid component , use saliva isolation do cotton wool roll . The cavity restore one three GIC brand : Fuji IX ( GC Europe , Leuven , BE ) , Maxxion R ( FGM , Rio de Janeiro , BR ) Vitro Molar ( DHL , Rio de Janeiro , BR ) . The GICs hand mix accord manufacturers´ instruction ( powder/liquid ratio 1:1 ) insert cavity conventional application instrument . A thin layer petroleum jelly rub index finger restoration press 20 second . The material include seal pit fissure . After prepare balanced occlusion , new layer petroleum jelly apply GIC restoration17 . The amount GIC use , element number , cavity dimension dmft record . The duration restorative procedure record stop watch . The participate child instruct eat one hour restoration place . Estimation cost-effectiveness : Effectiveness measure term retention rate . This study report preliminary result 1 month , follow-ups do every 6 month 3 year . The average cost per restoration estimate . Costs equipment , autoclave hand instrument , disposable ( hand glove , face mask , cotton wool roll ) , articulate paper petroleum jelly used restoration equal three GIC group exclude . There labour cost operator . The material cost ( powder-liquid GICs ) estimate per restoration . Evaluation : The retention rate restoration evaluate 1 month accord modify version Roeleveld et al . ( 2006 ) criterion ( Table 1 ) . A restoration consider 'failure ' defect filling , secondary caries observe , restoration present pulp inflame . When restoration still present slight defect observe , consider 'success ' . When tooth unavailable evaluation , censor . All evaluation carry one independent evaluator , restore cavity , train calibrate benchmark . The cost effectiveness evaluate . The total price GIC brand , use insert cavity compare retention rate restorations9 .</detailed_description>
