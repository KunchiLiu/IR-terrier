	<brief_summary>The aim cohort study precisely measure patient ' exposure gonadal radiation orthopaedic trauma surgery involve acetabulum , pelvis , hip , femur , apply finding previously describe validated formula determine increase risk future adverse health effect reproductive organ . The investigator null hypothesis standard care use x-ray fluoroscopy treatment pelvis , hip , femur fracture expose patient significant gonadal radiation load . Analysis patient ' intraoperative radiation dos mean previously validate formula display significantly increase risk adverse health event reproductive organ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gonadal Radiation Exposure Risk Secondary Fluoroscopic Imaging During Trauma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , physicians treat one half million fracture pelvis , hip , femur year.1-3 Exposure patient ionize radiation diagnosis treatment injury unfortunate reality standard care . Regulations put forth US National Radiation Committee ( USNRC ) include limit maximum radiation exposure , background level , individual member public less 1 millisievert ( mSv ) per year.4 While current recommendation exist regard medical exposure patient , physician expect display judicious practice diagnostic therapeutic procedure patient expose ionize radiation.4 Nevertheless , patient undergo trauma activation expose radiation level significant possibly excessive 25 32 mSv admission.5,6 The probability radiation exposure may reduce support previous study , establish 60 % surgical trainee take account risk radiation patient train intraoperative fluoroscopy technique decrease patient exposure 50 % , maintain equivalent result.7,8 Few previous study address patient exposure radiation operative treatment orthopaedic injuries.5,9,10 Previous research document radiation dose surgery pelvis femur use fluoroscope-calculated dose area product ( DAP ) , less accurate direct dosimetry propose study.11-13 Furthermore , prior study inappropriately determine stochastic risk linear no-threshold ( LNT ) model , accord USNRC , provide limited statistical power epidemiologically base conclusion overestimate risk comparatively low dos see trauma patients.14,15 Using accurate previously validate model , stochastic effect exposure reproductive organ calculate precise level provide previous studies.15,16 The investigator hope research would allow orthopaedic community accurately express risk intraoperative radiation patient , support improved training fluoroscopic technique promote development less fluoroscopic dependent fixation technique .</detailed_description>
