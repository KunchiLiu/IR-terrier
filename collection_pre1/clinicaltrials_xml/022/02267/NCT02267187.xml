	<detailed_description>Clinical use autologous fat graft human describe early 1893 , Neuber publish report transfer multiple small particle fat fill soft tissue depression . Over past three decade , autologous fat graft become common procedure clinical plastic surgery , also employ clinician specialty . The refinement liposuction technique 1980 's make possible harvest adipose graft low risk without need significant incision . The liposuction aspirate could simply reinjected different site . Specialized equipment develop fat graft commercially available number source . The American Society Plastic Surgeons 2007 procedural statistic show 65,000 fat grafting procedure perform United States ( www.plasticsurgery.org ) previous year . Fat grafting may represent superior method facial reconstruction severe trauma , result impact resorption fat volume time . The specific aim study : 1 . Assess facial appearance soft tissue volume autologous fat graft use CT scan 3D photography . 2 . Assess cellular property cell within fat graft 3 . Comparison cotton roll centrifugation method autologous fat graft 4 . Measure quality life patient autologous fat graft use validated psychosocial measure . Ten ( 10 ) subject 18 year age old enrol trial .</detailed_description>
