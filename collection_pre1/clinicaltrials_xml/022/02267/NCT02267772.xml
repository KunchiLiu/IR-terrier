	<brief_summary>Purpose : To determine IV acetaminophen 1 ) decrease pain pregnancy woman , 2 ) reduce amount opioid use pregnant woman encounter pain , 3 ) reduce maternal fetal adverse effect compare opioids . Design : This comparative effective trial randomize , control trial IV acetaminophen vs. IV morphine pregnant woman . Procedures : Women meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize IV acetaminophen IV morphine . The IV acetaminophen group get four standard dos IV acetaminophen stay hospital .

	<detailed_description>Rationale clinical trial The goal analgesia pregnancy reduce pain minimize maternal fetal adverse effect . Current opioids use pregnancy provide minimal pain relief associate adverse effect . IV acetaminophen show significantly improve pain control follow cesarean section first stage labor . Moreover , IV acetaminophen reduces need consumption opioids follow surgery . If IV acetaminophen effective control pain associate maternal medical condition uterine contraction labor , use parenteral opiods pregnant woman exposure fetus could reduce . This could provide new opportunity medical management pain pregnancy . Thus propose comparative effectiveness trial IV acetaminophen compare IV morphine . Hypothesis : We hypothesize IV acetaminophen effective IV morphine reduce pain pregnant woman . In , IV acetaminophen reduce amount narcotic need woman pain . Objectives : To determine IV acetaminophen : 1 . Decrease pain pregnant woman 2 . Reduce amount opioid use pregnant woman encounter pain 3 . Reduce maternal fetal adverse effect compare opioids Study Design : For comparative effective trial , propose randomize , control trial IV acetaminophen vs. IV morphine pregnant woman . Prior study confirm IV acetaminophen effective control pain compare placebo . [ 14,20 ] Thus , administer placebo pain control justified time . We include 3 different group pregnant population encounter pain different reason . Group 1 : Pregnant woman uterine contraction , labor Group 2 : Pregnant woman uterine contraction first stage labor Group 3 : Pregnant woman medical condition associate pain .</detailed_description>
