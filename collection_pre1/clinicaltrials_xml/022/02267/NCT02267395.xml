	<brief_title>Scapular Cervical Neuromuscular Control Deficits Musicians With Without Playing Injuries .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The art professionally play musical instrument physically demand . Such activity involve maintain static posture produce repetitive motion countless hour play time practice performance , often little rest . More 50 % musician develop upper extremity injury pain related instrument use , negatively affect interrupt career . Efficient cervical spine shoulder girdle neuromuscular control essential upper quarter musculoskeletal injury prevention . Neuromuscular control deficit link high upper extremity occupational injury incidence profession . However , research date investigate difference scapular cervical endurance neuromuscular control musician without playing-related cervical upper extremity musculoskeletal disorder . Design : Case-control study Setting : Musical venue university set . Participants : Eighty subject include student musician different university professional musician Tennessee . Methods : Musicians consecutively recruit fill questionnaire regard presence cervical upper extremity PRMSDs . Those subject PRMSDs ( Yes-PRMSDs ) undergo clinical test presence scapular dyskinesis cervical neuromuscular control endurance deficit use follow test : ( 1 ) cranio-cervical flexion test ; ( 2 ) scapular dyskinesis test ; ( 3 ) deep neck flexor endurance test . Asymptomatic musician ( No-PRMSDs ) recruit consecutively , match gender , type instrument ( string instrument ) number hour play per week test follow protocol . Reliability test : To determine intrarater reliability prior data collection , convenience sample twenty subject include study evaluate two day ( 1 ) Cranio-cervical flexion test ; ( 2 ) Scapular dyskinesis test ; ( 3 ) deep neck flexor endurance test . Tests repeat least 24-hour interval testing session . Intra-class correlation coefficient ( model 3 , 2 ) two cervical test Kappa statistic model scapular dyskinesis test calculate determination intrarater reliability . Interventions : Subjects complete comprehensive demographic questionnaire include play pattern , well general health related question fitness activity exposure . In second visit , subject group complete test battery include cranio-cervical flexion test , scapular dyskinesis assessment deep neck flexor endurance test . Blinding assessor group subject member ( Yes-PRMSDs versus No-PRMSDs ) ensure . Purpose : The purpose research investigate difference presence : ( 1 ) prior injury , play pattern , physical fitness habit ; ( 2 ) scapular dyskinesis ; ( 3 ) cervical neuromuscular control endurance deficit musician without play related musculoskeletal Disorders ( PRMSDs )</detailed_description>
