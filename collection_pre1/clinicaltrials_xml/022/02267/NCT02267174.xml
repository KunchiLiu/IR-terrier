	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Operating room intensive care unit handoffs high-risk event critically ill patient . Studies select patient population show standardize operating room intensive care unit handoffs improve information exchange decrease error . To adapt finding mixed surgical population , investigator propose study implementation standardize operating room intensive care unit handoff process two intensive care unit currently without exist standard process . METHODS/DESIGN : The Handoffs Transitions Critical Care ( HATRICC ) study hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial operating room intensive care unit handoff . The investigator use mixed method conduct needs assessment current handoff process , adapt publish handoff process , implement new standardize handoff process two academic intensive care unit . Needs assessment - The investigator use nonparticipant observation observe current handoff process . Focus group , interview , survey clinician elicit participant ' impression current process . Adaptation implementation - The investigator adapt publish standardized handoff process use need assessment finding . The investigator use small group simulation test new process ' feasibility . After simulation , investigator incorporate new handoff process clinical work provider study unit . Evaluation - Using method employ need assessment phase , investigator evaluate use new handoff process . Data analysis - The primary effectiveness outcome number information omission per handoff episode compare pre-intervention period . Additional intervention outcome include patient intensive care unit length stay intensive care unit mortality . The primary implementation outcome acceptability new process . Additional implementation outcome include feasibility , fidelity sustainability . DISCUSSION : The HATRICC study examine effectiveness implementation standardize operating room intensive care unit handoff process . Findings study potential improve healthcare communication outcome critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
