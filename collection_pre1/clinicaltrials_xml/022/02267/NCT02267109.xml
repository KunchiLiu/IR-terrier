	<brief_summary>Ebola virus cause infection know Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . This generally severe disease also lead death . The 2014 outbreak EVD West Africa large ever . Researchers want develop vaccine prevent Ebola infection . It impossible someone get Ebola infection vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial Ebola Vaccine Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b ( 1b implies trial occur geographic region case disease vaccine direct , i.e . Ebola disease , may occur , clinical trial ) , open label , dose-escalation study examine safety , tolerability immunogenicity investigational Ebola virus vaccine , cAD3-EB ) Z , Malian healthy adult . The vaccine recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus Type-3 vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine ( cAd3-EBO Z ) consist recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus chimpanzee serotype 3 ( cAd3 ) vector express wild-type ( WT ) Ebola glycoprotein ( GP ) Zaire strain . A revision protocol 14Dec2014 add booster dose MVA-BN® Filo placebo 56 subject group 1 ( except first 5 vaccine ) , 2 , 3A 4 . The multivalent vectored vaccine MVA-BN® Filo contain insert Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein , well Sudan strain Ebola virus glycoprotein , Musoke strain Marburg virus glycoprotein , nucleoprotein Tai-Forest Ebola virus . Forty volunteer enrol two dosage group . Another group 40 volunteer ( Groups 3A-C ) group 3A receive 1.0x10 ( 10 ) vp . All study participant receive one dose study vaccine intramuscular injection . Group 4 add include another 11 volunteer receive 1.-X10 ( 11 ) vp . A total 91 volunteer include . Group 1 include 20 participant receive low dose vaccine 2.5 x 10 ( 10 ) vp Group 2 include 20 participant receive high vaccine 5 x 10 ( 10 ) vp . Group 3A include 10 participant receive 1.0X10 ( 10 ) vp Group 3B include 15 participant receive 2.5X10 ( 10 ) vp Group 3C include 15 participant receive 5X10 ( 10 ) vp ( participant randomly allocate Group 3B 3C ) Group 4 include 11 participant receive1x10 ( 11 ) vp . The goal vaccinate group see add benefit immunogenicity vaccine use high dose . This dosage level monovalent vaccine already study VRC/NIH September CVD Baltimore month November . This dosage level study Oxford Bamako . Having data West African subject give dosage helpful design final formulation field trial Q1 2015 . The decision make base three set data : clinical dose-response ; immunologic dose-response ( proxy expect protection ) ; manufacture yield cost good consideration . For safety reason , first Malian volunteer receive vaccine dose Group 1 vaccinate alone wait 24 hour vaccinate subsequent volunteer dose group . Two Group 1 volunteer may vaccinate 24 hour first , least another 24 hour gap leave vaccinating subject receive dose vaccine . After 5 volunteer Group 1 vaccinate follow 7 day , interim safety review ( ISR1 ) perform DSMB . Enrollment rest group may proceed DSMB ass data indicates safe . Group 2 volunteer vaccinate without stepwise procedure . This decision make DSMB review safety data 5X10 ( 10 ) UK trial approval Institutional Review Boards . Group 3A , receive low dosage level Groups 1 2 , vaccinate soon logistically possible subject Group 2 vaccinate . Groups 3B Group 3C similarly vaccinated period three day rate 10 subject per day . Group 4 vaccinate additional 11 participant 1X10 ( 11 ) vaccinate 2 day ( 5 subject one day follow another 6 subject next day . Heterologous boost dose MVA-BN® Filo placebo 56 subject group 1 ( except first 5 vaccinee ) , 2 , 3A 4 commence January 2015 random allocation either vaccine placebo .</detailed_description>
