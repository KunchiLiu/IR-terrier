	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Merkel Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) first systemic intervention patient advance Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity MK-3475 first systemic intervention patient advance MCC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine immune correlate clinical activity MK-3475 . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression* unacceptable toxicity . * NOTE : Patients confirm disease progression may continue receive treatment otherwise clinically stable increase tumor burden 25 % follow initial confirmation progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 9-12 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
