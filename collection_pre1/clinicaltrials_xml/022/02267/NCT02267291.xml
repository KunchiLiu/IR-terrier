	<brief_summary>Cardiologists intensive care specialist confront daily mechanically ventilated patient exhibit cardiac failure . It paramount importance understand effect mechanical ventilation cardiac function interpret echocardiographic finding correctly order provide patient best possible treatment support cardiac circulatory function . Currently physicians interpret echocardiographic finding base study perform spontaneously breathe patient . With study , investigator intend contribute understanding cardiac physiology patient need ventilatory support , especially aim provide physiological basis interpretation echocardiographic finding order improve medical support ( e.g . fluid resuscitation , vasoactive drug , ventilation strategy ) ventilate patient impaired cardiovascular function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) commonly use intensive care unit ( ICU ) improve gas exchange reduce breathe effort . The need MV single prominent reason admission intensive care unit , either acute cardiac respiratory failure , postoperative ventilation reason . Its usefulness limit critically ill patient also gain recognition treat sleep-related breathing disorder . Soon introduction MV clinical practice adverse hemodynamic effect note study ever since . It well accept MV , apply external positive pressure order achieve tidal breathing , affect lung volume intrathoracic pressure turn influence cardiac loading function . Echocardiography increasingly use intensive care evaluate hemodynamics especially Doppler assessment mitral inflow annular tissue velocity describe leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function . There grow body evidence state diastolic dysfunction key factor wean failure MV , clinical issue affect one third patient . Worsened diastolic LV fill MV may decisively lower cardiac performance cause hemodynamic instability especially case pre-existing diastolic dysfunction patient arterial hypertension , disease high prevalence 30-45 % general population . So far , despite extensive use echocardiography ventilate patient , causative pathophysiological mechanism underlie ventilation-induced change echocardiographic parameter use determine diastolic LV function never thoroughly evaluate . Assessing diastolic function MV complex since Doppler derive surrogate parameter depend cardiac loading condition load inevitably couple MV . The question therefore arise whether echocardiography allow detection deteriorate LV diastolic function term impair intrinsic ventricular relaxation LV stiffness whether primarily mirror MV-induced loading alteration . It important differentiate echocardiographic sign diastolic dysfunction patient MV cause change load LV fill restraint since case hemodynamic instability two scenario would ask different therapeutic measure . In case loading problem , pre- afterload target use drug fluid resuscitation . If MV-induced filling restraint predominant problem one may consider special ventilatory mode even deep sedation use muscle relaxant minimize Pit . The basic concept heart-lung interaction positive pressure ventilation make conceivable extrinsic pressure apply thorax therefore , explain later detail , heart may mimic diastolic dysfunction even totally healthy heart assess echocardiography . Echocardiographic parameter assess diastolic function evaluate gold standard - invasive LV pressure volume measurement - spontaneously breathe patient . Such evaluation lack patient ventilatory support therefore value echocardiography assessment diastolic function MV need clarification . The investigator intend comparatively study cardiac particularly leave ventricular diastolic function ventilate patient use invasive ultrasound method . Objective The present study elucidate influence positive pressure ventilation cardiac function human . Furthermore , investigator aim describe change echocardiographic parameter different level positive pressure ventilation link change underlie pathophysiological alteration hemodynamics induce positive pressure ventilation . Methods Prospective single-centre study University Hospital Berne . 30 patient schedule elective coronary angiogram include . During spontaneous breathe two different level non-invasive PPV transthoracic echocardiography perform record LV-pressure-volume loop use impedance catheter . Simultaneously pulmonary artery occlusion pressure , right atrial pressure intrathoracic pressure record use pulmonary artery catheter oesophageal balloon respectively .</detailed_description>
