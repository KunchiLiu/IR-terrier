	<detailed_description>Although abstinence tobacco remain best method lung cancer prevention , recent evidence National Lung Screening Trial indicate lung cancer mortality reduce 20 % spiral compute tomography ( CT ) compare chest X-ray . As result , United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend lung cancer screen high risk individual ( long-term current former smoker , 55-80 year old ) . It estimate 8 million people US high risk lung screening could prevent 12,000 death annually . Cost effectiveness model suggest concurrent smoking cessation program essential order realize full benefit screening . However , clinical guideline evidence-based cessation protocol demonstrate effectiveness setting . The investigator propose address gap rigorously test whether two scalable pragmatic intervention ( minimal moderate intensity ) significantly boost intention quit cessation rate . The investigator capitalize critical 'teachable moment ' learn one 's screen result . Incorporation individual 's screen result cessation intervention test innovative question whether intention quit enhance reduced intention quit minimize , individualize , motivational telephone-based intervention provide . Method : The investigator accrue current smoker lung cancer screening program three site : Georgetown University Hospital , Lahey Hospital , Hackensack University Hospital . Prior screening , 100 participant consent , enrol , complete baseline ( T0 ) phone interview . Within 1-2 day receive result , participant randomly assign Minimal Treatment ( MT ) vs. Telephone Counseling ( TC ) . Both arm receive minimal treatment intervention ( list print , online , quitline , in-person cessation resource ) . The TC arm receive 3-6 session stepped-care , proactive , telephone counsel Tobacco Treatment Specialist site . Both arm assess 3-months post randomization tobacco use outcome . The specific aim : 1 ) To conduct two-arm randomized cessation intervention trial ( MT vs. TC ) current smoker undergo screening . 2 ) The investigator explore moderator mediator intervention ' effect cessation outcome . Moderators include screen result , race , gender , age , nicotine dependence . Mediators include teachable moment factor , baseline intention quit , process measure . Summary : This proof concept study determine intervention feasibility , effect size need large study , potential moderator mediator intervention . The long-term goal evaluate intervention multisite trial ultimately , disseminate use lung cancer screen program . The innovation proposal join disease prevention ( smoke cessation ) early detection medical set relevance substantial proportion current smoker , suggest even small increase cessation potential large public health benefit .</detailed_description>
