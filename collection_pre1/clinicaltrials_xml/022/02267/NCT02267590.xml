	<brief_title>Tissue Collection Biomarkers Determining Resistance Ibrutinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With recent FDA approval Ibrutinib management relapsed/refractory MCL CLL , enter excite phase management condition . A crucial next step validate biomarkers predict clinical activity Ibrutinib order tailor therapy maximise benefit patient . The recently open name patient supply ( NPS ) ibrutinib UK provide excellent window opportunity study . The investigator set collaboration Professor Simon Rule ( Plymouth ) Dr George Follows ( Cambridge ) , carry prospective data collection study patient enter NPS . With help collaborator investigator able identify centre NHS collection sample . Patients enter NPS provide information sheet research specific consent form follow sample consent patient transfer Royal Marsden Hospital ( RMH ) storage . Samples log tracked use secure database . Samples research collect time routine sample therefore additional sampling require . For patient , consent obtain pretreatment , progression well diagnostic sample take stored patient require study least 24 month start treatment . The collection end 24 month last patient commences treatment NPS . Once idea number patient sample collect , second stage study initiate involve molecular screening sample RMH biomarkers resistance . The data molecular study correlate clinical response data collaborator clinical validation .</detailed_description>
