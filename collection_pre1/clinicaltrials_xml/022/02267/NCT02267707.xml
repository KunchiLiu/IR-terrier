	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Safety Study Nab®-Paclitaxel ( ABI-007 ) Plus Gemcitabine Subjects With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Who Have Cholestatic Hyperbilirubinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 2 treatment cohort study base predose total bilirubin level Cycle 1 Day 1 ( Cohort 1 &gt; 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal [ ULN ] 3 x ULN bilirubin Cohort 2 &gt; 3 x ULN 5 x ULN ) . Enrollment subject Cohort 2 proceed review safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data subject Cohort 1 complete Safety Monitoring Committee . The study follow 3+3 dose escalation scheme within dose level cohort group . A total 3 subject initially enrol start dose level cohort . The dose study regimen cohort escalate ( reduce ) accord tolerability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject definitive histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( islet cell neoplasms exclude ) measurable RECIST Version 1.1 guideline . 2 . Initial diagnosis advance stage disease must occur ≤ 6 week prior start Cycle 1 Day 1 . NOTE : The clock time interval start date last evaluation confirm advanced disease ( either biopsy imaging result ) . 3 . Subject confirm cholestatic hyperbilirubenemia due bile duct obstruction . Subjects liver dysfunction due metastasis alone exclude . 4 . Subject must receive prior therapy treatment metastatic disease . Prior treatment 5FU gemcitabine administer radiation sensitizer 4 week radiation therapy allow . If subject receive gemcitabine adjuvant setting , tumor recurrence must occur least 6 month complete last dose gemcitabine . 5 . For patient biliary stent insert , 2 stable bilirubin reading within 48 72 hour take least 5 day 14 day poststenting must obtain . In addition , complication ( eg , infection ) present bilirubin level stabilize ( 2 reading total bilirubin within 20 % ) administer first treatment . 6 . Males females ≥ 18 year age time sign informed consent document ( ICD ) . 7 . Subject adequate biological parameter demonstrate follow blood count screen ( obtain ≤ 14 day prior start Cycle 1 Day 1 ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 ( 1.5 × 109/L ) cells/mm3 ; Platelet count ≥ 100,000 ( 100 × 109/L ) cells/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL . 8 . Subject follow blood chemistry level screen ( obtain ≤ 14 day prior start Cycle 1 Day 1 ) : AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 × ULN allow : Serum creatinine within normal limit calculate clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject serum creatinine level institutional normal value . If use creatinine clearance , actual body weight used calculate creatinine clearance ( eg , use CockroftGault formula ) . For subject body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 kg/m2 , lean body weight use instead . 9 . Subject acceptable coagulation study ( obtain ≤ 14 day prior start Cycle 1 Day 1 ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.2 x ULN INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN . 10 . Subject clinically significant abnormality urinalysis result ( obtained ≤ 14 day prior start Cycle 1 Day 1 ) . 11 . Subject Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % . 12 . Significant symptomatic amount ascites drain prior Cycle 1 Day 1 . Pain symptom stable require modification analgesic management prior Cycle 1 Day 1 . 13 . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) ( define sexually mature woman ( 1 ) undergone hysterectomy [ surgical removal uterus ] bilateral oophorectomy [ surgical removal ovary ] ( 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month [ i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ] ) must : 1 . Either commit true abstinence* heterosexual contact ( must review monthly basis ) , agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption , 28 day prior start IP therapy ( include dose interruption ) , study medication longer period require local regulation follow last dose IP ; 2 . Have negative serum pregnancy test ( β hCG ) result screen agree ongoing pregnancy test course study , end study therapy . This apply even subject practice true abstinence* heterosexual contact . 14 . Male subject must practice true abstinence* agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential participating study , dose interruption 6 month follow IP discontinuation , even undergone successful vasectomy . * True abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Note : Periodic abstinence ( e.g , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 15 . Understand voluntarily sign informed consent document prior study related assessments/procedures conduct . 16 . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 1 . Subject know brain metastasis . 2 . Any active malignancy . Any previous malignancy allow provide tumor curatively resect evidence recurrence within 12 month prior enrolment study . In addition , adequately treat insitu carcinoma cervix , uteri , nonmelanonatous skin cancer allow provide treatment complete 6 month prior enrollment . 3 . Subject active , uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection ( ) require systemic therapy . 4 . Subject known historical active infection HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , hepatitis B , hepatitis C subject receive immunosuppressive myelosuppressive medication would , opinion Investigator , increase risk serious neutropenic complication . 5 . Subject undergone major surgery reason , diagnostic surgery ( ie , surgery do obtain biopsy diagnosis without removal organ ) , within 4 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 treatment study . 6 . Subject history myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina pectoris , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IIIIV heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , seizure disorder clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , within 6 month prior Cycle 1 Day 1 . 7 . Subject history allergy hypersensitivity nabpaclitaxel gemcitabine excipients . 8 . Subject uses medication know strong inducer CYP3A4 CYP2C8 ( Section 9.2 ) . 9 . History connective tissue disorder ( eg , lupus , scleroderma , arteritis nodosa ) . 10 . Subjects history interstitial lung disease , history slowly progressive dyspnea unproductive cough , sarcoidosis , silicosis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis multiple allergy . 11 . History chronic leukemia ( eg , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) . 12 . Subject enrol clinical protocol investigational trial interventional agent assessment may interfere study procedure . 13 . Subject unwilling unable comply study procedure . 14 . Any significant medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject participate study . 15 . Any condition include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study . 16 . Any condition confound ability interpret data study .</criteria>
