	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluating Efficacy Safety AbGn-168H Patients With Active Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , multi-dose phase II proof principle trial study efficacy safety AbGn-168H patient moderate severe active psoriatic arthritis . A minimum 15 patient maximum 20 recruit 1 dose group . For safety evaluation , parameter assess include physical examination , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate body temperature ) , 12-lead ECG , safety laboratory test , adverse event tolerability . For efficacy evaluation , patient evaluate proportion subject reach American College Rheumatology 20 ( ACR 20 ) week 12 proportion subject reach ACR 20 , ACR 50 ACR 70 different time point ; Disease Activity Score 28 ( DAS28 ) different time point , well Target Lesion Psoriasis Severity Score ( TLPSS ) static Physician Global Assessment ( sPGA ) subject active skin lesion different time point .</detailed_description>

Permanent sterilization method include hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state define menses 12 month without alternative medical cause . A high follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal range may use confirm postmenopausal state woman use hormonal contraception hormonal replacement therapy . However absence 12 month amenorrhea , single FSH measurement insufficient . A man consider fertile puberty unless permanently sterile bilateral orchidectomy . A highly effective method birth control define one result low failure rate ( le 1 % per year ) . Exclusion criteria 1 . History malignancy past 5 year suspicion active malignant disease . 2 . Evidence current previous clinically significant disease , medical condition psoriatic arthritis , find medical examination ( include vital sign ECG ) , opinion Investigator , would compromise safety patient quality data . This criterion provide opportunity investigator exclude patient base clinical judgment , even eligibility criterion satisfy . 3 .
