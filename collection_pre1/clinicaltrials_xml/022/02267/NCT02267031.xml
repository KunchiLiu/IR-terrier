	<brief_summary>Abdominal surgery commonly require perioperative relaxation therefore control mechanical ventilation . However , respiratory support associate minor , yet clinically significant change blood gas content . The inadvertent hyperoxia ( excessively high oxygen ) and/or hypocapnia ( excessively low carbon dioxide ) result transient change cerebral blood flow cognitive impair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Perioperative Ventilation ( Gas Exchange ) During Intrabdominal Surgery Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The moderate hyperventilation result hypocapnia well hyperoxia common feature mechanical ventilation general anesthesia . While mild hyperventilation routinely advocate laparoscopic surgical intervention , increase FiO2 set reinforce safety respiratory support . Hypocapnia may cause disturbance cerebral blood flow due narrow cerebral vessel decrease cerebral blood flow . Hypocapnia particularly injurious brain premature infant . Factors may predispose immature brain injury include poorly develop vascular supply vulnerable area , antioxidant depletion excitatory amino acid , lipopolysaccharide cytokine effect potentiate destruction white matter . Data neonates clearly suggest severe hypocapnia hyperventilation contribute adverse neurologic outcome . The use high concentration oxygen lead number event formation harmful free radical activation lipid peroxidation , result secondary brain injury due hyperoxia , particularly suffer anoxia brain resuscitate victim sudden cardiac arrest . It recommend use fraction oxygen maintain saturation level 94-98 % perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , due risk reperfusion injury . These disturbance gas exchange , yet transient interfere cerebral blood flow therefore mental function . The primary aim study assessment impact intraoperative gas exchange ( hypocapnia , hyperoxia combination ) state higher nervous activity</detailed_description>
