	<detailed_description>The study population patient low- intermediate-grade ( G1 G2 ) advance NET fail standard treatment unable receive standard treatment.Sulfatinib 300 mg day ( QD ) orally administrate 28-day cycle . Investigators evaluate clinical tumor response Sulfatinib , investigator determine patient benefit continuation treatment , patient continue Sulfatinib treatment . The duration study 2 year . At time study completion , investigator believe patient continue benefit investigational product , patient may provide Sulfatinib agreement sponsor .</detailed_description>
