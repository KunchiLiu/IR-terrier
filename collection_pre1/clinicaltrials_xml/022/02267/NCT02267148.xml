	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common disorder , affect ~30 % people general population 96 % obese individual . Variations several gene find associate fatty liver , association explain small percentage risk , study need . In many case NAFLD cause serious side effect , individual progress scar harden liver , liver failure , cancer . The purpose research study determine individual carry certain genetic variation gene relate bile choline metabolism increase risk fatty liver progress fibrosis , scar liver . This study also use new , non-invasive method call FibroScan® measure liver fat liver stiffness . The FibroScan® device FDA approve use measure liver stiffness , liver fat measurement . However , FibroScan® instrument consider non-significant risk device . Since induction Europe worldwide 2003 , adverse effect report device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilizing Non-Invasive Fibroscan® Technology Identify Genetic Markers Fatty Liver Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : ABCB4 gene intersects choline bile metabolism , two process highly relevant liver disease . The investigator identify pattern genetic variation associate fatty liver burden potentially , risk liver disease . One prominent gene pattern ABCB4 . This data need replicate general population . This study test hypothesis aberrant function ABCB4 due genetic variation increase risk fatty liver progression fibrosis . It also implement innovative , non-invasive technology measure liver fat fibrosis utilize FibroScan® instrument . As additional proof principle measurement make correlate genetics , investigator also measure two genetic variant show many study correlate liver fat fibrosis research team others : PNPLA3 rs738409 rs2281135 . Finally , investigator calculate NAFLD-Fibrosis score additional correlate liver disease status . Participants : To test hypothesis , 50 ethnically diverse , overweight obese male female adult recruit general population . Procedures : Genotyping correlate variation ABCB4 PNPLA3 gene level fatty liver progression fibrosis FibroScan® . Calculation NAFLD-Fibrosis score .</detailed_description>
