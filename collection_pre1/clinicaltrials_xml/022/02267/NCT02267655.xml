	<detailed_description>This exploratory , two-part , clinical study evaluate utility HRCT measure pharmacodynamic effect short term , pulse administration iNO use combination product , inhaled nitric oxide/INOpulse subject PH associate COPD LTOT . The utility HRCT characterize effect iNO pulmonary imaging parameter function ) short term inhale iNO administration b ) NO cylinder concentration study . In study , pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) define tricuspid regurgitation velocity ( TRV ) ≥ 2.9 meters/second ( m/s ) sPAP ≥ 38 mmHg 2-D echocardiogram Doppler mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) ≥ 25 mmHg right heart catheterization . Eleven subject enrol ; first 6 subject enrol assigned Part 1 , next 2 subject enrol assigned Part 2 . After Part 1 complete result review Sponsor , next 4 subject enrol Part 2 . The Next three subject participate Part 3 . In Part 1 , six ( 6 ) subject adequate kidney function randomize receive 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr dose iNO use cylinder concentration 4880 ppm ( 6.0 mg/L ) . The 2 subject enrol Part 2a randomly assign 1 2 sequence ( 2 subjects/sequence ) receive iNO utilizing NO cylinder concentration ( 4880 ppm ) dose 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr Placebo set dose 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr . The 2 patient Part 2a enter Part 2b . During Part 2b patient receive iNO utilize NO cylinder concentration ( 4880 ppm ) dose 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr ( INOpulse® set 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr ) 4 week least 12 hours/day . The 3 subject enrol Part 3a 3b . Part 3a dose titration visit , Part 3 4 week treatment dose identify Paret 3a discretion Investigator . Part 3a : subject receive three different dos iNO utilize NO cylinder concentration ( 4880ppm ) dose 5 , 10 15 mcg/kg IBW/hr . The 3 patient Part 3a enter Part 3b administer open label iNO 4 weeks/at least 12 hrs/day dose determine Investigator Part 3a . Subjects replace unable complete treatment visit evaluable HRCT data obtain .</detailed_description>
