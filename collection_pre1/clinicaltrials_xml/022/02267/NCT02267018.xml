	<brief_summary>Preterm baby immature lung frequent pause breathe often necessitate breathe support . Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( nCPAP ) one commonly used tool , always provide enough support . A new option non-invasive high frequency ventilation ( NIHFV ) , gently shake lung help gas exchange may decrease baby 's work breathing . The investigator plan study low birth weight preterm baby generally well require support breathing . By insert special feed tube sensor stomach , investigator measure electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) , important muscle breathing . By analyze EAdi baby receive either nCPAP NIHFV , investigator able measure compare method support affect baby 's breathing . This important study help u determine appropriate breathe support preterm baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diaphragm Electrical Activity Preterm Infants nCPAP Versus NIHFV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure one research accept method deliver NIV term preterm infant . Non-invasive high frequency ventilation relatively new method deliver NIV respiratory support preterm infant . Preliminary study suggest superiority CPAP , NIHFV increasingly utilized clinical practice attempt prevent intubation minimize ventilation-induced lung injury preterm infant . However , little known mechanism action effect respiratory mechanic newborn . The objective study compare effect non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) deliver nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( nCPAP ) versus Non-Invasive High Frequency Ventilation ( NIHFV ) respiratory pattern assess electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant . We hypothesize VLBW preterm infant relative pulmonary insufficiency , NIHFV reduce respiratory drive improve ventilation , subsequently result decrease patient diaphragm energy expenditure . This would demonstrate decreased neural respiratory rate and/or decrease peak electrical activity diaphragm breathe NIHFV compare nCPAP . Clinicians seek alternative method provide non-invasive respiratory support preterm infant . NIHFV relatively new modality increasingly utilized clinical practice well study . This study help u determine non-invasive high frequency ventilation ( NIHFV ) affect breathe preterm infant , compare traditional modality nasal CPAP . Therefore , clinicians able well understand NIHFV work , also utilize information decide appropriate respiratory support modality preterm patient</detailed_description>
