	<detailed_description>Aortic dissection ( AD ) life-threatening cardiovascular disease high mortality . Without optimal treatment , approximately 50 % patient die within one week onset symptom , 80 % die within 2 week . With change life-style development diagnostic technology , incidence detection rate AD increase China recently . However , cause remain unclear . Studies show AD associate risk factor , hypertension , connective tissue disease , iatrogenic injury , drug , pregnancy , etc . It report two third patient AD history hypertension ; 50 % patient age &lt; 40 year accompany hereditary Marfan syndrome ; 13ï½ž19 % familial history aortic aneurysm dissection . These epidemiological data obtain Caucasian population , however , information available Chinese population . Moreover , epidemiological investigation absent China , assessment risk factor AD mainly refer study develop country . Therefore , aim study evaluate epidemiological feature risk factor AD Chinese patient use 3045 individual 15 major center China . We anticipate analysis would provide helpful information prevent control AD China .</detailed_description>
