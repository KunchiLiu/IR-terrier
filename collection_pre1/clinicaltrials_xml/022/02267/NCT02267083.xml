	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study GPX-150 Treat Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm study GPX-150 patient soft tissue sarcoma . Approximately 22 patient treat study . The population study adult patient histologically proven advanced and/or metastatic malignant soft tissue sarcoma intermediate high histologic grade . All patient meet entry criterion receive GPX-150 start dose 265 mg/m2 every 21 day 16 cycle death , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity subject withdrawal . Prior initiation treatment , subject undergo screen baseline evaluation . During study visit , subject evaluate safety . The dose GPX-150 may reduce subject meet specify dose reduction safety criterion . Subjects evaluate regularly safety tolerability . Tumor measurement calculate baseline ( within 28 day prior treatment initiation ) , regular interval receive treatment 1 year . After discontinue treatment phase study , safety assessment tumor measurement perform 3 week last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
