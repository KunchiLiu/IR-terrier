	<brief_summary>This randomize control 6-month trial efficacy novel intervention combine neuroplasticity-based cognitive training aerobic exercise , compare systematic cognitive training alone . The primary treatment target overall cognitive deficit level independent living skill . The investigator hypothesize combine neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training neurotrophin-enhancing physical exercise produce large cognitive functional improvement , even relative cognitive training alone . Adding aerobic exercise cognitive training program additional benefit help ameliorate medication side effect , reduce risk develop metabolic syndrome , help prevent deterioration physical health usually follow onset schizophrenia pharmacologic treatment . The investigator target period shortly first episode schizophrenia maximize generalization cognitive improvement functional outcome , chronic disability establish .</brief_summary>
