	<brief_summary>This project bring together multidisciplinary team pediatric rheumatologist , neurologist , metabolic geneticist exercise physiologist determine effect creatine ( CR ) supplementation muscle function muscle metabolism child Dermatomyositis ( DM ) . The investigator propose use well-established exercise test technique well new , powerful exercise imaging protocol order well delineate effect CR muscle pathophysiology non-invasive way . Evidence study provide information regard effect creatine supplementation muscle function DM . Improvements muscle function fatigue CR use may also contribute improvement quality life significant clinical implication treatment child DM .</brief_summary>
