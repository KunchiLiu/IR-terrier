	<brief_summary>Postoperative delirium ( POD ) frequently occur complication cardiac surgery . Its occurrence associate bad outcome patient , include increase morbidity , prolong hospital stay , increase medical cost , high mortality . It also associate long-term cognitive decline decrease quality life . However , recently , pharmacological intervention effectively prevent occurrence still limit . The purpose study investigate whether perioperative dexmedetomidine use decrease incidence postoperative delirium patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Delirium Patients After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium state global cerebral dysfunction manifest acute disturbance consciousness , attention , cognition perception . It develop short period time ( usually hour day ) tend fluctuate course day . The reported incidence delirium cardiac surgery vary 21 % 47 % . The occurrence postoperative delirium significant harmful effect patient ' outcome , include increase morbidity , prolong hospital stay , increase medical cost , high mortality . Its occurrence also associate long-term cognitive decline decrease quality life . The exact pathogenesis lead occurrence POD still unclear , possibly involve mechanism inflammation , pain sleep deprivation surgery . Furthermore , show anesthesia management might also exert effect . Studies find avoidance unnecessary deep anesthesia ( guidance Bispectral Index monitoring ) decrease incidence POD . Theoretically , measure decrease requirement anesthetic maintain adequate depth anesthesia alleviate inflammation improves postoperative analgesia well sleep quality decrease incidence POD . Dexmedetomidine highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist provide anxiolysis , sedation modest analgesia minimal respiratory depression . Studies show , use adjunctive anesthetic , dexmedetomidine significantly decrease requirement opioid analgesic sedative anesthesia . A recent study group find continuous infusion low-dose dexmedetomidine ( 0.2 ug/kg/h ) first night surgery significantly improve subjective sleep quality . Two randomize control trial find , compare traditional sedative ( midazolam propofol ) analgesic ( morphine ) , use dexmedetomidine patient cardiac surgery associate decrease risk delirium . However , question still exist whether dexmedetomidine prevent delirium increase occurrence since traditional sedatives/analgesics increase risk delirium . Furthermore , animal experiment show dexmedetomidine inhibits degree inflammation induce endotoxin . The investigator hypothesize use dexmedetomidine adjunctive agent perioperative period decrease incidence postoperative delirium patient undergoing cardiac surgery , possibly decrease requirement anesthetic surgery , ameliorate analgesia well sleep quality surgery , alleviate degree perioperative inflammatory response .</detailed_description>
