	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , particularly executive function ( EF ) subtype , common Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) transition dementia , increase fall risk , poor quality life . EF set process include mental flexibility attention need learn optimize performance complex cognitive motor skill . Such skill include ability generalize task performance different condition ( context processing ) perform two task simultaneously term dual-task ( DT ) performance . Deficits EF lead problem daily function loss independence create psychosocial economic burden patient caregiver stakeholder include health care provider . There currently effective treatment PD address EF deficit . Our animal clinical study PD demonstrate skilled exercise facilitates neuroplasticity basal ganglion ( BG ) , brain region sub-serving EF support hypothesis exercise reverse EF deficits PD . Furthermore , recent study healthy age support skill-based exercise specifically promote motor skill fitness ( MSF ) , compare aerobic exercise promote cardiovascular fitness ( CF ) , great impact EF relate BG circuit . The aim application compare elucidate effect skill-based versus aerobic exercise versus control MCI EF subtype PD ; hypothesize skill-based exercise result great improvement EF lead modification underlie neural substrate .</detailed_description>
