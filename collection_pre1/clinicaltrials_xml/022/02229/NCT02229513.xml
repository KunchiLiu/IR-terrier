	<brief_summary>The objective study demonstrate whether cool uterine smooth muscle cesarean section ( follow delivery fetus ) promote good uterine contraction involution result low blood loss , use few uterotonic medication , few hysterectomy follow cesarean section .

	<brief_title>Uterine Cooling During Cesarean Delivery Reduce Blood Loss Incidence Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Patients randomly assign either study group control group . Patients may receive regional ( epidural spinal/epidural ) general anesthesia.Initially , investigator plan enroll 200 subject , 100 study group 100 control group . Following delivery fetus , patient study group also PitocinÂ® administer accord usual protocol.Immediately follow delivery fetus uterus externalize usual fashion body uterus cephalad hysterotomy incision wrap sterile surgical towel saturate sterile , iced normal saline . These towel come sterile cool pot set 30 degree Fahrenheit . The skin abdomen drape prevent contact cold towel . Additional uterotonic medication may give discretion attend obstetrician . Iced saline-soaked towel keep place minimum 5 minute replace discretion attend obstetrician hysterotomy close uterus replace patient 's abdomen . The surface temperature uterus measure use infrared thermometer prior replace uterus abdomen . Two surgical suction canister available . Immediately delivery fetus prior delivery placenta , amniotic fluid blood surgical field aspirate first canister . The second suction canister use aspirate blood fluid conclusion operation . At conclusion surgery blood loss calculate measure content blood second canister minus amount irrigation fluid use , weigh surgical sponge . Average blood loss cesarean section previously report 500 1000 cc . The duration cool uterus record . Use amount uterotonic medication also record . During surgery patient 's vital sign monitor usual fashion . Particular attention pay change temperature . Warmed blanket force air warm blanket use maintain normothermia , require . At conclusion study amount blood loss control study group , amount uterotonic drug calculate compare . The number patient group require additional surgery , e.g . hysterectomy D &amp; C , monitor . Pre-op post-op hemograms compare obtain discretion attend obstetrician . Blood product administration record . Determination ideal temperature cool towel objective study . We 're ask qualitative question , quantitative question time . Study Rationale : The uterus smooth muscle whose contraction modulate directly intrinsic extrinsic oxytocin . During pregnancy spiral artery within uterus beneath placenta enlarge provide adequate perfusion placenta . After separation placenta uterine smooth muscle cell contract pincer-like action pinch spiral artery close . When uterine contraction inadequate ( approximately 4-6 % normal pregnancy ) spiral artery continue bleed . If address bleeding excessive , even lead maternal death . Approximately 5-8 1,000 cesarean section require hysterectomy control bleeding . Release calcium ion sarcoplasmic reticulum store immediate initiator contraction , calcium 's diffusion muscle filament re-uptake sarcoplasmic reticulum result relaxation contraction . In smooth muscle cold enhances contraction ; perhaps slow re-uptake calcium . When usual pharmacologic agent fail induce adequate contraction uterine smooth muscle , investigator suspect application cold may .</detailed_description>
