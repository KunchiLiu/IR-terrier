	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Amicar ( ε-aminocaproic acid ) effective reduce blood loss child undergo craniofacial reconstruction surgery . The investigator hypothesize Amicar decrease intraoperative blood loss decrease need perioperative blood product administration child undergo craniofacial surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Craniosynostosis condition premature fusion one suture bone skull . Premature fusion suture skull limit ability cranial vault expand accommodate rapidly grow brain infancy early childhood lead bony deformation . Left uncorrected , craniosynostosis may adversely impact neurologic psychosocial development case , result high intracranial pressure blindness . Craniofacial ( CF ) reconstructive surgery perform young child craniosynostosis improve physical appearance , prevent functional neurologic disturbance , enhance psychosocial development . Due complexity surgery well young age size patient , CF reconstruction carry potential life threaten risk result significant morbidity . Reported complication include massive intraoperative hemorrhage , intraoperative cardiac arrest , transfusion-related reaction , venous air embolism , hypotension , coagulopathy , bradycardia , postoperative seizure , surgical site infection , facial swell airway compromise , unplanned postoperative mechanical ventilation . The severe common perioperative issue relate rate extent blood loss . Fibrinolysis , impairs adequate hemostasis , show occur child CF reconstruction . This certainly contribute magnitude blood loss type operation . Thus , target defect clot hemostasis use antifibrinolytics reasonable therapeutic approach . Amicar ( ε-aminocaproic acid ) synthetic lysine analog block lysine bind site plasminogen , result antifibrinolytic activity inhibition plasmin formation . We choose study Amicar clinical context number reason . First , major hemorrhage continue significant perioperative issue cohort . Secondly , Amicar commonly safely administer child undergo type high-risk surgery ( i.e. , spinal fusion surgery open heart surgery ) . In addition , Amicar inexpensive easily administer , make viable novel therapeutic option show effective type surgery .</detailed_description>
