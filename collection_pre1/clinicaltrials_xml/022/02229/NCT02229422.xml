	<brief_summary>We hypothesize GA101 - Obinutuzumab combination HDMP well tolerate induce similar high response rate one observe Rituximab plus HDMP study ( Castro et al. , 2009 , Castro et al. , 2008 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) Combination With High-Dose Methylprednisolone ( HDMP ) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Patients ( GA101 &amp; HDMP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase Ib/II clinical trial determine safety clinical activity GA101 - Obinutuzumab combination high-dose methylprednisone ( HDMP ) . We evaluate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) first month therapy part phase Ib study . In phase II determine response rate intention treat analysis . In study include CLL patient never receive treatment well patient fail previous treatment .</detailed_description>
