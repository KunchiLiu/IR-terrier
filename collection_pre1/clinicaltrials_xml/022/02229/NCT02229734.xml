	<brief_summary>This study explore combination stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) approach combine one year luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonist old men high risk prostate cancer , men unwilling undertake conventionally fractionate therapy three year adjuvant hormone therapy . The purpose study examine safety short course radiation treatment combine wtih androgen deprivation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fairly Brief Androgen Suppression Stereotactic Radiotherapy High Risk Prostate Cancer - Protocol 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial establish improved efficacy ( well biochemical control disease free survival ) combine radical radiation ( 70-80 Gy 7-8 week ) combine long term hormone therapy ( 2-3 year adjuvant LHRH agonist ) compare primary hormone therapy radiation therapy alone men locally advanced/high risk disease . While approach may tolerable fit individual , combination may well tolerate frail individual , live distance may find difficult attend 7 week radiation treatment . Those individual co-morbidities diabetes , coronary artery disease osteoporosis may condition exacerbate long term hormone therapy . The combination short course radiation hormone therapy explore FASTR trial . As part trial , patient receive 12 month hormone therapy radiation treatment pelvic lymph node ( dose 25 Gy 5 fraction , 1 fraction per week ) concomitant radiation treatment prostate ( dose 40 Gy 5 fraction , 1 fraction per week ) . The study discontinue due toxicity . For FASTR-2 study , concern address use lower total dose prostate ( 35 Gy 5 fraction , 1 fraction per week ) . Given uncertainty benefit pelvic nodal radiation prostate cancer , decide omit pelvic nodal radiation FASTR-2 study . In addition , give recent evidence support equivalence 18 month hormone therapy , compare 36 month , decide lengthen duration hormone therapy FASTR-2 study 18 month ( versus 12 month FASTR study ) .</detailed_description>
