	<brief_summary>For people identify transgender , strong sense bear wrong body outward look body match truly feel . They feel male , female always felt way . There great deal discomfort dysphoria look feel female , strong desire achieve masculine appearance . While surgery , clothe hair example , help person appear like male , many transgender male want take testosterone make feel look masculine . This usually involve inject testosterone muscle every 1-2 week many year . Intramuscular injection often uncomfortable painful , require patient taught inject . Or somebody else . There grow trend transgender men give injection skin subcutaneously ( like insulin diabetic ) , less uncomfortable n't really know testosterone get blood way . At least one clinic US already suggest patient use subcutaneous method almost research show 's intramuscular . Our project look small group transgender male already intramuscular testosterone switch dose subcutaneous testosterone , compare level testosterone . If level similar , patient may choose less uncomfortable subcutaneous injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : In care transgender male ( born female identify male ) , intramuscular ( IM ) testosterone consider standard care elect therapy transition . Yet , IM testosterone limitation : discomfort ; modest amount teaching ; bleed concern patient anticoagulant ; fluctuation circulate serum testosterone . Erratic absorption may also lead variability mood energy . Due limitation , trend , especially young patient , use comfortable subcutaneous ( SC ) route . However , little data suggest equivalency SC IM testosterone virtually data transgender male . Hypothesis : In transgender male , SC testosterone yield similar pharmacokinetics well tolerability compare IM testosterone . Objectives : 1 . To validate , use cross-over design , whether pharmacokinetic parameter SC vs. IM testosterone administration similar . 2 . To characterize , use validate pain questionnaire patient diary , tolerability SC vs. IM testosterone . Research Plan : Patients ( 19-59 year old ) weekly self-injection schedule either T cypionate enanthate include . Patients medical instability , recent imminent surgery exclude . Twenty-five patient recruit 6 local Vancouver Coastal HealthTrans Primary Care physicians ' clinic . Using cross-over design , trough serum testosterone level IM technique determine weekly 3 week . Patients switch SC injection testosterone ester dosage , weekly trough level measure another 8 week . These trough measurement allow u determine attainment steady-state testosterone level . During 3rd 11th week , serial testosterone level collect generate noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameter , compare two technique . Patients complete validate pain analogue questionnaire initial 3-week IM phase , week 2 8 SC phase maintain diary throughout study . Descriptive inferential statistic use p &lt; 0.05 denote significance . Significance : If SC testosterone yield similar pharmacokinetics well tolerability IM testosterone , reduce perceive barrier IM injection mitigate non-compliance . There potential cost saving patient require clinician inject . The finding may also generalize hypogonadal male . Ultimately , result crucial design large multi-center study provide definitive dosing recommendation .</detailed_description>
