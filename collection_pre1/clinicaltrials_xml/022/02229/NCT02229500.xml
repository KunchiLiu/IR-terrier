	<brief_summary>Obesity , associate co-morbidities , major public health challenge . It estimate 2050 , 60 % men 50 % woman clinically obese . Obesity associate increase risk develop diabetes , cardiovascular disease , certain cancer . The increase epidemic obesity necessitate study complex mechanism underlie energy homeostasis . Food intake , energy balance body weight tightly regulate hypothalamus , brainstem reward circuit , basis cognitive input diverse humoral neuronal signal nutritional status . Several gut hormone , include glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) peptide YY3-36 ( PYY ) , show play important role regulate short-term food intake . Peripheral administration PYY GLP-1 enhances satiety reduces food intake animal man . PYY , GLP-1 along host hormone produce gut response nutrient availability different region gut provide exquisite mechanism nutrient sense response dietary intake . These hormone therefore represent potential target development novel anti-obesity treatment . A novel attractive strategy induce appetite regulation enrichment food component stimulate release GLP-1 PYY . The short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) produce microbial fermentation dietary fibre colon show stimulate release PYY GLP-1 rodent enteroendocrine L cell , via stimulation G-protein couple free fatty acid receptor ( FFAR ) colonic L cell . Of SCFAs produce colonic fermentation dietary fibre , propionate high affinity FFAR 2 . Furthermore , propionate end product bacterial metabolism , thus , unlike acetate , undergo conversion SCFAs . Increasing colonic propionate therefore attractive target appetite modulation . We develop novel delivery system deliver propionate right site colon wish optimise delivery propionate colon man use stable isotope label method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The role SCFA appetite regulation : SCFA show stimulate PYY GLP-1 production animal model dietary fibre , SCFA major end product , induce appetite regulation human . However evidence underpinning dietary fibre induce appetite regulation human weak difficulty control study high fibre intake . In recent project fund BBSRC DRINC initiative ( BB/H004815/1 ) , first direct evidence SCFA directly regulate appetite human . Prior study , order achieve production SCFA level , high enough induce appetite-regulating effect , large amount dietary fibre ( &gt; 25 g/d 40 g/d ) require , compliance high fibre diet poor due gastrointestinal side effect . Furthermore , supplement diet mixed high fibre predictably reliably increase colonic SCFA production circulating level SCFA human population variability gut microbial activity . Finally , orally administer SCFAs palatable rapidly absorb small intestine L cell sparse . In study date focus SCFA propionate high affinity receptor end product metabolism microbiota therefore seem obvious target manipulate investigate effect SCFA appetite regulation . To overcome unpalatably high level fermentable dietary fibre need significantly increase colonic propionate level , unpredictability production result SCFAs , develop test novel delivery system target release gram quantity propionate proximal colon . We estimate delivery system may lead 2-8 fold increase colonic propionate , level difficult achieve feed mixed fermentable fibre diet . This level propionate production might observe ancestral diet part rural Africa dietary fibre intake high . We also demonstrate delivery system increase plasma propionate level , reduces food intake acute study appetite , long term study ( 24 week ) , positive effect food intake , body composition , glucose homeostasis , circulate lipid , cholesterol liver function , liver visceral fat weight management observe . However , study pragmatically choose preparation could produce scale . The amount propionate release varied may affect rate amount propionate release . For ingredient , potential incorporate wide variety foodstuff , wish investigate optimum delivery system preparation delivers maximal propionate dose least amount material . We plan use non-invasive , stable isotope label methodology determine propionate bioavailability range delivery system preparation , order determine optimum preparation deliver maximal propionate proximal colon .</detailed_description>
