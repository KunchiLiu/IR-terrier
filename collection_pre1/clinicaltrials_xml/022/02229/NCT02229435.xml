	<brief_summary>Statement : Patients Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 60 ml/min use MDRD-6 ( Modification Diet Renal Disease ) formula and/or CKD-EPI ( Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ) formula undergo nephrological urological care ( diagnosis treatment ) prevent chronic kidney failure . This recommend National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) , Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) European Urological Association ( EAU ) .
