	<brief_summary>The purpose study elucidate molecular mechanism underlie prostate cancer disparity . In previous work investigator identify set differentially deregulate gene African American versus Caucasian American prostate cancer . Based finding , hypothesize able validate target , originally identify previous work conduct The George Washington University Medical Center , independent Duke University Medical Center cohort prostate cancer specimen . In addition , investigator hypothesize able discover novel target Duke University Medical Center cohort prostate cancer specimens regional difference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individual patient African American Caucasian American prostate biopsy core surgical specimen obtain follow procedure : transrectal ultrasound biopsy prostate ( TRUSBxP ) , MR fusion biopsy , intra-operatively ( IO ) time prostatectomy . Using cellular DNA RNA , isolated prostate cancer patient-matched normal prostate biopsy core surgical specimen , investigator perform ancestral genotyping , exon array , target RNA sequencing , epigenetic analysis . As control , blood also collect . Genomic data blood tumor tissue compare .</detailed_description>
