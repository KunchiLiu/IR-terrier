	<brief_summary>Accelerated , normofractionated radiotherapy treatment choice stage II-III laryngeal oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . However , twenty thirty percent patient stage II-III laryngeal HPV negative oropharyngeal SCC develop disease progression , mainly due lack locoregional control . Radiosensitizers cisplatin cetuximab add radiotherapy advanced stage head neck ( H &amp; N ) cancer . These radiosensitizers improve loco-regional control overall survival . Unfortunately , radiosensitizers , notably cisplatin , also dose intensify radiation dose normal tissue , also significantly increase toxicity . Adding tumor-specific radiosensitizing agent could improve loco-regional control overall survival without significantly increase toxicity . Radiotherapy kill tumor cell induce DNA damage . The efficacy radiotherapy limited ability tumor cell repair DNA damage . Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) essential enzyme base excision repair single strand break DNA repair , DNA lesion arise radiation treatment . PARP inhibition consequently inhibition PARP-facilitated DNA repair enhance anti-tumor activity radiotherapy , show preclinical study include head neck xenograft study . This radiosensitization think proliferation dependent pronounce homologous recombination ( HR ) deficient cell , provide opportunity tumor specific target . Genetic analysis suggest HR deficiency commonly find H &amp; N SCC : ATM loss report 60 % human H &amp; N SCC biopsies FANC-F defect report 15-21 % human H &amp; N SCC biopsy cell line . The efficacy radiotherapy also limit tumor hypoxia , tumor hypoxia result radioresistance . Some PARP inhibiting compound increase tumor perfusion xenograft model , thereby reduce hypoxia specifically sensitize tumor cell radiotherapy . Hypoxia commonly find H &amp; N SCC high pre-treatment hypoxic fraction H &amp; N SCC tumor associate bad outcome . The high prevalence hypoxia HR deficiencies H &amp; N SCC support concept tumor-specific radiosensitization PARP inhibition head neck cancer patient . Olaparib potent PARP inhibitor develop anti-cancer drug HR defect tumor dose intensifier chemo- radiotherapy . In human , olaparib low toxicity profile single agent , increase bone marrow toxicity combine chemotherapy . The combination olaparib radiotherapy H &amp; N SCC expect improve locoregional control thereby overall survival . However , combination treatment never test human . The purpose study determine safety tolerability radiotherapy stage II-III laryngeal stage II-III HPV-negative oropharyngeal SCC concurrent olaparib .</brief_summary>
