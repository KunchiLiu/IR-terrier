	<brief_summary>Burn pain know one severe form acute pain often require large amount narcotic addition adjuvant . Topical lidocaine effective control pain various setting include dress change burn . The aim study demonstrate effectiveness topical lidocaine decrease pain score narcotic requirement apply donor graft site time interfere standard care TheraBond dressing . During study investiagtors monitor evidence delay wound healing , surgical site infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pain burn severe form acute pain require aggressive use opioids . Even implementation multiple modality analgesia , pain skin debridement graft procedure remain challenge control . Local anesthetic use pain relief burn patient previously topical gel IV infusion find significantly reduce medication consumption , without apparent adverse effect wound heal . Lidocaine actually potent anti-inflammatory effect could advantageous wound . In addition , topical application lidocaine wound result different degree systemic absorption . High concentration lidocaine potential central nervous system ( seizure ( &gt; 5mg/L ) ) cardiovascular toxicity ( arrhythmias ( &gt; 9mg/L ) ) . Plasma concentration lidocaine depend upon drug dose , rate absorption , patient weight , physical status thickness skin harvest . A prior study 6.7mg/kg 2 % lidocaine epinephrine spray donor graft sit find systemic lidocaine level far toxic level peak ( average level 1.4 , maximum level 2.2 ) . In study level peak 30 60 minute systemic level lidocaine detectable 6 hour follow application solution . Studies demonstrate beneficial effect systemic lidocaine administer via IV infusion reduce perioperative pain scores.Topical lidocaine effective topical anesthetic multiple clinical trial however two study date show topical lidocaine apply skin-harvest site produce analgesic effect , reduce narcotic requirement affect wound heal cause toxic blood concentration . In study systemic intravenous lidocaine level monitor found significantly toxic limit . The use topical lidocaine donor site still widely use , partly fear lidocaine interfere wound heal and/or dress adherence . No study date demonstrate lidocaine solution effective burn site use conjunction TheraBond silver foam dress . TheraBond absorbent , atraumatic dressing coat ionic silver routinely use donor site University Florida . This study also offer additional supporting evidence topical lidocaine effective post operative pain management donor skin sit widely utilized . In addition , study serve step stone analyze different local anesthetic solution future potential reapplication surgical site . The purpose study offer medical community data simple relatively cheap adjuvant utilize help reduce amount post-operative pain narcotic requirement burn patient require skin graft .</detailed_description>
