	<brief_summary>This prospective comparison trial . Patients include trial operation abdominal closure temporary , i.e . patient sustain trauma septic abdomen . Patients group accord method temporarily abdominal closure ( TAC ) procedure : 1 . Vacuum-assisted closure ( VAC ) 2 . `` Bogota bag '' ( BB ) , sterile intravenous bag silo closure . The two method currently accept clear cut evidence prefer one another . At Soroka Medical Center decision choose either method surgeon 's discretion . Intra-abdominal pressure measure patient urinary bladder pressure technique 6 12 24 ant 48 hour post operation . The measurement routine procedure do part monitoring process critically ill patient General Intensive Care Unit ( GICU ) . Patients evaluate development acute intra abdominal hypertension without abdominal compartment syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comparison intra-Abdominal hypertension development bogota bag VAC abdominal closure Protocol Trial objective : To investigate compare standardized manner development intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) follow VAC closure `` Bogota bag '' . Study design : This prospective comparison trial . Patients include trial operation abdominal closure temporary , i.e . patient sustain trauma septic abdomen . Patients group accord method temporarily abdominal closure ( TAC ) procedure : 1 . VAC closure 2 . `` Bogota bag '' ( BB ) , sterile intravenous bag silo closure . The two method currently accept clear cut evidence prefer one another . At Soroka Medical Center decision choose either method surgeon 's discretion . Intra-abdominal pressure measure patient urinary bladder pressure technique 6 12 24 ant 48 hour post operation . The measurement routine procedure do part monitoring process critically ill patient GICU . It carry nurse blind type abdominal closure . Patients evaluate development acute significant respiratory compromise , include elevated inspiratory pressure &gt; 35 mbar decrease partial oxygen pressure / fraction inspire oxygen ( PaO2/FIO2 ) &lt; 150 torr , hypotension ( &lt; 90 mmHg systolic pressure due hemorrhagic , septic , neurogenic cause ) , renal dysfunction ( urine output , &lt; 30 mL/hr ) , clinically determine rigid , tense abdomen , increase abdominal circumference . The following data record . Hemodynamics ( mean arterial pressure , heart rate ) , lactate , PaO2 , partial carbonic dioxide pressure ( PaCO2 ) , tidal volume , peak airway pressure ) renal ( urine output ) function register 24 48 hour follow surgery ) . Data indication operation , type trauma , severity operative procedure . Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) fluid balance 24 48 hour . Reoperations . Time ICU time final abdominal closure . Study population : All patient severe abdominal trauma none traumatic acute abdomen , end operation surgeon decide use temporary abdominal closure ( TAC ) . Inclusion Criteria Adults male female 18 year old . The surgeon decides need TAC end operation . Exclusion Criteria Patients surgeon estimate survive 24 hour . End point : Development IAH Development abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) Need reoperation decompressive laparotomy first 48 hour . Time final ( discharge hospital ) abdominal closure type closure . Statistical methodology The calculated sample size base power 0.80 , alpha 0.05 , know incidence 0.25 estimate incidence 0.10 42 patient .</detailed_description>
