	<brief_summary>Purpose study : - To evaluate effect tranexamic acid ( TXA ) intraoperative blood loss patient subject bi-maxillary orthognathic surgery - To evaluate potential effect TXA fibrin structure - To evaluate potential effect TXA binding plasminogen fibrin - To evaluate potential effect TXA postoperative edema formation . Hypothesis : H0 : Intraoperative bleeding significantly reduce preoperative administration tranexamic acid H0,1 : Postoperative edema significantly reduce preoperative administration tranexamic acid</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population consist patient refer simultaneous mandibular maxillary osteotomy Department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery , Hospital South West Denmark 2014 . Hundred patient ( 50 men 50 woman ) enrol study . Reportedly , mean intraoperative blood loss placebo group expect 436 ml standard deviation 208 ml . The difference blood loss TXA-group placebo group detect 100 ml . The dropout frequency estimate 10 % . To fulfil assumption minimum 40 patient include group reach power 0.8 alpha 0.05 . In order accommodate even gender distribution block randomization perform result randomization 100 patient . The patient randomize receive blindly either 10 ml tranexamic acid ( 100 mg/ml ) ( Pfizer , Ballerup , Denmark ) 10 ml saline ( 9mg/ml ) preoperatively . Intraoperative blood loss determine deduct total volume irrigation fluid volume content surgical suction device . Postoperative edema formation determine 3D surface scan volumetric analysis carry `` Landmarker '' software .</detailed_description>
