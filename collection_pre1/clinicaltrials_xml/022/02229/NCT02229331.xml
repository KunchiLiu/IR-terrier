	<brief_summary>Haemophilia rare X chromosome-linked coagulation disorder result congenital deficiency absence circulate factor VIII ( Haemophilia A ) factor IX ( Haemophilia B ) .As consequence , patient haemophilia unable generate adequate thrombin result abnormal bleeding . Approximately 80-90 % bleed episode occur musculoskeletal system , especially large synovial joint muscle . Repeated haemarthrosis induce joint cartilage damage irreversible degenerative joint disease . Regular intravenous administration coagulation factor concentrate start first joint bleed and/or age 2 ( 'primary ' prophylaxis ) evidence-based , first-choice treatment child severe haemophilia . This primary prophylaxis radically decrease incidence arthropathy patient haemophilia . Despite positive effect primary prophylaxis arthropathy several joint , ankle joint seem exception rule , patient haemophilia treated primary prophylaxis still experience ankle arthropathy . As , ankle main affected joint patient haemophilia age 20 . This make scientific community face new challenge . Determining aetiologic/contributing factor associate ankle arthropathy pathophysiological cascade child haemophilia ( CwH ) therefore primary objective haemophilic research community nowadays . Loading ankle crucial ankle plantar flexor provide main propulsive power gait , tibiotalar joint caries complex distribution joint stress consequence talar morphology kinematics , biomechanical biochemical viewpoint , differs significantly major low limb joint . Previous biomechanical study focus kinematic strength measure , however , omit incorporate fundamental measure joint loading ( joint kinetics ) joint structural integrity ( JSI , assessment soft tissue osteochondral integrity MRI ) . This make impossible draw firm conclusion biomechanical contribute factor . Furthermore , , low-quality study focus conservative treatment strategy ( e.g . strength training , mobilisation , proprioceptive training ) patient ankle arthropathy . In minority case , important adverse effect ( joint bleeding strength proprioception training ) report . Because low quality intervention study lack biomechanical study focus joint load joint integrity , impossible pinpoint aetiology side effect . One assumption might side effect originate inappropriate conservative approach consequence lack knowledge joint load joint integrity . An innovative approach within domain ankle arthropathy CwH therefore study foot lower limb kinetics gait . The quantification foot joint kinetics encompass considerable challenge , recently , simplify single-segment foot model use . Those model typically underestimate mechanical contribution different foot joint , equal importance , overestimate kinetic contribution tibiotalar joint . To overcome mentioned shortcoming , valid 3D Multisegment Foot Kinetic Model ( 3DMFKM ) develop introduce within population CwH . This important allow quantify increase load tibiotalar joint ( joint ) may help explain ankle arthropathy patient . This miss previous research due consideration foot one entire segment . Providing classification system base kinetic data would , second stage , pertinent valuable approach provide rationale design randomize controlled trial . In perspective , also recommend ass relationship biomechanical anatomical determinant , especially one aim develop optimal management rehabilitation strategy .</brief_summary>
