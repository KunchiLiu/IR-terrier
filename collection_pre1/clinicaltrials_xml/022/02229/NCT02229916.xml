	<brief_summary>The majority testicular cancer patient cure cisplatin-based chemotherapy . Mortality reduce even within last 15 year due stringent application standard chemotherapy follow resection residual disease . This positive development consider testicular cancer usually affect young men . Active surveillance become acceptable widely use strategy stage I testicular cancer . Thus , important follow patient standardized way adhere rationale surveillance strategy . There international consensus regard follow-up testicular cancer patient . Stratification accord risk pattern relapse would allow tailor follow-up schedule , aim early identification relapse without cause unnecessary harm use excessive radiation young long-term survivor . Follow-up procedure aim detect relapse , also long-term side effect therapy , include hypogonadism , metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease secondary malignancy . The Swiss Austrian German Testicular Cancer Cohort Study ( SAG TCCS ) comprise consecutive newly diagnose testicular cancer patient first study prospectively evaluate initial indictor relapse testicular cancer patient , frequency pattern relapse document long-term toxicity treatment ( cardiovascular , gonadal , hear impairment , renal function second malignancy ) psychosocial aspect . This cohort study determine relevance test perform routinely follow-up . The collect data direct implication care patient testicular cancer inform future adaptation follow-up recommendation . The dataset give information baseline factor testicular cancer patient patient , current treatment strategy Switzerland , Austria Germany , outcome late sequela .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swiss Austrian German Testicular Cancer Cohort Study - SAG TCCS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary objective The primary objective determine diagnostic performance clinical impact variety test , include conventional radiograph , computer tomography ( CT ) , abdominal ultrasound , serum tumour marker ( AFP , beta-HCG LDH ) clinical sign symptom aim early detection relapse curative therapy document complete remission . Secondary objective Diagnostic performance : 1 . To determine rate relapse detect chest x-ray seminoma patient . 2 . To determine rate false positive abnormality CT scan false positive tumour marker elevation due seminomatous non-seminomatous germ cell tumour relapse due process . 3 . To determine modality rule testicular cancer relapse patient false positive index test . Pattern care : 4 . To assess patient characteristic baseline time-point relapse detection . 5 . To determine rate stage I seminoma non-seminoma patient undergo active surveillance . 6 . To obtain overview treatment follow-up strategy germ cell cancer patient Switzerland . Outcome : 7 . To collect data treatment sequela follow testicular cancer treatment term organ function , cardiovascular risk factor , sexual health socioeconomic aspect . 8 . To determine rate intermediate poor-prognosis disease relapse . 9 . To determine rate offspring spontaneously conceive testicular cancer treatment . Design Prospective cohort study Centres All urologist , radiooncologists oncologist motivate enrol patient . We aim enrol majority patient treat followed private practice . Patients Consecutive patient testicular cancer type stage ( incident case ) . Testicular cancer generally classify seminomatous ( seminoma ) nonseminomatous germ cell tumour ( non-seminoma ) testis . Mixed germ cell tumours belong group non-seminomas . The stage disease choice treatment ( active surveillance vs. chemotherapy vs. radiotherapy ) define risk relapse , pattern relapse long-term toxicity . Staging testicular cancer perform accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) primary tumor , regional node , metastasis ( TNM ) stag system testis cancer . Metastatic testicular cancer classify accord International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group ( IGCCCG ) risk group . Clinical outcome Relapse testicular cancer define rise concentration serum alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) upper limit normal ( typically &gt; 13 Î¼g/l ) and/or human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) upper limit normal ( typically &gt; 5 U/l ) and/or lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) upper limit normal confirmation rise second test four week later and/or radiographic evidence metastatic disease typical location , and/or presence active germ cell tumour establish biopsy , whatever come first . Index test The following test perform ( ordered accord burden patient cost ) : symptom assessment , physical examination , tumour marker measurement , chest x-ray , abdominal ultrasound CT scan abdomen pelvis . Procedures Follow-up perform accord mandatory follow-up schedule physician substantial experience treatment surveillance patient germ cell tumour . Follow-up comprises thorough assessment medical history patient ' symptom focus pain , appetite , fatigue , sexual function activity daily live ; physical examination include lung auscultation , abdominal , axillary , supra- infradiaphragmatic regional lymph node testicular palpation ; serum tumour marker measurement : AFP , HCG LDH ; chest x-ray abdominal ultrasound CT scan . Even though role LDH follow-up debatable , due limited sensitivity specificity high rate false-positive test , contribute identify relapse significant number case , show recent publication . All laboratory radiological test perform independently result make available investigator prior symptom assessment physical examination . In addition ascertain cardiovascular risk factor ( smoke status , lipid profile , bodymass index , fast glucose etc . ) , renal function , testosterone level , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level , lutenizing hormone ( LH ) level , socioeconomic characteristic ( education , employment , partnership ) annual interval . Statistics Sample size consideration There approximately 400 newly diagnose testicular cancer patient Switzerland per year . In Germany annual testicular cancer incidence 4000 . We aim include approximately 300 patient per year Switzerland duration 3 year , total number 900 patient . We also aim registration 2000 patient per year Germany . Looking Swiss cohort , estimate 15 % rate relapse follow-up duration two year , yield approximately 135 case relapse . This number yield satisfactory statistical precision . An assumed sensitivity 50 % specificity 95 % Beta-HCG , example , detect relapse yield positive likelihood ratio ( LR ) 10 negative likelihood ratio 0.53 . Corresponding 95 % confidence interval 42 58 % sensitivity , 93 97 % specificity , 7.0 14.2 positive likelihood ratio 0.44 0.62 negative likelihood ratio . An assumed sensitivity 37 % specificity 99 % CT scan , example , detect relapse yield positive likelihood ratio 37 negative likelihood ratio 0.64 . Corresponding 95 % confidence interval 29 45 % sensitivity , 98 100 % specificity , 17.7 77.4 positive likelihood ratio 0.56 0.72 negative likelihood ratio . Measures diagnostic accuracy determine relation occurrence timepoint diagnosis relapse specify . Tests positive within previous 8 week establish diagnosis relapse consider true positive , test remain negative time period false negative . Conversely , test positive time period consider false positive , test negative period true negative . We use multi-level model random effect level patient time-points estimate sensitivity specificity likelihood ratio , data organise long format , test outcome ( positive negative ) time-point represent one line dataset , determine time-point whether within 8-week time-period previous time-point establish diagnosis relapse . The model take account correlation multiple time-points test within patient . The positive LR indicate much likely find positive test patient relapse ( sensitivity ) compare without relapse ( 1-specificity ) . Conversely , negative LR specifies much less likely find negative test patient relapse ( 1-sensitivity ) compare patient without ( specificity ) . A test consider provide clinically relevant power rule relapse positive negative LRs 5 0.2 , respectively . The test consider strong power rule relapse LRs 10 0.1 , respectively . As measure clinical impact addition extensive test , examine net re-classification improvement integrate discrimination improvement . The net re-classification improvement addition extensive test define improvement probability appropriate classification patient accord relapse status ( presence absence relapse ) , afford addition extensive test . This correspond sum difference proportion individual classify positive minus proportion classify negative individual develop event , proportion individual classify negative minus proportion classify positive individual develop event . The integrated discrimination improvement define improvement average sensitivity afford addition extensive test minus potential loss specificity afford addition extensive test . All analyse do use Stata , Release 11 ( Stata Corp LP , College Station , TX ) .</detailed_description>
