	<brief_summary>Immunoglobulin G4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) increasingly recognize syndrome unknown etiology comprise collection disorder share specific pathologic , serologic , clinical feature . Histopathological analysis biopsy specimens remain cornerstone diagnosis IgG4- related disease . Elevated concentration IgG4 tissue serum helpful diagnose IgG4-related disease , neither one specific diagnostic marker . Correlation specific histopathological finding essential , regardless serum IgG4 concentration , number IgG4-positive plasma cell tissue , ratio IgG4 IgG tissue . Misdiagnoses IgG4-related disease increasingly common excessive emphasis moderate elevation serum IgG4 concentration overreliance find IgG4-positive plasma cell tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IgG4 unique antibody structure function . This molecule account less 5 % total IgG healthy person least abundant IgG subclass . In contrast IgG1 , IgG2 , IgG3 , serum IgG4 concentration among ostensibly healthy people vary factor 100 ( normal range , 0.01 1.4 mg per milliliter ) , IgG4 concentration within individual person generally stable . Immunoglobulin G4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) increasingly recognize syndrome unknown etiology comprise collection disorder share specific pathologic , serologic , clinical feature . These different condition previously think unrelated [ 2-4 ] . The commonly share feature include tumor-like swell involved organ , lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enrich IgG4-positive plasma cell , variable degree fibrosis characteristic `` storiform '' pattern . In addition , elevate serum concentration IgG4 find 60 70 percent patient IgG4-RD . Two major presentation condition , often affect one organ , type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis ( IgG4-related pancreatitis ) salivary gland disease ; later may present salivary gland enlargement sclerosing sialadenitis ( formerly term `` Mikulicz disease '' Küttner 's tumor , respectively ) . These condition often resemble Sjögren 's syndrome pathophysiologically distinct disorder . The preferred name overall condition IgG4-related disease . The presence IgG4-bearing plasma cell require diagnosis IgG4- related disease , IgG4-positive cell find wide variety inflammatory infiltrates , detection substantial number IgG4- positive plasma cell therefore diagnostic IgG4-related disease . Tissues patient IgG4-related disease show diffuse infiltrate IgG4-bearing plasma cell , contrast focal aggregate IgG4-bearing cell detect inflammatory mimicker condition . A diffuse plasma-cell infiltrate 30 IgG4-positive cell per high power field ratio IgG4 IgG high 50 % provide compelling evidence IgG4-related disease . The study examine clinical data computerize database Meir Hospital patient unknown IGG4-related disease high serum level IGG4 admit hospitalization reason period 14 year , January 2000 June 2014 . Since biopsy prove hallmark diagnose IGG4 RD , decide complete investigation pool patient high IGG4 serum level confirm biopsy suitable tissue obtain reason IGG4 RD perform specific stain IGG4 sample , send back pathology service hospital . Furthermore clinical laboratory feature positive patient correlate history admission patient .</detailed_description>
