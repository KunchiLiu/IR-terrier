	<brief_summary>This randomized Phase 2 study evaluate two different steroid-based mouth rinse ( Miracle Mouth Wash plus hydrocortisone versus prednisolone oral rinse ) prevention treatment everolimus-associated stomatitis ( mouth sore ) postmenopausal patient undergoing treatment aromatase inhibitor plus everolimus . An exploratory analysis also evaluate patient response next anti-cancer therapy physician 's choice follow discontinuation therapy aromatase inhibitor plus everolimus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Miracle Mouthwash Plus Hydrocortisone v Prednisolone Mouth Rinse Mouth Sores Caused Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stomatitis , inflammation mucous membrane line mouth throat , common side affect associate chemotherapy radiation therapy . In addition , stomatitis report approximately 44 % - 64 % patient treat everolimus ( Afinitor PI ) . However , mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) inhibitor-induced stomatitis ( mIAS ) different clinical entity , manifest frequently discrete aphthous-like lesion rather diffuse inflammation . Oral lesion typically well demarcate , single multiple ovoid-shaped ulceration , grayish-white pseudomembrane . In BOLERO-2 trial , 56 % patient MBC ( metastatic breast cancer ) treat exemestane plus everolimus developed stomatitis , 37 % develop grade 2/3 stomatitis . These rate consistent rate report everolimus therapy patient type cancer ( Afinitor PI ) . Although adverse event reversible , approximately one-fourth patient treat everolimus BOLERO-2 trial require dose interruption dose reduction , may impact benefit therapy . Despite frequency stomatitis associate mTOR inhibitor therapy , strategy prevent and/or ameliorate painful side effect well define document . Expert guideline management mIAS develop , guideline base retrospective observational and/or anecdotal evidence , prospective data efficacy mIAS prevention management strategy need . There evidence suggest steroid therapy may helpful management mIAS . Steroid-containing ointment mouth rise also show alleviate symptom patient non-chemotherapy associate apthous oral ulcer . Reports effectiveness non-steroid mouthwash formulation mixed , agent induce topical anesthetic effect , may help reduce discomfort pain . Thus , present study design investigate effectiveness two oral rinse ( miracle mouth wash [ MMW ] plus hydrocortisone , v prednisolone ) prevent reduce severity stomatitis patient MBC undergo treatment aromatase inhibitor plus everolimus ( AIE ) . In addition , little known impact everolimus therapy response later line treatment MBC , preclinical data suggest mTOR inhibition may resensitize cell endocrine therapy , study also assess tumor response next anti-cancer therapy physician 's choice , include duration response sit progression . All patient receive everolimus 10 mg PO QD ( mouth , every day ) plus standard dose AI ( physician choice Letrozole , Exemestane , Anastrozole ) . Patients randomize 1:1 12 week treatment either : - Arm 1 : MMW plus hydrocortisone - Arm 2 : Prednisolone oral solution ( 15mg/5ml ) Treatment oral rinse start Day 1 everolimus therapy , self-administered . Patients instructed swish expectorate ( cough spit ) 10ml assign mouth rinse 4 time per day . Patients may also gargle 4 time per day assign rinse symptom pharyngitis . Patients also instruct fill Oral Stomatitis Daily Questionnaire ( OSDQ ) home every day . The incidence stomatitis , well adverse event , dose reductions/interruptions , everolimus discontinuation due toxicity , monitor first 12 week treatment . After end initial 12 week randomize portion study , patient continue follow every 2 month ( 1 year follow discontinuation everolimus progression intolerable toxicity progression subsequent anti-cancer therapy , whichever occur first ) determine AIE treatment discontinue reason discontinuation ( toxicity , progression ) , sit disease progression , response next anti-cancer therapy physician 's choice ( physician assessment ) duration response , sit disease progression next anti-cancer therapy follow progression AIE .</detailed_description>
