	<brief_title>Selinexor Combination With Irinotecan Adenocarcinoma Stomach Distal Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single group , non-randomized , phase I study cohort expansion utilize standard 3+3 design dose . The dose selinexor escalate combination standard dose irinotecan . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) study define high dose level 1 less 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity DLT . Once MTD reach and/or recommend dose expansion determine , additional cohort 15 patient advanced gastric esophageal cancer accrue well define safety tolerability combination regimen .</detailed_description>
