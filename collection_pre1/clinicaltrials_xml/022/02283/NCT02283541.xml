	<detailed_description>Falls lead cause injury -- ‐related death senior population ( i.e . 65 year age old ) 1. ; approximately 30 % community -- ‐dwelling senior suffer fall least per year , proportion increase age 2. . In Canada , 40 % fall senior result hip fracture oftentimes lead partial recovery 3. , therefore uncommon old adult report fear fall ( FOF ) . FOF particularly common community -- ‐dwelling old female previously experience fall [ 4,5 ] . In individual , FOF actually lead activity avoidance [ 5 ] . Moreover , senior suffer fall report reduction quality life [ 6 ] . A systematic review Scheffer et al . [ 4 ] identify major outcome FOF reduction physical mental health , quality life increase risk fall . Older adult suffer symptom depression also likely severe FOF , lead activity restriction group [ 7 , 8 ] . As , minimize risk fall older population important implication physical mental wellbeing individual cohort . Among risk factor increase likelihood senior suffer fall gait impairment [ 9 ] depression [ 10 -- ‐12 ] . Indeed , measure gait use predict future fall [ 13 ] increase depressive symptom associate increase fall rate [ 10 ] . An association establish depression gait deficit , even confound variable socio -- ‐demographic overall health status control ; specifically , depression associate reduction various gait parameter include gait velocity , stride length swing time variability [ 14 , 15 ] . At present , antidepressant first line treatment depression , however senior response rate antidepressant trial adequate dose duration often inadequate low 30 -- ‐ 40 % [ 16 ] . In addition , antidepressant use often associate number adverse event include increase fall risk [ 11 ] impairment gait [ 17 , 18 ] . For example , healthy senior , single dose amitriptyline lead gait impairment subject require walk presence obstruction [ 17 ] . Therefore relationship depression , gait , fall risk complicate standard pharmacological treatment practice population . In recent year , various non -- ‐pharmacological intervention embrace patient late life depression ( LLD ) . Loosely defined mind -- ‐body therapy , include biofeedback , energy healing , meditation , guide imagery , yoga [ 19 , 20 ] . Amongst practice , meditation therapy may particular benefit old adult gait impairment LLD ; meditation non -- ‐invasive , easy learn , negligible side effect , practice anywhere show multi -- ‐organ benefit [ see 21 review ] . Whilst relatively study examine effect meditation gait , study mindfulness -- ‐based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) find therapy normalized gait pattern adult history depression [ 22 ] . Additionally , particular type meditation , refer automatic self -- ‐transcending meditation ( ASTM ) show reduce symptom depression [ 23 ] . Currently , research team commence data collection phase REB approve study receive funding Academic Medical Organization Southwestern Ontario ( AMOSO ) Innovation Fund . This study single blind longitudinal naturalistic randomize control trial target individual late -- ‐life depression , examine effect ASTM autonomic mood -- ‐related symptoms depression . In framework ASTM study opportunity closely examine relationship gait depression elderly population , well potential benefit mind -- ‐body therapy gait FOF . We kindly request funding Department Psychiatry carry investigation . Specifically , aim ass gait parameter stride length gait velocity , show affected depression [ 14 , 15 ] , LLD patient receive ASTM train addition current treatment schedule ( ASTM group ) well continue treatment usual ( TAU group ) . A thorough literature clinical trial registry search reveal one previously , currently , examine effect ASTM train parameter gait LLD patient .</detailed_description>
