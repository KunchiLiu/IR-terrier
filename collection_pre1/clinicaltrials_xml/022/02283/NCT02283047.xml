	<brief_summary>Obesity arterial hypertension ( HTN ) frequently coexist patient . Moreover , concept obesity HTN additive term cardiovascular rist widely accept . Yet , clinical decision-making obese patient complicate surprising lack evidence relative importance obesity HTN treatment efficacy safety . Lifestyle intervention mainstay obesity management program also advocate prevention treatment HTN . Physical exercise diet recommend prevent control obesity HTN . Aerobic exercise firmly establish effective measure lower blood pressure reduce cardiovascular risk . However , agreement optimal dose frequency , intensity , duration type exercise . Therefore , aim study : 1 ) ass change select parameter blood pressure , cardiorespiratory fitness , body composition biological marker bring period 16-week different aerobic exercise program hypocaloric diet overweight obesity primary hypertensive adult , 2 ) examine effect six month detrain subsequent intervention . Secondary objective examine additional effect intervention physical activity behavior health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
