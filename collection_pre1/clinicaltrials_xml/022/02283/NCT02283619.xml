	<brief_summary>Purpose study : The goal study evaluate relationship electrocardiogram ( ECG ) find clinical outcome cohort patient leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) evaluate acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) Emergency Department ( ED ) . Background significance : The significance specific ECG finding patient LBBB evaluate ACS inadequately study , gap knowledge barrier optimal management population . Due speed , availability , low cost , non-invasive nature ECG , would ideal identify ECG characteristic help risk stratify patient order inform clinical decision-making , reduce unnecessary invasive testing , conserve resource . Methods : In prospective observational study investigator identify consecutive series adult patient LBBB present ED suspicion ACS . The investigator collect data include demographic , cardiac risk factor , initial ECG measurement , lab radiographic result , procedure result , clinical outcome 30-day death myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The investigator analyze data use cohort study design calculate odds ratios ECG characteristic outcomes interest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Bundle Branch Block ECG Characteristics Evaluation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose study : The goal study identify initial electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding ( include ST/S ratio T-wave morphology ) predict clinical outcome ( myocardial infarction , positive stress test , revascularization death ) , cohort Emergency Department ( ED ) patient leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) evaluate acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Design &amp; procedure : The investigator prospectively identify adult ( 18yrs old ) patient present institution 's ED evaluate ACS LBBB ECG . The investigator collect data demographic ( include age , date birth ) , cardiac risk factor , date time presentation ED , ECG measurement , lab radiographic result ( cardiac biomarker data include date time sample , stress test result , coronary imaging result , coronary catheterization result ) clinical outcome 30-day death MI . They collect copy ECGs measure follow : ST/S ratio ( ratio amplitude ST segment deviation S wave amplitude ) ; T-wave morphology ( entirely discordant , entirely concordant , biphasic PR interval ) ; standard ST segment deviation . A logistic regression analysis use identify ECG feature associate 30-day death , MI , revascularization . In sub-cohort subject negative `` modify Sgarbossa criterion '' subanalysis identify outcome rate follow specific sub-populations : less 2 consecutive partially-concordant T-wave lead 2 consecutive partially-concordant T-wave lead . Selection Subjects : The population patient age 18 old present ED LBBB suspect ACS . The investigator expect mean age study population approximately 60 year old , patient 40 90 . They anticipate patient average multiple medical comorbidities give LBBB ACS report sicker , old population cardiac risk factor usual ACS patient without LBBB . Patients age 18 exclude extremely rarely ACS and/or LBBB . The investigator anticipate 300 subject . Inclusion criterion : age 18 old , LBBB ECG , present ED evaluate ACS . Exclusion criterion : prisoner , institutionalized individual , patient incapable give legally effective consent , patient understand spoken English . Consent process : After initial screening process , potential subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion object learn study initial discussion primary provider , one key personnel train authorized consent approach potential subject discus study explain follow : purpose study future benefit may provide subsequent patient , prospective observational nature study , study procedure , risk loss confidentiality , safeguard risk . All information clearly print plain language consent form . The potential subject give choice enroll study . Only potential subject allow provide consent . The potential subject discharge transfer Emergency Department decide whether participate study . The minimal risk minimal subject involvement justify practical logical time requirement . The consent process occur potential subject 's room Emergency Department . Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations : The data analyze cohort study design , calculate odds ratio ECG characteristic outcomes . The two primary ECG characteristic investigate 1 ) presence least 2 consecutive lead least partially concordant T-wave ( biphasic entirely concordant ) , 2 ) ST/S ratio ( ratio ST-segment deviation S R wave amplitude , whichever great ) . Secondary ECG feature measure include heart rate , rhythm , interval , bundle branch block , PR ST segment deviation concordance/discordance , P/Q/R/S/T amplitudes , QRS duration , QT interval , T wave inversion , segment contour concavity/convexity . The primary outcome interest 1 ) positive cardiac troponin T biomarker level index visit , 2 ) positive stress test result index visit . Secondary outcome include rate 30-day myocardial infarction , 30-day death , 30-day revascularization . The investigator present summary statistic subject demographic , ECG finding , lab/imaging/procedure result , outcome . They determine association dichotomous outcome cardiac biomarker ( cTNT ) level , stress test , MI , death , revascularization , normally distribute continuous clinical demographic characteristic use t-tests normally distribute continuous data Wilcoxon test non-normally distribute data , categorical characteristic use Fisher 's exact Chi-squared test . Associations continuous variable assess use Spearman Pearson correlation . Significance test assess alpha = 0.05 . Analysis conduct use SAS 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) .</detailed_description>
