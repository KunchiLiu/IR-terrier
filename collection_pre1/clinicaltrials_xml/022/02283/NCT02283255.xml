	<brief_summary>Introduction : Different variation Fontan operation use treat complex cardiac anomaly single functional ventricle . This procedure substantially improve quality life survival patient complex cardiac anomaly . However , cardiovascular pulmonary function well skeletal muscle alteration explain exercise intolerance patient still poorly understood . Objectives : 1 ) To evaluate effect different exercise program adolescent adult Fontan circulation . Methods : A long-term randomized clinical study include 60 patient 12 30 year , submit total cavopulmonary connection least 5 year post operative Heart Institute , University São Paulo Medical School . The patient divide four group : 1 ) Exercise training aerobic exercise + low upper limb strength exercise ( GTF-I ) ; 2 ) Respiratory train respiratory muscle exercise ( GTF-II ) ; 3 ) Exercise training aerobic exercise + low upper limb strength exercise + Respiratory train respiratory muscle exercise ( GTF-III ) ; A non-exercise group control group ( GNTF-IV ) . The patient revaluated 4-month period intervention . Expected Outcomes : The investigator expect demonstrate exercise training respiratory training substantially improve cardiovascular pulmonary response skeletal muscle system patient univentricular circulation . In addition , investigator wil test hypothesis effect exercise training associate respiratory training cardiovascular pulmonary response skeletal muscle system may great exercise training respiratory train alone .</brief_summary>
