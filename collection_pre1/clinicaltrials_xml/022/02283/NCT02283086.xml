	<detailed_description>Setting Subjects This IRB-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective randomize control trial conduct January 1 , 2012 December 31 , 2013 ED urban Level-I adult trauma center . Imaging CDS deploy CTPE request throughout study period previously report . Ordering provider could ignore evidence present CDS proceed CTPE request deviate evidence-based guideline without interference . The investigator include attend emergency physician , prior randomization , stratify quartile 2012 CTPE use . Physicians randomize quartile two group use random number generator : intervention group receive individualized feedback report CTPE adherence EBG , use ( defined number CTPEs per 1,000 patient ) , yield ( percentage CTPEs positive PE ) , control group . Data Collection Use CTPEs physician calculate use number complete CTPE examination total number patient see quarter . Yield CTPEs acute PE determine use previously validate natural language processing tool report percentage total CTPEs complete . Adherence EBG determine apply Wells Criteria review serum D-dimer level ( obtain ) . The discrete criterion make Wells Criteria prospectively document investigator computerize order entry ( CPOE ) system time order entry , previously report . In order determine whether difference observe guideline adherence result `` gaming '' ( erroneous data entry either avoid potentially onerous CDS interaction enhance physician 's apparent performance feedback report ) investigator perform manual chart review 100 randomly choose chart two group . These chart review perform attend physician ass concordance adherence EBG calculate CDS data , adherence EBG calculate data document ED visit clinical note . The sample size determine use baseline concordance 90 % previously report , chosen detect difference concordance 15 % group power 80 % alpha error rate 5 % . Demographic data ( include gender age year since residency training measure begin study period ) also capture attend physician study .</detailed_description>
