	<brief_title>Clinical Test MRgHIFU System Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 25 % - 50 % woman childbearing age uterine fibroid . Also , 25 % woman fibroid suffer metrorrhagia , menorrhagia , dysmenorrheal pelvic compression n't good quality life . The bad case fertility patient fibroid hinder . The current clinical treatment medication surgery . Medication suppress symptom temporarily hysterectomy method remove part uterus cure patient completely . However , hysterectomy invasive operation woman fibroids plan baby n't accept kind treatment . Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focus ultrasound ( MRgHIFU ) system noninvasive treatment uterine fibroid develop approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 2004 . The ultrasound wave emit ultrasonic probe propagate skin , fat , muscle , soft tissue converge fibroids focus . High energy/intensity focus cause thermal necrosis fibroid tissue several second . The whole process HIFU ablation fibroid monitor guided MR thermometery . The advantage MR-HIFU modality include incision , outpatient treatment side effect . The objectives program verify safety effectiveness MRgHIFU system develop division Medical Engineering National Health Research Institutes ( NHRI ) , achieve clinical trial Chang-Gung Memorial Hospitals Linkou commercialize self-developed MRgHIFU system . The mission conduct first-stage clinical test 10 woman symptomatic uterine fibroid make two set HIFU system . Meanwhile , impact quality life satisfaction treatment patient diagnose symptomatic uterine fibroid analyze .</detailed_description>
