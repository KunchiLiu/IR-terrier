	<brief_summary>Recent work show low load , high-repetitive single limb resistance training , compare control , increase limb muscle function functional exercise capacity patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) avoid occurrence limit exertional symptom . However , comparison another exercise regimen perform . In addition neither intramuscular mechanism exercise regimen investigate represent aim propose project . We prospective , assessor-blind ; block randomize control , parallel-group trial compare single-limb two-limb low load , high-repetitive resistance training patient severe severe COPD The research hypothesize : - single-limb low-load high-repetitive resistance training provide large gain 6-min walk distance two-limb low-load high- repetitive resistance training patient severe severe ( stage III-IV ) COPD . - eight week single limb training also associate large physiological ( increased muscle endurance , less muscle fatigue deoxygenation ) structural ( muscle protein synthesis , fiber-type distribution capillarization ) muscle adaptation training , low cardio- respiratory demand , well great increase health-related quality life comparison two-limbs simultaneous training . We also compare group baseline investigate acute effect mechanisms single-limb two-limb low load , high-repetitive resistance training , comparison also include healthy matched control . The research hypothesize : - involve large muscle mass exercise ( e.g. , two-limb low load , high-repetition resistance training ) compare involve small muscle mass training ( e.g. , single limb low load , high-repetition resistance training ) would lead large restraint cardiorespiratory system patient severe severe COPD . Conversely , single limb intervention produce less dyspnea muscle deoxygenation fatigue two-limb simultaneous exercise healthy control able perform legs/arms exercise without central constraint , negative consequence muscle fatigue exercise stimulus .</brief_summary>
