	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Assess Safety , Tolerability Immunogenicity Ebola Virus Vaccine ( rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct assess safety immunogenicity experimental ebola vaccine . An outbreak due Ebola Zaire ( ZEBOV ) strain unprecedented magnitude scope high mortality continue spread across West Africa . No vaccine currently license . The specific opportunity hand rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP ( BPSC1001 ) achieve long-lasting protective immunity ZEBOV time scale week humans upon single-shot vaccination , offer discrete benefit prime-boost vaccination protocol . The current outbreak represent global health emergency need access therapeutic intervention vaccine paramount . The vaccine investigate study might provide critical tool suppress future out-breaks EVD area risk . This study 1 4 clinical trial currently conduct part WHO-led VEBCON consortium , aim generate harmonize data rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP ( BPSC1001 ) vaccine candidate allow optimize rapid decision dose safety .</detailed_description>
