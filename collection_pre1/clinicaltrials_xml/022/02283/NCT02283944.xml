	<brief_summary>The propose project aim develop novel electrochemotherapeutic treatment glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Standard treatment limited effect survival quality life . Electrochemotherapy novel promising treatment , demonstrate convincing result treatment various type carcinoma . The treatment base combination electrical current stimulation tumor cell simultaneous administration chemotherapeutic drug . Electrochemotherapy work induce electrical current implant electrode tumor tissue , cause electroporation cancer cell membrane , thereby increase cellular permeability drug uptake . Electrochemotherapy proven efficient way considerably increase potency chemotherapeutic drug bleomycin malignant cell skin tumor carcinoma metastasis , thereby increase cytotoxicity drug locally tumor tissue . This allow treatment low dos chemotherapeutic drug define , local area effect , thus decrease systemic effect . The investigator propose use novel non-invasive safe technique call focus transcranial magnetic stimulation ( focused TMS ) induce electrical current tumor tissue . TMS safe widely implement technology use treat multiple neurological disease pain , depression stroke . Studies show effective electroporation cell membrane obtain use induction electromagnetic field cell suspension , new focus TMS enables focus treatment select brain region without surgical intervention , thereby focus chemotherapeutic treatment pathological tissue avoid surgery relate brain tissue damage . Additionally , TMS transiently increase blood-brain barrier permeability , theoretically allow increase uptake chemotherapeutic drug target area . This address significant challenge treatment brain cancer , cytotoxic drug fairly limited ability pas blood brain barrier . The intention research project investigate therapeutic potential focus TMS alternative non-invasive source current induction thereby mean treat several type brain cancer electrochemotherapy .</brief_summary>
