	<brief_summary>The goal study validate Dual Energy CT ( DECT ) urography perform 50 % reduction iodinate contrast dose result CT exam equal good image quality equal well diagnostic capability compare traditional Single Energy CT ( SECT ) perform standard contrast dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Energy CT Urography With Reduced Iodinated Contrast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize DECT urography perform 50 % iodine dose reduction equivalent SECT urography perform full iodine dose : - Enhancement aorta , renal artery , renal vein - Enhancement renal cortex - Enhancement renal pelvis , ureter , bladder - Subjective evaluation image quality - Objective evaluation image quality In addition , investigator hypothesize DECT virtual non-contrast image use material suppression low iodine CT exam result equivalent diagnostic information compare SECT true non-contrast image obtain patient exam . If true non-contrast image could replace virtual non-contrast image without loss information , potential DECT significantly low radiation dose well significantly decrease iodine dose . The investigator design research protocol prospectively test hypothesis population scan 50 % reduced iodine DECT urography protocol compare control population scan standard iodine dose clinical SECT urography protocol .</detailed_description>
