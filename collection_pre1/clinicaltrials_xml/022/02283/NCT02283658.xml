	<brief_title>Everolimus Letrozole Treating Patients With Recurrent Hormone Receptor Positive Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Demonstrate combination letrozole everolimus lead high percentage patient free progression 12 week ( PFS 12 ) compare observe previously report phase 2 trial letrozole alone relapse ovarian carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Cancer antigen ( CA ) -125 response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , confirm response rate , adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify molecular biomarkers associate response treatment letrozole everolimus patient relapse ovarian carcinoma . II . Develop determine response rate letrozole everolimus patient derive xenograft ( PDX ) avatars correlate response note patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) letrozole PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
