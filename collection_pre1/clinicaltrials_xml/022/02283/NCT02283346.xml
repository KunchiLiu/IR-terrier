	<brief_summary>The hypofractionated external radiation ( EBRT ) technique radiation dose delivery use high daily fraction use routinely . In way cause damage tumor , especially tissue slow proliferation rate , case prostate cancer . Furthermore , achieve reduction total treatment time probably lesser chance development collateral tissue high multiplication rate line rectum bladder effect . With brachytherapy boost high dose rate achieve administer intense dose tumor lower sound around region treat tissue , improve therapeutic window . Treatment retract fully ambulatory time , potential benefit early patient return usual activity optimize flow patient require treatment radiotherapy . This prospective study aim assess result toxicity profile treatment regimen retract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Fraction HDR Brachytherapy Plus Hypofractionated EBRT Low-risk Prostate Cancer : Phase II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE The primary objective analyze toxicity profile , via phase II study treatment patient low risk prostate cancer association hypo fractionate EBRT HDR brachytherapy boost . It also analyze biochemical control expense procedure . STUDY DESIGN Prospective phase II study randomize . Patients localize low-risk prostate cancer recruit participate protocol hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy follow brachytherapy high dose rate . INCLUSION CRITERIA - Biopsy confirm adenocarcinoma prostate ; - Low risk prostate cancer : le equal T2a , less equal 10 ng PSA / ml stage Gleason score less equal 6 - Prostate volume less equal 60cc . EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Patients 18 90 year ; - Adjuvant Hormone ( duration ) ; - Prior pelvic radiotherapy ; - Adjuvant Chemotherapy . OUTCOMES Primary outcome : Reduction rectal acute morbidity ( within three month treatment ) late ( three month twelve month last treatment recruit patient ) . Reduction acute urinary morbidity ( within three month treatment ) late ( three month twelve month last treatment recruit patient ) . The primary outcome ( toxicity ) evaluate patient receive 90 % intend dose protocol crte HDR brachytherapy . ( Scale use : CTCAE v4.03 , Published online : May 28,2009 United States Department Health Human Services - NIH - attach ) . Secondary outcome : Biochemical control ( serial PSA measurement interval three month first year , four month second year , six month third year onwards ) . Cost-analysis procedure STAGING Performing follow test : 1 . Physical examination - rectal ( TR ) 2. transrectal US ( TRUS ) 3. pelvic CT 4. serum prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) dosage 5 . Bone Scan ETHICAL ASPECTS The treatment regimen monitor possible emergence excessive toxicity , consider appearance 25 % case cause termination protocol . The study begin approval Research Ethics Committee ( CEP ) AC Camargo Cancer Center . Each patient sign term inform consent ( IC ) prior study entry . The term write accessible layman 's language patient , follow ethical recommendation . Patients may withdraw study time , without prejudice propose treatment . We declare confidentiality personally identifiable patient , possible identify analysis publication data .</detailed_description>
