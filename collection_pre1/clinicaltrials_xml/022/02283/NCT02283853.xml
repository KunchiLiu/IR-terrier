	<criteria>Key Must body weight ≥30 kg . Must diagnosis RRMS ( consensus definition pediatric RRMS [ Krupp 2007 ] ) . Must ambulatory baseline EDSS score 0 5.5 , inclusive . Must experience least 1 relapse within last 12 month prior Day 1 least 2 relapse within last 24 month prior Day 1 , prior brain MRI demonstrating lesion consistent MS , evidence Gdenhancing lesion brain MRI perform within 6 week prior Day 1 . Must neurologically stable , evidence relapse within 50 day prior Day 1 evidence corticosteroid treatment within 30 day prior Day 1 . Subjects childbearing potential sexually active must willing practice effective contraception study willing able continue contraception least 30 day final dose study treatment . Key Primary progressive , secondary progressive , progressive relapsing MS ( define [ Lublin Reingold 1996 ] ) . These condition require presence continuous clinical disease worsen period least 3 month . Subjects condition may also superimpose relapse distinguish relapsingremitting subject lack clinically stable period clinical improvement . Disorders mimic MS , demyelinate disorder ( e.g. , acute disseminate encephalomyelitis ) , systemic autoimmune disorder ( e.g. , Sjögren disease , lupus erythematosus ) , metabolic disorder ( e.g. , dystrophy ) , infectious disorder . History premalignant malignant disease . Subjects basal cell carcinoma completely excise prior screening remain eligible . History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction , know drug hypersensitivity DMF fumaric acid ester . History abnormal laboratory result indicative significant endocrinologic , hematologic , hepatic , immunologic , metabolic , urologic , renal , and/or major disease would preclude participation clinical study . History clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , GI , dermatologic , growth , developmental , psychiatric ( include depression ) , neurologic ( MS ) , and/or major disease would preclude participation clinical study . .History human immunodeficiency virus . An MS relapse occur within 50 day prior Day 1 AND/OR subject stabilize previous relapse prior Day 1 . Other unspecified reason , opinion Investigator Biogen Idec , make subject unsuitable enrollment . For PD/PK subset subject : subject unable swallow BG00012 capsule whole . Key Treatment history Any previous treatment Fumaderm ( fumaric acid ester ) BG00012 . Prior treatment follow : total lymphoid irradiation , cladribine , Tcell Tcell receptor vaccination , therapeutic monoclonal antibody , exception rituximab natalizumab . Prior treatment follow medication within 12 month prior Day 1 : mitoxantrone , cyclophosphamide , rituximab . Prior treatment follow medication procedure within 6 month prior Day 1 : fingolimod ; teriflunomide ; natalizumab ; cyclosporine ; azathioprine ; methotrexate ; mycophenolate mofetil ; laquinimod ; intravenous ( IV ) immunoglobulin ; plasmapheresis cytapheresis Prior treatment follow within 3 month prior Day 1 : glatiramer acetate ; interferonalpha ; interferonβ ( subject positive neutralizing antibody interferonβ may receive interferonβ treatment 2 week prior Day 1 ) Treatment follow medication within 30 day prior Day 1 : steroid ( IV oral corticosteroid treatment , include agent may act corticosteroid pathway [ e.g.low dose naltrexone ] ) , 4aminopyridine relate product ( except subject stable dose controlledrelease fampridine 3 month ) NOTE : Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
