	<brief_summary>Clinical evidence effect cannabis perioperative setting management acute pain rather scarce , mostly consist case report-based opinion adverse event general anesthesia smoking cannabis , experimental pain trial healthy volunteer , clinical trial use different drug , dosage route administration . It difficult draw strong conclusion available evidence , may seem sometimes even contradictory , mainly due -the investigator believe- many source variability study design ( e.g . : heterogeneity study sample , underpowered , unblinding , lack randomization , time therapeutic intervention , different experimental pain model , inclusion different kind surgical pain , etc. ) . Nevertheless , expert 's opinion critical review literature cannabis cannabinoids may beneficial role management acute post-operative pain nausea , least select group patient appropriate therapeutic intervention . Therefore , seem u pertinent carry investigation order re-evaluate issue perioperative cannabis use sufficiently power controlled clinical trial . Some cannabis effect sedation , bronchodilation , dryness respiratory secretion , vein dilation , increase heart rater without produce hypertension , make attractive option pre-medication ; antiemetic property analgesic potential without cause respiratory depression may profitable post-operative period . Nabiximols seem suitable investigation . The co-administration tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cannabidiol ( CBD ) may translate additional therapeutic benefit attenuation adverse effect . The investigator expect obtain less sedation , milder `` high '' , low incidence anxiety , tachycardia , hyperalgesia , compare THC-only acute pain trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthetic Premedication With Cannabis Extract ( Cannapremed )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selection patient do pre-anesthetic assessment day surgery . After obtain informed consent , eligible patient randomly allocate one follow regime : nabiximols high dose ( 21.6 mg THC + 20 mg CBD ) , nabiximols low dose ( 10.8 mg THC + 10 mg CBD ) , active placebo ( prefilled syringe 1 mg midazolam + 1 g acetaminophen I.V . ) , placebo control ( premedication drug ) . Treatments administer double-dummy manner . Identical bottle Sativex® placebo obtain manufacturer ( GW Pharmaceuticals ) . Identical prefilled vial contain either active placebo ( 1 mg midazolam + 1 g acetaminophen ) sodium chloride 0.9 % prepared hospital pharmacist . To best knowledge , clinical study evaluate effect nabiximols acute pain perioperative setting do date . Therefore , investigator estimate Sativex® dose range seem reasonable obtain relevant clinical manageable occurrence adverse event , mainly base recommendation manufacturer , available pharmacological data present previous section result clinical trial similar design use comparable dos oral THC . Nevertheless , first 10 patient randomly assign either nabiximols low dose group placebo control group . The investigator proceed full four-group randomization serious adverse event register among 10 first recruited patient . At arrival operating room , blood sample baseline level cannabinoids draw moment place intravenous line , first anxiety assessment do examiner/anesthetist . The study drug administer entrance O.R . induction room 15 minute induction anesthesia ( i.e. : ) . Premedication dose calculate equivalent 10 mg 20 mg oral THC low high dose group , respectively ( 4 , 8 puff ) . At time , prefilled syringe contain either 1 mg midazolam + 1 g acetaminophen sodium chloride 0.9 % administer intravenous bolus . The patient immediately connect standard O.R . monitoring . Induction general anaesthesia do standardized fashion fentanyl 2 µg/Kg , propofol 1-4 mg/Kg ( vecuronium 0.1 mg/Kg intubation require ) . For anaesthetic maintenance , isoflurane 0.7-2 % 1:2 oxygen : nitrous oxide gas mixture , fentanyl bolus 1 µg/Kg keep bispectral index ( BIS ) 40 60 , heart rate mean arterial pressure 70-130 % pre-induction baseline . Preemptive antiemetic ( e.g . : granisetron , ondansetron , metoclopramide , dexamethasone , etc . ) give . No additional analgesic administer ( e.g . : ketorolac NSAID 's , dipyrone ) . A load dose morphine 0.2 mg/Kg give end surgery provide patient maintain spontaneous breathing pressure support ventilation . Intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) initiate arrival recovery room boluses 1 mg lockout time 6 minute , without background .</detailed_description>
