	<brief_title>Study Early Diagnosis Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , PDx assay design validated order distinguish Idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient similar symptom healthy control . The differential diagnosis cohort include patient diagnose Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) , Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP ) , Corticobasal Degeneration ( CBD ) , Essential Tremor ( ET ) Lewy Body Dementia ( LBD ) Healthy Controls . This prospective observational study . Blood sample clinical data collect first study visit . The expression level 5 6 gene analyze blind technician concern diagnosis , demographic data clinical data , reveal send PDx gene expression value clinical site . The gene expression level compare Parkinson 's disease patient differential diagnosis cohort healthy control . The primary aim study design validate clinical classifier aid physician diagnosis Parkinson 's disease patient . The analysis perform two stage : Stage 1 ) Exploration analysis Stage 2 ) Validation . After one year take blood sample , study physician contact confirm patient 's diagnosis . Blood sample collect specialized movement disorder clinic . Medical history , clinical diagnostic feature , family history regard Parkinson 's disease , use medication routine image assessment ( mandatory ) collect first patient visit .</detailed_description>
