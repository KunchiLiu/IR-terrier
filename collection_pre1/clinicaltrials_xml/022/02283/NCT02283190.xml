	<brief_title>1336GCC : Study Erwinaze Treatment Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For safety : Erwinaze already use clinical practice treatment patient acute leukemia know side effect profile . For reason , protocol , use `` 3+3+3 '' design evaluation safety base pre-determined dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . In `` 3+3+3 '' design , dose escalation rule proceed adjust dose cohort 3 9 patient per three dose levels:20,000 IU/m2 ( dose cohort -1 ) , 25,000 IU/m2 ( dose cohort 0 ) , 30,000 IU/m2 ( dose cohort +1 ) . The goal determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) For anti-leukemic activity : To evaluate activity Erwinaze reduce serum glutamine desire level , dose adjust accord pre-defined algorithm base 48-hour trough serum glutamine level ( biochemical response ) prior dose 6 patient . If safety profile acceptable , enroll total 15 patient dose level well study analyze glutamine-reducing effect Erwinaze define dose . In summary , 9 patient treat certain dose least 7 9 individual respond treatment ( per serum glutamine level ) &lt; 3 develop DLT , dose level declare Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) . Six additional patient ( total 15 18 patient ) enrol RP2D level well assess toxicity document response . There intra-patient dose escalation reduction .</detailed_description>
