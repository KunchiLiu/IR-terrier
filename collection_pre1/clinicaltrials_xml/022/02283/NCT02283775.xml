	<detailed_description>The study duration individual patient include screen period inclusion 21 day , treatment period may continue disease progression , unacceptable adverse reaction reason discontinuation . After study treatment discontinuation end treatment ( EOT ) visit do approximately 30 day last study treatment component administration ass safety perform ADA PK sample . Then follow-up visit 60 day last SAR650984 administration do ADA sample . If ADA positive inconclusive Day 60 , ADA repeat every 30 day ADA negative . Patients discontinue treatment reason progression disease follow every month progression initiation subsequent therapy , maximum one year , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
