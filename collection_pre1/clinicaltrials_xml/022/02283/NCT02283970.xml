	<detailed_description>The aim study select homogeneous small group surgical patient subtype BAV aortic behaviour identify markers/predictors favorable-unfavorable aortic wall evolution evaluate BAV phenotype likely consider high risk aortic degeneration . The study focus multiple aspect BAV disease . What follow consider combined : Aortic valve , aorta root ascend aorta morphology The use two- ( 2DE ) three-dimensional ( 3DE ) trans-thoracic ( TTE ) and/or transoesophageal ( TOE ) echocardiography identify kind BAV morphology ( leaflet position coronary ostia displacement ) . It also give quali- quantitative information root ascend aorta morphology size . BAV genetics Recently , missense mutation NOTCH1 gene show associate calcific aortic valve disease plus BAV . However mutation NOTCH1 gene partially explain presence BAV absence syndromic disease ( i.e . Marfan Syndrome , Loeys Dietz Syndrome type I II Ehlers Danlos type IV Syndrome ) . BAV Histology In enrolled patient , operation , tissue sample collect valve cusp ( case valve involvement ) , aortic wall ( aortic root , concavity convexity ascend aorta ) . Samples analyze order classify medial intimal disruption change . Study Design Setting Study The first step consist enrol patient echocardiographic diagnosis BAV indication surgery . From echo data , aortic valve , well aortic root ascend aorta morphology assess order classify patient phenotypic pattern . The echo image participate centre send echo core lab quali- quantitative analysis ( see ) data record specific database . The second step consider first-degree relative enrol patient . The investigator ask every first degree relative perform screen TTE order find , accord familiar aetiology BAV , presence BAV and/or associate disease ( aortic root ascend aorta enlargement coronary ostia displacement ) . The third step consist collect blood sample patient first-degree relative BAV diagnosis . BAV-specific genetic test perform data recorder specific database . The fourth intraoperative step consist : 1. perform 3D TOE order study geometry dynamic behaviour aortic valve root 2. collect surgical tissue sample : operation describe precisely anatomy valve aorta detail ; , usual site surgery , collect valve aortic wall sample order perform histological , immunohistochemical genetics test . Blood surgical sample store bio-bank future analysis relate protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman 18 yearsold age 60 ( age selection prevent enrol patient agerelated valve aortic wall degeneration ) . For BAV stenosis group consider patient 60 yearsold : include frequent form BAV disease common age , group could use control group compare outlier one . Echo diagnosis BAV indication surgery : BAV isolate regurgitation , BAV normal valvular function associate aorta dilatation , BAV valve regurgitation aortic dilatation BAV isolate stenosis Signed inform consent Patient previous cardiac great vessel surgery coexistent coarctation aorta nonassociated cardiac disease : valve disease ( aortic ) , ischemic disease , congenital heart disease . Marfan syndrome connective tissue disorder involve aortic valve aortic wall disease ( history disease clinical sign ) . Other conditions/circumstances likely lead poor study adherence ( e.g . psychological organizational reason ) . Serious disease aortic , severely limit life expectancy . Patients refuse give informed consent</criteria>
