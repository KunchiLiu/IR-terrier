	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System Personal ( System-P ) Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System Professional ( System-Pro ) use adjunct blood glucose test 14-day wear period adult subject . The Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System - Professional Sensors wear adult subject 14-day wear period . The primary objective characterize Systems performance respect YSI reference venous sample measurement . The device performance primarily evaluate term point rate accuracy Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems reference YSI . Safety Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems characterize Adverse Device Effects Serious Adverse Device Effects experience study participant . 240 subject enrol additional healthy subject may also enrol study training subject .</brief_summary>
