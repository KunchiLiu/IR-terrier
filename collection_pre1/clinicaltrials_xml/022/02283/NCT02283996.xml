	<detailed_description>A . Objectives The purpose study identify individual 18 old diagnostic presentation adhesive capsulitis randomize two arm , distinguish use physical therapy steroid injection compare steroid injection follow watchful waiting . This prospective study use determine whether significant impact patient outcome whether additional financial burden justified . The standard care call initial non-operative therapy consist NSAIDs , watchful waiting , oral parenteral corticosteroid administration consideration operative therapy 6 month fail conservative therapy . We would like enroll patient willing randomized postpone operative therapy period one year would schedule follow visit regular interval . There experimental intervention study . The use physical therapy , oral parenteral corticosteroid , watchful wait offer follow standard care adhesive capsulitis . B . Background Adhesive capsulitis , also know `` frozen shoulder '' common orthopedic condition affect 2-5 % general population13 . As defined American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons , self-limiting condition result inflammatory process shoulder capsular scar tissue produce , result pain limit range motion . The majority shoulder function come interaction glenohumeral ligament complex , rotator cuff complex , articulate bone . The superior glenohumeral ligament important stabilization glenohumeral joint adduction external rotation . The middle glenohumeral ligament important stabilizing structure position adduction external rotation abduction 45° external rotation . The resistance , therefore tension , inferior glenohumeral ligament , negligible position neutral adduction adduction external rotation , increase value angle 45° 90° , indicate important stabilize function ligament position . The rotator cuff comprise tendon supraspinatus , infraspinatus , teres minor , subscapularis muscles1,10 . In disease state , capsular pattern shoulder dysfunction characterize slight limitation medial rotation , moderate limitation passive abduction , importantly , severe limitation lateral rotation . The finding lateral rotation limitation capsular pattern limitation diagnostic assessment AC . The rotator cuff comprise subscapularis , biceps , supraspinatus , infraspinatus , teres minor muscle . The subscapularis muscle may divide nine belly . The muscle act main internal rotator shoulder joint provide support traumatic posterior dislocation . The supraspinatus main abductor arm 30° degree deltoid muscle take . It constitute posterior margin rotator cuff interval . A fusion infraspinatus teres minor tendon common latter sometimes consider inferior belly infraspinatus . Hence , presence separate teres minor tendon consider variation . The infraspinatus act opposition subscapularis main external rotator arm work conjunction teres minor complete objective . Teres minor also assist extension arm1,10 . Several shoulder score system use measure patient outcomes surgery therapy . These include The American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment ( ASES ) , Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand Questionnaire ( DASH ) , Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score System . In addition , physical exam finding , patient satisfaction , return athletics use delineate outcome . Our study use ASES , DASH , Constant Score System17 . Stages - 1 . - Freezing ( inflammatory ) : consist initial onset pain loss range motion last anywhere six week nine months7 2 . - Frozen : may show improvement pain , worsen range motion generally last four six months7 3 . - Thawing : consist resolution symptom partial full return function take six month two years7 The commonly affected demographic adult fourth sixth decade life median onset 55 year old high incidence woman men . The condition generally present unilaterally non-dominant shoulder commonly affect progression bilateral presentation within 5 year 6 17 % patients.16,18,22¬ The aim treatment bimodal one aspect resolution pain improve range motion . Common treatment include NSAIDs , oral corticosteroid , intra-articular corticosteroid injection without anesthetic , well intracapsular distention without corticosteroid . Corticosteroid injection - A randomized pilot study 2009 show clinically significant improvement aspects function quality life patient undergo corticosteroid injection , statistically significant difference patient underwent capsular distension21 . The use injection short term proven efficacious short term alleviate pain increase ROM . The utility steroid long term call question 2008 prospective study show comparison steroid injection physical therapy physical therapy alone yield change end result2 . Short wave diathermy manipulation anesthesia ( MUA ) - Uses radio frequency energy generate heat tissue , analgesic effect reduces muscle spasm joint stiffness . In one study , short-wave diathermy show randomize control trial improve outcome compare general home exercise16,22 . Physical therapy - Maitland mobilization physiotherapy observe single case design provide increase quality life , significant objective change functional status15 . Another prospective outcome study evaluate patient underwent non-operative treatment show simple home exercise program positive outcome even patient previously fail attempt resolution intensive physiotherapy15,20 . Watchful wait - A wait see approach , show improve outcome intense physiotherapy case favorable achieve near pain free function within 24 month . Systematic review 2012 review nineteen database UK cost efficacy various intervention make significant claim intervention economically advantageous propose multi-arm trial compare high quality conservative management , steroid injection , steroid injection conjunction capsular distension , capsular release MUA16 . With grow cost healthcare need cut extraneous intervention , role physiotherapy adjunctive measure thoroughly evaluate . While sufficient study cost effectiveness aforementioned review suggest , one study address use physiotherapy follow capsular distension21 . The conclusion garner study show use physiotherapy cost effective show beneficial advantage improve pain , function , quality life5,15,19 . By determine objective contribution physiotherapy resolution adhesive capsulitis compare operative management , several protocol relate inconsistency elaborate upon . The purpose study compare contrast benefit yield use adjunctive physiotherapy patient undergo conservative management adhesive capsulitis . This provide basis evaluate whether economically effective use resource . If impact find negligible long term resolution adhesive capsulitis , study 's result use advocate alternative therapy could avoid cost innumerable asset .</detailed_description>
