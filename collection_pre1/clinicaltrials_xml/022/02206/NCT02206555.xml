The project inform policy development regard primary HIV prevention PrEP . This open-label , single-arm treatment evaluation study . All consent eligible HIV negative participant receive TRUVADA prescribe daily administration orally . At followup visit , follow procedure conduct : clinical evaluations/ procedure , laboratory evaluations/ procedure , test HIV , STIs , hepatic renal function , assessment adherence prescribe medication , side effect , eligibility next TRUVADA prescription , willingness continue PrEP . As study requirement , participant offer self-administered assessment behaviour , lifestyle attitude conduct ideally within two seven day clinic visit participant 's private space . Analyses include : feasibility PrEP delivery , adherence study medication , safety tolerability , effect PrEP use behavior , statistical analysis risk HIV seroconversion .</brief_summary>
