	<detailed_description>Scoliosis disease involve lateral and/or rotational deformity spine affect 4 % population . Typically , surgery consider Cobb 's angle , measurement use evaluation curve scoliosis anterior-posterior radiographic projection spine , great 50 degree thoracic region ( 40 degree lumbar region ) curvature cause significant pain , respiratory cardiovascular restriction . Patient undergo surgical correction experience severe pain postoperative period management include use opioid-based patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) . Methadone opioid one long elimination half-life use effective analgesic acute , chronic , neuropathic , cancer pain adult , child , even neonates1-5 . Its long duration action antagonism N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor may decrease need PCA use postoperative period . Gourlay2 demonstrate effectiveness utility perioperative methadone include advantage longer analgesia serious side effect respiratory depression . A recent study Gottschalk2 adult patient demonstrate 50 % reduction postoperative opioids 48 hour low pain score single bolus methadone surgical incision . However , major weakness study patient receive equipotent intraoperative opioids . In addition , adolescent patient population undergo much large surgical incision potential great postoperative pain . Despite potential benefit , methadone seldom use perioperative setting . A recent pharmacokinetic study methadone adolescent undergo spine surgery fail show reduction opioid consumption power determine pharmacokinetics secondary endpoint postoperative opioid consumption . An appropriately power study still require determine efficacy methadone reduce postoperative pain spine surgery .</detailed_description>
