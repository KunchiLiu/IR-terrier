	<detailed_description>The subject pool comprise 100 elderly ( 65 year old ) , male female subject reside assist living center . All subject provide write informed consent participation . For day prior test test day subject encourage follow standard hydration guideline old adult consume 1200-2400 ml/day depend upon body weight subject . The application HM follow specific protocol base prototype HM user manual specific anatomic location . Triplicate measurement make time-point . All subject also measure bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) estimation total body water use leg-to-leg BIA machine . To examine within-day between-day variability reliability HM subgroup ( N=25 ) 100 initial subject select . Within-day reliability evaluate take multiple measurement ( 3 ) day . Between-day reliability include measurement ( time ) three consecutive day subgroup 25 subject . BIA measure also include time point within-day between-day .</detailed_description>
