	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer , Non-small Cell Lung Cancer , Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommend stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) dose metastatic location treat give individual overlap field multiple metastasis treat SBRT national clinical trial network set . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate rate &gt; = grade 3 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version ( v. ) 4.0 adverse event dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) possibly , probably , definitely related treatment occur within 6 month start SBRT multiple metastasis . II . To estimate rate long-term adverse event occur 2 year end SBRT . III . To explore appropriate clinically relevant technological parameter ensure quality effectiveness throughout radiation therapy process , include imaging , simulation , patient immobilization , target critical structure definition , treatment planning , image guidance delivery . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3-5 fraction image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy exist metastasis 1-3 week least 40 hour treatment individual metastasis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 35-45 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
