	<brief_summary>Background : &lt; TAB &gt; - Flu virus cause disease bird sometimes spread people . It cause severe illness , even death . Vaccines use try create resistance infection . Researchers want test new vaccination strategy , combine two different vaccine type , H7 DNA Vaccine ( DNA vaccine ) H7N9 Monovalent Inactivated Vaccine ( MIV ) , see one two combination offer good protection certain type bird flu human compare vaccination use two dos MIV alone . Objectives : - To see 2 vaccine bird flu , safe tolerable human . - To study immune response vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 60 year old . Design : - Participants screen separate protocol . - Participants randomly assign 1 3 group . Each group get different combination vaccine . - Participants 8 clinic visit . Each visit take 2 4 hour . Blood drawn visit . Urine sample may collect . - Participants receive vaccination 2 visit , 16 week apart . - The H7N9 MIV inject upper arm use needle syringe . The DNA vaccine inject upper arm use device delivers vaccine skin pressure instead needle . - Participants observe least 30 minute vaccination . - Soon vaccination , participant get 1 2 phone call , come clinic evaluation , complete diary home 1 week . They record temperature symptom look injection site daily . - Participants follow-up blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VRC 315 STUDY : A Phase I Open-Label , Randomized Study H7 Influenza Prime-Boost Regimens Healthy Adults : Recombinant H7 DNA Plasmid Vaccine , VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP , Administered Alone Monovalent Influenza Subunit Virion H7N9 Vaccine ( MIV ) Prime MIV Boost Compared MIV Prime MIV Boost STUDY DESIGN : This Phase I , randomize , open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost vaccination regimen H7N9 Influenza . A vaccination regimen VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP ( H7 DNA ) vaccine administer alone concurrently different arm A/Shanghai/2/2013 ( H7N9 ) ( MIV ) prime follow inactivated MIV boost compare MIV-MIV prime-boost 16 week boost interval . The primary hypothesis H7 DNA prime-MIV boost , DNA+MIV prime-MIV boost , MIV-MIV study regimens safe human administration . A secondary hypothesis H7 DNAMIV regimen elicit great frequency and/or magnitude antibody H7 MIV-MIV regimen . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability healthy adult investigational vaccine regimen . Secondary objective relate immunogenicity vaccination regimen . PRODUCT DESCRIPTION : The investigational VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP vaccine develop VRC , NIAID compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid encodes H7 hemagglutinin ( HA ) protein A/Anhui/1/2013 ( H7N9 ) influenza , supply single dose vial concentration 4 mg/mL . H7 DNA vaccination 4 mg administer 1 mL intramuscularly ( IM ) use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) . The inactivated H7N9 vaccine monovalent subunit virion vaccine , A/Shanghai/2/2013 ( H7N9 ) MIV , manufacture Sanofi Pasteur , Inc ( Swiftwater , PA ) , supply 30 mcg/0.5 mL per vial . The H7N9 MIV vaccination 45 mcg administer 0.75 mL IM injection use needle syringe . All injection deltoid muscle . SUBJECTS : A total 36 healthy adult , age 18-60 year enrol . STUDY PLAN : Subjects randomize equally three study group receive two vaccination show schema . The protocol require 7 clinic visit telephone follow-up contact study injection . Durability immune response follow Study Week 28 . STUDY DURATION : Subjects evaluate safety immune response throughout study 12 week follow boost . Duration time study 28 week .</detailed_description>
