	<brief_summary>The submit proposal design reduce morbidity mortality injured child . Significant variability initial trauma assessment exist among institution . The propose project prospective , observational , multi-institutional study child follow blunt abdominal trauma . The specific goal project : 1 ) Document history , physical exam finding , image , laboratory value , available physician initial trauma resuscitation prior decision whether order abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) evaluate potential intra-abdominal injury ; 2 ) Derive validate multi-variable clinical prediction rule base data variable readily available pediatric trauma resuscitation identify patient low risk intra-abdominal injury , unnecessary CT might safely avoid . Information study could use develop standardized approach evaluation intra-abdominal injury follow blunt trauma child . This information could lead significant improvement early recognition injury improve resource utilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research project prospective , observational study . Data collect institution enter secure REDCap database . Two phase data collection occur : 1 ) patient demographic specific clinical variable may associate IAI available record initial trauma evaluation 2 ) laboratory image result available initial assessment , identify injury , patient disposition , intervention outcome . Primary Outcome Variables : 1 ) Intra-abdominal injury ( IAI ) ( presence solid hollow organ injury ( spleen , liver , kidney , GI tract , adrenal , pancreas , intra-abdominal vascular structure , bladder , ureter , gallbladder , abdominal wall fascia ) ) 2 ) IAI require intervention ( abdominal operation , angio-embolization , blood transfusion ) Time Course : The initial data collection period extend one year . Data record password protect redcap database readily available online participate institution . Study setting : Eleven Level One Pediatric Trauma Centers Data collection point : demographic ( age , mechanism , alert level ) , physical exam , lab ( AST , HCT , amylase , UA , base deficit ) , FAST , image result , injury , outcome ( admission , ICU admit , need intervention , missed injury , ISS ) . Data Analysis : De-identified data use data analysis phase minimize risk loss confidentiality patient . Data analysis development clinical prediction rule ( CPM ) perform follow . A logistic regression use fit predictive model IAI IAI require intervention . SAS 9.3 use statistical analysis . Validation ( include sensitivity negative predictive value ) derive CPM would perform subsequent study use second population patient . Internal validation prediction model assess create split sample use random selection process ; half sample use initial cohort develop prediction model estimate covariates , remain half use validation cohort compare true predict outcome . A receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve create plot sensitivity ( 1- specificity ) different cut-off point predict outcome . A bootstrap study 1000 replication perform level sensitivity , specificity TP/FP/FN/TN validation . Validation ( include sensitivity negative predictive value ) derive CPM would perform subsequent study use second population patient . Quality assurance plan : Data quality evaluate bi-monthly team consist PI , expert clinical prediction model statistician . This panel able review de-identified data institution access make change data enter centralized database . Data check compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency : Data check compare enter registry data predefined rule range consistency perform bi-monthly . Source data verification : Source data collection responsibility individual institution . A data analysis team consist statistician expert clinical prediction model evaluate data bi-monthly look wide outlier ( beyond pre-defined range ) impossible data value ( clinically possible ) request clarification individual institution necessary . Data dictionary contains detailed description variable : The vast majority data collection point discrete variable opportunity `` free text '' data entry . Many variable specifically describe data collection tool . Data definition question individual site address frequently update Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) document send sit bi-monthly follow data verification review . Standard Operating Procedures address registry operation analysis activity : The database establish secure Vanderbilt Redcap web-based site . Individual site data collection analyze review bi-monthly feedback sit data inconsistency exist . Plan miss data address situation variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' interpret , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result : Critical data miss , unavailable report utilized development blunt abdominal trauma clinical prediction model ( BAT CPM ) . The investigator attempt clarification range result prior data analysis . Variables available report less 50 % patient likely exclude CPM form basis practicable risk stratification model . The developed CPM require validation second un-related population prior widespread application CPM .</detailed_description>
