To observe significant improvement hair growth , minoxidil typically used daily period least 24 week . Due significant time commitment low response rate , diagnostic test identify non-responders prior initiate therapy would advantageous . Minoxidil convert scalp active form , minoxidil sulfate , sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1 . The enzyme expression variable among individual . We demonstrate two prior feasibility study SULT1A1 enzyme activity pluck hair follicle correlate minoxidil response treatment AGA thus server predictive biomarker . Consequently , develop minoxidil response in-vitro diagnostic kit intend identify non-responders prior initiate therapy 5 % topical minoxidil foam .</detailed_description>
