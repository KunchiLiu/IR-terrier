	<brief_title>Use Collagen Membrane Soft Tissue Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PriMatrix acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix wide array FDA approve us . These us include partial- full-thickness wound , pressure , diabetic , venous ulcer , surgical wound , trauma wound , tunnel wound , drain wound . It sheet-like matrix make primarily type I type III collagen . An increased proportion type III collagen appear play key role heal regeneration . The use extracellular dermal matrix relatively young field , exact mechanism PriMatrix promote skin regeneration still unknown . Despite , PriMatrix demonstrate difference manufacture molecular composition make conducive harsh environment already test . Intraorally , rich vascular bed , material hold exceed promise . Utilizing vascularity , autogenous free gingival graft palate already efficacy proven method augment keratinize tissue.The need increase keratinize tissue base upon postulation le mobile , keratinized epithelium resilient non-keratinized oral mucosa . This especially important area recession attachment loss already occur . Without keratinize gingiva apical recession area , suggest great risk attachment loss occur , thus reduce support tooth . In addition , autogenous free gingival graft demonstrate phenomenon `` creeping attachment '' portion recession actually become covered result graft . While autogenous graft gold standard soft tissue augmentation , amount tissue take palate limited , make difficult treat patient generalized recession . Furthermore , secondary surgical site increase morbidity associate procedure . The hypothesis study PriMatrix able provide similar result autogenous free gingival graft .</detailed_description>
