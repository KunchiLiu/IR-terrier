	<brief_title>Effects Computer Navigation Versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty Endothelial Damage Marker Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one successful surgery orthopaedic field . However , occasional outliner perfect alignment prosthesis implantation unavoidable complication still concern . The usage navigation-assisted system total knee arthroplasty provide well accuracy component alignment quantity knee kinematics , theoretically affords well consistent functional outcome . In addition well alignment , design navigation system avoids violation medullary canal . This less invasive environment might contributable less blood loss drainage bottle , less blood transfusion stable hemodynamic status , few hospitalization day , few complication . Systemic emboli phenomenon preparation femur tibia well recognize total knee arthroplasty . They widely believe cause intraoperative hypotension reduce cardiac output , may lead circulatory collapse , change mental status cerebral infarction . Kalairajah et al report navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty , compare conventional jig-based surgery , significantly reduce systemic embolus detect transcranial Doppler ultrasonography . Church et al undertook prospective , double-blind , randomize study compare cardiac embolus load tranesophageal echocardiography demonstrate computer-assisted TKA result release significant few systemic emboli conventional procedure use intramedullary alignment . The increased blood loss conventional TKA may due intramedullary jigging femur tibia , bleed sinusoid cut cancellous bone surface continuous suction drainage soft tissue dissection balance prosthesis . The investigator undergo 730 computer-assisted TKA since 2005 . The investigator data show less bleed few transfusion navigation assist TKA . The investigator wish follow-up delineate differential clinical outcome perioperative marker ( include ICAM , VCAM , PECAM cytokine ) computer-assisted TKA conventional TKA .</detailed_description>
