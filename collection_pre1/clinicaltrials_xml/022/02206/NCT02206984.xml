	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Currently , adjuvant endocrine therapy often follow `` one-size-fits- '' approach , premenopausal woman receive tamoxifen , postmenopausal receive aromatase inhibitor therapy . In current clinical practice , patient invasive lobular carcinoma treat differently patient invasive ductal carcinoma base void information specific patient tumor type . Identification biological signal tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity ILC patient would dramatic implication future management breast cancer subtype . PURPOSE : To study whether fulvestrant effective anastrozole tamoxifen reduce Ki67 ILC whether Ki67 reduction correlate alteration expression ER ER-regulated gene . Differential Ki67 effect study serve surrogate outcome ILC patient endocrine therapy . Primary Objective : To determine change baseline post-treatment Ki67 value ER-positive , HER2-negative ILC tissue derive postmenopausal woman await definitive surgery neoadjuvant treatment randomize 21-24 day neoadjuvant endocrine treatment fulvestrant ( two 250 mg IM injection give day 1 ) , anastrozole ( 1mg give orally daily ) , tamoxifen ( 20mg give orally daily ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary To determine change baseline post-treatment Ki67 value ER-positive , HER2-negative ILC tissue derive postmenopausal woman await definitive surgery neoadjuvant treatment randomize 21-24 day neoadjuvant endocrine treatment fulvestrant ( two 250 mg IM injection give day 1 ) , anastrozole ( 1mg give orally daily ) , tamoxifen ( 20mg give orally daily ) . Secondary - To evaluate ER protein expression ILC tissue baseline follow neoadjuvant endocrine therapy . - To evaluate PR protein expression ILC tissue baseline follow neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy . - To evaluate ER-related ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression ILC tissue baseline follow neoadjuvant endocrine therapy effort identify biomarkers endocrine response putative driver endocrine resistance ILC . - To evaluate association change Ki67 ILC tissue follow neoadjuvant endocrine therapy ER PR protein expression , ER candidate gene mRNA expression baseline post-treatment . Exploratory - To evaluate DNA methylation ILC tissue baseline follow neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy . - To evaluate association germline somatic DNA sequence variant change Ki67 ILC tissue follow neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy . - To evaluate activity signal pathway ILC tissue immunohistochemical protein analysis , histone modification , baseline follow neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm invasive lobular breast cancer hormone receptorpositive HER2negative , measure least 1 centimeter ( cm ) radiographically clinically , clinical stage IIII . Invasive lobular histology diagnose enrol institution purpose study participation . Subsequently , invasive lobular histology confirm central pathology review , central review require prior patient enrollment . Prior initiation study agent , study participant must agree baseline research core biopsy , definitive surgery perform day 2124 treatment , second posttreatment research core biopsy . For patient undergo surgery , second biopsy remove tissue excise operation . Hormone receptor ( HR ) status invasive component must document diagnostic core biopsy trial enrollment . The tumor must ERpositive . ER consider positive stain 1 % great . This determine enrol institution purpose study participation enrollment onto trial . Subsequently , HR status confirm central pathology review , central review require prior enrol patient . Patients must female Participants must fully postmenopausal ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mm3 absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 total bilirubin within normal laboratory limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 time laboratory upper limit normal creatinine within normal laboratory limit Prior use hormone contraceptive replacement therapy allow ( e.g. , estrogen and/or progestin ) , must discontinue least 30 day prior diagnostic biopsy . Vaginal preparation ( e.g. , Vagifem® Estring® ) allow . Participant must aware nature malignancy , understand study requirement risk able willing sign write informed consent document . Prior concurrent use hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , novel therapy treat current breast cancer , include history prior irradiation ipsilateral breast . Concurrent use investigational agent . History allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition tamoxifen , anastrozole , fulvestrant ingredient . History thromboembolic disease uterine cancer consider contraindication tamoxifen . Active hepatitis viral infection . Uncontrolled current illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HER2 positivity .</criteria>
