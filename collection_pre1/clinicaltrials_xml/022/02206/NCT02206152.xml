	<brief_summary>This single center , double blind randomize cross design trial compare impact N-acetyl cysteine ( 200 mg ) vs. saline infusion experimental hypoglycemia day one responses experimental hypoglycemia day two . 18 participant study twice , 8 week apart . On occasion undergo 2 hour hypoglycemic clamp ( target 50 mg/dl ) morning afternoon day one morning day 2 day 3 . During morning clamp , sample collect later measurement serum epinephrine level , plasma red blood cell NAC , cysteine , glutathione concentration GSH/GSSG ratio ( redox status ) , participant ask complete hypoglycemia symptom questionnaire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Double Blinded Study Examine Use N-acetyl Cysteine Prevention Treatment HAAF Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist screen visit two 2-day intervention visit separate approximately 8 week . At screen visit , informed consent obtain , standardized form use ensure subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , baseline hemoglobin A1c obtain . On arrival , two IVs place randomize receive NAC saline infusion . Baseline blood sample draw glucose , epinephrine , norepinephrine , cortisol , cysteine glutathione measurement . Subjects give 25 mg IV diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) follow 60 minute infusion NAC ( 150 mg ) similar volume saline 8 9 , follow four hour infusion 50 mg NAC . Thirty minute start NAC infusion , hyperinsulinemic ( 2.0 mu/kg/min ) hypoglycemic ( target = 50 mg/dl ) clamp protocol start . During morning study , blood sample collect every 5 minute monitor blood glucose level every 15 minute later measurement serum epinephrine , norepinephrine , cortisol . Plasma red blood cell sample also collect every 15 minute later measurement NAC , cysteine , glutathione , GSH/GSSG ratio ( redox status ) . During final 15 minute morning clamp , subject ask quantitate symptom use standardized method ( 13 ) . At completion morning clamp , glucose give return participant euglycemia . 2 hour end morning clamp , second hyperinsulinemic ( 2.0 mu/kg/min ) hypoglycemic ( target = 50 mg/dl ) clamp protocol follow two hour . . The afternoon clamp study proceed morning except serum plasma collect except monitor glucose collection sample subsequent measurement NAC , cysteine , glutathione , GSH/GSSG ratio . After completion afternoon clamp , subject return euglycemia fed meal . They discharge home . At 7 AM follow morning single 2 hour hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic step clamp ( 75 , 65 , 55,45 mg/dl target ) blood sample collect morning day 1 . Symptom score collect final 15 minute step clamp . At completion study day 2 Part 1 , schedule return Part 2 8 week . This timing select ensure female participant study phase menstrual cycle . During Part 2 receive treatment provide Part 1 blind fashion . The rest study protocol Part 1 .</detailed_description>
