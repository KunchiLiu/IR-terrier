	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria disease affect many people Mali Africa . It cause germ spread mosquito bite . Researchers create vaccine hope prevent malaria infection and/or spread . Objective : - To test PfSPZ vaccine stop malaria spread mosquito . Eligibility : - People currently enrol ongoing PfSPZ malaria vaccine trial . Participants must willing uninfected mosquito bite . Design : - Participants able take part study every visit receive schedule vaccination . - Participants ask whether willing participate procedure . Female participant pregnancy test . - Researchers put 60 mosquito 2 3 cup ( 20 30 cup ) . They hold cup participant leg arm mosquito bite . These mosquito carry germ take 3 drop blood total . - Participants get cream swell itching . - Participants check next day discomfort . - Participants may take part feed test multiple time , willing . - If participant malaria parasite blood , may ask take part another study . For , sleep alone hut night feed test . A study team set net collect mosquito may bite participant overnight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Human-to-Mosquito Transmission Volunteers Participating Malaria Vaccine Candidate Trials Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vaccine interrupt malaria transmission ( VIMT ) critical tool achieve ultimate goal eradication disease . VIMTs work induce humoral response vaccinate individual inhibit development malaria parasite mosquito , combine humoral cellular response inhibit establishment infection human . Overall efficacy vaccine evaluate measure reduction infection clinical case among vaccinee parasite infectivity mosquito , ( human-to-mosquito transmissibility ) , vaccination , without vaccination . One candidate VIMTs , PfSPZ Vaccine , currently test Mali safety , tolerance , immunogenicity . The objective Feeding Assay Protocol explore effect PfSPZ Vaccine , interrupt human-to-mosquito transmission . Individuals PfSPZ Vaccine trial 2014 also consent enrol Feeding Assay Protocol eligible participate procedure include direct skin feed ( DSF ) experimental hut ( EH ) . The human-to-mosquito transmission evaluate examine presence malaria parasites midgut mosquito feed study participant . The human-to-mosquito transmission DSF EH assay method analyze potential correlation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Currently enrol PfSPZ Vaccine trial . Willingness participate study evidence sign informed consent document , fingerprint consent document obtain signature witness . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Refusal participate Known history abnormal reaction mosquito bite Any condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety right volunteer participate DSF EH procedure would render volunteer unable comply Feeding Assay Protocol . Pregnancy Any condition opinion investigator would withdraw volunteer vaccine trial .</criteria>
