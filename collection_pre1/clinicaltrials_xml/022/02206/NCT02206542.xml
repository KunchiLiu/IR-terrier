	<brief_summary>Disability upper limb due neurologic orthopedic disorder injury commonly see clinically . For example paralysis paresis upper limb due stroke relatively prevalent , may result severe muscle weakness , pain , contracture , spasticity disability . These patient need early regular rehabilitation regain function prevent unnecessary complication contracture disuse atrophy . Proper rehabilitation important challenge also great . However , rehabilitation train labor-intensive task one one treatment essential restrict number patient serve . Moreover , patient receive home program difficult supervise , result reduced training effect delay functional recovery . In order reduce relate cost ( include time , personnel , facility , expense , etc . ) rehabilitation hospital clinic , Robot research team develop prototype upper-limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot related technology human-robot interaction . This robot use serve rehabilitation need patient suffer upper extremity dysfunction also provide careful design therapeutic program upper limbs include shoulder elbow joint exercise . Its control software also provide therapeutic management system intelligence ergonomic consideration . This work fund National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) since 2008 apply U.S. Taiwan ( ROC ) patent , latter approve Nov. 2011 . The clinical trial firstly approve Research Ethics Committee B NTUH 2009 finally approve Department Health ( DOH ) April 2011 . This team complete clinical trial healthy subject pre-clinical trial stroke patient . Based upon experience innovative intelligent SMART Robot Rehabilitation System Frozen Shoulder Syndrome propose prove safety , efficacy , cost-effectiveness .</brief_summary>
