	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct research study see increase amount nitrate ( substance find large quantity certain vegetable ) diet increase ability individual Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) perform exercise . Some people T2D find exercise uncomfortable individual T2D . This may explain experimental study show T2D result reduction supply oxygen muscle . Studies also show give level activity , individual T2D much close maximum exercise capacity healthy individual . Dietary nitrate may two important beneficial effect individual T2D : 1 ) The effect dietary nitrate response exercise may significant impact ability individual Type 2 diabetes perform daily task exercise comfortably 2 ) experimental study suggest increase nitrate consumption show reduce amount oxygen require give level exercise . The investigator recruit 60 individual T2D . These people take part randomise crossover design study ask drink normal beetroot juice ( rich nitrate ) nitrate deplete beetroot juice , prior perform two different walk exercise task ( six minute walk repeat , low intensity treadmill walk ) . This study aim determine dietary nitrate supplementation reduces amount oxygen require give level exercise individual T2D . To test brain function individual ask perform standard computerise decision make task follow consumption nitrate rich nitrate deplete juice .</brief_summary>
