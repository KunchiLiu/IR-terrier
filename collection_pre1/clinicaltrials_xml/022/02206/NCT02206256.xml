	<brief_summary>Gastric bypass surgery gold standard bariatric surgery successful method reduce weight morbidly obese subject . Patients qualify gastric bypass surgery routinely pre-treated low calorie diet order reduce liver volume facilitate approach gastro-oesophageal junction . Pre-treatment omega-3 fatty acid similar effect liver volume , prospective comparison treatment perform yet . Morbidly obese patient respond differently surgical stress , due number factor . First , obesity associate low-grade inflammatory state induce increased amount macrophage adipose tissue . This state associate high level pro-inflammatory cytokine serum less adequate immune response infection . Second , obesity associate alter cortisol metabolism possibly related adrenal insufficiency . This could play important role alter response surgical stress postoperative complication obese subject . Third , obesity associate alter erythrocyte function , include decrease erythrocyte deformability increase aggregation , factor contribute impaired microcirculation . This study number different aim . First , compare pre-treatment standard low calorie diet omega-3 fatty acid liver volume patient qualify gastric bypass surgery morbid obesity . Second , investigate effect omega-3 fatty acid immune function , low-inflammatory state adipose tissue , stress response obese subject erythrocyte function . Third , investigate effect gastric bypass surgery compare value surgery value first postoperative day 6 month surgery regard immunological parameter , stress response erythrocyte function .</brief_summary>
