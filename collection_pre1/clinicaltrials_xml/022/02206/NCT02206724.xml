	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator investigator previously document safety efficacy definitive intent stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) treatment localized prostate cancer . In metastatic setting multiple malignancy , improve survival rate disease outcomes show definitive treatment primary disease site . This concept `` cytoreductive '' surgery decrease primary tumor burden consider standard care metastatic colon , ovarian , renal cell , breast carcinoma ( plus post-surgery irradiation ) . With new guideline decline rate PSA screening , incidence newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer expect increase . A recent population-based study conclude significant improvement definitive treatment local prostate cancer stage IV set either radical prostatectomy conventional prostate radiation treatments/brachytherapy . To knowledge , one prospective phase II trial currently accrue patient best systemic therapy best systemic therapy ( BST ) plus definitive treatment either radical prostatectomy conventionally fractionate radiation therapy The investigator hypothesize addition primary disease SBRT best systemic therapy newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer would associate acceptable safety profile , quality life , disease progression , overall survival . The addition SBRT best systemic therapy also expect better-received stage IV patient ( relatively limited prognosis ) , vs. fully fractionate radiation therapy , brachytherapy , radical prostatectomy . The endpoint would initially test prospective phase II multi-institutional trial comparison historical control .</detailed_description>
