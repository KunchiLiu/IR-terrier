	<brief_summary>Postural-suprapostural task define postural control take place least one concurrent task perform , appropriate locus attentional allocation consider critical factor successful postural-suprapostural execution . Recent study indicate behavior performance postural-suprapostural task would affect prioritization attentional allocation ( postural-first vs. suprapostural-first ) ; however , inference appropriateness attention prioritization primarily limit behavior observation lack direct neural evidence . How effect attentional priority postural suprapostural task postural-suprapostural performance underlie cortical mechanism rarely understood . By adopt postural-first suprapostural-first strategy postural-suprapostural task , purpose 2-year research project 1 ) investigate difference performance quality intrinsic neural mechanism effect postural-suprapostural task healthy adult analysis event-related potential ( ERP ) non-linear dynamic behavior measure ; 2 ) investigate brain plastic change appropriateness strategy use . In first year , attention prioritization effect reciprocity postural-suprapostural task characterize integrate result behavior performance ERP causal connectivity special focus validation prevail theoretical model . In second year , difference task fluent learn postural-suprapostural task postural-first/suprapostural-first strategy study spatial time variation alpha rhythm principle component analysis . The present project expect significant contribution gain good insight neural correlate concurrent postural motor suprapostural task , optimize treatment strategy patient balance multi-tasking disturbance .</brief_summary>
