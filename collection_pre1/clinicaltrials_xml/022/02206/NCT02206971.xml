	<brief_title>Biomarker Feedback Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The smoking pattern among adult US undergo remarkable change . A substantial proportion smoker light smoker ( smoke â‰¤ 10 cigarette per day ) , yet little known help light smoker quit . The prevalence light smoke high ( ~50 % ) among African Americans ( AAs ) compare group high cotinine level , less successful quit smoking , experience disproportionately high smoking-related cancer . Because light smoker often think smoke few cigarette day safe , potential smoking cessation strategy therefore provide light smoker feedback biomarkers tobacco exposure increase cancer risk . The objective proposal develop pilot test biomarker risk assessment intervention enhance smoke cessation AA light smoker . The proposal build previous work show light smoker 1 ) difficulty quit smoking , 2 ) low perceive health risk , high level biomarkers ( e.g . cotinine ) . This study occur 2 phase . Phase 1 utilize focus group examine prevail knowledge , attitude , belief biomarkers well preference participant would like receive biomarker feedback ( BF ; e.g . mail , phone , in-person ) . In Phase 2 , data focus group use develop ( BF ) intervention light smoker . The new intervention undergo feasibility evaluation among 60 adult light smoker . Outcomes Phase 2 include process measure , ( e.g . perceived usefulness , acceptance , adherence ) change biomarker value smoke reduction cessation . By end propose pilot study , expect develop replicable , feasible , acceptable BF intervention ready efficacy test large clinical trial smoke cessation smoking reduction . The aims application : 1 ) Examine prevail knowledge , attitude , belief , preference BF smoke cessation among AA light smoker ; 2 ) Develop BF intervention smoke cessation among AA light smoker ; 3 ) Test feasibility BF intervention smoke cessation AA light smoker .</detailed_description>
