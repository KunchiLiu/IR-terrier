	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide With Biochemical Progression During Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol phase II multicenter , open label study design determine whether addiction Cyclophosphamide Rd ( CRd ) treatment significantly increase response rate prolong outcome ( PFS , OS ) patient experience biochemical relapse , without CRAB Rd treatment . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 3 study period : pre-treatment , treatment long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) . The pre-treatment period include : screening visit , perform study entry . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient evaluate study eligibility . The screening period include availability inclusion criterion describe . Subjects meet inclusion criterion enrol . The treatment period include : administration combination CRd 9 cycle . In order ass efficacy safety treatment , patient attend study center visit least every 2 week . The response assess cycle . During LTFU period , development confirm progression disease ( PD ) , patient follow survival every 1-3 month via telephone office visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient relapse/refractory multiple myeloma experience biochemical progression , without CRAB , treatment Rd . CRAB mean presence organ damage , multiple myeloma relate ( renal impairment and/or anemia and/or new bone lesion and/or hypercalcemia ) . It sufficient one previous sign define presence CRAB . Biochemical progression mean : positivization serum/urine immunofixation patient reach complete remission Rd treatment least 25 % increment monoclonal component serum/urine patient reach least stable disease ( SD ) . Patient expose previous therapy include Lenalidomide , Thalidomide , Bortezomib and/or autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) treatment Rd . Patient , investigator ( ) opinion , willing able comply protocol requirement . Patient give voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Female patient either postmenopausal surgically sterilize , childbearing potential , must : understand study medication could expect teratogenic risk . Agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption , 4 week start study drug , throughout study drug therapy ( include dose interruption ) 4 week end study drug therapy , even amenorrhea . This apply unless subject commits absolute continued abstinence confirm monthly basis . The following effective method contraception* : Implant** Levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system ( IUS ) ** Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot Tubal sterilisation Sexual intercourse vasectomise male partner ; vasectomy must confirm two negative semen analyse Ovulation inhibitory progesteroneonly pill ( i.e. , desogestrel ) Combined oral contraceptive pill recommend . If subject use combined oral contraception , must switch one method . The increase risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) continue 4 6 week stop combined oral contraception . **prophylactic antibiotic consider time insertion particularly patient neutropenia due risk infection . Agree medically supervise pregnancy test minimum sensitivity 25 mill International Units milliliter ( mIU/ml ) 3 day start study medication subject effective contraception least 4 week . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . Agree medically supervise pregnancy test every 4 week include 4 week end study treatment , except case confirm tubal sterilization . These test perform 3 day start next treatment . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . † A female subject female partner male subject consider childbearing potential unless meet least one follow criterion : Age ≥50 year naturally amenorrhoeic ≥ 1 year ( amenorrhoea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) , premature ovarian failure confirm specialist gynaecologist , previous bilateral salpingooophorectomy hysterectomy , xy genotype , Turner 's syndrome uterine agenesis . Male subject must : Agree use condom throughout study drug therapy , dose interruption one week cessation study therapy partner childbearing potential contraception . Agree donate semen study drug therapy one week end study drug therapy . All subject must : Agree abstain donate blood take study drug therapy one week follow discontinuation study drug therapy . Agree share study medication another person return unused study drug investigator . Patient obtain least SD Rd treatment experience biochemical progression without CRAB , treatment . Patient Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % . Patient lifeexpectancy &gt; 6 month . Patients must adequate cardiac function . Patients must adequate pulmonary function . Patient follow laboratory value within 14 day Baseline ( day 1 Cyclophosphamide ) : Platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L ≥ 25 109/L bone marrow involvement ≥ 50 % plasma cell bone marrow biopsy . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L ≥ 0,5 109/L x bone marrow involvement ≥ 50 % plasma cell bone marrow biopsy . Corrected serum calcium ≤ 14 mg/dL ( 3.5 mmol/L ) . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) : ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) : ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Total bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Calculated measured creatinine clearance : ≥ 30 mL/minute . Patients newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Patients relapse multiple myeloma sign organ damage relate disease ( CRAB ) . Any serious medical condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk participates study confounds experimental ability interpret data study . Pregnant lactate female . Prior history malignancy , multiple myeloma , unless subject free disease ≥ 3 year . Exceptions include follow : Basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , carcinoma situ breast , incidental histological finding prostate cancer ( TNM stage T1a T1b ) .</criteria>
