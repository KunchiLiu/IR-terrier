	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose protocol understand social factor psychosocial stress may modify people respond air pollution . Ultimately help u understand health disparity poor air quality . Participants : Up 40 healthy adults,18-33 year old different perception stress participate complete study . Procedures ( method ) : Subjects expose clean air ozone ( 300ppb ) 2 hour control environment chamber . Cardiac , vascular , pulmonary cognitive function evaluate pre , immediately post 18 hr post exposure . The primary endpoint Heart Rate Variability . Secondary endpoint include pulmonary function , analysis blood clotting/coagulation factor , biomarkers stress , cognitive function , radial artery pulse wave measurement analysis soluble factor present plasma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past decade , air quality U.S. improve significantly . Even , million people U.S. still live county meet air quality standard one pollutant . Ozone major component photochemical smog one thoroughly study gaseous pollutant . Controlled human exposure study critical demonstrating cause airway inflammation 1-3 , include increase neutrophil infiltration lung production pro-inflammatory mediator 4,5 [ , ultimately decrements lung function [ review 6 ] . More recent study show ozone also increase vascular inflammation , well alter autonomic nervous system control heart rate cardiac repolarization 7 . Numerous epidemiological study also demonstrate association acute chronic exposure ambient level ozone various health effect notably asthma 6 . These study also highlight need incorporate social nonchemical factor risk assessment 8 . Similarly , social factor psychological stress regard important contributor asthma outcomes 9,10 . This protocol aim investigate stress impact health response air pollutant . Since psychosocial stress-related susceptibility propose explain social disparity , help u understand population individual increase risk air pollution . This protocol design determine whether nonchemical stressor exacerbate ozone effect . In particular focus elevate psychosocial stress show contribute several adverse health outcome , notably , cardiovascular disease . The physiological mechanism psychosocial stress lead health effect due , least part , elevate circulate glucocorticoid , stress hormone , regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) . In last 30 year concept allostasis evolve . Allostasis process whereby organism adapt demand environment . An allostatic load model applies concept chronic stress11 . In model perception threat long time interval ( perceived stress ) cause over-activation HPA-axis resulting change physiological system chemical imbalance autonomic nervous system , central nervous system , neuroendocrine , immune system activity . Factors genetics , behavior , life event diet impact model . To knowledge clinical study investigate link air pollution effect cardiovascular disease psychosocial stress . However , several study show association stress respiratory outcomes air pollution . Claugherty colleague ( 2007 ) find association traffic-related air pollution asthma solely among child expose violence 12 . Shankardass colleague demonstrate child stressful household susceptible effect traffic-related pollution development asthma 13 . In study , stress evaluate use Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) develop Dr. Sheldon Cohen Carnegie Mellon University . This widely use psychological instrument measure perception stress validate multiple study . We use scale evaluate degree subject appraise situation life stressful . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) consider reliable biomarker stress . Chronic stress show associated decrease HRV 14 . Since acute ozone exposure also cause change HRV , choose HRV primary endpoint . We hypothesize imbalance sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system cause chronic stress result alter response ozone exposure reflect HRV .</detailed_description>
