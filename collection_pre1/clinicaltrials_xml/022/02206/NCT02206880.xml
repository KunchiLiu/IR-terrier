	<brief_title>The Delirium-CS Canada Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium acute confusional state characterize fluctuate mental status , inattention , either disorganize thinking alter level consciousness . It long recognize complication cardiac surgery , condition likely experience among elderly patient great comorbid disease burden . In recent year , increase attention pay negative effect delirium post-operative outcome , include long-term survival , freedom hospital readmission reduce cognitive functional recovery . Despite , little still know true incidence delirium follow cardiac surgery , publish rate delirium post-cardiac surgery range widely 3 % - 78 % . From September 1 , 2014 November 30 , 2014 , ALL patient undergo cardiac surgery participate center screen post-operative delirium . Patients NOT exclude basis urgency procedure type . Delirium screen conduct either 7 day follow date surgery date initial discharge intensive care unit , whichever come first . Each center allow employ delirium-screening tool currently use institution provide tool either Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit ( CAM-ICU ) . It intend either ICDSC CAM-ICU , pair Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) Riker Sedation Agitation Scale ( SAS ) administer per shift ( i.e . first assessment morning second assessment begin even shift ) . In addition , data regard baseline demographic clinical characteristic collect well data regard procedure perform ( see Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Patients consider post-operative delirium result least one screening test administer yielded positive finding delirium . In addition report overall rate delirium , unadjusted adjust incidence rate delirium report institution entire cohort . Risk-adjustment perform use multivariate regression model technique . This study first report incidence rate delirium follow cardiac surgery across multiple center employ standardized screening methodology . The result study provide valuable insight true burden delirium among patient undergone cardiac surgical procedure current era . This first step create multifaceted delirium prevention/treatment clinical pathway cardiac surgery patient .</detailed_description>
