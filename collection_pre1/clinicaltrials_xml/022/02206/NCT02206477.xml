	<brief_summary>Capsular contraction one common complication esthetic reconstructive breast surgery , high incidence radiotherapy . The mechanism contraction unclear , believe similar formation hypertrophic scarring . Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) demonstrate use anti-inflammatory , anti-proliferative , antibacterial agent . The aim study test effect DMSO incidence severity capsular contracture breast alloplastic reconstruction irradiate patient . We conduct prospective randomized-control single-surgeon study tertiary academic Rabin Medical Center . 110 female candidate mastectomy , radiotherapy immediate two-stage reconstruction include . They divide two group : DMSO treatment group , treat accord protocol , control group , treat protocol 0.9 % saline instead . Several measure take , include : capsular contracture grade two plastic surgeon , VAS-score breast pain , maximal capsular thickness ( MCT ) sonography evaluation , pathology examination capsule ( biopsy take second stage operation ) . Rates grade capsular contracture evident clinically , radiologically pathologically , evaluate compare .</brief_summary>
