The effectiveness MHTraining-Net measure agency 's adherence Depression CAREPATH protocol depress patient change patient ' depressive symptom episode care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Homecare Agency-Randomized Trial Web Implementation Strategy Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MHTraining-Net us web-based platform several long distance tool ( e.g. , e-learning module , telephone web consultation , telephone call , toolkits , discussion board ) deliver four type implementation activity : infrastructure development , train education , quality improvement , social networking . MHTraining-Net develop ensure Depression CAREPATH ( CARE PATients Home ) , specifically , evidence-based practice , generally , implement widely successfully across independent organization within sector care . PROCEDURES : The effectiveness MHTraining-Net implementation Depression CAREPATH test agency-randomized trial 160 HHAs . All HHAs client Brightree ( formerly CareAnyware , Inc ) , software company offer web-based point-of-care clinical management administrative support HHA nationwide . HHA clinicians record relevant data transmit directly Brightree clinical administrative purpose , include quality improvement initiative . As part HHA 's contract Brightree permission use data performance enhancement research . Brightree already program Cornell 's Depression CAREPATH , depression care management protocol , clinical management system nurse use protocol . To promote use protocol , Brightree post two relevant video ( archive Patient Health Questionnaire-9 training web seminar training ) ; demonstration navigate protocol within software ) user education website . Brightree randomize HHAs either MHTraining-Net , ( N=100 ) Enhanced Support ( N=60 ) . Enhanced Support access two training video end study invite MHTraining-Net . These procedure represent Brightree 's typical `` roll-out '' approach introduce new training product client HHAs . The study test hypothesis use three set data : 1 . Summary statistic describe size type 160 HHAs well average nurse productivity 12 month precede follow study ; 2 . Routinely collected administrative data patient age &gt; 65 screen positive depression one year , include Medicare-mandated assessment , medication list , transaction file , indicator whether depression care management protocol use , Medicare case-mix adjustment reimbursement indicator . We use term 'patients ' refer full episode patient care , define Start-of-Care date Discharge , recognize small proportion unique individual may one full episode care . We able identify individual . These data aggregate patient level preparation performance enhancement analyse use Brightree 's routine procedure . Brightree code data , remove identifier , transmit Weill Cornell regular basis use Weill Cornell ITS Department secure server protocols . 3 . Agency-level data use MHTraining-Net website ( e.g. , summary report 'hits ' webpage ) agency-initiated contact ( telephone , email ) record maintain Cornell project staff .</detailed_description>
