	<detailed_description>Cervical radicular pain common cause disability pain upper extremity neck annual incidence 83.2/100,000 ( 1 ) . The initial treatment conservative include relative rest , use anti-inflammatory analgesic medication , well physical therapy home exercise . For patient persistent significant symptom , interventional pain management surgical management consider . Cervical epidural injection mainstay interventional , non-surgical modality . They consider provide short long-term relief disc herniation , foraminal stenosis central canal stenosis pathology identify . Cervical epidural injection perform two different approach , transforaminal interlaminar . Transforaminal epidural injection allow delivery medication ventral epidural space , interlaminar approach reach ventral epidural space 28 % injection ( 2-4 ) . The result cervical epidural injection remain controversial efficacy decrease need surgery patient would otherwise operative candidate thoroughly investigate . Studies limit small sample size , lack control group , lack randomization . Kolstad et al report 23 % ( 5/21 ) patient wait cervical disc surgery cancel surgery assess four month series two cervical epidural injection ( 6 ) . Lin et al report 63 % ( 44/70 ) patient deem surgical candidate able avoid surgery average 13-month follow ( 7 ) . Lee et al report 80 % 98 patient evaluated cervical radiculopathy able avoid surgery 2-year follow-up ( 8 ) . Anderberg et al report short-term difference symptom cervical radiculopathy patient receive transforaminal injection steroid local anesthetic versus saline local anesthetic . However , study evaluate whether injection successful patient avoid surgery ( 11 ) . In term lumbar transforaminal epidural injection , Riew et al demonstrate steroid injection obviate need surgery patient lumbar radiculopathy . Moreover , Reiw et al show steroid combined local anesthetic effective local anesthetic alone prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded study ( 9 ) . Riew et al later study efficacy cervical transforaminal epidural injection fashion , finding statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.35 ) publish ( 10 ) . We aware publish prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded study demonstrate efficacy cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injection . However , North American Spine Society ( NASS ) Review Recommendation Statement state base literature expert opinion , minimum one two cervical epidural steroid injection would appropriate treatment specific episode cervical radicular pain . This literature also suggest maximum four injection use within six month , assume positive response improvement see previous injection .</detailed_description>
