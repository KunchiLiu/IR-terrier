	<brief_summary>Thickening heart muscle ( left ventricle ) know medically Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ( LVH ) common patient heart disease . This increase risk cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event . LVH asymptomatic manage use medication control blood pressure , however LVH may see normotensive patient factor obesity insulin resistance present . Insulin resistance condition although body produce insulin unable utilize effectively . Metformin , drug use treat diabetes , reduce insulin resistance cause weight loss , may therefore improve LVH . This study investigate ability metformin reduce LVH patient heart disease , may novel way forward risk reduction cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event . Participants identify throughout NHS Tayside , eligible randomly allocate either metformin dummy medication ( placebo ) receive one year treatment . At begin study , thickness heart muscle measure ultrasound scan cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( cMRI ) . We also perform non-invasive test measure blood vessel function . These test repeat one year . At end study , investigate difference placebo treatment metformin treatment . This study fund British Heart Foundation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre trial design investigate benefit , , 12 month metformin XL 2000mg/day treatment leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) 64 nondiabetic participant Ischaemic heart disease ( IHD ) insulin resistance ( IR ) . Participants see seven occasion : screening , baseline/randomisation , 2 week post randomisation , month 1 , month 4 , month 8 final month 12 , vital sign safety blood perform . There also three telephone visit : month 2 , month 6 month 10 . At screen visit initial history perform follow informed consent . Participants undergo echocardiogram ( painless ultrasound scan heart ) Department Clinical Pharmacology , Ninewells Hospital , Dundee . Blood pressure record blood test determine fast insulin resistance index ( FIRI ) routine safety , prior metformin administration , perform . Participants meet inclusion criterion return randomisation visit within 4 week screen Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( cMRI ) scan perform follow randomisation either Metformin XL placebo double blind , randomise fashion . Also , visit endothelial function test perform assess peripheral blood vessel forearm , central obesity quantify use waist circumference waist hip ratio ( WHR ) study specific blood sampling perform ( participant consent ) . At final visit early withdrawal follow perform : vital sign , safety blood , study specific blood ( participant consent ) , echocardiography , endothelial function test cMRI . In active arm , therapy metformin XL initial dose 1000mg/day ( metformin XL 500mg x2/day ) . Participants continue Metformin XL 500mg x2/day two week , follow safety blood check dose increased 2000 mg/day . If high dose tolerate reduced 1000mg/day ( stop tolerate ) . The target dose metformin XL 2000mg/day chosen base previous study metformin nondiabetic heart failure patient IR , study demonstrate beneficial effect metformin insulin resistance , weight reduction improvement submaximal exercise . The study use immediate release form metformin ( target 1000 mg x2/day ) associate significant gastrointestinal side effect result 13 % withdrawal study medication . For reason select metformin XR due improve gastrointestinal tolerability .</detailed_description>
