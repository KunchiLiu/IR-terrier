	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy Dietary Buglossoides Oil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , comparator-controlled , double-blind study healthy subject . Forty subject randomly assign 2 supplementation group ( n=20 per group ) . One group consume 10 ml Buglossoides oil daily one group consume 10 ml flax seed oil daily 4 week period . Baseline data obtain week 0 . Subjects return clinic 2 week 4 week measurement safety efficacy endpoint . The efficacy parameter statistically significant change baseline group plasma , red blood cell leukocyte omega-3 fatty acid content . The primary efficacy endpoint : Plasma EPA concentration express μmol/L plasma . The secondary efficacy endpoint : 1 . Plasma 20:4n-3 DPA individually μmol/L ; 2 . Plasma 20:4n-3 , EPA DPA individually % total fatty acid ; 3 . Erythrocyte 20:4n-3 , EPA DPA individually % total fatty acid ; 4 . Mononuclear cell 20:4n-3 , EPA DPA individually % total fatty acid ; 5 . Neutrophil 20:4n-3 , EPA DPA individually % total fatty acid ; 6 . The omega-3 index ( define sum red blood cell EPA DHA concentration ) , express % total fatty acid . Safety endpoint : 1. fast serum chemistry 2. fast hematology profile 3. fasting blood lipid profile</detailed_description>
