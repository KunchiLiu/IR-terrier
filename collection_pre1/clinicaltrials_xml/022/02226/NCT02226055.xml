	<brief_summary>1 . We hypothesise CKDu patient increase arterial stiffness thus increase all-cause cardiovascular mortality . The first objective study recruit cohort ~ 50 CKDu patient attend CKDu clinic Anuradhapura , measure arterial stiffness use TensioMed® Arteriograph™ ( detail ) . We recruit age , sex blood pressure match control group healthy Sri Lankans ( consent visitor patient clinic inpatient ) , possible , second control group , similarly age , sex blood pressure match , CKD know cause attend general renal clinic Anuradhapura . 2 . We hypothesise detailed renal analysis give insight aetiology CKDu North Central Province Sri Lanka . The second objective study recruit 250 CKDu patient characterize disease profile use analysis serum urine renal biomarkers , exosomes , proteomics DNA adduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Into Cardiovascular Risk Aetiology CKDu Sri Lanka</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) one lead cause hospital admission , clinic attendance mortality province Sri Lanka . In central southern province increase incidence attribute type-2 diabetes hypertension ; however , case North Central Province ( NCP ) CKD unknown aetiology ( CKDu ) common diagnosis . A recent World Health Organisation ( WHO ) investigation conclude least 8,000 people CKDu2 . First recognize early ninety , much work do try characterise disease however result conflict . Most suggest male paddy farmer work rural area NCP worst affect , present fifth decade end stage renal failure . However , recent WHO study reveal high prevalence female , although severe renal impairment common men . Risk factor include inhabit NCP &gt; five year , inhabit 'dry zone ' , reduce BMI , low socio-economic class , exposure agrochemicals . There suggestion genetic link although positive family history limit one generation , evidence mendelian progression . Epidemiological study reveal clustered geographical distribution area Medawachchiya , Padaviya Girandurukotte affect . High prevalence area encompass well-developed irrigation system use agricultural purpose . Renal biopsy show tubulointerstitial disease tubular atrophy , interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration , interstitial fibrosis immune-complex deposition immunofluorescence . This support toxin-mediated process . Many aetiology consider include exposure heavy metal ( cadmium , arsenic ) chelation herbicide , fluro-aluminium complex , agricultural pesticide , mycotoxin , herbal medicine . Selenium deficiency genetic susceptibility may predispose factor . The true aetiology likely multifactorial . The multi-system impact CKDu yet fully realise . Epidemiological clinical data show damage large artery contributes increase cardiovascular risk observe CKD . Atherosclerosis frequent cause arterial damage medial calcification see CKD also lead arterial stiffening . This stiffening cause elevation systolic blood pressure , increase leave ventricular workload gradual development LVH , also fall diastolic blood pressure impair coronary blood flow . Arterial calcification stiffness independent predictor all-cause cardiovascular mortality patient CKD . Arterial stiffness compare CKDu patient , healthy Sri Lankan control CKD patient Sri Lanka Scotland . We perform prospective observational study 250 patient CKDu present renal clinic Teaching Hospital , Anuradhapura . Patient history , basic anthropometric measurement , simple non-invasive test ( e.g . blood pressure arterial stiffness ) perform . Urine , serum plasma sample collect quantitative PCR , analysis biomarkers renal injury , exosomes , proteomics DNA-adducts . Patients grade use WHO CKDu grade system . When renal biopsy perform , copy light microscopy finding obtain . Comparisons interest test via paired t-tests statistical significance take 5 % .</detailed_description>
