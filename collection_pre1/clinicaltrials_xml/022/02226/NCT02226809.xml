	<detailed_description>Residual neuromuscular block ( RNMB ) frequent immediate postoperative period source complication , mainly respiratory . This include recovery delay hospital discharge delay , respiratory insufficiency infection , unforeseen ICU admission , prolong ICU stay . The incidence variable due multiple factor . Age , gender , surgery , NMBA type dos , temperature , medication , etc . In several study find incidence 6-80 % . Few study focus evaluate incidence whole country , represent global anesthesia practice . In Spain incidence unknown . The investigator hypothesize number patient postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) present RNMB general anesthesia use intermediate action NMBA . The main objective know incidence RNMB Spanish hospital , mean observational cross-sectional multicenter study . Secondary objective observe possible relationship pre- intraoperative factor .</detailed_description>
