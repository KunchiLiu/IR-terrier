	<detailed_description>To improve sensitivity specificity immunoassay , develop trend low detection threshold minimize cross reaction . A new assay technology call immunomagnetic reduction ( IMR ) develop rapid on-site assay small volume sample ( i.e . le 1ml whole blood ) . The reagent solution homogeneously disperse magnetic nanoparticles , coat hydrophilic surfactant bioprobes . Under external multiple alternating-current ( ac ) magnetic field , magnetic nanoparticles oscillate multiple ac magnetic field via magnetic interaction . The reagent external multiple ac magnetic field show magnetic property , call mixed-frequency ac magnetic susceptibility χac . Magnetic nanoparticles bind bioprobes outmost shell become large clustered . The χac reagent reduce , concentration biomolecules measure quantitatively . Several paper demonstrate IMR apply assay protein , virus , chemical , nucleic acid suitable bioprobes immobilize onto magnetic nanoparticles . Rapid diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) clinical operational priority busy emergency department ( ED ) . Since ACS associate significant mortality morbidity , early correct diagnosis great importance . Chest pain frequent symptom medical emergency department distinguish patient ACS within chest pain group diagnostic challenge . Cardiac enzyme ( include CPK/CK-MB , troponins , myoglobulin ) electrocardiography ( ECG ) combination medical history physical examination present diagnostic cornerstone . Different cardiac enzyme release myocardial cell disintegration marker cell necrosis , might detect immediately chest pain ; repeat measurement suggest . Therefore novel biomarkers rise earlier , good diagnosis accuracy additional prognostic information highly need . Some publication address potential benefit combination multiple biomarker assay ( marker myocardial injury , inflammation/plaque rupture heart failure different mechanism ) could substantially increase clinical sensitivity improve early risk stratification . However , approach rather time-consuming cost-effect . In present study , rapid IMR assay multiple biomarkers propose examine performance new investigational IMR assay , comparison current commercial assay .</detailed_description>
