	<brief_summary>Background : - Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) injure blood vessel brain . Endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) help body form new blood vessel . The drug erythropoietin ( EPO ) help body make blood cell might help make blood vessel . Researchers want see EPO help people TBI . Objective : - To see whether erythropoietin increase number endothelial progenitor cell circulate blood change reactivity brain vessel . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 70 TBI 3 7 day ago still symptom . Design : - Participants screen medical history blood test . Vital sign take . - Visit 1 : - Medical history , physical exam , blood sample . - Neuropsychological test memory , attention , think . These include write spoken question , test paper computer , simple action . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan carbon dioxide . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . For part scan , participant wear breathe mask like snorkel wear nose clip . - Study drug placebo injection skin arm , leg , buttock . - Visits 2 , 3 , 4 1 week apart . - Blood sample . - Review TBI symptom drug side effect . - Study drug placebo injection skin . - Visit 5 1 week visit 4 . Visit 6 6 month participant start study . - Blood sample . - Review TBI symptom drug side effect . - Neuropsychological test . - MRI carbon dioxide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability people age 45 industrialized country 5 ; 6 . Significant number US veteran war Iraq Afghanistan return TBI7 . However , date , specific neuroprotective treatment option proven clinical efficacy 8 . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) approve FDA treat anemia comprehensive preclinical data support neuroprotective neuroregenerative efficacy follow traumatic ( TBI ) wide range acquire brain insult . Injury small medium-sized cerebral blood vessel well recognize consequence TBI . EPO increase production endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) 4 ; 9 promotes angiogenesis neovascularization TBI . EPO also promote neurogenesis improves functional recovery animal experimental stroke10-12 TBI.13 ; 14 Neovascularization couple neurogenesis , augmentation process EPO may result lessened cognitive deficit . Neovascularization EPO may prevent post-traumatic deficit cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) , measure noninvasively use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This proposal randomize , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial design obtain data effect EPO human persistent post-concussive symptom TBI . The primary objective evaluate effect 4 week administration recombinant erythropoietin number circulate endothelial progenitor cell patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI . This information guide design future definitive study . Study Population The study population include 30 male female persistent post-concussive symptom continue 7 day TBI . Participants military service member civilians present outpatient clinical management TBI post-concussive symptom Center Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine ( CNRM ) -affiliated hospital . These include Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) , Suburban Hospital ( SH ) , Washington Hospital Center ( WHC ) . Design Participants refer NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) participate hospital recruit advertisement CNRM Recruitment core receive EPO placebo . Telephone screen carry determine tentative eligibility . At baseline visit , participant screen , consent randomized 2:1 receive either EPO placebo dose 40,000 IU EPO subcutaneously ( s.c. ) ( n=20 ) weekly 4 week placebo ( n=10 ) . Each participant 6 outpatient visit ( visit 1-6 ) perform NIH CC . Placebo active drug administer s.c. base randomization visit 1-4 ; blood collect EPC assay safety laboratory measurement visit . Brain MRI neuropsychological test perform visit 1 ( administer EPO placebo ) , visit 5 ( one week final drug administration ) visit 6 ( 6 month study enrollment ) . Outcome Measures Primary outcome : 1. . Effect 4 week EPO administration number circulate EPCs patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI ( within subject comparison ) . Secondary outcome : 2. . Comparison change number circulate EPC EPO placebo group . 3. . Effect 4 week EPO administration MRI biomarkers TBI recovery ( CVR hypercapnia global regional brain volume MRI ) . 4. . Effect 4 week EPO administration plasma biomarkers angiogenesis inflammation , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , stromal-derived factor ( SDF-1 ) ; matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) . 5. . Effect 4 week placebo administration number circulate EPCs patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI . Tertiary outcome : 6. . Relationship EPC level baseline 4 week neuropsychological performance follow TBI .</detailed_description>
