	<brief_summary>Background : - The National Cancer Institute fund study much radiation U.S. veterans serve 1950s expose . Researchers want estimate much radiation veteran receive . They use two method compare . One interview veteran study military record . The take blood sample look certain type change blood cell . Being expose kind radiation know cause change blood cell . The amount change cell tell scientist much radiation receive . Objectives : - To good understand measure much radiation person receive . Eligibility : - Veterans expose radiation specific site Pacific 1954 sit 1950s . - Veterans close age first group , low level exposure radiation . - Men 25 year old exposure radiation . Design : - Participants 1 visit , home . - All participant blood drawn . This take 10 minute . - The exposed veteran interview . They answer question nuclear event experience . This take 40 minute . - For exposed veteran , researcher look military record , . They estimate much radiation veteran receive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Dose Assessment Methods Exposures Nuclear Detonation Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding potential consequence exposure nuclear detonation current national security concern . In event nuclear detonation , important priority scientific national security community able estimate exposure general population medical triage , treatment , follow-up risk projection public health purpose . The available comprehensive exposure estimate person expose nuclear detonation radiation study wartime atomic bomb survivor . There urgent need evaluate exposure assessment method population determine well work obstacle involve application . In absence study exposures nuclear detonation radiation , Atomic Veterans Epidemiologic Study ( AVES ) 1 , large ongoing study atomic veteran 115,000 atomic veteran participate aboveground nuclear weapon test 1945-1962 provide unique opportunity evaluate last biological effect radiation receive nuclear detonation . That study mean identify veteran receive high exposure well control subject minimal exposure . An overview AVES find http : //www.vbdr.org/meetings/2013/Presentations/02_Dr_Boice.pdf . We propose conduct small methodologic investigation follow objective : evaluate level agreement radiation exposure estimate generally simple inexpensive assessment strategy model-based dose reconstruction well-established long-term biologically-based dose estimation technique - quantification chromosome aberration frequency . In study , dose reconstruction would include individual interview data . The study would conduct use group U.S. veteran expose nuclear detonation radiation 1950s 1960s . While many thousand veteran still alive today participate nuclear testing-related activity , 16 identify still live estimate exposure sufficient magnitude chromosome aberration frequency assay successful . These particular veteran expose Rongerik Atoll Pacific 1954 Nevada Test Site 1951-1952 . The dose estimate also compare individual record exposure obtain radiation film-badges , available . All person study part study cohort AVES study . The primary purpose evaluate model-based dose reconstruction dose estimate base chromosome aberration frequency ass presence substantial difference ( either systematic random ) dose estimate via model-based dose reconstruction AVES . Because chromosome aberration frequency assay difficult , expensive somewhat invasive ( require blood sample ) , practical study many thousand subject AVES . Determination model-based dose estimation systematically different FISH-estimated dos substantial value AVES . To limited degree , i.e. , within constraint small sample size , study may indicative potential model-based dose estimate rely upon mass exposure take place nuclear detonation . It noteworthy collection sample data evaluate dos study take advantage one-of-a-kind situation obtain exposure-related data unique ( rapidly dwindle ) population live person expose atomic weapon detonation radiation situation repeat except wartime actual national threat situation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : EXPOSED VETERANS . Subjects investigation require receive , accord military record , wholebody radiation dose excess 0.25 Sv ensure adequate detection radiation exposure FISH method . The recorded dos crude dose estimate , often base group radiation monitoring rather individual data , however , information available , upon select study subject meet criterion . To date , 16 expose veteran meet requirement identify AVES access database NTPRP construct Dept . Defense .</criteria>
