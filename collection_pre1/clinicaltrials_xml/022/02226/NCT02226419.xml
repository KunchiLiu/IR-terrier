	<brief_summary>The investigator wish investigate fat sugar metabolism exercise without L-carnitine supplementation patient carnitine transporter deficiency ( CTD ) . Patients CTD low plasma- muscle concentration carnitine , believe lead impaired fat oxidation . Presently cure available patient , daily intake L-carnitine show limit amount symptom . Little known metabolism exercise pathophysiological mechanism causing symptom . Studying fat sugar metabolism CTD patient contribute understanding role carnitine transporter development symptom patient . Furthermore , knowledge fat sugar metabolism patient increase understanding role carnitine transporter metabolism healthy person . The investigator include 8 patient genetically verify CTD study group 10 age- sex-matched control . Subjects perform 1h cycle test , exercise moderate intensity . By measure expiration carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) consumption oxygen ( O2 ) , investigator determine total fatty acid carbohydrate oxidation cycling . At time investigator measure patient ' whole body palmitate ( fat ) glucose ( sugar ) oxidation rate use stable isotope technique . The patient group repeat cycle test 4 day without take usual L-carnitine treatment . During treatment break , patient admit continuously monitor heart rhythm disturbance , know rarely occur complication untreated CTD . Since patient defect fat metabolism , investigator expect find reduced ability burn fat , major source energy low intensity exercise . It therefore likely , CTD patient benefit adjustment daily diet , whenever perform physically . By learn metabolism different dietary substance , fat sugar , study help improve treatment term dietary recommendation CTD patient . This direct impact daily life patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat Sugar Metabolism During Exercise , With Without L-carnitine Patients With Carnitine Transporter Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>8 Patients verified CTD include - All patient perform incremental load exercise test exhaustion cycle ergometer determine maximal oxygen comsumption rate ( VO2 max ) - One-hour exercise test : Measurement total fat sugar oxidation rate exercise use stable isotope tracer . Subjects arrive laboratory 3-9 hour fast . One IV-catheter inserted cubital vein one arm another peripheral vein hand . The stable isotope tracer give cubital vein constant infusion solution : - [ U-13C ] -palmitate ( 0.0026 mg x kg-1 x min-1 , prim bolus 0.085 mg x kg-1 NaH13CO3 ) - [ 1,1,2,3,3-2H5 ] -glycerol ( 0.0049 mg x kg-1 x min-1 ) - [ 6.6-2H2 ] -glucose ( 0.0728 mg x kg-1 x min-1 ) 5 day study , subject must avoid eat food contain corn . Corn contain large amount C13 , use tracer , therefore disturb measurement . For two hour subject rest receive infusion tracer distribute body reach steady state . After rest , subject exercise cycle-ergometer exhaustion maximum 1 hour intensity correspond 60-70 % VO2max . Every minute exercise , heart rate record subject evaluate his/her degree exertion ( Rate Perceived Exertion , RPE ) Borg scale . Blood breath sample : From 20 minute exercise end exercise , blood sample draw IV-catheter hand vein ( 10-12 mL per sample ) sample expire breath collect Douglas bag ( Hans Rudolph inc. ) every ten minute . The breath transfer Vaccutainer-glas analysis 13CO2 -enrichment ( 10 mL ) . The plasma sample anayzed concentration hormone , metabolite , carnitine acyl-carnitines . Muscle biopsy : On day muscle biopsy take vastus lateralis thigh measure intramuscular concentration carnitine acylcarnitines . - Wash-out period : For 4 day patient admit telemetric cardiac monitoring pause daily oral L-carnitine treatment . - After washout period , patient repeat one-hour exercise test stable isotope tracer . Also muscle biopsy intramuscular carnitine acyl-carnitine concentration repeated- TRACERS In study use infusion stable isotope incorporate metabolite tracer whole body metabolism . We use small amount fat ( palmitate glycerol ) sugar ( glucose ) label stable isotope carbon ( 13C ) hydrogen ( 2H ) . The palmitate glycerol tracer ( 98 % enrich , Cambrigde Isotope Laboratories , Andover , MA , USA ) dissolve sterile water infuse bacterial filter human serum albumin . The glucose tracer ( 99 % enrich , Cambrigde Isotope Laboratories , Andover , MA , USA ) dissolve injected solution 0.9 % saline ( NaCl ) bacterial filter well . These tracer naturally occur food ( e.g . corn ) human body . They harmless handle give subject sterile condition .</detailed_description>
