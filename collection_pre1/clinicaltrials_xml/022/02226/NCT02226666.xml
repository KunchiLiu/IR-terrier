	<brief_title>Physiologic Assessment Following Gadoxetic Acid Gadobenate Dimeglumine Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-enhanced hepatic MRI accept method detect characterize liver lesion . Liver lesion characterization fundamental patient management , lesion meet specific image criterion hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) assume HCC without tissue confirmation . There variety gadolinium-based contrast agent use purpose . Two commonly utilized gadoxetic acid ( hepatobiliary contrast agent permit 20 minute hepatobiliary phase image ) gadobenate dimeglumine ( weak hepatobiliary contrast agent function generally extracellular contrast agent ) . A recent study group show patient receive intravenous gadoxetic acid much likely experience transient dyspnea contrast injection cause breathe rapidly arterial phase imaging , degrade image quality . In study , subjective complaint dyspnea respiratory motion artifact image score . The investigator assess patient physiologic response . The goal propose work build prior data determine whether non-invasively measurable physiologic parameter support original study . Specifically , investigator want determine whether predictable change SpO2 , pulse , respiratory periodicity , respiratory regularity correlate arterial phase image degradation patient complain dyspnea . Both contrast agent assess study FDA approve least 4 year post-marketing experience document safety efficacy . The investigator change alter clinical approach way part study .</detailed_description>
