	<brief_title>Telemonitoring Device Managing Outpatient Care Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Intensive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility home telemonitoring adult patient follow intensive induction , re-induction/salvage , consolidation chemotherapy myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) non-acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate impact telemonitoring intervention mortality , duration hospital stay , use emergency service , visit primary care physician specialist , home visit , telephone call ( `` health care resource utilization '' ) . II . To evaluate telemonitoring procedure economic term compare usual care cost-effectiveness analysis . III . To estimate impact quality life study participate . IV . To assess degree satisfaction patients/caregivers health care professional telemonitoring intervention . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( CONTROL ) : Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care completion chemotherapy . ARM II ( INTERVENTION ) : Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care Arm I use home telemonitoring device duration chemotherapy-induced cytopenia ( 3-4 week ) .</detailed_description>
