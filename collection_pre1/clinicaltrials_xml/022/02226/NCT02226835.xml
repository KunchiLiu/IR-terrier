	<brief_summary>Background : - Alzheimer disease affect brain cause memory think problem old people . Macular degeneration ( MD ) eye condition . It lead reason people age 55 United States lose central vision . Central vision important see fine detail task like read drive . A feature Alzheimer disease plaque brain . A feature age-related MD deposit retina eye . Researchers want learn disease find related . Objective : - To see whether relationship Alzheimer disease age-related macular degeneration . Eligibility : - People without Alzheimer disease enrol another study . Participants must someone help take part study . Design : - Participants screen study . They 1 visit . The test take 3 hour . - Participants answer question medical eye history . - Participants eye exam test well see . Their eye pressure measure eye movement check . - Participants get eye drop dilate pupil . Researchers take picture retina inside eye . Researchers may measure thickness retina . - Participants continue receive care regular eye doctor study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) Alzheimer disease ( AD ) neurodegenerative disease affect similar demographic patient . Beyond age common risk factor disease , important common characteristic similarity pathology finding , specifically , presence amyloid ( beta ) ( A ( beta ) ) senile plaque AD brain drusen AMD patient . As disease cause significant morbidity quickly grow age population , understand pathogenesis identification overlap pathophysiology lead well understanding disease . The objective study investigate presence AMD neurodegenerative lesion characterize retinal finding group participants well-phenotyped AD . Study Population : Up 150 participant ( 100 symptomatic , 50 control ) recruit patient already enrol participate National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) study , 09-M-0198 , Screening Evaluation Patients Signs Symptoms Alzheimer Disease . Design : This single center , cross-sectional , observational study include single eye clinic visit eye exam , visual acuity , photography optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) test . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome presence AMD retinal finding patient diagnose AD . Secondary outcome include autofluorescence imaging , spectral domain OCT visual acuity .</detailed_description>
