	<brief_summary>We hypothesize patient difficulty word recall ( naming picture ) due stroke experience great benefit word recall receive combination transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) traditional behavioral treatment . This study investigate effect time tDCS relationship behavioral treatment determine optimal protocol . Transcranial direct current stimulation involve place two electrode scalp send small electrical current excite brain cell target site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Aim 1 : Identify quantify effect a-tDCS left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) conjunction intensive behavioral treatment name non-fluent aphasia . a-tDCS ( 2mA 20 minute ) apply left DLPFC cathode right orbit . Pre post treatment behavioral measure name work memory use quantify compare difference . Hypothesis 1 : a-tDCS result improvement name accuracy , name response time , work memory ( WM ) participants non-fluent aphasia . Aim 2 : Compare effect a-tDCS applied leave DLPFC behavioral treatment behavioral treatment non-fluent aphasia . a-tDCS ( 2mA 20 minute ) apply left DLPFC cathode right orbit . Pre post treatment behavioral measure name work memory use quantify compare functional difference condition . Hypothesis 1 : a-tDCS DLPFC treatment result great improvement name accuracy , name response time WM participant non-fluent aphasia . Significance The finding propose study lay foundation large clinical trial turn significant impact individual aphasia give name deficit common symptom population . As presence name deficit negative relationship emotional well-being functional communication 26-30 , treatment improves name deficit positively influence quality life many individual . The approach take remediate naming deficit aphasia treat impaired WM system premise certain cognitive process underlie linguistic function aphasia . This approach represent departure behavioral-based naming treatment approach , reflect grow recognition WM system individual aphasia impact linguistic performance 5 , 31 . The addition a-tDCS neuromodulation tool increase cortical excitability ( upregulate ) work memory center target name novel approach . In addition , study elucidate optimal time a-tDCS order achieve beneficial outcome , yet report . These finding , along related study , shape future clinical practice guideline study adopt concurrent cognitive-linguistic approach treat linguistic deficit aphasia . Design &amp; Methodology Participants . Four individual aphasia recruit . These participant must meet follow inclusionary/exclusionary criterion : ) completion high school GED ; b ) normal corrected-to-normal vision ; c ) adequate hearing acuity 1:1 conversational exchange ; ) use English primary language ; e ) vascular lesion dominant leave hemisphere verify MRI scan within six month start study . These participant must also meet follow exclusionary criterion : ) previous history neurological- psychiatric-based illness disease , language learning disability , alcohol/substance abuse ; b ) history seizure ; c ) metal implant head ( except dental filling ) ; ) lesion leave DLPFC confirm MRI ; e ) current pregnancy . Pre-Test Behavioral Measures . Participants see 2-3 session undergo comprehensive cognitive-linguistic test prior initiation treatment . Testing take place University Minnesota ( UMN ) Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) . Behavioral test measure include WAB 32 order obtain WAB Aphasia Quotient ( WAB AQ ) , Boston Naming Test ( BNT ) 33 Apraxia Battery Adults ( ABA-2 ) 34 . The WAB AQ provide general classification aphasia subtype , score BNT provide level severity name impairment , ABA-2 performance use assess severity apraxia speech ( AoS ) . To assess integrity phonological store , participant test effect phonological similarity use auditory visual presentation 35 , 36 . To assess integrity subvocal rehearsal process , participant test effect word length auditory visual span 37 ; effect articulatory suppression recall performance 37 , 38 ; rhyme judgment 39-41 . Protocols adapt individual aphasia followed42-45 . These test use distinguish behavioral evidence deficient subvocal rehearsal process deficient phonological short-term store . Individuals range moderate moderately severe nonfluent aphasia , range moderate moderately severe anomia , range mild AoS chosen study . Baseline probe also obtain prior initiation study . Stability baseline performance , define 20 % difference score , obtain three consecutive session order establish experimental control . Post-Test Behavioral Measures . Participants also see post-treatment test follow implementation treatment protocol . Testing take place participant 's home . Post-treatment behavioral measure include BNT , ABA-2 , WM task , name treatment control item . It anticipate one session need post-treatment testing . An adverse event survey also provide assess participant 's level discomfort use tDCS . tDCS Protocol . Each participant seat comfortably chair . A swim cap place participant 's head identify cranial landmark accurate electrode placement . The area refer F3 International 10/20 system electroencephalogram electrode placement46 establish optimal location target leave DLPFC25 , 47-49 . The F3 region locate mark vertex ( midpoint leave right tragus midpoint nasion inion ) , measure head circumference . When measurement enter Beam F3 Locator Software50 , additional value provide reliably identify location F3 . Once F3 establish , two saline soak surface sponge electrode ( 352cm ) prepare place . For optimal anodal stimulation DLPFC , anode place F3 cathode place right supraorbital region23 , 24 , 47 , 48 . A current 2mA deliver 20 minute 24 multichannel transcranial current stimulator ( Starstim , Neuroelectrics Corporation ; Cambridge , MA ) . a-tDCS applied behavioral treatment design specify . Treatment Design . Two treatment condition present counter-balanced order cross-over design . The non-prime ( NONPRIME ) condition consist 40 minute name treatment , follow additional 20 minute concurrent name treatment a-tDCS . The primed ( PRIME ) condition consist presentation a-tDCS 20 minute prior name treatment , subject sits quietly comfortably chair . After 20-minute priming period , a-tDCS remove participant receive naming treatment 60 minute . Both condition present four consecutive day . Two participant receive NON-PRIME-PRIME sequence , one-month washout period two condition . Two participant receive PRIME-NON-PRIME sequence , one-month washout period two condition . Naming reaction time immediately evaluate treatment day .</detailed_description>
