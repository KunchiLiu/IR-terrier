	<brief_title>An Open Label Rollover Trial Patients Randomized Control Group Study LSH-10-001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label evaluation safety effectiveness Algisyl-LVR patient dilate cardiomyopathy either ischemic non-ischemic origin . The evaluation primary measure efficacy ( Peak VO2 ) 6 month investigator-blinded . The primary safety endpoint , blind , 30 day all-cause mortality objective assessment . The remain study endpoint evaluate effect device evaluation functional , structural , biochemical , electrocardiographic evaluation 6 12 month . Evaluation adverse event assessment also provide evidence safety profile device patient dilate cardiomyopathy . Pre-enrollment baseline patient evaluation include clinical assessment , assessment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class , blood test , transthoracic echocardiography , MRI , electrocardiogram , cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPX ) , submaximal exercise testing , quality life assessment . Blinded central evaluation perform measure cardiopulmonary exercise test cardiac imaging . *Note : The local CPX echocardiography measurement use determine patient eligibility respect peak V02 value , ejection fraction leave ventricular end diastolic dimension index body surface area ( LVEDDi ) . The core lab value assessment use statistical analysis study . Patient 's eligible study complete least 12 month follow control group lead-in study LSH-10-001 provide write informed consent participate study LSH-001 . A write informed consent enrol study LSH-11-001 require patient elect participation roll-over study . After write patient inform consent obtain verification eligibility , patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion include study Algisyl-LVR™ device ( implant ) administer surgical procedure . Patients consider part study cohort soon hospitalize receive Algisyl-LVR device . The investigator complete `` Premature Withdrawal Follow-up '' form patient 's eCRF study LSH-10-001 indicate `` Patient receive Algisyl-LVR device '' reason premature withdrawal LSH-10-001 . The acute response device implant monitor intraoperatively via continuous electrocardiographic cardiac monitoring , arterial pressure line , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) , pulmonary artery catheter . Patients receive investigational device expect remain hospitalized 5 14 day . Follow-up study divide two phase . During first phase , refer `` efficacy phase '' , repeat test patient functional cardiac structural parameter conduct follow-up visit schedule 3 month 6 month , every 6 month thereafter . Follow-up testing supplement 30 day ( post implant ) telephone contact patient . The efficacy phase trial end common closing date minimum 6 month follow-up ( i.e. , last patient enrol complete 6 month visit ) . At point data analysis perform initial study report generate . Following completion efficacy phase , long-term monitoring continue patient 's 24-month visit . This second phase refer `` extended follow-up phase '' . During phase , data collection focus long-term safety conduct 6-month interval .</detailed_description>

Patients must complete study related procedure 12 month , 18 month 24 month visit Protocol LSH10001 . Study procedure complete 12 , 18 24 month visit study LSH110001 use baseline ( screen ) qualify procedure study LSH11001 procedure perform within 60 day date AlgisylLVR implant ( screen procedure outside window must repeat ) . 2 . The patient must able willing give write informed consent 3 . The patient adult ( age ≥ 18 year ≤ 79 year ) males female 4 . The patient must stable , evidencebased therapy heart failure Evidencebased therapy heart failure define ACEinhibitor ( ACEI ) , and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) patient stable dos 1 month prior enrollment , tolerate , beta blocker ( carvedilol , metoprolol succinate , Nebivolol bisoprolol ) 3 month prior enrollment , tolerate . Recent uptitration beta blocker acceptable patient stable dose 1 month prior enrollment . Stable define 100 % increase 50 % decrease dose . Contraindications intolerance therapy document . In intolerant ACEI ARB , combination therapy hydralazine oral nitrate consider . Therapeutic equivalence ACEI substitution allow within enrollment stability timeline . Aldosterone inhibitor therapy add NYHA Class III IV symptom occur standard therapy . If aldosterone inhibitor therapy administer NYHA Class II patient , must initiate optimized prior enrollment . Eplerenone require dosage stability 1 month prior enrollment . Diuretics use necessary keep patient euvolemic . All heart failure therapeutic dosage document Case Report Forms . * Note : CRT CRTD acceptable cotherapy , place &gt; 3 month implant AlgisylLVR investigator anticipate within 6 month enrollment 5 . The patient leave ventricular ejection fraction equal le 35 % via echocardiography , cardiac catheterization , radionuclide scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( measure within last 30 day ) 6 .
