	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well copper Cu 64-tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid ( DOTA ) -trastuzumab positron emission tomography ( PET ) work predict response treatment ado-trastuzumab emtansine patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast cancer spread place body . Copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab chemotherapy drug ( trastuzumab ) attach radioactive substance . Diagnostic procedure use PET may allow scanner take picture drug travel body may help doctor identify patient may benefit treatment ado-trastuzumab emtansine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copper Cu 64-DOTA-Trastuzumab PET Predicting Response Treatment With Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine Patients With Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate uptake 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab ( copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab ) PET individual tumor subsequent tumor response ado-trastuzumab emtansine assess serial 18F-fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) ( fludeoxyglucose F 18 ) /PET-computed tomography ( CT ) . II . Compare tumor uptake 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET patient patient respond ado-trastuzumab emtansine . III . Obtain tumor tissue subsequent assessment presence putative molecular mechanism resistance ( MMRs ) ado-trastuzumab emtansine . When fund becomes available , sample use explore correlation presence MMRs assess histopathology tumor response ado-trastuzumab emtansine univariate analysis combination tumor uptake 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab measure PET/CT . OUTLINE : Patients undergo whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT . Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute immediately receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab IV undergo PET scan 24 48 hour . Patients receive ado-trastuzumab emtansine IV every 3 week complete response disease progression discretion treat oncologist . Patients undergo restaging whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT every 6 week initiation treatment disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
