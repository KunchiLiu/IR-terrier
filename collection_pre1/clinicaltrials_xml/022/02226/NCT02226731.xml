	<brief_title>Intrauterine Tamponade With Belfort-Dildy Balloon Treatment Immediate Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immediate postpartum hemorrhage ( IPPH ) among frequent cause pregnancy-related mortality USA Europe . In France , IPPH remain leading cause maternal mortality , responsible 18 % maternal death 90 % death IPPH consider avoidable . The initial treatment severe IPPH involve medical management , uterine massage , uterotonic drug oxytocin , ergometrine , prostaglandins analogue ; In France oxytocin use first line uterotonic , Sulprostone second line uterotonic . When first-line medical treatment fail , invasive therapy , include uterine compression suture , pelvic vascular ligation , arterial embolization use , individually combination . Hysterectomy ultimate measure control hemorrhage save mother 's life . Nonetheless , management severe IPPH le well standardized prevention , especially failure uterotonic drug , demonstrate heterogeneity practice country even hospital country . These invasive treatment require specific expensive technical human resource adverse effect . That , last year , intra-uterine tamponade balloon increasingly use ; indeed , new minimally invasive method use directly delivery room , initial stage second-line treatment ; could accelerate control IPPH , limit recourse surgical interventional radiology treatment , reduce quantity blood product transfuse . Intrauterine balloon tamponade thus appear potentially additional effective strategy obtain hemostasis case IPPH refractory conventional uterotonic treatment . Despite fact current literature assess efficacy limit case series before-after observational study , available evidence suggest associate drop need invasive treatment . Based evidence , intra-uterine tamponade balloon include guideline PPH treatment many country , include France , widely spread clinical practice . The clinical question arise optimal timing management PPH . It currently classically perform failure second-line uterotonic treatment possible earlier use , failure first-line uterotonic treatment , could decrease rate severe PPH . A randomize control trial therefore necessary determine optimal timing intrauterine balloon tamponade treatment PPH . . We propose multicenter , randomized open treatment trial two parallel arm . The trial conduct 21 maternity unit . Before inclusion begin , medical staff train use obstetric tamponade system use trial . For woman IPPH refractory first line uterotonic , eligibility criterion immediately verify , woman inform write informed consent obtain possible . If , woman nonetheless randomize secondarily inform consent request . The randomization list centralize generated computer program supervision Paris Centre Clinical Research Unit . Allocation study arm perform secure Internet platform ( CleanWeb ) always accessible ( 24/7 ) delivery room . The clinician include patient know allocation immediately . The management randomize woman depend arm allocate : - In Experimental arm : intravenous second line uterotonic Sulprostone infusion immediately combine intrauterine tamponade Belfort-Dildy balloon . Balloon insertion inflation follow standardize protocol . Its intrauterine position verify abdominal ultrasound . If bleeding persists cervix balloon catheter drainage port 30 minute begin Sulprostone infusion , tamponade consider failure invasive emergency procedure interventional radiology surgery arrange perform immediately removal balloon operating room . - In Control arm , woman receive Sulprostone infusion first . If bleeding persists 30 minute begin infusion , intrauterine tamponade Belfort-Dildy balloon perform . Balloon insertion inflation perform follow standardize protocol . If bleeding persists cervix balloon catheter drainage port 15 30 minute introduction balloon , tamponade consider failure invasive emergency procedure interventional radiology surgery arrange perform immediately removal balloon operating room . In arm , patient indwell urinary catheter receive antibiotic prophylaxis ( amoxicillin-clavulanic acid gentamicin ) begin Sulprostone infusion continue 48 hour . The component IPPH management ( fluid resuscitation , transfusion , resuscitation ) comply national guideline . If bleeding stop , patient transfer continuous care post-interventional monitoring unit . Monitoring conduct investigator include patient . A venous blood sample collect 2nd day postpartum measure hemoglobin hematocrit value . The data enter collect throughout trial Cleanweb software . The duration participation patient include trial inclusion postpartum visit , maximum approximately 8 week delivery . The maximum duration study treatment 24 hour patient include protocol . The total duration trial 36 month include 24 month patient inclusion : first 4 month , begin inclusion period devote training staff use balloon tamponade system compliance trial protocol 8 month follow end inclusion period use finalize data collection , clean database analyze .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The trial include woman : age 18 year old , vaginal delivery 35 42 week gestation PPH persist 15 minute injection 5 UI 10 IU oxytocin slow IV uterine massage , provide informed write consent . If condition allow consent obtain immediately ethically acceptable condition , may obtain healthcare agent , none , family member , present . In case neither healthcare agent family member present day inclusion , patient nonetheless include . She inform secondarily , consent request potential continuation research use data The trial include woman : cesarean delivery contraindication Sulprostone clinical chorioamnionitis utero fetal death medicallyindicated termination pregnancy PPH secondary cervicovaginal laceration without uterine hemorrhage , uterine rupture , placenta accreta refuse sign informed consent .</criteria>
