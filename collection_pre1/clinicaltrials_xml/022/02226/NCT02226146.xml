	<detailed_description>This open-label , proof-of-concept , single group study adult patient newly diagnose , moderate extensive BP . The study consist three period : screening period 2 week , open-label treatment period last 4 week consist IV infusion bertilimumab Days 0 14 Day 28 , safety efficacy follow-up period approximately 13 week . Patients receive concomitant oral steroid treatment follow-up period . They start 30 mg prednisone daily ( equivalent ) . The initial dose maintain least 1 week , commence Day 0 , blister formation cease , crust erosion disappear reepithelialization lesion start . The corticosteroid dose reduce 20 mg daily 5 14 day . According clinical response , follow corticosteroid dose reduction 5 mg step every 5 14 day dose 10 mg daily reach corticosteroid dose reduction 2.5 mg step every 5 14 day end study .</detailed_description>
