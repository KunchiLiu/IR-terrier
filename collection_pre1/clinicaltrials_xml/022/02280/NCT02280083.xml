	<brief_summary>This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study design compare Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection ( HengLi® ) placebo efficacy safety treatment post-stroke subject focal wrist , finger case , thumb spasticity . Approximately 180 subject enrol . The core period subject receive single treatment session intramuscular HengLi® 200U 240U ( thumb spasticity present ) placebo randomization ratio 2:1 . Research contain two part : core phase extension phase . In core phase , subject finish 6 visit ( 12 week ) initial injection . During extension phase , subject accept two follow-up visit ( 6 week ) . Outcome measure include change baseline every post injection visit measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) , Disability Assessment Scale ( DAS ) Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) . The primary efficacy endpoint change baseline week 6 wrist flexor muscle tone measure Modified Ashworth Scale . Safety parameter also measure include adverse event , vital sign ( pulse blood pressure ) clinical laboratory test ( haematology , serum chemistry urinanalysis ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection ( HengLi® ) Subjects With Post-stroke Upper Limb Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose prove efficacy treatment administration Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection ( HengLi® ) beyond placebo subject post-stroke upper limb spasticity wrist finger flexor measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . Subjects receive single treatment session intramuscular HengLi® 200U 240U ( thumb spasticity present ) placebo first enroll core phase randomly . Totally 180 subject recruit part . Each complete subject finish 8 ( visit 0 7 ) clinic visit . Subjects receive single intramuscular treatment either HengLi® placebo day 0 ( visit 0 ) . The else 7 visit week 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 18 ( visit 1 7 ) week 6 ( visit 3 ) appoint primary visit determine efficacy . The primary endpoint change baseline week 6 wrist flexor muscle tone measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . The secondary endpoint involve area curve ( AUC ) MAS wrist score change baseline , change baseline wrist/finger/thumb flexor muscle tone measure MAS , DAS GAS . The safety measure involve adverse event , clinical laboratory test pulse , blood pressure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>≥40kg weight . Subjects voluntarily sign informed consent . Subjects upper limb spasticity least 3 month post stroke present spasticity wrist finger study limb . Both wrist flexor muscle tone finger flexor muscle tone evaluation record 2 great individually measure MAS ( 0 4 ) . At least one functional disability item ( i.e. , hygiene , dress , pain , cosmesis ) evaluate 2 great DAS ( 0 3 ) . If use oral antispasticity medication , must stable least 1 month prior study enrolment . If take physical therapy occupational therapy , must stable frequency , type , intension least 1 month prior study enrolment . In opinion investigator , subject must clearly understand intent study willing able comply study instruction complete entire study . Females pregnant , nursing , plan pregnancy study period , female childbearing potential , use reliable mean contraception . Known allergy sensitivity study medication component . Infection dermatological condition injection site . Significant inflammation study limb limit joint movement . Unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , esophageal gastric varix persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History plan surgical intervention spasticity study limb . Participation another clinical study currently , within one month immediately prior enrolment . Within six month prior study receive treatment patient botulinum toxin serotype . Any medical condition may put subject increase risk exposure , include diagnose myasthenia gravis , EatonLambert syndrome , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , disorder might interfere neuromuscular function . History plan treatment spasticity phenol alcohol block study limb . Current treatment spasticity intrathecal baclofen . QTc criterion : ( either QTcb QTcf , machine manual overread , male female ) ; include follow detail appropriate : QTc≥450 millisecond ( msec ) or≥480msec subject Bundle Branch Blockvalues base either single electrocardiogram ( ECG ) value triplicate ECG average QTc value obtain brief recording period . Liver function test : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≥2xULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ＞1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Concurrent use aminoglycoside antibiotic agent might interfere neuromuscular function . Presence clinically unstable severe cardiovascular , renal respiratory disease . Profound atrophy muscle inject ( investigator opinion ) . Planned anticipated initiation new antispasticity medication clinical study . History ( within 3 month qualification ) plan ( study period ) casting study limb . patient severe cognitive impairment neurological disease affect implementation evaluation test , drugdependent patient .
