	<brief_summary>The background clinical trial overall aim World Health Organization ( WHO ) obtain eradication polio world . As part overall plan , inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) poliovirus type 1 , 2 3 , affordable price , need become available low resource third World country . The primary objective phase I/II clinical trial provide proof concept ( POC ) 10 time dose reduction IPV SSI decrease immunogenicity clinically significantly compare full dose IPV SSI , demonstrate non-inferiority booster effect 3 Al ( OH ) 3 adjuvated reduce dose IPV formulation ( 1/3 IPV-Al SSI , 1/5 IPV-Al SSI 1/10 IPV-Al SSI ) compare non-adjuvated full dose IPV SSI . A total 240 healthy adolescent history IPV SSI vaccination 3 , 5 , 12 month 5 year age accord Danish vaccination program include trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial phase I/II , parallel- multi-group , randomise , control , multi-centre , non-inferiority trial investigate safety immunogenicity 4 IPV vaccine , give booster vaccination adolescent complete primary infant vaccination pre-school booster vaccination IPV Denmark . At Visit 1 ( Screening vaccination visit ) , write informed consent obtain subject 's eligibility assess accord pre-specified in-/exclusion criterion , include measurement oral temperature . If subject include , pre-vaccination blood sample take polio antibody determination , subject randomly allocate one 4 group vaccinate . The subject observe ½ hour IMP injection immediate adverse event observe record . A diary , thermometer ruler hand subject measure daily injection site reaction temperature first 3 day ( 72 hour ) record adverse event follow-up visit . At Visit 2 ( Follow-up visit ) , 28-35 day later , post-vaccination blood sample take , diary collect , adverse event concomitant medication record eCRF . The trial conduct two part . In first part , 50 % subject randomise allocation weight 4:4:1:1 IPV SSI , 1/3 IPV-Al SSI , 1/5 IPV-Al SSI 1/10 IPV-Al SSI , respectively . In second part , correspond allocation weight 1:1:4:4 remain 50 % subject . After inclusion 50 % subject , interim immunogenicity analysis plan . While interim analysis 50 % complete subject perform , trial continue recruit randomise remain 50 % subject .</detailed_description>
