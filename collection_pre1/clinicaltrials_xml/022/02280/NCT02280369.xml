	<brief_summary>The automate inflatable abdominal binder investigational device treatment orthostatic hypotension ( low blood pressure stand ) autonomic failure patient . The purpose study evaluate performance binder detect body posture different type human motion pattern activity daily live , develop new ( good ) way detect upright posture . In particular , investigator want determine activity daily live , normally encountered patient ( lie , sit , stand , walk , climb step ) , interfere detection upright posture use trigger device . Studies conduct healthy subject main purpose study evaluate posture detection rather treat orthostatic hypotension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posture Detection Automated Abdominal Binder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective study develop validate algorithm need detect upright posture waist 3-axis accelerometer . A Secondary Objective determine performance reliability posture detection thigh waist accelerometer expose activity daily live ( stand , walk , climb stair ) . We test primary secondary objective normal subject use single study design . Studies objectives conduct simultaneously subject single study day . Normal subject wear device waist accelerometer incorporate within controller box . Subjects instrument abdominal belt controller box contain waist accelerometer sensor . The external accelerometer sensor fix Velcro around thigh . In addition , subject wear two commercially available accelerometer sensor : 1 ) ActivPal thigh leg , 2 ) external accelerometer attach back belt level waist . The ActivPal detect upright posture distinguish supine sit . The sensor place back less affected belly size case obese subject . Both sensor use reference comparison . We record accelerometer signal different body position activity . The activity include lie , sit , get stand still , walk , climb step one minute total 15-20 minute per group activity . Participants perform 3 group activity . The order activity within group randomize . We might also ask perform ~3 small jump synchronize sensor begin , middle end set activity .</detailed_description>
