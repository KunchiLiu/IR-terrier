	<brief_title>Effect Low Dose Aspirin Birthweight Twins : The GAP Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twin pregnancy represent approximately 3 % birth associate increased risk complication preeclampsia , fetal growth restriction preterm birth . All complication commonly associate impaired placental function low birth weight . Most prophylactic measure test year fail prevent adverse outcome twin pregnancy . Since administration low-dose aspirin improve placental function adverse outcomes high-risk pregnancy , mainly woman prior adverse outcome , suggest similar benefit could see twin . We expect administration low-dose aspirin start first-trimester twin pregnancy could lead improvement placental function , reduction adverse perinatal outcome therefore improvement birthweight .</detailed_description>
