	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) develop test effectiveness home-based intervention dual-task performance old adult ; ( 2 ) determine generalizability four training ( i.e . single-task motor training , single-task cognitive training , dual-task motor-cognitive training , dual-task cognitive-cognitive training ) novel task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Evaluation Home-Based Dual-Task Training Program Improve Balance Performance Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although , dual-task motor-cognitive training proven effective improve dual-task balance performance traditional single-task motor training , poor evidence training-related transfer novel dual task show . Additionally , another important impediment development intervention improve dual-task balance performance previous study largely focus training laboratory , clinical setting , often one-on-one supervision therapist research assistant . Even though home-based approach pragmatic , desirable , encourage accessibility , study do examine efficacy home-based dual-task training . Therefore , study aim address gaps literature conduct home-based program design improve dual-task performance broad transfer-of-training effect old adult . Participants randomly assign one four group ( i.e . single-task motor training , single-task cognitive training , dual-task motor-cognitive training , dual-task cognitive-cognitive training ) .</detailed_description>
