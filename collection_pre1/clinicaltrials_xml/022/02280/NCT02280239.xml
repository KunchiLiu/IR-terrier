	<brief_summary>The intensive care unit ( ICU ) team need know effect acetaminophen critically ill patient . Acetaminophen well know Tylenol . It drug give reduce fever . Most research look safe effective drug , do healthy people . Those study tell u safe work well bring fever . This may true ICU patient . Some research find acetaminophen good reduce fever expect ICU . Fever help fight infection may help patient get well , also stressful . When fever , need oxygen , heart beat faster . If fever brain injury , less likely make full recovery . In patient brain injury , weak heart trouble breathe treat fever . If predict well acetaminophen reduce fever , decide drug enough , treatment also need . If problem brain , heart , lung , safe treat fever . When give drug treat fever , body cool sweat , bring hot blood skin 's surface . These change affect healthy people . Research suggest ICU patient may risk sudden drop blood pressure . Our study answer 2 question : 1 ) When acetaminophen give treat fever ICU patient , likely drop blood pressure ? 2 ) How much acetaminophen reduce fever ICU patient ? We study ICU patient fever safely get , get drug . This information help u decide treat fever ICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In ICU , fever commonly treat 650 mg acetaminophen every 4 hour hop reduce fever burden , thereby also reduce metabolic demand . Acetaminophen think safe effective antipyretic . This assumption test critically ill despite widespread use . Observational study report critically ill patient experience hypotension , sometimes severe enough require treatment ; study indicate acetaminophen may effective reduce fever burden critically ill . OBJECTIVES : - To see 650mg acetaminophen , give febrile critically ill patient affect blood pressure ; compare incidence hypotension severe enough require treatment way fluid bolus ( 500cc great ) increase vasoactive drug ( increase norepinephrine 5mcg great ) ; assess change mean arterial pressure systolic blood pressure . - To quantify degree fever suppression achieve 650mg acetaminophen febrile critically ill population . RESEARCH PROPOSAL : Patients admit Vancouver Hospital 's ICU eligible study new fever meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Study participant randomly assign one 2 study arm , control group 650mg group . Study participant control group receive 2 capsule placebo 650mg group receive 2 capsule 325mg acetaminophen . Data ( continuous measure temperature , heart rate blood pressure ) collect time study drug administration 6 hour post . All patient , health care worker , researcher blind arm patient enrol end study . The incidence fluid bolus administration , increase vasoactive drug use , record compare . We also compare blood pressure data , fever burden 2 group . INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA To include subject must admit ICU ; arterial line standard care ; least 2 hour temperature great 38.3°C ; within 24 hour fever onset ICU admission ; hemodynamically stable , received drug know antipyretic effect least 6 hour prior initiate study . Patients exclude acute brain injury , liver dysfunction , cardiac dysfunction , require great 50 % fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO ) ; mechanical ventilation permit , extracorporeal blood treatment ( dialysis , plasmapheresis , etc . ) , injury 20 % skin ( i.e . burn patient ) , responsible physician oppose enrolment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Generally consider study one must critically ill , febrile , safely either receive acetaminophen acetaminophen withheld . Also one must condition would alter normal drug absorption normal thermoregulation . Specifically eligibility criterion : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Adult patient ( &gt; 18 year ) admit Intensive Care Unit Vancouver Hospital core temperature &gt; 38.3 °C 2 consecutive hour , longer 48 hours* Continuous arterial pressure monitor place time intervention data collection Patients may participate study To remain ICU entire study period ( 2 hour prior drug administration 4 hour post drug administration ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Significant liver dysfunction Acute neurological injury Seizure disorder Cardiomyopathy , elevate cardiac enzyme indicative acute cardiac injury , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change indicative cardiac ischemia ( i.e. , ST segment elevation/depression ) Hemodynamic instability ( require fluid bolus , change/initiation vasopressor . Patients receive steady dos vasopressor support may include ) Severe hypoxemia , ( fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) requirement 60 % maintain hemoglobin oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) &gt; 90 % partial pressure oxygen blood ( PaO2 ) &gt; 70 ) Temperature &gt; 40.0 °C Receiving external cooling Haemodialysis , plasma exchange , treatment blood take body process Acute thermal injury skin ( i.e. , burn ) Gut malabsorption ( i.e. , receive &lt; 40 % required calorie enterally ) Receiving medication know antipyretic effect ( acetaminophen , ibuprofen , steroid , etc . ) Physician oppose enrolment study</criteria>
