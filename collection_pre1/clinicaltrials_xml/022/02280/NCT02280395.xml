	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Double-Blind , Randomized , Controlled Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy RUT058-60</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-surgical site infection account approximately 20 % total healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) , make surgical site infection common HAI US hospital . Despite routine use prophylactic systemic antibiotic improvement surgical technique , surgical site infection continue associate significant morbidity , reduction quality life overall cost follow abdominal surgery . Ruthigen conduct Phase I/II clinical study evaluate safety potential efficacy RUT058-60 prevent surgical deep incisional organ space infection subject undergoing abdominal surgery adjunctive therapy prophylactic systemic antibiotic .</detailed_description>
