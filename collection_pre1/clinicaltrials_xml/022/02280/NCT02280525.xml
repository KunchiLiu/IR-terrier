	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose immune cell call natural killer ( NK ) cell give chemotherapy patient CLL . Researchers want learn add NK cell effective treat disease . The safety also study . NK cell may kill cancer cell remain body last chemotherapy treatment . The NK cell separate umbilical cord blood . The device use laboratory separate NK cell call CliniMACS . These separate NK cell grown lab increase number NK cell give vein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central Venous Catheter : The chemotherapy , drug study , NK cell give vein central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A CVC sterile flexible tube needle place large vein local anesthesia . Blood sample also draw CVC . The CVC remain body treatment . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . NK Cell Dose Levels : You assign dose level NK cell base join study . Up 5 dose level NK cell test . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose NK cell find . If enough NK cell produce laboratory assign dose level , still receive NK cell produce . If infuse low number NK cell originally plan , CLL may respond . Researchers know number NK cell need response . Chemotherapy NK Cell infusion : The day receive NK cell call minus day . The day receive NK cell call Day 0 . The day receive NK cell call plus day . You receive 1 2 study drug plan . Your doctor decide plan receive . You receive 1 2 option explain . Option # 1 : On Day -2 Day +14 , take lenalidomide mouth day time day . If able , take aspirin another drug instruct doctor day help prevent blood clot . You ask complete study drug diary bring study visit . The study staff tell . On Day -5 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . If B-cell cancer , receive rituximab vein 3-6 hour . Rituximab fludarabine give treat cancer lower immune system order low risk body reject NK cell . Cyclophosphamide give low immune system order low risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD -- transplant immune tissue , cord blood NK cell , attack tissue recipient 's body ) . On Day -4 -3 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . On Days -2 -1 , rest . On Day 0 , receive NK cell vein . Option # 2 : On Day -2 Day +14 , take lenalidomide mouth day time day . If able , take aspirin another drug instruct doctor day help prevent blood clot . You ask complete study drug diary bring study visit . The study staff tell . On Day -6 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . Fludarabine give treat cancer lower immune system order low risk body reject NK cell . On Day -5 , -4 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . Cyclophosphamide give low immune system order low risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD -- transplant immune tissue , cord blood NK cell , attack tissue recipient 's body ) . On Day -3 -2 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . Fludarabine give treat cancer lower immune system order low risk body reject NK cell . On Day -1 , rest . On Day 0 , receive NK cell vein . Study Visits : Within 7 day start chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Within 2 day 1 week , 2 week , 3 week , 1 month , 2 month , 3 month , 4 month NK cell infusion , follow test procedure perform : Â°Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test , test measure level certain protein , learn body 's immune system respond NK cell infusion , check level NK cell . About 1 week , 3 week , 1 month , 4 month NK cell infusion , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Pregnancy Tests : If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pregnancy test within 10-14 day 24 hour prescribe lenalidomide , Day +21 , 2 month NK cell infusion , 4 week therapy stop . To continue study , must pregnant . If possible , blood need pregnancy test collect blood draw additional needle stick need . Length Study : You study 1 year . You may take study early disease get bad , unable receive NK cell infusion , intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction , doctor think best interest , study stop , choose leave study early . You talk study doctor want leave study early . If take study early , still may need return routine post-transplant follow-up visit , doctor decides need . If think drop study , please tell study doctor . The doctor tell effect stop treatment . You doctor talk follow-up care test would help . If leave study , test result information remove study record . This investigational study . Rituximab , fludarabine , cyclophosphamide FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment type cancer . The use lenalidomide treatment CLL investigational . The use NK cell investigational . The NK cell process FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 44 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
