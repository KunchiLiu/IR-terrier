	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine delay dose recombinant human papillomavirus ( HPV ) quadrivalent ( Types 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ) vaccine 9-18 year old girl elicit equivalent immune response ( geometric mean titer HPV 6,11,16 , 18 measure one month receipt 3rd dose HPV vaccine ) compare vaccine deliver accord recommend dosing schedule . This prospective observational study healthy 9-18 year old female patient receive either second third dose HPV vaccine part well child care . Immune responses HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 18 measure 1 month third dose HPV vaccine purpose compare immune response HPV vaccine administer naturally occur longer dose interval immune response HPV vaccine administer routinely recommend . In addition , girl receive 3rd dose HPV vaccine well concomitantly administer vaccine injection randomize receive either HPV vaccine first concomitantly administer vaccine first . Pain follow vaccination assess arm use Faces Pain Scale - Revised . Please note : This record refer observational portion study .
