	<brief_summary>In Taiwan , 75.92 % elderlies 65 year old suffer chronic disease major disease , especially circulatory system . Thus , dramatic hemodynamic change often observed surgery population . Due osteoporosis high-prevalence morbidity , trauma fracture quite common . These elderly vulnerable complication , poor prognosis decompensated organ function . The investigator would like observe perfusion different tissue intra-operatively , find correlation surgical outcome . There many non-invasive hemodynamic monitor nowadays . In study , investigator use noninvasive cardiac output measurement ( NICOM ) , non-invasive transcutaneous near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) observe hemodynamic change tissue perfusion . After surgery , duration ICU record . A questionnaire , SF-36 , mail patient 2 month surgery measure psychometric status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-op Monitoring With NIRS NICOM , Surgical Outcome Elderly Patients With Fractures Lower Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging associate progressive loss functional reserve organ system . For people , physiologic compensation age-related change adequate . However , easy decompensate stressful circumstance , surgery illness . Under specific physiologic phenomenon , geriatric anesthesia acquire intensive monitoring . In Taiwan , 75.92 % elderlies 65 year old suffer chronic disease major disease , especially circulatory system . Thus , dramatic hemodynamic change often observed surgery population . For elderly fracture vulnerable complication , poor prognosis decompensated organ function . In daily practice , surgery fracture low extremity perform either general anesthesia regional anesthesia , spinal anesthesia epidural anesthesia , nerve block . The anesthetic method determine patient 's condition . EKG , arterial catheter , pulse oximeter usually basic intra-operative monitoring . However , tool unable inform u real-time cardiac output exact status tissue perfusion . Nowadays , many non-invasive instrument able estimate detail hemodynamic parameter , crucial anesthesia.1 But instrument widely use daily practice . We need research support beneficial role non-invasive monitor high-risk patient surgery . Due hemodynamic feature elderly , use conventional measurement EKG , arterial blood pressure pulse oximeter . To measure perfusion low extremity , use relative new tool , non-invasive transcutaneous near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) .2,3 NIRS use cerebral oximetry measure tissue perfusion cerebral cortex . It use reflectance oximetry measure oxygen saturation tissue underneath sensor.1 Recently , NIRS prove continuously monitor tissue oxygenation saturation ( StO2 ) continuously , also predict patient 's poor prognosis.3,4 To measure cardiac output intra-operatively , use non-invasive cardiac output monitor ( NICOMÂ® , Cheetah ) . Bioreactance technique allow measurement hemodynamic change via four electrode place thorax . The electrical current cross thorax make `` signal phase shift '' , related change volume thoracic aorta . Thus , volume change thoracic aorta able estimate stroke volume.1,5 Postoperative prognosis adjust recovery ambulation , duration ICU stay , morbidity mortality , questionnaire ( SF-36 ) quality life .</detailed_description>
