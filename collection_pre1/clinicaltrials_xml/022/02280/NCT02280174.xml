	<brief_summary>Overproduction intestinally derive triglyceride-rich lipoprotein ( TRLs ) ( chylomicron ) recently describe type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , know hepaticTRL ( very-low-density lipoprotein ) production . There interest identifying therapy would favourably influence postprandial concentration lipid T2DM . linagliptin potent selective inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-IV ) , show reduce fast postprandial glucose level patient type 2 diabetes mainly incretin hormone-mediated improvement islet function . Although clinical study date indicate fast lipid level minimally affect DPP-IV inhibitor treatment , animal study suggest DPP-IV inhibition reduce intestinal triglyceride ( TG ) absorption apolipoprotein ( apo ) production increase chylomicron catabolism . Interestingly , recent study support hypothesis show vildagliptin therapy able reduce postprandial intestinal TRL particles patient type 2 diabetes . Recently , report sitagliptin treatment significantly reduce plasma apoB-48 TG concentration postprandial state . The action DPP-IV inhibitor may explain insulin secretion action glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) metabolism TRL . Therefore , present study design examine effect linagliptin treatment ( LT ) v standard treatment ( ST ) metabolism TRL apoB-48 patient type 2 diabetes 12 weeks-period . The investigator study patient three different moment define : Time 0 ( 2 week LT ST , Time 1 ( 4 week LT ST ) , Time 2 ( 12 week LT ST ) . With area curve ( AUCs ) apoB48 postprandial condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes patient HbA1c 7 10 % Patients must receive maximum tolerate dose metformin least 3 month randomization . Patients randomise receive linagliptin standard therapy . A total seven study visit schedule : screening , week -4 , -2 , 0 , 4 , 6 , 12 24 week follow-up . During visit , endocrinologist make physical metabolic assessment . Safety tolerability data collect screen throughout study , include incidence serious non serious adverse event ( AEs ) linagliptin arm standard arm . Clinical laboratory data , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram parameter visit , collect . The causal relationship study drug AEs evaluate investigator site . All drug-related AEs occur study follow relieve judged longer clinically significant . Changes body weight baseline week 12 also assess . Hypoglycaemic event intensity define symptom hypoglycemia accompany fingerstick glucose value ≤ 50 mg/dl . The investigator study patient three different moment define : Time 0 ( 2 week LT ST ) , Time 1 ( 4 week LT ST ) , Time 2 ( 12 week LT ST ) . T1 show direct effect ( independent metabolic change ) T2 show indirect effect ( depend metabolic change ) . In phase , follow overnight fast , intravenous catheter insert superficial vein forearm blood sampling . After overnight fast , subject admit research unit 24-h period receive un isocaloric ( 900 kcal ) , mixed meal ( 75 g carbohydrate , 50 g fat ( 60 % saturate ) , 35 g protein ) , time point 7.00 a.m. ( breakfast ) . Blood sample draw 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , meal . The area curve ( AUC ) incremental AUC ( IAUC ) postprandial variable calculate phase . In morning phase study : basal ( T0 ) incretin condition ( T1 T2 ) , subject undergo hyperglycaemic clamp hyperinsulinaemic clamp , successively . The insulin secretion rate insulin sensitivity index measure last 30 minute clamp , respectively two arm study .</detailed_description>
