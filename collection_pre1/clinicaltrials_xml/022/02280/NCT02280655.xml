	<brief_summary>Transfusion red blood cell often use critically ill patient low red blood cell count prevent disease progression death . Recent study suggest use `` age '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cell associated bad clinical outcome . There evidence red blood cell work cell line blood vessel produce variety substance normally cause artery relax increase blood supply . Two substance call nitric oxide ( NO ) endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor ( EDHF ) . The investigator try determine nature substance human being transfuse `` age '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cell . The purpose study test effect transfuse `` age '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cell volunteer traditional cardiovascular risk factor ( high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol , tobacco use ) 1 ) degree relaxation arteries subsequent change blood flow , 2 ) blood level oxidant molecule , 3 ) inflammation , 4 ) stem cell .

	<brief_title>Adverse Effects Red Blood Cell Transfusions : A Unifying Hypothesis ( Aim 3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transfusion red blood cell ( RBCs ) often effective prevent morbidity mortality anemic patient . In contrast , recent study indicate RBC component may functional defect ( `` RBC storage lesion '' ) actually cause morbidity mortality transfuse . For example , patient transfuse RBCs store &gt; 14 day statistically bad outcome receive `` fresher '' RBC unit . In addition age store RBCs , volume transfuse may important . The Transfusion Requirements Critical Care ( TRICC ) study show specific patient whose transfusion limit restrictive trigger ( RBCs transfusion hemoglobin [ Hb ] &lt; 7 g/dL ) significantly well outcome transfused liberal trigger ( [ Hb ] &lt; 10 g/dL Hb ) . This find particularly difficult understand since conventional wisdom suggest elevate [ Hb ] beneficial support increase oxygen ( O2 ) delivery . Recipient-specific factor may also contribute occurrence adverse event . Unfortunately , event difficult investigate exist `` statistical occurrence '' increase morbidity mortality large data set . There currently clinical laboratory method detect study individual patient . The microcirculation compose continuum small vessel include small arteriole , capillary , post-capillary venule . The microcirculation represent actively-adjusting vascular circuit match blood flow ( O2 delivery ) local tissue oxygen demand . While physiologic mechanism match O2 delivery local requirement incompletely understood , endothelium-derived nitric oxide ( NO ) clearly play important role . Interestingly , recent work reveal addition transport O2 carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , RBC also control local NO concentration thus may also play surprisingly important role regulating blood flow microcirculation . Herein , investigator bring together previously unconnected data propose unifying hypothesis , center insufficient NO bioavailability ( INOBA ) , explain increased morbidity mortality observe patient follow RBC transfusion . In model , variable associate RBC unit ( storage time ; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate ( 2,3-DPG ) concentration ) transfusion recipient ( endothelial dysfunction ; hematocrit [ Hct ] ) collectively lead change NO level vascular bed . Under certain circumstance , variable `` align '' NO concentration markedly reduce , lead vasoconstriction , decrease local blood flow insufficient O2 delivery end organ . Under circumstance , likelihood morbidity mortality escalate . The INOBA hypothesis attractive explanatory power lead number readily testable prediction , investigate determine effect transfuse RBCs patient endothelial dysfunction due cardiovascular disease . A non-invasive ultrasound assay use test whether patient cardiovascular disease endothelial dysfunction ( intrinsic defect NO synthesis ) susceptible adverse effect stored/processed RBCs ( impaired NO bioavailability ) fresh RBC unit . Vasodilation tissue oxygenation response transfusion monitor , Framingham risk score cardiovascular disease biomarkers test potential predictive factor identify patient risk adverse effect RBC transfusion .</detailed_description>
