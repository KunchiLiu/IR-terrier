Studying sample blood saliva patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn inherit genetic mutation affect cancer predisposition ( inherited increase risk develop cancer ) , impact treatment response , role cancer development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Germ-Line Mutations Blood Saliva Samples From Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect germ-line deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) nucleic acid cancer patient investigate association identify new germ-line mutation impact cancer predisposition . II . To investigate role germ-line mutation predict cancer outcome response therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect identify variant tumor micro-ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) , protein gene expression . II . To study expression DNA , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) protein blood cancer patient without variant interest discover correlation level presence cancer and/or response therapy patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood saliva sample 1-3 time discretion investigator germ-line mutation analysis . After completion study , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
