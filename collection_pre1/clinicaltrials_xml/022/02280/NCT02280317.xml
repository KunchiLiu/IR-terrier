	<criteria>The study enrol patient locally advance metastatic prostate cancer . The MTD/MAD may also evaluate patient advance tumour type standard effective therapy available rationale use VAL201 exist . The average timeframe 13 week per subject outcome measure composite average group . Inclusion criterion : Specific Inclusion Criteria Patients Prostate Cancer Patients incurable , locally advanced metastatic prostate cancer policy intermittent hormone therapy decide . Who specific clinical parameter . Specific Inclusion Criteria Patients Other Advanced Solid Tumours Patients histologically and/or cytologically confirm advanced solid tumour standard effective therapy available rationale use VAL201 exists . Patients incurable , locally advanced metastatic prostate cancer policy intermittent hormone therapy decide . These patient must also follow : 1 .
