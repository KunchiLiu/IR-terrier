	<brief_summary>This study do compare blood flow measurement obtain SPECT PET image scan . Measurements myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) myocardial flow reserve ( MFR ) analyze PET scan . These measurement give doctor precise information diagnose heart problem . SPECT scan , new camera technology computer software , potential also give additional information . The study investigate well blood flow measurement SPECT compare PET .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Absolute myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) myocardial flow reserve ( MFR ) calculate measurement obtain use positron emission tomography ( PET ) nuclear imaging , myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) stress test , due advance capability PET camera technology . These calculation provide diagnostic prognostic information patient . Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) nuclear image widely do due availability lower cost , past able provide additional information need perform MBF MFR calculation . SPECT camera develop use , well software camera show measurement obtain SPECT . The goal study compare SPECT PET measurement MBF MFR determine reproducibility SPECT MFR measurement . The study do 3 Phases , recruitment do 3 year . Phase 1 2 do first 2 year , Phase 3 plan follow Phases 1 2 , 3rd year recruitment . Phase 1 : patient coronary artery disease , come University Ottawa Heart Institute ( UOHI ) MPI stress test PET SPECT MPI comparison measurement MBF MFR . The PET scan do clinical , reportable test . Phase 2 : patient coronary artery disease , come UOHI SPECT MPI test SPECT repeat see reproducible measurement . Phase 3 : normal , healthy volunteer PET SPECT scan comparison measurement MBF MFR . No change patient care do Phases 1 2 . Phase 1 Phase 2 participant 1 research scan Phase 3 participant 2 research scan . Rubidium ( Rb-82 ) Elution System Performance Data collect elution pump system , use deliver Rb-82 isotope , support system performance documentation Health Canada Authorization .</detailed_description>
