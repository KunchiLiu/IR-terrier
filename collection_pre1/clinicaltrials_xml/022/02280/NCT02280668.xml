	<brief_title>Investigating Muscle Repair Response Icing Therapy Post Eccentric Muscle Damage Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective determine whether injured muscle subject ice eccentrically damaging exercise recover strength quicker and/or less muscle soreness receive ice treatment damage exercise difference effectiveness two ice protocol exist . Baseline measure peak torque dominant arm 's elbow flexor muscle measure concentric isometric contraction prior participant undergo eccentric muscle damage exercise . Participants randomly assign 3 different experimental group approximately 15 participant . The first group begin `` Icing Protocol 1 '' time 0 ( close ) . The second group begin `` Icing Protocol 2 '' six hour initial eccentric muscle damage exercise . The remain group receive ice treatment ; control group . Participants bring back lab specific post-exercise time ( 0h , 24h , 48h , 96h , 7 day ) complete peak torque measure baseline measure prior eccentric muscle damage . Measures delay onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) also take baseline schedule follow time participant .</detailed_description>
