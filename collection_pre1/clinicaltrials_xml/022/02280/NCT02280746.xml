	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) neurodevelopmental lifelong disorder , significantly impair quality life patient family . The symptom think result interaction genetics environment . Treatment multidisciplinary , base behavioral therapy , education , sometimes require specialized care ( i.e . genetics ) pharmacotherapy . The lack consensus etiology ASD direct researcher define condition combination symptom , patient 's history data , impact co-morbidities ( include gastrointestinal disorder ) , effectiveness various management therapy . The use complementary alternative method ( CAM ) treatment common include especially elimination diet , intend minimize symptom . The basis potentially beneficial impact dietary intervention report connection correlation congenital metabolic disorder ( phenylketonuria ) patient ASD improvement overt symptoms patient schizophrenia Excessive activity peptide derive metabolism gluten casein individual ASD think result impaired neurotransmission brain . The increased permeability intestinal barrier , result inflammatory response ( theory `` leaky gut '' ) ASD patient , simultaneously promote excessive absorption compound . Another hypothesis assume effectiveness elimination diet child ASD , suggest allergic background neuropsychiatric symptom . Additionally emphasized lack ability communicate symptom atypical clinical manifestation ( i.e . neuropsychiatric symptom like hyperactivity , sleep disorder ) child ASD make diagnosis gastrointestinal symptom , allergy symptom particularly difficult . Moreover pain discomfort may increase risk behavioral symptom . Review literature concern effectiveness gluten-free casein-free diet ( GFCFD ) individual ASD reveals possible bias available study lack definite conclusion . Among 35 identified study two randomize control trial analyze . The data/information report effectiveness intervention behavioral symptom [ mean difference ( MD-mean difference ) -5.60 , 95 % CI -9.02 -2.18 , p = 0.001 ] Knivsberg 's study , reliable study limitation . Whiteley et al summarized 2012 positive effect GFCFD various symptom ASD patient . However influence GFCFD ASD child define mostly suggestive methodological limitation . The main bias include : small sample size , unclear process randomization allocation , use different ASD assessment tool , short trial duration , lack evaluation patient ' compliance intervention , limitation . The theory excessive activity exogenous opioids report specific allergy ( gluten casein ) suggest connection celiac disease ( CD ) subject ASD thus provide rationale determine effect gluten gastrointestinal symptom consequently potential behavioral change group patient .</detailed_description>
