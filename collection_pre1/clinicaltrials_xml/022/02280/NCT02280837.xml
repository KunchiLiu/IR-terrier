	<brief_summary>In study , investigator hypothesize significant proportion patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) reduce capacity glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion , detectable blunt response plasma active GLP-1 level oral glucose load reduce GLP-1 secretory function associate increased severity coronary artery stenosis classic risk factor CAD . To test hypothesis , investigator analyze correlation GLP-1 secretory capacity severity coronary artery stenosis determine Gensini Score ( GS ) , establish score system coronary artery stenosis . Additionally , investigator analyze relationship level `` total '' GLP-1 severity coronary artery stenosis determine different active GLP-1 - coronary stenosis relationship .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently , investigator find significant proportion subject general population show attenuate secretion active GLP-1 response oral glucose load insufficient secretion GLP-1 independently associate elevation blood pressure ( BP ) ( Yoshihara et al . PLoS One 2013 ; 8 : e67578 ) . In study , also find amount GLP-1 secrete glucose loading correlate conventional serum lipid parameter ( i.e. , triglyceride , LDL-cholesterol HDL-cholesterol ) plasma insulin level . These finding suggest insufficiency GLP-1 secretion may promote atherosclerosis formation coronary plaque . Furthermore , lack correlation response active GLP-1 secretion serum lipid plasma insulin indicate insufficient secretion active GLP-1 may hide risk factor atherosclerotic vascular disease . Based result previous study , investigator design present study . The present study single-centered ( Sapporo Medical University Hospital ) , observational study enrol patient admit institute coronary angiogram . Written inform consent obtain patient admission . Patients receive demographic measurement , blood sample routine serum biochemistry detail analysis serum lipid ( apolipoproteins , remnant-like lipoprotein particle oxidized-LDL-cholesterol ) overnight fast oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . In OGTT , blood sample assay glucose , insulin , active GLP-1 total GLP-1 , 30 min , 60 min , 120 min oral 75 g-glucose loading . Capacity GLP-1 secretion determine area curve plasma GLP-1 level ( AUC-GLP-1 ) . All study subject undergo coronary angiogram severity coronary artery stenosis quantify Gensini score ( GS ) . Relationship GS , AUC-active-GLP-1 AUC-total-GLP-1 , blood pressure , serum lipid parameter , index insulin resistance ( homeostasis model assessment index insulin resistance Matsuda-Defronzo index ) examine use univariate multivariate regression analyse determine whether AUC-active-GLP-1 AUC-total-GLP-1 independent determinant coronary artery stenosis . This study conduct one project BOREAS registry , non-interventional , multicenter registry cardiovascular and/or renal disease conduct institute affiliated hospital . The time frame outcome measure assess : Informed consent Hospital day 1 , Demographic examination blood urine test Hospital day 1 day 2 , OGTT Hospital day 2 day 3 , Coronary angiogram score coronary stenosis Hospital day 3 later day within 14 day admission ( patient could undergo angiogram within 14 day admission incidental cause exclude ) , Acquisition data necessary analysis Day 9-17 ( Data set patient , include remnant-like protein particle , ApoA1 , ApoB , ApoE , mostly complete within approximately 9-17 day admission . Samples determination GLP-1 store -80 C assay ) .</detailed_description>
