	<brief_summary>Peripheral nerve block well studied literature generally good result control post operative pain follow orthopaedic surgery . Regional anesthesia many benefit . It provide excellent intraoperative anesthesia muscle relaxation well analgesia continue post-operative period . These regional block also effective control pain immediate post-operative period . However , block wear , patient begin experience increase pain . Compared patient treat without regional block , patient often experience `` rebound pain '' -- pain occur 12-24 hour surgery subjectively bad patient treat without regional block . Therefore , investigator propose use continuous infusion anesthetic order provide sustain pain control post-operatively . Preoperatively , patient randomize single shot peripheral nerve block versus continuous infusion peripheral nerve block . Post-operatively , pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( 1-100 ) prior discharge PACU . Time discharge amount pain medication take record . Patients contact certain time interval postoperatively assess pain scale pain medication intake . Patients see routine post-operative follow-up visit assess satisfaction , pain , residual neurological symptom , sign infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose The purpose randomize prospective study compare post-operative pain control extremity fracture fixation surgery patient receive single shot versus continuous peripheral nerve block . Scientific Scholarly Rationale Peripheral nerve block well studied literature generally good result control post operative pain follow orthopaedic surgery 1-4 . Regional anesthesia many benefit . It provide excellent intraoperative anesthesia muscle relaxation well analgesia continue post-operative period . Airway manipulation avoid , post-operative nausea vomit diminish , post-anesthesia care unit stay shorten , few nursing intervention post-anesthesia care unit required5-6 . Patients operative fixation extremity fracture ( ankle , wrist , forearm ) typically ambulatory patient . However , many become hospitalized overnight secondary inadequate pain control , increase hospital cost . Goldstein et al . show patient underwent popliteal block ankle fracture fixation demonstrate significantly good pain control immediately postoperatively7 . The need overnight hospitalization secondary pain decrease , nonsurgical operating room time . Despite success regional anesthesia , phenomenon know `` rebound pain '' show occur original block wear off7-9 . Patients block experience significantly increase pain compare without block approximately 12-24 hour surgery . This control early narcotic administration source significant discomfort patient recognize treated time . A study show continuous infusion various numb agent efficacious prolong pain control , even ambulatory setting10-12 . Nevertheless , study thus perform randomized prospective control trial study efficacy continuous infusion therapy pain control follow extremity fracture surgery . Aims 1 . To determine effectiveness continuously infuse regional anesthetic pain control extremity fracture surgery 2 . To determine effect rebound pain patient satisfaction surgery Description study study procedure Consent All patient treat open reduction internal fixation foot , ankle , tibia , elbow , forearm wrist fracture New York University Medical Center , NYU-Hospital Joint Diseases ask participate study . At patient preoperative office visit , ask participate study provide copy consent form time take home . All question answer ask verbally consent part study . Patients opportunity either sign write consent form wait till surgical date think study additional question may . At time surgery , patient consent surgery . If patient give write consent preoperative visit , ask question study . All question answer . They ask verbally willing participate study , respond yes , write consent obtain time . Randomization Patients randomize ( use online randomizer , similar flip coin ) one two anesthetic protocol : regional block single dose anesthetic versus regional block continuous infusion use OnQ pump . If reason , anesthesiologist feel patient would benefit one type anesthesia another , patient remove study give type anesthesia . Intervention Patients randomize one two anesthetic protocol : general anesthesia/sedation single shot , peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia/sedation continuous , peripheral nerve block . All anesthesia provide attend anesthesiologist without anesthesiology resident/CRNA . Patients standard ASA monitor place ( pulse oximeter , blood pressure , EKG ) intravenous line start . Sedation give use combination midazolam ( 1-4 mg ) fentanyl ( 25-100 mcg ) . Patients group receive ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block . The block either infraclavicular brachial plexus block popliteal nerve block , depend location fracture . The appropriate region prepped chlorohexidine solution appropriate surgical side appropriate site visualize ultrasound . For group receive single shot block , 22 gauge , 3.5 inch needle use 20cc 2 % lidocaine 1:200,000 epinephrine + 20 cc 0.5 % bupivacaine 1:300,000 epinephrine inject around nerve confirm negative aspiration every 5 cc . For receive continuous infusion , 17 gauge Tuohy needle use 20cc 2 % lidocaine epinephrine + 20 cc 0.5 % bupivacaine 1:300,000 epinephrine inject around nerve confirm negative aspiration every 5cc . Once injection complete , indwell catheter place tip location confirm secured skin . After placement regional block , general anesthesia/sedation administer maintain discretion anesthesiologist . Induction anesthesia involve IV propofol ( 2mg/kg ) fentanyl ( 1-2mcg/kg ) . Neuromuscular blockade use discretion anesthesiologist reverse appropriately . Anesthetic maintenance involve inhalational agent , IV agent , air , oxygen . Fentanyl intraoperative analgesic use dose determined anesthesiologist . After completion surgery , patient take PACU continuous catheter OnQ pump attach . The patient begin receive continuous infusion 0.2 % ropivacaine catheter rate 8 cc/hr . The patient discharge home catheter 48 hour . The study participant self-discontinue catheter 2 day . This involve remove tegaderm dress gently pull catheter skin . A bandage may apply . Germaine Cuff , investigator anesthesiology RN , available via phone answer question study participant may regard discontinuation catheter . Breakthrough pain PACU treat IV fentanyl PO Percocet need . Postoperatively , patient discharge home prescription Percocet 5/325 instruction take 1-2 tab every 4-6hrs need pain . Data collection Location type surgical procedure , duration procedure , duration intravenous sedation also record . Total time operate room also note . Time admit PACU , time clinically ready discharge , time actually discharge , PACU medication nausea/vomiting PACU med pain record prior discharge . Post-operative pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( 0-100 ) prior discharge PACU . Time discharge amount pain medication take PACU record . Patients contact 8 hour , 12 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour 72hrs surgery operative surgeon research coordinator ass pain scale pain medication intake . Patients see routine post-operative follow-up visit two , six , twelve , twenty-four , fifty-two week . At time , patient assess pain , residual neurological symptom , sign infection . Patients also ask satisfied postoperative pain control . Total duration study fifty-two week . Data collection document distribute patient time surgery assist patient understanding .</detailed_description>
