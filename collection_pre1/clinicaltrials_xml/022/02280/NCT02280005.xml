	<brief_title>24 Hour Use Wearable Artificial Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo 24 hour in-hospital treatment Wearable Artificial Kidney ( WAK ) . Up 10 subject ESRD complete protocol entirety . The objective protocol provide additional preliminary data support hypothesis WAK safely effectively deliver dialysis therapy least equal current standard care treatment ESRD use conventional machine thrice weekly hemodialysis treatment . These objective would accomplish absence adverse event treatment WAK , along effective removal fluid solutes least equal delivered conventional currently use dialysis machine . The WAK investigational device use study . The reason trial advance eventual approval device legally commercialize potentially may respond unmet public health need improve outcome reduce cost treatment ESRD patient .</detailed_description>
