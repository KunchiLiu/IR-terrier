	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Andrographis Paniculata Purified Standardized Extract ( ApE ) Patients With Multiple Sclerosis ( MS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Multiple sclerosis chronic inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system predominantly affect young adult ( 1 ) . Although etiology yet elucidate , evidence point autoimmune pathogenesis think self-reactive myelin-specific cluster differentiation four eight ( CD4 ) ( CD8 ) T cell , play important role react destroy myelin sheath ( 2 ) . No plasma biomarkers determine disease activity routine clinical measurement , existence pattern pro-inflammatory cytokine describe , range increase Interferon ( IFN ) , Tumoral Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNFa ) Interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) , well decline Interleukin10 ( IL10 ) Interleukin 4 ( IL4 ) anti-inflammatory cytokine ( 3 ) . To date , common treatment MS Interferon beta immunomodulation , although cost / effectiveness questioned4 . Regardless progressive form existence outbreak , fatigue symptom one frequent disable one patient MS . The propose pathogenic mechanism multiple , although exact pathophysiology unknown . Also , still treatment proven completely effective stop progression disease ( 5 ) . Description botanical drug use clinical research : The botanical drug use clinical research , phytopharmaceutical tablet make Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) contain purify , standardize patent extract Andrographis paniculata Nees ( Acanthaceae ) { U.S. Patent : 8,084,495 B2 ; Date : Dec. 27 , 2011 } ( ApE ) . This medicinal annual plant , native India China whose active compound bitter diterpenoid lactones especially 14-deoxyandrographolide , Neoandrographolide specially Andrographolide , proven particularly effective regulate immune response ( 7 , 9 ) . The cellular molecular mechanism responsible immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory property Andrographolide , part still unknown . However , recent study vitro vivo assay indicate 10 micromol ( ÂµM ) per liter inhibits Tumoral Necrosis Factor Beta ( NF-kB ) . Specifically , Andrographolide concentrations 10 micromol ( uM ) per liter interferes DNA bind NF-kB ( 10 ) , reduce expression COX-2 neutrophil induce Formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine ( fMLP ) Platelet Activating Factor ( PAF ) . Moreover , Andrographolide reduce Interferon gamma ( IFNg ) IL-2 production Concanavalin A ( Con A ) induce T-cells , without affect cell viability induce apoptosis , also diminish thymocyte apoptosis induce corticosteroid . Furthermore , Andrographolide 14-deoxyandrographolide capable inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) phosphorylation T cell neutrophil , respectively ( 11 , 12 ) . Security setting : Toxicity Tolerance Analysis acute sub-chronic toxicity ApE rodents pig , use basic component ApE carry laboratory Institute Pharmacology Toxicology , Universidad Austral de Chile , accord guideline Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) Food Administration Agency ( FDA ) . Also , clinical phase I II clinical study perform , plus controlled daily treatment 12 patient different rheumatoid condition 8 patient Recurrent Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) five year . All observation prove wide range dosage safety without detect toxic effect therapeutic dose 2 milligram per kilogram body weight . Hypothesis : In experimental inflammatory human autoimmune disease , Rheumatoid arthritis relate condition ( 17 , 19 ) , also animal model Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis ( EAE ) induce , recently show Andrographolide significantly reduce clinical symptom outcome disease ( 6 ) , propose clinical study RRMS .</detailed_description>
