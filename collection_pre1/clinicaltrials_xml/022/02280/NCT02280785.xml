	<brief_summary>Brentuximab vedotin antibody-drug conjugate target CD30 , one surface antigen express lymphoma cell . Fanale MA , et al . report result phase I study weekly dosing brentuximab vedotin patient relapsed/refractory CD30-positive hematologic malignancy ( Clin Cancer Res . 2012 ) show tumor regression 85 % patient . Thus , overall objective response rate 59 % ( 24/44 ) include 34 % ( n = 14 ) complete remission . This study mainly include Hodgkin lymphoma ( n = 38 ) anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( n = 5 ) . However , efficacy type NHL never report although study enrol one patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma otherwise specify ( PTCL-NOS ) . CD30 ( TNFRSF8 ) transmembrane glycoprotein tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily , involve signal transduction via activation NF-κB pathway mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPKs ) , ultimately modulate cell growth , proliferation apoptosis . CD30 non-lineage-specific activation marker express scattered B T immunoblasts . In addition , subset case virtually T-cell lymphoma entity may also express CD30 variable generally low level . In fact , recent study 22 patient extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma show 75 % positive rate CD30 expression ( 75 % ) . Moreover , CD30 expression also document tumor sample EB virus positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( EBV + DLBCL ) elderly ( 28.9 % , 11/38 ) . Therefore , Brentuximab vedotin may potential benefit patient CD30-positive NHL anaplastic large cell lymphoma CD30-positive PTCLs , NOS . Considering role CD30 signal transduction pathway associated tumor growth proliferation , expression may associate tumor aggressiveness . In accordance , likely relapse refractory NHLs may CD30 expression , potential benefit promise agent salvage therapy deserve investigate patient high risk treatment failure . Thus , design phase II study relapse refractory NHL patient . This study explore safety activity dose every 3 week Brentuximab vedotin patient relapse refractory CD30-positive NHL anaplastic large cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The principal investigator use Simon two-stage minimax design base overall response rate . Overall disease control rate calculate percent patient confirm complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) radiographic response include CT and/or PET scan . We assume P0 20 % , designate target rate ( P1 ) 40 % . Under error probability ( α=0.05 , β=0.20 ) , eighteen patient enrol first stage . If overall disease control rate ≤ 4/18 first stage , study stop . If , study recruit patient 33 consider 20 % drop rate . Intent-to-treat analysis apply primary secondary efficacy endpoint . Response rate analyze base response criterion accord Cheson 2007 ( Cheson BD , et al . J Clin Oncol 2007 ; 25 ( 5 ) :579-586 ) , data relate overall response rate analyze statistical analysis include Chi test evaluate predictive factor response study drug . Overall rate disease control : CR , PR SD Progression-free survival : Time date treatment start date death due cause date disease progression ( Up 36months ) Data relate survival rate patient analyze base log-rank test Kaplan-Meier method .</detailed_description>
