	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . Researchers want test human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -associated cancer . Objective : - The purpose study determine safe number cell infuse see particular tumor-fighting cell ( Anti-HPV E6 ) shrink tumor associate HPV test toxicity treatment . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-66 HPV-16-associated cancer . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti HPV E6 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti HPV E6 cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting HPV-16 E6 HPV-Associated Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Metastatic refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -16+ cancer ( cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal , oropharyngeal cancer ) incurable poorly palliate standard therapy . - HPV-16+ cancer constitutively express HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein , absent healthy human tissue . - Administration T cell receptor ( TCR ) gene engineer T cell induce objective tumor response certain malignancy . - T cell genetically engineer TCR target HPV-16 E6 ( E6 TCR ) display specific reactivity HLA-A2+ , HPV-16+ target cell . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective - To determine safe dose administration autologous T cell transduce anti-HPV-16 E6 TCR aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen . - To determine objective tumor response rate ( Complete Partial Response ) duration patient metastatic recurrent/refractory HPV-16+ cancer treat regimen . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients great equal 18 year old less equal 70 year old metastatic refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer . - Prior first line systemic therapy require unless patient decline standard treatment . - Patients must HLA-A 02:01-positive . DESIGN : - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine - On day 0 patient receive transduced lymphocyte begin high dose aldesleukin - The study begin phase I dose escalation . After MTD cell dose determine , patient enrol phase II portion study . - Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4 6 week treatment every 1-6 month disease progression - Following dose escalation phase 9 18 patient , initially 21 evaluable patient enrol phase II portion study . If 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol . If 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol . The accrual ceiling set 61 patient . Provided 1 patient every 6 week enrol onto trial , approximately 4 year may need accrue maximum number patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Measurable metastatic refractory/recurrent HPV16+ cancer ( determine situ hybridization ( ISH ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) base test ) . 2 . Patients must HLAA 02:01positive . 3 . All patient must receive prior first line standard therapy decline standard therapy , either nonresponders ( progressive disease ) recur . 4 . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . 5 . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . 6 . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document . 7 . Willing sign durable power attorney 8 . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . 9 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 10 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study 4 month treatment . Patients must willing undergo test HPV16 prior become pregnant . 11 . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 12 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 13 . Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm3 without support filgrastim . WBC great equal 3000/mm3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dL 14 . Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL 15 . More 4 week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding . There potentially dangerous side effect treatment fetus infant . 2 . Active systemic infection ( e.g . : require antiinfective treatment ) , coagulation disorder active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 3 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 4 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 5 . Concurrent systemic steroid therapy . 6 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction cyclophosphamide fludarabine . 7 . History coronary revascularization ischemic symptom . 8 . Documented LVEF less equal 45 % test .
