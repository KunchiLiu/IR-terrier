	<brief_summary>Hemophilia A X-linked recessive , congenital bleeding disorder cause deficient defective coagulation factor VIII ( FVIII ) . Prophylaxis recommend standard care boy severe haemophilia WHO World Federation Of Hemophilia ( WFH ) . The efficacy safety prophylaxis prevent bleeds arthropathy patient hemophilia confirm well-designed clinical studies.To keep factor level 1 % , standard dosage patient severe hemophilia A 20-40 Units /kg/infusion ( average 30 Units /kg ) every day three time week . This dosage high consumption factor , 5000-6000 international unit ( IU ) /kg/year . The high consumption factor cost present major barrier use standard prophylaxis many country particularly develop world . In China majority boys severe hemophilia A pay on-demand treatment low-dose prophylaxis . Ao affordability patient solve many patient get chance receive standard prophylaxis . This study design evaluate Annual Bleeding rate ( ABR ) , joint health outcome QoL outcomes subject use ADVATE ( Recombinant Human Coagulation Factor VIII injection ) standard prophylaxis condition routine practice .</brief_summary>
