	<brief_summary>Parents positively influence child 's alcohol use . One strategy use provide child alcohol , believe best way teach child drink responsibly . The impact parental supply well understood may unintentionally harmful . This study research consequence parental supply within broad context parent , child peer relationship . It help determine parental supply influence different pattern adolescent alcohol consumption time , provide essential information help parent prevent alcohol misuse child . Parents play pivotal role prevention alcohol misuse , present n't know exactly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : The Australian Parental Supply Alcohol Longitudinal Study ( APSALS ) : Can parent teach child drink alcohol responsibly ? Or , one drop drop many ? Background : The Australian Parental Supply Alcohol Longitudinal Study ( APSALS ) establish investigate short- long-term association exposure parental alcohol provision , early adolescent alcohol initiation , subsequent alcohol use , alcohol-related harm , control wide range parental , child , familial , peer , contextual covariates . The cohort commence 1927 parent-child dyad comprise Australian Grade 7 school student , parent/guardian . Baseline , one- two-year follow-up data collect , three-year follow-up underway . The data collect include child , familial , parental , peer factor address demographic , alcohol use supply , parent practice , substance use , adolescent behaviour , peer influence . Baseline data show 5.8 % Grade 7 adolescent initiate alcohol consumption ( whole serve alcohol ) . Thus , cohort ideal prospectively examine predictor initiation progression alcohol use , increase markedly adolescence . Results date highlight importance distinguish sip drink full serf alcohol measurement adolescent alcohol use represent distinct behaviour occur different environment . Aims : The aim study determine : 1 . Parental supply associate progression ( acceleration/deceleration ) adolescent drinking time ; 2 . The immediate broad contextual factor mediate moderate relationship parental supply progression adolescent drinking time . Design : A longitudinal study across three state Australia ( New South Wales , Tasmania , Western Australia ) . Recruitment : Catholic , Independent Government school NSW , Tasmania Western Australia . Data analysis : Logistic binomial regression , multi-level modelling use , latent growth curve modelling ( LGCM ) within framework structural equation model ( SEM ) . Moderating mediate variable , time variant ( e.g. , association alcohol use peer ) time-invariant ( e.g . gender ) model . Outcome variable model use appropriate parametric distribution - Poisson distribution count data outcomes binomial distribution categorical data outcome . All analysis conduct MPlus v5.2 Stata . As recommended Graham imputation miss data do . Sample size calculation : Due flexibility model approach take ( i.e. , number parameter allow vary ) , number different scenario test determine adequate sample size . The primary interest difference drink time group supply supplied alcohol . Thus , regression analysis address drink dummy-coded `` parental supply '' variable . It hypothesise parental supply alcohol would alter trajectory harmful drinking regression coefficient Â±0.2 . This regression coefficient equivalent medium effect size difference group , result unexpected give past research . It assume attrition would result around 20 % miss data subsequent measurement occasion . Based simulation study , factor potential mediator moderator , 600 child require minimum . However , small cell size association may affect power , final sample ~1800 child parent recruit .</detailed_description>
