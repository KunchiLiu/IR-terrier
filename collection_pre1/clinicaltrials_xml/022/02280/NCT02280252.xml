	<brief_summary>The need understand LABC especially compel population country limit resource , breast cancer incidence relatively low , mortality comparably high . In settings access appropriate cancer care characteristically limit often plainly nonexistent . In contrast economically developed nation , average few 20 % woman present breast cancer advance stage , LABC metastatic disease common stag presentation 50 % woman Latin America , Asia Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The term ―locally advance breast cancer ( LABC ) commonly include tumor whose maximum diameter 5 cm ( T3 ) large , present involvement chest wall skin . Surprisingly , simultaneous presence clinically detectable distant metastasis relatively infrequent ( ~8 % ) , peculiar find since 73 % large tumor possible document shed tumor cell blood . While LABC become rare clinical presentation breast cancer general population result improve early detection mammographic screening , remain relatively common among minority woman low socioeconomic status . For instance , consecutive series 363 African-American woman present large urban hospital , one three woman newly diagnose breast cancer LABC . It well document although incidence breast cancer among African-Americans low among white woman , breast cancer mortality African-Americans significantly high . In 1998 , American Cancer Society , National Cancer Institute Centers Disease Control Prevention report overall downward trend cancer incidence mortality 1990 1995 cancer combine . Many minority medically underserved population , however , share equally improvement . These patient continue encounter multifactorial barrier early detection care , warrant intervention improve access . At time , equally important offer best chance survival underserved woman already avail medical care . Paradoxically , medical community aware inadequate accrual minority patient clinical trial , trial exist LABC .</detailed_description>
