	<brief_summary>The goal study learn Inner Resources Veterans ( IRV ) meditation therapy help Veterans Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . PTSD disorder occur exposure one traumatic experience . People PTSD may experience anxiety , pay extra attention surroundings , involuntarily remember traumatic experience , and/or want avoid situation symptom increase . MTBI may result blast explosion , pressure blast potentially disrupt brain 's structure function . At time , well know PTSD mTBI may affect . In study , investigator look behavioral neurological change ( change brain ) reduction PTSD symptom may come participate treatment . The investigator interested determine treatment reverse change brain cause PTSD mTBI . To help investigator understand change brain function , participant complete functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan either 8-week course IRV 8 week education PTSD mTBI . Participation help investigator understand therapy PTSD mTBI impact brain 's response emotion therapeutic process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 18-22 % Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) Veterans diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , 15-30 % Veterans report mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . The effect mTBI PTSD evident since military personnel first come home continue difficult eradicate . At 3-4 month post-deployment , OIF Veterans mild TBI likely endorse PTSD symptom without mTBI . The co-morbidity may long-lasting , least recurrent , TBI-related symptom strongly associate traumatic stress five year injury . In examination factor associate postconcussive symptom , PTSD strong factor . In active duty marine , mTBI deployment predict PTSD deployment , study OEF-OIF-OND Veterans , 57.3 % mTBI PTSD . The literature mTBI co-morbid PTSD affect effect Veterans several year post-deployment sparse . Treatment recommendation specific Veterans mTBI PTSD flux , treatment address disorder independently , may effective two disorder co-occur . Further impact successful treatment Veterans fact many Veterans seek treatment , part due distance travel obtain VA service stigma . Treatments accessible improve symptom patient mTBI PTSD alone may facilitate rehabilitation Veterans co-morbid mTBI PTSD . Meditation suggest effective Veterans PTSD civilians TBI , improve quality life . The current study propose type meditation target Veterans , Inner Resources Veterans ( IRV ) . Inner Resources Veterans ( IRV ) meditation intervention base Inner Resources Stress , intervention utilizes mindfulness , technique encourage non-judgmental attention oneself present moment . The Inner Resources protocol target PTSD associate reduced PTSD anxiety symptom , reduce number depressive symptom , depression remission 9-month follow-up , well increase perceive self-efficacy . Pilot result older combat Veterans PTSD indicate Inner Resources safe , feasible , acceptable intervention . In previous study IRV veteran Michael E. DeBakey VA , control condition provide education symptom effect PTSD . For example , subject learn recognize circumstance trigger symptom , identify participate healthy activity , monitor sleep . In addition change functional psychological symptom neural pathway , IRV would offer Veterans treatment could utilize whenever challenging situation occur regardless location . Since treatment would relatively cost-free initial training , IRV could also dramatically reduce financial burden Veterans VA. Few treatment study focus Veterans co-morbid mTBI PTSD support innovation study , generation community integration data relate change functional connectivity .</detailed_description>
