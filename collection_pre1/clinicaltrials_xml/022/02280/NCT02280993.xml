	<brief_summary>To combine Brentuximab Vedotin Dexamethasone , AraC Cisplatin ( DHAP ) chemotherapy patient Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) refractory first line chemotherapy first relapse expect induce significantly high ( metabolic ) complete remission ( CR ) rate prior consolidation BEAM , judge FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) -PET negativity . This compare publish data DHAP salvage . Increasing metabolic CR rate prior consolidation high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) expect improve progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
