	<brief_title>Clinical Study Asahi ViE Dialyzer Canada</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate specific parameter related ViE-21 performance include ( A ) Performance evaluate uremic solute removal rate urea , creatinine , ALB B2-MG , ( B ) Determination KUF , ( C ) Biocompatibility evaluate WBC , PLT C3a measurement , ( D ) Type number AEs , ( E ) Type number device malfunction . Prospective , open-label , non-randomized , single-armed , control study . Each patient shall data collect six dialysis session control dialyzer prior 36 session ViE-21 . These data shall basis comparison ViE-21 performance . These data utilize support US Regulatory Submission . Note : ALB : albumin , B2-MG : beta-2-microglobulin , KUF : coefficient ultrafiltration , WBC : white blood cell , PLT : platelet , C3a : activate complement 3 , AE : adverse event</detailed_description>
