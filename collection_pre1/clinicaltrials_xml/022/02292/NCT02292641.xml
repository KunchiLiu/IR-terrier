	<brief_summary>In UK approximately 28,000 patient per year diagnose bowel cancer . Further 15-20 % develop pelvic recurrence . In significant proportion patient ( 15-20 % ) , tumour extend beyond surgeon routinely remove require extensive ( exenterative ) surgery achieve successful removal tumour . Currently MRI use assessment pelvic tumour PET/CT use order prove extrapelvic disease , selection patient undergo complex surgery . The investigator previously show , single centre retrospective analysis , use specific stag system tumour possible predict likelihood surgical success overall survival outcome . Until today national guideline group patient . The investigator want test whether standardize assessment advance tumour help improve outcome patient well surgical planning . The investigator also want show information scan give valuable data regard long term outcomes likelihood surgical success . This multicentre prospective trial patient , require extensive surgery , use stag classification . The high resolution MRI scan patient undergo surgery report use previously validate system . It hop study result well standarised method assess advanced pelvic cancer , intent improve surgical plan overall patient management , may increase possibility surgical curative resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Outcomes Primary Recurrent Rectal Sigmoid Cancer With Tumour Extending Beyond TME Plane ( Beyond TME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently validate criterion guideline judge whether advanced primary recurrent colorectal cancer successfully remove select patient undergo form radical surgery exenterative surgery . We propose validate detailed evaluation image tumour distribution within pelvis , enable clear selection criterion establish improve surgical planning . This result overall improvement curative surgery currently 67 % best global series . Furthermore , overall 3 year cancer specific survival patient undergoing form surgery without detailed MRI plan 35 % . Incorrect preoperative stag plan result patient undergo unnecessary surgery ( 40 % ) refuse potentially curative operation 17 % case . The design study able show diagnostic accuracy use propose staging system . The stag system validate survival outcome , also take account surgical morbidity outcomes Quality Of Life measure . The primary endpoint demonstrate histopathological complete resection clear margin rate ( R0 ) &gt; great 67 % ( documented current literature ) achieve use MRI compartmental classification plan exenterative surgery .</detailed_description>
