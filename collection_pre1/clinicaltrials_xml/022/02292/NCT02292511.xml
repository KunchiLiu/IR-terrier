	<brief_title>Mind-motor Exercise Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Self-reported Cognitive Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia identify global health concern increase incidence globally . Regardless whether individual self-reported cognitive complaint ( CCs ) objective impairment , increased risk cognitive decline , comparable early mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) brain atrophy increase risk progression towards Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . People express worry memory cognition show increase risk cognitive decline . If prevention program could delay onset dementia even part at-risk population , could decrease disease prevalence significantly . The risk cognitive impairment dementia increase type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) T2D accelerate progression MCI dementia . The propose mind-motor intervention prevention cognitive decline T2D call square stepping exercise ( SSE ) . The SSE program develop Shigematsu Okura ( 2005 ) best describe visuospatial work memory task step response . There 200 pattern develop program progress simple advance stepping pattern . The primary focus Shigematsu colleague ' research examine impact SSE fall risk factor mobility old adult . Within research find SSE improves low extremity functional fitness , reduce fall risk , improve overall fitness older adult compare walking strength balance training . In combination Dr. Shigematsu 's research Japan healthy old adult , investigator aim provide significant evidence base SSE internationally within varied population , include old adult subjective cognitive complaint different chronic disease . In collaboration Dr. Shigematsu , investigator execute SSE study Canadian Centre Activity Aging currently run study community Woodstock , ON . Preliminary evidence show 6-month exercise plus mind-motor training period , participant improve global cognitive functioning , verbal learn memory , verbal fluency , compare exercise control group . Most recently , Shigematsu colleague find SSE program improve memory executive function 6-month pilot study . The overarch goal investigator healthy age ; research goal aim evaluate intervention tool prevention cognitive decline one early marker cognitive decline , subjective complaint . As well , goal intervention strategy maintain mobility balance advance age chronic disease . The T2D population increase risk decline add component self-management diabetes insulin treatment make crucial maintain adequate cognition independence population . Study Design : This study 24-week Proof-of-Concept randomized control trial ( 1:1 allocation ) whereby consent eligible participant randomize either : 1 ) SSE intervention group 2 ) usual-care , wait-list control group . Participants recruit St. Joseph 's Primary Care Diabetes Support Program ( SJHC- PCDSP ) study intervention conduct community location London , Ontario . This single blind study . All assessment do pre-intervention ( V0 ) post-intervention ( V2 ) , interim assessment 12-weeks ( V1 ) ( exception sensorimotor ) . Assessments take place SJHC-PCDSP Western University . One assessment do online either participant 's home SJHC-PCDSP ( solely complete participant ) ( i.e . Cambridge Brain Sciences ) . We use blocked randomization thus , participant begin complete trial within wave . Participants : All participant require self-report cognitive complaint ; eligibility determine , participant ask question cognition . Participants undergo number measurement baseline , use describe study sample . These measure include : ) baseline cognition : Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) Clock Drawing Test ; ii ) baseline fitness : Step test iii ) Anthropometric measure : weight , height , waist circumference ; iv ) history physical mental activity : Leisure Activities questionnaire v ) clinic blood work value HbA1c , creatine ( eGFR ) , lipid assessment obtain clinic electronic medical record ( EMR ) vi ) demographic information . Current medication , blood pressure patient medical history also obtain EMRs . Intervention SSE ( Intervention ) Group : Participants Square Stepping Exercise group group-based mind-motor intervention program . Participants come community location 60 minute one day per week participate SSE program . An instructor present demonstrate walking pattern gridded mat . Participants must memorize complete pattern group , encourage help one another promote social engagement . Eighty percent group must successfully complete pattern move next pattern . There 200 pattern increase difficulty beginner , intermediate advance . If participant struggle keep group , catch-up session make available assist participant . Participants ask use smartphone application ( Healthebrain ) 10 minute per day 2 pattern homework supplement SSE program . Participants able use smartphones ( apple android device ) give smartphone use duration study need . Wait-List Control Group : The investigator opt use wait-list control group study order see difference intervention usual care T2D.The control group wait list participate 24-week SSE program , commence measurement complete group . The class offer free charge .</detailed_description>
