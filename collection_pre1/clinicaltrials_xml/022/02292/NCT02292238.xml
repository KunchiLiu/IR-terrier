	<brief_summary>General Investigational Plan Study Objectives The goal proposal determine whether enhance brain glucose utilization minimizes cognitive decline patient Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( AMCI ) mild Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) dementia . We propose proof concept double-blind , placebo control pilot study determine increase brain thiamine availability investigational new drug benfotiamine , minimize decline glucose utilization slow cognitive decline associate progression AMCI/AD dementia . Specifically , objectives two-fold : - To test whether increase brain thiamine administer 600 mg per day ( 300 mg/morning 300 mg/evening ) benfotiamine one year slow cognitive decline patient measure Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS-COG ) . - To determine whether increase brain thiamine availability 600 mg ( 300 mg/morning 300 mg/evening ) per day benfotiamine one year slow decline brain glucose metabolism patient measure Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FGPET ) posterior cingulate . We also carry follow secondary objective : - Assess difference secondary clinical outcome measure ( NPI , ADCSADL , CDR , Buschke ) benfotiamine placebo group whether specific cognitive domain ( ie : activity daily live , learn memory verbal memory , behavioral , etc . ) driving change . - Compare ADAS-COG change score benfotiamine placebo group within stratum define initial cognitive impairment , attempt identify population benefit benfotiamine . - Compare change glucose utilization benfotiamine placebo group secondary Regions Interest ( ROIs ) include hippocampus , prefrontal region entorhinal cortex . - Compare change whole brain glucose utilization benfotiamine placebo group use statistical parametric mapping ( SPM ) . - Assess correlation change glucose utilization change ADAS Cog . - Determine ApoE4 genotype alters response benfotiamine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This study conduct Burke Rehabilitation Hospital IRB protocol . Wplan accrue total 76 male and/or female patient ( &gt; 65 year ) diagnosis AMCI/AD dementia also amyloid positive PET scan . Patients randomize blind either benfotiamine placebo group . Because unknown whether differential response treatment accord initial cognitive impairment , participant stratify accord median MMSE cut-off score historical METS population &gt; 65 year old MMSE &gt; 21 . In double-blind study , patient caregiver , well physician , clinician , coordinator investigator interact patient , unaware treatment assignment . Treatment assignment available safety-monitoring physician , Dr. Michael Reding , unnecessary subject contact . If necessary , code reveal Dr. Reding pharmacist , Dr. Thomas Grandville . Each patient make six visit Memory Evaluation Treatment Service ( METS ) clinic Burke Rehabilitation Hospital . Information medication use , vital sign , outcome measure , compliance safety/tolerability collect time point . The screen visit ( visit 1 ) take place within 30 day prior baseline visit ( visit 2 ) . Informed consent/assent obtain subject his/her caregiver prior conduct study related procedure . During screen visit review inclusion/exclusion criterion complete along collection demographic data , disease history , information prior concomitant medication . A complete medical history , physical examination , neurological examination , include MMSE , CDR , CSDD vital sign , collect . Blood drawn ass blood glucose Patients diagnose likely Alzheimer patient hyperglycemic amyloid PET scan . Only patient diagnosis AD positive amyloid scan include . Prior baseline ( visit 2 ) , FDGPET study complete subject . At baseline visit ( visit 2 ) blood drawn determine APOE thiamine ( vitamin B1 status ) . At visit 2-6 , information concomitant medication update , vitals take , medication compliance assess follow study measure administer : Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ( ADASCog ) , Buschke SRT , Neuropsychological Inventory ( NPI ) , Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( CDR ) Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities Daily Living ( ADCS-ADLs ) . The final PET scan conduct approximately one week prior last visit . In addition safety assessment time visit , patient receive call clinical coordinator week 2 6 assess adverse event . The benfotiamine placebo dispense pharmacy Burke direction Thomas Grandville , D. Pharm . The caregiver administer drug since patient memory problem may forget take regular basis . In placebo group , active compound benfotiamine replace microcrystalline cellulose . The component , shape color identical treatment . Caregivers instruct oversee administration study medication prescribe ensure compliance . A record number capsule dispense , number return , actual number take record scheduled visit . Each patient treat 12 month . The study cognitive measure include : ADAS-Cog ( primary outcome measure ) , Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities Daily Living , Neuropsychiatric Inventory , Clinical Dementia Rating Scale , Buschke Selective Reminding Test ( SRT ) . standard diagnostic tool assessment verbal memory . The Biological/Mechanistic Outcome Measures FDG-PET Scanning Procedures Data Analysis Preliminary analysis conduct describe study sample confirm relationship level glucose utilization severity cognitive impairment . For continuous variable ( eg cognitive function , glucose utilization ) , first examine distribution assess normality assumption . We perform transformation need stabilize variance , reduce skewness kurtosis . We use mean ( sd ) proportion n ( % ) characterize study sample . T-tests Chi-square , Wilcoxon rank sum test Fisher , appropriate , use assess difference patient characteristic accord treatment group . We use spearman correlation coefficient linear regression , unadjusted adjusted covariates , assess relationship FDG-PET MMSE whole population well MMSE stratify group examine relationship initial MMSE score glucose uptake . All analyse test study hypothesis run intention treat ( ITT ) . Missing observation address use method last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) .</detailed_description>
