	<brief_title>Maternal Microchimerism Lymph Nodes Infants With Biliary Atresia Time Kasai 's Operation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon operation infant non-syndromatic biliary atresia ( BA , common form ) , surgeon almost invariably note prominent find multiple swollen lymph node 2 cm size porta hepatis small bowel mesentery may constitute grape like complex . Same-age infant laparotomized pathology commonly present node . Biliary atresia disease newborn fatal left untreated . Histologically correspond degeneration intra- und extra hepatic bile duct within part specific inflammatory infiltrate progressive cirrhosis . The etiology rare constant disease ( 1:8-1:15.000 ) unknown . Currently BA etiology research two main avenue pursue : 1 . Virally induced perinatal ( auto ) immune process suspect . An experimental form BA provoke infect murine mother dsRNA-viruses e.g . Rhesus-rotaviruses Reo-viruses mouse , vaccination mother prevent experimental BA . The importance γ/δ-T-cell IL17/IL 23 pathway , BA currently probe . However , group syngenic animal treat batch virus BA tend inconstant limited extrahepatic bile duct validity animal model issue . 2 . The direction research primarily rely experiment involve newborn animal : There indication pregnancy placental barrier may become permeable maternal lymphocyte ( e.g . faulty silence T-cell attract chemokines decidual stroma cell ) already 2008 maternal lymphocyte demonstrate liver BA infant . Subsequently phenomenon materno-fetal microchimerism come focus BA ethiology research : context mixed materno-fetal immune reaction cell maternal origin could misdirect immature immune system infant auto-immunity act directly effectors graft vs. host like fashion . The importance mesenteric portal lymph node maturation immune system pregnancy report recently . Moreover demonstrate flow liver portal lymph node bidirectional . In In mouse frequence CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells found link mother immune status . We thus hypothesize prominently swell lymph node BA infant surgeon constantly encounter Kasai 's operation may hold key good understand pathophysiological important lymphocyte trafficking mechanism . In standard operation , Kasai-operation race increase liver cirrhosis make sense age 4 month , degrade rest major bile duct liver hilus ( call `` hilar plate '' ) resect , A Roux y-loop suture onto resection site . It shall drain contingent bile flow remain bile duct . The long term success rate tentative surgical cure moderate technical complexity invasiveness estimate ca . 15-20 % . In remain partly sucess may postpone necessity liver transplantation . We examine seven consecutive patient histologically proven biliary atresia whether periportal lymph node evidence maternal gentic material . Methods : 7 consecutive patient preoperative diagnosis BA include study . Other cause icterus prolongatus ( α1 anti-trypsin deficiency , Alagilles syndrom , PFIC etc . ) exclude amongst method technical successful ERCP ( 5/7 patient ) show absence intrahepatic bile duct . After obtain parent 's informed consent 2 ml EDTA whole blood collect mother infant . During Kasai 's operation one portal one mesenterial lymphnode sample ( Hannover Medical School ethical committee vote No.1650/11.12.2012 . After bipolar dissection mesenteric gap close 4-0 Vicryl suture . Lymph node disrupt mechanically DNA extract enzymatically ( QIAmp Kit , Qiagen , Hilden/Germany ) describe previously normalize 30 ug/ml . Short tandem repeat analysis realize multiplex PCR marker LIPOL , VWA , TH01 , D19S253 , CSF , PLA2A . FGA , D21S11 , D18S51 describe . Briefly , fragment length analysis perform Abi Prism 310 System GeneScan 3.11. software comparison mother 's infant 's blood lymph node DNA . Genetic single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) trace quantitative real time PCR chimerism analysis . Reactions execute iCycler iQ5 real-time PCR platform ( Bio-Rad ) use ABsolute QPCR Rox Mix ( Thermo scientific ) . Custom design primer probe provide Sigma-Aldrich . Control reactions normalization sample DNA perform amplify albumin gene .</detailed_description>
