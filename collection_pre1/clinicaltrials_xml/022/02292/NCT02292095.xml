	<brief_title>Effects Transverse Abdominis Plane Block Guided Ultrasound Postoperative Analgesia Quality Lives Among Patients Undergo Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence post-operative pain open inguinal hernia repair high accord larger-sample epidemic research . Meanwhile , investigator also find incidence CPSP herniorrhaphy 37.8 % among patient PCA , incidence neuropathic pain 37.5 % patient CPSP . European hernia society propose local infiltration anesthesia suggest patient without contraindication undergo inguinal hernia repair . Transverse abdominis plane block ( TABP ) , inject local anesthetic interval obliquus internus abdominis muscle transverse abdominal muscle could block abdominal nerve could alleviate pain postoperatively . TABP block two mainly nerve ( iliohypogastric nerve , ilioinguinal nerve ) inguinal hernia repair seem good effect relieve pain inguinal hernia repair . So investigators conduct randomize control trial investigate whether transversus abdominis plane block combine intravenous patient control analgesia superior intravenous patient control analgesia improving quality life reduce incidence chronic post-surgical pain . This study approve Medical Ethics Committee First Affiliated Hospital Chongqing Medical University . All potentially eligible participant ask give write informed consent enrol study . This study prospective , randomize , control clinical trial guide standard good clinical practice ( GCP ) , eligible participant divide two group : group TAPB group PCIA , ass outcome incidence acute chronic postoperative pain effect two method quality live patient undergo inguinal hernia repair . Participants group TAPB receive transversus abdominis plane block guide ultrasound end surgery also receive intravenous patient control analgesia surgery . Participants group PCIA receive intravenous patient control analgesia surgery . The primary outcome study VAS score rest motion 3 month postoperatively . The secondary outcome study chronic post-surgical pain 6 12 month postoperatively , acute post-operative pain , rescue medication incidence neuropathic pain 3 , 6,12 month postoperatively , also quality life measure EQ-5D questionnaire , adverse event associate postoperative analgesia . This study conduct supervision independent auditor . Every week , auditor check data participant day surgery conduct . Assessment pain intensity prognostic outcome must confirm auditor sample population . When disagreement surgeon anesthesiologist evaluate prognosis patient , auditor must solve disagreement discussion evaluator . Data double-entered two statistician limitation access lock statistical analysis</detailed_description>
