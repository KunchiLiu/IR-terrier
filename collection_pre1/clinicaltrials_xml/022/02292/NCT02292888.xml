	<brief_title>Can Changes Velocity Time Integral Serve Sensitive Indicator Monitoring Changes Stroke Volume ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Can change LVOT VTI passive leg raise ( PLR ) test serve sensitive indicator change SV CO hence volume responsiveness ? What Doppler LVOT VTI ? Placing Pulsed Wave Doppler gate LVOT immediately open aortic valve align Doppler beam parallel LVOT/aortic axis possible angle Doppler alignment &lt; 20˚ , one may obtain Doppler flow velocity measurement help measure LVOT VTI ( Velocity Time Integral ) . If one integrate velocity profile two time point ( i.e. , calculate area curve ) , distance traverse `` region blood '' flow period may estimate . Since flow velocity constant throughout flow cycle , flow velocity entire ejection period integrate measure `` distance traverse '' `` region blood . '' This integration flow velocity give period time call velocity-time integral ( VTI ) ( 1 ) yield length distance ( measure cm ) . Goal : Whether VTI ( LVOT ) measure deep transgastric ( deep TG ) transgastric long axis ( TG LAX ) view reflect change stroke volume ( SV ) hence cardiac output ( CO ) measure gold standard method ( PA CCO thermodilution ) passive leg raise test ( PLR ) . Hypothesis : A validated technique measure cardiac output ( CO ) use echocardiography calculate stroke volume product LVOT area LVOT VTI multiply product heart rate ( CO = SV x H/R ; SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI ) . The LVOT diameter individual less constant measurement . Therefore use formula mention ( SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI ) , LVOT area constant , SV proportional VTI . This mean PLR manoeuvre fluid bolus help achieve rise SV , reflect increase VTI well . If assumption true , increase value VTI baseline fluid challenge ( 10-15 % ) , identify volume responsive patient . Why investigator wish study ? A significant improvement field anesthesiology would occur could simple yet accurate relatively non-invasive tool correctly assess fluid responsiveness . Excessive fluid infuse operating room would prolong mechanical ventilation stay ICU negatively affect prognosis patient . While monitor CCO PA catheter considerable add expense , complication may indicate majority operative case . A simple non invasive tool use TEE significantly add understand hemodynamics help guide fluid therapy . If assumption prof correct , could simple , yet rapid bedside indicator CO . It could use simple tool ass fluid responsiveness . The fundamental reason fluid challenge ( PLR fluid bolus ) use ass whether increase stroke volume response ( 2 ) . If fluid loading fails improve stroke volume fluid challenge/loading serf useful purpose . In normal physiological condition ventricle operate ascend limb Frank-Starling curve . Once left ventricle start function 'flat ' portion Frank-Starling curve , fluid load little effect stroke volume . If LVOT VTI could show reflect SV adequately relatively simple non invasive dynamic bedside tool test fluid boluses result increase VTI hence SV . Volume responsiveness assess literature measure response fluid boluses PLR . Thus positive test PLR , VTI increase significantly reflect positive change SV CO , fluid would require . Whereas PLR , CO SV diminish reflected decrease VTI value compare baseline , subject would unlikely respond fluid therapy probably would require inotropic support . Why PLR ? A recent meta-analysis ( 3 ) , pool result eight recent study , confirm excellent value PLR predict fluid responsiveness critically ill patient global area receiver operate characteristic curve 0.95 . Limitations use Doppler VTI : However , use equation entail number assumption , include ( ) laminar blood flow area interrogate , ( b ) flat blunt flow velocity profile flow across entire CSA interrogate relatively uniform , ( c ) Doppler angle incidence Doppler beam main direction blood flow less 20 degree , underestimation flow velocity le 6 % . Study population : 50 adult patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery . Materials &amp; Methods : After institutional ethic committee approval personal informed consent , 50 patient undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery would include study . Patients significant arrhythmia , concomitant aortic aneurysm , esophageal pathology preclude use TEE would consider ineligible study . Patients would divide two group . Patients normal LV function mild LV systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &gt; 40 % ) ( 4 ) , assess preoperative echocardiography would comprise Group 1 , whereas preoperative LV moderate severe systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 40 % ) ( 4 ) would designate Group 2 . Anesthetic protocol : Patients would fast 8 hour precede operation . No i.v . fluid would administer period . Patients would pre-medicated usual cardiovascular medication 1mg Lorazepam night would receive 1-2 mg Midazolam arrival operation theatre . After initiate standard monitoring ( ECG , Pulse oximetry , NBP ) invasive line would introduce local anesthetic infiltration patient would receive supplemental oxygen via facemask . Induction anesthesia would include 0.05 mg kg_1 Midazolam 5 mcg kg_1 Fentanyl addition Sevoflurane 3-5 % titrated loss eyelash reflex . Tracheal intubation would facilitate Rocuronium 0.1 mg kg_1 . Anaesthesia would maintain Sevoflurane 1.5-2 % titrated end tidal value &gt; 1.5 % supplement additional dos fentanyl total dose 15-20 mg kg_1 . All patient would receive 500 ml lactate Ringer solution induction period . Hemodynamic Echocardiographic monitoring . A 7.0Fr triple lumen central line , 8.5 Fr PA sheath 7.0 Fr CCO ( Continuous Cardiac Output ) PA catheter 16 G femoral arterial canula would introduce prior induction anesthesia light sedation local anesthesia . `` `` A Philips HD 11XE ultrasound machine ( Andover , USA ) transesophageal multiplane echocardiographic probe would use patient . After comprehensive TEE examination probe would position record image either deep TG TGLAX view . Images would record off-line evaluation . A Board certify echocardiographer proficient TEE would perform echocardiographic measurement . Offline echocardiographic measurement would do trained echocardiographer would blind study protocol . All hemodynamic measurement record dedicate research nurse . Experimental protocol : After induction anesthesia initiation hemodynamic monitoring patient would stabilize necessary observe 10-15 min . No intervention would allow period , include fluid administration , change anesthetic concentration manipulation inotropic vasoconstrictor concentration . A period least 5 min stable BP , heart rate , CVP , continuous cardiac output would require obtain baseline set hemodynamic measurement . A passive leg raise ( PLR ) maneuver ( 45 % ) use protocol describe before* literature would perform change hemodynamic echocardiographic parameter would measure within 1 minute post PLR . The sequence PLR echocardiographic hemodynamic measurement would repeat end operation transfer ICU . No measurement would carry presence hemodynamic instability immediately follow change inotropic anesthetic medication . The first set measurement ( HR , MAP , VTI , SV , CO , LVEF LVOT area ) would obtain semi-recumbent position ( 45° ; designate 'baseline ' ) . Then , low limb would lift straight ( 45° ) trunk lower supine position . The second set measurement ( designate 'during PLR ' ) obtain leg elevation , moment VTI plateaued high value . The stroke volume CCO monitor would record moment plateaued high value . NB . Why record change VTI/SV etc . within 1 minute post PLR ? Because maximal hemodynamic effect PLR occur within first minute leg elevation , important ass effect method able track change cardiac output stroke volume real-time basis . ( 5 ) NB . Passive leg raise . The passive leg raise test consist measure hemodynamic effect leg elevation 45° . A simple way perform postural maneuver transfer patient semirecumbent posture passive leg raise position use automatic motion bed .</detailed_description>
