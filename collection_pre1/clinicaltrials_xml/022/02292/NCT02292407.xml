	<detailed_description>Axillary clearance breast cancer usually perform use drain prevent seroma formation support obliteration dead space axillary carry . The hypothesis make protocol axillary clearance use operation technique include use precise LigaSure instrument closure dead space do without use postoperative drain . The AND PRECISE PROTOCOL aim provide first evidence axillary clearance use operation technique include precise LigaSure instrument closure dead space axilla result operation drain necessary need seroma evacuation surgery limit Patients undergo axillary clearance necessary achieve reasonable control invasive breast cancer participate AND PRECISE protocol undergo operation use technique include use precise LigaSure instrument closure dead space . Postoperatively , number seroma punctions amount seroma record prospectively . Patients ask record daily basis experience pain visual analog scale pain . The main study parameter percent case successfully need seroma punctions intervention . Potential disadvantage patient risk seroma formation discomfort . Patients ask record daily basis experience pain visual analog scale pain .</detailed_description>

For pilot , patient undergo breast conserving surgery eligible . Axillary clearance perform previous sentinel node procedure , operation , neoadjuvant chemo therapy , secondary procedure case axillary relapse previous treatment breast cancer . Patients undergo modified radical mastectomy include axillary clearance . Preoperative preexisting seroma .</criteria>
