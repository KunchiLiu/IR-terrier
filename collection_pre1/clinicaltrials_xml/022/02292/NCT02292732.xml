	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , non-randomized , sequential , two-period , repeat-dose study evaluate effect trametinib 2 milligram ( mg ) daily repeat-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) oral contraceptive ( OC ) contain norethindrone ( NE ) ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) ( ORTHO-NOVUM® tablet : 1 mg NE + 0.035 mg EE ) female subject solid tumor . The study determine PK interaction trametinib component combination oral contraceptive would compromise effectiveness contraceptive . The study also evaluate repeat dose PK trametinib metabolite M5 use validated assay . The study enroll approximately 24 subject . Each subject participate study approximately 13 15 week consist 30 day screen period , follow 2 treatment period ( Period 1 : 28 day Period 2 : range 12 day 21 day ) , transition visit post-treatment follow-up visit . In Period 1 , subject take one active tablet ORTHO-NOVUM® tablet 1/35 dial-pack daily approximately time day 21 day ( Days 1 21 ) , follow one inert ( referred placebo ) tablet daily approximately time day 7 day ( Days 22 28 ) . In addition , subject take trametinib 2 mg ( 1 tablet ) daily approximately time day total 17 day ( Days 12 28 ) . In Period 2 , subject take one active tablet ORTHO-NOVUM® tablet 1/35 dial-pack daily approximately time day 11 day ( Days 1 11 ) . In addition , subject continue take trametinib 2 mg ( 1 tablet ) daily approximately time day 11 day ( Days 1 11 ) .
