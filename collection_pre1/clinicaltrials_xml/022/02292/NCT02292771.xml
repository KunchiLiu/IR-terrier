	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate superiority retosiban prolong pregnancy female spontaneous preterm labor compare atosiban . This objective base hypothesis prolong time delivery absence harm may benefit newborn , particularly woman experience spontaneous preterm labor early gestational age ( GA ) . This study design test hypothesis direct comparison atosiban , mixed oxytocin vasopressin antagonist indicated short-term use delay imminent preterm birth woman 24^0/7 33^6/7 week ' gestation preterm labor . This randomized , double-blind , double-dummy study , consist 6 phase : Screening , Inpatient Randomized Treatment , Post Infusion Assessment , Delivery , Maternal Post Delivery Assessment , Neonatal Medical Review . Approximately 330 female randomly assign retosiban atosiban treatment 1:1 ratio . The duration one subject 's ( maternal neonatal ) participation study variable dependent GA study entry date delivery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed date write informed consent require prior subject 's participation study performance protocol specific procedure . Adolescents age 12 17 year must provide write agreement participate study accordance applicable regulatory country state requirement . Subjects also ask sign release medical record time consent allow access maternal neonatal record include information delivery infant care well information collect prior consent sign . Females age 12 45 year , uncomplicated , singleton pregnancy intact membrane preterm labor ( Note : This protocol include pregnant adolescent , age 12 17 year , appropriate , base national local regulations. ) . Gestational age 24^0/7 33^6/7 week determine know fertilization date , either vitro fertilization intrauterine insemination , last menstrual period confirm early ultrasound prior 24^0/7 week ' gestation , early ultrasound alone prior 24^0/7 week ' gestation , whichever accurate method available subject . In situation prenatal ultrasound record available time subject present , investigator make every effort obtain record ( either via computer record , directly subject 's primary care obstetrician , via telephone ) . However , case record readily available ( e.g. , hour , holiday ) , within investigator 's discretion use GA base verbal history subject intent get confirmation medical record soon possible . Subjects must diagnose preterm labor accord follow criterion : Regular uterine contraction rate &gt; =4 contraction least 30 second duration 30minute interval confirm tocodynamometry AND least 1 follow : Cervical dilation &gt; =2 centimeter ( cm ) &lt; =4 cm digital cervical examination If &lt; 2 cm dilation digital cervical examination , cervical change consist increase least 25 % effacement 1 cm dilation Treatment naïve subject subject adequately respond tocolytics atosiban ( e.g. , transfer care unit ) current episode preterm labor may eligible study . Historical failure tocolytic treatment previous episode preterm labor require inclusion criterion . Tocolytic failure define progressive cervical change continue uterine contraction . Fever temperature great 100.4°fahrenheit ( F ) ( 38°Celcius [ C ] ) 1 hour &gt; =101°F ( 38.3°C ) 24 hour prior start study treatment . Women maternalfetal condition potentially necessitate need delivery , preeclampsia fetal compromise A fetus diagnosis , condition , treatment , factor opinion investigator potential affect confound assessment efficacy safety ( e.g. , nonreassuring fetal status , intrauterine growth restriction , major congenital anomaly ) . Preterm premature rupture membrane Women confirm suspected contraindication prolongation pregnancy , placental abruption , chorioamnionitis , placenta previa Evidence polyhydramnios ( amniotic fluid index [ AFI ] &gt; 25 cm ) oligohydramnios ( AFI &lt; 5 cm ) . Women comorbid medical obstetric condition opinion investigator potential complicate pregnancy course outcome , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes ( know , history glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 8 % time pregnancy ) , compromise safety subject , underlie cardiovascular disorder ( specifically ischemic cardiac disease , congenital heart disease , pulmonary hypertension , valvular heart disease , arrhythmia , cardiomyopathy ) . Women history substance abuse urine drug screen finding suggestive substance abuse may either implicate cause preterm labor ( e.g. , abuse cocaine methamphetamine ) potential complicate pregnancy outcome ( e.g. , alcohol abuse opioid addiction ) . Women diagnosis , condition , treatment , factor opinion investigator potential affect confound assessment efficacy safety . Women document active hepatitis B hepatitis C viral infection , unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , esophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History sensitivity IPs component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) /PPD medical monitor , contraindicate participation .</criteria>
