	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes associated respiratory muscle weakness autonomic neuropathy . The exercise inspiratory muscle investigate various clinical situation may cause similar benefit conventional exercise . The assessment glucose variability use alternative tool evaluate others mechanisms absolute value glucose level , special exercise . However , effect inspiratory muscle exercise glucose level glucose variability clear yet . The aim propose research evaluate acute effect inspiratory muscle exercise use high load 60 % MIP glucose level glucose variability patient type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-intensity exercise inspiratory muscle able reduce glucose level previous study , mechanism underlie reduction remain largely unknown . The present study investigate phenomenon , whether confirm , inspiratory muscle load would new approach lower glucose level glucose variability type 2 diabetes . The subject type 2 diabetes recruit ambulatory Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre . The patient randomize inspiratory muscle exercise high intensity load ( MIP 60 % ) exercise load placebo ( MIP 2 % ) , two different day . The subject come laboratory three day consecutively 2 week . On first day place CGMS device . On second day control ventilation protocol subsequently inspiratory muscle exercise , use 2 % 60 % MIP randomize priori . On third day CGMS remove . Individuals use beta-blockers advise withdraw medication 24 hour protocol . During protocol record continuous blood pressure assess heart rate blood pressure variability , time frequency domain analyze . Also , calf blood flow , inspiratory pressure , end-tidal carbon dioxide oxygen saturation taking .</detailed_description>
