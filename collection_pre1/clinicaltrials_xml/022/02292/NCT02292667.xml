	<brief_summary>The ETAP study aim assess effect addition ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block multimodal intravenous analgesia protocol postoperative pain control open surgical repair abdominal aortic aneurysm . The ETAP study single-center open-label randomize controlled trial . Half patient include receive association TAP block multimodal intravenous analgesia , half receive multimodal intravenous analgesia alone . The multimodal intravenous analgesia include intravenous paracetamol intravenous patient-controlled analgesia morphine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Open Aortic Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open repair abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) painful surgery . Patients suffer AAA high risk perioperative cardiovascular pulmonary complication . It previously suggest bad perioperative pain control could increase incidence complication . Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) morphine widely consider gold standard treatment postoperative pain open repair AAA . High dose morphine often require could delay postoperative recovery discharge . Side effect morphine , respiratory depression , nausea , vomit pruritus , responsible patient discomfort dissatisfaction high dos use . The efficacy ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block describe pain management follow abdominal surgery , gastrectomy kidney transplantation . The efficacy association TAP block PCA morphine high multimodal intravenous analgesia include PCA morphine combination PCA morphine epidural analgesia . To knowledge , efficacy ultrasound-guided TAP block never study postoperative pain control AAA surgery .</detailed_description>
