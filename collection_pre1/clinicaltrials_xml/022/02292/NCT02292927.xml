	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND Prehabilitation use sport military avoid injury evidence surgical literature physical prehabilitation improve patient fitness major procedure . It already use great effect within orthopaedics ; joint replacement patient participate strength-based training aerobic flexibility exercise six week pre-operatively reduce odds require inpatient rehabilitation 73 % [ 1 ] . In surgical specialty , prehabilitation also show improve pre-operative physical function [ 2,3 ] . In pre-post intervention study , although postoperative complication rate hospital length stay similar , significant improvement post-operative walking capacity . At 8 week , 81 % prehabilitated patient recover compare 40 % pre-intervention group [ 4 ] . In contrast , randomise control trial [ 5 ] show difference control intervention group prehabilitation introduce . The author claim may due fact walk deep breathing exercise ( give control group ) effective alone , may also differences small cohort ; patient fit compare population patient aneurysm disease . The literature surround prehabilitation concept largely bias towards use exercise alone . Rather purely physical assessment pre-operative training , think afford wider impact major surgery patient undergo major surgery . For example , strong evidence suggest undergoing major surgery significant implication patient ' post-operative psychological wellbeing . Qualitative data suggest patient experience significant loss confidence feeling anxiety aftermath major cardiac surgery due feel unable task activity previously undertake [ 6 ] . Psychological distress could delay patient ' recovery increase level stress link delayed recovery surgery [ 7 ] . Psycho-educational support surgical patient significant benefit psychological clinical outcome [ 8-10 ] . Interventions vary include element supply information , cognitive coping strategy , relaxation , reassurance support , rehearsal , prepare patient tackle rigorous effort need recover major surgery . Lastly , number psycho-social intervention target specific health behaviour would obviously benefit recovery patient . The commonly know widely study health behaviour intervention significant benefit smoking cessation . Giving smoke 6 week surgery decrease post-operative complication rate 50 % . Whilst effect give smoking well know , effort curtail need nicotine often ignore , perhaps lack knowledge within medical discipline [ 11 ] . Proposed intervention - The introduction biopsychosocial intervention surgery . The physical exercise programme prescribe exercise training twice per week support physical therapist vascular nurse specialist . A trained clinical psychologist also deliver brief psychological intervention base cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) techniques two session modify illness , surgical preparation rehabilitation belief . Lastly patient counsel referred smoking cessation service appropriate vascular nurse specialist . Baseline information include patient demographic medical history , quality life assessment use SF-36 form , hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) exercise test standardise 6-minute walk test Information immediately pre-operatively collect include repeat assessment physical function 6-minute walk test , SF-36 assessment HADS score . Smoking cessation rate collect . A pre post-intervention group study 1-year period . We report eligibility , acceptability pre-operative effect trimodal rehabilitation programme . 2 . AIM AND EXPECTED IMPACT This non-randomised pre-post intervention pilot study understand acceptability pre-operative effect combine physical , psychological social prehabilitation package patient undergoing aneurysm repair . This enable design ( feasibility power ) large scale Randomised Controlled Trial . Our hypothesis include : - The introduction prehabilitation programme acceptable majority patient undergo aneurysm surgery - A physical pre-operative exercise programme increase physical fitness surgery - A psychological intervention base cognitive behaviour therapy technique reduce anxiety surgery prepare patient well post-operative recovery - The introduction psycho-social counsel smoke cessation encourage patient give smoke pre-operatively 3 . PARTICIPANT ENTRY : PATIENTS 3.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS The research team identify eligible patient recruitment study via clinic list , multidisciplinary meeting referral letter patient attends clinic appointment . Only adult patient undergo aortic surgery select . Patient information leaflet give select patient patient give opportunity read ask question decide whether participate . 3.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA - Adult patient ( &gt; 18 year old ) undergo aortic aneurysm repair . - Ability comprehend retain instruction regard self-training - Physical fitness allow participation exercise programme . 3.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Minors ( &lt; 18 year old ) - Adult patient capacity consent . - Emergency urgent procedure necessary 6 week lead time operation . 3.4 WITHDRAWRAL CRITERIA The patient make aware may withdraw study time without provide reason ; care treatment affect . 4 . STUDY DESIGN The acceptability programme study pre-operative impact functional capacity assess comparator ( pre-intervention ) post-intervention group . Patients Patients Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Vascular Unit undergoing aortic aneurysm repair recruit . The unit perform region 100 abdominal aortic repair annually 100 thoracic aneurysm . Inclusion criteria patient undergo elective repair , willing/able undertake period prehabilitation , able comprehend retain instruction regard self-training . Symptomatic patient undergoing urgent treatment ( &lt; 2 week ) exclude decline participate . Deliberately broad inclusion exclusion criterion choose fully understand proportion patient may benefit intervention . Allowing 25 % ineligibility include 25 % refuse enter study would allow 50 patient recruit provide vital information acceptability potential intervention . All patient undergo aneurysm repair type reason inclusion exclusion study record enable comprehensive evaluation number patient potentially suitable prehabilitation programme . We plan identify potential patient vascular outpatient clinic initial point referral work-up nurse lead service . A standardised screening assessment sheet use . At point give patient information leaflet regard study ( pre post intervention group ) . On day standard pre-assessment give patient information leaflet , agree study , consent . Patients consent chance ask unanswered question . If patient agrees participate , ask sign consent form , keep securely locked office . Those agree participate study receive additional appointment day vascular nurse specialist baseline measurement target instruction Bio Psycho Social Prehabilitation Programme . It anticipate would take two hour addition standard appointment . Study Protocol Our current vascular pre-operative assessment service establish nurse lead service , run dedicate aortic clinical nurse specialist . The prehabilitation would run conjunction current pre-operative screening measure currently place - include dobutamine stress echocardiography , renal assessment pulmonary function test . -Phase 1 - Comparator ( pre-intervention ) evaluation Patients undergoing present standard care - i.e . standard work-up aneurysm repair without nurse-led prehabilitation strategy , meet inclusion exclusion criterion give patient information leaflet , inform pre-intervention group consent inclusion study detail . At baseline appointment , day work-up test , information collect standardise data collection sheet include : - Patient demographic medical history - Baseline Quality Life assessment use SF-36 form - Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) . - Exercise test standardise 6-minute walk test - Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) Information immediately pre-operatively collected day operation ( standard admission day ) include repeat assessment physical function 6-minute walk test , Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) , SF-36 assessment HADS score . Smoking cessation rate pre-operative period collect . The aneurysm repair proceed standard care , unchanged standard practice . -Phase 2 - Intervention Proposed intervention - The introduction biopsychosocial intervention surgery . The physical exercise programme prescribe exercise training twice per week support vascular nurse specialist , previously show small effect length stay cardiac patient [ 12 ] . A trained specialist ( registered psychologist ) also deliver brief psychological intervention base cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) techniques two session modify illness , surgical preparation rehabilitation belief . This psychological intervention show effective encouraging claudicants initiate continue exercise training [ 13 ] . Lastly patient counsel referred smoking cessation service appropriate . Phase 2 protocol - During initial set-up phase comprehensive information booklet develop instruct patient three mode prehabilitation . Patients eligible study approach way patient study comparator group . At baseline study visit , baseline information collect comparator group i.e . : At baseline appointment , day work-up test , information collect standardise data collection sheet include : - Patient demographic medical history - Baseline Quality Life assessment use SF-36 form - Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) . - Exercise test standardise 6-minute walk test - Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) In addition patient receive : - Information booklet - Physical exercise plan , run-through explanation . - Psychological therapy day mutually convenient day patient therapist . - Counselling nurse specialist referral smoking cessation Patients receive telephone follow-up nurse specialist week 2 week 4 evaluate progress encourage compliance programme . Between week 5-6 patient session clinical psychologist , prior admission treatment , prepare impend hospitalisation . Again , information immediately pre-operatively collect include repeat assessment physical function 6-minute walk test , Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) , SF-36 assessment HADS score . In addition , patient ask fill questionnaire assess compliance acceptability prehabilitation programme . Smoking cessation rate collect . 5 . Data Collection The following demographic data record standardise data collection form patient , collect patient record patient interview : - Inclusion exclusion criterion - Medical history/risk factor - ASA classification - Planned operative procedure detail - Physical status use functional capacity , measure metabolic equivalent ( METs ) , Duke Activity Status Index ( score less 4 indicate poor physical function ) . Functional capacity may usually express metabolic equivalent ( METs ) , one MET define oxygen consumption 70-kg man rest . Greater 7 METs activity tolerance consider excellent , whereas less 4 METs consider poor activity tolerance . The Duke Activity Status Index suggest question correlate MET level ; example , walk level ground 4 mile per hour carry bag grocery flight stair expend approximately 4 METs activity . This system use Cleveland clinic pre-operative cardiac evaluation . It allow pre-operative assessment physical function ass predict ability cope home surgery . A brief , self-completed questionnaire ( Appendix 1 ) provide standardized assessment functional status correlate well objective measure maximal exercise capacity [ 14 ] . Post-operative data collect patient order plan study base reduce length stay . - Inpatient complication : grade detail use standardise data collection sheet - Length stay - HDU/ITU use - Mortality At base line visit prior operation patient assess use : - Baseline Quality Life assessment use SF-36 form - Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) . - Exercise test standardise 6-minute walk test - Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) An event log record patient throughout study period . Patients undergo intervention ask complete short questionnaire compliance acceptability prehabilitation programme . 6 . ANALYSIS Completed data collection sheet analyse omission miss data complete log onto central database analyse research team Imperial College , London , St. Mary 's Campus . The two group compare use simple statistical method . We intend analyse report follow - The number patient accepted inclusion pre-operative prehabilitation programme calculate . - The change physical fitness patient ( assessed physical function section SF-36 measure peak flow/6-minute walk test ) pre-operative phase assess pre post-intervention group . - The effect quality life . - The effect programme anxiety depression study participant assess . - The number patient able reduce cease smoking report . - Compliance acceptability prehabilitation programme . - Morbidity Mortality , HDU/ITU resource use well Length hospital stay aortic surgery .
