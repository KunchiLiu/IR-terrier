	<brief_summary>This prospective single center trial investigate effect prospectively measure pack density prior choose Target Coils treatment intracranial saccular aneurysm . Up 25 eligible subject rupture unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysm 4-20mm ( maximum dimension ) , consent study participation , treat Stryker Target Detachable Coils . Historical data patient enrol MAPS trial single center control arm trial review comparison prospective arm . In control arm , subject receive Stryker Matrix2 Detachable Coils Guglielmi Detachable Coils pack density measure prior procedure . The Pro-Pack Trial evaluate outcome subject treat Target Coils , pack density actively calculate prior coil selection . This serve establish high pack density obtain change methodology coil selection high pack density low recurrence rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Packing Density With Target Coils I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pro Pack Trial evaluate outcome subject treat Target Coils , pack density actively calculate prior coil selection . Selecting coil best volumetric fill show increase overall packing density . Each coil thereafter evaluate prior placement ass resultant pack density . An initial goal 10 % great pack density first coil use guide coil selection . A final packing density great 25 % attempt feasible . Currently , maximum pack density define . While theoretically pack density may approach 100 % , reality space coil loop occupy large percentage coil mass , pack density rarely reach 50 % great . As , final packing density leave operator , base ability place coil safely operator . Potential subject screen , consent , image , evaluate order obtain 25 patient complete 12-month follow-up . Baseline patient data collect time procedure ; follow-up information collect within 48 hour procedure , approximately 12 month ( ±3 month ) procedure . The anticipated study duration approximately 24 month : 12 month recruitment , 12 month primary endpoint closeout . Enrollment study occur sign Informed Consent form obtain , eligibility criterion meet , aneurysm volume calculate , procedure place Target Coils prospective density measurement begin , i.e. , time target procedural angiography . From moment placement first coil , patient consider study whether receive Target Coils , follow include final analysis . Patients enrol trial follow approximately 12 month index embolization procedure . This allow evaluation primary secondary study endpoint . Targeted enrollment 25 patient complete 12 month follow-up evaluation . Every effort make follow progress monitor safety patient treat Target® Coils . Embolization utilize Target® Coils may proceed time diagnostic angiography eligible patient sign Informed Consent form . The investigator must perform embolization procedure . Framing , filling , finish do Target Coils . In event aneurysm wide neck unfavorable anatomy , adjunctive therapy , Neuroform Stent may use ensure best clinical angiographic result . The site enter ongoing , real time information electronic imaging database track outcomes follow-up angiographic evaluation . The degree occlusion , coil and/or thrombus , measure post procedurally 12 +/- 3 month post procedure Angiographic Core Laboratory use 3 point categorical scale : complete , residual neck/dog ear residual aneurysm . Additionally , final angiogram , same/ good / bad scale shall apply .</detailed_description>
