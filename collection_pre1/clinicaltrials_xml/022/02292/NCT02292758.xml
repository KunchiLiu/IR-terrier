	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well irinotecan cetuximab without bevacizumab work treat patient RAS wild-type colorectal cancer spread place body remove surgery . Irinotecan may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving irinotecan cetuximab without bevacizumab may work bet treat patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Cetuximab With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With RAS Wild-Type Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive irinotecan , cetuximab , bevacizumab patient receive irinotecan , cetuximab placebo , population patient RAS wild-type , irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) also previously receive bevacizumab least one prior line therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess adverse event ( AE ) profile safety propose treatment population . II . To assess compare overall survival ( OS ) treatment arm population . III . To assess compare disease control rate ( DCR ) treatment arm population . IV . To assess compare overall response rate ( ORR ) treatment arm population . V. To assess compare duration response treatment arm population . VI . To assess compare time treatment failure treatment arm population . VII . To assess relative dose intensity treatment agent treatment arm population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine change genotype concentration prespecified gene mutation circulate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( cfDNA ) collect serially protocol treatment . II . Explore predictive value pretreatment mutation status cetuximab sensitivity resistance . III . Explore predictive value dynamic change mutation status cetuximab sensitivity resistance . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 90-120 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cetuximab IV 90-120 minute , placebo IV 30-90 minute , irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
