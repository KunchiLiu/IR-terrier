	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) affect ~90,000 people U.S. suffer significant neurological , lung , kidney damage , well severe chronic pain episode adversely impact quality life . While current medical therapy SCD reduce short-term morbidity , inevitable progressive deterioration organ function result significant decrease quality health early mortality . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) benefit patient SCD , provide source life-long production normal red blood cell . However , allogeneic HSCT limit availability well-matched donor immunological complication , especially 80 % patient lack HLA-identical sibling donor . Autologous HSCT use patient 's bone marrow stem cell correct transfer modify human beta-globin gene inhibits polymerization HbS ( stem cell gene therapy ) may provide good therapeutic alternative , would avoid immunologic complication donor limitation allogeneic HSCT . Up 6 subject SCD lack match sibling donor meet eligibility criterion disease severity adequacy organ function enrol . Following informed consent , enrolled subject screen confirm full eligibility participation . Eligible subject undergo bone marrow harvest ( portion cryopreserved `` back-up '' ) remain portion marrow use prepare gene-modified Final Cellular Product : autologous bone marrow CD34+ cell transduce ex vivo Lenti/βAS3-FB lentiviral vector express anti-sickling ( βAS3 ) gene . The subject receive marrow cytoreduction busulfan prior infusion gene-modified cell . The follow-up period include initial 2 year active end-point evaluation , subject see interval 3 month , follow offer enrollment long-term follow-up study year 3-15 . The primary objective Phase I study assess safety feasibility , secondary objective assess efficacy ( engraftment , βAS3-globin gene expression , effect RBC function clinical hematologic disease parameter ) .</detailed_description>

Or medical decision therapy ( e.g . chronic transfusion program ) , subject refusal take HU . The patient must HU least 90 day ( +/ 5 day ) enrol trial . Must one follow clinical complication demonstrate disease severity : Clinicallysignificant neurologic event : stroke central nervous system deficit last &gt; 24 hour . Abnormal head CT brain MRI demonstrate previous stroke Administration regular RBC transfusion equal longer 1 year prevent vasoocclusive crisis sickle cell disease complication maintain Hb &gt; 6 . Pulmonary arterial hypertension tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity &gt; 2.5 m/sec . At least one episode acute chest syndrome require hospitalization , intubation , mechanical ventilation support within 2 year prior enrollment At least 2 acute sickle pain crisis require hospitalization within 2 year prior enrollment Osteonecrosis require joint replacement History acute dactylitis childhood Recurrent priapism ( 2 episode ) Karnofsky performance score ≥60 % Patient medically eligible available HLAidentical sibling donor 10/10 allelematched unrelated donor ( least 3 month search ) Cardiac evaluation : leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % LV shorten fraction &lt; 26 % cardiac echocardiogram MUGA scan , Poorlycontrolled hypertension determine history record BP previous year systolic &gt; 135 diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg .

( Potential subject serum ferritin &gt; 1,000 refer back physician specific evaluation { e.g . MRI liver biopsy } , consideration iron chelation therapy , indicate .
