	<brief_summary>The study aim : Using Intervention map plan approach behavior change intervention program , base ecological approach health local community user participation . - Explore behavioral change process utilizing qualitative method . - Develop theory-based behavior change program across different domain healthy living centre . - Evaluate effect behavior change intervention program across different domain . - Increase health provider ` competence effective behavioral change intervention technique network education seminar municipality research group . - The program specifically target underlying cause chronic disease . The investigator map distribution lifestyle habit among individual family . The investigator also explore lifestyle habit relate know determinant social health inequality , adverse previous experience , participation work life low income . - The investigator also intend study socioeconomic difference importance enter drop HLC intervention , ability sustain lifestyle change .

	<detailed_description>Approaches , hypothesis choice method A multidisciplinary team researcher work realize project accord systematic stepwise approach combine use PRECEDE-PROCEED model Intervention Mapping ( IM ) protocol . The PRECEDE-PROCEED model conceptual model serve need current project educational ecological approach health program planning . IM use plan approach develop theory- evidence base health promote intervention program . Following IM process , map path needs assessment , development program objective , selection intervention method strategy , program design . A benefit IM linkage community-based participatory research include engagement community member identify refine priority area . Thus , process include IM develop intervention program secure users staff healthy living centre significant autonomy may influence development intervention programme , tailor intervention fit local need . In initial step IM process explore research field utilize qualitative research method . The investigator use focus group in-depth interview obtain sufficient information tailor intervention local need resource . The investigator intend explore expectation staff user HLCs different intervention programme , perceive attendance . The research program Self Determination Theory ( SDT ) theoretical point departure overall theoretical framework qualitative study RCTs behavioral intervention program across different behavioural domain . Even though logic model understanding behavioral change linear , focus presume cause-effect identified theory empirical research , investigator acknowledge behavioral treatment program propose outcome part complex multilevel system ( ecological approach ) ( Bartholomew et al.2011 ) . An ecological way analyze health problem solution support use variety theory develop program , oppose one single theory . Theories help describe at-risk group environmental agent , understand health-promotion behavior environmental agent , understand heath-promotion behavior , find method promote change ( Bartholomew , 2011 ) . The 0-hypothesis controlled study different behavioral treatment program effect compare control . Alternative research hypothesis : - Participants perceive interpersonal health care-climate autonomy supportive , report autonomous reason attend program follow ` guideline ( self-determined ) . - The program predict increase autonomous motivation behavioral change , perceive self-efficacy program construct : e.g . physical exercise , healthy eating , quality life . - The program improve participant ' health behavior . - The program improve participant ' self-perceived health risk factor non-communicable disease . The investigator also measure effect health behaviour health ordinary practice municipality , study effect systemic organisational intervention . This benefit external validity research project .</detailed_description>
