	<brief_title>Plasma microRNA Profiling First Line Screening Test Lung Cancer Detection : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three decade research show radiological screen heavy smoker detect resectable early lung cancer higher frequency benefit mortality still debate . The preliminary result first two randomized spiral-CT screening trial appear conflict , one study show benefit limited mortality reduction ( -7 % ) . In next 3-4 year ongoing randomised trial Europe provide conclusive data efficacy CT-screening lung cancer . Nonetheless , major impact mortality expect . A possible explanation find aggressive lung tumor arise identifiable slow-growing precursor , thus suggest possible paradigm shift understand natural history lung cancer . In respect identification biologic molecular feature indolent aggressive disease could useful define clinical predictor high risk lesion select suitable cohort patient might benefit current treatment well identify genetic signature might represent novel therapeutic target . The investigator recently report microRNA ( miRNA ) expression expression profile tumor , first time , also normal lung tissue indicative aggressive lung cancer development , remarkable interest , specific miRNA signature identify plasma sample patient two year spiral-CT detection disease , able identify occurrence early metastatic spiral-CT invisible lung tumor small spiral-CT detected lesion aggressive potential . In present project propose large prospective study heavy smoker volunteer base plasma miRNA profile ass efficacy first line screen test lung cancer detection . The study articulate different phase : ) analysis 1000 plasma sample disease-free smoker already collect biological repository last two year ii ) de-novo enrollment 4000 smoking volunteer , collection blood sample inclusion program active surveillance basis miRNA risk profile iii ) assessment miRNA expression profile use custom make microfluidic card contain 24 miRNA previously identify diagnostic signature iii ) bioinformatic analysis miRNA ratio cohort order determine individual presence develop lung cancer particular aggressive form disease iv ) assessment best diagnostic treatment algorithm subject suspicious miRNA profile v ) functional validation miRNAs novel therapeutic target use novel cellular genetically engineer model transformation patient ' tumorgrafts model . Overall , result large prospective study permit establish potential plasma microRNA assay first-line screening test lung cancer detection routine clinical practice high-risk population screen low cost , non toxic non invasive procedure . Moreover , related functional study foresee project could lead identification novel , miRNA target , therapeutic approach malignancy .</detailed_description>
