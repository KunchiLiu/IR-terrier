	<brief_title>Effectiveness Aquatic Physical Therapy Knee Osteoarthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patient recruit clinic print newspaper . Physicians routinely evaluate patient diagnosis inform study , announce television call . After pass medical examination confirm clinical diagnosis knee osteoarthritis American College Rheumatology criterion , elect inform objective study invited participate . After evaluation record referral knee OA , patient receive phone call , inform research objective , question regard inclusion exclusion criterion study invite participate study . Upon study entry , personal information ( name , age , gender , address telephone ) confirm secretary , give registration number patient . Personal information , well radiograph , keep personal form , number study enrollment . Before implementation treatment protocol , well three month , patient assess independent examiner , ie , knowledge intervention respect different variable . The independent examiner previously train role become fit . Individuals assess use rubric outcome pain intensity use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) ; functional capacity Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index ( WOMAC ) ; balance Activities-specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) static posturography reaction force grind static force platform . Body weight check portable scale ; height , waist circumference tape measure calculate BMI . After evaluation , patient divide number generate computer site ( www.random.org ) treatment group 30 patient . After generation number , transform card assign treatment ( 1- Patient Education ; 2 Aquatic Physiotherapy ) place seal , opaque , sequentially numbered envelope . Thus , prevent evaluator therapist choose group patient assign . Procedures randomization allocation , well assessment intervention blind . The educational program comprise multidisciplinary team : doctor , pharmacist , nurse , nutritionist , psychologist , physiotherapist physical educator . Classes weekly group eight week , last two hour , hold Parlor Our Lady Grace Church , belong scope Health Unit Vila Brazil . The program include education , follow suggestion Coleman et al . follow item : guideline disease complication , strategy pain management ( pharmacological cognitive ) , physical exercise , nutrition weight control , medication ( type , interaction , current trend , side effect ) , balance , proprioception , fall prevention , cop chronic pain . Following , practical activity theme address . To enhance information end , patient receive print material guideline give professional . Still , first last day education program , patient respond questionnaire address knowledge disease develop researcher . Supervised aquatic exercise run individually , twice week , last 60 minute , eight week , total 16 session Center Aquatic Physical Therapy Professor Paulo Armindo Seibert , Universidade Estadual de Londrina . The water temperature maintain approximately 32 degree , depth 1.20m . The exercise protocol consist : five minute heat walk patellar mobilization ; ten minute stretch muscle low limb ( quadriceps , gluteus , adductor abductor hip sural triceps hamstring ) ; ten minute isometric dynamic exercise elastic ( quadriceps , gluteus , adductor abductor hip sural triceps hamstring ) ; twenty minute away aerobic exercise ( stationary run deep water run ) ; ten minute functional train step proprioceptive exercise ; five minute cool stretch muscle low limb ( quadriceps , gluteus , adductor abductor hip sural triceps hamstring ) . Both group receive guidance home exercise two three time week , reinforce familiar previously illustrate booklet , include goal aquatic exercise : heating , self stretch low limb muscle , isometric dynamic exercise low limb , proprioceptive functional exercise , aerobic exercise relaxation . Three month end intervention protocol , ie , end follow-up , patient group Education invite perform aquatic therapy patient group aquatic therapy receive manual educational guideline .</detailed_description>
