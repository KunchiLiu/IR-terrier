	<brief_summary>The study shall investigate whether isomaltulose - digest absorbed comparable degree like carbohydrate ( CHO ) use ingredient age group ( e.g . sucrose ) , measure H2 exhalation postprandial period - mediate abdominal discomfort diarrhoea therefore well tolerate CHO ( e.g . sucrose ) , by/in healthy infant age 6 12 month . It hypothesize isomaltulose , provided standard follow-on formula , 1. significantly increase mean basal breath H2-excretion rate ( determine incremental area curve ( iAUC ) H2-exhalation ) 3 h postprandial period compare sucrose contain standard follow-on formula . 2. lead significantly different gastrointestinal tolerance conse-quent 24 h formula consumption compare sucrose contain standard follow-on formula infant age 6 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention schedule Study Day 1 Study Day 2 . The caretaker ask feed infant usual standard formula morning Study Day 1 Study Day 2 home ( regular feeding time ) . At study center , infant consume usual follow-up formula usual amount wich study product ( palatinose sucrose 1 gram/kg body weight ) add near 0.5 kg weight . The introduction second meal day time first feed interventionwill 4h . Before single consumption study formula ( baseline vs. test condition ) , H2 exhalation infant measure monitor every 30 min additional period 3 h. In Study Days 1 2 , wash-out period least 2 day implement reduce potential occurrence carry-over effect .</detailed_description>
