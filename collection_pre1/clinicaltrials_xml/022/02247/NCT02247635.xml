	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome group cardiometabolic risk factor reflect sedentary lifestyle excessive intake food among risk factor comprise locate obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia hypertension . It observe intervention lifestyle change promote weight loss practice physical activity intake hypocaloric diet , reduce prevalence chronic diseases Metabolic syndrome . Adherence define extent person 's behaviour - take medication , follow diet , and/or execute lifestyle change , corresponds agree recommendation health care provider . The World Health Organization estimate develop country , Mexico , less 27 % people chronic disease continue treatment direct . Adherence treatment chronic disease multifactorial problem include patient-related barrier , also providers health service social security system . Furthermore , WHO point , increase prevalence chronic non-adherence treatment become global problem even serious . The purpose study develop implement methodology overcome barrier affect adherence treatment woman 20 year non-communicable disease metabolic syndrome ( diabetes , hypertension dyslipidemia ) evaluate impact various quantitative indicator weight loss metabolic syndrome prevalence . This study include two phase : 1 . Phase 1 . Design . Qualitative methodology use primarily identify barrier face individual adhere treatment . From methodology , develop tool ass adherence treatment subject condition intervention improve . 2 . Phase 2 . Implementation intervention ( 24 week ) . To recruite group 180 overweight two follow comorbidities : diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia hypertension . All study subject randomize control group intervention . The control group receive medical traditional clinical care .

	<brief_title>Effect Treatment Lifestyle Changes Prevalence Metabolic Syndrome Body Weight Mexican Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate worldwide one billion adult overweight . In Mexico , prevalence overweight obesity use data 2006 nearly 70 % men woman 20 year . Being overweight associate co-morbidities diabetes mellitus ( 79.4 % ) , hypertension ( 78.0 % ) dyslipidemia ( 82.8 % ) . WHO estimate 50 % patient poor grip follow treatment indicate , generate cost manage disease $ 100 billion year . Improve effectiveness intervention adherence treatment , significantly improve health patient help reduce cost involve health system . The obesity comorbidities affect 41 % adult Mexico increase five time risk develop cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes three time risk develop coronary artery disease myocardial infarction . Therefore , diseases currently one main problem public health Mexico . Adherence short long term result complex process develop different stage : acceptance diagnosis , perceive need treatment successfully , motivation , skill train available , ability overcome barrier difficulty arise , maintenance achievement time . The lack adherence chronic disease multifactorial problem include patient-related barrier , also service provider health system . Poor adherence long-term therapy severely compromise effectiveness treatment negatively impact quality life patient . It observe intervention lifestyle change promote weight loss practice physical activity intake hypocaloric diet , reduce prevalence Metabolic diseases achieve good control . The change lifestyle foundation strategy treatment chronical disease . The patient require counseling effect change behavior improve risk mortality morbidity . So far , intervention improve treatment patient chronic disease , include diet exercise recommendation , report significant positive change . Moreover , Mexico still method reference tool ass adherence . It report healthy lifestyle achieve positive change cardiovascular risk factor , however , know methodology help patient overcome barrier prevent adopt adhere recommendation prescribe provider health service . Therefore , objective study assess multidisciplinary treatment stimulates constant practice physical activity intake hypocaloric diet , reduce prevalence metabolic chronic disease obesity , diabetes , hypertension dyslipidemia , improve control , comparison traditional medical treatment Mexican woman . Also , develop methodology validate Mexican population identify barrier affect adherence treatment assess impact variety quantitative indicator health . This project conduct 2 phase . PHASE 1 Development tool identify barrier . In private hospital care chronic noncommunicable disease , call patient co-morbidities associated overweight obesity ( diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension ) identify common barrier face adequately follow treatment application validate questionnaire . The result use reference discussion traditional treatment algorithm base Mexican standard management obesity , hypertension , diabetes dyslipidemia . PHASE 2 . Design implementation intervention Phase 2 begin recruitment study subject . The recruitment do local advertising campaign include poster leaflet city Cuernavaca , Morelos . México . Were recruit group 180 patient overweight two follow co-morbidities : diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia hypertension . All study subject randomize control group intervention . The intervention last 24 week . The control group receive traditional clinical care intervention group receive behavioral intervention improve adherence . The design intervention base stages-of-change model ( also refer transtheoretical model ) identify five stage individual progress change behaviour , stage-matched strategy predict progress subsequent stage change . The stage change : Precontemplation stage subject plan make effort adhere treatment change behavior . ( Not consider change behavior next 6 month ) , The second call `` contemplation '' , person admits risk behavior beneficial begin think try change adopt . ( Considering change behavior next 6 month ) , The third `` preparation '' stage person intend initiate behavior change , strategy plan acquire solution . ( Planning change behavior next 30 day ) , The fourth `` action '' become person intend expect action ( study action improve adherence treatment ) . ( Currently change behavior ) The fifth `` maintenance '' , change establish usual . ( Successful behavior change least 6 month ) . There sixth stage call `` relapse '' , person return behavior change , abandon effort go pre-action stage . Stages change describe individual 's motivational readiness change . The specific tool contain intervention program : Preparation At stage various strategy develop : - Educational text - Individual medical advice - Written contract engagement The objective stage make individual reflect health . Action At stage individual begin proper action get good adherence It provide enough print material allows achieve goal diet , physical activity take medication . There computerized database ( software ) update progress barrier present individual able access either nutritionist doctor psychologist Description tool : - Educational text . Based feedback patient doctor , nutritionist psychologist expert , design brochure educational leaflet practical advice achieve intermediate goal end treatment . - Consultation personalize feedback Develop scheme service provider ( doctor , nutritionist psychologist ) provide attention individual , query adjust level adherence achieve . In query use reference treatment guideline ADA Third Adult Treatment Panel ( ATP III ) . - Nutrition . The consultation give nutritionist trained give dietary treatment base available activity time patient . - Physical activity . The type activity design expert field prescribe nutritionist take account patient 's age ability . Data collection do different tool accord phase project Phase 1 : ) Identification barrier treatment application validate questionnaire . Phase 2 : 1 . Identification socioeconomic data application two questionnaire . 2 . Anthropometry : weight scale Tanita model BC-418 . Height stadiometer SECA , model 220 . Waist ribbon flexible glass fiber 0.5 cm width precision 1 mm . 3 . The measurement intima-media thickness carotid make Ultrasound SONOSITE PLUS model 180 . 4 . Collection biological sample determination biochemical parameter like glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol triglyceride . Variables Dependent . The dependent variable outcome reduction prevalence obesity comorbidities ( hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia ) , control measure weight loss , decrease blood pressure , fast glucose , cholesterol . Independent . The independent variable lifestyle behavioral program . Data Analysis . Will present descriptive statistic dependent variable weight , fast glucose , HbA1c , triglyceride , HDL-C , LDL-C , blood pressure intima-media thickness . Each group analyze mean difference measurement time ( initial , intermediate final ) mean difference test The difference control intervention group analyze use three strategy : 1 ) intention treat ( include patient drop ) , 2 ) full support intervention ( patient complete program ) , 3 ) proper administration intervention , ie analysis specific subject receive intervention effectively physician nutritionist ( patient intervene correctly ) .</detailed_description>
