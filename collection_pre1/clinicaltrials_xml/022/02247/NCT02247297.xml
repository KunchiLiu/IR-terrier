	<brief_title>Pancreatic Stone Protein ( PSP ) Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman feature complex immunological condition cause pregnancy hence woman present increased susceptibility infectious non-infectious inflammatory disease . Specifically regulated mechanism describe occur normal whereas lack pathological pregnancy native adaptive immune system animal model human . However , clinically relevant biomarker associate preterm premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) , amniotic infection syndrome ( AIS ) well pregnancy associate complication preeclampsia hemolysis , elevate liver enzyme , low platelet ( HELLP ) syndrome limitation . Pancreatic stone protein ( PSP ) , originally obtain human pancreatic stone patient operate chronic calcifying pancreatitis , study several gastrointestinal pathology . The aim study evaluate physiological course potentially novel biomarker PSP pregnant woman well assess predictive role development inflammatory complication pregnancy .</detailed_description>
