	<detailed_description>Original proposal : Does iatrogenic chronotropic incompetence lead impair exercise capacity patient CHF Aim The aim proposal examine effect iatrogenic CI exercise capacity control subject patient chronic heart failure . Hypothesis Iatrogenic chronotropic incompetence contribute significantly reduction exercise capacity patient heart failure control subject pacemaker . Methods REDUCING HEART RATE AT REST AND EXERCISE In patient sinus rhythm , present proposal utilizes heart failure medication call ivabradine . This agent , If channel blocker , specifically target sinus node lead slow heart rate . The agent approve licensed use patient heart failure dos propose . Ivabradine slow sinus rate none peripheral effect beta-blockers . Heart rate lower ivabradine improves cardiac function , outcomes related degree bradycardia achieve . In patient atrial fibrillation , present proposal recruit patient CRT atrial fibrillation undergone atrio-ventricular node ( AVN ) ablation improve efficacy CRT . Patients undergone AVN ablation dependent upon pacemaker , therefore control heart rate accurately . SUBJECT SELECTION Inclusion criterion We include patient able give inform write consent , obtain subject , capable perform peak exercise test . Since perform study three group patient , inclusion criterion group outline . Inclusion criteria - CRT-sinus rhythm group We enrol 25 patient severe CHF otherwise optimally tolerate medical therapy undergone cardiac resynchronisation therapy least 3 month previously . These individual optimal medical therapy heart failure change medication exacerbation precede 3 month . They currently take ivabradine . Inclusion criteria - CRT-atrial fibrillation group We enrol 25 patient severe CHF otherwise optimally tolerate medical therapy undergone cardiac resynchronisation therapy least 3 month previously . All patient previously pacemaker dependant 'blocked ' atrial fibrillation either due medical therapy previous atrio-ventricular nodal ablation . Inclusion criterion - control group The control subject ( n=25 ) recruit general pacemaker clinic . They undergo echocardiography exclude structural heart disease . They contraindications exercise test ivabradine . Exclusion criterion We exclude subject musculoskeletal disorder limit exercise capacity , patient peripheral vascular disease , inflammatory disorder rheumatoid arthritis , airways disease . Other exclusion include contraindication ivabradine use severe hepatic impairment , significant renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 15ml.min-1 ) , long QT syndrome . We include patient able give inform write consent , obtain subject . ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY Each subject undergo full echocardiographic examination . The image store commercially available database , ( Echopac PC , GE-Vingmed , USA ) analyse offline . We assess LV systolic diastolic function variable , mitral regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressure . EXERCISE TESTING Patients describe NYHA symptom class begin exercise session . Each individual invite familiarization test agree study . At least one week follow familiarization test , heart failure patient control return exercise laboratory randomise either ivabradine ( 7.5mg ) placebo . The following week return second arm . The randomization carry pharmacy ensure blind subject , technician investigator . After ingest capsule , subject ask wait hour exercise test commences . Prior start exercise , patient ' device program base rate 40 bts/min randomise device program either rate response . A screen separate electrocardiographic monitor , observe unblinded technician , metabolic cart , observe blinded physician . The following week mode activate . At end test device return original setting . For treadmill test use Bruce protocol modify addition 'stage 0 ' onset consist 3 minute exercise 1.61km/hr ( 1mile/hour ) 5 % gradient . During test , expire air collect continuously metabolic gas exchange analysis perform ( Vmax 29 , Sensormedics , USA ) . The system recalibrated prior test . Subjects encourage exercise exhaustion , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) , ( VCO2/VO2 ) great 1.1 take suggest maximal effort . The anaerobic threshold test calculate use VO2/VCO2 slope method . At end stage peak exercise subject ask indicate score dyspnoea fatigue scale 0 ( symptom ) 10 ( maximal symptom ) use standardise Borg score system . The slope relate symptom score ventilation ( Borg/VE ) subject plot . We also examine ventilatory variable tidal volume ( VT ) frequency ( f ) ventilation .</detailed_description>
