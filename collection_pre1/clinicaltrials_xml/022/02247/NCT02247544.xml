	<brief_summary>This Italian , multicentre , single arm , phase II study , intra-patient comparison end point . This study aim confirm activity drug trabectedin second/further line treatment retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma express term slow tumour growth . Another objective investigate peculiar benefit trabectedin typical retroperitoneal sarcoma may exploit help multidisciplinary clinical decision-making management retroperitoneal sarcoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Trabectedin Retroperitoneal Leiomyosarcoma Well Differentiated/Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma ( R-STSs ) rare neoplasm , account 10 % 15 % Soft Tissue Sarcomas ( STSs ) , represent 1-3 % cancer . They may show different histological type , predominant one retroperitoneal region : leiomyosarcoma , liposarcoma . The commonly encounter retroperitoneum well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma . First-line chemotherapy usually consist doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide . These two drug active agent adult STSs , dose-response relationship response rate 20 % 50 % . However , sarcoma community currently doubtful activity ifosfamide subgroup leiomyosarcoma . Trabectedin find mainly active leiomyosarcoma liposarcoma approve European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) second-line chemotherapy STSs . Although response rate observe pre-registration study exceed 10 % , trabectedin provide disease control , progression arrest rate exceed 50 % Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) rate exceed 20 % 6 month . Since far phase II study test activity trabectedin retroperitoneal sarcoma , specific aim study . Target population : Patients previously treat , histologically confirm , retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma . Patients may either unamenable surgery amenable addition medical treatment consider clinically advisable . Translational study perform , aim characterise tumour biological feature associate different response pattern trabectedin . These assessment do 15-20 patient undergo surgery trabectedin , compare tumour tissue specimen collect treatment .</detailed_description>
