	<brief_summary>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) common disease adult child cause obstruction upper airway sleep . Unlike adult , case paediatric SDB due presence enlarge tonsil adenoid , thus main treatment option adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) . It well know obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) adults increase risk hypertension , coronary artery disease stroke , mount evidence SDB also significant impact cardiovascular system child report elevate blood pressure , endothelial dysfunction alter autonomic cardiovascular control . Oxidative stress seem play pivotal role impair flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) consequently enhance cardiovascular risk SDB patient underlie mechanism still undefined . Previously , demonstrate endothelial dysfunction directly relate NADPH oxidase activation . Furthermore , recently assess association OSA , endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress adult show increased NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative stress arterial dysfunction partially reverse nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment . There evidence literature cardiovascular morbidity associate SDB potentially reversible child ; AT may significant role reverse cardiovascular sequela SDB ( e.g . child OSA ) . Nowadays , n't study analyze role NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative stress SDB child . The purpose current research project examine role NADPH oxidase activity , oxidative stress , inflammation endothelial function SDB child , understand mechanism involve disease .

	<detailed_description>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) spectrum diseases range primary snore obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) . Recent study suggest prevalence SDB childhood 7.4 % . In patient OSA , intermittent episode complete partial obstruction lead intermittent desaturations and/or arousal . This would result either stimulation sympathetic system suppression vagal tone may persist beyond sleep . The disturbance autonomic nervous system would result significant change cardiovascular system . The process intermittent hypoxaemia subsequent re-oxygenation also damage endothelium generation free radical . Furthermore , excessive negative intra-thoracic pressure swing generate obstruction would also affect cardiac function . In adult , OSA well document associate cardiovascular abnormality hypertension , ischaemic heart disease , arrhythmia heart failure . Oxidative stress play crucial role initiation progression atherosclerosis . In particular , imbalance superoxide nitric oxide production could responsible endothelial dysfunction , key point atherosclerotic process . Several oxidative stress-generating enzyme , include myeloperoxidase , xanthine oxidase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) may implicate arterial dysfunction ; NADPH oxidase represent , human , important source cellular superoxide anion production . Experimental study perform animal model suggest pivotal role NADPH oxidase modulate arterial tone . In particular , overexpression gp91phox ( NOX2 ) , potentiate hemodynamic response angiotensin II . Furthermore , individual impair dilation show overexpression NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox endothelial cell . Previously , demonstrate endothelial dysfunction directly relate NADPH oxidase activation ; particular demonstrate patient NADPH oxidase subunit deletion , chronic granulomatous disease , oxidative stress lower flow-mediate dilation high , compare control . Conversely , disease characterize high rate cardiovascular event ( OSAS , Peripheral arterial disease , metabolic syndrome , obesity hypercholesterolemia ) , find endothelial dysfunction NOX2 overexpression . Recently , assess association OSAS , endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress adult . Interestingly , result study indicated patient OSAS increase NOX2-generated oxidative stress arterial dysfunction partially reverse nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) treatment . There evidence literature cardiovascular morbidity associate SDB potentially reversible child ; AT may significant role reverse cardiovascular sequela SDB ( e.g . child affect OSA ) . The purpose current research project examine NADPH oxidase activity , oxidative stress , inflammation endothelial function child SDB . Expected outcomes interest advance frontier knowledge potential impact : 1. understand mechanism mediate inflammation oxidative stress involve SDB 2. assessment NADPH oxidase activity could useful tool identify SDB patient high risk cardiovascular event order prevent dramatic complication . 3 . Analyse effect surgical correction ( e.g . adenotonsillectomy ) inflammation , oxidative stress , NADPH oxidase activity endothelial function child ; adenotonsillectomy could represent potential therapeutic option reduce high cardiovascular risk SDB child . The study divide 2 phase : cross-sectional interventional study . 1 . In cross-sectional study include least 100 child ( 50 SDB child SDB 50 control ) , assess marker oxidative stress ( serum isoprostanes ) , NADPH oxidase activity , inflammation , endothelial function ( flow-mediated dilation , FMD ) carotid intima medium thickness ( IMT ) measurement . 2 . In interventional study include least 10 OSA adenotonsillar hypertrophy undergo adenotonsillectomy , evaluate marker oxidative stress ( serum isoprostanes ) , NADPH oxidase activity , inflammation endothelial function ( least 30 day ) surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
