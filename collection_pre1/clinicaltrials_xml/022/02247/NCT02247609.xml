	<brief_summary>Currently , majority B cell lymphomas cured standard chemo-radiotherapy . Most B cell lymphoma express cluster differentiation antigen 19 ( CD19 ) , represent attractive target chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -based immune cell therapy . This study evaluate novel 4th generation CD19 CAR engineer self-withdrawal mechanism ( 19273-4SCAR ) efficacy safety lymphoma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation 4th Generation Safety-designed CAR T Cells Targeting High-risk Refractory B Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 single chain antibody-based chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -engineered T cell demonstrate great clinical potential treat chronic acute B cell leukemia . B cell lymphoma , similar B cell leukemia , express CD19 surface molecule , majority B cell lymphoma patient cured standard chemo-radiotherapy . CD19 CAR-based adoptive T cell therapy associate unwanted adverse effect , loss CD19 B cell , result humoral immune deficiency . This study evaluate novel 4th generation CD19 CAR engineer self-withdrawal genetic mechanism ( 19273-4SCAR ) efficacy safety lymphoma patient . The 4th generation design CAR incorporate intracellular signal domain cluster differentiation antigen 27 ( CD27 ) , know associated T cell activation , survival longevity . The inducible caspase 9 self-withdrawal design allow rapid elimination infuse CAR T cell upon complete eradication tumor cell , follow recovery humoral immunity . Patients receive 19273-4SCAR T cell closely monitor infusion response , tumor eradication effect , longevity CAR T cell , recovery B cell function withdrawal CAR T cell .</detailed_description>
