	<brief_summary>Background : - Cervical cancer major cause cancer death among woman . Most case cervical cancer cause human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . HPV common woman human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . India one high rate woman cervical cancer HIV infection . - Cervical cancer discover early stage screen HPV infection . Researchers want compare new cervical cancer screen test HIV-infected woman . They also want know HPV lead cervical cancer HIV-infected woman . To , hold study screen HIV-infected woman India . Objectives : - To improve cervical cancer screen method HIV-infected woman India . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age HIV infection . - Participants recruit HIV-focused health care clinic Pune Chennai , India . Design : - Participants physical exam medical history . They provide urine sample proof HIV infection . - Participants gynecological exam . This involve pelvic exam Pap smear collect cell study . It also involve cervical exam look precancerous cell . Cervical tissue may collect . - Participants also provide blood sample test . - Participants return 2 week test result . If sign precancerous cancer cell , participant refer doctor treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : While HPV DNA test highly sensitive screen method cervical cancer , differentiate majority benign infection persistent infection link cervical precancer . Given high prevalence carcinogenic HPV DNA high risk cervical precancer cancer among HIV-infected woman , substantial need screen test adequately sensitive well specific , maximize detection reduce false-positive referral . Furthermore , unique immunological milieu HIV-infected woman present significant opportunity study natural history HPV-mediated cervical oncogenic process context immunosuppression . Objectives Methods : The primary objective evaluate clinical performance two novel biomarker assay detection histologically-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 severe ( great equal CIN2 great equal CIN3 ) among HIV-infected woman . These test include : ( ) immunocytostaining p16 ( INK4a ) /Ki-67 ( biomarkers correlate oncogenic transformation cervical cell follow persistent carcinogenic HPV infection ) ( ii ) test HPV E6/E7 mRNA ( express progression transient transform HPV infection ) . Secondary objective include study association risk factor biomarkers specific HPV genotype study interaction HIV HPV cervical disease category context immunosuppression . Eligibility : HIV-infected woman , 18 year old , history previous treatment cervical precancer/cancer , currently pregnant , able provide inform consent . Design : This cross sectional study conduct collaboration Indian Council Medical Research ( ICMR ) , three institution , substantial experience conduct clinical research HIV/AIDS HPV/cervical cancer : National AIDS Research Institute ( NARI ) Pune , National Institute Epidemiology ( NIE ) Chennai , Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College ( JNMC ) Belgaum . A total 1000 HIV-infected woman attend HIV care treatment clinic Pune ( n=400 ) Chennai ( n=400 ) , Belgaum ( n=200 ) recruit . According routine practice , participant undergo per-speculum examination cervical specimen collection , follow detailed diagnostic colposcopy exam biopsy indicate histological analysis . Cervical specimen use liquid-based cytology well simultaneous independent assessment p16 ( INK4a ) /Ki-67 HPV E6/E7 mRNA test . HPV DNA genotyping conduct Linear Array HPV polymerase chain reaction . We estimate clinical performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , Youden Index , positive negative likelihood ratio 95 % confidence interval ) individual test combination prevalent detection histologically-confirmed great equal CIN2 great equal CIN3 among HIV-infected woman . Additionally estimate age-specific disease-specific HPV prevalence rate HPV genotype composition , examine factor associate great equal CIN2/greater equal CIN3 lesion , examine relationship biomarker positivity HPV genotype-specific level , evaluate role immunosuppression HPV-mediated carcinogenesis . This study permit validation collection , transport , storage , implementation protocol , allow evaluation field adoption efficacy new assay , describe sensitivity specificity test combination reasonable precision wide range prevalence great equal CIN3 , provide resource study HIV-HPV coinfection .</detailed_description>
