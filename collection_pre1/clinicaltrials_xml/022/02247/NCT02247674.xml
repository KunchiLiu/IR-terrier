	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize bilateral handgrip force training would result significant improvement paretic hand , arm movement daily functional performance . In order investigate whether improvement paretic hand could facilitate motor recovery paretic arm functional performance , investigator also hypothesize motor recovery functional performance improvement paretic arm hand strongly correlation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To investigate training effect interlimb force couple train paretic hand upper extremity outcomes patient chronic stroke ; analyze relationship motor recovery paretic hand , arm functional ability . Design : A double-blind randomized control trial outcome assessment baseline 4 week intervention . Setting : Department physical medicine rehabilitation Taipei Veterans General Hospital . Participants : Thirty-three subject ( mean age = 55.1 ± 10.5 y/o ) chronic stroke recruit randomized assigned training ( n=16 ) control group ( n=17 ) . Interventions : Interlimb force couple train task include different gripforce generation hand . Main Outcome Measures : Barthel Index ( BI ) , upper extremity motor control Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA-UE ) , Motor Assessment Score ( MAS ) , Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) . All assessment execute blind evaluator , data management statistical analysis also conduct blind statistic researcher .</detailed_description>
