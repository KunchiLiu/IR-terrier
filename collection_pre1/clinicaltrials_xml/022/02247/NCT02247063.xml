	<detailed_description>Chronic temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMD ) represent clinical problem empirical treatment offer uncertain relief large number patient . Many conventional therapy ineffectual , leading persistent treatment failure and/or poor iatrogenic-induced result ; raise possibility cause pain endurance may also lie brain milieu . Although MRI-based technique provide insight neuroplastic mechanism TMD human , many question regard molecular mechanism vivo still unanswered . First , endogenous μ-opioid mechanism brain , know centrally involved pain regulation , affect acute chronic TMD pain ? Second , directly modulate provide analgesic effect pain measure ? Finally , neuroplastic effect brain continuous modulation molecular mechanism ? The understanding process crucial determine mechanism engage persistence , important , alleviation TMD . Preliminary study center , use positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ 11C ] carfentanil , selective radiotracer mu-opioid receptor ( muOR ) , demonstrate decrease μOR availability ( non-displaceable bind potential -BPND ) key pain-related structure brain chronic trigeminal pain patient , correlate clinical pain measure . We propose demonstrate acute ( masseteric pain challenge ) chronic clinical pain measure TMD patient correlate μ-opioid receptor ( µOR ) non-displaceable bind potential ( BPND ) thalamus pain-related region .</detailed_description>
