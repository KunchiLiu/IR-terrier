	<brief_title>Patient-derived Xenograft ( PDX ) Modeling Treatment Response Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) represent aggressive , genomically heterogeneous , subtype breast cancer limit therapeutic option . Many patient TNBC receive standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) pre-operatively ; response directly correlate long-term outcome . Patients residual disease NAC high risk recurrent metastatic disease , additional adjuvant therapy currently part standard care . Personalized treatment patient TNBC require improve understanding genomic landscape individual TN breast tumor , well improve predictive model response specific therapeutic agent . This pilot study determine patient-derived tumor xenograft ( PDX ) mouse model serve reliable model treatment response individual patient TNBC . The tumor tissue collect ( paired pre-and post NAC ) also provide insight mechanism therapeutic resistance individual patient . This study enhance understand genomic basis treatment response TNBC individual patient basis , lead potential new therapeutic option high-risk TNBC patient post-NAC residual disease . Objectives : 1 . To collect bank tissue specimens patient operable triple negative breast cancer : ) time diagnosis , prior start neoadjuvant therapy b ) time definitive surgery , completion neoadjuvant therapy . 2 . To collect bank tissue specimen patient advance metastatic triple negative disease prior start line therapy metastatic disease . 3 . To create patient-derived xenograft ( PDX ) mouse model utilize specimen collect pre- post- neoadjuvant treatment 4 . To determine response PDX tumor cytotoxic agent Champions Oncology Tumor GraftTM ( COTG ) assay correlate response observe patient . 5 . To perform genomic analysis patient tumor specimen collect pre- post neoadjuvant treatment study mechanisms drug resistance</detailed_description>
