	<brief_summary>Patients admit intensive care unit require mechanical ventilation frequently develop profound respiratory limb muscle weakness . Studies show development weakness ICU stay result poor outcome . Currently treatments muscle weakness , suggest weakness might improve physical therapy . Electrical stimulation method provide direct stimulation muscle potentially enhance function improve strength . The purpose study test hypothesis neuromuscular electrical stimulation quadriceps muscle improve muscle strength patient critically ill mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Muscle Weakness Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The basic study design : 1 . Obtain informed consent patient patient LAR 2 . Randomize subject treatment either : 1 . Sham therapy , consist bilateral placement Niveus Medical Muscle Stimulation System 110 electrodes 30 minute twice daily without activation electrical circuitry unit , 2 . Active therapy , use Niveus Medical Muscle Stimulation System 110 electrode actively produce rhythmic quadriceps contraction 30 minute twice daily 3 . Measure magnetic stimulate quadriceps twitch ( QuadTw ) strength bilaterally well ultrasound assessment quadriceps size 4 . Continue sham active treatment daily 7 day total 14 session 5 . Repeat measurement magnetic stimulate QuadTw strength ultrasound assessment quadriceps size Day 8 Day 8 subject discharge hospital prior allot duration sham active treatment 6 . Functional measurement patient use Functional Status Score ICU ( FSS-ICU ) end treatment period upon discharge 7 . A member research team visit subject hospital discharge record total duration ( day ) mechanical ventilation , duration ( day ) mechanical ventilation follow study entry , duration ICU stay , ventilator weaning time ( day measure time first spontaneous breathe trial extubation ) , total duration ( day ) hospitalization 8 . We also review subject 's medical record entry study obtain demographic information include following : age , sex , diagnosis , medication , reason institution mechanical ventilation , vital sign time initial visit , bedside parameter mechanical ventilation use ( include mode ventilation , duration ventilation , level oxygen , breath volume rate , % triggered breath ) , recent arterial blood gas value , chest radiograph reading time initial visit . We also record subject 's weight , BMI total intake output value since admission ICU . In addition , monitor subject 's progress ICU daily review subject 's medical record record clinical parameter well record daily weight total intake output . These parameter also assess time patient discharge ICU . In addition , record note physical therapy occupational therapy session subject receive part standard care ICU hospital time discharge . In University Kentucky hospital , occupational therapy record Barthel Index session use scale 0-100 ass individual 's functional independence perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) . Physical therapy assess functional status use Kansas University Hospital Physical Therapy Acute Care Functional Outcomes , also assess functional status category bed mobility , transfer , gait walk distance .</detailed_description>
