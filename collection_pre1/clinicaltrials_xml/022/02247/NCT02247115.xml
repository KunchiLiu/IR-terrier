The length training minimum number procedure , requisite theoretical learn methodology define competence EUS ERCP well define . The investigator research demonstrate individual train acquire skill different rate number procedure complete alone suboptimal marker competency give procedure . Hence , emphasis need shift away number procedure perform performance metric well-defined validated threshold performance . Multicenter prospective data need help guide development competency base medical education define learn curve EUS ERCP set evidence-based benchmark require achieve competence use validated competency assessment tool . Hypothesis : The central hypothesis validate EUS ERCP competency assessment tool allow reliable generalizable standardize learning curve , competency benchmark creation centralize national database compare trainee 's performance amongst peer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Competency-based medical education milestone : Given increase emphasis quality metric competency health care , Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) recently announce plan replace current reporting system 2014 Next Accreditation System ( NAS ) . This reporting system focus : 1 ) ensure milestone reach various point training , 2 ) ensure competence achieve trainee , 3 ) make certain assessment document program . Learning curve competence EUS : EUS vital tool diagnosis stag gastrointestinal certain non-gastrointestinal malignancy disease . EUS operator dependent training EUS require development technical cognitive skill beyond required standard endoscopic procedure . It intuitive quality EUS provision patient care directly proportional training , skill experience endosonographer . Unfortunately , intensity length train minimum number procedure require , requisite curriculum extent theoretical learning , methodology define competence well define . There limited data learn curve EUS image . Based expert opinion , ACGME recommend minimum 150 total supervise procedure , 75 pancreatobiliary indication 50 case fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) ( 25 pancreatic FNA ) competency determine . Similar guideline recently propose British Society Gastroenterology ( BSG ) European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy . However , guideline validate . This account different rate people learn fact , many expert believe majority trainee require double number propose procedure achieve competency EUS . Learning curve competence ERCP : ERCP effective modality evaluation management pancreatobiliary disease . This procedure technically demand associate wide range adverse event . Technically fail ERCP may result complication , need additional procedure associate cost . Similar EUS , ERCP operator dependent require acquisition certain technical cognitive skill . There limited data learn curve competence ERCP , cannulation rate &gt; 80 % ( suggest &gt; 90 % ) consider surrogate trainee competency . The American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) recommend minimum 180 total procedure , majority therapeutic competency achieve . However , threshold base predominantly biliary cannulation success rate take account procedure complexity different rate people learn . It also important note none previous study evaluate learn curve competency quality indicator successful stone extraction , traverse dilate stricture , stent placement name . Competency assessment tool : Previous competency assessment tool focus primarily limit number motor skill involve EUS ERCP procedure-related cognitive skill assessment . The investigator design prospective comprehensive competency assessment tool use validated benchmark define competency threshold . The EUS ERCP Skills Assessment Tool ( TEESAT ) use continuous fashion throughout duration training grade technical cognitive skill EUS ERCP balance manner . Significance , Innovation Impact Training Education With launch ACGME 's NAS , advance endoscopy training program utilize competency base medical education demonstrate advance endoscopy trainee ( AETs ) attain technical cognitive skill require safe effective unsupervised practice advance endoscopy . Based investigator research , investigator draw two conclusion : ) individual train technical procedure acquire skill different rate emphasis need shift away number procedure perform performance metric define validated competency threshold performance b ) current guideline perform 150 EUS 180 ERCPs inadequate achieve competence EUS ERCP , respectively . With expand indication application EUS ERCP establishment number `` third tier '' training program advance endoscopy , standardization performance EUS ERCP definition competence training among AETs paramount importance . The potential impact study 's result multifold : ) facilitate ability training program evolve new ACGME/NAS reporting requirement , ( ii ) help program directors/trainers trainees identify specific skill deficiency train allow tailor , individualized remediation , ( iii ) create centralize national database would allow generation `` on-demand '' detailed report individual trainee progress compare peer across nation , ( iv ) establish reliable generalizable standardize learning curve ( milestone ) competency benchmarks national GI society train program use develop credentialing guideline . APPROACH AND RESEARCH STRATEGY Setting Subject Recruitment : Program director AETs advance endoscopy program register ASGE invite participate study consider study participant . AETs complete questionnaire determine baseline characteristic prior experience EUS ERCP . AETs ' prior experience EUS ERCP exclusion criterion study . Competency-assessment tool : TEESAT , tool design competency assessment , use continuous fashion throughout duration training grade technical cognitive skill EUS ERCP . The investigator demonstrate feasibility validity tool previous studies.3-5 This tool use 4-point score system : 1-no assistance , 2-achieves minimal verbal cue , 3-multiple verbal cue hand assistance need , 4-unable complete . Setting anchor specific skill behavior expect achieve score ensure data collect reproducible one evaluator next . Technical aspect EUS exams include grade individual EUS station technical success EUS-FNA . Cognitive aspect include identification lesion interest , appropriate classification malignant tumor ( TNM ) stag characterization subepithelial lesion . Technical aspect biliary/pancreatic ERCP include endpoint intubation , achieve short position , identification papilla , cannulation desire duct , sphincterotomy , stone removal stent placement . Cognitive aspect include clear demonstration indication procedure , appropriate use fluoroscopy logical plan base cholangiogram/pancreatogram finding . This tool include documentation immediate post-procedure complication . Grading protocol : All AETs introduce cognitive technical aspect EUS ERCP procedures onset train . Although TEESAT self-explanatory , program director center ensure AETs trainer familiar TEESAT 's specific assessment parameter score explanation . After completion 25 hands-on EUS ERCP exam , AETs grade every ERCP 3rd EUS exam attend endoscopists ( trainer ) center . This frequency grade chosen base investigator pilot data . Grading every 3rd EUS exam oppose every exam choose give fairly homogenous population undergo EUS compare ERCP . Procedures AETs hands-on participation exclude grading . If exam eligible grade incomplete procedure reason medical instability , exam use grading . Trainers complete assessment immediately procedure .</detailed_description>
