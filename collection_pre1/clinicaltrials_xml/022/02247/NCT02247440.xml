	<brief_summary>This study HCV treatment use standard regimen pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin HIV co-infected patient participate PHPT cohort study . The treatment implemented conjunction gastro-enterologists/hepatologists internists responsible participant 's HIV treatment . Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection responsible several severe life threaten complication , worsen HIV co-infection . HIV-HCV co-infected patient high risk death compare HIV mono-infected individual , even HIV replication suppress antiretroviral treatment . The goal HCV antiviral treatment cure HCV infection . Curing HCV infection allow fibrosis regression , improved clinical outcome . In addition , individual cure longer contagious individual , therefore widespread access HCV treatment may contribute control HCV epidemic . A combination injectable pegylated-interferon oral ribavirin currently recommend regimen treatment hepatitis C set HIV co-infection . They administer 24 week HCV mono-infected patient need administer one year HIV-HCV co-infected patient . Newer drug , first generation HCV protease inhibitor ( boceprevir , telaprevir ) , administer concomitantly , use patient cure use peg-interferon + ribavirin , may allow short treatment . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 1 . To determine percentage patient accord genotype sustain virological response 6 month treatment discontinuation ( SVR ) . HCV TREATMENT - Peg-interferon alpha 2-b ( subcutaneous injection 1.5 micrograms/kg week ) - Ribavirin dose accord HCV genotype body weight ; dose adjustment case anemia . A total 60 patient could enrol study : 15 HCV-HIV co-infected patient first part ( start August 2014 ) 45 patient second part , depend funding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Population Screening : HIV infect patient positive anti-HCV test approach screen least 18 year old , participate PHPT cohort study , evidence control HIV replication CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3 currently receive antiretroviral HIV treatment ( anti-HIV regimen least 12 week ) ; HIV RNA load ≤5000 copies/ml CD4 cell ≥500 cells/mm3if receive antiretroviral treatment . Inclusion Criteria - Evidence chronic HCV infection least 6 month study entry ( least one detectable HCV viral load , i.e . ≥17 IU/mL , antibody test positive least 6 month HCV RNA load result ) - Fibrosis Stage F2-3-4 determine transient elastography ( Fibroscan similar equipment ) . During first part study , priority give patient Fibrosis Stage F2-3 . - Negative pregnancy test ( day inclusion ) . Main exclusion criterion - Anemia thrombocytopenia - Severe liver damage , advanced stage cirrhosis cancer - Uncontrolled diabetes , Uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction - Retinopathy - Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ( Cockcroft ) - Disease associate immune system - Significant heart problem - Severe neuropsychiatric condition - Contra-indication study treatment ( include pregnancy lack effective contraception participant female partner ) - Other exclusion criterion relate use ribavirin peg-interferon - Any condition , investigator 's judgment , may compromise follow . Follow After HCV treatment initiation , patient monitor safety antiviral efficacy 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 48 week ( end treatment ) 6 month treatment discontinuation . Treatment discontinue earlier patient achieve early viral response , i.e . decrease least 2 log10 HCV RNA IU/mL first 12 week HCV therapy .</detailed_description>
