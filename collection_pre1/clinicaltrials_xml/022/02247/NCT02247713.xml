	<brief_title>An International Study Use PET/CT Radiotherapy Planning Low Middle Income Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over year , incidence lung cancer rise low middle income country due rise tobacco use . Patients commonly present lung cancer advance stage ( stage III IV ) suitable surgical resection , may consider radiotherapy . For patient country suitable surgical resection , radiotherapy offer best chance cure , best improvement local cancer control , best palliation few side-effects . For accurate patient selection curative treatment accurate stag lung cancer , use fuse 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography ( FDG PET/CT ) image show superior CT alone . It also show significant impact use radiation treatment plan process particular use target volume delineation , significant reduction interobserver variation note . In recent year , many health care institution low middle income country establish Nuclear Medicine ( NM ) image routine clinical practice conjunction modern Radiation Oncology ( RO ) facility . The installation hybrid PET/CT system country permit increase use PET/CT stag radiotherapy planning . However successful implementation PET/CT radiotherapy planning ( RTP ) require degree expertise safely accurately implement imaging technique . A recently publish review International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , current trend NM develop country show still lack expertise , equipment human resource gain benefit imaging technique . In RO , difficulties implementation technique mainly related inadequate training staff lack local expertise . Quality assurance PET/CT scanner might compromise perform accord accepted nuclear medicine quality assurance standard . Therefore , concern , use without appropriate training expertise , suboptimal image quality may result inappropriate interpretation PET/CT RTP may occur . In study help provide PET Quality Control execute aim standardize PET image quality meet minimum requirement European Association Nuclear Medicine standard . Participating center assist earn European Association Nuclear Medicine ( EANM ) Research Ltd ( EARL ) accreditation . The quality imaging influence physiological technical factor . The Standardized Uptake Value ( SUV ) allow semi quantitative evaluation PET imaging , influenced factor . Spatial resolution affect SUV value significantly parameter differ lot multiple center . The EANM NEMA NU 2001/2007 2 Image Quality Phantom allow standardization PET imaging center different scanner , use activity coefficient recovery curve ( ACRC ) parameter quantification spatial resolution . It already know FDG PET/CT base RTP enables appropriate selection patient benefit curative radiation therapy . One possible cause failure radiotherapy inability accurately define tumor edge . In patient possible curative salvage treatment option disease incurable . It hop FDG PET/CT base RTP improve tumor volume delineation ( TVD ) hence improve outcome follow curative radiotherapy . There also clear evidence PET/CT standardize TVD patient NSCLC . However , know impact PET/CT base TVD patient outcome survival distinct benefit PET/CT patient selection curative treatment . Furthermore , impact training intervention use PET/CT RTP 2-year overall survival study best knowledge . This study evaluate possible impact use PET/CT TVD 2-year overall survival patient stage III NSCLC refer curative intent radiotherapy chemotherapy low middle income country , study involve retrospective cohort study , train intervention , prospective cohort study . The training intervention focus standard FDG PET/CT acquisition , FDG PET/CT image quality , stag procedure FDG PET/CT acquisition FDG PET/CT RTP acquisition Tumor Volume Delineation .</detailed_description>
