	<brief_title>Optimizing Surgical Conditions During Laparoscopic Umbilical , Incisional -and Linea Alba Herniotomy With Deep Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Umbilical herniotomy frequent surgical procedure worldwide , large hernia defect preferably operate laparoscopic technique . The advantage laparoscopic approach shorter convalescence earlier mobilization , less wound complication [ 1 ] . A preferred approach currently close defect laparoscopic suture order reduce formation seroma hernia sac [ 2 ] , apply mesh intraperitoneal onlay technique ( IPOM technique ) . However , may difficult suture defect tension abdominal wall muscle together apply pneumoperitoneum . There evidence muscle relaxation improve condition endotracheal intubation [ 3 ] reduces laryngeal morbidity study investigate necessity relaxation laparoscopic surgery [ 4 ] . During laparoscopic surgery muscle relaxation use great variability . Sometimes procedure perform without muscle relaxation sometimes so-called surgical neuromuscular blockade , objective neuromuscular monitoring mean train-of-four ( TOF ) keep 3-4 response nerve stimulation ulnar nerve . In way great variability neuromuscular blockade rarely patient receive deep neuromuscular blockade . Traditionally , neuromuscular monitoring do measure muscle strength adductor pollicis muscle thumb . The response TOF nerve stimulation may zero , muscle relaxation resistant muscle abdominal muscle diaphragm [ 5 ; 6 ] complete mean patient may cough abdominal wall may feel `` tight '' surgery , even though response thumb record . It possible quantify deep neuromuscular block use post-tetanic-count ( PTC ) . With establishment deep , continuous neuromuscular blockade PTC value 0-1 muscle include abdominal muscle diaphragm paralyze [ 7 ] . It therefore possible , deep neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) diaphragm abdominal wall muscle paralyze optimize surgical work space , ease surgical procedure , reduce operative time suture part procedure well total procedure time , reduce number recurrence long term follow-up . The purpose study investigate surgical work space surgical condition patient schedule laparoscopic umbilical , -linea alba incisional herniotomy . The patient act control evaluation surgical work space surgical condition deep NMB NMB . Hypothesis : Deep NMB define TOF=0 post-tetanic count PTC â‰¥1 , give good surgical workspace , good surgical condition , well short duration surgery reduce number recurrence hernias compare NMB .</detailed_description>
