	<brief_summary>The investigator study influence fat cell size/number adipose function weight development long time period ( year ) . By compare fat biopsy obtain baseline &gt; 7 year , investigator determine association adipose morphology/function change weight development cardiometabolic complication ( e.g . insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia hypertension ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Weight Development Over Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ask subject previously examine investigator laboratory ( 1992 forward ) study adipose tissue function interested participate new study . The minimal follow time 7 year . Saved blood sample sample old fat biopsy analyze together sample new examination . The investigator plan examine subject way perform baseline examination . This include estimation total body fat use bioimpedance , venous blood sample determination insulin , glucose lipid , subcutaneous fat biopsy determination fat cell size/number , lipolysis/lipogenesis well analysis adipokine secretion . In selected patient , baseline examination include DEXA-measurement ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) determination body fat distribution well hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp . In case , type examination repeat follow visit .</detailed_description>
