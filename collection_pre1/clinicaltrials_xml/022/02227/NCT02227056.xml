	<brief_title>Effect Methylphenidate Ecologic Function Paediatric Acquired Brain Injury Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention deficits patient acquire brain injury ( ABI ) one common cognitive disorder acquaint . Prevalence attention deficit cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) vary 20-58 % , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) may range 60 % Methylphenidate ( MPH ) central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant . In CNS increase release block reuptake dopamine noradrenalin , result increase synaptic extracellular concentration . Methylphenidate ( MPH ) , act D1 Î±2-adrenergic receptor facilitate effect prefrontal cortical modulation attention work memory .Methylphenidate use effectively safely treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder many decade . The use Methylphenidate enhance attention disorder follow TBI propose `` rational pharmacotherapy '' . It demonstrate improvement response speed , adult patient chronic TBI . In pediatric population suffering Acquired brain injury scarce work regard methylphenidate short long term efficacy . Since scarce report altogether Methylphenidate 's effect pediatric Acquired brain injury population since study examine effectiveness neuropsychological battery find interest examine effect Methylphenidate ecological task , thus achieve well understand possible effect subpopulation . STUDY ASSUMPTIONS : 1 . Methylphenidate prove safety profile pediatric population suffer primary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder secondary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . 2 . Methylphenidate positive influence attentional disorder pediatric population suffering Acquired brain injury subacute chronic phase . 3 . Methylphenidate enhance function child attentional disturbance secondary Acquired brain injury different everyday task . 4 . Methylphenidate improve learn pediatric population suffer secondary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Acquired brain injury , subacute rehabilitation period . STUDY POPULATION : The study design include 30 child , age 4-18 year , suffer attentional disturbance secondary Acquired Brain Injury ( CVA , TBI , Anoxic brain injury , Central Nervous System infection ) . Participants child hospitalize ( inpatient outpatient ) rehabilitation Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center Hospital , contraindication Methylphenidate treatment legal guardian give inform consent participation . STUDY METHODS : 1 . Before inclusion participant undergo : 1 . ECG 2 . A screened computed exam prove attentional disturbance Test Variables Attention ( TOVA ) test . 2 . Each participant test task twice two week 's period : twice without treatment Methylphenidate twice Methylphenidate treatment . 3 . Some participant retested 7-14 day treatment Methylphenidate , order estimate influence drug function continue treatment . 4 . Drug give least hour 2.5 hour test . 5 . Drug dosage 0.3 milligram/kilo round near full milligram dosage give total 3 time : Test Variables Attention ( TOVA ) exam Methylphenidate , two day participant test different task . 6 . Testing do two hour treatment session different day . 7 . Each participant undergo follow task , consecutive order : 1 . Dressing -T-shirt . Burden care grade scale The Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Functional Independence Measure Children ( WeeFIM ) accord age participant . 2 . Puzzle construction . Two different puzzle avoid possibility learning . Both level accord Sheridan 's developmental norm . 3 . Mathematical age appropriate working sheet . 4 . Interactive social game memory game . On task participant score accord number reminder give round inhibition emotional reaction win /loosing game scale 1-5 , 1 appropriate reaction , 5 high frustration . 8 . The Occupational therapist score child 's ability amount assistance need blindfold treatment ( give ) . Performance data task collect regard duration completion , amount assistance need , impulsivity , long term short term attention etc , statistically analyze . Each participant ( without Methylphenidate treatment ) serve control data collect task complete treatment Methylphenidate .</detailed_description>
