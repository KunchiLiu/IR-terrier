	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : Compare proportion deep surgical site infection within 6 month patient treat local Vancomycin powder compare treat without local Vancomycin powder . Primary Hypothesis : The proportion deep surgical site infection low patient treat local Vancomycin powder . Secondary Aim # 1 : Compare antibiotic sensitivity bacteria patient develop deep surgical site infection study patient treat local Vancomycin powder compare treat without local Vancomycin powder . Hypothesis 1 : In patient develop infection , antibiotic sensitivity profile patient treat local Vancomycin powder non-inferior treat without local Vancomycin powder . Secondary Aim # 2 : Build validate risk prediction model development deep surgical site infection patient treat without local Vancomycin powder . ( b ) Explore whether effect local Vancomycin powder modify predict risk infection . Hypothesis 2 : Patient ( e.g . medical co-morbidities ) injury ( e.g open fracture ) factor highly predictive infection risk . Hypothesis 3 : Patients higher predictive risk experience great benefit local antibiotic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All `` high energy '' tibial plateau fracture treat operatively plate screw fixation . We define `` high energy '' tibial plateau fracture patient either : Initially treat external fixation ( without limit internal fixation ) treat definitively 3 day later swell resolve . Any open type I , II , IIIA fracture , regardless time definitive treatment . Any tibial plateau fracture associate ipsilateral leg compartment syndrome fasciotomy wound . All `` high energy '' pilon ( distal tibial plafond ) fracture treat operatively plate screw fixation . We define `` high energy '' pilon fracture patient either : Initially treat external fixation ( without fibula fixation limit internal fixation ) treat definitively 3 day later swell resolve . Any open type I , II , IIIA fracture , regardless time definitive treatment . Any tibial pilon fracture associate ipsilateral leg compartment syndrome fasciotomy wound . Ages 18 80 year Patients may coexist nontibial infection , without antibiotic treatment . Patients may risk factor infection include diabetes , immunosuppression steroid medication , HIV , infection . Patients may head injury Patients may portion fixation ( e.g . fibula fixation pilon percutaneous screw across tibial plateau fracture ) prior definitive plate fixation , initial surgery randomization . Patients may orthopedic nonorthopaedic injury . Patients may preexist musculoskeletal injury , non ambulators , spinal cord injury . Women minority include The study injury : tibial plateau , pilon , already infected time study enrollment . Patient speak neither English Spanish . Patients already definitive fixation prior enrollment study . Severe problem maintain followup ( e.g . patient homeless time injury intellectually challenge without adequate family support ) . Patients allergy , drug administration reaction , sensitivity Vancomycin ( history Redman 's Syndrome ) . Pregnancy . The study injury type IIIB IIIC open fracture .</criteria>
