	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , multicenter , clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety BV single agent elderly patient first relapse primary refractory HL . BV administer single IV infusion Day 1 21-day cycle . Measures anti-cancer activity assess use revise response criterion malignant lymphoma ( Cheson et al . 2007 ) . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan ( chest , neck , abdomen , pelvis ) perform baseline Cycles 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan do baseline Cycles 4 , 8 , 12 16 . Patients End Treatment ( EOT ) assessment 30 ± 7 day receive final dose study drug . Long-term follow-up assessment ( include survival disease status information ) perform every 12 week either patient death study closure , whichever occur first . Patients discontinue study treatment stable disease well CT scan do every 12 week disease progression . Study Objectives Primary : • To determine antitumor efficacy single-agent brentuximab vedotin ( BV ) ( 1.8 mg/kg administer intravenously every 3 week ) measure overall objective response rate elderly patient first relapse primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . Secondary : - To assess duration tumor control , include duration response progression-free survival - To assess survival - To assess safety tolerability BV Additional : • To assess disease-related symptom Study Population Eligible patient first relapse primary refractory elderly HL . Patients must also histologically-confirmed CD30-positive disease , fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -avid measurable disease least 1.5 cm , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 , adequate hematologic , kidney , liver function . Eligible patient must previously treat BV , patient must congestive heart failure , know cerebral/meningeal disease , active viral , bacterial , fungal infection require treatment antimicrobial therapy within 2 week prior first study dose .</brief_summary>
