	<brief_summary>For treatment human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , publicly fund programme tend follow World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline use non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) combine two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) first-line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ; however , need data best treatment option people HIV-1 virological failure first-line regimen . The number patient fail first-line regimen increase thereby require switch second-line treatment reduce accumulation drug-resistance mutation , disease progression , HIV transmission , death . WHO guideline recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy adult consist two NRTIs + ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI ) ; atazanavir ( ATV ) plus ritonavir ( RTV ) lopinavir ( LPV ) /RTV prefer boost PI option . This study conduct demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity 48 week dolutegravir ( DTG ) contain regimen compare WHO-recommended standard care regimen second line treatment , LPV/RTV + two NRTIs , HIV-1 infect patient fail first line therapy . This study comprise Screening Phase ( approximately 28 42 day ) , Randomized Phase ( Day 1 Week 48 plus 4-week treatment extension ) , Continuation Phase . Approximately 612 subject randomize 1:1 receive DTG 50 milligram ( mg ) daily LPV/RTV ( 800/200 mg daily 400/100 mg twice daily , accordance investigator decision local label ) , add investigator select background regimen two NRTIs least one need fully active base viral resistance test Screening . Subjects randomize receive DTG successfully complete 52 week treatment continue access DTG either locally approve commercial supply available patient patient long derive clinical benefit , patient meet protocol-defined reason discontinuation .</brief_summary>

A female subject may eligible enter participate study : nonchildbearing potential define either postmenopausal ( 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea &gt; =45 year age ) physically incapable become pregnant document tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test Screening Day 1 agrees use one protocoldefined method contraception avoid pregnancy . HIV1 infection document HIV1 RNA &gt; =400 c/mL Screening . Subject firstline treatment regimen consist NNRTI plus two NRTIs least 6 month currently experience virologic failure firstline regimen define two consecutive ( &gt; =7 day apart ) HIV1 RNA result &gt; =400 c/mL . Subjects must receive least one fully active agent within dualNRTI background regimen second line treatment . Fully active define Screening genotypic resistance report central laboratory ( laboratory contract central laboratory ) show evidence full partial resistance give NRTI take study . Subject PInaïve Integrase inhibitor ( INI ) naïve , define prior current exposure PI INI . Subject subject 's legal representative willing able understand provide sign dated write informed consent prior screen . Women breastfeed . Any evidence active Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Category C disease Exceptions include cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma require systemic therapy historic current CD4+ cell level &lt; 200 cell per cubic millimeter Subjects severe hepatic impairment ( Class C ) determine ChildPugh classification Unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , oesophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Anticipated need hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) therapy Randomised Phase study . History presence allergy intolerance study drug component drug class . Ongoing malignancy cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma , basal cell carcinoma , resect , noninvasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ; localise malignancy require agreement investigator Study medical monitor inclusion subject . Subjects investigator 's judgment , pose significant suicidality risk . Recent history suicidal behaviour and/or suicidal ideation may consider evidence serious suicide risk . Treatment HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 day Screening . Treatment follow agent within 28 day Screening : radiation therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , systemically administer immunomodulators . Treatment agent , license ART allow documented activity HIV1 vitro/vivo within 28 day first dose IP . The exception use entecavir , appropriate clinical situation , treatment hepatitis B [ e.g . prior intolerance Tenofovir ( TDF ) , viral resistance lamivudine ( 3TC ) / Emtricitabine ( FTC ) ] discussion agreement investigator medical monitor . Exposure experimental drug experimental vaccine within either 28 day , 5 halflives test agent , twice duration biological effect test agent , whichever longer , prior first dose IP . Any evidence primary viral resistance PIs INIs base presence major resistanceassociated mutation . The subject 's virus yield result use genotype Screening ( assay data essential eligibility determination ) . Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality , exception Grade 4 triglyceride . A single repeat test allow Screening period verify result . Any acute laboratory abnormality Screening , , opinion Investigator , would preclude subject 's participation study investigational compound .
