	<brief_summary>Children sickle cell disease ( SCD ) risk neurobehavioral problem impact disease central nervous system . Specific impairment work memory particularly prevalent school-aged child SCD . Working memory strongly associate school readiness academic success intellectual ability general population . The adverse effect low socioeconomic status ( SES ) poverty cognition neurodevelopment emerge early , child enter formal education . In addition , affect language executive function skill ( e.g. , work memory ) skill . SES proxy variable risk factor . Higher SES associate less parental stress , supportive parenting practice , well cognitive stimulation base availability book , computer , outing . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To examine work memory school readiness young child sickle cell disease comparison demographically match control child without sickle cell disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To examine relationship family/environmental factor ( caregiver stress , parental responsiveness , cognitive stimulation home ) disease severity work memory school readiness skills preschool-aged child SCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants recruit Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic St. Jude . All participant SCD evaluate laboratory measure cognitive pre-academic skill parent questionnaire . A follow-up home visit take place study staff visit participant 's home complete HOME inventory , observational interview measure quality quantity stimulation support available child home environment . Medical history evaluate purpose characterize health status disease severity patient determine medical factor related school readiness work memory SCD population . The study expect accrue 99 participant SCD . Demographically-matched control child select database participant enrol ongoing longitudinal study neurocognitive development child bear Shelby County , Tennessee . The control group randomly select exist study group enrol MEMREAD protocol . Control group participant exclude sensory motor impairment would preclude valid testing ( e.g. , blindness , paresis ) , receive treatment non-stimulant psychotropic medication . A de-identified data file include follow result 168 demographically-matched healthy control participant ( approximately 1:2 ratio SCD healthy control ) provide control comparison purpose : - Health Evaluation ( CV4 ) - Stanford binet - Fifth Edition ( CV4 ) - Bracken Basic Concepts Scale - Third Edition ( CV4 ) - The Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function - Preschool Version ( BRIEF-P ) ( CV4 ) - The Scales Independent Behavior - Revised , Early Development Form ( SIB-R ) ( CV4 ) - Demographics ( CV4 ) - Additional Covariates ( ) include gestational age birth , developmental delay , major medical illness , surgery history , neurological event history , pre-kindergarten attendance , daycare attendance</detailed_description>
