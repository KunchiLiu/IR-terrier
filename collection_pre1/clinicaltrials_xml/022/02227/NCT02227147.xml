	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy 20 µg/ml 6 time day rhNGF eye drop solution ( formulation contain anti-oxidant ) compare vehicle ( formulation contain anti-oxidant ) give 6 time day . The evaluation efficacy intend : - complete healing stage 2 ( persistent epithelial defect ) 3 ( corneal ulcer ) neurotrophic keratitis ( NK ) measure central reading center use corneal fluorescein staining , - assess duration complete healing , - improvement visual acuity improvement corneal sensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old . Patients stage 2 ( persistent epithelial defect , PED ) stage 3 ( corneal ulcer ) neurotrophic keratitis . PED corneal ulceration least 2 week duration refractory one conventional nonsurgical treatment neurotrophic keratitis . Evidence decrease corneal sensitivity ( ≤ 4 cm use CochetBonnet aesthesiometer ) within area PED corneal ulcer outside area defect least one corneal quadrant . Best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) score ≤ 75 ETDRS ( Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ) letter , ( ≥ 0.2 LogMAR , ≤ 20/32 Snellen ≤ 0.625 decimal fraction ) affect eye ( ) . No objective clinical evidence improvement PED corneal ulceration within 2 week prior study enrolment . Only patient satisfy Informed Consent requirement may include study . The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read , sign date Informed Consent document studyrelated procedure perform . The Informed Consent form sign patient and/or legal representative must approve IRB ( Institutional Review Board ) current study . Patients must ability willingness comply study procedure . Any active ocular infection active ocular inflammation relate NK affect eye ( ) . Any ocular disease require topical ocular treatment course study treatment period . No topical treatment study medication provide study sponsor allow study protocol administer affected eye ( ) course study treatment period . Patients severe vision loss potential visual improvement opinion investigator result study treatment . Schirmer test without anesthesia ≤3 mm/5 minute . Patients severe blepharitis and/or severe meibomian gland disease . History ocular surgery ( include laser refractive surgical procedure ) within three month study enrolment . ( An exception precede statement allow ocular surgery consider cause stage 2 3 NK ) . Ocular surgery allow study treatment period elective ocular surgery procedure plan duration followup period . Prior surgical procedure ( ) treatment NK exception amniotic membrane transplantation . Patients previously treat amniotic membrane transplantation may enrol two week membrane disappear within area PED corneal ulcer least six week date amniotic membrane transplantation procedure . Patients previously treat Botox injection use induce pharmacologic blepharoptosis eligible enrolment last injection give least 90 day prior enrolment study . Anticipated need use therapeutic contact lenses contact lens wear refractive correction study treatment period eye ( ) NK . Anticipated need punctual occlusion study treatment period . Patients punctual occlusion punctual plug insert prior study eligible enrolment provide punctual occlusion maintain study . Evidence corneal ulceration involve posterior third corneal stroma , corneal melt perforation . Presence history ocular systemic disorder condition might hinder efficacy study treatment evaluation , could possibly interfere interpretation study result , could judge investigator incompatible study visit schedule conduct . Any need anticipate change dose systemic medication know impair function trigeminal nerve . These treatment allow study initiate prior study enrolment provide remain stable throughout course study treatment period . Known hypersensitivity one component study procedural medication ( e.g . fluorescein ) . History drug , medication alcohol abuse addiction . Use investigational agent within 4 week screen visit . Participation another clinical study time present study . Females childbearing potential exclude participation study meet one follow condition : currently pregnant , positive result urine pregnancy test Randomization Visit , intend become pregnant study treatment period , breastfeed willing use highly effective birth control measure .</criteria>
