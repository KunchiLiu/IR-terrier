	<detailed_description>Alcohol substance use disorder ( AOSUDs ) , primarily cannabis use disorder , continue significant public health concern among American adolescent . AOSUDs commonly accompany co-occurring psychiatric disorder include depression . This comorbidity associate increased severity AOSUD , earlier treatment termination , poor outcome , increase suicidal risk . Presently neither consensus standard , evidence-based intervention address need effective feasible treatment disorder . However , cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) find effective disorder , separately . In addition , , , adolescents disorder , depression appear respond rapidly CBT target alcohol substance abuse . This suggest early depression responder ( EDRs ) may need additional treatment target depression directly , unlike non-early responding ( NEDR ) counterpart . However , study compare long term outcomes adolescent EDRs NEDRs . Moreover , randomize , control study test hypothesis integrate CBT intervention co-occurring AOSUD depression effective disorder , NEDR adolescent . In two-site study , submit response PA : PAS-10-251 , recruit 170 eligible adolescent ( 102 University Connecticut 68 Duke University ) , age 13 year 21 years-11 month , alcohol cannabis use disorder clinically significant depression . All subject receive 12 session Motivation Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavior Therapy ( MET/CBT-12 ) , standard , evidence-based intervention alcohol drug abuse 12 14 week . After four week , NEDR adolescents randomized depression treatment augmentation , either seven session CBT ( CBT-D ) , integrate MET/CBT-12 , enhance depression-treatment-as-usual community ( D-ETAU ) . We estimate 120 adolescent randomize ; stratify randomization gender , age , presence/absence Major Depressive Episode . We assess 170 participant baseline , week 4 , 9 , 14 ( treatment ) , 3- , 6- , 9-month follow-up . The first aim study describe percentage depress AOSUD adolescent demonstrate EDR alcohol cannabis abuse treatment alone , examine EDR durability EDR predictor . The second third aim test hypothesis , NEDR teens , integrate treatment augmentation ( CBT-D ) lead good depression alcohol cannabis outcome , respectively , augmentation D-ETAU . We compare outcomes three group ( EDRs ; NEDRs augmentation ) , alcohol use , depressive symptom , alcohol- cannabis-related functional impairment , maintenance alcohol cannabis treatment gain , depression remission rate time , analyze temporal ordering change alcohol cannabis use depression treatment . This first study test adaptive treatment model depress alcohol cannabis use disorder youth , thus significant potential guide clinical practice .</detailed_description>
