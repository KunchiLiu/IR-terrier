	<brief_summary>The purpose study test Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System patient severe age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . The Argus II System already study completely blind patient retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) . In RP patient , cell retina irrevocably damage Argus II System find restore basic visual function . On ground , device receive authorization use European market ( CE certification ) 2011 . In study , 5 subject severe dry AMD legally blind implanted Argus II System . The study evaluate safety device surgery , well function system extent restore vision . Each subject follow 3 year , eye health visual function test multiple time point .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subject must consent participate study ; 2 . Subject must 25 85 year age ; 3 . Subject must diagnose dry AMD ( i.e. , evidence drusen hyperplasia RPE eye geographic atrophy secondary dry AMD ) ; 4 . Severely sight impaired meet follow additional criterion : 1 . Visual acuity logMAR 1.0 ( 6/60 ) bad eye measure ETDRS ; 2 . Hand motion worse central vision eye implant , measure pinhole occluder ; 3 . Geographic atrophy ( confirm Fundus Autofluorescence ) central scotoma ( confirmed microperimetry ) central 20Â° ; 5 . Subject must pseudophakic IOL successfully implant study eye least 2 week baseline testing , aphakic clear capsule . If applicable , posterior laser capsulotomy may perform 2 week baseline test perform ; 6 . Subject must motivate competent learn use Argus II System ( Investigator 's assessment ) , willing able commit study requirement . This include understanding requirement study acceptance time involve participate ; 7 . Subject must suffer nonophthalmic serious adverse event ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , etc . ) noncurable life threaten condition ( e.g . cancer ) time Baseline visit . 1 . Ocular disease condition could prevent Argus II implant work ( e.g. , optic nerve disease , central retinal artery vein occlusion , history retinal detachment , trauma , etc . ) ; 2 . Evidence active submacular choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) implant eye ; 3 . Ocular structure condition could prevent successful implantation Argus II Implant adequate healing surgery ( e.g . extremely thin conjunctiva ; axial length &lt; 20.5 mm &gt; 26 mm ; corneal ulcer ; abnormality typical curvature retina like staphyloma cause significant protrusion depression area centralis could compromise optimal position electrode array , active severe blepharitis , etc . ) ; 4 . Ocular disease condition ( cataract ) prevent adequate visualization inner structure eye ( e.g. , corneal opacity ) ; 5 . An Implantable Miniature Telescope either eye ; 6 . Predisposition eye rubbing ; 7 . Any disease condition prevents understand communication inform consent , study demand , test protocol , include : 1. cognitive decline include diagnosed form dementia and/or progressive neurologic disease , 2. psychiatric disease include diagnose form depression ; 3. speak principal language associate region , 4. deafness selective frequency hear loss prevents hear device alarm alert ; 8 . Pregnant wish become pregnant course study ; 9 . Participating another investigational drug device study may conflict objective , followup test study ; 10 . Inability tolerate general anaesthesia recommend antibiotic steroid regimen associate implantation surgery ; 11 . Conditions likely limit life le 1 year time inclusion .</criteria>
