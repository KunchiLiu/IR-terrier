	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose tipifarnib give together radiation therapy temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . Tipifarnib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving tipifarnib together radiation therapy temozolomide may better way treat glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) tipifarnib ( R115777 ) combination temozolomide radiation patient enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . II . To define safety R115777 combination temozolomide radiation patient population . III . To assess evidence antitumor activity patient population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study tipifarnib . TIPIFARNIB : Patients receive tipifarnib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY DURING RADIATION THERAPY : Within 5-9 day start tipifarnib , patient undergo external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) daily receive temozolomide PO daily 6 week . POST-RADIATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Beginning week 10 post-radiation therapy , patient receive temozolomide PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 1 year 12 complete course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month .</detailed_description>
