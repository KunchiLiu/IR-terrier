	<brief_summary>The majority breast cancer patient receive radiotherapy part treatment . Radiotherapy improve locoregional control overall survival . In patient breast cancer locoregional recurrence rate ( LRR ) low , however still high LRRs find certain patient group , especially locally advanced , inflammatory triple negative breast cancer . Olaparib potent PARP inhibitor develop anti-cancer drug homologous recombination ( HR ) defect tumor dose intensifier chemo- radiotherapy . The combination olaparib radiotherapy expect improve locoregional control thereby overall survival breast cancer patient high probability locoregional recurrence patient HR deficient tumor . However , combination treatment never test human . The purpose study determine safety tolerability radiotherapy breast regional lymph node concurrent olaparib .</brief_summary>
