	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study use avatrombopag Japanese subject thrombocytopenia associate chronic liver disease . This study assess effect avatrombopag platelet count Japanese subject . Subjects enrol 2 cohort accord mean platelet count measure Screening Baseline . Within low baseline platelet count cohort ( le 40 x 10^9/L ) , subject randomized 1:1:1:3 ratio receive placebo , 20 mg avatrombopag , 40 mg avatrombopag , 60 mg avatrombopag 5 day . Within high baseline platelet count cohort ( 40 less 50 x 10^9/L ) , subject randomized 2:1:2 ratio receive placebo , 20 mg avatrombopag , 40 mg avatrombopag 5 day .</brief_summary>
