	<brief_summary>Bioactive compound mango bioavailable anti-inflammatory efficacy demonstrate animal human . However , efficacy mango previously compare respect mild inflammatory bowel disease . In order justify future pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis human clinical trial , pilot assessment determine efficacy prevent resolve Inflammatory bowel disease necessary step . Therefore , aim determine clinical relevance mango adjuvant treatment conventional therapy Inflammatory bowel disease . The effect mango common drug treatment mild-moderate Inflammatory bowel disease compare drug-treatment alone . If mango polyphenolic-rich food could identify helpful shorten reduce severity episode inflammatory bowel disease , addition polyphenolics conventional drug treatment Inflammatory bowel disease would significant impact public health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical study design randomize , control trial subject mild-moderate active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) mild moderate ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . This study carry randomized cross-over design 8 week mango fiber treatment follow 4 week wash-out period 8 week treatment . Subjects inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ; CD UC ) recruit patient record Ertan Digestive Disease Center advertisement ( letter , email , flyer , newspaper ) . Additionally , patient may recruit standard clinical care clinic : ) patient come regular , e.g . semi-annual annual routine colonoscopy , b ) UC CD-related pain symptom , c ) individual present diarrhoea may due Crohn 's disease UC may also recruit . Informed write consent obtain research personnel study begin . Approximately 90 individual expect enroll study order obtain 60 subject complete study ( consider screen failure potential drop-outs ) . We expect maximum 90 subject initial screen since many preselected exist patient file . If subject schedule one regular check-up endoscopy , result endoscopy used ass eligibility subject participation study . This study design incorporate standard care routine exam perform within division gastroenterology . During initial screening , inclusion criterion patient assess use clinical index . perform screen list inclusion criterion hemoglobin , exclusion parameter height , weight , calculation BMI kg/ ( height meter ) 2 , albumin C-reactive protein assess due high correlation IBD-activity ( &gt; 45 mg/L ) . Additionally , hematocrit ( HcT ) , erythrocyte sedimentation , blood cell count , vitamin D status ( base association IBD Vitamin D deficiency . Subjects ask give stool sample take place within 1 week endoscopic procedure schedule laxative take patient preparation procedure . Fecal calprotectin fecal lactoferrin may collect standard clinical care information use study . Study Treatments : A ) Standard clinical care + Fiber treatment ( commercially available fiber product , equivalent fiber contain mango treatment ) B ) Standard clinical care + 200-400g Mango b.i.d - t.i.d. , frozen smoothie . Subjects ask record exact amount consume day . Subjects skip less 1 day mango consumption per week le 8 day entire period 8 week mango consumption exclude study . Subjects randomize accord statistician 's guideline two group either start study treatment A ) B ) . Subjects consume regular diet reduce intake plant-based dietary supplement contain secondary plant compound resveratrol , quercetin , tannin , also reduce carbohydrate-derived energy amount supply mango consumption . Patients receive mango consume regular diet , control basic nutrient contain mango treatment . The mango treatment start either first study day , soon subject classify within inclusion criterion . Subjects underwent endoscopy begin study need wait least one week study treatment start . The study duration 20 week , consist 8 week treatment , 4 week wash-out another 8 week treatment randomize crossover design .</detailed_description>
