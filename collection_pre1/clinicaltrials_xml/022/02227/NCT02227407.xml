	<brief_title>Reciprocating Gait Orthoses Paraplegia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ambulation rehabilitation priority many paraplegic patient , either psychological reason aim achieve partial full independence . It also provide therapeutic benefit widely acknowledge improve urinary drainage , improve peripheral circulation , prevent complication cause bedridden , contracture , osteoporosis , urinary tract infection , constipation etc . Some study also find ambulation increase cardiopulmonary function . For pediatric spinal cord-injured patient , upright posture also profit development trunk head control . There number reciprocate gait orthoses ( RGOs ) available practice paraplegic , problem slow , heavy high energy-consumption . The biomechanical cause fully understood . Despite benefit RGOs offer , research clinical experience indicate paraplegia patient choose wheelchair mobility discharge community faster , safe need less energy expenditure . Therefore , biomechanical study pathological gait paraplegia patient RGOs critically need . The problem currently apply RGOs need analyze remedial mean propose . In addition , new RGOs system also need serve research tool platform prove remedial idea . Literature Review : There many kind gait orthoses prescribe paraplegic , group accord pattern propulsion . The first type group swing-through gait orthoses include Knee-Ankle-Foot orthoses ( KAFO ) , Hip-Knee-Ankle-Foot orthoses ( HKAFO ) , parapodium . The swing-through gait high energy cost user give orthoses easily . Swivel walker belong second group , enable paraplegic patient ambulate upright position without use crutch walk aid . Patients progress shift center gravity ; increase walk speed swing arm rotation trunk . Loretta et al . compare swivel gait swing gait , show swivel gait slow speed efficient gait implies lower metabolic cost oxygen consumption need . Although swivel walker advantage provide low energy hand-free walking , criticize low walk speed inability ambulate uneven surface . The third one group reciprocate gait orthoses develop belief would provide energy efficient gait gait orthoses . The LSU RGOs develop early 1980 's hip joint link act reciprocal pattern . In early 1990s , two revise version LSU RGOs develop , ARGOs ( Advanced RGOs use one cable IRGOs ( Isocentric RGOs ) use solid rocker bar . The hip guidance orthosis ( HGOs ) provide friction-free hip joint also allow patient walk reciprocally . WO , walkabout orthosis , infraperineal structure also facilitate reciprocate walk . Comparing HKAFO , RGOs heavy , slow , energy cost ( mL/kg/m ) high although energy consumption rate ( mL/kg/min ) significantly high child HKAFOs . To achieve efficient gait overcome problem slow , hybrid system , combination FES RGOs , show possibility improvement . Because system use RGOs structural stability muscle power stimulate FES decrease activity trunk muscle prevention fatigue , provide energy-efficient gait increase aerobic-anaerobic threshold patient long term . Many orthotic option paraplegia available provide limit walking function great energy consumption , reason frequent abandonment low utilization RGOs . To improve design reduce energy expenditure , require biomechanical analysis pathological gait gait deviation energy consume mechanism identify remedial mean implement . There recent research biomechanical analysis ARGOs user 's gait possible mechanism contribute high energy consumption discuss . However , remedial action term design parameter suggest work . It obvious research biomechanical study need advance development orthotic solution paraplegia patient . Gait determinant identify source affect energy expenditure . The determinant include pelvic rotation , pelvic list , knee flexion mid-stance , foot ankle motion , knee motion lateral pelvic displacement . There study evaluate effect kinematic gait determinant reduction vertical displacement Body Center mass ( BCOM ) . Gard Childress find magnitude trunk 's vertical excursion virtually unaffected pelvic list . Kerrigan point primary gait determinant need explain actual reduction BCOM vertical displacement . A reduction BCOM vertical excursion may significant energy implication , require kinetic consideration prove gait determinant affect energy expenditure . Kinetic consideration give study analysis mechanical energy emphasize exchange potential kinetic energy . A study normal subject suggest great exchange potential kinetic energy near individually prefer walking speed . Since previously find self-selected speed minimize energy cost , readily induce normal gait lower energy cost implies great conservation mechanical energy , i.e. , great exchange potential kinetic energy . It remain unclear role gait determinant play conserve mechanical energy . In addition , joint biomechanics dynamic coordination particularly could never overemphasize energy consumption ambulation concern . Gait efficiency term energy cost ankle fusion patient reach 90 % hip fusion patient achieve 53 % gait efficiency . The ankle fusion require major compensatory movement gait pattern local substitution mid forefoot area observe . When hip knee disturb , patient require pay energy consumption compensatory substitution lose function hip knee . It imply coordination knee hip high priority ankle human coordinate knee hip movement could negotiate fairly well even ankle disturbance walk maintain energy consumption speed . A hybrid orthosis system ( HOS ) study walk spinal-cord injury ( SCI ) , coordinate mechanical lock unlocking knee ankle joint reciprocate gait orthoses , propulsive force inject unlocked joint control functional neuromuscular stimulation . A feasibility study carry functional neuromuscular stimulation power mechanical gait orthosis coordinate joint locking ( stance control KAFO ) . A laboratory hybrid RGOs develop use HKAFO contain controllable friction brake hip knee joint . A computer-controlled orthosis system develop address problem rapid muscle fatigue poor movement control characteristic FES-aided gait . However , theme hip knee coordination . In order coordination hip knee joint study , computer simulation experiment validation necessary . Therefore , research tool need develop study conduct effectiveness knee hip coordination reduction energy expenditure ambulation paraplegia patient reciprocate gait orthoses . Research Objectives : In research , investigator hypothesis include would exist energy save mechanism human reciprocate locomotion base principle conservation mechanical energy.Secondly , kinematic kinetic gait determinant could derive energy save mechanism . Finally , control knee joint coordinate hip joint movement would facilitate gait progression reduce energy consumption . Experimental equipment , device protocol : The patient evaluation , RGOs design fabrication , fit do supervision qualify orthotists Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center National Taiwan University ( NTURERC ) . A Cosmed K4b2 portable gas analysis system use acquire physiological measure heart rate oxygen consumption . A three dimensional motion measurement system ( Optotrak® Certus™ , Northern Digital Inc. , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada ) two position sensor , three camera , use collect kinematic data . Twelve rigid body active marker attach segment subject leave upper arm , thigh , shank , heel , pelvis trunk . Eight force plate ( AMTI ) use calculate kinetics segment low limb use assistance . Participants give instruction experiment . Patient 's medical data diagnosis , onset , birth date , gender , height weight take basic data normal subject ' collect well . Paraplegic subject walk self select speed complete least three trial . The kinematic kinetic data collect synchronously . Patients ask walk self select speed 30 meter along designate route three time order measure heart rate oxygen consumption .</detailed_description>
