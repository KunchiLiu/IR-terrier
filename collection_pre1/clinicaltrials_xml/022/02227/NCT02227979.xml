	<brief_summary>The propose study design investigate whether PURPLE Crying program attains efficacy optimize neural response anterior insula , augment activity region brain know important emotion regulation . The aim determine effect PURPLE Cry Intervention investigate follow : - independent variable may affect father 's neural response infant cry - effect PURPLE cry intervention , compare control intervention , father ' report aversiveness empathy response cry stimulus - effect PURPLE cry intervention , compare control intervention , father ' neural response unknown infant cry compare tone control - effect PURPLE cry intervention , compare control intervention , father ' neural response infant cry compare unknown infant cry The investigator hypothesize : - prior PURPLE material , father ' neural response infant cry stimulus modulate follow variable : subjective self-reported emotional reaction cry stimulus , hormone level , sleep quality quantity , sex infant , infant temperament , life stressor , parental expectation , personality ( neuroticism ) , father 's childhood experience - father receive PURPLE material compare receive control intervention report large decrease aversiveness large increase empathy response cry stimulus - father receive PURPLE material compare receive control intervention show large decrease activity anterior insula amygdala response cry stimulus - father receive PURPLE material compare receive control intervention show large increase activity region brain important emotion regulation , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) orbitofrontal PFC - father ' neural activity amygdala response infant 's cry stimuli positively correlate infant testosterone level</brief_summary>
