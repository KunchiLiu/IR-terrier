	<brief_summary>Pacemakers ICD 's traditionally accepted contraindication MRI due safety concern . Recent work laboratory well pilot study approximately 500 patient show safety contemporary implant rhythm management device MRI environment give appropriate precaution . Because investigator complete test animal weigh little 80 lb . without incident , investigator feel safely image child weight great ( Circulation 2004 ; 110:475-482 ) . The goal study expand pilot study develop protocol , consistent Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) requirement , increase safety experience clinically indicate MR image patient implanted cardiac pacemaker ICD 's . This cohort study . One thousand seven hundred patient clinical need MRI recruit . Risks Benefits associate Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) image set implantable device discuss informed consent obtain . The type device lead ascertain . Patients monitor physician Registered Nurse ( RN ) ACLS certification familiarity ICD/Pacemaker programming study . When image child meet age weight criterion , physician present entire study . Fellow attend radiology electrophysiology support available house case . Standard device test include battery voltage , threshold , sense lead impedance measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study develop protocol , consistent DHHS/ Center Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) guideline requirement document safety clinically indicate MR image patient implanted cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD 's ) pacemaker . MRI 's conducted patient require clinically indicate MRI . All study do 1.5 Tesla MRI unit . ECG monitor pad place patient duration study . An external defibrillator Advance Cardiovascular Life Support ( ACLS ) drug hand . Heart rate , blood pressure , O2 saturation also monitor non-invasively throughout study . All device undergo complete interrogation prior image . Parameters atrial ventricular pacing threshold , R P wave amplitude , lead impedance , battery status measure record . PPMs program asynchronous mode dependent inhibit mode patient without pacemaker dependence . The pacemaker function ICD 's pacemaker independent patient program ventricular inhibit ( VVI ) mode 50 bpm . Pacemaker dependant patient ICDs exclude . In addition , theoretical concern patient cap abandon lead chest may risk heat . While little objective data support concern , give theoretical concern , patient category admit study refer physician deems MRI critical PI carefully consider risk/benefit ration patient fall category . Similarly , historically also concern newly implant lead ( &lt; 4 week ) risk lead dislodgement d/t possible torque MRI environment . This theoretical concern little scientific evidence support claim . Nevertheless , patient newly implant pacemaker/ICD lead consider PI protocol inclusion refer physician deems MRI critical consider risk/benefit individual patient . After appropriate MRI protocol MRI patient 's unique condition complete , device re-programmed original setting completely interrogate detect change device performance .</detailed_description>
