	<detailed_description>1 . Experimental Design : Approximately 50 male female participant age 18 65 year , high risk cardiovascular disease hospitalization due cardiovascular disease , recruit participate 12 week study . All familiarization test conduct Exercise &amp; Sport Nutrition Laboratory ( ESNL ) Department Health Kinesiology Texas A &amp; M University . Assays conduct Institute Obesity Cancer research Laboratory Texas A &amp; M University . 2 . Screening familiarization Session : Participants express interest study interview phone determine whether qualified participate . The participant believe meet eligibility criterion invite attend entry/familiarization session . During session , participant complete medical personal history , sign consent statement compliance Human Participants Guidelines Texas A &amp; M University American College Sports Medicine . Participants underwent general physical examination verify meet eligibility criterion . Participants satisfy criterion familiarize study protocol receive verbal write explanation study protocol design . Following baseline measurement , participant match base gender , age , BMI randomly assign double-blind manner control ( n=25 ) acai supplementation group ( n=25 ) . Participants give appointment time perform baseline assessment three session . 3 . Baseline assessment dietary intervention : Prior baseline testing , participant recommend take herbal supplement anti-oxidant juice orange , pomegranate , acai juice . Vitamin pill , supplement sports/energy drink large amount berry also avoid . In addition , spinach , tomato , bell pepper , onion , garlic , carrot , chocolate , yellow/orange fruits/vegetables dark green fruits/vegetables reduce one serve 48 hour . Participants instruct refrain exercise 48 hour prior baseline test . During baseline testing , participant record food intake dietary record form four day . Participants donate 20ml fast blood use venipuncture technique antecubital vein forearm . Participants ask drink one 10 oz serve test beverage . A second blood draw take two hour ingestion . All urine output 24 hour lead baseline test collect . 4 . Supplementation : Participants recommend consume two serving test beverage part current , non-modified diet . Each serve supply 10 oz bottle , consume morning evening day throughout duration study ( 12 week ) . Participants control group consume equal amount placebo juice comprise artificially colored water contain sugar , citric acid , flavor identical acai beverage , phytochemical-based constituent throughout time period . Participants individually instruct adjust daily caloric intake account calorie beverage . All participant pick weekly supply either acai beverage placebo Exercise &amp; Sport Nutrition Laboratory . 5 . Follow-up testing : Participants report back lab follow-up test 4 , 8 , 12 week baseline test . During test session , participant complete full battery test complete initial baseline test . Participants ask maintain similar diet three day prior test session order monitor influence test beverage . Participants give list prefer food group three day ask stick closely possible . 6 . Body composition : During baseline measurement follow-up testing session , height measure use standard anthropometry . Total body weight measure use Healthometer ( Bridgeview , IL ) self-calibrating digital scale precision +/-0.02 kg . Body composition ( exclude cranium ) determine use Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA , Hologic Inc , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 7 . Blood urine collection : During test session , participant donate approximately 2 teaspoon fast venous blood ( 10 milliliter ) . Blood sample obtain use standard phlebotomy procedure use standard sterile venipuncture antecubital vein ESNL laboratory technician graduate research assistance train phlebotomy compliance guideline establish Texas Department Health Human Services .</detailed_description>
