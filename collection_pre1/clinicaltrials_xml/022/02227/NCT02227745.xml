	<brief_summary>Photocoagulation standard treatment focal EMCS , disrupt vascular leakage allow pigment epithelium remove intraretinal fluid effective reduce incidence visual loss reduce contrast sensitivity retinal sensitivity , characteristic function reduce setting ( location stability ) relevant quality patient 's vision parameter , read comprehension , especially ability , duration diabetic macular edema , could significant impact survival / functional reserve macular cell subject mechanical toxic stress-induced edema . It seem treatment patient EMCS , photoreceptor damage occur recent phenomenon , precede neurodegeneration retinal photoreceptor loss , whereby visual function decrease . An adjunctive treatment Dorzolamide facilitate effect help resorption intraretinal fluid EPR reduce adverse event loss contrast sensitivity retinal sensitivity , response time photocoagulation treatment could reduce patient , rate resorption intraretinal fluid facilitate thus duration response , also could reduce damage vision cause inadequacy photoreceptors evolution macular edema avoid moderate visual loss , increase quality life term improve quality vision diabetic patient . In addition obtain specific adjuvant treatment photocoagulation helpful focal edema diabetic new level use dorzolamide retina Dorzolamide adjunctive therapy focal photocoagulation effective placebo improve visual function patient diabetic macular edema</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients refer ophthalmology develop type 2 diabetes subspecialist ophthalmologist evaluate macula biomicroscopy , pupillary dilation , detect clinically significant macular edema . EMCS diagnosis make accord ETDRS criterion , patient request submit fluorescein angiography . Patients present focal leakage angiography schedule focal photocoagulation ; day focal photocoagulation measure procedure Measurement visual acuity , visual acuity , refraction Measuring contrast sensitivity Measurement retinal sensitivity Measurement Optical Coherence Tomography ophthalmoscopic review Subsequently photocoagulation treatment apply accord guideline ETDRS ( 1-50 number shot , shot diameter 100 micron 120-180 mW power ) patient re-evaluated 4 week , repeat test day photocoagulation . The patient research project discuss , invited participate , read inform consent explain , question concern clarify study , patient agree enter study assign random treatment . Patient 1 drop topical drug treaty provide every 8 hour 4 week eye place , drug provide need 4 week , plus control sheet dose delivery provide shall reference April week later evaluation : After 4 week topical treatment , evaluation 8:00 11 pm first date</detailed_description>
