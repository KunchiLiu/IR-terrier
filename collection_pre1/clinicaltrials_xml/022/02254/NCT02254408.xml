	<criteria>Received autologous allogeneic HCT use condition regimen Documented RSVpositive determine local testing ( eg , polymerase chain reaction , direct fluorescence antibody , respiratory viral panel assay , culture ) use upper respiratory tract sample collect ≤ 6 day prior Day 1 New onset least 1 follow respiratory symptom ≤ 7 day prior Day 1 : nasal congestion , runny nose , cough , sore throat , worsen one chronic ( associate previously exist diagnosis , eg , chronic rhinorrhea , seasonal allergy , chronic lung disease ) respiratory symptom ≤ 7 day prior Day 1 No evidence new abnormality consistent LRTI chest Xray relative recent chest Xray , determine local radiologist . If chest Xray available obtain standard care &lt; 48 hour prior screen , chest Xray must obtain screen O2 saturation ≥ 92 % room air An informed consent document sign date participant legal guardian participant investigator his/her designee A negative urine serum pregnancy test require female participant ( unless surgically sterile great two year postmenopausal ) Male female participant childbearing potential must agree contraceptive requirement describe study protocol Willingness complete necessary study procedure available work telephone email Related concomitant previous medication use : Use nonmarketed ( accord region ) investigational agent within 30 day , OR use monoclonal antiRSV antibody within 4 month 5 halflives screen , whichever longer , OR use investigational RSV vaccine HCT Related medical history : Pregnant , breastfeeding , lactate female Unable tolerate nasal sample require study , determine investigator Known history HIV/AIDS CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/μL within last month History drug and/or alcohol abuse , opinion investigator , may prevent adherence study activity Related medical condition screening : Documented positive respiratory virus ( limited influenza , parainfluenza , human rhinovirus , adenovirus , human metapneumovirus , coronavirus ) within 7 day prior screen visit , determine local testing ( additional testing require ) Clinically significant bacteremia fungemia within 7 day prior screen adequately treat , determine investigator Clinically significant bacterial , fungal , viral pneumonia within 2 week prior screen adequately treat , determine investigator Excessive nausea/vomiting screening , determine investigator , inability swallow pill preclude oral administration investigational medical product ( participant without nasogastric tube place ) Any condition , opinion investigator , would prevent full participation trial would interfere evaluation trial endpoint Related laboratory result : Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ( calculate use CockcroftGault method ) Clinically significant aspertate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase , determine investigator Clinically significant total bilirubin , determine investigator</criteria>
