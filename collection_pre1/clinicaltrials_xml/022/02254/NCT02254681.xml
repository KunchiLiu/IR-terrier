	<brief_title>Study Low-Dose Radiation Therapy Whole Liver Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( IHC ) cancer pathologic feature biliary tract differentiation arise intrahepatic bile duct and/or trans-differentiation hepatocytes . IHC second common primary liver cancer incidence mortality rate increase worldwide United States . Approximately 80 % IHC Western hemisphere mass-forming type . Liver disease represent major obstacle long-term survival among patient IHC . While partial hepatectomy offer hope cure , le 30 % IHC resectable initial presentation.2 Most patient locally advanced disease ( e.g . multi-focal tumor , major vascular invasion , local invasion surround organ , and/or regional lymph node metastasis ) . Each factor portend poor 5-year survival ( ~20 % ) surgical extirpation thus consider unresectable disease surgeon current era . Moreover , liver common site disease recurrence resection IHC 60-80 % initial disease recurrence occur liver remnant . Published response rate preoperative definitive radiation therapy ( RT ) cholangiocarcinoma appear relatively high . For instance , complete response proportion 48 % recently report perihilar cholangiocarcinoma patient receive preoperative chemoradiation follow liver transplant . Moreover , small series demonstrate superior progression free overall survival combination external beam RT chemotherapy compare derived chemotherapy alone many unresectable hepatic malignancy , include IHC , colorectal cancer liver metastasis , hepatocellular carcinoma . For example , addition external beam RT cisplatin chemotherapy associate prolonged progression free ( median 4.3 vs. 1.9 month , p=0.001 ) overall ( median 9.3 vs. 6.2 month , p=0.048 ) survival compare cisplatin alone among 92 total patient unresectable IHC . Traditional thought radiation biology tumor suggest dos least 1.2 Gy require overcome initial shoulder cell survival curve . In practice , standard dose per fraction consider 0.015-0.022 Gy per fraction although vast majority patient treat either 1.8 Gy 2 Gy fraction . Laboratory clinical data suggest new paradigm use LDFRT chemopotentiator may allow full-dose drug therapy improve efficacy without add toxicity systemic treatment . This chemopotentiating effect possible phenomenon know hyper-radiation sensitivity ( HRS ) effective tumor cell kill would predict use dos per fraction 1 Gy . This follow change slope survival response increase dos per fraction , indicate increase radioresistance ( IRR ) . This HRS phenomenon first describe Joiner colleague Gray Laboratory 1986 since well describe number laboratory . It also document clinical setting ; study Harney et al. , patient pair cutaneous metastasis sarcoma melanoma long time tumor regrowth LDFRT conventional radiation . In vitro study establish link HRS/IRR evasion early G2/M cell cycle checkpoint . Exaggerated HRS/IRR response find enriched population G2 phase cell one study , indicate mechanism likely involved event G2 phase cell cycle . Two G2 checkpoint describe , recently discover `` early '' checkpoint rapidly activate radiation exposure . It believe prevent cell cycle progression G2 cell unrepaired radiation-induced DNA damage . The signal cascade regulate early G2/M checkpoint initiate ATM activity . Joiner colleague show inhibition ChK1 Chk2 , two protein integral G2/M transition , influence cell-cycle response low-dose radiation . It believe failure cell repair DNA damage G2-phase cell lead increased apoptosis . Nonetheless , inhibition ChK1 ChK2 also lead IRR radiation dose &gt; 0.2 Gy . This consistent report indicate low dose radiation stimulate repair DNA damage . Interestingly , low dose radiation also stimulate antioxidant capacity , apoptosis , induction immune response , collectively may provide effective local tumor control . In addition , hypoxia nitric oxide level also affect cell sensitivity radiation . Reduction nitric oxide level enhances radiosensitivity hypoxic non-small cell lung cancer . Therefore , identification cellular pathway responsive low dose radiation contribution chemopotentiation highly significant provide good measurement therapeutic response contribute rational design mechanism-based clinical trial . Based promising preclinical data , clinical study perform variety cancer type LDFRT addition standard chemotherapy . Investigators University Kentucky publish experience use carboplatin paclitaxel 4 fraction 0.8 Gy locally advance head neck cancer patient . They observe toxicity similar expect chemotherapy alone conclude addition LDFRT `` extremely well tolerate . '' Moreover , report excellent response rate . Regine et al . conducted phase I trial low dose abdominal RT ( 0.6 vs. 0.7 Gy fraction , total 8 fraction ) gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 among patient unresectable pancreatic/small bowel carcinoma . The author conclude abdominal LDFRT use 0.6 Gy fraction well tolerate give concurrently full-dose gemcitabine . A multi-institutional phase II trial use regimen suggest improved efficacy combine regimen improve overall survival . Sixty-one percent enrol patient experience least stable disease , median survival poor prognosis population 13 month . More importantly , additional toxicity observe LDFRT expect high dose gemcitabine ( personal communication , manuscript preparation ) . More recently , Wrenn et al . demonstrate tolerability concomitant low-dose whole-abdominal RT full-dose cisplatin optimally debulked stage III/IV endometrial cancer patient . Currently , prospective study evaluate efficacy concomitant gem-cis RT locally advance IHC regard disease response post-operative intrahepatic disease recurrence . Prior full dose external beam RT accept contraindication liver resection due development advance fibrosis intrahepatic biliary sclerosis . However , study evaluate influence preoperative LDFRT outcomes partial hepatectomy . Case report safe liver resection antecedent radioembolization suggest LDFRT may adversely affect postoperative outcome . LDFRT entire liver portal lymph node basin advantageous compare tumor direct therapy former treat occult disease represent common site disease recurrence partial hepatectomy progression chemotherapy . Based data ABC trial establish gem-cis standard care locally advance and/or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma , primary goal phase II study explore safety efficacy use combination LDFRT chemopotentiator concurrent gem-cis mass-forming IHC . The pivotal Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer ( ABC ) Trial establish combination gemcitabine-cisplatin ( gem-cis ) therapy standard care patient locally advance and/or metastatic IHC . While majority patient experience initial disease stabilization therapy ( e.g . stable disease , partial response , complete response ) partial complete response occur approximately 20 % patient . Smaller trial comprise chemotherapeutics without anti-biologic agent report similar result . Moreover , disease stabilization short live median progression free survival six-eight month . Thus , press need effective liver direct therapy locally advanced disease .</detailed_description>
