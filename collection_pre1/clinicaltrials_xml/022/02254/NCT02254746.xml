	<brief_summary>The aim study test safety efficacy Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) localize prostate carcinoma patient standard treatment irradiation entire prostate gland without seminal vesicle accompany hormonal therapy . In light accumulate clinical evidence favoring use hypo fractionation , SBRT regimen might constitute much convenient non-invasive highly efficient outpatient therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I-II Dose Escalation Study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective phase I : To irradiate prostate gland might albeit contain microscopic disease tumoricidal dose SBRT , escalate dose SBRT visible prostatic tumor towards best tumoricidal dose without exceed normal tissue tolerance toxicity patient organ confine T2-T3 N0 prostate carcinoma . Primary objective phase II : To determine rate acute toxicity grade 2 defined toxicity occur immediately first fraction radiotherapy 90 day start radiotherapy treatment . Secondary objective phase II : - To determine efficacy measure PSA failure use Phoenix definition . - To determine long-term late toxicity ( &gt; 90 day treatment start ) . Exploratory endpoint phase II : • To determine feasibility achieve dose constraint organ risk use high technology radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
