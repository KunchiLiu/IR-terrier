	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab combination toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) agonist SD-101 radiation therapy treat patient low-grade B-cell lymphoma return . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Biological therapy , TLR9 agonist SD-101 , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill cancer cell shrink tumor . Giving ipilimumab combination TLR9 agonist SD-101 radiation therapy may better treatment B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability increase dose level intratumoral injection ipilimumab fix dose intratumoral injection SD-101 ( TLR9 agonist SD-101 ) combine local radiation patient low-grade B-cell lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine local systemic anti-tumor effect intratumoral injection ipilimumab intratumoral injection SD-101 combine local radiation patient low-grade B-cell lymphoma . II . To evaluate tumor-specific humoral cellular immune response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ipilimumab follow phase II study . Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 via intratumoral injection day 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; ipilimumab via intratumoral injection day 1 ; undergo radiation therapy day 1 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , every 3-6 month .</detailed_description>
