	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together brentuximab vedotin treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma come back ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Everolimus may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Brentuximab vedotin may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread binding protein surface cancer cell release cancer-killing substance . Giving everolimus together brentuximab vedotin may better treatment Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Brentuximab Vedotin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety optimal dose everolimus give combination brentuximab vedotin relapse refractory Hodgkin lymphoma patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy everolimus combination brentuximab vedotin relapse refractory Hodgkin lymphoma . II . To evaluate duration response , progression free survival , overall survival . III . To evaluate response positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) base response criterion . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess cytokine free light chain therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) every day ( QOD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 15 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV 30 minute day 1 everolimus PO QD every day day 1-84 1 course . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning course 17 , patient receive everolimus PO QD , QOD , twice weekly , thrice weekly day 1-84 . Courses repeat every 84 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
