	<brief_summary>Contemporary behavior intervention focus upper limb train robotic-assisted training constraint-induced movement therapy proven promote motor recovery . However , improvement often limited practical significance . Mirror therapy ( MT ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) brain base similar principle utilize brain plasticity show benefit promote motor function recovery particularly easy apply different setting . tDCS activate bulk neural circuit non-specific way , couple tDCS MT could steer plastic process toward functional direction . However , current evidence insufficient support efficacy tDCS adjuvant upper limb training , long-term effect yet explore . Cortical stimulation clearly role stroke rehabilitation . However , current evidence insufficient support efficacy tDCS adjuvant MT , long-term effect yet explore . Therefore , randomize clinical trial aim examine ( 1 ) beneficial effect hybrid therapy ( i.e. , MT tDCS ) health-related outcome patient chronic stroke ; ( 2 ) long-term benefit hybrid therapy activity participation 6-month follow-up ; ( 3 ) underlie mechanisms hybrid therapy motor control brain organization ; ( 4 ) correlation brain excitability pattern movement kinematics/health-related outcome . Accordingly , compare hybrid therapy v MT sham tDCS v MT vs conventional intervention ( CI ) motor performance , daily function , activity participation . We also examine underlie mechanism kinematic measure motor control fMRI analysis brain reorganization . The MT sham tDCS group include achieve double-blinded design ( patient evaluator blind ) MT real tDCS group . The MT group include examine exist placebo effect presence tDCS set MT sham tDCS . The CI group include provide baseline treatment see three therapy induce large improvement compare currently standard therapy . We hypothesize ( 1 ) hybrid therapy induce great improvement health-related outcome compare therapy ; ( 2 ) benefit retain 6-month follow-up ; ( 3 ) good motor control brain reorganization find hybrid therapy therapy ; ( 4 ) correlation find brain activity movement kinematics/health-related outcome . This study first investigate effect hybrid therapy , MT tDCS , chronic stroke . This study unique examine change different level include motor performance , daily function , activity participation , well brain motor organization . To address inconsistent benefit daily function outcomes previous research MT tDCS stroke rehabilitation , modify exist treatment protocol include 30-minute functional training treatment session group . The result project might unveil potentially good hybrid intervention chronic stroke population choose , compare stand alone therapy MT CI . And result also provide information change motor control brain organization help understand underlying mechanism . The follow-up examination provide information long term effect level activity participation , crucial consider chronic stroke patient likely live community . In addition , may provide critical information association brain activity movement patters/functional outcome term analyze correlation fMRI data hand kinematics/ health-related outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic stroke participant recruit Chang Gung Memorial Hospital randomly assign 1 4 group : MT+tDCS , MT+sham tDCS , MT , CI group . The participant group receive equivalent amount treatment . Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , control pretest difference , separately perform outcome measure test effect different intervention group .</detailed_description>
