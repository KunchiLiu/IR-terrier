	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well modestly reduced-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) without cisplatin work treat patient oropharyngeal cancer spread place body ( advanced ) . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether IMRT effective without cisplatin treat patient oropharyngeal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced-Dose Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy With Without Cisplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To select arm ( ) achieve 2-year progression-free survival rate &gt; = 85 % without unacceptable swallow toxicity 1 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pattern failure ( locoregional relapse versus distant ) survival ( overall progression-free ) 6 month 2 year . II . To determine acute toxicity profile end radiation therapy 1 6 month . III . To determine late toxicity profile 1 2 year . IV . To determine patient-reported swallow outcomes 6 month 1 2 year . V. To determine predictive value 12-14 week , post-treatment fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) locoregional control progression free survival ( PFS ) 2 year . VI . To determine predictive value blood tissue biomarkers disease outcomes 2 year . VII . To determine swallow recovery per videofluoroscopy image 2 year . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo IMRT daily ( QD ) five day week 6 week total dose 60 Gy receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute weekly radiation therapy 6 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo IMRT five day week 5 week total dose 60 Gy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
