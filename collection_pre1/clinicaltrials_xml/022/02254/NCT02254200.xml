	<detailed_description>Obesity commonly associate insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia , seem link impaired ability oxidize lipid , particularly class III obese individual [ Body Mass Index ( BMI ) : &gt; 40 kg*m-2 ] ( 1 ) . Exercise training effective strategy improve insulin sensitivity reduce risk type 2 diabetes ( 2 ) . It suggest 8 ( 3 ) 10 wk ( 4 ) individualize moderate exercise training program intensity ( Fatmax ) elicit maximal fat oxidation ( MFO ) may significantly increase fat oxidation rate ( FORs ) exercise ; may also increase muscle oxidative capacity overweight class I obese men . The effect individualize Fatmax train program short duration never investigate . High-intensity interval training ( Wingate-based HIIT ) show induce similar adaptation traditional training moderate intensity follow 6 wk train healthy adult despite low training volume ( 5 ) . This suggest HIIT may time-efficient alternative ( 6 ) . Recently , HIIT also report rapidly induce adaptation link improved health-related outcome sedentary overweight/obese individual ( 7 , 8 ) . This study aim compare effect two different 2-wk-long training modality [ continuous intensity elicit maximal fat oxidation ( Fatmax ) versus adapt high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) ] aerobic metabolic fitness class II III obese men . It hypothesize , nature HIIT stimulation rapid change , aerobic fitness , fat oxidation rate exercise insulin sensitivity would improve great extent train adapt HIIT compare Fatmax training . A group twenty obese men ( BMI≥35 kg*m-2 ) assign Fatmax group adapt HIIT group . Both group perform 8 cycling-sessions matched mechanical work spread 14 day [ 40-50 min continuous exercise ~60-70 % maximal heart rate ( Fatmax ) 10x60-s cycling interval ~90 % maximal heart rate intersperse 60-s recovery ( HIIT ) ] . Aerobic fitness fat oxidation rate ( FORs ) exercise assess prior follow train maximal incremental test . Blood sample also draw determine hormone plasma metabolite level . Insulin sensitivity assess homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA ) . The experimental design consist follow : 1 ) maximal ramp incremental test , determine peak power output subject . 2 ) pre train test blood sample , maximal incremental test ( Incr ) determine whole-body fat oxidation kinetics Fatmax first phase ( IncrP1 ) maximal parameter second phase ( IncrP2 ) test . 3 ) 2-wk training intervention , Fatmax HIIT 4 ) post-training test , control maximal incremental test blood sample . A 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA ( time x group x exercise intensity ) perform compare investigated variable .</detailed_description>
