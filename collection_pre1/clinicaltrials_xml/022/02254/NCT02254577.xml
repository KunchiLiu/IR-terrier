	<brief_title>Vaginal Compared Intramuscular Progesterone Frozen Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose ongoing study look whether Endometrin® ( vaginal micronized progesterone tablet ) supplement intramuscular injection progesterone oil ( PIO ) work well PIO alone woman undergo transfer frozen-thawed blastocyst ( ) . Another goal study determine whether patient prefer Endometrin PIO . Endometrin® approve United States Food Drug Administration , FDA , `` support embryo implantation early pregnancy supplementation corpus luteal function part Assisted Reproductive Technology ( ART ) treatment program infertile woman . '' ( FDA New Drug Approval Letter , Endometrin® , 2007 ) . The use Endometrin® ( vaginal micronized progesterone tablet ) study investigational . An investigational use one approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Approximately 1170 woman age 18-48 difficulty become pregnant wish undergo frozen embryo transfer ask participate . The participant recruit among patient Shady Grove Fertility . One-half participant qualify wish take part ongoing study randomize ( assigned chance , like flip coin ) receive Endometrin® intramuscular injection PIO every third day . One-half randomized receive intramuscular injection PIO every day . This study type study call `` open label , '' assessor-blind study . This mean doctor know treatment assigned receive ; however , person analyze information obtain study know patient receive study treatment . Patients enrol study receive medication freeze embryo transfer cycle free charge .</detailed_description>
