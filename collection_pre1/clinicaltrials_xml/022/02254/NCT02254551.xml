	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Study LDE225 ( Sonidegib ) Plus Bortezomib Patients With Relapsed Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although multiple myeloma ( MM ) consider fatal , survival dramatically improve introduction effective treatment option . Despite advance , patient eventually relapse MM generally consider incurable . LDE225 ( Sonidegib ) oral , investigational smoothen ( SMO ) inhibitor show anti-tumor activity certain cancer . Bortezomib highly active drug treatment MM produce response rate relapse and/or refractory patient . This study investigate tolerability feasibility combine LDE225 bortezomib patient bortezomib-sensitive relapsed relapsed/refractory MM .</detailed_description>

Received investigational drug within 28 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose LDE225 . For antineoplastic therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , target therapy radiation ) , minimum 14 day termination study drug administration LDE225 require . 4 . Patients previously treat systemic LDE225 Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway inhibitor . 5 . Received major surgical procedure within 28 day begin study drug , minor surgical procedure within 7 day . No wait require follow portacath placement . 6 . Those pregnant lactating . 7 . Patients concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study potentially affect interpretation study data . 8 . Patients &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy ( per NCI CTCAE V4.0 ) within 14 day prior study enrollment . 9 . Patients presence active gastrointestinal disease condition interfere significantly absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion oral therapy ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea Grade ≥2 , malabsorption syndrome ) . 10 . Patients neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis , HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil , discontinue least 2 week prior start LDE225 treatment . If essential patient stay statin control hyperlipidemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . 11 . Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid LDE225 treatment . 12 . Receiving treatment medication know moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 CYP3A5 , drug BCRP substrate , drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment LDE225 . Medications strong CYP3A4 CYP3A5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day prior start LDE225 . Strong CYP3A4 CYP3A5 inducer discontinue least 2 week week week prior start treatment LDE225 . 13 . Therapeutic dos warfarin sodium warfarinderivative anticoagulant permit since LDE225 competitive inhibitor CYP2C9 base vitro data . In situation therapeutic anticoagulation may accomplish use low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) similar agent . 14 . Those diagnosed cardiac condition currently within last 6 month . 15 .
