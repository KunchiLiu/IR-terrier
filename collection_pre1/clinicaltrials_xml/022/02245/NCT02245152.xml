	<brief_summary>Globally , child undernutrition underlie cause 3.1 million death child young 5 year . 18.7 million child five year age suffer severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) additional 33 million child suffer moderate acute malnutrition , risk develop SAM In Sub-Saharan Africa , often poor integration program treat child acute malnutrition program focus prevention acute chronic undernutrition - result many miss opportunity use prevention platform screen refer SAM child , use screen referral platform provide prevention service . This project address two critical gap relate integration preventive treatment program : 1 ) screening treatment MAM/SAM yet systematically integrated routine health-center visit mainstreamed community outreach program ; 2 ) screening program often offer preventive service child find suffer MAM/SAM time screen ; mother child identify non-MAM/SAM case usually send home without receive health nutrition input result , may fail come back screen see tangible benefit associate participation screen . This project specifically address gap assess effect integrate approach consist high screen coverage preventive Behavior Change Communication ( BCC ) + Small-Quantity Lipid-based Nutrient supplementation ( SQ-LNS ) prevention treatment child undernutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Integrated Prevention Treatment Child Malnutrition Health Burkina Faso : Cluster Randomized Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because intend dual role BCC/SQ-LNS child undernutrition study - e.g . help prevent child undernutrition enhance coverage screening , referral treatment SAM/MAM , necessary combine two study design rigorously evaluate impact propose intervention tease contribution prevention enhance coverage/treatment overall impact child malnutrition . The propose study therefore use two type study design . The first one repeat cross-sectional design compare select study outcomes intervention control group endline , 24 month program implementation . A repeated cross-sectional study design among child 0-17 month , baseline study endline ( different child ) use assess impact intervention prevalence several outcome , include prevalence MAM/SAM stunting , coverage MAM/SAM screen maternal ENA/IYCF/WASH knowledge practice . The second propose study design entail longitudinal design whereby individual child recruit birth followed-up monthly reach 18 month age . We anticipate need approximately 5 month recruit require number child ( estimate 2,040- 1,020 control group 1,020 intervention group ) . This design allow u assess intervention 's effect incidence , recovery recurrence rate MAM/SAM .</detailed_description>
