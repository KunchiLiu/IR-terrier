	<brief_summary>The aim research study vitamin D affect various aspect disease process , inflammation , coagulation ( ADAMTS13 WVF ) miRNAs , Diabetic kidney disease hemodialysis patient . Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) one common chronic disease nearly country . Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) traditionally refer diabetic nephropathy one microvascular complication diabetes . Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) occur 25 % -40 % patient diabetes . Some study show high risk cardiovascular disease diabetic patient nephropathy associate increase plasma level von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) decrease ADAMTS13 level . VWF glycoprotein play important role platelet thrombus formation , whereas ADAMTS13 proteolytic enzyme responsible degradation large multimers VWF release plasma endothelial cell platelet . Patients chronic kidney disease diabetes show high plasma level VWF decrease ADAMTS13 activity compare healthy control . Increased plasma level VWF , reflect damage endothelial cell hypercoagulability state , report atherosclerosis diabetes . Thus , VWF ADAMTS13 seem important player interface diabetic nephropathy , hypercoagulability atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . Vitamin D deficiency risk factor DM hypertension . The investigator previous study show add calcitriol ( activate vitamin D ) endothelial vascular smooth muscle cell significantly down-regulated inflammatory response gene protein expression involve nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activate B cell ( NFÄ¸B ) signal transduction pathway . Micro RNA ( miRNA ) short noncoding RNAs , 22-25 nucleotide long . As endogenous production transcript , miRNAs bind 3 untranslated region ( 3 UTR ) target messenger RNA ( mRNA ) imperfect , complementary manner , lead post-transcriptional gene silence . As result , miRNAs inhibit gene expression via mRNA degradation , translation inhibition , transcriptional inhibition.The critical role miRNAs establish several cellular biologic process , proliferation , differentiation , development , regulation gene relate immune response , cancer , insulin secretion . MiRNA involve various biological process become novel biomarkers , modulators therapeutic target diseases cancer , atherosclerosis , DM . Significance : The high prevalence cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient DM chronic hemodialysis remain significant clinical problem find potential new biomarkers investigate . This study aim establish link ADAMTS13 , VWF miRNA expression vitamin D level contribute development new treatment hemodialysis patient diabetes . Methods : Each hemodialysis patient diabetes investigator institute ask participate study . After explain research goal , patient agree participate sign inform consent . The investigator estimate study include 70 patient . Each patient assess physician 4 vial blood take patient connect dialysis machine . The blood send laboratory check : 1 ) chemistry ; 2 ) 1-25 vitamin D 25- vitamin D level ; 3 ) ADAMTS13 activity VWF ; 4 ) miRNA extraction . The patient group accord vitamin D level ( deficient /sufficient ) , ADAMTS13 , VWF miRNA expression compare group .</brief_summary>
