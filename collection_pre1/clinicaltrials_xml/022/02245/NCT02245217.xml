	<criteria>Patients must either 1. histologically/cytologicallyconfirmed borderline resectable pancreatic cancer prescribe neoadjuvant gemcitabineplusAbraxane part standard care 2. histologically/cytologicallyconfirmed locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer prescribe neoadjuvant gemcitabineplusAbraxane part standard care . Diagnostic quality abdominal imaging ( CT MRI ) within past 45 day . Patients must 18 year old inclusion research study . There little experience safety [ 18F ] FLT child therefore radiopharmaceutical use patient age 18 . Patients must willing lie flat back PET/CT scanner 2 hour allow image data obtain . Patients must document willingness follow 24 month follow enrollment image trial . By sign informed consent , patient document agreement clinical radiographic endpoint result histopathologic tissue analysis laboratory information enter research database . All patient must sign write informed consent HIPAA authorization accordance institutional guideline . Determination pregnancy status : Female patient postmenopausal surgically sterile undergo serum pregnancy test prior baseline subsequent set multitracer PET scan . The serum pregnancy test must perform within 48 hour prior research PET imaging . A negative test necessary patient undergo research PET imaging . ECOG Performance Status 02 . Adequate organ function laboratory parameter define laboratory testing . Any prior systemic investigational therapy pancreatic cancer . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical ( patient significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion ) . Patients pregnant lactate suspect might pregnant . Serum pregnancy test obtain prior baseline subsequent multitracer PET scan female patient postmenopausal surgically sterile . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET scanning . Patients know HIV positive . This due potential toxicity [ 18F ] FLT HIV positive patient . Preexisting sensory neuropathy great grade 1 . Prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer form cancer patient diseasefree 5 year . Uncontrolled diabetes blood glucose great than180 mg/dl day [ 18F ] FDGPET scan . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery . Any condition would , Investigator 's judgment , contraindicate patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure , e.g . infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , social complication .</criteria>
