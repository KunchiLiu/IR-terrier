	<brief_title>Effect CPAP Treatment Glycemic Control Gestational Diabetes : A Pilot Randomized-Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes ( GDM ) , define glucose intolerance first recognize pregnancy , associate adverse maternal fetal outcome . Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) characterize breathe pause sleep lead recurrent arousal intermittent hypoxia . The result increase sympathetic drive , cortisol inflammation show lead glucose dysregulation . In SDB prevalent pregnancy , SDB may represent novel risk factor GDM , suggest recent observational study . No interventional study evaluate effect SDB treatment GDM outcomes yet publish . General Objective : To perform pilot study assess feasibility conduct randomized-controlled trial use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) evaluate effect SDB treatment maternal-fetal outcome GDM . Primary Aim Pilot Study : 1 ) To assess CPAP adherence pregnant patient GDM . Secondary Aims : 2 ) To assess recruitment retention rate ~2 month treatment 3 ) To assess adequacy nasal dilator strip control intervention 4 ) To measure maternal glucose level determine sample size calculation future large-scale multi-site randomized-controlled trial .</detailed_description>
