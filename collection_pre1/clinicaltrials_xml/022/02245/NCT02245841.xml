	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety H.P . Acthar Gel Treatment Refractory Cutaneous Manifestations Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult juvenile dermatomyositis ( DM ) systemic immune-mediated inflammatory disease commonly affect skin musculoskeletal system . Amyopathic dermatomyositis subtype dermatomyositis affect skin lack characteristic muscle involvement . Treatment condition , particular cutaneous manifestation , challenge currently universally effective single treatment exists . Many patient cutaneous manifestation refractory numerous medication . H.P . Acthar gel ( adrenocorticotropic hormone gel ) receive FDA approval treatment variety disease , include dermatomyositis , 1952 . Despite paucity clinical data concern efficacy H.P . Acthar gel treat dermatomyositis . Recently small , retrospective case series describe significant improvement cutaneous musculoskeletal symptom 5 patient refractory dermatomyositis treat H.P . Acthar gel report result renew interest use medication dermatomyositis patient ( reference ) . The propose efficacy H.P . Acthar gel attribute unique ability induce production endogenous cortisol , corticosterone , aldosterone , bind melanocortin receptor lymphocytes cell modulate immunologic response .</detailed_description>
