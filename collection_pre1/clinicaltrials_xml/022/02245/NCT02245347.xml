	<brief_summary>Drug resistant tuberculosis grow problem world wide . The current method diagnosis time consume may delay diagnosis treatment many week . In study investigator wish take sputum sample patient see investigator validate molecular DNA base process prompt identification drug resistant tuberculosis . The investigator wish extract amplify DNA drug resistant tuberculosis identify gene within confer resistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drug resistant M. tuberculosis increase problem United Kingdom abroad . In United Kingdom ( UK ) whole number isolates show resistant least one first line drug nearly 400 , total number isolates approach 5000 . A total 9040 case report UK 2009 6.9 % demonstrate resistance least one first line drug ( 1 ) . In certain population incidence drug resistance high : London , homeless patient , prison certain country abroad , particularly Eastern Europe . The difficulty drug resistant tuberculosis treatment duration , cost complexity increase . Typically patient treatment 18 month Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) estimate cost upto Â£50000 . Current diagnosis rest culture M. tuberculosis drug sensitivity test . This take six eight week , mean patient may ineffective therapy time , lead transmission deterioration patient 's clinical condition . In study investigator would hope develop new test improve expedite diagnosis multi- drug resistant MDR TB . The predominant mechanism resistance occur M. tuberculosis development selection mutant contain single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP 's ) ( 2 ) . Present commercial assay enable common subset ( 5-10 ) ( 900+ ) document resistance mutation detect ( www.tbdreamdb.com ) . It highly likely many exist particularly region genome may modulate sensitivity resistance . This complexity compound requirement treat TB cocktails antibiotic even fully drug sensitive M.tuberculosis treatment consist isoniazid ( H ) , rifampicin ( R ) , pyrazinamide ( Z ) ethambutol ( E ) . Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) TB case treat second line drug moxifloxacin , amikacin , capreomycin , para-aminosalicylic acid ( PAS ) , thiocetazone others genotypic marker resistance test . Such complex treatment combination increase need screen multiple gene target imperative treat immediately correct combination antibiotic . The large number mutation make exhaustive detection know SNP 's impossible exist diagnostic procedure . Whole genome sequence offer potential interrogate genome clinical isolates M. tuberculosis know mutation infer antimicrobial sensitivity pattern . The extensive cost treat manage MDR case ( 3 ) could potentially reduce obtain rapid genomic resistance profile early within patient treatment . Cost benefit analysis immediate whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) TB case would highly beneficial financially well clinically . The investigator propose conduct limit pilot study ass potential acquire whole genome sequence directly sputum specimen , early patient 's treatment retrospectively define potential impact availability data patient care . This proposal thus provide evidence base WGS develop routine diagnostic test/process medical potential local National Health Service ( NHS ) level globally improve care pathway MDR XDR TB .</detailed_description>
