Lignocaine Bupivacaine ( LiB ) mixtures procedure Lignocaine 2 % bupivacaine 0.5 % procure locally , supplier license approved national drug authority ( NDA ) , within expiry date . The 4-4-2 mix 4cc Lignocaine 2 % , 4cc 0.5 % bupivacaine 2cc water injection , draw 10cc syringe . The 3-3-4 mix 3cc Lignocaine 2 % , 3cc bupivacaine 0.5 % 4 cc water injection . We assign participant two group ( group alternative week ) . We administer additional local analgesia experience break-through pain procedure . We record mix ratio , time procedure commence end use stop clock , presence break-through pain SMC , pain 30 60 minute SMC ( post-operative ) . We encourage client report pain visual analogue score ( VAS ) pain chart use estimate pain intensity . Post-operative pain grade mild VAS score 0-5 , moderate score 6-8 severe 9-10 . We monitor client recovery room additional post-operative pain oral analgesia give need . Other adverse event : participant observed central nervous system ( CNS ) toxicity , convulsion , coma respiratory depression cardiovascular system ( CVS ) toxicity Bradycardia pulse rate &lt; 60bpm ( beat per minute )</detailed_description>
