	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine tolerance , safety , pharmokinetics , possible clinical benefit good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) -grade amyloid fibril-reactive chimeric ( Ch ) IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 patient amyloid light-chain ( AL ) amyloidosis . The phase 1a part involve least 3 patient maximum 18 patient . The first patient receive start dose antibody , tolerate , follow patient receive ( tolerate ) progressively high dos antibody . Patients part 1a trial receive one infusion drug . Patients treat phase 1a part receive low dosage might effective . Once maximal tolerate dosage establish phase 1a part , investigator accrue patient phase 1b part trial . Patients receive 4 infusion , week 4 week . Patients treat part 1a trial show toxicity also treat part 1b trial . The first patient receive start dose antibody , tolerate , follow patient receive ( tolerate ) progressively high dos antibody . When investigator reach maximum tolerated dose without toxicity , investigator e enroll another 4 patient receive dose . If toxicity , another 4 patient treat next dose level , forth . Patients treat Phase 1b may receive low dosage might effective . The goal Phase 1b establish tolerance possible beneficial effect 11-1F4 . If successful , treatment antibody would represent novel approach care individual AL amyloidosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Presently , treatment patient amyloid light chain ( AL ) amyloidosis limit reduce production amyloid-forming light-chain protein give conventional high-dose ( stem cell transplant ) anti-plasma cell chemotherapy , use patient multiple myeloma . Although approach extend survival , prognosis remain poor due persistence progression amyloid deposit vital organ , heart kidney . A different treatment strategy would attempt reduce and/or eliminate deposit . This study evaluate administer anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody , 11-1F4 . This compound show reduce/destroy material experimental animal model amyloidosis .</detailed_description>
