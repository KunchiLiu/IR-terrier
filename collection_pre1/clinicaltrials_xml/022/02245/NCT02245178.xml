	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) third lead cause death United States . Although smoke major risk factor COPD , minority smoker develop COPD . Markers predict risk future COPD young adult would valuable target risk reduction strategy identify subclinical disease . Although COPD classically define obstructive lung physiology , many individual , include smoker , spirometric restrictive physiology . Reduced lung function , whether manifest COPD restriction , associate adverse cardiovascular outcome . Our long-term goal identify subclinical manifestation COPD lung disease explore heart lung disease co-exist . This ancillary study Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) cohort study 's year 30 examination . We add pre- post-bronchodilator spirometry exam evaluate lung parenchymal vascular structure cardiac CT scan year 25 . Informed preliminary data document marker systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction associate subsequent lung function decline young adult , lung function decline young adult associate incident hypertension , divergence cardiac structure function depend pattern lung function decline , propose follow specific aim : ( 1 ) To evaluate factor young adult predict incident COPD and/or restriction ; ( 2 ) To determine whether incident COPD incident restriction associate distinct cardiac structural functional change ; ( 3 ) To determine lung structural intrathoracic vascular change associate incident COPD incident restriction . We test hypothesis early life marker systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction associate risk subsequent lung disease explore whether different inflammatory marker predict different lung phenotype . We evaluate cardiac structural change associate different lung phenotype evaluate lung structural pulmonary vascular alteration may explain concurrently evolve cardiovascular finding associate develop lung disease . These study describe subclinical manifestation lung disease , identify marker predict risk future lung disease , expand understand heart-lung interaction evolve health young adult disease middle age .</detailed_description>
