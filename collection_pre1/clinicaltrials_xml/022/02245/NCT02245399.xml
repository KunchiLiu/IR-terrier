	<brief_title>Canola-Mediterranean Diet Study T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan assess effect increase canola oil plant protein food reduce carbohydrate intake context Mediterranean type diet weight loss , glycemic control cardiovascular risk factor type 2 diabetes . Obesity rate Western nation show dramatic rise last 20 year diabetes rate double , trend predict repeat next 20 year . In Canada predict cost healthcare system 7 year rise $ 17 billion . Weight loss diet ( Atkins , Eddies , South Beach Zone ) emphasize carbohydrate restriction become increasingly popular prevention treatment diabetes . As result , low carbohydrate diet select health conscious member general population include diabetes . Because diet effect promote high intake protein animal source , even presence weight loss , serum cholesterol level rise due increase cholesterol saturate fat intake ; rise serum lipid likely occur long term weight loss cease . On hand , low carbohydrate dietary pattern higher plant rather animal fat protein associate improved blood lipid reduce risk heart disease type 2 diabetes . The investigator therefore plan study weight reduce low carbohydrate , Mediterranean type diet high plant protein canola oil compare weight reduce high cereal fibre diet 3 month study . 150 overweight obese participant type 2 diabetes randomize one 2 treatment . Study visit follow : week -2 , 0 ( randomization ) , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 12 . Body measurement , blood pressure blood sample take visit except week 2 . The week 2 visit mainly reinforcement dietary advice ; also body weight measure blood drawn fast glucose HbA1c . Diet record review visit . 24 hour urine sample collect week 0 week 12 . On completion 12 week study , participant give option continue diet try opposite diet 12 week . Visits every 4 week total 3 visit . Body measurement , blood pressure blood sample take visit initial 12 week study .</detailed_description>
