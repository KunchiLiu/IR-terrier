	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor DNA Predicting Outcomes Patients With Stage IV Head Neck Cancer Stage III-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate predictive value circulate tumor DNA disease-free survival/progression-free survival patient advanced head neck carcinoma ( HNC ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate level plasma tumor DNA salivary tumor DNA . II . To correlate mutation find circulate tumor DNA mutation tumor tissue . III . To evaluate association presence absence circulate tumor DNA mutation tumor burden assess use radiological finding pre-treatment fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) -derived metric : metabolic tumor volume ( MTV ) , maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) , total glycolytic activity ( TGA ) . IV . To quantify tumor-specific exosomes plasma . V. To evaluate utility cancer-derived exosomes serve prognostic biomarkers real-time monitoring therapeutic efficacy identify early recurrence use longitudinal sample cancer patient undergoing treatment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood sample collection within 1 month surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ; within 1 week surgical resection ( patient upfront surgery ) ; within 1 month begin post-operative radiation therapy ( patient upfront surgery ) ; second week radiation therapy , last week radiation therapy ; 1 3 month radiation therapy every 3 month 18 month . Patients also undergo saliva sample collection within 1 month surgery , radiation therapy , chemoradiation therapy , system chemotherapy tissue collection time surgery ( upfront surgery indicate ) . Blood , saliva , tissue sample analyze tumor mutation via next generation sequencing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients older 18 year age 2 . Diagnosis advance HNC ( Stage III , IVA , IVB , IVC ) NSCLC ( Stage IIA , IIB , IIIA , IIIB , IV ) ( patient synchronous advanced HNC NSCLC eligible ) 3 . ECOG performance status score 03 4 . Life expectancy 3 month longer 5 . Patients able provide write informed consent prior study entry 1 . Prior chemotherapy radiotherapy present advance HNC NSCLC 2 . Patients exclude history malignancy patient diseasefree less 2 year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin 3 .
