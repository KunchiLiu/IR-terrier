	<brief_summary>Aim : To evaluate dolutegravir ( DTG ) pharmacokinetics pregnant HIV-infected woman Rationale : In develop country many woman present new HIV diagnosis late pregnancy , high risk transmit infection delivery . Moreover , woman may acquire NNRTI resistance primary transmission , use nevirapine ( NVP ) previous pregnancy . In circumstance , DTG likely effective reduce mother child transmission HIV NNRTI-based regimen . Study design : HIV positive pregnant woman present untreated HIV infection late ( ≥28 -36 week gestation ) pregnancy randomise 1:1 receive DTG ( 50mg daily ) standard care ( nevirapine efavirenz ) + 2 NRTIs . PK ( 0-24h ) profile sample third trim post-partum . Although primarily PK study ( power ) randomisation include allow comparison plasma HIV VL responses standard care ( NVP EFV ) essential evaluation secondary endpoint safety efficacy DTG pregnancy .

	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics Dolutegravir Pregnant HIV Mothers Their Neonates : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) pregnancy able effectively reduce mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV . If untreated , risk transmission around 25 % ( great high viral load ) ART administer optimally pregnancy may reduce risk 1-2 % . In order successfully prevent infection , ART start first second trimester , reduce maternal plasma viral load undetectable level . Unfortunately throughout low-middle income country , MTCT rate unacceptably high estimate 430 000 newborn child infect annually . The main cause undiagnosed late diagnosis maternal infection , suboptimal adherence therapy drug resistance , particularly mother previously receive single dose nevirapine . In sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , woman frequently engage health service late pregnancy , new HIV diagnose third trimester ( ≥28 week pregnancy ) uncommon . Risk MTCT high , especially NNRTI-based therapy take median 2 month significantly reduce HIV viral load , make unlikely commencement drug late pregnancy offer protection infant intrapartum transmission . Vertical transmission HIV remain significant challenge develop country antiretroviral prophylaxis PMTCT important tool towards elimination paediatric infection . Between 2009 2010 , coverage antiretroviral prophylaxis prevention mother child transmission 42 % estimate 1.48 million infant born woman live HIV ( WHO 2010 ) . Global effort gear towards improve access antiretrovirals PMTCT simplify antiretroviral treatment protocol ensure optimal outcome HIV-infected woman child ( WHO 2010 ; WHO 2012 ) . Under consolidated antiretroviral guideline issue WHO 2013 , efavirenz-based ART recommend preferred NNRTI option HIV-1 infect patient , include among woman childbearing age pregnant woman ( WHO 2013 ) . In 2012 , Uganda adopt Option B+ strategy PMTCT HIV . Under strategy , lifelong ART offer pregnant ART naïve woman irrespective CD4 count efavirenz-based ART prefer treatment option . However , effectiveness regimen could compromise event large population woman may either exposed single dose nevirapine past among woman transmit NNRTI resistance . The justification study DTG pregnancy include : 1 . Likely widespread availability generic DTG come year . The manufacturer indicate willingness make DTG available low income country , currently engage generic manufacturer . Estimates Clinton Foundation suggest generic manufacture DTG make drug affordable either alternative first line , else second line agent ( Hill 2013 ) . Clinical guideline US Europe currently rank INSTIs raltegravir elvitegravir alongside NNRTIs prefer first line agent . INSTIs may replace NNRTIs first line regimen due good safety toxicity profile , low propensity drug interaction , superior efficacy . Large phase III RCTs compare raltegravir ( Rockstroh , Dejesus et al . 2013 ) , elvitegravir ( Sax , DeJesus et al . 2012 ) dolutegravir ( van Lunzen , Maggiolo et al . 2012 ) efavirenz-based therapy show superior virological outcome 48 week , fast time undetectable viral load , low incidence adverse event , few treatment discontinuation , finding recently confirm meta-analysis ( Messiaen , Wensing et al . 2013 ) . 2 . Low risk serious drug-drug interaction . The potential drug-drug interaction significantly less INSTIs compare antiretrovirals ( relative risk compare raltegravir : boosted protease inhibitor [ RR = 4.96 ] , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ RR = 2.48 ] ( Patel , Abdelsayed et al . 2011 ) . These particularly important consideration low/middle income country setting adult newly diagnose HIV infection often present tuberculosis , antenatal screening late pregnancy . Here DTG may carry significant advantage NNRTIs , INSTIs . In absence alternative rifampicin-based TB therapy , DTG raltegravir exposure moderately reduce ( Dooley , Sayre et al . 2013 ) , compare large ( 50-90 % ) reduction concentration boost PIs , nevirapine elvitegravir . Dolutegravir metabolized glucuronidation ( UGT1A1 ) contribution CYP3A . 3 . Rapid viral load drop potentially beneficial late diagnosis pregnancy . In Sub-Saharan Africa , pregnant mother tend engage health service later pregnancy compare Europe , new HIV diagnose result universal test ≥28w gestation frequent . DTG result rapid reduction viral load ; median time undetectable viral load SINGLE study 28 day vs. 84 day Atripla ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) ( Walmsley , Antela et al . 2012 ) . Use DTG may lower risk mother-to-child transmission HIV late presenter . Although meta-analysis show increase birth defect maternal efavirenz ( Ford , Mofenson et al . 2010 ) , recent suspicion neurological toxicity large French registry ( Sibiude , Madelbrot et al . 2013 ) neurodevelopmental delay South African cohort ( Westreich , Rubel et al . 2010 ) 4 . Proven efficacy patient establish drug resistance antiretrovirals . In resource-poor setting , option anti-retroviral therapy limit ( 2011 ) , emergence HIV drug resistance give cause concern ( Hedt , Wadonda-Kabondo et al . 2008 ; WHO 2012 ) . In cross-sectional study conduct among HIV-1 antiretroviral naïve patient five African country , high prevalence transmit resistance observe Kampala , Uganda 12.3 % ( 22 179 ; 7.5-17.1 ) ( Hamers , Wallis et al . 2011 ) . In Malawi , prevalence primary drug resistance new infection 6.1 % comparable figure ~3 % South Africa ( Manasa , Katzenstein et al . 2012 ) , 5.7 % Zambia ( Hamers , Siwale et al . 2010 ) , half mutation confer resistance non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase ( NNRTI ) ( Wadonda-Kabondo , Banda et al . 2012 ) . Studies across Africa show treatment response NNRTIs mother child expose nevirapine ( particularly single dose ) pregnancy blunt ( Musiime , Ssali et al . 2009 ) . In context , novel class ARV safe , affordable effective urgent need 5 . Safety profile pregnancy . DTG classify FDA pregnancy Category B . There adequate well-controlled study pregnant woman . Because animal reproduction study always predictive human response , dolutegravir show cross placenta animal study , manufacturer recommends drug use pregnancy clearly need ( ViiV 2013 ) . 6 . Necessity investigate DTG PK pregnant woman . Alongside clinical humanitarian imperative provide effective treatment prevent HIV transmission pregnant mother NNRTI-resistant HIV , equally important ethical imperative establish safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics DTG pregnant mother breastfed infant SSA , especially give implementation WHO Option B+ , potential widespread use DTG forseeable future . Previous experience suggest universally case pregnant woman SSA receive new antiretrovirals ( ARV ) ahead proper evaluation , clinical study ( undertaken ) occur much later stage many mother infant expose . 7 . Importance undertaking study SSA . Any pivotal study undertaken developed country would limited generalizability African setting ) ARVs tend initiate later gestation newly present pregnant woman , ii ) standard care across SSA likely efavirenz nevirapine-based regimen iii ) infant breastfeed recommend presence ARVs ii ) host factor BMI , ethnicity etc may impact pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ARVs . 8 . Continued administration DTG 2 week post-partum ( whilst breastfeed ) characterize PK non-pregnant state . Under standard care , infant receive 6 week nevirapine syrup , would expose NNRTI/NRTI/NRTI combination receive mother standard care . In study , infant expose DTG via breastmilk 2 week period follow birth . We believe risk acceptable give potential benefit . Furthermore , risk unlikely exceed potential risk utero exposure DTG . Drug-drug interaction directly administer NVP DTG ingest via breastmilk unlikely clinical significance , although study . The potential risk breastfeed few give formula feed two week period mother continue receive DTG postpartum . Replacement breast feed formula feed first two week post-partum would unethical due loss immune benefit colostrum neonate , risk intrinsic formula feed low resource setting increase risk HIV transmission mix feeding occurs ( Teasdale et al , 2011 ) The potential risk low-level ARV cause drug-resistance infant PMTCT fail exist standard care NNRTIs NRTIs ; anticipate DTG carry great risk nevertheless best monitor within clinical trial set widespread uptake without monitoring . Study Design Open label randomize trial DTG late pregnancy . HIV+ pregnant woman ( untreated ≥28w gestation randomize 1:1 receive DTG-based regimen compare standard care ( regimen contain INSTI ) .</detailed_description>
