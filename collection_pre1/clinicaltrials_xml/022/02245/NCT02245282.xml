	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer detection disease progression monitoring relies systematic multi-core biopsy . Minimal invasive imaging capacity lesion target monitoring badly need . The purpose study determine new MRI technique identify prostate lesion monitor prostate disease progression . If biopsy core number reduce small one , frequency biopsy repeat reduce . The new technique new way analyze picture take part prostate MRI exam . This part call dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI . It involve injection contrast reagent ( dye ) arm vein time period prostate MRI picture continuously take .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced MRI Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study perform contrast-enhanced ( CE ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) OHSU subject suspicious prostate lesion subject diagnosed prostate cancer . This pilot project study 20 subject prior next schedule clinical procedure ( biopsy radical prostatectomy ) . Data project use explore new capability software platform develop current SBIR funding . CE-MRI involve use extracellular ( Gadolinium base , Gd ) contrast agent . When Gd use , ( dynamic-contrast-enhanced ) DCE-MRI signal intensity time-course data analyze analytically use call `` shutter-speed '' paradigm take account effect finite water exchange kinetics . Region interest ( ROI ) high resolution ( ~millimeter ) parametric map pathophysiologic quantity , tumor vessel permeability , tumor perfusion , extracellular extravascular volume fraction , generate DCE-MRI data . All parameter compare literature result software validation correlate pathology clinical potential .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men , age &gt; 18 year . Any patient schedule prostate biopsy radical prostatectomy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients would normally exclude undergo MRI examination patient pacemaker , aneurysm clip condition would warrant avoidance strong magnetic field . Patients unable cooperate MRI exam . Major surgery within month enrollment . Prostate biopsy six week prior enrollment . Subjectreported reaction gadolinium contrast reagent .</criteria>
