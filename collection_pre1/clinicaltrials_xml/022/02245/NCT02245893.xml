	<brief_summary>This study evaluate fracture healing , anatomic reduction return function patient unstable Weber C type fracture ankle . Best outcomes obtain good alignment ankle joint maintain natural function syndesmosis ( space tibia fibula bone ) restore . The syndesmosis ankle joint stabilize series ligament often damage Weber C type fracture . Current syndesmosis repair technique traverse tibia fibula , anatomically reconstruct ligament . The investigator compare reconstruction unstable syndesmosis open reduction internal fixation use syndesmosis screw couple anterior ligament ( AiTFL ) anatomic repair technique ( ART ) percutaneous repair use syndemosis screw ( SCREW ) . Radiographic , pain functional outcome score compare group use validated outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Pilot Study Compare Open Versus Percutaneous Syndesmosis Repair Unstable Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High ankle fracture involve fracture fibula level syndesmosis ( space tibia fibula bone ) result indirect mechanism ( e.g . pronation-external rotation ( twist ) injury . The method injury assume disrupt one syndesmotic ligament , lead instability ankle mortise . High ankle fracture comprise significant proportion ankle injury ( 16 45 % ankle fracture pattern ) . It generally agree operative intervention ankle injury indicate case instability . However , recent advance understand biomechanics ankle give rise particular area clinical uncertainty , include treatment unstable syndesmotic injury reliability strictly radiographic assessment ankle fracture . The goal operative treatment anatomically reduce ankle mortise permit syndesmosis ligament heal restoration normal tibiofibular joint dynamic . Even 1 mm displacement lateral shift talus affect ankle joint load lead dysfunction potentially degenerative joint change . Accurate reduction syndesmosis maintenance reduce position ligament heal crucial ensure good outcome avoid long term arthritic change tibiofibular joint . If ankle joint unstable ( much sideways movement ) , syndesmosis space two bone ankle ( tibia fibula ) need stabilize . One method treat unstable syndesmosis injury make incision expose ankle provide direct visualization fracture anatomic reduction ( alignment ) insertion one two syndesmosis screw maintain relationship fibula tibia . This refer open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) . Another method repair close reduction ankle joint use one two percutaneous syndesmosis screw . That , syndesmosis stabilization do percutaneously use intraoperative fluoroscopy visualize repair . Literature standard practice support method . The syndesmosis joint complex compose anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament ( AiTFL ) , posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament ( PiTFL ) interosseous membrane ( IOM ) . This complex believe permit ankle mortise stability flexibility due elasticity ligament , allow intermalleolar distance change facilitate tibial fibular rotation . It also maintain axis balance loading foot fibula . Adequate stability anatomic restoration syndesmosis joint complex vital restore normal tibiotalar contact force order lessen risk posttraumatic arthritis . Clinical study show anatomic reduction PiTFL provide accurate reduction ankle mortise percutaneous reduction ORIF fixation PiTFL show biomechanical clinical study provide great stability syndesmotic screw alone . However , due mechanism injury , AiTFL initial may lateral ligamentous stabilize structure compromise syndesmotic injury . Kinematically , ligament provide roughly half strength syndesmosis act vital primary restraint excessive fibular displacement . The remainder stability believe come bony restraint posterior malleolus PiTFL . As , direct reconstruction AiTFL component syndesmosis joint may accurately restore syndesmotic stability . Current syndesmosis repair technique traverse tibia fibula ( trans syndesmotic repair ) , anatomically reconstruct AiTFL . Although known accurate reduction syndesmosis essential good outcome , current treatment may malreduction rate great 40 % . In light exist model syndesmosis injury , investigator ' understand importance syndesmosis reduction , may restoration AiTFL may potentially unlock high rate anatomic reduction positive outcome . Cadaveric clinical study demonstrate flexible trans-osseous fixation technique may viable may improve ligamentous healing . However , current flexible technique may provide adequate stability may reduce rate malreduction compare screw fixation . The investigator recently conduct biomechanical study lab use cadaveric ankle . The investigator compare whether technique syndesmosis repair concentrate restoration AiTFL ligament ( Anatomic repair technique ART ) provide anatomic reconstruction syndesmosis joint rigid screw posterior malleolus fixation . The investigator ' finding demonstrate anatomic repair technique ( ART ) offer repair sufficiently stable compare screw fixation , low incidence malreduction visualize CT scan . The investigator research suggest ORIF repair AiTFL addition stability provide syndesmotic screw repair enhance syndesmosis stability substantially , AiTFL primary stabilizer external rotation force . In word , fix anterior ligament may provide good outcome faster return function . Further vivo test require evaluate ART repair unstable syndesmosis injury .</detailed_description>
