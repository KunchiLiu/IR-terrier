	<brief_summary>The overall objective investigate efficacy resveratrol modulate metabolism CVD risk profile patient COPD . The primary objective investigate effect resveratrol CRP clinical marker low grade systemic inflammation . The secondary objective investigate effect resveratrol body composition , inflammatory status mechanistic marker blood , adipose muscle tissue well comprehensive assessment metabolicand physical performance profile know affect low grade systemic inflammation resveratrol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resveratrol In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients ( CARMENS-trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In general population cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality well establish obesity ( body mass index &gt; 30 kg/mÂ² ) important determinant . The risk even increase COPD , due smoke behaviour accumulation visceral fat combine decreased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity . Enhanced systemic inflammation identify important driver recent epidemiological translational research . Aerobic exercise training ( AET ) establish way improve metabolic health decrease CVD risk overweight general population modulate potential limited COPD due ventilatory limitation related disease symptom . Interventions mimic effect AET therefore consider unmet medical need . Evidence emerge nutritional supplement resveratrol interest candidate require investigation COPD . Study design : Proof-of-concept randomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial 4 week . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Subjects may confront certain inconvenience risk . Subjects ask wear accelerometer two time one week . During entire study period subject visit MUMC+ 2 time various non-invasive measurement ( questionnaire , anthropometry , physical function test ) well minor invasive procedure ( venous blood sample muscle fat biopsy ) cause local haematoma afterwards . However , patient inform metabolic cardiovascular health , expect positively affect intervention . In addition , patient receive lifestyle advice tailor health status .</detailed_description>
