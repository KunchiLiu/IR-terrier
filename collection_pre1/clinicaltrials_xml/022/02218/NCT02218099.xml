	<detailed_description>This two-part study . Part 1 compare pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) safety tolerability ASP8232 healthy subject subject different degree renal impairment ; Part 2 multiple-dose , placebo-controlled study evaluate PK , PD safety tolerability multiple dos ASP8232 T2DM subject CKD . Part 1 : Subjects reside clinic 9 day , receive single oral dose ASP8232 Day 1 fast condition follow 168-hours blood urine PK/PD sampling period . Subjects discharge Day 8 return clinic Days 10 , 12 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 42 collection blood PK/PD sample . An End Study Visit ( ESV ) take place last PK sample collect Day 56 . Part 2 : Subjects admit clinic Day -2 order collect PD urine sample dose begin Day 1 . Subjects receive multiple oral dos ASP8232 placebo 28 day . They discharge Day 8 return clinic Days 14 21 , Days 27 29 blood PK/PD urine PD sample . An ESV take place 14 28 day last PK/PD sample collect .</detailed_description>
