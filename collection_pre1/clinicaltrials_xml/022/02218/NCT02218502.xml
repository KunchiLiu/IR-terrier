	<brief_summary>This study perform compare diagnostic performance cost-effectiveness different diagnostic method differentiate benign malignant adnexal ( ovary Fallopian tube ) mass : Risk Malignancy Index ( RMI ) compare two-step triage test call `` simple ultrasound-based rule '' supplement -if necessary- either subjective assessment expert sonographer Diffusion Weighted - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DW-MRI ) . The investigator test hypothesis two-step triage test well diagnostic accuracy RMI therefore improve management woman adnexal mass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Into New Diagnostic Tool ( Simple Ultrasound-based Rules ) Patients With Adnexal Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Estimating whether adnexal mass malignant essential preoperative management adnexal mass . Recognizing cancer mean treatment delayed appropriate stag debulking surgery carry referral specialized surgical center . Vice versa , benign lesion may manage conservatively minimal invasive surgery non-centre hospital . This limit morbidity avoid unnecessary cost : laparoscopic surgery offer lower estimate blood loss , short hospital stay , few postoperative complication improve quality life faster return normal functioning . There several method distinguish benign malignant adnexal mass . The commonly use method clinical practice Risk Malignancy Index ( RMI ) . The RMI easy use score system recommend many national guideline concern management ovarian mass , include national guideline Netherlands . The RMI combine ultrasound variable , menopausal status serum CA125 score use predict risk ovarian cancer surgery . However , report sensitivity specificity RMI cut-off value 200 relatively low ; 75-80 % 85-90 % , respectively . Another method call 'simple ultrasound-based rule ' ( simple rule ) , use different morphological ultrasound feature adnexal mass ( without include menopausal status serum CA125 measurement ) . It include five simple ultrasound-based rule predict malignancy ( M-rules ) five rule predict benign tumor ( B-rules ) . If none M- B-rules meet ( 20 % patient ) test inconclusive . Recent report show simple rule might superior RMI . In adnexal mass simple ultrasound rule yield inconclusive result , subjective assessment Gray-scale color Doppler ultrasound image experience ultrasound examiner use second stage test achieve optimal diagnostic performance . Subjective assessment expert sonographer superior score system mathematical model classify adnexal mass benign malignant . However , feasible efficient every patient would undergo expert ultrasonography . Therefore , method well use second stage test . Another option use Diffusion Weighted - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DW-MRI ) second stage test , simple rule yield inconclusive result . The use MRI - interpret specialize radiologists- also seem superior RMI preoperative identification adnexal mass . The Risk Malignancy Index ( RMI ) current standard differentiate benign malignant adnexal mass . The simple ultrasound-based rule first stage triage test follow either subjective assessment experience ultrasound examiner DW-MRI case simple rule inconclusive , test comparison . Both RMI simple rule perform regional hospital MUMC+ general gynaecologist ultrasound scan . Only simple rule inconclusive patient refer MUMC+ second stage test . From previous publication deduct approximately 20 % patient . Approximately 80 % patient need additional second stage test . The histology surgically remove adnexal mass clinical reference standard .</detailed_description>
