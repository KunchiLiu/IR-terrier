	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) potential cure variety malignant non-malignant disease . However , associate significant morbidity , treatment-related mortality . This due large part prolong pancytopenia immunosuppression associate preparatory regimen chemotherapy and/or radiation wait engraftment transplant hematopoietic stem cell . During vulnerable period , infectious complication common . Historically HCT patient keep protected environment safeguard health pancytopenic phase ; despite measure , infectious complication graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain common lead significant morbidity mortality HCT . Currently patient still closely watched inpatient day hospital environment , though recent practice allow patient freedom . This study randomize eligible patient receive post-transplant care home vs. hospital clinic , per standard care . The primary objective compare incidence grade II-IV acute GVHD 6 month patient receive patient-centered medical home ( PCMH ) v standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medical Home Care Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient-centered medical home ( PCMH ) excite strategy potential revolutionize hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) . Traditionally , home care use palliative care end-stage cancer patient geriatrics . More recently PCMH gain increase adoption primary care care medically complex patient . The core PCMH lie interaction healthcare team , patient 's family support , , patient . These interaction enhance health information technologies electronic health record ( EHR ) videoconferencing via iPads . In addition , collection patient report outcome ( PRO ) allow feedback adjustment . This integration especially important consider multiple complicate need HCT patient : navigating Byzantine healthcare system often require input coordination multiple specialist include transplanter , hematologist , infectious disease physician , gastroenterologist , psychiatrist , nutritionist , pharmacist , social worker , financial coordinator , etc . ; manage medication regimen prevent infection , GVHD , complication ( mention avoid drug food interaction ) ; adjust multiple side effect include fatigue , weakness , anorexia , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , rash , pain , anxiety , stress , organ failure , etc . ; sheer amount time require healthcare visit , lab draw , wait result , infusion , transfusion , etc . ; physical psychosocial struggle live life-threatening disease ; burden treatment often seem debilitate disease . The PCMH provide patient-centered , comprehensive , accessible , coordinate care systems-based approach quality safety : attribute essential successful care complicate HCT patient . approach potential low overall cost preserve increase quality care .</detailed_description>
