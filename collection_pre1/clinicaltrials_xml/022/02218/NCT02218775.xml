	<brief_summary>The available treatment patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder significant limitation . This study contribute significantly public health take step address limitation aid interpretation study : 1 ) test promise new treatment mood anxiety spectrum disorder ; 2 ) evaluate potential target brain could serve basis development additional new candidate compound treatment patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder ; 3 ) establishes expeditious method evaluate potential new therapy patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder ; 4 ) specifically establish method development new therapy target anhedonia , important RDoC ( Research Domain Criteria ) endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FASTMAS ( Fast-Fail Trials Mood Anxiety Spectrum Disorders ) Kappa Opioid Receptor Phase 1 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label study two week daily dose LY2456302 carry 10 healthy volunteer . Subjects initial screen visit opportunity sign inform consent . Those choose undergo series screening test determine whether meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study . Those qualify return 1-7 day baseline set assessment include : MRI image carry first day ( structural MRI , fMRI Monetary Incentive Delay Task , Resting State Connectivity fMRI ) , second day arterial line place ; undergo [ 11C ] -Carfentanil ( synthetic , highly specific mu opioid receptor ( mu-OR ) agonist ) PET mu opioid receptor occupancy study ; undergo LY2879788 ( radioactive biochemical substance ( particular , ligand ) use diagnosis research-oriented study receptor system body ) PET Kappa Occupancy Study single blood sample take prior scan , sample scan , sample take 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 120 minute scan determine whole blood radioactivity , plasma radioactivity , un-metabolized tracer fraction time need determine input function kinetic model analysis parameter estimation need compute receptor occupancy PET scan data ; complete SHAPS ; undergo PRT . Note arterial line placement serial blood sample need LY2879788 scan , unlike [ 11C ] -Carfentanil , accept reference region brain human ligand necessitates development kinetic model scan parameter estimation . The next day subject begin take LY2456302 10 mg daily 11 return research unit 6 day later safety assessment visit . Subjects return research unit 7 day later undergo interval history safety assessment , take medication 11 , MRI image 1:30 pm . A blood sample determine LY2456302 level obtain immediately MRI image session determine relationship ventral striatal activation task serum level LY2456302 . They return research unit following day take last dose study medication 11 1:30 pm undergo [ 11C ] -Carfentanil PET mu opioid receptor occupancy study . A blood sample determine LY2456302 level obtain immediately PET image session determine relationship receptor occupancy serum level study drug . The following day subject arterial line place undergo LY2879788 PET Kappa Occupancy Study 9:30 single blood sample take prior scan sample take 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 120 minute scan determine whole blood radioactivity , plasma radioactivity , un-metabolized tracer fraction time need determine input function kinetic model analysis parameter estimation need compute receptor occupancy PET scan data . A blood sample determine LY2456302 level also obtain immediately PET image session compute relationship serum level receptor occupancy . Subjects return 6 day later safety assessment participation study end .</detailed_description>
