	<detailed_description>Peripheral neuropathy cause progressive injury long nerve body , start toe , progress slowly leg . Neuropathy often cause pain , numbness , weakness foot lead reduce mobility , foot ulcer , even amputation . The common cause diabetes , work University Utah find prediabetes consequence obesity , include abnormal cholesterol level , may associate neuropathy . Research show risk factor may damage nerve interfere ability nerve grow back injury . This study aim 1. characterize peripheral nerve function cutaneous nerve structure obese bariatric surgery candidate ; 2. evaluate peripheral nerve regeneration capacity ( nerve function measure ) bariatric surgery obese subject mild neuropathy ; 3. examine relationship ectopic lipid accumulation , lipotoxic mediator , neuropathy regeneration capacity surgical candidate one year surgery .</detailed_description>
