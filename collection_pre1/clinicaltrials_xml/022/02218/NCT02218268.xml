	<brief_summary>Using radial artery tonometry study arterial stiffness , plan study cohort 65 child Type I diabetes mellitus . This prospective , crossover study help determine acute increase arterial stiffness child Type I diabetes mellitus give extra insulin cover meal . This give support show critical bolus every time eat bolus time decrease cardiovascular consequence poorly control diabetes . The hypothesis give insulin meal compare give insulin meal associate lower arterial stiffness child type I diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject fast overnight ( nothing eat drink least 8 hour ) . The subject ask drink mixed meal replacement drink ( Boost ) randomize ( like flip coin ) bolus insulin `` meal '' bolus insulin use standard insulin dose . Glucose monitor finger prick drink meal replacement , 1 hour later finally 2 hour drink meal replacement . Stiffness blood vessel wrist determine use radial tonometry . Radial tonometry safe hurt . A pen like probe place blood vessel wrist . When machine read good wave form computer calculate stiffness blood vessel . This test do along glucose check ; drink meal replacement drink , 1 2 hour drink meal replacement drink . During next study visit , subject repeat exact study describe . However , time receive insulin assignment assign first study ( either bolus bolus ) .</detailed_description>
