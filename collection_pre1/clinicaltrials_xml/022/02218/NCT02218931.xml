The investigator work funded National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) UK show dietary intervention obese pregnant woman may reduce risk preeclampsia . The investigator propose show pregnant woman metabolic risk factor derive benefit simple , target intervention base Mediterranean dietary pattern reduce risk maternal fetal complication . Women risk factor ( 1230 woman ) randomly allocate dietary intervention usual antenatal dietary advice risk maternal fetal complication evaluate . The remain eligible woman consent lipid test , metabolic risk factor , follow outcome data . Diet base intervention , especially base Mediterranean dietary pattern potential reduce risk preeclampsia . In investigator study , pregnant mother risk factor randomly allocate either dietary invention usual antenatal care ass composite maternal ( pre-eclampsia gestational diabetes ) fetal ( stillbirth , small gestational age admission neonatal intensive care unit ) outcomes .

	<detailed_description>Obesity grow problem east London fifth woman enter pregnancy obese . In addition obesity , metabolic risk factor raise lipid , high blood pressure insulin resistance increasingly prevalent . With large proportion ethnic minority mother east London , dietary habit underlie genetic predisposition major contributor phenomenon . Obesity raise serum lipid , especially triglycerides increase risk complication preeclampsia pregnancy cardiovascular event myocardial infarction , stroke death long term . Preeclampsia , condition pregnancy , raise blood pressure increase protein urine lead cause maternal fetal death . Its treatment give rise large health care cost . Preeclampsia contribute preterm birth , one lead cause perinatal death east London . It account 65 % neonatal death 50 % neurological disability childhood . Around £900 million extra cost care preterm baby per year NHS link neonatal care . Preeclampsia , characterise insulin resistance , widespread endothelial damage dysfunction , coagulation defect increase systemic inflammatory response , share metabolic risk factor cardiovascular disease . Obesity , dyslipidaemia hypertension independent risk factor pre-eclampsia . Interventions reduce cardiovascular event modify metabolic risk factor also potential reduce risk pre-eclampsia . Early identification mother risk preeclampsia allow clinician deliver target intervention pregnancy , potential prevent preeclampsia modify cardiovascular risk long-term . Currently , low dose aspirin , recommend prophylactic measure reduce preeclampsia risk 10 % . Simple , low-cost effective acceptable intervention require reduce risk . Dietary intervention pregnant woman metabolic risk factor obesity insulin resistance show reduce risk preeclampsia . But exist study poor quality evaluate preeclampsia primary outcome . Furthermore , focus specific component diet , rather modify overall dietary pattern . Mediterranean diet high consumption vegetable fruit , olive oil nut low consumption red meat process food significantly reduce lipid level cardiovascular adverse event non-pregnant high risk population . In pregnancy , beneficial effect Mediterranean dietary pattern observe large prospective study nulliparous pregnant woman 28 % reduction risk preeclampsia ( RR 0.72; 95 % CI 0.62 , 0.85 ) . These result need confirmation sound experimental study . There need adequately power randomised trial evaluate beneficial effect lipid modify diet pregnancy simple , accessible acceptable . The investigator hypothesis pregnant woman metabolic risk factor derive benefit dietary intervention prevent maternal fetal complication .</detailed_description>
