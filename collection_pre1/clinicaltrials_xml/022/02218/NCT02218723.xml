	<brief_summary>This open-label , five- period , cross-over , randomize , single dose , single centre study healthy subject . This second clinical study UD-DPI . This study ascertain whether Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) systemic exposure [ term area plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) maximum observe plasma concentration ( Cmax ) ] FF deliver via UD-DPI comparable systemic exposure FF deliver via ELLIPTA Dry Powder Inhaler ( DPI ) . For reason four treatment dos consist three dose strength 2 percentage blend assess delivered via UD-DPI . This study design compare pharmacokinetic profile various dose blend FF administer via UD-DPI relative FF administer via ELLIPTA DPI . Subjects screen 28 day prior study initiation . During treatment period , subject study site even prior dose completion 48 hour post-dose PK sample collection Day 3 . Minimum 7 day washout treatment completion five treatment follow-up visit conduct 7-14 day post last dose . Duration study 13 week . ELLIPTA register trademark GSK group company .</brief_summary>
