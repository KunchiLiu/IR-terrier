	<brief_summary>Purpose aim The general aim project improve diagnostic method disease activity identify predictive factor ( clinical radiographic factor , pro- anti-inflammatory mediator saliva plasma ) temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) involvement juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) . The hypothesis self-reported pain impaired jaw function together clinical finding correlate well radiological sign jaw involvement . Null hypothesis : Self-reported pain , impaired jaw function clinical finding correlate radiological sign jaw involvement . Study 1 The aim study investigate finding patient history clinical examination significance diagnostics TMJ involvement patient JIA short- long-term perspective . The patient followed-up two year . They undergo clinical examination accord Research Diagnostic Criteria Temporomandibular Disorders ( RDC/TMD ; Dworkin LeResche 1992 ) year telephone follow-up sixth month clinical examination . Further , clinical finding orofacial region compare general disease activity . Study 2 The aim second study correlate radiological finding clinical finding order investigate early radiological sign disease activity progression also compare radiographic examination use conventional panoramic technique computer tomography ( CT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One-hundred consecutive patient active JIA , diagnose Department Pediatric Rheumatology , Astrid Lindgrens Barnsjukhus , Karolinska University Hospital include . Inclusion criterion : - age 7 14 year - diagnosis JIA accord International League Associations rheumatology Exclusion criterion : - current malignancy - TMJ surgery trauma within two year - recent intra-articular glucocorticoid injection TMJ ( within 1 month ) - condition disease JIA may cause orofacial pain . The parent patient and/or patient give verbal write informed consent participate study accord permission regional ethical committee 2011/2:1 . Clinical examination follow-up The patient examine clinically three time interval 12 month . The clinical examination perform accord RDC-TMD calibrated investigator . Panoramic x-ray CT scan perform inclusion examination well end study 24 month . Pharmacological treatment record every clinical examination telephone interview . The patient also examine pediatric rheumatologist regard general disease activity accord Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 27 ( JADAS-27 ) , Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey ( SF-36 ) , thrombocyte particle count , C-reactive protein blood titer rheumatoid factor anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide . Information examination pediatric rheumatologist drawn Swedish national register child JIA . Telephone interview Six month first second visit , structure telephone interview patient and/or parent perform accord questionnaire . The objective estimate degree joint pain functional limitation jaw function . Radiological examination Conventional panoramic x-rays bilateral TMJ image obtain digital volume tomography ( DVT , New Tom Model QR-DVT 9000 , New Tom AG , Marburg , Germany ) . The CT section evaluate specialist oral radiology presence radiographic sign cortical subcortical erosion , flattening , sclerosis ramus height .</detailed_description>
