	<brief_summary>The study involve place dental implant guide surgery protocol develop use 3D CT technology . Because implant position plan digitally use CT data patient , allow investigation abutment support implant crown soft tissue fabricate prior implant placement . In , make protocol patient care simpler faster . In fabricate abutment prior surgery , investigator design abutment different height gumline see optimal margin height fabrication abutment prior surgery . The study hypothesis often abutment margin place slightly ( .5mm ) gumline visible half time abutment margin place gumline ( 1.5mm ) visible 10 % time . The optimal outcome delivery follow-up , abutment margin show intraorally .</brief_summary>
