	<detailed_description>Title : Prospective , Double-blind , Randomized Study Evaluate Single Shot Adductor Canal Nerve Block versus Femoral Nerve Block combine LIA ( Local Infiltration Analgesia ) : Early Postoperative Period Functional Outcomes Total Knee Arthroplasty . Objectives : Primary : To determine patient undergo Total Knee Arthroplasty receive Adductor Canal block result increase quadriceps muscle strength ( MVIC ) compare receive Femoral Nerve block 24 hour . Secondary : The secondary objective determine whether Adductor Canal nerve block result improve functional outcome evidence Time GO , Range Motion Six-Minute Walk Test 24 hour , 48 hour 6 month . To assess post-operative pain measure Visual Analog pain score ( VAS ) immediately prior start , , in-patient physical therapy session . Study Design : Prospective , double-blind , randomize study Description Intervention : The device use study intend nerve block consist 13-6 MHz linear ultrasound transducer ( SonoSite HFL38x ; Washington , US ) , 22-gauge , 50-mm , short-bevel stimulating needle ( Stimuplex ; B Braun , Bethlehem , Pennsylvania ) , B/Braun Stimuplex DIG RC , Bupivacaine HCl 100 mg inject Adductor Canal around Femoral nerve . Femoral nerve block combination local infiltration analgesia standard care investigator institution present . Bupivacaine HCl 100 mg combination Toradol 30 mg use local infiltration anterior lateral lateral posterior side knee , do surgeon use standard technique . Subject Population : The study include male female adult meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . For patient time conduct block vary 5-10 minute , local infiltration analgesia 5-10 minute , physical therapy test 30 minute one hour encounter , VAS pain assessment 2-5 minute Subject Participation Duration : The rate patient accrual , prescribed follow-up time , total duration study expect approximately 18 month enrollment expect occur 12 month follow-up period 6 month physical therapy office visit . Number Patients : The study include 120 patient . Number Sites : The study include one site . Study Duration : The expect study duration approximately 18 month . Endpoints : Endpoints study include quadriceps muscle strength , ROM knee , TUG , 6 minute walk test , knee pain score ( VAS ) , activity daily live , adverse event study baseline 6 month TKR . VAS pain score assess physical therapy encounter .</detailed_description>
