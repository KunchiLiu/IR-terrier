	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate level cytokine ( small protein important cell signal ) eye fluid ( aqueous humour ) patient wet age relate macular degeneration patient treat injection eye ( intravitreal injection ) drug call ranibizumab . The level cytokine compare patient good response ranibizumab treatment patient non-responsive ranibizumab need form therapy . This knowledge help future treatment potentially develop new medication wet age-related macular degeneration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Cytokines Non-responders Ranibizumab Treatment Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In treatment CNV ( Choroidal NeoVascularization ) secondary AMD ( Age Related Macular Degeneration ) use ranibizumab , patient non-responders find approximately 1-10 % treatment . Thus , failure treatment lead loss vision . Growth factor cytokine , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , pigment epithelium derive factor ( PEDF ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) placenta growth factor ( PLGF ) know play important role development CNV angiogenesis . The rationale conduct study compare VEGF , PEDF , IL-6 PLGF cytokine level aqueous humor wet AMD Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy ( PCV ) patient poor responder anti VEGF treatment age-matched `` good '' responder anti VEGF . Ranibizumab poor responder AMD PCV , treat combination PDT/ranibizumab intravitreous injection aflibercept ( EyeleaÂ® , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Tarrytown , NY , USA Bayer , Basel , Switzerland ) enrol study . An aqueous humor sample obtain patient receives intravitreal injection treatment also 1 , 2 month follow period . VEGF , PEDF , IL-6 PLGF aqueous analyze use compare poor response group age match patient good response ranibizumab . Age , gender , visual acuity , central macular thickness OCT , lesion size fundus autofluorescence data collect use compare group . Subgroup analysis different treatment comparison ranibizumab good responder group evaluate . Factors associate non-responders ranibizumab analyze . Non-responders ranibizumab treatment AMD may different level response inflammatory cytokine compare responder group . Understanding pathogenesis characteristic specific group patient help narrow specific choice treatment prevent reduction visual acuity patient . This study also help identify factor associate poor responder ranibizumab treatment wAMD .</detailed_description>
