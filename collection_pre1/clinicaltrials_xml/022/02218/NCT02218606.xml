	<criteria>Patient need histologic cytologic diagnosis prostate cancer Documented progressive metastatic CRPC base least one follow criterion : 1 . PSA progression define 25 % increase baseline value increase absolute value least 2 ng/mL confirm another PSA level minimum 1 week interval minimum PSA 2 ng/mL . 2 . Softtissue progression define increase ≥ 20 % sum LD target lesion base small sum LD since treatment start appearance one new lesion . 3 . Progression bone disease ( evaluable disease ) ( new bone lesion ( ) ) bone scan . Agree undergo biopsy least one metastatic site primary prostate determination RB status . Adequate archival metastatic tissue use available lieu biopsy do patient CRPC ( within 6 month treatment start ) . ECOG performance status 02 . Age ≥ 18 year . Have testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL . Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation LHRH/GnRH analogue ( agonist antagonist ) undergone orchiectomy . Patients long term ( &gt; 6 month ) antiandrogen therapy ( e.g . flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ) need antiandrogen 4 week ( wash period ) show evidence disease progression antiandrogen . Patients antiandrogen 6 month less need discontinue antiandrogen therapy prior treatment start ( wash period require ) . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define obtain within 14 day prior treatment start : ANC &gt; =1,500/μl Hemoglobin &gt; =9g/dL Platelet count &gt; =100,000/μl Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Potassium &gt; 3.5 mmol/L ( within institutional normal range ) Bilirubin ≤ ULN ( unless document Gilbert 's disease ) SGOT ( AST ) &lt; =2.5 x ULN SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; =2.5 x ULN The effect cabazitaxel abiraterone acetate develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation least 3 month thereafter . Patients must able take oral medication without crush , dissolve chew tablet . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy major surgery . However , least 21 day prior treatment start must elapse since completion radiation therapy major surgery patient must recover side effect time randomization . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document approve local institutional review board . Patients may receive investigational agent . Any prior investigational therapeutic product must stop least 28 day ( 4 week washout ) prior treatment start . No prior exposure abiraterone acetate specific CYP17 inhibitor . No prior chemotherapy regimen . Prior isotope therapy Strontium89 , Samarium RAD223 complete least three month ( 12 week ) prior treatment start . No ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Patients antifungal agent ( itraconazole , fluconazole ) within 4 week prior treatment start recover AEs due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients history pituitary adrenal dysfunction , active symptomatic viral hepatitis chronic liver disease eligible . Patients know symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic AEs . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cabazitaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 ; abiraterone acetate . Patients may continue daily MultiVitamin , calcium Vitamin D , herbal , alternative food supplement ( i.e . PCSpes , Saw Palmetto , St John Wort , etc . ) must discontinue treatment start . Patients must plan receive concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy , surgery prostate cancer , radiation therapy protocol treatment . Patients stable dos bisphosphonates RANKL inhibitor , Denosumab , start less 4 week prior treatment start , may continue medication , however patient allow initiate bisphosphonate/Denosumab therapy study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation , opinion investigator , would limit</criteria>
