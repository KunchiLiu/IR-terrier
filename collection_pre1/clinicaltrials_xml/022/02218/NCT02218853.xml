	<detailed_description>The B-SNIP research consortium previously obtain dense phenotype across psychosis spectrum effort observe feature ( ) distinctive ( ii ) share DSM-type categorical diagnosis . Despite broad range extra-clinical phenotype , limited success find clinical SZ-BD diagnosis-specific feature ; instead , phenotype distribute continuously across DSM diagnosis . To describe biologically homogeneous group , therefore , combine psychosis probands implement multi-stage analysis procedure , begin identification psychosis biomarkers ( variable large effect size differentiate psychosis healthy group ) include cognitive , electrophysiological , oculo-motor measure ( 'classical ' endophenotypes ) . We estimate number subgroup efficiently optimize variance among biomarkers ( n=3 ) differentiate individual psychosis case subgroup . Subsequently , subgroup test biological uniqueness use meaningful external validators ( structural functional brain imaging , social functioning , familial data ) . Given neurobiological distinctiveness subgroup , call psychosis Biotypes . DSM diagnose distribute across Biotypes . Compared DSM diagnose , Biotype membership enhance group separation biomarkers . These result indicate group psychosis case generate homogeneous phenotypic characteristic independent DSM diagnosis . The propose study aim develop Biotype definition demonstrate psychosis Biotypes construct dense biomarker panel ( ) replicable , ( ii ) neurobiologically distinctive , ( iii ) unique genetic characteristic .</detailed_description>
