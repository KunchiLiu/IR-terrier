	<brief_summary>Galactosaemia inherit condition cause lack enzyme ( catalyst ) normally break galactose ( sugar find milk product ) . This affect 1:19,000 birth annually Ireland ( high incidence worldwide ) screen National Newborn Screening Programme . When affected infant diagnose , galactose immediately restrict diet . This prevents often fatal liver disease immediate complication . However , despite early treatment majority affect patient go develop long-term complication intellectual impairment , neurological complication , speech difficulty infertility female . The underlying mechanisms complication unclear . The investigator show detailed biochemical gene analysis study major abnormality affect function complex molecule body , particularly glycoprotein , ( consist sugar chain attached protein ) persist treated individual may lead disturbance body 's intrinsic cellular machinery relate complication see . In research investigator expand early study see identify biomarkers part galactose/glycosylation pathway could modify change new treatment improve outcome condition ( i.e. , IgG N glycans ) . In detail , investigator test use abundant glycoprotein human plasma ( IgG ) improve clinical test monitoring galactose control need patient also see patient ( include child age 5-12 yr ) might well predict outcome moderate increase galactose diet . The investigator believe study greatly improve understand Galactosaemia view improve current treatment option future outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Classical Galactosaemia inherit disorder galactose metabolism cause profound deficiency galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT : EC 2.7.712 ) . This result systemic accumulation toxic galactose intermediate decrease level UDP-galactose , require sugar glycosylation . Galactosaemia relatively high incidence Ireland , ( 1:19,000 birth ) present particular public health problem . The neonatal life-threatening phenotype ( liver disease , coagulopathy sepsis ) rescue restriction dietary galactose . However , outcome treatment disappoint beyond neonatal period ( even successful newborn screening , early treatment long term compliance ) . The majority Irish patient harbour severe Q188R Galt mutation . 56.5 % Irish patient ≥ 6yrs IQs ≤ 79 ; 91.2 % Irish female patient ≥ 13yrs Premature Ovarian Insufficiency ( POI ) . Unfortunately , basic pathophysiology condition remain enigmatic limited treatment approach . In early work , investigator report considerable variation patient outcome , even among sibling . The investigator propose difference determine variation galactose accessory pathway ( beyond GALT deficiency ) . This may result variable galactose tolerance patient link variation glycosylation pathway could allow enhance UDP-galactose bioavailability essential glycosylation . In previous current work investigator identify ongoing dysregulation glycoprotein formation expression gene involve glycan biosynthesis cell signal pathway treat Galactosaemia patient . The present proposal , build publish previous work , enable investigator establish Galactosaemia modifiable , multi-systemic glycosylation defect . The overall objective work progress development biochemical marker ( IgG N-glycan analysis ) prognostic index potentially modifiable relevant pathway . The investigator consider phenotype could relax patient Classical Galactosaemia , initially study modification exogenous galactose requirement identify ongoing glycan processing defect identify may improve reflect accessory pathway galactose disposal . Study Aim : Expand previous publish work use IgG N-glycan analysis examine glycosylation status treat adult Galactosaemia patient large study develop test reliable diagnostic tool . The investigator also carry pilot study examine effect diet relaxation paediatric patient ( 5-12 yr ) aim determine optimum galactose intake level cohort hope prevent long-term complication later life . The investigator propose research offer new insight ongoing pathophysiology rare disorder possibility develop new treatment target , time could cost-effective prevent major disability .</detailed_description>
