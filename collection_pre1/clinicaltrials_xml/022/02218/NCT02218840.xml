	<brief_summary>Lovelace Scientific Resources conduct clinical research study cigar smoker . This study evaluate behavior cigar smoker short term effect cigar smoke . A cigar define cylinder tobacco wrap tobacco leaf smoking . There small cigar filter resemble cigarette large cigar filter . Because cigar come many shape size , nicotine content varies well . The way cigar smoker consumes cigar also effect much nicotine absorb . This study seek understand nicotine consumption addiction cigar smoker . Study participation last 1 4 week include 2 study-related visit . Your visit may include physical exam , medical history review , questionnaire , blood collection , provide urine sample , exhale breath test , vital sign collect smoke cigar . You videotape smoke cigar review technique use smoking . STUDY HYPOTHESES : - Significant reduction crave withdrawal report ad libitum smoke cigar compare self-report prior cigar smoking . - Cigar smoker show range nicotine dependence , subset user exceed minimal criterion nicotine dependence . - Levels nicotine , cotinine , Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) , 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanol ( NNAL ) increase significantly pre- post-cigar smoking . - Small cigar/cigarillo user demonstrate great level dependence great relief crave withdrawal compare large cigar user .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek good understand dependence behavior small large cigar smoker . All recruit cigar smoker self-defined user ≥ 1 day ( ) per week past 6 month . They currently use type tobacco product past 6 month . Study subject smoke type brand cigar upon least 24 hour abstinence tobacco product . Dependence ( real perceive ) , withdrawal relief , crave measure exist modified behavioral scale assessment . In addition , smoke topography ( include latency first puff , puff number , interpuff interval , smoke duration ) , self-reported inhalation behavior , exhale CO also measure . This single center , un-blinded study seek good understand dependence behavior small large cigar smoker . Subjects videotape smoke cigar use digital camcorder , video immediately burn DVD subsequent smoking topography score two separate raters . These raters directly observe subject cigar smoking exposure . Urine sample serial blood sample collect measure biomarkers exposure ( include nicotine , cotinine , total NNAL ) , , subject ' smoke usual type brand cigar . A urine creatinine lab test collect pre post exposure correct excrete cotinine level . Subjects instruct empty bladder pre cigar exposure . They instruct rehydrate base BMI prior initiation cigar smoke exposure 60 minute post cigar initiation . Hepatic renal function assess screen determine metabolism problem . Subjects ask bring two ( 2 ) cigar usual type brand . One cigar use smoke ; 2nd cigar use measure total nicotine content . The cigar store ambient temperature ( 59º - 86º F ) , away light moisture , analysis . Nicotine concentration determine 2nd cigar use analytical approach develop Lovelace Biomedical Environmental Research Institute ( LBERI ) . Briefly , cigar weight record , cigar broken apart , mixed use mortar pestle create homogenous mixture entire cigar . 100 mg cigar mixture weight nicotine extract tobacco use 1mL 50/50 dichloromethane : dichloroethane repeat twice . The extract evaporate re-dissolved 1 mL methanol liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) analysis . Plasma concentration nicotine cotinine determine use LC-MS/MS value export Phoenix WinNonlin pharmacokinetic analysis . Plasma Tmax Cmax report use table word document figure generate use WinNonlin . The amount cotinine total NNAL excrete report determine urinary concentration compound LC-MS/MS analysis multiplying determine concentration total volume urine recover . Individual data along group result report . The pharmacokinetic data provide sponsor uploading SAS . The subject cigar smoker seek treatment smoke cessation currently use type tobacco , may former user . They must agree abstain smoke least 24 hour prior exposure day inform must remain abstinent form tobacco include nicotine patch , gum , etc . Abstinence verify begin test day expire CO self-report . While could desirable use urinary cotinine level marker abstinence , urinary cotinine level appear reach undetectable level smoker 24 hour . Instead , regular smoker , negligent level reach abstinence 7-8 day , would place significant burden subject study . All subject healthy male female , 18 year age old , self-reported psychiatric illness would interfere subject ability complete session ( i.e . schizophrenia , severe depression ) . Women pregnant ( verified urine pregnancy test Visit 1 2 ) breastfeeding exclude . Subjects ask question concern type quantity prescribe non-prescribed drug currently use . If , result screening , subject determine ineligible continue participation study , he/she excuse participation . A target sixty four ( 64 ) complete subject recruited ensure sufficient statistical power test main effect across follow group : 1 . Primary vs. secondary cigar user 2 . Self-reported inhale behavior vs. self-reported non-inhaling behavior 3 . Small cigar ( include cigarillo ) vs. large cigar ( include premium ) users 4 . White vs. non-white adult 5 . Male v . Female adults A power analysis conduct determine overall sample size need test main effect . According power analysis ( see ) , study require 64 subject assume balance design across factor ( i.e . subject stratify across 5 factor total 32 group ) . However , give potential difficulty fill group design , may recruit 50 % subject ( i.e . 96 ) , ensure group sufficiently represent final sample . Finally , assume 10 % dropout rate , additional 10 subject may enrol total sample size 106 . Subjects monitor adverse event ( AEs ) throughout study .</detailed_description>
