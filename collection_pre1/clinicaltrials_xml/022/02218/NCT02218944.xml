	<brief_summary>The current study test response inhibition retrain program , implement mobile device , mechanism increase relapse prevention smoke cessation attempt . Study participant ( n = 150 ) randomly assign control , benign , intervention condition . They complete 2 week response inhibition retraining , engage cessation attempt . It hypothesize individual receive intervention decrease likelihood relapse follow cessation attempt . In addition , hypothesize due decrease implicit smoke motivation function response inhibition training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smoking lead preventable cause death disease U.S. Each year approximately 30 % smoker try quit , vast majority attempt ( ~90 % ) end relapse . This complicate treatment barrier related cost accessibility . Identifying cost effective way aide cessation success , widely disseminate , remain vitally important . According dual-process model substance use , addiction develop via imbalance effortful control automatic psychological process . The affective processing model suggest withdrawal , automatic psychological process increase implicit drug seek motivation . Implicit motivation hypothesize underlying mechanism automatic psychological process exert control behavior . Research suggest behavioral impulse control may attenuate association implicit motivation substance use . Response inhibition , one form behavioral impulse control , ability inhibit behavioral response salient approach cue . Smokers tend less behavioral impulse control . In addition , poor behavioral impulse control make individual vulnerable various risk factor associate relapse ( e.g. , positive expectancy , high crave abstinence , etc. ) . Improving smoke relevant behavioral impulse control may affect multiple index relapse . Research cognitive retrain show response inhibition modify training . Recently extend training use mobile device . The development mobile intervention specifically target underlie mechanism addiction may provide novel adjunct current cessation program . The current proposal build previous research implement response inhibition training paradigm context cessation trial . It hypothesize task reduce likelihood relapse follow quit attempt . Furthermore , hypothesize training effect operate via decrease implicit motivation global craving . If successful , current study provide evidence relapse prevention tool ( 1 ) increase overall cessation success ( 2 ) widely easily disperse .</detailed_description>
