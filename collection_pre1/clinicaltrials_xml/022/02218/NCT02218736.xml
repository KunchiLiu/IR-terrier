	<brief_summary>The available treatment patient mood anxiety disorder significant limitation ( Rush , 2007 ; Denys de Geus , 2005 ) . There need develop new treatment people disorder . Many research study carry animal preliminary study carry human suggest medication block kappa opioid receptor ( KOR ) potential effective new treatment patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder . These medication show particular promise improve one important type difficulty experience many patient suffer mood anxiety spectrum disorder refer anhedonia , impairment reward-related function . In study test hypothesis KOR antagonism promise mean improve anhedonia patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder . We evaluate whether establish Proof Concept ( POC ) relatively selective KOR antagonist , CERC-501 ( formerly know LY2456302 ) , engage neural circuit involve mediate reward-related function patient mood anxiety spectrum disorder anhedonia . We attempt establish POC study order determine whether sufficient basis pursue future work evaluate whether KOR antagonism therapeutic effect clinical behavioral measure reward-related functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FAST-MAS address important problem critical barrier progress Mood Anxiety Spectrum Disorders aim project achieve , FAST-MAS could shift scientific knowledge , technical capacity , clinical practice positive direction . The Mood Anxiety Spectrum disorder extremely common associate significant morbidity mortality , , represent important public health problem United States . The mood disorder include follow diagnostic entity : major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , bipolar disorder ( include subtypes mania , mixed state , depress , well type I II ) , dysthymic disorder . Available epidemiologic data suggest prevalence mood disorder extremely high among adult United States , approach 10 % . Among mood disorder , MDD high lifetime prevalence , recent estimate 16 % . According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , MDD currently lead cause disability great burden illness develop country third common cause disability worldwide . MDD life shorten due suicide association increase mortality medical condition . It also highly recurrent condition 50 % 75 % person diagnose MDD experience one episode . Bipolar Disorder also highly recurrent condition . The lifetime prevalence bipolar disorder estimate approximately 3.4 % World Health Survey Initiative . Approximately 60 % affected individual experience severe severe role impairment base Sheehan Disability Scale , like MDD , bipolar disorder associate significant suicide risk . The anxiety disorder also common associate significant adverse impact affected individual society . These disorder include follow diagnostic entity : generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , panic disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , social phobia , specific phobia , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . As group , condition affect approximately 18 % adult give year associate significant co-morbidities adverse consequence . Of anxiety disorder , GAD appear associate great per patient cost disability degree disability comparable MDD comparable chronic medical condition arthritis , diabetes , peptic ulcer disease . It affect approximately 6.8 million adult U.S. highly chronic condition . Panic disorder affect 6 million American adult twice common woman men . Panic disorder also highly disable often chronic even mild form disorder link significantly increase impairment function quality life well number comorbidities . Approximately 2.2 million adult U.S. affect obsessive-compulsive disorder disorder often accompany psychiatric comorbidities . Roughly half individual condition chronic unremitting course associate significant disability morbidity . Social phobia , also know social anxiety disorder , see roughly 15 million adult U.S. often associate MDD anxiety disorder . It generally chronic condition lead great degree disability due substantial impairment social , educational , occupational function . Approximately 8 million adult U.S. experience PTSD approximately 12 % population PTSD point life affect individual frequently experience associate MDD , anxiety disorder substance use problem . The level disability associate condition tend quite high include impairment social occupational function quality life . There also substantial financial social cost associate PTSD due increase hospitalization rate , suicidality , substance use problem . Mood disorder anxiety disorder highly prevalent condition , many chronic , nearly associate substantial comorbidities , disability impairment associate increase risk mortality . Despite availability many pharmacologic , psychotherapeutic , brain stimulation , combination treatment option available clinician , many patient Mood Anxiety Spectrum Disorders respond poorly treatment . In light impairment , cost , risk disorder , limitation available treatment represent enormous burden public health speak strongly need new treatment condition well novel methodology treatment development faster exist methodology also promote new way think disorder treatment capitalize recent ongoing development basic science . This study six-site randomize , double-blind , PBO ( placebo ) -controlled , parallel-group mono-therapy study assess effect CERC-501 ( formerly know LY2456302 ) compare PBO adult age 21-65 year mood anxiety spectrum disorder . We recruit total 90 subject , 45 randomize CERC-501 45 placebo 8 week treatment</detailed_description>
