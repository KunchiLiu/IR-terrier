	<brief_summary>Coronary CT angiography use examine coronary artery non-invasive way patient suspect coronary artery disease . The test , however , require relatively high level radiation , link DNA damage cancer , use contrast material , affect kidney function . The SOMATOM Force , new third-generation CT scanner manufacture Siemens , recently instal MUSC hold potential obtain quality image also reduce radiation dose contrast material . This study aim test diagnostic ability SOMATOM Force detect coronary artery disease also see radiation dose contrast material reduce compare previous 2nd generation scanner . It suspect Force provide clinical quality image decrease radiation dose contrast material require .</brief_summary>
