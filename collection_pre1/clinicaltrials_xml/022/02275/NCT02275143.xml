	<brief_summary>Currently patient certain cancer usually routine follow ( Computed Tomography Thorax , Abdomen Pelvis ) CT TAP scan see response treatment relapse . The study proposal allow evaluation coronary artery modify current CT TAP technique without significant additional procedure , intravenous contrast radiation - i.e . opportunistic Computed Tomography Coronary Angiogram ( CTCA ) without penalty . The question perform Computed Tomography ( CT ) thorax way confer important additional information cardiac risk ? At time investigator need ensure scan per CTCA protocol produce equivalent image quality evaluate structure chest . A recent small retrospective study use similar technique suggest may fact improve image quality due less cardiac related motion artefact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography ( CT ) Coronary Angiogram Evaluation Cancer Patients Having CT Thorax , Abdomen Pelvis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study non-inferiority observational study primarily ensure Computed Tomography Thorax , Abdomen Pelvis ( CT TAP ) technique produce equivalent image quality lung ( hence need scan conventional technique Electrocardiograph [ ECG ] gate technique ) secondarily evaluate effectiveness demonstrate coronary artery cohort patient receive heart rate control .</detailed_description>
