	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-period , complete block design cross-over study . The purpose study evaluate effect UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram ( mcg ) EET measure Endurance Shuttle Walk Test ( ESWT ) compare placebo . Additionally , effect UMEC/VI compare placebo lung function lung volume COPD patient characterize . Approximately 298 participant screen , assume 35 % eligible randomization ; approximately 194 participant randomize . Eligible participant randomize 1:1 one 2 treatment sequence . In sequence 1 participant receive UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg Treatment Period 1 placebo Treatment Period 2 . In sequence 2 participant receive placebo Treatment Period 1 UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg Treatment Period 2 . Treatments deliver once-daily via dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) . Each treatment period 12 week separate wash period 12-17 day . The total duration patient participation , include Follow-Up approximately 30 week . All participant provide albuterol use `` need ( prn ) '' basis throughout run-in , washout study treatment period investigational product .</brief_summary>
