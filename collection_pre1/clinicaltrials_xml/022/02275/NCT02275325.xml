	<brief_summary>Vestibular schwannoma ( VS ) benign tumour Schwann cell surround vestibular nerve , slowly grow within internal auditory canal cerebellopontine angle , lead gradual vestibular dysfunction . The slowly progressive alteration vestibular function allow gradual implementation central adaptive mechanism call vestibular compensation . The total unilateral vestibular deafferentation induce surgical tumour removal suddenly lead decompensation previously compensate situation , explain patient report severe vertigo immediately surgery responsible perturbation postural control ( Parietti-Winkler et al. , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 ) . Recently , Gauchard et al . ( 2013 ) suggest preoperative regular physical activity would limit adverse effect surgical removal balance control . Also , patient benefit faster well postoperative vestibular rehabilitation . Thus , preoperative vestibular rehabilitation , include physical balance exercise , could help limit postoperative balance disorder promote postoperative balance compensation . This could lead decrease duration cost postoperative management faster improvement quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To test hypothesis , measure perceived balance control patient quality life assess two group : one two group receive preoperative vestibular rehabilitation , carry physiotherapist , . The assessment conduct 45 day 3 day surgery , 8 day , 30 day , 90 day 365 day surgery .</detailed_description>
