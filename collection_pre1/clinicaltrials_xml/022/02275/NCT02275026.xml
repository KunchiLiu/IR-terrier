	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand elderly individual regain cognitive skill follow general anesthesia . The investigator compare age stratify group volunteer evaluate series cognitive test functional MRI . The participant administer general anesthesia two hour . The investigator assess participant use state art tool determine participant return cognitive baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trajectory Recovery Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patient undergo anesthesia surgery frequently suffer postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) postoperative delirium ( PD ) . The cause entity unknown . It unclear part anesthetic play development POCD PD . The investigator hypothesize elderly patient 's cognitive capacity recover slowly receive general anesthesia , perhaps limited cognitive reserve . A prolonged recovery would confound diagnosis POCD PD potentially put patient discharge day surgery risk understand postoperative instruction . The trajectory postoperative cognitive recovery never explore elderly participant explicitly include type emergence research . To explore vital area investigator propose study young elderly volunteer combination two state art neuropsychological test ( Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale NIH Toolbox ) functional magnetic resonance imaging . Starting baseline , investigator determine multiple cognitive domain rest state network , treat participant general anesthesia two hour continue examine network activity , explore recovery cognitive domain alteration functional network use PQRS NIH Toolbox Cognitive Measures . Participants evaluate 1 month , 6 month , 12 month .</detailed_description>
