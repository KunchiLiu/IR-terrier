	<brief_summary>The voice indispensable source human communication . Current time put high demand quality voice profession . Organic functional change vocal cord associate insufficiency lead deterioration voice quality , voice fatigue , hoarseness breathing difficulty . This adverse psychological , social economic consequence patient , employer surroundings . The injection technique perform general local anaesthesia . The defined injectable substance insert directly vocal cord , increase volume result almost immediate improvement voice quality . For injection use various material , e.g . autologous fat , calcium hydroxyapatite , silicone , others . Injection techniques less invasive , associate less perioperative morbidity . Operation also perform local anaesthesia select patient , therefore preferred patient multiple comorbidities risk general anaesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Effect Treatment Glottic Insufficiency With Calcium Hydroxyapatite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cause glottic insufficiency ( vocal fold insufficiency ) may paresis ( immobility ) one vocal fold ( iatrogenic aetiology thyroid surgery , neck operation ingrowth malignant tumour chest mediastinum , idiopathic viral infection central neuropathy ) atrophy ( loss mass ) vocal cord , particularly affect old patient . Surgical treatment insufficiency indicate patient conservative treatment ineffective . Surgical treatment vocal fold insufficiency carry two way : - By thyroplasty type I , operation perform mostly general anaesthesia , external access neck insertion silicone block thyroid cartilage space next vocal cord , move medially . - Augmentation vocal cord , insertion ( fat , cartilage , etc . ) foreign ( Gore-Tex , silicone , etc . ) material laterally vocal cord facilitate change position vocal cord . In recent year , so-called augmentation injection technique prefer . While thyroplasty carry Czech Republic 10-15 year , clinician limit experience injection technique , use several year information functional result still insufficient date . The work hypothesis - Augmentation vocal fold hydroxyapatite lead significant improvement subjective objective parameter voice - Augmentation vocal fold hydroxyapatite method comparable method treatment glottic insufficiency ( thyroplasty type 1 , vocal fold augmentation autologous fat ) - Augmentation vocal fold hydroxyapatite perform local anaesthesia The objective study determine functional effect augment vocal fold calcium hydroxyapatite ( `` Radiesse Voice '' ) compare select defined parameter preoperatively postoperatively . Other anticipated benefit study treatment include improve quality life patient ( improved voice quality , breathing , improve mental state , prevent social isolation economic consequence ) . It also lead introduction new process , material method . It also possible expect shorten hospital stay , decrease postoperative morbidity , possibility perform procedure outpatient basis . The study design prospective study , conformity principle guideline Helsinki Declaration , good clinical practice approve Ethical Committee University Hospital Ostrava . The patient enrol study follow period twelve month . Timetable study procedure control : Preoperative examination : - Demographic data age , sex , weight , height , smoking , cause insufficiency - Questionnaires Voice Handicap Index ( VHI ) - Stroboscopy examination ( assessment size insufficiency ) - Voice Analysis ( Vospector Program - Breathable , Hoarseness , total grade dysphonia , Maximum Phonation time , Dysphonia Severity Index - base examination voice range Examination 3 month postoperatively - Questionnaires Voice Handicap Index ( VHI ) - High-speed laryngoscopy , stroboscopy videokymography ( assessment size insufficiency ) - Voice Analysis ( Vospector Program - Breathable , Hoarseness , total grade dysphonia , Maximum Phonation time , Dysphonia Severity Index - base examination voice range Examination 6 month surgery - Questionnaires Voice Handicap Index ( VHI ) - High-speed laryngoscopy , stroboscopy videokymography ( assessment size insufficiency ) - Voice Analysis ( Vospector Program - Breathable , Hoarseness , total grade dysphonia , Maximum Phonation time , Dysphonia Severity Index - base examination voice range . Examination 12 month surgery ( optional examination cooperative patient ) - Questionnaires Voice Handicap Index ( VHI ) - High-speed laryngoscopy , stroboscopy videokymography ( assessment size insufficiency ) - Voice Analysis ( Vospector Program - Breathable , Hoarseness , total grade dysphonia , Maximum Phonation time , Dysphonia Severity Index - base examination voice range . Statistical data processing For statistical evaluation descriptive statistic use ( arithmetical average , standard deflection , frequency table ) , X2 test , Fisher 's exact test , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , calculate OR ( odds ratio ) 95 % confidence interval , logistic regression . Statistical test evaluate significance level 5 % . Statistical analysis perform `` Stata 10 '' programme . Program MS Excel use data collection .</detailed_description>
