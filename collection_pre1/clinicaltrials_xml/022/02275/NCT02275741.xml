	<brief_title>Study Investigate Immune Response Safety Prophylactic Vaccines Patients Treated Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protective vaccine communicable disease major importance patient autoimmune disease impair immune response . In patient multiple sclerosis bacterial viral infection may lead disease progression vaccine protect infection prevent disease progression . Fear possible side effect vaccine lead general restraint regard vaccination patient MS . However , previous study show increased risk disease progression follow Hepatitis B vaccination even reduce progression rate relapsing-remitting MS tetanus/diphtheria vaccination . Various disease modify treatment ( DMT ) available MS , therapy lead impairment immune system affect immune response vaccination . Additionally , live attenuate vaccine may lead severe side-effects used patient DMT treatment . Testing immune response vaccination may prudent subject undergo DMT assure vaccination success since limited number study investigate immune response vaccination patient MS undergo DMT .</detailed_description>
