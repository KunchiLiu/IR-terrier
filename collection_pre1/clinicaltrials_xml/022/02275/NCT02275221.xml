	<brief_title>Immune Response Patients With Hepatitis B C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) C ( HCV ) lead cause liver disease worldwide . Approximately 400 million people worldwide chronically infect HBV world wide estimate 3 % entire world population infect HCV yet still vaccine available . Chronic viral hepatitis infection primarily result complex interaction virus impair host immune response . The host immune response unique role HBV HCV infection contribute viral control clinical recovery protective immunity also development chronic hepatitis liver cirrhosis . There currently cure patient already chronic HBV HCV infection proportion patient fail respond current antiviral regimen . Since patient remain risk disease progression crucial investigate host immune response determine precise role response disease outcome . Using peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) serum collection HBV HCV infect patient number different immunological assay , hope identify change number function immune cell investigate change contribute viral persistence disease progression . This information utilise develop effective treatment regimen order reduce current global burden disease .</detailed_description>
