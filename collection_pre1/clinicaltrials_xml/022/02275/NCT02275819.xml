	<brief_summary>This research study conduct good understand impact exercise training change structure function heart . Exercise training patient heart failure show beneficial decreasing symptom heart failure improve overall functional capacity capacity exercise . However mechanisms responsible still unclear . This study look specifically exercise create change within heart fill ability , heart pump strength well hearts ability rebuild .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training Heart Failure : Changes Cardiac Structure Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence systolic heart failure ( HF ) high among grow population old adult . Progressive cardiac remodel deteriorate cardiac output implicate key factor underlie HF-related exercise intolerance quality life . Even implement medical device therapy moderate remodeling , exercise tolerance remain impaired . While exercise training demonstrate improve exercise capacity , mechanism facilitate benefit remain unclear . Peripheral adaptation skeletal muscle vasculature provide least benefit , however reverse cardiac remodeling ( beyond effect pharmacological device therapy ) may additive . The investigator propose study impact 2 different type exercise cardiac morphology well systolic diastolic performance relate functional gain . The investigator compare traditional aerobic training novel regimen inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) . IMT specific type exercise training may particularly useful frail , infirmed HF patient unlikely tolerate aerobic training . Effects IMT remodel previously study . The propose echocardiography pilot study build fund VA Merit F0834-R `` Exercise Therapy Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms ; Sorting Mechanisms Benefit '' ( Exercise therapy ) PI , Forman compare different mode exercise train old ( age 50yrs ) systolic ( EF 45 % ) HF patient . The original study assess peripheral mechanism affect exercise training , design assess cardiac remodeling . The propose pilot study provide vital complementary analysis , i.e. , add assessment cardiac remodel well relate change systolic diastolic performance .</detailed_description>
