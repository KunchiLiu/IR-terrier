	<brief_title>Redes III Patient Navigator Qol Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hispanic/Latinos ( HL ) large fastest-growing minority population nation . HLs generally low survival rate cancer , even account difference age stage distribution , may reflect less access timely , high-quality treatment . They also experience disproportionately high health disparity quality care access care . The experience cancer survivorship often characterize significant challenge . Despite challenge significant disparity observe among HLs , limit knowledge survivorship-related issue priority among HLs , specifically effectiveness use promotores/patient navigator ( PN ) link HL cancer survivor unmet psychosocial need appropriate psychosocial service . The exist community-based infrastructure Lance Armstrong Foundation ( LAF ) LIVESTRONG Cancer Navigation Services ( LCNS ) PN program provide excellent opportunity evaluate efficacy improve QOL among HLs . This propose 5-year Redes En Acción research study involve mixed-methods approach occur two phase across two distinct diverse HL community . Phase I use community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach engage community-based partner provide service breast , colorectal prostate HL cancer survivor . In phase , investigator gather community partner action-oriented group meeting site present component target combine PN LCNS PN program ( PNLCNS ) . Through CBPR approach generate valuable community feedback , investigator enhance role PN , develop extend exist cooperative relationship facilitate participant recruitment , prepare community-based partner disseminate implement PNLCNS program upon establish efficacy propose randomize control trial ( RCT ) Phase II . Phase II test RCT evaluate efficacy culturally tailored PNLCNS program improve general disease-specific quality life ( QOL ) treatment follow-up compliance among breast , colorectal prostate HL cancer survivor . Phase II also evaluate extent intervention-associated improvement outcomes mediate target PNLCNS program ( e.g. , communication medical team , meet unmet need improve health behavior ) . The RCT involve 2 X 4 randomize repeated measure design experimental condition ( combined patient navigation [ PN ] 3 month access LCNS PN service [ PNLCNS ] vs. PN condition ) between-groups factor , time-point ( baseline/pre-randomization [ T1 ] ; post-PNLCNS [ 3-months post-T1 ; T2 ] , 6- [ T3 ] 12-months [ T4 ] follow-up post-T2 ) within-groups factor ; total follow-up 15 month . The investigator compare effect PNLCNS PN condition QOL treatment follow-up compliance 300 ( attrition ; n=100 , Chicago n=100 , San Antonio ) breast , colorectal prostate HL cancer survivor evidence metastatic disease . To understand mechanism PNLCNS significantly impact QOL treatment compliance outcome , investigator also examine change unmet cancer need , communication medical team , health behavior , psychological distress , worry , cop general self-efficacy potential mediator intervention effect . The investigator also evaluate extent factor preparation consultation ( i.e. , medical visit ) satisfaction cancer care associate QOL treatment follow-up compliance outcome . Study finding fill significant gap understand extent PN program exist community-based resource target survivor improve QOL grow number HL cancer survivor experience unequal burden unmet need cancer treatment . The efficacy propose RCT provide conceptually sound clinically relevant approach address need HL cancer survivor integrate evidence-based practice exist community resource infrastructure , thus facilitate dissemination translation study finding Phase I 's CBPR process .</detailed_description>
