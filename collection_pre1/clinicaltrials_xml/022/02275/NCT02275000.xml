	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Physiotherapy Functional Motor Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit outpatient neurology clinic Queen Square . Those consent take part complete baseline outcome measure ( Time 1 ) randomise either Treatment Usual control group Intervention group . Treatment Usual group - 1 .

The physiotherapy intervention take place physiotherapy department . Participants admit individually ( group ) . Outside physiotherapy time participant encourage rest day hospital complete workbook . A single independent physiotherapist train deliver intervention . The participant ( +/- family member ) attend initial meeting consultant neurologist treat physiotherapist . The neurologist perform brief neurological assessment confirm diagnosis . 1 . The diagnosis explain patient , use word `` functional '' describe diagnosis . 2 . Physical sign FMS demonstrate patient . This include distractibility , Hoover 's sign entrainment . 3 . The treatment programme explain patient , link resolution symptom treatment rationale . 4 . The participant attend 8-9 physiotherapy session 5 day . The intervention combination education functional motor symptom , movement retrain development self management plan . 5 . After final physiotherapy session , participant complete outcome measure ( Time 2 ) feedback form . Both group follow 6 month recruitment study ( Time 3 ) .
