	<brief_summary>Nutrient deficiency occur frequently IBD patient . The absorption rate nutrient IBD often limit chronic inflammation , also commonly reduce miss intestinal segment due previous operation . Patients predominantly affect malnutrition , often resemble weight loss , specific micronutrient deficit iron deficiency , vitamin B12 deficiency , folic acid deficiency , vitamin D deficiency zinc depletion . The etiology nutritional problem multifactorial exclusively limited active phase disease . Causes malnutrition inadequate food intake , maldigestion , malabsorption increase nutritional requirement . Malnutrition associate delayed recovery impair wound healing , reduce quality life longer hospital stay . Therefore , observation modification nutritional status integral part therapy IBD patient . The primary objective study investigate influence disease rest energy expenditure nutritional status acute inflammation clinical remission disease . Secondary objective ass possible nutritional deficiency . On hand well know patient IBD increase risk coronary heart disease . Therefore , another secondary focus observational study whether composition HDL proteins change towards pro-atherogenic HDL-proteins whether possible change occur patient clinical remission active disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective study investigate influence disease activity rest energy expenditure nutritional status patient chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . The impact IBD nutritional status rest energy expenditure currently fully understood . IBD include two different disease entity , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Both characterized diarrhea , loss weight , rectal bleed abdominal discomfort ( abdominal pain , flatulence ) . In patient IBD malabsorption , one-sided nutritional behavior , food abandonment , malnutrition , nutrient deficiency weight loss common issue . Malnutrition associate delayed recovery , impair wound healing , reduce quality life prolong hospital stay . The malnutrition limit active disease state . Rates malnutrition patient Crohn ` disease range 20 - 85 % . Hence , assessment nutritional status important treatment patient IBD . Different method use assess impact disease activity nutritional status . To investigate rest energy expenditure well evaluate indirect calorimetry use . The principle measurement base determination oxygen absorption inspiration simultaneous determination release carbon dioxide expiration . The use bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) widespread measurement ass composition body . BIA allow determination fat-free mass , total body water , body cell mass , fat mass extracellular mass . Both measurement non-invasive reproducible . Additionally different blood parameter determine HDL-subgroups , vitamin b12 , folic acid , vitamin K , vitamin D , 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 , zinc , ferritin , albumin , citrulline routine laboratory ( blood count , serum chemistry , coagulation ) . Moreover quality life measure suitable questionnaire ( Gastrointestinal Life Quality Index ) well subjective global assessment estimate nutritional status . Furthermore , secondary aim study investigate correlation HDL-subgroups severity IBD activity . High-Density-Lipoproteins heterogeneous group lipoproteins anti-atherogenic multiple anti-inflammatory property . Recent research show quality HDL-particle even important quantity . It could show change composition HDL could cause inflammatory status thus affect activity chronic inflammatory disease . Therefore , aim study investigate change composition HDL-proteins towards pro-atherogenic HDL-proteins exist . The study take place University Hospital Muenster , Germany . Patients suitable participate study measure counseled regular out-clinic visit . Each patient undergo procedure active state disease remission . It expect include 200 patient 2 year .</detailed_description>
