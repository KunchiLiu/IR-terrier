	<brief_summary>Phase I-II trial combine trabectedin plus radiotherapy tumor reduction response measure two cohort patient : Cohort A : Patients diagnosis non-operable unresectable oncologically recommended metastasectomy limit lung metastasis soft tissue sarcoma . Cohort B : Patients locally advance resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma . Phase I : escalate dose 1.3 1.5 mg/m2 . Radiotherapy cohort A : 30Gy 10 fraction ( 3Gy/fraction ) Radiotherapy cohort B : 45Gy 25 fraction ( 1.8Gy/fraction ) A translational substudy develop analyse different biomarkers predictive value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Trial , Multicenter , Open , Exploring Trabectedin Plus Radiotherapy Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study investigator plan measure tumor response ( RECIST Choi criterion ) administer trabectedin standard dose inferior simultaneous radiotherapy treatment . The hypothesis state administer trabectedin 1.3mg/m2 ≤1.5mg/m2 plus Radiotherapy 30-45Gy show synergic activity turn tumor shrinkage . A phase I trial ( dose escalation level 1.3 1.5 mg/m2 ) provide proper dose level perform phase II trial measure RECIST Choi response , progression free survival , overall survival register safety quality life detail . To cohort indicate trial , A : Patients diagnosis non-operable unresectable oncologically recommended metastasectomy limit lung metastasis soft tissue sarcoma cohort B : Patients locally advance resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma . Unlimited cycle chemotherapy consider beneficial cohort A patient , whereas cohort B 3 cycle indicate . About radiotherapy treatment , 30Gy give cohort A patient , whereas cohort B receive 45Gy . TCs MRI select imaging purpose . Several biomarkers select perform FFPE tumor assay relation prediction</detailed_description>
