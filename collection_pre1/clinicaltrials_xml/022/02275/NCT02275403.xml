Patients arm study receive standard medication manage symptom CIPN , determine clinician accordance local trust policy . In addition , patient randomise treatment arm receive 40 minute session acupuncture weekly basis 10 week . All patient offer acupuncture , commence trial end 10 week study period . Outcome measure focus assess impact acupuncture patient ' quality life , symptom burden CIPN quantify effect size . There also preliminary health economic evaluation cost effectiveness . The data disseminate addition use establish whether large , multisite trial confirm efficacy across diagnostic group , user acceptability cost effectiveness appropriate . This work facilitate team validate study protocol design template multicentre study confirm user acceptability approach additional qualitative data collect focus group work completion study participation .</detailed_description>
