	<detailed_description>Study Design This randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled early phase II clinical trial . Recruitment : The study 2 phase . The first testing intranasal treatment ( oxytocin [ OT ] , placebo ) alcohol withdrawal ( inpatient phase ) second test intranasal treatment alcohol drinking , crave anxiety 12 week outpatient setting ( outpatient phase ) . Subjects inpatient phase recruit patient admit Freedom House ( FRH , mental health center Chapel Hill , NC ) medical detoxification alcohol within last 36 hour . Subjects outpatient phase study inpatient FRH University North Carolina ( UNC ) Hospitals near end inpatient stay ( medical detoxification nearly complete ) . Subjects inpatient phase study FRH may continue outpatient phase discharge . Subjects outpatient phase also heavy drinker community screen initial outpatient clinic visit . Patients newly admit FRH treat alcohol withdrawal undergo brief screen include : 1 ) recent past alcohol use interview ( Time Line Follow Back , TLFB ) history alcohol withdrawal interview ; 2 ) brief psychiatric interview ; 3 ) score 10-item CIWA scale alcohol withdrawal symptom ; 4 ) review potential medical exclusion criterion include history seizure delirium tremens ; 5 ) spot urine pregnancy test prospective female subject . Recruitment outpatient phase ( treatment outpatient drinking ) : Patients undergo medical detoxification alcohol recruit FRH UNC Hospitals toward end admission participation trial test efficacy intranasal OT vs. placebo treatment alcohol drinking , alcohol crave anxiety 12-week outpatient treatment period . They screen see meet study criterion . These individual read sign Breath Alcohol Policy state Breathalyzer read begin outpatient clinic visit &gt; .08 assess visit drive home rather accept ride family member , friend cab driver . Other individual recruit community participation outpatient phase study respond radio ad , UNC listserve ad , flyer , refer local clinician otherwise become aware study . These prospective subject undergo telephone screen interview . If appear meet criterion phone , screen outpatient clinic visit . They must sign Breath Alcohol Policy . Inpatient Treatment Withdrawal Protocol Measures : Subjects enroll study shortly admit FRH immediately complete State portion Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( SSTAI ) Penn Alcohol Craving Scale ( PACS ) . This follow self-administration first intranasal test dose supervision research personnel . These subject self-administer additional intranasal test dose 1 3 h initial dose even first day admission . On subsequent admission day FRH , subject self-administer intranasal test dose 3 time per day . After first intranasal test dose , blood ( 15 ml ) urine sample obtain subject FRH research personnel complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrolytes , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , glucose , albumin , liver function test , urinalysis urine toxicology transport run UNC Hospital laboratory . Between 1st 3rd initial intranasal test dos , research personnel complete detailed psychiatric interview . Subjects also complete University Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale ass stage motivation stop cut back drinking , Drinker 's Inventory Consequences ass spectrum consequence related drinking , Family History Alcoholism Module ass family history alcohol problem , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ ) ass symptom depression Demographic Questionnaire . During first 2 inpatient day , vital sign CIWA score obtain ( FRH personnel ) every 4 hour whenever subject report nurse observe onset withdrawal symptom . On 3rd inpatient day , measure obtain 3 time . And subsequent inpatient day , measure obtain day whenever withdrawal symptom increase . Subjects complete PACS SSTAI prior administration 2nd test dose inpatient day start day enter study . Blood draw early inpatient day 3 electrolyte measurement . In subject participate inpatient phase study , lorazepam ( 2 mg ) , standard medication decrease withdrawal symptom , administer mouth ( PO ) whenever CIWA score ≥ 7 . CIWA score repeat 1 h lorazepam dose another dose give CIWA score remain ≥ 7 . Also , lorazepam ( 2 mg ) administer subject find follow elevated vital sign ( even CIWA score remain low ) : pulse &gt; 110 ; diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 ; systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 . Vital sign ( well CIWA ) repeat 1 h lorazepam dose another dose give elevate measure persist . If subject 's CIWA score remain ≥ 7 , pulse remain &gt; 110 diastolic blood pressure remain &gt; 100 8 consecutive lorazepam dos , systolic blood pressure remain &gt; 160 3 lorazepam dos , CIWA score steadily increase despite receive 3 consecutive lorazepam dose dangerous symptom develop ( e.g. , onset hallucination ) , aggressive detoxification regimen initiate subject drop study . All patient admit FRH alcohol detoxification receive thiamine , folate multivitamin supplementation . Initiating Outpatient Test Treatment : Subjects recruit outpatient phase study end inpatient admission medical detoxification alcohol randomize treatment group begin intranasal test treatment first outpatient clinic visit discharge FRH UNC Hospitals . Subjects recruit community randomize begin intranasal test treatment outpatient clinic visit schedule shortly screen clinic visit assessment latter visit indicate meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Several measure obtain begin clinic visit subject begin self-administration test treatment : Breathalyzer reading , CIWA rating , TLFB interview assessment recent alcohol consumption , self-ratings SSTAI PACS . Research personnel instruct subject intranasal self-administration technique observe subject take first intranasal test dose . Subjects give write instruction intranasal self-administration technique , clean spray bottle nozzle dose , store spray bottle dose contact study personnel question , difficulty self-administration procedure may experience side effect . At end clinic visit , subject take home 60 ml spray bottle ( eject 0.1 ml meter dose per insufflation ) contain 25 ml test solution use self-administer test treatment dos twice daily ( 6 insufflations/dose ) . Outpatient clinic visit treatment period : Subjects follow-up outpatient clinic visit week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 start intranasal test treatment . Outpatient visit take place Psychiatry Clinics UNC Neurosciences Hospital Alcohol Substance Abuse Program ( ASAP ) clinic locate UNC campus bus line make convenient participant commute park thereby facilitate compliance outpatient portion study . To enhance continuity , first visit 2-3 day clinic visit intranasal test treatment start . At clinic visit , Breathalyzer reading , CIWA score vital sign obtain , TLFB interview administer quantify daily alcohol intake since last clinic visit , SSTAI , PACS PHQ questionnaires complete . Subjects give fresh 60 ml intranasal spray bottle contain 25 ml test substance clinic visit every 2 week . At clinic visit , subject ' spray bottle weigh monitor compliance . Their intranasal self-administration technique review , necessary , subject reinstructed proper technique . At 4 , 8 12 week , blood drawn CBC , liver function , electrolyte , BUN , creatinine , urine sample obtain drug screen pregnancy test female subject . During clinic visit , 15 minute substance use counseling ( Medical Management ) provide .</detailed_description>
