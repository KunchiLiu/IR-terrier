	<brief_summary>Leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) complication THA may result patient dissatisfaction , gait disorder , great trochanter pain , low back pain . In literature , LLD report vary widely among study e.g . 6 35 mm . However , threshold LLD clinically important still matter debate . The aim study determine influence non-corrected LLD THA patient ' report hip function quality life . This prospective cohort study conduct Sundsvall Teaching Hospital Sweden approve regional ethic committee Ume√• University ( No . 07-052M No . 12-287-32M ) . Between September 2010 April 2013 , patient unilateral primary osteoarthritis ( OA ) treat THA consider inclusion . Informed consent obtain patient . Patients secondary OA , previous spinal , pelvic , low limb injury fracture exclude . The primary outcome measure Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis ( WOMAC ) Index measure functional outcome ( ref ) . The secondary outcome measure EQ-5D visual analogue scale ( VAS ) scale . Patients assess preoperatively follow-up 1 year postoperatively . The posterolateral approach use operation . LLD measure postoperative x-ray . patient divide three group : shorten group operate leg 5mm shorter compare contralateral side , restoration control group operate leg within 5mm shorten 9mm lengthening compare contralateral side , lengthen group operate leg become 9mm long compare contralateral side .</brief_summary>
