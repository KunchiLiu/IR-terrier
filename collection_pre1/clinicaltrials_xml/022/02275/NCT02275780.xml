	<brief_summary>To establish new treatment option treatment-naïve participant HIV-1 , efficacy safety doravirine determine relative protease inhibitor ( PI ) . Participants receive double-blind treatment 96-week Base Study . Eligible participant either Base Study group continue receive doravirine-containing regimen open label additional 96 week Extension Study . The primary hypothesis doravirine 100 mg day ( q.d . ) non-inferior darunavir/ritonavir ( 800 mg/100 mg ) q.d. , combination TRUVADA™ EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™ , assess proportion participant HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 48 . If non-inferiority establish , superiority doravirine 100 mg q.d . compare darunavir/ ritonavir ( 800 mg/100 mg ) q.d . assess .</brief_summary>
