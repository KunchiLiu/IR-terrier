	<brief_title>Nivolumab Eliminating Minimal Residual Disease Preventing Relapse Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Remission After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate compare progression free survival rate randomization two treatment arm ( nivolumab versus [ vs. ] observation ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine compare overall survival rate two arm . II . To determine compare incidence non-relapse mortality two arm . III . To evaluate toxicity nivolumab maintenance . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze programmed cell death ( PD ) -ligand ( L ) 1 expression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell peripheral blood and/or bone marrow sample diagnosis available time study enrollment . II . To monitor AML minimal residual disease ( MRD ) Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) enrollment subsequent define time point nivolumab-treated control group . III . To perform exploratory analysis frequency , absolute number subset T cell ( include regulatory T cell ) nivolumab-treated control group emphasis activation marker . IV . To perform deep sequence T cell receptor ( TCR ) -alpha TCR-beta chain polyclonal T cell baseline subsequent time point nivolumab control group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute every 2 week . Treatment repeat every 2 week 46 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo standard care clinical observation 2 year . Upon disease relapse , patient may cross-over Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
