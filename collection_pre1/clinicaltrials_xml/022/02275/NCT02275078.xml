	<brief_summary>The purpose project conduct pilot study evaluate feasibility potential benefit phone assessment/reporting system ( tele-system ) addition write action plan nurse case manager support improve patient ' adherence COPD treatment risk exacerbation . Primary objective : explore potential benefit respect patient 's adherence , i.e. , prompt use antibiotic and/or prednisone event exacerbation , increase adherence maintenance medication ; increase patient 's self-efficacy '' self-managing disease ; use efficiently program resource , i.e. , case-manager . Secondary objective : To assess proportion patient effectively self manage exacerbation use COPD Action Plan To assess self management COPD patient respect increase adherence regular respiratory medication , ( SmartInhaler electronic monitoring ) ; To assess increased self-efficacy COPD patient identify manage exacerbation ( baseline vs 12 month ) ; To assess symptoms recovery , health status improvement , prevention ER visit hospital admission COPD exacerbation . To assess efficiency use program resource , To evaluate feasibility treatment approach provide pilot data ( need large multi-centre clinical trial ; To evaluate feasibility need assessment exacerbation onset , health-related quality life physical activity ; To evaluate safety approach ; term delay start prednisone unfavourable outcome ( ER visit and/or hospitalization ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) 4th lead cause death Canada chronic disease mortality rate continue climb . Acute exacerbation common.Unfortunately , exacerbation often view trivial event `` simple bronchitis '' despite link accelerated lung function decline , poor health , hospital admission premature death.Conversely , prompt treatment reduces recovery time , improve health status , decrease hospital admissions.In patient , exacerbation manage either primary care walk-in clinic emergency department ( ED ) , result suboptimal management high utilization costs.Furthermore , less severe exacerbation ( ~60 % ) remain unreported untreated , although likely significant negative impact health . In Canada , quality indicator suggest chronic disease management remain suboptimal , especially COPD . RATIONALE : In COPD clinic , investigator group others show patient learn self-monitor manage acute exacerbation follow COPD Action Plan good health outcome low rate health care utilization ( unplanned office visit , ED use , hospital admission ) . Key element effective self-management program include write Action Plan , stand order exacerbation medication ( antibiotics/prednisone ) , self-management skill training combined access nurse case manager support . However , program time resource intensive hence challenge implement across practice , especially specialize . Recent advance patient-provider communication technology , interactive phone system , show promise help inform motivate patient asthma , diabetes hypertension effectively self monitor symptom well self-manage diseases.Communication technology offer new opportunity develop chronic disease self-management program easily implement less likely place additional burden busy practice .</detailed_description>
