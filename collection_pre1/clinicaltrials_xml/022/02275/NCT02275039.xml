	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect recommend dose combination p53MVA vaccine ( modify vaccinia virus ankara vaccine express tumor protein p53 [ p53 ] ) gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer come back . Vaccines make insert laboratory-treated gene person 's tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express p53 . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving modify vaccinia virus ankara vaccine express p53 together gemcitabine hydrochloride may work well treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>p53MVA Vaccine Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommend dose combination p53MVA vaccine gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) well-tolerated patient platinum resistant , p53 express ovarian cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate T cell immunity change clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive modify vaccinia virus ankara vaccine express p53 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 15 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm , epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer experience recurrence progression within 12 month completion platinum base chemotherapy ; patient must measurable disease detectable disease : Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) ; lesion must great equal 10 mm measure computerized tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; lymph node must great equal 15 mm short axis measure CT , PET/CT MRI Detectable disease patient define one measurable disease , least one follow condition : Baseline value cancer antigen125 ( CA125 ) least 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Ascites and/or pleural effusion attribute tumor Solid and/or cystic abnormality radiographic image meet modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , immunerelated response criterion ( irRC ) target lesion Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 06 month follow platinumbased chemotherapy platinum resistant disease ; patient eligible trial Patients document disease recurrence/progression within 612 month complete platinumbased therapy , consider 'borderline ' platinum sensitivity ; patient eligible trial agree patient treat physician Patients relapse 12 month completion platinumbased treatment consider 'platinum sensitive ' eligible trial Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; = 60 % ) Patients must life expectancy least 3 month Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/ul Platelets &gt; = 100,000/ul ; low platelet count may correct transfusion achieve eligibility study The hemoglobin level must great 9 g/dL ; low hemoglobin count may correct transfusion achieve eligibility study Calculated measured creatinine clearance &gt; = 50 ml/min serum creatinine = &lt; 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) = &lt; 3 time institutional upper normal level ( AST ALT = &lt; 5 time institutional upper normal level , evidence liver metastasis ) Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry six month follow duration study participation ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate trial , inform treat physician immediately Patients confirm p53 mutation molecular analysis and/or evidence p53 overexpression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ( &gt; = 10 % cell within tumor stain positive ) eligible ; assess semiquantitatively Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) approve pathology core pathologist , use CLIA approve mutational analysis immunohistochemistry technique formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue ; case equivocal IHC result , p53 involvement may confirm detection p53 molecular analysis tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ; patient molecular analysis p53 mutation already available , require IHC analysis ;
