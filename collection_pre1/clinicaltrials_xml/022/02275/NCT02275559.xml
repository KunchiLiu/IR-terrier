But low congruence patient ' symptom report pulmonary function lead disease management error . The accuracy asthma patient recognize symptom affect emotional factor , high negative affectivity relate low interoceptive accuracy bad asthma symptom asthma physical health , frequent mental distress prevalent among asthmatic think result difficulty distinguish symptom stress/distress asthma . Mindfulness training teach people recognize distinguish among component experience ( thought , feeling , sensations/symptoms ) associate increase perceptual accuracy respiratory resistance , reduce affective negativity .

Promising improvement percentage patient well-controlled asthma also find . All improvement sustain 10 month post-intervention . Widespread adoption promise adjunct intervention require sharp evidence regard asthma control symptom . The primary aim test MBSR active control key clinical outcome asthma control symptom use gold standard measure 256 adult mild , moderate severe asthma . And evaluate program 's effect asthma QOL , lung function , cost-effectiveness , mediate effect respiratory interoceptive accuracy asthma control , QOL , medication use . Assessments baseline , 6- , 12- , 18-month follow-up . MBSR available nationwide cover many third-party payer . If sustain credible improvement asthma control symptom find , MBSR could useful adjunct traditional medical treatment would potential improve life people asthma . By examine mediate effect psychosocial variable asthma control , study also generate new knowledge mechanism change maintenance mind-body behavioral program medicine .</detailed_description>
