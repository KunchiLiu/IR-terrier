	<brief_title>Comparison Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography ( CESM ) MRI Screening High Risk Women Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study do test well contrast enhance mammogram compare MRI screen breast cancer people high risk develop breast cancer . Standard screen mammogram miss breast cancer due inability `` see '' dense breast tissue . For reason , woman increase risk development breast cancer often undergo additional screening beyond conventional mammography magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Although screen MRI sensitive finding breast cancer , also find many area benign ( cancer ) . The way know cancer perform biopsy , contribute patient anxiety lead many unnecessary biopsy . In preliminary study perform woman already diagnose breast cancer , contrast enhance mammography show similar sensitivity find primary breast cancer detect few benign finding would result few unnecessary biopsy . It also faster less expensive exam compare MRI . Contrast mammography FDA approve 2011 use tool help work-up abnormality see standard mammography ultrasound . We study see contrast enhanced mammography also beneficial tool screen set screen high risk patient breast cancer .</detailed_description>
