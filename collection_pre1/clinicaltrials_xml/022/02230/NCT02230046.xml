	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Abiraterone Acetate Coated Uncoated Tablet Formulations Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-center , single-dose 3-way Crossover ( medication provide participant different sequence ) pivotal study determine bioequivalence 2 abiraterone acetate coat tablet formulation respect current commercial abiraterone acetate uncoated tablet formulation . Approximately 102 healthy male participant participate study . Participants randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase ( within 21 day first study drug administration first period ) , open-label treatment Phase consist 3 single-dose treatment period ( 45 day ) follow-up Phase ( 5 7 day last study procedure ) . The total study duration participant 45 day maximum 61 day . Participants receive single oral 1000 milligram ( mg ) dose abiraterone acetate fast condition either Treatment A ( current commercial formulation , uncoated ) , Treatment B ( current commercial formulation , coat ) Treatment C ( new composition , coat ) . Bioequivalence primarily evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
