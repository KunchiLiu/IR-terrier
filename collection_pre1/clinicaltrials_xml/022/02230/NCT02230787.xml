	<brief_summary>Enamel matrix protein show play crucial role tooth development support tissue . This used periodontal surgery regeneration lose tissue around teeth intend . Emdogain , product Straumann Institute contain matrix protein successfully use regenerative periodontal surgery 16 year . The treatment gum recession common requirement , patient seek treatment investigator ' clinic due aesthetic concern , root sensitivity difficulty perform adequate oral hygiene . The standard treatment comprise transplantation piece connective tissue palate denude root surface . In many case Emdogain additionally apply enhance healing . So far effect Emdogain early wind heal process surgical root coverage investigate . The purpose investigator ' study compare early wound heal parameter treatment without Emdogain . For study 40 patient undergoing root coverage surgery investigator ' department include . Early wound heal feature two group describe compare . Furthermore , inflammatory marker typical early healing evaluate together patient ` subjective postoperative comfort . Finally , outcomes 6 month treatment assess . The investigator ' hypothesis Emdogain treatment enhances wind heal decrease post-operative complication rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gingival Recession Coverage With Without Emdogain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Effect Emdogain wound heal gingival recession coverage use connective tissue graft : pilot study Emdogain Treatment Emdogain ( Institute Straumann , Basel Switzerland ) enamel matrix protein derivative vehicle propylene glycol alginate . Emdogain use 16 year regenerative periodontal treatment intrabony , class II furcation recession defect . Animal human histological study provide evidence periodontal regeneration ( e.g . formation root cementum , periodontal ligament alveolar bone ) follow application Emdogain conjunction periodontal surgery . The use Emdogain show significantly improve clinical outcome evidence probe depth reduction , clinical attachment gain consider today routine procedure . Background Therapy buccal gingival recession common indication treatment order improve plaque control thus prevent gingivitis root caries also improve aesthetic root sensitivity . The ultimate goal root coverage procedure complete coverage root surface , time , obtain similar appearance regenerate soft tissue surround intact tissue . The use palatal connective tissue graft conjunction coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) well establish clinical procedure treatment gingival recession . Its use show result predictable root coverage , high increase keratinize tissue stable long-term outcome compare use CAF consider today state art . Furthermore , recent data also appear indicate combination Emdogain CTG may additionally improve clinical outcome . Therefore , standard surgical procedure treatment gingival recession Department Periodontology include use connective tissue graft either without use Emdogain . Interestingly , despite fact Emdogain commonly use , information effect upon early wound heal available . Hence , aim study evaluate effect Emdogain early wind healing , assess mean clinical parameter inflammatory marker follow recession coverage surgery . Study population methodology Patient group compare : treatment group , patient undergo recession coverage surgery treat Emdogain whereas control group , patient receive Emdogain . A total 40 patient , 20 group include . Preoperative inflammatory marker assess preoperative examination two day surgery dip paper point crevicular fluid . Furthermore investigator ass whether remnant Emdogain still traceable two day surgery . Wound heal root coverage procedure assess use `` early wound heal index ( EHI ) '' define Wachtel et al . According Wachtel et al. , wound heal quantify graded 5 stage . Additionally , post-operative healing process judge patient questionnaire . Finally root coverage measure distance CEJ ( Cemento Enamel Junction ) Margo Gingivae mm . Objective 1 . To investigate benefit intraoperative use Emdogain early wind heal first two week gingival recession coverage . Early wound heal parameter assess site explantation tissue graft well site implantation . 2 . To investigate effect Emdogain inflammatory marker crevicular fluid whether Emdogain traceable two day application . 3 . To investigate influence post-operative pain interference daily activity first two week ( patient 's questionnaire ) . 4 . The post-operative result also assess 6 month . Methods The present prospective study include total 40 patient , 20 patient 2 group ( Emdogain group control group ) . All procedure elective procedure . After oral write informed consent , study comprise collection crevicular fluid sample clinical data well fill patient questionnaire . The study conduct randomized prospective study . In treatment group procedure perform Emdogain , control group , root coverage perform without , respectively . All procedure perform one experience operator . Patients treated standard surgical procedure University Bern . In patient group Emdogain , tissue graft explantation site cover Emdogain , patient group without Emdogain , Emdogain use . After inclusion patient , study duration last 6 month patient .</detailed_description>
