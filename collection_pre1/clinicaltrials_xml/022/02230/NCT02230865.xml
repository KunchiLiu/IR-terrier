	<brief_summary>Pain expect part surgical recovery effective pain management remain challenge . The high variability postoperative pain experience analgesic treatment response patient part challenge . Few study yet combine preoperative assessment response experimental pain measurement cognitive emotional process prediction postoperative pain . We hypothesize , preoperative evoke brain potential ( use standard electroencephalographic brain imaging ) , endogenous pain inhibition capacity ( condition pain modulation ) , responses pressure/thermal pain stimulation , and/or situational pain-related catastrophic think useful clinical predictor postoperative pain analgesic consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preselected preoperative predictor variables/individual patient characteristic include follow : - Evoked brain potential ( use standard electroencephalographic brain imaging ) - Capacity descend pain inhibition induce cold pressor test ( 2C 120 sec ) - Pressure pain detection tolerance threshold muscle ( m.quadriceps ) - Pressure pain tolerance threshold bone ( sternum tibia ) - Heat pain tolerance threshold skin ( forearm ) - Responses Situational Dispositional Pain Catastrophizing Scale - Response State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Response Beck 's Depression Inventory</detailed_description>
