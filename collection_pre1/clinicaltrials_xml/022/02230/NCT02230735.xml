	<brief_title>Bupivacaine Injections Into Uterosacral Ligaments During Robotic Assisted Total Hysterectomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gynecologists use paracervical block office decrease pain office base procedure . Paracervical block , office , work inject cervix local anesthetic , typically lidocaine , area uterosacral ligament . The uterosacral ligament contain uterine nerve , branch level T12-L2 . By inject uterine nerve local anesthetic patient well able tolerate procedure decrease pain post procedure . In office , paracervical block perform vaginally injection 3 o'clock 9 o'clock position cervix . The use paracervical block Chudnoff et al review effectiveness paracervical block office base procedure , however one evaluate effectiveness inject uterosacral ligament direct visualization camera place abdomen robotic assist gynecologic procedure . We propose inject uterosacral ligament thus uterine nerve robotic assisted hysterectomy Marcaine ( Bupivacaine 0.5 % epinephrine 1:200,000 ) offer patient superior pain relief . The onset action Marcaine rapid anesthesia long lasting . The duration anesthesia significantly long Marcaine commonly use local anesthetic . It also note period analgesia persist return sensation , time need strong analgesic reduce . By inject Marcaine hypothesize patient decrease pain need less narcotic pain medication . This allow patient return normal activity daily live sooner . This randomize control double blind trial patient assign receive saline ( control group ) bupivacaine 0.5 % epinephrine 1:200,000 ( treatment group ) . The randomization perform computerized system pharmacy pharmacy hospital study occur . The randomization occur patient consent study . The treatment arm study receive total injection 14ml bupivacaine 7ml direct right uterosacral ligament 7ml leave uterosacral ligament . The control arm study receive total injection 14ml normal saline 7ml direct right uterosacral ligament 7ml leave uterosacral ligament . These injection take place uterus cervix surgically remove vaginal cuff surgically close . The maximum dose bupivacaine epinephrine 225mg . The total amount bupivacaine choose inject maximum allowable dose yet believe adequate amount provide pain relief . Eligible patient consent study preoperative hold area . Once consented patient give medication diary form take home . The form ask patient fill name pain medication prescribe dosage . They also area tally number pill take since discharged hospital . If take anything pain prescribe physician perform surgery patient take study . The Wong-baker face pain rating scale include form use rate pain telephone encounter . The pharmacy notify consent obtain patient participate study . After , injectable solution send OR label `` Study Drug . '' The surgical team patient blind arm assign . With use Bierman needle solution inject uterine nerve course uterosacral ligament side level vaginal cuff . If uterosacral ligament easily identify , patient exclude study . Follow take place via telephone encounter .</detailed_description>
