	<brief_summary>This study first randomize , open-label , national , multicenter , phase II study assess efficacy safety OCLU subject pretreated progressive pancreatic , inoperable , somatostatin receptor positive , well differentiate pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( WDpNET ) . Subjects must experience documented progression disease within 1 year prior start study . The control group patient receive Sutent use internal control assess hypothesis 12 month PFS equal 35 % patient receive Sutent .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically proven review well differentiate malignant pancreatic sporadic NET Metastatic disease amenable surgical resection At least 2/3 RECIST lesion , include measurable non measurable lesion positive ( grade uptake SRS ≥ 2 : equal liver ) somatostatin receptor scintigraphy within 24 week prior enrollment . Post first line whatever type systemic therapy : cytotoxic chemotherapy everolimus somatostatine analog . In case Sandostatine LAR Somatuline therapy give anti tumoral purpose , attempt make demonstrate progression sandostatine LAR 30 mg Somatuline LP 120 alone . Evaluable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion ( Appendix 2 ) Progressing disease within 12 month prior randomization accord RECIST 1.1 criterion ; ECOG performance status 02 ( appendix 9 ) Life expectancy ≥ 6 month prognosticate physician Age ≥ 18 year , superior limit Adequate bone marrow reserve ( Hb &gt; 8 , neutrophil ≥ 1500/mm³ platelet ≥80.000/mm^3 ) Effective contraception premenopausal female male patient least 6 month posttreatment . Patient´s sign write informed consent Ability comply protocol procedures Ability take oral medication Patient affiliate social security system beneficiary . Large small cellpoorly differentiate pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor accord WHO 2010 classification Any patient receiving treatment shortacting Octreotide , interrupt 24 h 24 h administration 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate , patient receive treatment Octreotide LAR , interrupt least 6 week administration 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate , unless OctreoScan® image continued Octreotide treatment accordance inclusion criterion n°2 . More one line cytotoxic chemotherapy ( patient receive molecule cytotoxic chemotherapy several time therapeutic management consider benefit one single line cytotoxic chemotherapy ) Prior external beam radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow Urinary incontinence History prior malignancy , except cure nonmelanoma skin cancer , cure situ cervical carcinoma , treated malignancy evidence disease least five year . Severe renal ( measure GFR accord MDRD &lt; 50ml/mn nephrotic syndrome ) hepatic insufficiency ( ALT / AST &gt; 2.5 x ULN ALT/AST &gt; 5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy and/or total serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN ) Serum albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL unless prothrombin time within normal range . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define fast blood glucose 2 ULN Decompensated heart failure ( ejection fraction &lt; 45 % ) , myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism revascularization procedure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant bradycardia last 12 month . Hypertension control despite medication ( &gt; =160/95 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) Abnormal cardiac function 12 lead ECG . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTC grade 2 , atrial fibrillation grade , prolongation QTc interval &gt; 470 msec male &gt; 480 msec female . Brain metastasis ( unless metastasis treat stabilize least 24 week , prior enrolment study . Patients history brain metastasis must head CTscan contrast MRI document stable disease prior enrolment study . ) Pregnancy breast feeding ( see appendix 6 ) Previous treatment drug study . Prior systemic treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor antiVEGF angiogenic inhibitor . Current treatment another investigational drug . Treatment potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer within 7 12 day , respectively prior study drug administration . Concomitant treatment therapeutic dos anticoagulant . Low dose warfarin ( Coumadin ) 2 mg PO daily deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis allow well heparinbased anticoagulation Prior treatment chemotherapy immunotherapy somatostatine analog therapy drug ( except case function syndrome somatostatine analogue therapy ) thoracic radiotherapy within 4 week prior start treatment Major surgery cause local radiotherapy within one month prior start treatment Liver embolisation therapy within last 3 month prior start treatment except progression demonstrate embolised lesion use target Unrecovered toxicity kind therapy Active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled disease would impart , judgment investigator , excess risk associate study participation study drug administration , , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study</criteria>
