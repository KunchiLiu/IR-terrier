	<brief_summary>Several animal human epidemiologic study provide evidence exercise may neuroprotective Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Exercise may forestall diagnosis , case already diagnose PD , may slow observed neurodegeneration . Unfortunately , line research early stage , little evidence indicate biological mechanism underlie neuroprotection confer exercise . Toward end , possible interaction endogenous antioxidant enzyme , inflammatory process , reactive oxygen specie may associate exercise improvement PD . One common reason premature death PD fall . Several meta-analyses conclude exercise training program focus balance and/or strength train effective improving aspect balance . Taken together , current body evidence suggest exercise may neuroprotective balance/strength training may decrease likelihood fall . The combination efficacious treatment modality ( exercise balance/strength training ) comprehensive treatment approach improve PD symptom balance previously report relatively mild moderate exercise intensity . Because recent research suggest patient PD may benefit physically intense program , propose aggressive approach regard exercise intensity frequency present trial . The primary purpose study determine feasibility safety high intensity exercise approach PD . A secondary purpose determine trajectory change outcomes duration trial high intensity fall prevention program . It hop signal efficacy allow trial progress comparative effectiveness trial . An important innovative design element collect biological assay well understand mechanism underlie anticipated clinical improvement . Aim 1 test feasibility high-intensity exercise fall prevention boot camp ( HIBC ) patient PD analyze adherence whether achieve minimum Centers Disease Control exercise standard ( 150 min/wk moderate level aerobic exercise ; strengthen least two time per week ) duration trial . Aim 2 determine participation 8-week HIBC direction physical therapist safe individual PD . Secondary Aim 3 determine participation 8-week HIBC produce signal efficacy several physical outcome : fall per physical activity ratio , balance efficacy , motor activity , fatigue , muscle strength , bone health , cognition/mood , quality life . Secondary Aim 4 determine participation 8-week HIBC produce signal efficacy biological outcome , anti-inflammatory cytokine anti-oxidant enzyme . An additional exploratory aim analysis BDNF val66val , val66met , met66met polymorphisms determine differential response exercise . This trial innovative utilizes high intensity comprehensive exercise treatment approach ( aerobic exercise , strengthen , balance training ) . To knowledge , trial individual PD participate trial intensity group `` boot camp '' setting . Another innovative design element use three novel assessment : biological assay pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine , endogenous anti-oxidant enzyme novel assessment fall ( fall per physical activity ratio ) . Participants randomly assign either 8-week HIBC group 8-week usual care control group ( standard , low intensity group therapy class ) direction physical therapist . Each group 15 participant 1:5 patient-to-therapist ratio . The HIBC 1.5 hour daily , Monday Friday . Participants require attend 3 5 day . The protocol HIBC include follow exercise component : A . 30 minute moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise ; B . 15 minute strengthen major muscle group ; C. 15 minute balance training ; , D. 15 minute interspersed rest stretch . Participants rotate four exercise component . Participants one baseline test assessment 2-week , 4 week , 8-week , 6-month point . Outcomes primary aim ( Aim 1 Aim 2 ) frequency count participation , adverse event , compliance exercise . The outcome secondary aim include measure balance fall , physical capacity , fatigue , exercise/physical activity behavior , biological assay .</brief_summary>
