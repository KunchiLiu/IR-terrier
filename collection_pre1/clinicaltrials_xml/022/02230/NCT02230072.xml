	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate maternal fetal outcomes new technique fetoscopic repair fetal MMC Texas Children 's Hospital Pavilion Women . The investigator hypothesis minimally invasive technique feasible , approach efficacy open fetal surgery MMC , significantly less maternal-fetal risk . Both mother baby benefit surgery . The fetus repair MMC defect , mother uterine incision ( hysterotomy ) . A hysterotomy increase risk uterine rupture require subsequent delivery cesarean section . There may also decrease risk Pre-term Premature Rupture Of Membranes ( PPROM ) prematurity compare current open operation . Finally , vaginal delivery possible follow fetoscopic fetal surgery baby show skin cover repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spina bifida devastate neurological congenital anomaly . It result incomplete closure neural tube 22 28 embryological day . Its incidence approximately 1-2 per 1,000 birth . It consider common congenital anomaly central nervous system compatible life . 1 . The frequent form myelomeningocele ( MMC ) , characterize extrusion spinal cord sac fill cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , associate low limb paralysis bowel bladder dysfunction . 2 . The majority MMCs diagnose 14 20 week gestation . MMC associate Chiari II malformation , include constellation anomaly hindbrain herniation , brainstem abnormality , low-lying venous sinus small posterior fossa.The Chiari II malformation deleterious effect motor , cranial nerve cognitive function . Postnatally MMC patient develop hydrocephalus require ventriculoperitoneal shunt . Shunts require lifelong monitoring high failure rate due infection , obstruction , fracture . Experimental study use animal model show prenatal coverage spina bifida-like lesion preserve neurological function reduce reverse hindbrain herniation.These study suggest `` two-hit '' hypothesis ultimate neurologic deficit result combination failure normal neural-tube closure ( first hit ) secondary spinal cord injury result prolonged exposure sensitive neural element amniotic fluid ( second hit mechanism ) . Based hypothesis , open fetal surgical repair MMC propose , recent publication NICHD sponsor randomize control trial demonstrate clear neonatal benefit open in-utero fetal surgical repair MMC . The study show reduction incidence hydrocephalus radiographic severity hindbrain herniation ( relative risk : 0.67 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.56-0.81 ) . Open in-utero fetal surgery without risk NICHD study ( MOMS Trial ) show elevation maternal-fetal morbidity/risk compare postnatally treat group , include high risk chorioamniotic separation ( 26 % vs. 0 % , respectively ) , maternal pulmonary edema ( 6 % vs. 0 % ) , oligohydramnios ( 21 % vs. 0 % ) , placental abruption ( 6 % vs. 0 % ) , spontaneous membrane rupture ( 46 % ; RR : 6.15 ; 95 % CI : 2.75-13.78 ) , spontaneous labor ( 38 % ; RR : 2.80 , 95 % CI : 1.51-5.18 ) , maternal blood transfusion ( 9 % ; RR : 7.18 ; 95 % CI : 0.90-57.01 ) , preterm delivery 34 week ( 46 % ; RR : 9.2 ; 95 % CI : 3.81-22.19 ) . The reason increase incidence complication related nature open fetal procedure , involve multi-faceted invasive approach include maternal laparotomy , large hysterotomy uterine edge stapling , open fetal repair spina bifida defect may involve manipulation exposure fetus significant amount time . Fetal endoscopic surgery progress rapidly past decade investigator able perform number intricate procedure inside uterus specially design instrument . These procedure include laser therapy Twin-twin-transfusion syndrome , fetal cystoscopy fulguration posterior urethral valve , release amniotic band , placement various shunt balloon inside fetal structure cavity ( peritoneal , pleural , cardiac , trachea ) . Fetoscopy offer less invasive therapeutic option could reduce number morbidity ( maternal fetal ) relate open fetal procedure . A animal study clinical human experience fetoscopic repair MMC report show feasibility cover defect patch sealant , even perform full repair . These repair accomplish use least two ( sometimes ) entry port uterine wall . 19,22 Kohl et al . 21,23 Germany , demonstrate feasibility perform complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair MMC use carbon dioxide distend uterus provide dry work area surgeon perform repair . These investigator describe two-layer covering technique use absorbable patch ( Durasis , Cook , Germany ) suture . However , show procedure feasible , percutaneous technique complete two layer surgical closure defect use suture associate prolonged operative time significant maternal obstetrical morbidity . Fetoscopy CO2 gas fill uterus recently report group Bonn , Germany ( Kohl et al ) Sao Paulo , Brazil ( Pedreira et al ) . The fetoscopic technique investigator use develop tested fetal sheep model MMC investigator group others ( Peiro et al ) . This fetoscopy technique employ u human fetal surgery case Houston , Texas Shiraz , Iran show feasibility applicability human uterus fetus , demonstrate improve degree flexibility term access fetus regardless placental location . The technique design decrease maternal risk open uterus fetal surgery maintain similar level fetal benefit see MOMS trial . The investigator technique employ open abdomen/exteriorized ( close ) uterus methodology allow minimally invasive closure fetal neural tube use closed skin repair currently employ Baylor College Medicine/Texas Children 's Fetal Center use open uterus approach . The technique employ novel approach low pressure uterine distention use carbon dioxide gas 8-12 mmHg others attempt fetoscopic repair use , employ much low gas flow rate pressure . In addition , technique allow significantly quick neural tube repair improve access fetus , ability manipulate fetus require position , superior port placement result exteriorized maternal uterus . In addition , exteriorize uterus superior placement allows , require two access port suture uterus allow closed seal minimize gas leakage . Finally , recent advance miniature surgical instrument ( Storz 1.5 - 3mm surgical set ) allow unprecedented flexibility enable full surgical repair perform via fetoscopic approach . We able perform , sheep model , dual access port fetoscopic neural tube closure use 12 F cannula , second 9F cannula , cover patch , medical sealant similar result see open fetal surgical repair sheep model.26 Using knowledge expertise gain 3 year experience fetoscopic sheep surgery , Dr. Peiro perform 8 minimally invasive repair human patient Barcelona ( Vall D'Hebron Hospital , INPER , Mexico City , Mexico ) member team attendance , ( Belfort Shamshirsaz ) perform one fetoscopic evaluation fetus use uterine exposure CO2 technique subsequently convert open case size complexity neural tube defect , Iran . While actual neurosurgical repair propose protocol different ( simple short duration ) do Barcelona Mexico Dr. Peiro , exteriorization uterus preparation fetoscopic repair surgery . In protocol , repair open neural tube defect follow principle already use open repair currently do institution . This involve release placode , dissection surround skin attempt primary closure defect use available skin . In case able complete procedure full skin closure defect , difference open uterus procedure fetoscopic procedure , surgery do fetoscopically rather open uterine incision . If unable close skin primarily despite best fetoscopic effort , option performing/completing repair open procedure exist offer patient . The patient monitor hospital ready discharge . Approximately 6 week surgery post-procedure fetal MRI perform . If evidence good closure neural tube defect reversal Chiari II malformation , vaginal delivery attempt base obstetric criterion . Patients follow person every 3-4 month birth 12 month Spina Bifida Clinic TCH . Remaining visit yearly 5 year . If possible questionnaire mail child 's parent record request treat neurosurgeon schedule .</detailed_description>
