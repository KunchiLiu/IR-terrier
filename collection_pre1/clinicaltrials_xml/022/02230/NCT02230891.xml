	<brief_summary>Despite advance cardiovascular care , occurrence heart failure ( HF ) steadily increase . The increase HF rate pose enormous challenge , individual becomes symptomatic require hospitalization HF , prognosis remain poor . Therefore , prevention HF essential . HF prevention critical issue HF risk factor include common medical condition hypertension diabetes also increase . However , everyone risk factor develop HF . Using novel blood test , investigator propose identify treat subject higher HF risk see investigator stabilize improve ultrasound measure know associate HF risk . This study enroll Veterans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently investigator show HF risk prediction improve use cardiac troponin T measure novel high-sensitivity assay ( hs-cTnT ) N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) . Furthermore , hs-cTnT seem identify individual high risk among establish risk factor ( hypertension ) HF . In preliminary result , investigator show individual systolic blood pressure 120-129 mm Hg elevate hs-cTnT high rate incident HF systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg undetectable hs-cTnT . Therefore , investigator believe use hs-cTnT estimate HF risk investigator identify individual aggressive modification risk factor high blood pressure associate favorable risk-benefit ratio . The investigator ' objective/specific aim therefore evaluate treatment select subject Stage A B HF ( i.e. , hs-cTnT &gt; 5 ng/L estimate 10-year HF hospitalization risk &gt; 5 % ) reasonably well-controlled blood pressure antihypertensive agent ( carvedilol spironolactone ) associate improvement surrogate marker associate incident HF ( i.e. , speckle-tracked cardiac vascular strain ) . Carvedilol spironolactone chosen follow reason : ) routinely use first-line antihypertensive agent ; b ) beta-blockade associate decrease hs-cTnT preliminary analysis subject establish HF ; c ) mechanism action carvedilol spironolactone provide sound scientific rationale use prevention HF . Using prospective open-label blind end point ( PROBE ) design , investigator propose randomize 210 subject age &gt; 40 year systolic blood pressure 125-150 mm Hg , cardiac troponin T ( measure novel high-sensitivity assay ) level &gt; 5 ng/L , 10-year HF risk &gt; 5 % ( estimate use validated laboratory model include demographic factor , NT-proBNP , hs-cTnT ) receive carvedilol ( nonselective beta-blocker ) , spironolactone ( aldosterone antagonist ) , usual care 18 month . The primary end point change global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimate use 2D speckle track . Additionally , change vascular strain biomarkers evaluate . This study help u identify whether either medication test large randomized clinical trial prevent incidence HF .</detailed_description>
