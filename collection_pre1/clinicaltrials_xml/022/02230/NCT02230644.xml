	<detailed_description>Stress measure via number method , include psychological physiological . This study propose examine three signature stress order triangulate data achieve comprehensive understanding patient ' stress response : 1 . Psychological - use validate psychological questionnaire include STAI measure trait state anxiety . We also use simple prospective time perception test Stroop test ass whether patient ' attention capacity . 2 . Physiological - We use biosensors bioharnesses gather electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data order test complexity loss hypothesis . This hypothesis state physiological response organisms constraint ( age , illness , stress ) exhibit grossly reduce dynamic lose ability adopt change environment . We examine whether patient exhibit reduced dynamic operation approach whether art use increase complexity response . 3 . Biological - take two small saliva ( spit ) sample patient test whether level stress hormone cortisol elevate patient , whether immune biomarkers pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha IL-1 reduce pre-surgical stress maintain music art present . Previous research within field psychoneuroimmunology suggest alteration psychological stress level consequence biological response ( Ader , 2007 ) .</detailed_description>
