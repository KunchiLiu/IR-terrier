	<brief_title>Patient Satisfaction After Facial Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study assess patient satisfaction reconstruction Mohs skin cancer resection defect face , resection defect either see unseen patient . In way , investigator determine effect visualization pre-operative defect patient satisfaction facial reconstruction . Any effect patient satisfaction identify tracked time . Hypothesis : The null hypothesis study patient satisfaction reconstruction Mohs defect face unaffected opportunity visualize defect prior reconstruction , observation persists time . Furthermore , patient able recall size cancer resection defect accurately detailed description see defect mirror . Justification : This study address whether visualization defect prior reconstruction affect patient satisfaction . Visualization defect prior reconstruction standardize occasionally , mean necessarily , portion consent reconstruction procedure . For excision reconstruction procedure study , patient receive gold standard treatment skin cancer . This include Mohs excision cancer subsequent reconstruction excision defect use either primary closure local flap . Alternative treatment approach include various form excision reconstruction cancer free margin immediately determine . Objectives : The objective study determine whether visualization cancer excision defect face , prior reconstruction , improve post-reconstruction patient satisfaction . The satisfaction measure seek primarily satisfaction cosmetic result also include measure pertain symptomatic scarring , skin relate quality life ability recall defect size also collect . Research Method : Patients meet research criterion recruit study . These patient undergo cancer excision reconstruction skin cancer defect clinic visit . After cancer excision complete , randomize either view not-viewing skin cancer excision defect prior reconstruction . After reconstruction provide series survey ass research question pose study . Surveys distribute clinic day surgery routine follow-up appointment one week two three month . Statistical Analysis : The planned sample size study eighty patient randomize two group forty . Study end point seek patient answer three set survey determine patient satisfaction cosmetic appearance reconstruction , rank ordinal scale , primary end-point . Secondary end point use ordinal binary measure also seek include skin relate quality life ( measure Skindex 16 ) , scar , ability accurately recall size skin cancer excision defect . A chi-squared analysis data perform .</detailed_description>
