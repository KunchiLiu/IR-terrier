	<brief_title>A Study IDN-6556 Cirrhotic Subjects With Portal Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies patient liver disease demonstrate cCK18 elevate serum patient associated disease severity . Studies also show cCK18 generally elevate high degree cirrhosis liver disease . In addition , increase stage cirrhosis Child-Pugh A , Child-Pugh B Child-Pugh C associate progressively high level caspase cleave cytokeratin 18 . This suggest apoptosis caspase activity associate severity disease . IDN-6556 ability inhibit inflammation apoptosis may beneficial impact dynamic structural component associate pathogenesis portal hypertension cirrhosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject minimum adult legal age ( accord local law sign informed consent document ) , able provide write informed consent , able understand willing comply requirement study Clinical , radiological , biochemical evidence liver cirrhosis Evidence portal hypertension evidence follow : 1 . Splenomegaly , image and/or clinical evaluation , platelet count &lt; 120,000 study entry , 2 . Presence small sized varix screen endoscopy and/or collateral circulation imaging , 3 . Presence medium/large varix never bleed obliterated endoscopic ligation Portal hypertension define hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) &gt; 5 mmHg Screening Willingness utilize two reliable form contraception ( male females childbearing potential ) Screening one month last dose study drug . Decompensated cirrhosis define presence overt ascites ( require diuretic ) , overt encephalopathy ( require specific therapy ) , history variceal hemorrhage . Known infection HIV Hepatic failure define total bilirubin ≥12 mg/dL Other nonliver organ failure , include : 1 . Renal failure define creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL 2 . Cerebral failure define hepatic encephalopathy grade III IV 3 . Coagulation failure define INR ≥ 2.5 platelet ≤ 20x109/L 4 . Hemodynamic requirement inotropic support ChildPugh score 1015 ( ChildPugh C classification ) Use vasoactive drug ( within 3 month Screening ) may impair hepatic blood flow ; example include limited : 1. βblockers , include carvedilol 2 . Nitrates 3 . Vasopressin ( analogue ) 4 .
