	<brief_summary>This study investigate wether patient increase trigeminal perception threshold low expression TRP channel often nasal blockage despite functionally successful nasal surgery ( TRP channel = transient receptor potential channel ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trigeminal Endonasal Perception : A Predictor Septoplasty Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study find wether patient high trigeminal perception threshold ( =decreased intranasal sensibility ) low expression TRP channel mucosa suffer often impaired nasal breathing surgery . This could lead identification prognostic factor therefore prevention nasal surgery bad outcome . Further , differences patient empty nose syndrome asymptomatic patient extend intranasal surgery , concern trigeminal perception TRP channel expression investigate .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergo primary septoplasty and/or turbinoplasty Patients suffer empty nose syndrome measurably successful nasal surgery Patients remove turbinate and/or septum , suffer ENS ( i.e . tumor patient ) Patients know neurologic disorder could compromise perception threshold measurement Patients know allergies/intolerance test agent use measure perception threshold ( Cineol=Eucalypt ; Menthol , CO2= Carbon Dioxide ) Inability judge understand test informed consent</criteria>
