	<brief_summary>This protocol describe single site mechanistic study investigate microRNAs ( miRNAs ) differentially express airway epithelium patient asthma baseline response allergen challenge . We hypothesize allergen exposure enhance airway smooth muscle contractility epithelial cell mRNA/miRNA production consequence locally increase T-cell derived cytokine production . The study involve three visit course approximately 14 day . At Visit 1 , participant characterize detail lung function testing , methacholine challenge testing , allergen skin prick test . At Visit 2 , participant undergo bronchoscopy segmental allergen administration either cat dust mite standardize allergen extract . At Visit 3 ( either 24 hour later 7 day later ) , bronchoscopy perform collect airway sample include bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , epithelial brushing endobronchial biopsy . Sample analysis include measurement miRNA mRNA expression epithelial brushing ( RNAseq qPCR ) ; analysis cell surface marker BAL cell blood cell ; collection endobronchial biopsy immunostaining immune cell localization , immunoblotting smooth cell protein phosphorylation , analysis mucin content smooth muscle cell subculture . A total 38 subject ( 26 asthmatic stable well-controlled asthma , 6 allergic non-asthmatics 6 non-allergic non-asthmatics ) complete study .</brief_summary>
