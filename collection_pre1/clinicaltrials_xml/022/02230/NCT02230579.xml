	<brief_title>Phase I Study Ascending Doses MMV390048 Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single centre , double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled , ascend dose study healthy male female volunteer ( non-childbearing potential ) age 18 55 year . The study divide two part . The first part comprise seven fasted cohort ( 8 10 volunteer ) receive single , ascend dose ( SAD ) MMV390048 ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic profile . The start dose administer first cohort 5 mg. An additional cohort ( cohort 8 , re-using volunteer one previous cohort ) receive single dose MMV390048 feed state evaluate effect food pharmacokinetics tolerability compound . The data obtain cohort SAD part study undergo formal review Safety Review Team ( SRT ) . Should safety profile compound deem acceptable , pharmacokinetic parameter indicate acceptable level drug elicit pharmacodynamic response achieve human plasma , study proceed second part . During second part study volunteer receive multiple , ascend dos ( MAD ) MMV390048 ass pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability follow multiple oral dos . Up three cohort eight volunteer enrol part study . Each volunteer receive three consecutive daily dos MMV390048 .</detailed_description>
