	<brief_summary>Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) detect human Caribbean area first time November 2013 ( St-Martin Island ) . By February 2014 , virus spread several Caribbean island well French Guyana , South America . During outbreak Chikungunya affect Reunion island 2005/2006 , observe neonatal form infection acquire mother child transmission childbirth , exception critical . Mother-to-child transmission occur mother viremic time delivery . The mean duration viremia onset first clinical symptom six day . The rate mother-to-child transmission 50 % . All neonate contaminate labor delivery present symptomatic disease rate severe form 50 % , primarily due damage central nervous system , often leave permanent damage ( seizure , cerebral palsy ) .Due severity Chikungunya neonates burden cerebral palsy , imperative identify safe effective preventive and/or curative intervention . Human polyvalent immunoglobulin purify plasma sample obtain Chikungunya-convalescent donor exhibit potent neutralizing activity vitro . They evaluate preventive curative effect neonatal mouse model CHIKV infection . After administration lethal dose CHIKV , neonatal mouse receive immunoglobulin survive control animal receive non hyperimmune immunoglobulin die . In human , specific human immunoglobulin prove effective safe neonate bear hepatitis B viremic mother . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize administration anti-CHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous immunoglobulin neonate expose high risk severe form Chikungunya infection safe enough justify evaluation open non randomize trial aim confirm safety preliminary ass efficacy intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The population study consist neonate bear mother present clinical symptom Chikungunya within six day two day childbirth . These neonate therefore expose high risk develop severe form Chikungunya infection . In case reality risk demonstrate positive CHIKV RT-PCR maternal blood sample childbirth . References literature data relevant trial , provide background trial . Chikungunya virus detect human Caribbean area first time November 2013 ( St-Martin Island ) . By February 2014 , virus spread several Caribbean island well French Guyana , South America . During outbreak Chikungunya ( CHIK ) affect Reunion Island 2005/2006 , neonatal form infection acquire mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) childbirth , report 50 % viremic mother associate high neonate morbidity . MTCT occur mother viremic time delivery . The viremic period begin 2 day onset symptoms last six day follow first symptom . In infected neonate contaminate labor , symptom appear median incubation period 4 day . All neonate CHIK case symptomatic rate severe form 50 % ; severe form primarily due damage central nervous system , often leave permanent damage ( seizure , cerebral palsy ) . Due severity Chikungunya neonates burden cerebral palsy , imperative identify safe effective preventive and/or curative intervention . We hypothesize administration hyperimmune human intravenous immunoglobulin neonate expose high risk severe form Chikungunya infection safe enough justify evaluation open non randomize trial aim confirm safety preliminary ass effectiveness intervention . Although primary objective trial ass safety hyperimmune human intravenous immunoglobulin neonate , clear potential individual benefit expect participate neonate , namely decrease risk development severe form Chikungunya , especially term high-burden central nervous system complication ( seizure , cerebral palsy ) . This major issue since first case complicate neonatal Chikungunya already occur Martinique January 2014 ( clinical manifestation include fever , pain , skin rash , encephalopathy four-day-old neonate ) . If trial demonstrate safety consistent potential efficacy anti-CHIKV hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin , would pave way realization phase III trial whose main objective would confirm effectiveness strategy , include situation , particularly individual risk severe disease expose neonate adult underlying condition . This would also proof-of-concept therapeutic/preventive strategy severe emerge infectious disease arboviral disease viral hemorrhagic fever , long specific drug vaccine available . The risk develop severe form Chikungunya high neonate bear CHIKV-viremic mother . Central nervous system complication represent important concern frequent frequently associate permanent brain damage . To date , effective therapeutic strategy identify situation . The administration hyperimmune anti-CHICKV intravenous immunoglobulin proven effective preventing development Chikungunya neonatal mouse model . Several randomized clinical trial demonstrate intravenous immunoglobulin safe administer neonate infant . The first case neonatal Chikungunya infection identify French West Indies since onset current outbreak least one case associate CNS complication . Pediatricians neonatologists work four hospital participate clinical trial contact . They express keen provide potentially effective therapy newborn expose high risk develop Chikungunya infection convince treatment would harmless neonate , base experience use polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulin . No specific treatment identified date Chikungunya infection , especially severe neonatal form . While efficacy safety anti-CHIKV hyperimmune immunoglobulin demonstrate neonate mouse , date study perform human . Therefore study would first assess promise therapeutic intervention . It also expect study provide new information natural history Chikungunya infection neonate well pathophysiology viral transmission ( transplacentally labor or/and fetal progression genital tract ) . Actually comparison quantitative CHIKV RT PCR titers mother 's urine delivery , placenta , neonate 's blood fluid , well determination placental microperfusion marker ( placental alkaline phosphatase cord blood ) shed light issue . Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint evaluate enrolled neonate . Tolerability safety anti-CHIK IVIG assess evaluate frequency patent ductus arteriosus , necrotizing enterocolitis , pulmonary hemorrhage , tachycardia hypotension anti-CHIKV IVIG infusion , hemolytic anemia , hyponatremia ascites . Secondary endpoint : Secondary endpoint evaluate neonate born mother definite CHIKV-infection . Primary objective : The primary objective trial evaluate tolerability safety anti-CHIKV hyperimmune immunoglobulin give intravenously neonate expose high risk MTCT CHIKV , i.e . bear mother definite possible CHIKV infection time delivery . Secondary objective : The secondary objective trial evaluate efficacy anti-CHIKV hyperimmune immunoglobulin give intravenously subgroup neonate bear mother definite CHIKV infection . Neonates classify one follow 3 category : - Neonatal CHIKV clinical disease : - Clinical symptom consistent acute CHIKV infection - Demonstration infection base CHIKV IgM seroconversion and/or identification CHIKV viremia ( positive CHIKV qRT-PCR Day 3 ) , - Neonatal CHIKV asymptomatic infection : - Absence symptom consistent CHIV infection - Demonstration infection base CHIKV IgM seroconversion and/or identification CHIKV viremia ( positive CHIKV qRT-PCR Day 3 ) , - Neonatal CHIKV infection exclude : - Absence CHIKV IgM seroconversion Social Behavioral Science Survey : In parallel , conduct Social Behavioral Science survey aim assess factor associate parental decision participate clinical trial , give peculiar context ( emerge disease , therapeutic intervention neonate , invitation participate peri-partum period , short period time decision-making .</detailed_description>
