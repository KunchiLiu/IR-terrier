	<brief_title>Endothelial Microparticles : A Novel Marker Vascular Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis proposal chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) treatment calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs ) associate release endothelial microparticles plasma . These injury-associated microparticles different molecular/protein composition release endothelial cell healthy patient , abundance correlate vascular injury . To test hypothesis investigator propose 3 arm case-controlled study include normal control , individual stage III IV CKD receive CNI therapy , individual stage III IV CKD post kidney transplantation receive CNI . The goal study measure amount microparticles patient kidney disease kidney transplant . Another goal study see measurement microparticles related poor function vessel ( endothelial dysfunction ) .</detailed_description>
