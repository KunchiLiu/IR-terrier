	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure effect reduced-calorie low energy density diet without increased cognitive dietary restraint ( CDR ) stress ( biological marker perceive stress ) , eat behaviour , appetite sensation , anthropometric variable woman 's attitude toward child 's eating behaviour premenopausal overweight/obese woman short term ( immediately end 4-week intervention ) long term ( 3 month end intervention ) . The investigator hypothesize cortisol concentration higher , appetite sensation increase ( i.e . increase global appetite score ) food craving prevalent woman energy-restriction-plus-CDR group woman energy-restriction-without-CDR group 4-week intervention . They also hypothesize perceived stress high food craving prevalent woman energy-restriction-plus-CDR group woman energy-restriction-without-CDR group 3-month post intervention . They hypothesize significant difference body weight change observe two group maternal restriction child 's eat high energy-restriction-plus-CDR group energy-restriction-without-CDR group 4-week intervention 3-month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It clear large proportion individual regain weight follow dietary weight loss intervention likely homeostatic non-homeostatic factor favour return initial energy status . However , study perform date document effect context intervention favour energy restriction CDR . Thus , difference state energy restriction alone state energy restriction combine CDR factor regulate energy balance know . In order study important question appropriately , need create condition energy restriction without increase CDR , achieve satiate diet ( i.e . well-balanced low energy density diet ) . This easy create context control intervention food drink provide . We propose create , control context , energy restriction subject blind i.e . consume less energy energy need without know restrain . Such design permit document first time independent effect CDR context reduce calorie diet factor associate regulation energy balance . The propose study also allow explore impact increase CDR woman 's attitude toward child 's eating behaviour . Taken together , result arise propose study well position relevance develop weight loss approach focus CDR favour healthy weight management woman family . Data collect 4-week intervention , well 3 month end intervention . In order appropriately test hypothesis , state real purpose study inform consent form woman tell study impact diet blood pressure . However , end study , woman debrief sign second informed consent form true purpose study explain .</detailed_description>
