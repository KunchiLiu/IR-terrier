	<brief_summary>Side effect common treatment radiotherapy tumours pelvis affect way bowel urinary system work well cause sexual difficulty , skin damage bone problem . Problems bowel , bladder , sexual organ skin mostly result thicken tissue response radiotherapy , process call `` fibrosis '' . Fibrosis often worsen time . There progress treat bowel symptom usually worst problem radiotherapy . However , even receive best possible treatment , many patient well , often cure difficult problem . For year , hypothesise fibrosis could treat symptom would improve . Recent research laboratory animal suggest effective treatment radiation-induced fibrosis combination therapy drug call Pentoxifylline together nutritional supplement contain gamma-tocotrienol ( Tocovid SupraBio ) , substance derive palm oil . Both agent simple take side effect rare . This study recruit volunteer continue difficult side effect previous radiotherapy pelvis despite receive best treatment available unique clinic The Royal Marsden pioneer treatment bowel problem radiotherapy . Two every three volunteer take part , randomly assign treatment Pentoxifylline Tocovid SupraBio , one three receive dummy pill . Neither patient staff assess know treatment give . Volunteers take active treatment dummy tablet year assess regularly treatment year afterwards . This study show whether active treatment effective dummy pill improve symptom cause radiation-induced fibrosis .</brief_summary>
