	<brief_summary>Beta-2-agonists effective reduce airway narrow asthma protect stimuli produce bronchoconstriction . The combination long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) become commonly used asthma controller medication class United States , unfortunately , even LABAs add ICS use regularly , 58-81 % patient asthma fail achieve total control . Regular use beta-agonists , short long-acting , reduce ability agent protect airway narrowing occurs asthma response bronchoconstrictor stimulus . We refer reduced effect loss bronchoprotection . In proof concept trial aim determine alendronate , diminish beta-2 adrenergic receptor internalization , reduce loss bronchoprotection occur regular use LABAs , even use combination ICS .</brief_summary>
