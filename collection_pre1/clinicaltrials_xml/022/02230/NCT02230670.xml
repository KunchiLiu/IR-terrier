	<brief_title>A Study IDN-6556 Subjects With Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study show caspase cleave cytokeratin 18 ( cCK18 ) elevate serum liver disease patient associated disease severity , thus associate excessive apoptosis caspase activity disease . Studies also show caspase cleave cytokeratin 18 generally elevate even great degree cirrhosis liver disease . In addition , increase stage cirrhosis Child-Pugh A , Child-Pugh B Child-Pugh C associate progressively high level caspase cleave cytokeratin 18 . Therefore , appear apoptosis caspase activity tend correlate stage cirrhosis . A caspase inhibitor like IDN-6556 could clinical utility reduce rate apoptosis cirrhotic patient potentially reduce progression disease determine clinical marker progression .</detailed_description>
