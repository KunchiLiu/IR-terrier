	<brief_summary>Lytic bone disease continue one devastating complication multiple myeloma ( MM ) despite recent dramatic advancement MM management , bone lesion persist continue significantly impact patient 's morbidity , even individual 's myeloma otherwise good control . To date , agent show prolonged bone anabolic response myeloma . Preliminary study treat healthy postmenopausal woman single dose sotatercept demonstrate rapid sustained increase serum biochemical marker bone formation decrease marker bone resorption . Similarly , murine analog sotatercept , RAP-011 , increase bone mineral density strength murine study normal animal model bone loss . We hypothesize sotatercept provide anabolic response bone myeloma patient bone disease .</brief_summary>
