	<brief_summary>The investigator evaluate effect novel drug improve nicotinergic receptor function vs. placebo short-term smoking abstinence smoker schizophrenia high interest quitting . The investigator predict novel drug increase day abstinence , compare placebo , identify potential evidence efficacy smoke cessation smoker schizophrenia . The investigator also assess new drug decrease nicotine withdrawal , crave , cognitive impairment early abstinence , well evaluate adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Smoking Cessation Drug Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : This Proof Concept study plan nearly 2 year determine potential efficacy novel drug smoker schizophrenia . This study assess 60 smoker diagnosis either schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder high quit interest ability quit week-long attempt abstain receive novel drug vs. placebo , use within-subjects cross-over design . Research Plan : Active drug placebo provide participant double-blind fashion . Study participation last 6 week subject enter study follow screen physical exam session ( 8 week total ) . Participants engage two identical study phase , involve visit 3 week vary whether active drug placebo administer . The 3 week involve : baseline visit , dose run-up ( week 2 ) , week 3 ( abstinence assessment ) . The first week period baseline week smoke normally without medication . During week 2 , subject begin dose run-up active drug placebo , increase 4 day 1 tablet 50 mg daily 100 mg b.i.d . ( two 50 mg tablet twice/day ) , continue second third week . Active drug placebo administer counter-balanced order cross-over design . During week 3 , subject instruct try abstain day , i.e . Mon-Friday . Most visit last 60 min involve psychiatric assessment ( include psychopathology neurological side effect ) rating , provide expired breath carbon monoxide ( CO ) measure assess smoking exposure past 24 hr , well complete brief self-report measure crave , withdrawal , mood . On week 3 phase , one visit involve cognitive testing . On Fri week 3 , subject discontinue medication resume ad lib smoke prior next study period , involve 3-week procedure ( medication condition ) : baseline , dose run-up , full dose administration plus abstinence assessment . Note active medication take one period , placebo take period . Pill count use measure adherence . Primary secondary dependent measure describe separately report . Psychopathology assess use standard rating scale evaluate psychosis general psychopathology severity illness rating , suicide rating scale . These clinical impression patient study assist monitoring stability worsen psychosis suicidal behavior and/or need exit patient study . Laboratory EKG monitoring begin end study also part subject safety procedure . Patients offer choice one FDA approve smoke cessation agent , i.e . nicotine replacement therapy , bupropion varenicline 3-month period upon completion study . If patient decline open-label smoking cessation participation , request come one post-study visit , 14 ± 4 day later . At first post-study visit , adverse event , participation end . Methods : The novel drug placebo administer double-blind counter-balanced order cross-over design . This clinical trial ass long term smoke cessation within-subjects comparison short-term effect drug abstinence abstinence symptom week-long period , relative placebo . Significance : This study address important question whether novel drug show potential efficacy smoke cessation , relative placebo , smoker schizophrenia . This procedure could enormous implication accelerate development medication similar compound help people quit smoke increase efficiency early medication evaluation .</detailed_description>

Potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor review exclusion , see . In view novel drug moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor , subject receive follow narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates exclude : Alfentanil , astemizole , cisapride , cyclosporine , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , fentanyl , pimozide , quinidine , sirolimus , tacrolimus , terfenadine . In view impact clozapine smoking cessation , patient receive clozapine exclude . Stable medical condition example : hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia etc treat ongoing patient receive exclusionary drug note consider inclusion case case basis .</criteria>
