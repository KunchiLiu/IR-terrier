	<brief_summary>Many individual experience acute change think reason skill surgery . This call post-operative delirium ( PD ) . PD symptom typically start 1-3 day surgery . Advanced age identify risk factor PD . The purpose study determine perform mental exercise , surgery , help reduce post-surgery memory thinking problem . A total 268 patient recruit study . At least 10 day surgery , subject complete series questionnaire assess baseline cognition level ( think ability ) status overall well-being . At completion screen visit , qualify subject randomize two group : Participants randomize Cognitive Exercise group expect complete tablet-based brain game provide Lumosity . These subject give handheld tablet duration preoperative period . Participants group expect achieve 1 hour mental training day least 10 consecutive day prior surgery . Participants randomize Normal Activity group encourage carry baseline daily activity , study-related cognitive exercise expectation surgery . These subject still complete questionnaire assessment Cognitive Exercise group throughout study , however , ask alter normal daily routine mental exertion ( i.e . watch television , reading , puzzle , etc . ) permit subscribe Lumosity research study . On day surgery , baseline delirium evaluation ( CAM - Confusion Assessment Method ) take surgery . During surgery , research personnel monitor vital sign medication give . After surgery , another CAM evaluation take post-operative recovery room . Throughout subject 's hospital stay , pain level medication usage record . The CAM MDAS ( Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale ) use identify determine severity PD . The evaluation give twice daily , approximately 6:00 AM 6:00 PM , 7 day hospital discharge ( whichever come first ) . The Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale ( PQRS ) use post-operative day 6:00 PM discharge , complete phone POD 7 patient discharge . The PQRS also administer phone POD 30 POD 90 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential study participant identify one two way , either treat physician clinic decision make pursue surgery researcher monitoring OR schedule . When potential participant identify treat physician clinic , ask patient study personnel may call discus study . If patient agrees contact , surgeon alert study personnel call patient explain study arrange initial study ( screen ) visit . Study personnel monitor OR schedule call potential patient surgeon already identify clinic . In case , patient inform phone surgeon grant permission contact regard study . Surgeons make aware patient approach phone , update accordingly patient agrees screen visit subsequently enrol study . All screen visit occur OSU Pre-operative Assessment Center ( OPAC ) . When possible screen visit co-inside pre-operative test per Anesthesia Department OPAC . Informed consent occur initial screening visit take place approximately 2 week prior surgery , less 10 day pre-op . At visit , member research team obtain demographic information ( gender , education level ) , historical medical information , information regard medication usage . The researcher perform Mini-Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) - modify version ( see attach document ) , Self Administered Gerocognitve Form ( SAGE ) - four version ( see attach questionnaire ) , Geriatric Depression Scale , Charlson Comorbidity Index , Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale ( PQRS ) , Short-form 36 Health Related Quality Life Measure . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize either cognitive exercise control group . Patients cognitive exercise group give tablet preinstalled access Lumosity ( Lumos Labs , San Francisco , CA , USA ) , cognitive exercise software application use study . Each participant cognitive exercise group expect complete 1 hour Lumosity brain exercise daily minimum 10 day prior surgery , equal effective 'dose ' least 10 hour . Playing time determine either : ( ) actual in-game playing time ; ( b ) calculate research team Screening Visit ( see `` Subject Diary '' ) . The Lumosity software allow monitor participant compliance researcher . Patients control group carry normal activity prior surgery . All patient undergo surgery plan . On day surgery , prior proceed operate room , patient assess Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) confirm presence delirium pre-operatively . In Post-anesthesia Recovery Unit , different member research team ( blind patient 's group assignment ) repeat CAM ass PD . While hospitalize , pain score determine use Verbal Analog Scale narcotic use obtain electronic medical record least 8 hour frequency ( enter register nurse ) . All participant evaluate blind researcher use combine CAM/Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale ( MDAS ) 7:30AM ± 1.5 hr 6:30PM ± 1.5 hr PD subsequent post-op day discharge . Additionally , PQRS complete 6:30PM ± 1.5 hrs assessment . The PQRS , MMSE , SAGE repeat prior discharge POD 7 . A different form SAGE examination , well alternate number word sequence PQRS MMSE assessment , use order reduce potential influence learn effect . At end visit , active patient participation complete . For subject discharge POD 7 , PQRS give via telephone . Follow-up visit conduct POD 30 POD 90 via telephone . The PQRS obtain POD 30 , PQRS , GDS , SF-36 obtain POD 90 . The research team also periodically check medical record time readmission provider note related medical event . Participation complete POD 90 .</detailed_description>
