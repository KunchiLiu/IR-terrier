Although usually easily treated antibiotic give either orally vein ( intravenously ) , know route antibiotic treatment prescribe person attend Emergency Department cellulitis clear . A Clinical Prediction rule ( CPR ) decision-making tool come original research oppose opinion expert . We intend create preliminary CPR decide patient require oral patient require intravenous antibiotic cellulitis first visit emergency department . The aim provide safer care reduce risk patient return hospital worsen infection . It also promote cost-effective care reduce hospital re-attendance rate waste antibiotic .
