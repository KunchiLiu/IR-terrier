	<brief_title>Regorafenib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Cancer Esophagus Gastroesophageal Junction Who Have Completed Chemoradiation Therapy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient resect esophageal gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction adenocarcinoma treat regorafenib vs. placebo adjuvant setting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare safety profile adjuvant regorafenib vs. placebo patient locally advance resectable esophageal GE junction adenocarcinoma . II . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient resect esophageal GE junction adenocarcinoma treat regorafenib vs. placebo adjuvant setting . III . To compare DFS patient receive least 1 cycle therapy . IV . To collect tumor sample future genomic analysis explore biology locally advance esophageal GE junction adenocarcinoma . V. DFS compare arm time surgery well . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Within 6-12 week surgery , patient receive regorafenib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . ARM II : Within 6-12 week surgery , patient receive placebo PO QD day 1-21 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
