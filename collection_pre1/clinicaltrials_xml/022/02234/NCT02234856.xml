	<brief_title>Evaluation Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Simulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ensuring surgical competence trainee mandatory surgical residency program , yet evaluation graduate resident base observation subjective feedback . We develop computer base video surgical simulator facilitate cognitive knowledge step-by-step process need perform laparoscopic hysterectomy , learn essential pelvic anatomy avoid surgical complication . Studies show trainee already cognitive knowledge perform procedure , focus learn surgical technique minimize surgical complication . Laparoscopy become standard surgical care gynecologic patient . The benefit minimally invasive surgery include reduce postoperative pain , short hospitalization , less scarring , quicker return normal activity , preservation immune response , few long-term problem adhesion incisional hernia . The current challenge surgical education produce competent surgeon skilled perform integrate multiple advance surgical technology . Surgical competency involve proficiency technical skill , decision-making ( preoperative , operative , postoperative ) , team performance require knowledge communication skill . The increase complexity surgery requirement mastery laparotomy , laparoscopy , endoscopy reduces feasibility traditional `` see one , one , teach one '' model surgical education . Lack training consider major barrier perform laparoscopic surgery . Alternative training modality require acquire necessary surgical skill laparoscopy . Although transfer skill knowledge trainee time graduation , current training program design validate , effective , competency-based manner . A successful laparoscopic curriculum incorporate cognitive component addition manual skill component . Although benefit simulator method surgical education validate , comprehensive curriculum development lack . Most recently , Zevin et al . ( 2012 ) conduct Delphi consensus involve international expert surgical education principle design , validation implementation simulation-based surgical training curriculum . The main component final framework include predevelopment analysis ; cognitive , psychomotor , team-based training ; curriculum validation , evaluation , improvement ; maintenance training . They produce framework base broad principle educational theory apply surgical specialty . Several author emphasize importance cognitive teach comprehensive surgical skill train curriculum . Learning begins acquisition procedure-specific knowledge . Categories include pre-procedure assessment preparation ; anatomic knowledge ; safety limitation specific instrument ; ergonomics ; post-procedure management . A cognitive curriculum include read material form text book journal article well procedural video tutorial . The cognitive component study trainee technical skill train follow satisfactory performance paper-based test knowledge mock operative note dictation . Teaching error commonly associate procedure include trainee anticipate avoid future , recognize manage occur . The purpose research study test validity new educational tool enhancement current teach method perform hysterectomy . Should data substantiate hypothesis , cognitive function surgical trainee enhance use trainer , tool able utilized new , advanced , creative tool teach perform hysterectomy . This tool might able utilized advance teach many surgical procedure resident many different surgical program .</detailed_description>
