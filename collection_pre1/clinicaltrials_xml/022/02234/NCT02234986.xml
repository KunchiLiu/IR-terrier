	<brief_title>A Multi-center , Open-label Study Oral ENMD-2076 Treatment Patients With Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : • To determine 6-month progression free survival ( PFS6 ) rate patient advance fibrolamellar carcinoma ( FLC ) treat daily oral ENMD 2076 Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate overall response rate use RECIST v 1.1 criterion patient FLC treat daily oral ENMD 2076 . - To evaluate median Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , Time Progression ( TTP ) , Overall Survival ( OS ) . - To determine safety ENMD-2076 define frequency severity adverse event patient FLC treat daily oral ENMD-2076</detailed_description>
