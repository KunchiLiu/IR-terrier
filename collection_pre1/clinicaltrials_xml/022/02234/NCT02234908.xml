Drug-resistant TB ( DR-TB ) even concern , 15,000 South African patient diagnose multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) 2012 , nearly fifth global total , high mortality among receive standard MDR-TB treatment . Because high risk TB HIV among household contact TB patient importance early case detection disease especially DR-TB , improve TB case find high priority . Recent study show healthcare worker make multiple visit home TB patient order screen household contact logistically challenge resource- intensive strategy , routinely undertaken public sector setting South Africa . One alternative home visit could prove effective affordable offer small economic reward household contact TB patient voluntarily present healthcare facility TB symptom screen optional HIV testing . Economic incentives successful increase demand healthcare variety setting , tried way increase uptake service among patient ' contact , rather among diagnosed patient . This pilot project evaluation feasibility , acceptability , cost offering economic reward , form shopping voucher , household contact index patient ( outpatient drug-susceptible drug-resistant TB patient ) present study clinic TB screen optional HIV testing , provide reward index patient participate , enter index patient whose contact present lottery win prize . The reward R50-R100 ( $ 5- $ 10 ) large enough encourage voluntary presentation clinic , large perceive coercive patient unaffordable health system . The effectiveness intervention screen high proportion contact cost per contact screen TB case diagnose compare exist publish unpublished data study active case-finding home visit status quo passive case find .
