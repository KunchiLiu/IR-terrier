	<criteria>Pathologically cytologically MSKCC confirm esophagogastric adenocarcinoma . Metastatic disease measurable evaluable CT MRI scan accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . Locally recurrent disease amenable potentially curative surgery radiation therapy also allow . Lesions must ≥10mm size . Recurrent metastatic disease within prior radiation field acceptable long disease progress radiation field RECIST criterion . Patients allow maximum 1 prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . Patients allow maximum two prior regimen previously receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy initial localized disease . Patients age 18 year old . Life expectancy least 6 month . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) performance score ≥ 70 % . Patients must able reliably take swallow oral medication . Patients prior deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) currently anticoagulation regimen permit . Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function assess follow : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 . Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 . Total bilirubin within normal limit , 01 mg/dL . AST ALT &lt; 1.5 time ULN . ( For patient liver involvement : AST ALT≤ 2.5 ULN ) . International normalized ratio ( INR ) &lt; 2 , prothrombin time ( PT ) &lt; 20 sec , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 55 sec . Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN GFR &lt; 45 ml/min . HER2 positive esophagogastric cancer . Patients unknown HER2 status permit . Patients receive concurrent anticancer therapy investigational agent intention treat esophagogastric cancer . Last prior therapy must complete least 2 week ( 14 day ) prior start Nintedanib . Concurrent radiotherapy permit disease progression treatment protocol . However , symptomatic treatment preexist nontarget lesion would allow approval principal investigator . Prior treatment VEGFR inhibitor . Brain metastases leptomeningeal disease . History arterial thromboembolic ( arterial blood clot ) hemorrhagic event exception patient pulmonary embolism stable anticoagulation regimen . Patients cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past six month . Patients warfarin reason . Patient known preexist interstitial lung disease . History presence clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormality uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification 3 , unstable angina poorly control arrhythmia . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry . Patients history proteinuria grade ≥ 2 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , men able father child , unwilling use medically acceptable method contraception trial least three month end active therapy . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Persistence clinically relevant therapy relate toxicity previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . This include hemoglobin hematologic laboratory criterion , long eligibility criterion meet Other malignancy within past 5 year nonmelanoma superficial skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Concurrent medical condition injury may increase risk toxicity , include ongoing active infection , history significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer ( congenital bleeding disorder , acquire bleed disorder within one year ) , history HIVpositive , active chronic hepatitis C and/or B infection . Known suspect active drug alcohol abuse . Gastrointestinal disorder abnormality would interfere absorption study drug . Patients unable orally swallow study medication .
