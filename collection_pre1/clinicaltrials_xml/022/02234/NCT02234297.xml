	<brief_summary>Many type cancer primarily treat surgery patient survival directly relate extent tumor able remove . It often difficult surgeon distinguish tumor tissue normal tissue detect tumor cell spread original tumor site , result incomplete removal tumor reduce patient survival . In site , brain , critical avoid damage normal tissue around tumor prevent adverse effect surgery function . We hypothesize BLZ-100 improve surgical outcome allow surgeon visualize edge tumor small group cancer cell spread sit real-time operate . This safety study assess safety BLZ-100 patient gliomas undergoing surgery .</brief_summary>
