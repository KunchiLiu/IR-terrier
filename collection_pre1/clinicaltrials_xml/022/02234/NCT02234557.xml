	<brief_summary>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) tremendous individual societal impact , effectiveness current standard treatment limited . We examine novel treatment could remediate core feature ADHD thereby contribute sustained improvement behavioral control . This approach motivate mount evidence child ADHD show difficulty motor control , motor deficit strongly associate core behavioral feature ADHD . We employ Tai Chi , target improvement well-established behavioral physiologic measure motor control , , improvement ADHD symptom . The propose study offer immense potential development novel therapeutic approach ADHD little risk adverse reaction . The over-arching goal proposal examine movement-based mindfulness training therapeutic intervention child ADHD . This approach motivate two complimentary line evidence : 1 ) Children ADHD show impairment motor control parallel ( correlate ) core deficit behavioral control define disorder . 2 ) Gains cognitive behavioral control observe adult learn Tai Chi , dance , meditation . These line evidence provide substantial motivation propose investigation movement-based mindfulness training child ADHD . Specifically , propose evaluate establish Tai Chi-based intervention . We choose approach number reason : 1 ) Tai Chi among well-established movement-based intervention document therapeutic effect , include cognitive effect . 2 ) While many movement-based approach show evidence yield cognitive improvement Tai Chi provide excellent opportunity engagement 8-12 year old child form collaborative game `` push hand . '' 3 ) Tai Chi instruction consist gentle movement practice even physical limitation , readily available United States protocol develop study straightforward deploy national level . Hypothesis : After participate Tai Chi program , child ADHD show improvements behavioral physiologic measure motor control . We expect movement-based training result decrease ADHD symptom severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persistent poor outcome individual ADHD make imperative explore intervention approach beyond medication , particularly intervention could provide sustained improvement control hyperactive , impulsive distractible behavior . Two line evidence converge support movement-based mindfulness training intervention potential stand-alone adjunct treatment treatment ADHD symptom . First , decades research , include lab , establish many child ADHD show impairment motor control parallel impairment behavioral cognitive control . Second , mount evidence movement-based mindfulness intervention effective enhance behavioral control adult , although limited examination child . These line evidence suggest outstanding opportunity development novel treatment approach ADHD engagement motor system . In application propose examine efficacy specific movement-based mindfulness intervention child ADHD - Tai Chi . This approach choose number reason : 1 ) extensive documentation research literature , 2 ) engagement afford martial approach mindful movement , 3 ) scalability give exist availability Tai Chi instruction United States ease perform gentle Tai Chi movement even presence physical limitation . Consistent `` Fast-Fail '' approach first two year ( R21 phase ) investigate impact Tai Chi motor system target lab establish highly correlated measure classic ADHD symptom . Specifically , measure SICI ( short-interval intra-cortical inhibition via TMS ) overt movement behavior result failure motor control ( mirror overflow motor impersistence ) . Milestones comprise successful motor system target engagement context Tai Chi training . The finding lay foundation clinical exploration Tai Chi movement-based mindfulness training approach ADHD condition motor system implicate . Our brain-based approach provide clear path reliable assessment well integration cognitive neuroscience literature inhibition aspect cognitive control . The motor system provide locus integration multiple neural system , clear abnormality inhibitory function ADHD . An intervention target motor system stand make productive contact motor system target . Indeed , broad evidence efficacy Tai Chi ( mindfulness-based movement training ) address wide range issue , include high level cognitive function attentional control.2 The majority effect establish adult , give great brain plasticity document children,1 reason expect strong effect child . Indeed , success report child population early preschool.32 Moreover , recognize need physiologic biomarkers mindfulness movement train studies.15 Our robust ability track change specific motor marker behavioral physiologic ( TMS ) level , provide ideal target measure establish specificity Tai Chi train intervention . Overview intervention Tai Chi form exercise variety component strong cultural tradition . In consultation experience teacher Tai Chi , receive consistent feedback `` martial application , '' specifically push hand , likely valuable component training child high distractibility . Central martial practice Tai Chi collaborative game call `` Push Hands , '' partner attempt push one another balance without use strong effort . Push hand , Tai Chi inspire `` game '' use motivate engagement slower , focus movement training : Tai Chi warm-up , postural breathing exercise , section Tai Chi form . We expect component collectively drive learn development behavioral control motor domain , high potential impact feature ADHD . The Tai Chi instructor , graduate student Johns Hopkins Tai Chi club , extensive experience youth instruction , well keen understand relationship Tai Chi `` hard '' martial art 20 year practice martial art , include 12 year Tai Chi . An assistant instructor additionally engage assist maintain class focus . All instructor certify ethical treatment human subject , well standard youth physical education . Sessions hold athletic facility Kennedy Krieger Institute ( KKI ) Greenspring campus . The athletic facility design equip child range ability part LEAP Program ( Life-skills Education Students Autism Pervasive Behavioral Challenges ) . It advantageously locate campus convenient Baltimore area family . The facility moreover high-impact float rubber floor . This environmentally friendly slip-resistant flooring provide cushioning , reduce fatigue potential injury participant physical activity . Recruitment test Recruitment , preintervention data collection ( see detail ) , logistical preparation commence early practicable funding period establish . At least three session complete , schedule ensure session school year summer break . Six-eight student enrolled session , target five-seven child successfully complete session participate preintervention ( three week period prior start class ) , midpoint intervention ( week four-six class ) , postintervention ( three week class complete ) physiologic behavioral assessment . Outcomes computed difference preintervention postintervention score , midpoint intervention score use give sense timecourse change measure . It expect one student average unable successfully complete give class series . Enrollment procedure adapt necessary . As per `` intent treat '' approach ( see ) , child include primary analysis irrespective adherence protocol ( i.e. , attendance ) . However , child may request leave class absence become disruptive . In total , anticipate minimum 18 participant complete training total 21 child enrol .</detailed_description>
