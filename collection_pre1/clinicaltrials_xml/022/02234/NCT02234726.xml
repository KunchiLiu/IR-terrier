	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate impact community-based early childhood development ( ECD ) program child physical cognitive development . Central ECD program cadre community-based health worker call Child Development Agents ( CDAs ) . CDAs four main task responsibility : 1 ) Biweekly screen management ( include referral ) acute malnutrition child ; 2 ) Encouragement caregiver utilize routine care service child ( immunization , growth monitoring , vitamin A supplementation ) ; 3 ) Screening symptom acute disease include malaria , diarrhea , pneumonia referral diagnosis treatment ; 4 ) Organization mentor weekly meeting caregiver discuss parent issue promote early childhood cognitive stimulation . Protocols community-based evaluation management child acute malnutrition base draft Zambian Community Integrated Management Acute Malnutrition ( CIMAM ) guideline . Children complicate severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) refer near health center evaluation , SAM confirm base mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) , refer inpatient feeding center management . All child moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM ) uncomplicated SAM administer appetite test health center . Children pas appetite test manage locally outpatient . Children acute infectious disease treat follow Ministry Health 's adaptation Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) guideline complicate SAM feed difficulty refer high level facility ( feed center ) . As part ECD program , clinical staff member study health center receive short training improve adherence IMCI CIMAM guideline . One aspect IECDZ program particular interest policy evaluation perspective explicit focus improve communication CDAs clinical staff facility handle undernourished child . As part ECD program , CDAs meet staff referral health center regular basis , discus strategy improve nutritional outcome child fall behind . In addition regular meeting , ECD program strengthens linkages CDAs health center novel mHealth intervention . When CDA refer child health center evaluation acute malnutrition , danger sign , signs/symptoms suggestive malaria , pneumonia diarrhea , officer-in-charge health center receive short message service ( SMS ) paper referral form make aware child provisional diagnosis . Once referred child attend facility , health center staff member send SMS back CDA make aware final diagnosis management plan . If health center refers child feed center , SMS send feed center along paper referral form . All text message within proposed system free charge end user . The mobile health ( mHealth ) system meant improve communication health worker operate various level health system . Caregivers receive SMS update . Rather , CDAs communicate update health nutritional status child directly caregiver . The primary objective ECD program : 1 . Improve community-based screening uncomplicated acute malnutrition strengthen referral quality management malnourish child local health center ; 2 . Conduct community-based screen referral management common childhood disease ( malaria , diarrhea , pneumonia ) ; 3 . Strengthen continuum care child acute malnutrition disease use innovative mHealth intervention link CDAs , child screen , health center feed center ; 4 . Improve early cognitive development community-based weekly meeting caregiver . The propose evaluation structure around ECD program roll , employ cluster-randomized trial design . For purpose evaluation , cluster demarcate boundary health zone , geographic unit define use Zambia Ministry Health determine catchment population public health facility . Each health zone child recruit within zone comprise cluster trial . The ECD intervention implement 15 randomly select health zone across five facility start August 2014 . The remain 15 health zone catchment five study facility continue use current practice serve control . Within health zone , total around 20 child/caregiver pair recruit enrolled evaluation . In total , investigator anticipate around 300 child/caregiver pair enrol arm study , total 600 child/caregiver pair . The study sample randomize level health zone either ECD program control group use stratified random sample method . Prior randomization , basic demographic information collect health zone , include : distance study health center , total population , number eligible child age 6 12 month . Next , zone stratify accord demographic data . Finally , within strata zone assign either ECD intervention control group use random number generator achieve balance within stratum . Study data collect four main source : 1 ) baseline interview study caregiver ; 2 ) endline interview caregiver child assessment ; 3 ) IECDZ program monitoring system , include CDA record SMS software ; 4 ) semi-structured interview CDAs clinic staff . Baseline caregiver interview - Study CDAs conduct baseline survey control intervention household include : ) basic demographic socioeconomic status , b ) availability book , toy read material home , time spent caregiver read child , well time spent caregiver play child , c ) anthropometric screening ( weight , height , MUAC ) , ) review vaccination child health visit use child health card , e ) assessment maternal caregiver mental well-being , f ) assessment maternal depression self-reporting questionnaire-20 ( SRQ-20 ) , g ) presence early childhood development program community . End line caregiver interview child assessment - Twelve month enrollment child visit final interview assessment . This assessment include question ask baseline well assessment child development use standardize testâ€”the INTERGROWTH 21st century assessment tool . ECD program monitoring system - Data key process indicator collect ECD program record assess activity CDAs study clinic . Important indicator include : ) volume CDA household visit ; b ) volume child identify referred malnutrition and/or disease ; c ) volume successful referral ; ) volume SMS send CDAs study clinic . Additional ECD program monitoring system dedicate caregiver group ' cognitive stimulation : ) frequency caregiver group , b ) caregiver knowledge topic cover curriculum , c ) measure caregiver-child interaction quality . These data exist control area , use evaluate impact ECD program . However , data provide important information use well understand program impact identify . Interviews CDAs clinic staff - A series semi-structured interview conduct CDAs clinic staff member assess awareness child nutrition disease issue general perception ECD program . These interview conduct study CDAs staff study facility three time point . For analysis , primary independent variable interest receipt ECD program . Assuming proper randomization , anticipate factor might potentially confound relationship interest uncorrelated receipt program . We compare baseline characteristic two group assess balance . We collect data potential confounders increase precision , analyze heterogeneity , necessary , control potential imbalance . Potential confounders include : maternal paternal education , asset , income employment , family composition child gender . We also control baseline height-for-age z-score baseline child health measure . Categorical variable compare group use chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test cell size small ; continuous variable use t-test normally distribute non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test , non-normal . We model impact measure function treatment control use standard regression framework .</detailed_description>
