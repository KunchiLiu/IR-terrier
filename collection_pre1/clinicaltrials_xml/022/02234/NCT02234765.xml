	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) characterize manifestation excessive sleepiness secondary repeat obstruction upper airway sleep cognitive-behavioral , respiratory , cardiac , metabolic inflammatory disorder . Epidemiological study country show OSA highly prevalent disease general population , affect 2-4 % adult population . The important clinical manifestation OSAS deterioration quality life increase cardiovascular disease . OSA also associate traffic accident . Therefore , consider medical complication OSA , well sociolaboral impact negative impact quality life survival ; state disease public health problem require physician identify patient eligible treatment . Moreover , show undiagnosed patient , duplicate consumption health resource , compare diagnosis treatment establish . Finally , highly effective treatment use positive pressure upper airway ( CPAP ) show effective cost-effective . The current situation patient diagnose OSA receive different treatment monitor controlled Sleep Units ( SU ) oversized medicine specialist expense primary care ( PC ) . Our work hypothesis : `` By coordination action various level include interactive training equipment AP , use bilateral ( SU-AP ) electronic medical record use new technology achieve AP satisfactory management diagnostic therapeutic process patient suspect OSA . Patients assist area level clinical response , satisfaction , compliance avoidance complication , similar obtain monitoring SU . In addition , management AP cost-effective SU . ''</brief_summary>
