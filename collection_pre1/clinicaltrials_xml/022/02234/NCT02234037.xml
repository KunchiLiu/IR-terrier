	<brief_summary>STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) common type blood cancer adult , common increase age . AML harder treat old patient , typically poor response standard chemotherapy . Patients AML typically give intensive induction chemotherapy , many old patient tolerate side effect therapy . Decitabine show active well tolerate frail patient AML ; however , patient still relapse . Recent study suggest improve performance status fitness old AML patient prior induction chemotherapy may help lessen side effect . This study test combination decitabine treatment physical exercise elderly patient AML candidate standard induction chemotherapy . STUDY DESCRIPTION : This pilot study test combination decitabine treatment 8-week physical exercise program AML patient ≥ 60 year age candidate standard induction chemotherapy . Patients eligible take part must give write agreement enrol . This study enroll 20 patient candidate standard induction chemotherapy . Patients begin 8-week program physical exercise , include 2-3 session per week supervise physical therapist . During 8-week period , patient give 2 cycle decitabine therapy ( daily infusion 5 consecutive day 28-day cycle ) . Patients follow assess safety tolerability program . Patients also give blood sample use assess response treatment . Patients evaluate physical fitness 8-week exercise program complete questionnaires assess quality life program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : • Number patient age 60 old newly diagnose AML candidate standard induction chemotherapy complete 8-week program physical conditioning decitabine treatment . The goal set 30 % 20 enrolled patient complete 8 week decitabine physical conditioning program . Secondary Objectives : - Number patient adverse event measure safety tolerability physical conditioning program decitabine therapy . - Number patient overall response ( complete response , disease-free survival [ DFS ] , overall survival [ OS ] ) rehabilitate patient conclusion 8-week program . - Changes quality life among study subject 8-week exercise program . - Changes cytokine profile draw baseline , 4 week 8 week . Treatment Plan : - Twenty subject , age 60 old newly diagnose AML deem refer physician candidate standard induction chemotherapy recruit inpatient outpatient service Emory University Hospital Winship Cancer Institute Emory University . - After sign informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) form , screen evaluation perform . Subjects eligible meet physical therapist enroll 8-week program physical conditioning . - Each patient participate 2-3 exercise session per week supervise physical therapist home exercise program . Evaluations physical fitness perform 8-week exercise program . Each exercise session customize base patient 's baseline fitness level . Subjects ' heart rate , blood pressure , rate perceive exertion score monitor exercise treatment session . - Patients ' fitness conclusion physical therapy regimen assess check improvement Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status least 1 point baseline 25 % improvement Special Forces ( SF ) -36 fitness score system . - Decitabine infuse accord standard care practice daily infusion 5 consecutive day 28-day cycle 2 cycle ( 1 cycle = 28 day ) 8 week physical-conditioning period . - Patients assessed hematology provider weekly basis , adverse events/toxicities record ongoing basis . - Bone marrow biopsy obtain baseline , 8 week , clinically indicate assess response . A sample marrow collect correlative assay coincident standard care collection . - Peripheral blood ( 20 mL ) collect correlative study baseline , 4 week 8 week . Assessment Disease Response : - Complete blood count ( CBC ) differential obtain weekly bone marrow biopsy aspirate obtain clinically indicated assess response treatment . - Active participation study end 1 month completion 8-week exercise/decitabine program . Thereafter , long term follow-up survival perform record review telephone interview patient longer follow-up Winship Cancer Institute Emory University . Monitoring : The study monitor Data Safety Monitoring Committee study institution . Statistical Methods : - Feasibility : Based data show 50 % old fit AML patient tolerate 4-week exercise regimen , feasibility define : - Completion 8-week physical conditioning regimen/decitabine program least 30 % study subject . - The proportion patient full treatment delivery estimate exact 90 % confidence interval . - Assessment fitness study population undertaken 4 week enrollment conclusion 8-week physical therapy regimen . - Kaplan-Meier curve use estimate distribution time relapse , disease-free survival , overall survival .</detailed_description>
