	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial pre-operative oral dexamethasone v placebo improvement quality recovery surgery . The study population limit breast surgery patient . The investigator also look effect intervention post operative nausea vomit . Patients recruit date surgery complete Quality Recovery-40 ( QOR-40 ) questionnaire surgery 24 hour post op . They also complete Clinically significant nausea vomit score upon discharge post anesthesia recovery room , repeat 24 hour post op .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This single centre randomize , double blind , parallel-group , intention treat , control trial . Patients randomly assign pre-operative oral dexamethasone placebo Group 1 : Pre-operative oral dexamethasone ( 10mg-2 hour pre-induction ) Group 2 : Placebo Sample Size : 80 patient ( 80 % power detect difference 10 point primary endpoint ) Study duration : 8 month Primary endpoint : Quality recovery 24 hour post operation , measure QoR-40 Secondary endpoint : Clinically significant nausea vomit discharge Post-Anesthesia Recovery Room ( PARR ) 24 hour . Study hypotheses : Pre-operative oral dexamethasone improve patient quality recovery compare placebo . Secondary hypothesis : Pre-operative dexamethasone decrease clinically significant post operative nausea vomit post anesthesia recovery room benefit endure 24 hour . Importance : Small study adult population suggest IV dexamethasone may improve quality recovery . IV dexamethasone widely use label postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) prophylaxis , oral dexamethasone study indication base pharmacodynamics dexamethasone , modulation nucleolar transcription likely important dexamethasone 's clinical effect ; early administration time likely benefit , could facilitate oral ( vs IV ) route administration . This study provide preliminary support ( absence support ) routine , inexpensive intervention optimize patient outcome . Background : Single , low dose perioperative dexamethasone safe beneficial common time administration maximize effectiveness . IV dexamethasone improve quality recovery patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy provide potential 1.5 mm improvement VAS pain score first 6 hour post mastectomy , questionable clinical significance . A study determine dexamethasone improve quality recovery patient undergo breast surgery need order provide evidence change practice pre-operative oral dexamethasone offer potential routine , low cost administration without uncomfortable side effect . Methods : Patients recruit pre-operatively contact telephone preliminary consent . They receive consent document morning surgery randomize time , complete pre-operative QOR-40 receive oral dexamethasone placebo . During general anaesthesia ( GA ) receive IV Ondansetron blood glucose measure 2 hour skin incision . On discharge PARR clinically significant nausea vomit scale score record , repeat 24 hour post op . They also complete QOR-40 24 hour post op . Analysis : Data analyze use analysis variance , mixed model t-tests . Potential Pitfalls : As QOR-40 instrument survey , prone inter intra patient variability . The investigator control inter-patient variability patient complete instrument surgery collect individual baseline . The investigator rely 25 % recruitment rate eligible patient order complete study state timeframe . The study important narrow focus , feasible perform subgroup analysis small study size .</detailed_description>
