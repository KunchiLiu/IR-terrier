	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesise cancer patient systemic anticancer therapy measure home blood count , temperature , record qualitative data transfer result electronically hospital clinical team . A low neutrophil blood cell count ( neutropenia ) dose-limiting toxicity systemic anti-cancer therapy ( SACT ) life-threatening complicate sepsis . Neutrophil count usually obtain venepuncture health-care professional . The Minicare H-2000 new device facilitate home self-testing blood count , temperature symptom . The four component ) blood count recorder use capillary sample obtain via finger-prick ii ) Bluetooth link thermometer iii ) tele-hub collect patient-reported outcome iv ) secure communication 3G network . The investigator propose single-centre , non-randomised feasibility study test process patient chemotherapy use Minicare H-2000 deliver self-tested blood count reading , temperature qualitative data electronically hospital clinical team . The aim test training patient use finger-prick method obtain blood count , patient ability perform test , retention training , ability Minicare H-2000 facilitate data transfer test secondary care interface . This study provide preliminary data potential Minicare H-2000 prevent waste hospital journey blood count recover sufficiently subsequent SACT cycle . The investigator intend obtain informed consent recruit 30 80 patient study perform addition current local standard care . This study enable identification suboptimal area process prior investigate application minicare H-2000 within oncology improve clinical patient pathway . The investigator ongoing intention trial use Minicare H-2000 reduce frequency severity neutropenic complication , prevent waste hospital journey hospital resource , reduce non-elective hospital admission personalise delivery SACT .</brief_summary>
