	<brief_summary>The primary aim pilot study evaluate feasibility safety four different type intradialytic exercise ( exercise perform dialysis ) program : resistance , aerobic , combine resistance aerobic , flexibility ( attention control ) . The secondary aim study estimate effect aerobic resistance exercise , compare attention control : health-related quality life , test physical performance , strength , physical activity outside dialysis unit . The result study used inform plan full-scale efficacy study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility Safety Intradialytic Exercise Program : DIALY-SIZE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment : participant recruit study coordinator regular hemodialysis shift . This quaternary outpatient dialysis unit serve approximately 110 patient . Randomization allocation : use permute block design randomly vary block size eight twelve . The randomization sequence computer generate randomization one 4 group 1:1:1:1 ratio . Allocation conceal serially number , opaque , seal envelope . Data collection : demographic data , length time hemodialysis , cause ESRD , access type , comorbidities , number medication , functional status , comorbidities , dialysis prescription collect . The laboratory value dialysis prescription collect dialysis unit chart use recent monthly blood-work provincial laboratory repository . The amount intensity exercise perform well participant 's heart rate blood pressure exercise session record exercise session . The exercise form participant 's dialysis session review weekly miss data . Forms empty field classify incomplete possible , appropriate staff ask verify query . The occurrence adverse event collect four randomization groups.The hemodialysis run-sheet , nursing note , exercise data collection form review weekly occurence adverse event . Hemodialysis unit staff exercise trainer instruct report adverse event ( define priori ) occur . In addition , prior exercise session , participant ask new health problem symptoms since last exercise session . Missing data : conditional participant 's consent , outcome data collect participant drop . For participant wish follow miss data , baseline data carry forward . Safety : due short duration small size study , formal safety trial management board establish . A nephrologist affiliate study review SAEs occur . The nephrologist determine SAE associate intervention whether individual 's participation require modification discontinuation . Statistical analysis plan : descriptive statistic use compare clinical characteristic four group baseline . All analysis follow intention treat principle . Safety : primary analysis , adverse event report number event directly relate intervention compare control , randomization group . In secondary analysis , adverse event occur study analyze . The frequency event compare use ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis appropriate , appropriate post-hoc test detect difference randomization group . To explore effect aerobic resistance exercise component HRQOL estimate absolute change score 12 week relative baseline physical component summary score ( PCS ) , mental component summary score ( MCS ) , kidney-disease specific score ( KDCS ) . We report absolute change sub-scores component summary score . We use method estimate difference score test physical performance strength . Assuming statistical interaction ( indication literature ) , estimate efficacy aerobic intervention compare participant receive aerobic exercise group ( aerobic combine exercise group versus resistance control exercise group ) similarly resistance-training group . Final score compare use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust baseline score main effect term . The final score present adjusted difference mean . To correct multiple comparison combine exercise group , base Bonferroni procedure significance level le 0.025 consider significant . The method use analyze difference test physical functioning strength . The interaction estimate secondary analysis . Due small sample size , subgroup analysis perform .</detailed_description>
