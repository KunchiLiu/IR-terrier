	<brief_summary>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) inherit immunodeficiency disorder result defect prevent white blood cell effectively kill bacteria , fungi microorganism . Chronic granulomatous inflammation may compromise vital organ account additional morbidity . CGD think affect approximately 1 200,000 person , although real incidence might higher due under-diagnosis milder phenotype . The first gene therapy approach X-CGD show effective gene therapy require bone-marrow ( BM ) condition chemotherapy make space gene-modified cell engraft . These study demonstrate transplantation gene modify stem cell lead production white blood cell could clear exist infection . However , trail use mouse-derived retroviral vector complicate development myelodysplasia leukemia-like growth blood cell . This trial evaluate new lentiviral vector may able correct defect , much low risk complication . This study prospective non-controlled , non-randomized Phase I/II clinical trial ass safety , feasibility efficacy cellular gene therapy patient chronic granulomatous disease use transplantation autologous bone marrow CD34+ cell transduce ex vivo G1XCGD lentiviral vector contain human CGD gene . Primary objective include evaluation safety evaluation efficacy biochemical functional reconstitution progeny engraft cell stability 12 month . Secondary objective include evaluation clinical efficacy , longitudinal evaluation clinical effect term augment immunity bacterial fungal infection , transduction CD34+ hematopoietic cell X-CGD patient ex vivo lentivirus-mediated gene transfer , evaluation engraftment kinetics stability . Approximately 3-5 patient treat per site goal 10 total patient treat G1XCGD lentiviral vector .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gene Therapy Using Lentiviral Vector Treat X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The therapeutic product evaluate autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) modify ex vivo transduction use pCCLchimGP91WPRE lentiviral vector ( G1XCGD Modified Autologous BM CD34 cell ) contain human CGD gene . The G1XCGD lentiviral vector 3rd generation self-inactivating lentiviral vector directs gp91phox expression codon-optimized form CYBB gene preferentially myeloid cell , modify WPRE ( PRE4 ) . G1XCGD integrative , 3rd generation replication-defective , self-inactivating ( SIN ) HIV-derived Lentiviral ( LV ) vector , mutate Woodchuck hepatitis virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element ( WPRE ) sequence . ( Figure 1 ) A LV vector derive HIV-1 chosen respect LV natural property : genetically stable , permanently integrate genome transduce cell provide long-term gene expression vitro vivo . The transduction Hematopoietic Stem Cells ( HSC ) LV achieve limited pre-activation cell short-term culture cytokine , condition compatible preservation self-renewing capacity cell . These property make LV suitable ex-vivo gene therapy strategy use HSC . G1XCGD provirus include chimeric promoter design regulate transgene expression myeloid cell transgene call GP91 ( also know CYBB ) , codon-optimized cDNA sequence human CYBB gene also know GP91-PHOX NOX2 gene : The promoter synthetic chimeric element create fusion c-Fes Cathepsin G minimal 5'-flanking region . Cathepsin G serine protease store azurophil granule neutrophil granulocyte . Part chimeric promoter contains bind site myeloid transcription factor C/EBP PU.1from upstream region transcription start site Cathepsin G gene . The part chimeric promoter human c-Fes sequence add enhance Cathepsin G promoter activity granulocytic cell . The result chimeric promoter able ) regulate expression GP91 transgene myeloid cell specific manner ii ) effectively restore NADPH-oxidase activity granulocyte , report Santilli et al . ( Santilli et al. , 2011 ) confirm preclinical study conduct G1XCGD vector . The GP91 transgene code 570 amino-acid cytochrome b-245 , 91 kD beta polypeptide also know NADPH-oxidase catalytic subunit gp91-phox , cytochrome b-245 heavy chain , gp91-phox protein .</detailed_description>
