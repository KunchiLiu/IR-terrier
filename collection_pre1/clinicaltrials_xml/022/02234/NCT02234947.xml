	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) characterize progressive destruction insulin produce beta cell , result lifelong dependence exogenous insulin . While beta cell make less 1 % pancreas , study demonstrate T1D associate marked reduction pancreatic mass diagnosis disease progress . As , pancreatic volume assessment , ultrasonography ( US ) MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) , could utilize marker beta cell function high risk patient , non-invasive pancreatic imaging could become important part stag diabetes risk . As , primary goal study measure pancreatic volume compare difference volume new onset T1D patient , antibody positive subject risk diabetes , antibody negative individual , healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants blood test two image test . The blood test tell u well pancreas work . The imaging test measure volume pancreas . There one study visit associate study . Blood drawn 5 different blood test . The participant eat drink 8 hour blood test ( water allow ) . The blood send lab . The amount blood take equal 1 table spoon . Here blood test perform : 1 . C-peptide - used measure insulin make cell pancreas . 2 . Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) - measure blood sugar control last 2 3 month . 3 . Serum trypsin - use measure exocrine pancreatic function . 4 . Glucose - use measure amount blood sugar body . 5 . Autoantibodies ( diabetes relate ) - protein make body 's immune system . They sign cell pancreas produce insulin could damage . For image procedure participant eat least 8 hour image procedure ( water okay ) . Your empty stomach allow u picture pancreas well . 1 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure allow doctor look inside body use scanner sends strong magnetic field radio wave involve radiation exposure . 2 . Ultrasound ( US ) device consist computer transducer use scan body . A transducer small hand-held device size bar soap attach scanner cord . A lubricating gel spread skin area examine , transducer press firmly skin obtain image . These image test allow u measure volume pancreas . You get sedation test . If tolerate MRI , US .</detailed_description>
