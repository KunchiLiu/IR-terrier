	<brief_summary>The investigator research study learn skin heals many microscopic skin biopsy collect . Skin-grafting life-saving procedure people large area skin wound cause burn trauma . Conventional autologous ( self ) skin graft technique require creation large donor site wound , cause numerous complication include pain , infection , blistering , discoloration , scar . Based previous research , many adverse effect improve , even eliminate , harvest skin tissue small biopsy . These `` micro-biopsies '' less size sew pin . Then , put back together skin graft . This concept base clinical observation fractional photothermolysis laser therapy , FDA approve laser previously develop investigator research group treatment scar age skin . With laser technique , thousand million small burn produce laser patient 's skin , skin respond heal damage area create new healthy skin within day without scar . Although result laser treatment well-known , know happen harvest skin use needle instead use laser cut skin . The investigator also would like understand body heals skin . Understanding work help understand wound heal , may lead future treatment heal large wound , disfigure burn scar , prevent scar formation . A tummy tuck ( abdominoplasty surgery ) do remove excessive skin belly . This elective surgery , word , optional usually do cosmetic reason ( improve appearance ) . The skin belly remove abdominoplasty surgery ( tummy tuck ) discard . The skin area remove call `` pre-abdominoplasty skin '' . The investigator would like study effect micro-biopsies pre-abdominoplasty skin exam skin heals time study skin remove abdominoplasty surgery . This pilot study . Pilot study do small group subject learn large study would useful . The investigator ask subject take part study healthy abdominoplasty surgery ( tummy tuck ) schedule Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) plastic surgeon . The investigator enroll 28 subject research study , MGH . The Department Defense pay study do .</brief_summary>

Subjects immunocompromised immunosuppressed* 2 . Subject unable comply treatment , home care followup visit 3 . Subject infection dermatologic condition area treat 4 . Subjects personal family history keloid formation . 5 . Subjects preexist scar , tattoo , birthmark , physical feature area treat , experimental outcome may confound . 6 . Subjects history coagulopathy , take anticoagulant 7 . Subjects take daily oral aspirin . 8 . Subject currently enrol clinical study unapproved investigational drug device . 9 . Subjects contraindication elective abdominoplasty , determine treat plastic surgeon and/or preop anesthesiologist . 10 . Subjects current drug alcohol addiction . 11 . Subjects pregnant and/or breastfeed 12 . Subjects tape adhesive allergy 13 . Subjects know allergy injectable lidocaine topical anesthetic 14 . Subjects uncontrolled unstable chronic disease diabetes , hepatitis , hypertension , etc . 15 . Subjects take oral corticosteroid topical steroid study area . 16 . Subjects use prescription overthecounter medication cosmetic containing : retinoids , glycolic acid , salicylic acid remedy might affect heal process . ( Nonmedicated moisturizers ok ) . 17 . Subjects enrol clinical study take unknown notFDA approved medication . 18 . Any condition laboratory value would , professional opinion investigator , potentially affect subject 's response integrity data would pose unacceptable risk subject . Notes : *About AntiInflammatory Medication Immune Status The inflammatory response associate tissue wound know substantial effect process scarring , therefore subject immunocompromised , undergo antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy exclude study . All new medication report study doctor visit .</criteria>
