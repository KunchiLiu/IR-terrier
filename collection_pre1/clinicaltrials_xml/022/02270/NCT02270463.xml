	<brief_summary>This non-randomized open label multi-center study . Patients first complete remission ( CR ) follow induction therapy treat SL-401 , administer brief intravenous infusion 5 consecutive day every 28 day 6 cycle . Stage 1 consist period approximately 6-9 patient treat SL-401 3 dose level . During Stage 2 , approximately 24-29 patient minimal residual disease ( MRD ) bone marrow treat maximum tolerated dose maximum test dose multiple dose-limiting toxicity observe ( identify Stage 1 ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . The patient diagnosis AML accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . 2 . The patient receive induction chemotherapy regimen may receive postremission consolidation therapy ( except transplant ) prior screen . 3 . The patient achieve first second CR CRi . For patient without evidence MRD CR/CRi , CR ( CRi ) must initially identify within 12 month prior screen . OR The patient achieve first second CR CRi evidence MRD determine locally least 6 month post stem cell transplant without evidence acute chronic graftversushost disease posttransplant receive immunosuppressant therapy least 14 day prior SL401 therapy . 4 . The patient adverse risk disease AML otherwise substantial risk relapse , include limited : adverse karyotype , FLT3 internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutation , history antecedent hematologic disorder ( AHD ) , therapyrelated AML , history require 1 cycle intensive induction chemotherapy achieve first remission , and/or presence persistent MRD ( detect cytogenetics , molecular marker , flow cytometry ) point initial induction cycle . ( A comprehensive listing karyotype mutation indicative highrisk AML provide appendix protocol ) . 5 . For patient enrol Stage 2 , bone marrow evaluation determine locally within previous 6 month indicate presence MRD . ( A comprehensive listing methodology evaluation MRD provide appendix protocol ) . 6 . The patient consider immediate candidate allogeneic stem cell transplant determine investigator . 7 . The patient ≥18 year old . 8 . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score ( PS ) 02 . 9 . The patient adequate organ function , include cardiac , renal , hepatic function : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥institutional low limit normal measure multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) scan 2dimensional ( 2D ) echocardiography ( ECHO ) within 28 day prior start therapy clinically significant abnormality 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL Serum albumin ≥3.2 g/dL absence receipt ( IV ) albumin within previous 72 hour . Bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) ≤2.5 × ULN . 10 . The patient adequate bone marrow reserve : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 0.5 × 109/L Platelets ≥30 × 109/L 11 . The patient woman child bear potential ( WOCBP ) negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior SL 401 treatment ( interval shorter 1 week acceptable require institutional guideline ) . 12 . A write voluntarily sign informed consent must obtain patient legally authorize representative , accordance local regulation , initiation study related procedure . The patient legally authorize representative must able read understand inform consent form ( ICF ) . 13 . The patient able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement , include followup survival assessment . 14 . The patient ( male female ) agree use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study , continue use acceptable contraceptive method 2 month last infusion SL 401 . 1 . The patient diagnosis AML associate karyotype ( 15 ; 17 ) . 2 . The patient persistent clinically significant Grade ≥2 toxicities induction consolidation therapy ( exclude alopecia , nausea , fatigue , liver function test [ mandate inclusion criterion ] ) readily manage supportive measure . 3 . The patient receive treatment another investigational agent within 14 day screen . 4 . The patient previously receive treatment SL 401 . 5 . The patient active malignancy and/or cancer history ( exclude AML antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome [ MDS ] ) may confound assessment study endpoint . Patients past cancer history ( within 2 year entry ) substantial potential recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must discuss Sponsor study entry . Patients follow neoplastic diagnosis eligible : nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ ( include superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder ) , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , organconfined prostate cancer evidence progressive disease . 6 . The patient clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class 3 4 congestive heart failure , uncontrolled angina , history myocardial infarction , unstable angina stroke within 6 month prior study entry , uncontrolled hypertension clinically significant arrhythmia control medication ) . 7 . The patient uncontrolled , clinically significant pulmonary disease ( e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension ) opinion Investigator would put patient significant risk pulmonary complication study . 8 . The patient know active suspected central nervous system ( CNS ) leukemia . If suspect , CNS leukemia rule relevant imaging and/or examination cerebrospinal fluid . 9 . The patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled infection , disseminate intravascular coagulation , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . The patient pregnant breast feeding . 11 . The patient know positive status human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active chronic Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. 12 . The patient oxygendependent . 13 . The patient medical condition opinion Investigator place patient unacceptably high risk toxicity .</criteria>
