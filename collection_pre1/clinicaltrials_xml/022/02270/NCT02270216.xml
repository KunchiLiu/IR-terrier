	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Responses Static Dynamic Exercise Elderly With Isolated Systolic Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Design The propose study experimental study design . The study subject approval Ethical committee Khon Kaen University subject ask give write agreement participate . 2 . Subjects Elderly subject isolate systolic hypertension recruit primary care unit community outpatient department Srinakarind hospital Khon Kaen province . Healthy normotensive subject live independently normal physical activity recruit community . Inclusion criterion : Subjects 60 year age essential isolated systolic hypertension ( stage I-II base recommendation JNC-VII ) hypertension group normal blood pressure healthy group . Good communication , independent physical activity . The healthy subject non-smokers , non-obese , free sign symptom disease reveal medical history Exclusion criterion : Essential hypertension stage III secondary hypertension , history respiratory disease , heart disease , renal disease , blindness , cerebrovascular disease , exercise limit pain Subjects pass inclusion criterion exclusion criterion undertake dynamic exercise test static hand-grip exercise pressor test cardiopulmonary research room , Khon Kaen University 3 . Outcome measurements The main outcome measure change blood pressure heart rate two form exercise . Blood pressure : Blood pressure measure digital bedside monitor ( Figure 1 ) . An inflatable cuff place around subject 's arm one inch patient 's elbow brachial artery . Resting blood pressure measure sit position rest 15 minute Heart rate : Heart rate measure rest exercise . ECG electrode attach lead II configuration connect BIOPAC system . The heart rate determine R-R interval data analyze BIOPAC system . 4 . Procedures protocol After interview inform various test ask provide informed consent , subject undertake two different exercise test , order randomize balanced design . The subject ask smoke , take alcohol caffeinated drink within 2 hour test . Cycling exercise : The dynamic exercise subject sit cycle ergometer ( Monark 828 E ) . Resting heart rate measure 2 minute start exercise . The exercise level limit 50 % estimate maximum heart rate reserve . Maximum heart rate estimate 207-0.7*age ( Gellish et al. , 2007 ) heart rate reserve ( HRR ) maximum minus rest heart rate . Subjects pedal 50 rpm 1 min load 3 minute load 0.5 Kp ( 25W ) increase load 1 Kp next 3 minute 1.5 Kp , necessary , 3 minute target heart rate 50 % HRR reach . Subjects ask level perception dyspnea use visual analog scale every 3 minute end load . Static exercise pressor response : The static exercise pressor response test use isometric handgrip leave hand . The forearm support arm rest elbow flex . The maximum voluntary contraction force measure best three attempt . After 2 minute rest , subject perform 2 minute isometric hand grip contraction 30 % MVC . Circulatory occlusion ( 50 mmHg supra-systolic pressure ) start 1.30 min continue 2 minute end isometric handgrip exercise . Following release cuff 2 minute recovery . The blood pressure heart rate measure end minute rest , isometric handgrip , circulatory occlusion recovery . Subjects instruct breathe normally test avoid Valsalva maneuver ; breathe frequency monitor handgrip pressor test use capnography . 5 . Data statistical analysis Data express mean Â± SD . Changes data post test baseline . Will test paired t-test . Significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
