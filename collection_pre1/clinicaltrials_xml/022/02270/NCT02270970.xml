	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : This study determine clinical response belimumab use SRI 4 ( SLE Responder Index ) use Phase III belimumab trial lead approval FDA . The population enter similar Phase III study population However , case background medication withdraw entry brief steroid rescue intramuscular depomedrol provide immediate relief cover delay belimumab effect . The co-primary objective determine time disease flare compare historical control study ( Biomarkers Lupus Disease ) determine whether belimumab responder ( define SLE Responder Index ) 50 % decrease predefined BLAST signal ( BlyS Activity Signal Test ) non-responders . This pilot study power draw firm conclusion response rate absence ongoing standard care medication , 7-12 patient ( 20 complete 6 month endpoint ) meet SRI response criterion , feasibility large , placebo control trial would justify . The following instrument use measure clinical lupus activity study : BICLA , SRI 5 , change joint count , global SLEDAI , BILAG , CLASI , PGA , SF-36 LFA-REAL measure . The following definition clinical outcome measure : SRI stand SLE Responder Index composite score comprise 4 ( alternatively 5 ) point decrease SLEDAI ( SLE Disease Activity Index ) couple increase BILAG ( British Isles Lupus Assessment Group ) Index 10 % increase Physician 's Global Assessment . The global SLEDAI BILAG simply comparison total SLEDAI numerical composite BILAG score baseline receive belimumab . The CLASI refers Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area Severity Index . LFA REAL stand Lupus Foundation America Rapid Evaluation Activity Lupus . The latter pilot instrument test study . We also integrate exploratory biologic discovery clinical trial support pre-specified exploratory biomarker discovery . Data generate might use help select appropriate patient subset future trial guide optimal dosing strategy . Optimizing patient selection dose important goal increase demonstrable effect size trial increase response rate treatment group . Thus , despite small pilot study , ambitious goal include provide potential preliminary data conducive optimize use belimumab . In general analysis also descriptive , however experience BOLD study suggest compare group 6-12 patient ( presumed clinical response rate ) enrich expression particular biomarker v different group 14-8 patient ( defined case basis non-response belimumab , BOLD study assignment IFN high v low subgroup ) may , virtue represent different immunologic subset disease , produce statistically significant result mean/median value number biomarkers . More importantly , compare `` '' level BLyS cytokine may quite sensitive belimumab clinical impact well . Obtaining kind preliminary data well understand optimal patient selection could valuable approach increase effect size future clinical trial . In fact , two Parts project ( single agent assessment biomarker assessment ) co-dependent , since increase likelihood interpretable data patient moderate severity . Indeed Part 2 would less feasible without strategy Part 1 decrease conflict immune signal background medication , cloud interpretation many treatment SLE past . Again , open label , six month study belimumab treatment give patient qualify receive treatment United States label . Additionally , entry study , patient must SLEDAI score least 6 identical disease activity minimum require belimumab Phase III study . Entry criterion require result full clinical evaluation , CBC differential , comprehensive metabolic profile ( include liver function test ) urinalysis ( reflex protein/creatinine ratio ) prior dose . The first dose give within 4 week screen visit may take place soon entry laboratory return . However , patient stop major immune suppressant and/or require steroid injection entry encourage wait minimum 3 week initial belimumab dose . Blood sample biomarkers ( see ) draw screen visit prior first dose maximize disease assessment prior steroid rescue well withdrawal background treatment . These provide baseline data BLAST expression profile patient , derive standardized study active SLE B Cells vitro B Cell gene expression response BLyS signal . The high BLAST signal record either screening ( prior steroid ) baseline ( immune suppression withdrawal ) employ baseline BLAST signal . Subjects evaluate monthly investigator/subinvestigator train SLEDAI , BILAG 2004 , CLASI . Additional assay patient report outcome include Short Form 36 ( SF36 ) LFA REAL physician patient endpoint . The co-primary clinical endpoint time flare last steroid injection compare result BOLD study . The co-primary mechanistic endpoint measure 3 month . This comparison rate BLAST 50 response ( 50 % decrease fold change expression BLAST panel gene compare healthy control ) meet clinical endpoint SRI 4 without use off-protocol medication . The SRI 4 endpoint meet meeting SRI criterion initiation off- protocol immune suppressant steroid . Although stipulation off-protocol medication integrate initial definition SRI require meet endpoint Phase III belimumab trial , since receive protocol treatment remove study count non-responders . This bring primary clinical endpoint line intent primary endpoint Phase III belimumab study . However patient necessarily remove study use protocol medication . After designated permanent non-responder primary endpoint patient might follow exploratory analysis improvement additive medication . This study enroll patient 20 complete protocol six month point . All patient receive belimumab 10 mg/kg baseline , 2 week later , 2 week q month . At monthly visit history , physical , blood test ( appropriate schedule ) complete outcome measure perform , adverse event report medication update perform . Subjects may continue take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication ( include prn NSAIDS ) 20 mg prednisone ( oral steroid equivalent ) daily screen study although steroid taper tolerate . If patient take hydroxychloroquine immune suppressant ( e.g . mycophenolate mofetil , azathioprine , leflunomide , methotrexate , calcineurin inhibitor ) screening , standard care treatment must stop prior baseline visit , preferably minimum two week baseline . Patients elect receive one depomedrol injection ( ) total 320 mg total individualized increment begin time screen visit ( necessary ) and/or include Month 2 visit . Daily oral steroid taper tolerated patient begin improve .</detailed_description>
