	<brief_summary>It well know deregulation immune response play major role many autoimmune disease , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) . The main objective protocol determine whether expression and/or function specific molecule deregulate immune cell patient SLE . By examine IRF4 , IRF5 , IBP/Def6 , SWAP-70 , Rock1 , Rock2 , specific signal molecule involve responsiveness sex hormone , investigator hypothesize deregulation expression function molecule result abnormality function immune cell , key factor autoimmunity . Peripheral blood lymphocytes healthy control patient SLE collect compare order determine specific immune cell ( IL-17 IL-21 ) deregulate patient SLE deregulation affect function . Specifically , immune cell isolate blood subject scientific testing ( QPCR , Western blotting , immunofluorescence assay , ELISA FACS analysis ) see expression function cell relate mechanism behind SLE . This case control study , case SLE compare control healthy volunteer assess risk factor . As healthy volunteer provide sample solely research purpose , standard care volunteer , exception positive HIV result screening . The Department Genetic Medicine enroll healthy control Hospital Special Surgery enroll subject Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) comparative analysis two cohort . Laboratory test blood sample do Hospital Special Surgery .</brief_summary>
