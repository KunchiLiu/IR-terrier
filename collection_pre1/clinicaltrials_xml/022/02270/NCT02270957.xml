	<brief_summary>This randomize , double blind , placebo control trial abatacept treatment lupus arthritis manifestation lupus . Patients lupus least 3 tender 3 swollen joint &lt; /= 20 mg prednisone background immune suppressant withdraw entry . They elect receive total 320 mg depomedrol ( two injection ) screen visit visit 2 month dose begin . Abatacept ( 125 mg ) placebo administer weekly subcutaneous dos . After 3 month treatment patient respond may elect receive open label abatacept without additional standard care therapy . Such patient consider non responder . The primary endpoint British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index ( BILAG ) -linked Combined Lupus Assessment ( BICLA ) require clinically significant improvement arthritis active feature lupus</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis : Abatacept effective lupus arthritis discernible small trial robust endpoint incorporate withdrawal background immune suppressant Study Schematic : Abatacept 125 mg placebo give 1:1 randomization subcutaneously week six month . All patient may elect continue six month open label Abatacept . Background Immune Suppressants withdrawn time screen first dose visit . At screening , patient may elect 40-160 mg depomedrol shot prn exceed 320 mg total include Month 2 Visit ( two month first dose visit ) After , additional steroid immune suppressant , necessary , allow patient consider non-responder primary endpoint six month basis . At 3 month visit patient significant clinical flare may also elect receive open label Abatacept consider non-responders primary endpoint six month . Primary Objective : To compare response rate Abatacept-Treated Placebo-Treated Patients active lupus arthritis trial design background immune suppressant withdrawal , limited steroid rescue , robust , discriminatory endpoint . The trial design primary endpoint response BICLA ( define ) pre-tested u safety ability ensure placebo group non-response , underscore power study . This support rational decision development abatacept SLE minimal cost . Secondary clinical outcome measure use endpoint include : SRI 4/5 , change joint count , SLEDAI , BILAG , CLASI , PGA , LFA REAL measure . The definition clinical outcome measure follow : BICLA : BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment , This defined British Isles Lupus Assessment Group ( BILAG ) index score severe entry ( BILAG A score ) improve moderate ( BILAG B ) level ( well ) feature moderate entry improve mild level ( BILAG C score ) resolve ( BILAG D score ) without increase BILAG feature SLEDAI scoring ( see SLEDAI definition ) , well 10 % worsen Physician 's Global Assessment additional treatment protocolized baseline rescue ( e.g . new SLE treatment two month visit ) . SLEDAI stand Systemic Lupus Erythematosis Disease Activity Index . SRI 4/5 define SLEDAI improvement least 4 point ( 5 point respectively ) , increase BILAG-measured disease activity 10 % worsen Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) . CLASI stand Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area Severity Index . PGA stand Physician 's Global Assessment . LFA REAL stand Lupus Foundation America Rapid Evaluation Activity Lupus . This instrument pilot phase test ABC study . PK immunogenicity study also perform help interpretation outcome . Novel biologic discovery integrate clinical trial support pre-specified exploratory biomarker discovery . Data generate might use help select appropriate patient subset future trial , along PK data , help guide optimal dose strategy . Optimizing patient selection dose important goal increase demonstrable effect size trial increase response rate treatment group . This study perform double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial 1:1 randomization patient abatacept 125 mg weekly subcutaneous dose placebo , withdrawal background immune suppressant . Limited steroid rescue allow screening visit Month 2 visit per protocol . Additional standard care rescue medication may use need define non-response primary endpoint date six month . Flaring patient may elect receive open label abatacept Month 3 also define non-responders primary endpoint . All patient may elect receive open label abatacept additional six month primary endpoint date , two follow visit ( 2 4 month post medication withdrawal ) ass withdrawal effect complete safety assessment . Accrual Goal : This study continue recruit achieve goal 60 patient complete study visit 6 month endpoint . Correlative Studies : Extensive exploratory protocol-specific ancillary immune pharmacodynamic study , focus first change IFN alpha , BLyS B Cell pathways . A major focus also T Cell pathways focus T suppressor/TH17 dichotomy treatment abatacept . A responder analysis perform order generate hypothesis useful select appropriate patient treatment optimize dose strategy . Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events Adverse Events special interest ( infusion reaction infection ) collect describe . Stopping Rules : Patients may withdraw investigator non-compliance safety . All patient terminate six month consider non responder primary analysis . Use protocol immune suppressant necessarily dictate withdrawal determine non-responder status . A DSMB board least two physician ( four currently participate ) review data may stop study need .</detailed_description>
