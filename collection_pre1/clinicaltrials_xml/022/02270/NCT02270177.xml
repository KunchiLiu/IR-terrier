To knowledge , previous study investigate whether headache consultation telemedicine provide equal health care outcome compare regular visit neurologist . If 's case , modern interactive health care system may give simpler cheap service patient , save travel cost community expense .

We gather primary secondary endpoint recruit participant questionnaire send three 12 month consultation . In addition , go investigate quality physician ` referral , people ` use medication , alternative therapy well calculation cost saving use telemedicine . The patient ' informed consent always obtain data collection . Patients able withdraw study time . Withdrawal affect treatment follow .
