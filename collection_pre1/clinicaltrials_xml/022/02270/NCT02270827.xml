	<brief_summary>This study focus severe asthmatic asthma symptom . 40 % asthma patient continue experience symptom 5 % difficult-to-control asthma despite continually improve treatment . Severe asthmatic experience clinically-significant bad health-related quality life less severe asthma . Poorer health-related quality life consequence frequent , severe symptom , prevent patient continue normal , active lifestyle . The Royal Brompton Hospital use treatment regimen intravenous ( IV ) Aminophylline IV Hydrocortisone appear improve symptom reduce exacerbation . At present anecdotal evidence support assumption . The objective study determine whether objective evidence improvement , particular look lung function , symptom cardiovascular function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Into Health Pre Post Treatment With Intravenous Aminophylline Hydrocortisone Severe Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant involve project approximately 3 - 4 week , depend long usually come hospital , clinical treatment . For 1 week wear physical activity monitor first course Aminophylline Hydrocortisone , treatment , 1 week post treatment . This monitor record active participant small monitor worn upper arm . Both study visit happen patient already hospital , admission discharge take approximately 2-3 hour complete . Both study visit include : â€¢ 3 type breathe test : Impulse oscillometry asthma laboratory , mean breath mouth piece comfortable , steady rate . Exhaled nitric oxide measure gas produce cell lung . This comfortable , steady blow handheld machine . Spirometry involve fill lung blow hard machine . - A blood test - Full Blood Count ( FBC ) include eosinophil , glucose , fibrinogen , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , total Immunoglobulin-E ( IgE ) , citrate coagulation platelet aggregation . - 3 short questionnaire ask symptom , control asthma , patient feel asthma affect . - A 6 Minute Walk Test involve walk ward corridor 6 minute see distance cover 6 minute . - Cardiovascular test : Arterial stiffness series blood pressure leg , arm neck . Some test perform part usual hospital care . These include blood test , 6 Minute Walk Test , spirometry . Blood sample do routinely part normal care . Blood collect clinical blood test administration IV Aminophylline IV Hydrocortisone final dose . The clinical trial observe patient clinical treatment . All decision regard treatment dose duration make clinical team . All sample go standard accredit hospital routine laboratory trial site . No sample store , move site leave UK .</detailed_description>
