	<brief_summary>The primary aim study evaluate consequence frailty critically ill patient . We hypothesize high frailty index ( base publish questionnaire ) predict long surgical intensive care unit hospital length stay , less ventilator-free day higher likelihood adverse discharge disposition . Our secondary aim identify muscle-size derived variable use predict frailty . We hypothesize low skeletal muscle mass measure ultrasound use quantify frailty , also predict outcome SICU patient , express longer stay surgical intensive care unit longer stay hospital , less ventilator-free day higher likelihood adverse discharge disposition . Our third aim examine potential trigger muscle waste critically ill patient . Muscle waste assessed repetitive ultrasound measurement muscle mass . We hypothesize significant decrease skeletal muscle mass predict long stay surgical intensive care unit longer hospital length stay , less ventilator-free day adverse discharge disposition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Frailty define status decreased physiological reserve lead high vulnerability stressor . It associate high risk morbidity mortality . Within geriatric population , frailty common know predictor adverse outcome . The usefulness frailty assessment outcome measure critically ill patient age need evaluate . This study evaluate whether frailty effect outcome critically ill patient . Muscle weakness predict outcome ICU patient hard determine ICU since measurement volition dependent . Muscle mass correlate muscle weakness assess objectively . This study evaluate consequence reduce muscle mass sarcopenia outcome critically ill patient . In addition , muscle waste ICU may predict persistent functional disability . This study aim examine muscle waste critically ill patient surgical ICU .</detailed_description>
