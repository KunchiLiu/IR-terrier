	<brief_summary>The investigator recently develop innovative optical molecular image platform ( call PRODIGI ) base high-resolution fluorescence white-light technology hand-held , real-time , high-resolution , non-invasive format . PRODIGI offer non-contact mean obtain instantaneous image-based measurement diagnostically-relevant biological molecular information wound surround skin tissue first time could significant impact improve conventional wound care , management , guidance intervention . In preliminary preclinical testing , investigator discover wound illuminated violet/blue light , endogenous collagen connective tissue matrix emit characteristic green fluorescent signal , pathogenic bacterial specie emit unique red fluorescence signal due production endogenous porphyrin . Therefore , autofluorescence imaging , exogenous contrast agent need imaging , make approach particularly appeal diagnostic imaging method clinical use . In context study , PRODIGI use ass wound complication patient diagnose soft tissue sarcoma treat pre-operative radiotherapy . Both pre- postoperative external beam radiotherapy combine limb salvage surgery similarly high rate local control management extremity soft tissue sarcoma . The main acute side effect associate preoperative radiotherapy wound heal complication . Wound care overall major clinical challenge present enormous burden health care worldwide . The objective clinical study determine PRODIGI couple optical tracking platform clinical utility identifying , quantitatively measure longitudinally track bacterial imbalance patient 's intact skin surface location surgical resection site adult patient low limb soft tissue sarcoma treat preoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy limb salvage surgery , , investigate whether bacterial imbalance relate radiotherapy dose wound complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical Tracking System For study , PRODIGI combine commercial optical track system ( OTS , Polaris , NDI Medical , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada ) track movement device space relative patient time . This addition form infrared-light camera , track four IR reflective sphere ( NDI Medical , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada ) fix external housing PRODIGI device . The OTS describe previously . Briefly , consist optical track technology , provide 6 degree freedom ( x , , z , pitch . yaw , roll ) , attach camera along software develop house register visualize track camera pose relative previously acquire radiological volumetric image data . The in-house software platform GTxEyes performs track navigation image camera , camera calibration ( include image distortion ) , registration camera coordinate respect CT image , co-visualization ( e.g . visual overlay ) camera CT image . Radiation dose plan information also spatially co-registered overlaid hybrid optical-CT images/videos use method describe previously group . After load CT image patient , OTS register CT coordinate space identification know fiducials use conventional pointer tool . With registration complete , coordinate PRODIGI camera track real time relative CT image . Viewing option include orthogonal view CT image , correct PRODIGI image virtual image base CT surface render view perspective virtual camera PRODIGI coordinate . Radiation dose displayed real virtual camera view either isodose line colorwash . Patient Population Patients recruit Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University Health Network ( Ontario , Canada ) sarcoma clinic treat pre-operative external beam RT follow surgical resection lower limb soft-tissue sarcoma . Informed consent obtain accord institutional Research Ethics Board ( REB ) requirement Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02270086 ) . Patients pre-existing skin issue , receive prior radiotherapy require chemotherapy eligible study . Imaging Procedures At radiotherapy planning stage , CT scan patient sarcoma site acquire standard treatment planning purpose . Prior CT scan , small radio-opaque fiduciary marker ( Suremark TM skin mark label ) place patient 's six radiation treatment setup point , make &lt; 1 mm diameter point easy identify CT image . After CT scan , marker replace ink tattoo use radiation treatment align patient radiation therapy machine reference frame . In addition CT fiducial marker place treatment setup point , flexible radio-opaque wire overlaid plan surgical incision . This enabled localization entire surgical scar radiation treatment plan procedure . A radiotherapy stereotactic mask also make stage . Following CT simulation scan acquisition , appropriate radiotherapy plan design per institutional clinical standard guideline . Imaging PRODIGI OTS perform throughout sarcoma management , i.e . radiotherapy operating room . Imaging perform three time point RT : fraction 0 , 12 25 , i.e . beginning , middle end treatment . Four six treatment setup point mark radio-opaque fiduciary marker CT scan use perform optical CT co-registration . An optically-tracked pointer tool use four IR reflective sphere ( identical one fix PRODIGI system ) use register patient space respect IR camera . For , pointer place sequentially tattoo mark , identify spatially registered track IR camera visualize real-time CT scan use custom-built software GTxEyes . The location tattoo point optical track coordinate system register correspond point CT image use fiduciary CT marker . Once registration complete , plan surgical scar drawn patient 's skin marker superimpose optically-tracked pointer scar visible CT scan . An imaging session consist WL correspond AF imaging plan skin surgical incision surround tissue . Room light turn AF image avoid background signal artifact . The four reflective sphere PRODIGI device point towards IR camera ensure proper track 3D entire session . To perform PRODIGI image operating room , sterilization method approve UHN 's control processing department use sterile drape find effective way ensure proper sterile condition without damage instrument affect performance . An elongated sterile drape ( Cardinal Health Canada , 29-59029 ) use cover entire PRODIGI imaging system , i.e . camera electrical power cord . Six strong neodymium magnet ( Super Magnets , 8 mm diameter ) embed emission filter slider six correspond magnet autoclave prior use place outside drape hold place avoid image quality degradation . Steri-strips ( 3M , R1547 ) apply outside draped device tighten drape around IR reflective sphere insure adequate tracking imaging . Imaging perform five time point : sterilization surgical site ( OR1 , OR2 ) , flap raise ( OR3 ) , tumor excision ( OR4 ) closure ( OR5 ) . The combined WL AF image part superset data record use track system . The superset also include preoperative patient CT patient 's RT dose volume . A skin surface model generate patient 's CT , surface point hold quantitative tuple contain surface normal vector , RT dose , WL scalar , AF scalar , camera pose correspond AF scalar . Overlay WL AF image skin surface model visualize use software ParaView .</detailed_description>
