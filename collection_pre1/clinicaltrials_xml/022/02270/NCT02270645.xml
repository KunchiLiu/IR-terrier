	<brief_title>Randomized Pilot Study Treatment BCC Using Multiplex 595/1064 nm Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma malignancy significant prevalence rarely metastasize locally destructive . Laser therapy type lesion may superior option patient wish tolerate modality topical chemotherapeutics surgery . In pilot study , preliminarily assess efficacy safety 595/1064 nm Multiplex laser treat superficial nodular basal cell carcinoma le 1.5 cm size . Eligible patient biopsy-proven superficial nodular BCCs le 1.5 cm size opportunity enroll study . This unblinded study patient randomize either treatment arm control arm . Patients treatment arm receive three treatment 595/1064 nm multiplex laser space four week apart . In addition assess presence adverse effect , photograph take visit . One month last treatment session , patient group return evaluation 1 ) clinical clearance 2 ) histological clearance BCC . In order ass clinical clearance , dermatologist grossly examine , measure , document residual lesion . Afterwards , deep excisional biopsy encompass entire region take histological clearance determine microscopic examination residual tumor cell . Follow-up wound care biopsy occur one week later . Tumor burden calculate change surface area lesion . After standard diagnostic biopsy , patient control arm follow three regular visit , space 4 week apart . One month third follow-up visit , control patient return final photography evaluation clinical histological clearance , treatment arm . Although extremely rare1 , clinical sign progression visible period ( consider great 10 % growth ) , patient withdrawn study undergo standard care treatment .</detailed_description>
