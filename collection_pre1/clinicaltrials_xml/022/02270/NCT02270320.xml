	<brief_summary>Background : Promotion cognitive function middle age old adult prevention dementia important issue age society . In recent year , study show Tai Chi Chuan ( TCC ) exercise improve cognitive function healthy middle-aged older adult , study investigate neural mechanism . Therefore , purpose research project : ( 1 ) investigate effect TCC exercise intervention improve cognitive function motor function healthy middle-aged older adult ; ( 2 ) investigate effect TCC intervention improve integrity frontostriatal fiber tract , area intensity brain activation perform switch task healthy middle-aged older adult . Methods : This project use assessor-blind randomized control clinical trial design . A total 60 healthy middle-aged older adult recruit , randomly allocate two group : experimental control group . Experimental group receive 60-minute exercise program , three time per week 12 week . Control group receive telephone consultation every two week 12 week . All participant receive clinical neuropsychological test , Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery test , motor function test , diffusion spectrum MR imaging , functional MRI experiment intervention , end intervention realize change cognitive function , motor function , integrity neural tract , intensity region functional activation switch task executive function order understand cognitive effect neural mechanism TCC .</brief_summary>
