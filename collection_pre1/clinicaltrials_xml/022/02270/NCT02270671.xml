	<brief_summary>Attention bias modification training ( ABMT ) computer-based attention training programme design modify way person 's attention direct mild threat environment . What person focus attention play important role safe unsafe feel certain situation . Much research show people high level anxiety tend focus attention negative information surroundings . The purpose ABMT set place attention pattern lead excessive anxiety . The present study test whether treatment effective reduce social anxiety 15-18 year old school setting . The study design consist two phase . During Phase 1 participant complete screen questionnaire relation wellbeing emotion . This questionnaire include measure affective , cognitive , behavioural component social anxiety adolescence . Depending suitability ( i.e . score cut-off standardised measure social anxiety Phase 1 study ) , participant may invite take part 4-week computer-based attention training programme . The purpose phase see ABMT help young people feel less worried nervous social situation teach focus environment differently . Previous research contain attention training task similar train programme suggest attention training reduce symptom social anxiety adolescent . Individuals invite take part train session randomly assign either intervention placebo ( inactive ) group . Both group ask complete 4-week programme involve one computer training session per week ( session take approximately 15-20 minute ) . Questionnaires also give participant complete intervention , along 12-week follow assessment . These include questionnaire measure social anxiety , depressive symptom , fear relation negative evaluation . Each questionnaire take approximately 40 minute complete . Participants know whether receive intervention placebo train intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) among prevalent mental disorder adolescence ( Merikangas et al. , 2010 ) , 10 % female 5 % male diagnose SAD adolescence ( Wittchen &amp; Fehm , 2003 ) . SAD characterise mark fear anxiety social situation individual expose possible scrutiny others ( APA , 2013 ) . SAD associate social isolation , poor social skill , low self-esteem , future comorbid mental disorder ( Wittchen et al. , 2000 ) . Social anxiety typically develop adolescence , thus need detect treat early prior development clinically-diagnosed SAD . Most early intervention social anxiety use Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) , focus modify explicit verbal cognition ( Neil &amp; Christensen , 2009 ) . However , many adolescent access CBT many find demand ( Otto et al. , 2004 ) . Recently , researcher develop novel treatment , Attention Bias Modification ( ABM ) , aim modify implicit cognitive bias ( MacLeod , 2012 ) . ABM base cognitive theory , propose individual anxiety automatically attend threat-related information environment , bias towards negative information . In support theory , research demonstrate relationship attention anxiety ( Mathews &amp; MacLeod , 2002 ) , relationship appear causal ( Mogg &amp; Bradley , 1998 ) . Evidence indicate social anxiety reduce ABM procedure clinical ( Amir et al. , 2008 ) non-clinical population ( Klump &amp; Amir , 2009 ) . However , little ABM research conduct adolescent ( Sportel et al. , 2013 ) . Beard et al . ( 2011 ) note ABM study follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials guideline , register clinical trial ( Emmelkamp , 2012 ) . The Present Study : This research test efficacy ABM training reduce social anxiety adolescent . Given age onset social anxiety adolescence , peak late teen ( Merikangas et al. , 2010 ) , research focus 15-18 year old . Given publish study specifically consider role gender impact ABM training , research build gender design , thus research line best practice ( EU Commission , 2011 ) . Aims &amp; Objectives : 1 . To test efficacy ABM training reduce social anxiety adolescent 2 . To examine impact gender efficacy ABM training reduce social anxiety Central Research Questions : 1 . Is ABM training associate : I . A decrease threat-related attentional bias ? II . A decrease negative evaluation ? III . A decrease social anxiety ? IV . A decrease test anxiety ? 2 . Does gender impact efficacy ABM reduce social anxiety ? PHASE 1 : PRE-SCREEN FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY IN ADOLESCENTS Objective : To screen sub-clinical level social anxiety adolescent . School Sampling : 4-8 large second-level school Dublin randomly select Department Education Skills 2012 publish list school . Schools gender-mixed match school size , disadvantaged/non-disadvantaged status , geographical location . Power Analysis : Using G*Power 3.1 , sample size determine 80 base follow parameter : medium effect size 0.3 , alpha 0.05 , power 0.8 , repeat measure within-between interaction : 2 ( Randomization ) X 2 ( Gender ) X 3 ( Pre , Post , Follow-up ) . To account attrition rate , sample 100 participant recruit . Participants : Adolescents age 15-18 year Senior Cycle invite initial screening . Procedure : Adolescents must return parental informed consent form . Participants screen use Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory Children ( SPAI-C , Beidel et al. , 1998 ) . Participants score cut-off social anxiety SPAI-C invited participate intervention ( Phase 2 ) . Approximately , 1500 Senior Cycle student across 8 school invite complete pre-screen Phase 1 . With approximate response rate 50 % ( N=500 ) , use 25 % top centile sample 125 identify . Because anticipated drop-out , investigator randomly select 100 adolescent intervention ( 50 per condition ) . PHASE 2 : RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL Objective : To compare efficacy ABM placebo train reduce social anxiety . Participants : Adolescents Phase 1 screen cut-off invited participate intervention randomly assign ABM/placebo training . On basis pre-screening Phase 1 , PI ensure group equivalence across ABM versus placebo group key variable ( e.g. , age , gender , social anxiety ) advance randomisation . Post randomisation , independent variable check ensure balance across group contaminate outcome study . Procedure : ABM Placebo Protocols Participants ABM training placebo group receive 4 training session 4-week period . The intervention perform laptop school deliver quiet room researcher present . Pre-test occur prior intervention , post-test 4 week , follow follow-up assessment 12 week . The Dot-Probe Attention Task The dot-probe task form basis threat bias assessment attention bias modification . In dot-probe task , pair face ( stimulus ) , one threat-related ( angry face ) one neutral ( neutral face ) present different location computer screen time trial . Each trial begin presentation fixation display ( 500ms ; white cross centre screen ) , participant request focus gaze . The fixation display follow face pair display ( 500ms ) . Immediately follow face pair display , target-probe appear . The target-probe consist arrowhead point either leave right ( `` &lt; `` `` &gt; '' ) , appear location previously occupy one face . Participants require determine symbol appear press one two pre-specified button mouse . Participants require respond quickly possible target-probe without compromise accuracy . Response latencies task provide 'snap-shot ' distribution participant 's attention , fast response target-probes present attended location relative unattended location . Attention bias threat evident participant faster respond target-probes replace threat-related stimulus rather neutral stimulus . A new trial begin follow inter-trial interval ( 500ms ) . The computer training require E-Prime 2 software ( PST , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Cue stimuli face photograph 20 different individual ( 10 male , 10 female ) NimStim stimulus set ( Tottenham , et al. , 2009 ) . Two different picture individual select , depict angry neutral expression . Participants present pair face actor ( neutral face-angry face neutral face-neutral face ) screen trial . ABM Training The ABM protocol consist 160 trial ( 120 angry-neutral face pair presentation 40 neutral-neutral face pair presentation ) . In ABM condition , target-probe appear neutral-face location angry-neutral trial . A short break deliver every 40 trial ( 1 block ) . An accuracy 70 % block necessary continue training . The task take 7 minute . Placebo Training The placebo protocol consist 160 trial ( 120 angry-neutral face pair 40 neutral-neutral face pair presentation ) . In condition , angry-face location , probe location actor fully counterbalance presentation . A short break deliver every 40 trial ( 1 block ) . An accuracy 70 % block necessary continue training . The task take 7 minute . Outcome Measures : Outcome measure administer participant RCT pre-intervention ( baseline ) , post-intervention ( week 4 ) , 12-week follow-up , include : Threat Bias Measurement The threat bias measurement protocol consist 120 trial ( 80 angry-neutral 40 neutral-neutral presentation ) . Angry-face location , probe location , probe type , actor fully counterbalance presentation . The participant must perform 70 % accuracy first 10 trial . The task take 5 minute . Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory Children ( SPAI-C ) The SPAI-C ( Beidel et al. , 1998 ) 26-item self-report instrument good psychometric property adolescent sample ( Inderbitzen-Nolan et al. , 2004 ) . The SPAI-C measure somatic , cognitive behavioural aspect social phobia child adolescent . Questions relate nervous respondent feel carry certain task response rat 3-point scale never , hardly ever time , always high score indicate great level social anxiety . In present study , participant score cut-off SPAI-C Phase 1 study invite take part Phase 2 study . Brief Fear Negative Evaluations Scale II ( BFNE-II ) Negative evaluation important aspect social anxiety . The BFNE ( Carleton et al. , 2006 ) 12-item measure assess fear negative evaluation . Items respond 5-point Likert scale 0 4 . The BFNE-II show high internal consistency correlate well original BFNE ( Carleton et al. , 2006 ) . Screen Child Anxiety Related Disorders ( SCARED ) Child Version The SCARED develop Birmaher et al . ( 1999 ) use screen sign anxiety disorder . The 41-item measure use measure anxiety , include panic , separation anxiety , generalise anxiety , social avoidance school phobia . It show high reliability adolescent ( Birmaher et al. , 1999 ) . Items rat 3-point Likert scale . Internal consistency show high adolescent sample ( Crocetti et al. , 2009 ) . Depression Subscale Revised Child Anxiety Depression Scale ( RCADS ) The RCADS ( Chorpita et al. , 2000 ) 47-item self-report measure good psychometric property adolescent sample ( Mathyssek et al. , 2013 ) The Depression Subscale contain 10 item use research . Items relate frequency depressive symptom experience rat 4-point Likert scale never always . Research Design : A mixed model 2 ( Randomisation ) x2 ( Gender ) x3 ( Time test ) complex design combine subject within subject employ . Each participant test pre-intervention , post-intervention , follow-up . Independent Variables : Randomisation ( K=2 ; ABM/ Placebo ) Gender ( K=2 ) Time test ( K=3 ; Pre-intervention [ baseline ] , Post-intervention [ week 4 ] , Follow-up ) Analyses : All analysis change social anxiety , anxiety , depression , fear negative evaluation conduct intention-to-treat analysis . 1 . Descriptive statistic 2 . Chi-square analysis ANOVAs 3 . Primary analysis consist three-way repeat ANOVAs 2 ( Randomisation ) x2 ( Gender ) x3 ( Time test ) test variable study .</detailed_description>
