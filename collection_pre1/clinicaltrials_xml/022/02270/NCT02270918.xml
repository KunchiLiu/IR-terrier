	<brief_summary>Apixaban anticoagulant ( also know blood thinner ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) reduce risk stroke systemic embolism patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation . It reliable method reversal . Kcentra FDA approve drug derive blood use antidote treat people bleed associate take well-known anticoagulant warfarin . This Phase I , placebo-controlled , single site , open-label , crossover trial evaluate reversibility apixaban anticoagulation Kcentra .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversibility Apixaban Anticoagulation With Four Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Kcentra</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral anticoagulant effective treatment prevention venous arterial thrombotic event . For 50 year class anticoagulant available vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) , warfarin , require frequent blood work monitoring . Apixaban new approve anticoagulant use treat patient blood clot risk develop blood clot . Unlike warfarin , use apixaban require frequent blood work monitoring associate lower bleeding risk . All anticoagulation therapy associate spontaneous provoke bleed risk reversal blood thin effect might need . Reversal anticoagulation may also need case emergent urgent surgery indicate . There currently available reversal agent apixaban . Prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) contain clot factor replace factor inhibited anticoagulant . In recent study Netherlands four factor prothrombin complex concentrate , Cofact ( available USA ) show able reverse anticoagulation effect another factor Xa inhibitor , rivaroxaban . Kcentra four factor prothrombin complex concentrate FDA approve 2013 used antidote treat people bleed associate take warfarin . It contain clot factor II , VII , IX X derive donate blood could effective reverse anticoagulation effect factor Xa inhibitor , apixaban . No effective reversal agent apixaban exists . Physicians struggle bleeding patient apixaban . Indeed , uncommon problem patient suffer brain bleeds trauma . This study could potentially identify Kcentra reversal agent patient take apixaban . This study test hypothesis Kcentra potential significantly reduce anticoagulation effect apixaban measure thrombin generation assay 30 minute post infusion Kcentra compare placebo infusion subject dose steady state apixaban .</detailed_description>
