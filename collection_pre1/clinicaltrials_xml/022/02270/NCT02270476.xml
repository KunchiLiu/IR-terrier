	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common lethal genetic multisystem disease Germany . Although life expectancy increase last decade , CF patient die young adulthood due chronic CF lung disease respiratory failure . CF lung disease cause disturbed transport salt water airway epithelia dehydration airway surface result underlying genetic defect Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) gen. Up , causal therapy majority patient CF available . Little known onset natural course well influence factor CF lung disease . Therefore , first aim prospective , multicenter , uncontrolled , non-randomized , explorative longitudinal study characterization onset early course CF lung disease . For reason primarily include patient diagnosed CF newborn screening ( CF-NBS ) reason first four month life ( early diagnose , ED ) . In second step compare data patient diagnose clinically late life ( late diagnose , LD ) . This allow u investigate effect early diagnosis start therapy . Starting diagnosis , use data annual routine check-ups ( image like chest MRI , pulmonary function test , microbiology swab sputum , laboratory value , anthropometry ) well data facultative , study-related bronchoscopy lavage ( microbiology , inflammation immunology ) correlation course CF lung disease ( generation hypothesis ) . Further study-related investigation monthly telephone interview bronchopulmonary symptom study nurse basis questionnaire quarterly assessment health-related quality life basis validate questionnaire . We expect gain deep insight onset early course CF lung disease result study . So far , trial investigate different aspect CF lung disease ( function , morphology , infectiology , inflammation ) complementary longitudinal setting . We assume knowledge natural history CF lung disease vulnerable phase early childhood great impact future development new therapy ( symptomatic causal ) . This shall lead improvement life expectancy quality life patient CF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Newly diagnose patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . Diagnosis CF : least one follow three international accept criterion fulfil : ) sweat chloride â‰¥ 60mEq/L and/or ii ) 2 CFcausing mutation CFTR gene and/or iii ) change typical CF transepithelial potential difference nasal rectal epithelium . 2 . Age mode diagnosis : Early diagnose ( ED ) : Initial diagnosis follow CFNBS reason first 4 month life ( preterms correct age 4 month ) January 1st , 2006 . Other reason could prenatal diagnostics , meconium ileus positive family history . Late diagnose ( LD ) : Diagnosed fourth month life due clinical symptom ; initial diagnosis January 1st , 2006 . All patient exclude whose parent want participate withdraw study ; diagnosis CF unsure . Further exclusion criterion : 1 . Preterms &lt; 30th week gestation 2 . Longer period mechanical ventilation first 3 month life 3 . A significant medical disease condition CF likely interfere child 's ability complete entire protocol 4 . Previous major surgery except meconium ileus atresia intestine 5 . Other major organ dysfunction , exclude pancreatic hepatic dysfunction another condition due CF 6 . Physical finding would compromise safety subject quality study data determine investigator 7 . Chronic lung disease CF ( e.g . bronchopulmonary dysplasia ) 8 . History adverse reaction medication sedation know claustrophobia Criteria , lead displacement procedure sedation child recover : Clinically significant upper airway obstruction determine investigator ( e.g . severe laryngomalacia , markedly enlarge tonsil , significant snoring , diagnose obstructive sleep apnoea ) Severe gastroesophageal reflux , define persistent frequent emesis despite antireflux therapy</criteria>
