	<brief_summary>Background Functional community ambulation require critical level postural control walk skill , also ability engage cognitive task walk ( i.e. , dual-task walking ) adapt constantly-changing environmental context . There evidence show dual-task balance gait performance significantly impaired stroke . Increasing evidence also suggest dual-task balance gait performance useful predict fall among individual stroke . Considering high clinical relevance dual-task balance gait performance , essential stroke rehabilitation adequately address dual-task deficit . Developing specific dual-task balance gait train enhance dual-task performance thus necessary promote community ambulation reintegration . Study Aim The aim Introduction Many individual stroke continue cope residual physical impairment discharge hospital . One major problem encounter people stroke community reintegration . Functional community ambulation require critical level postural control walk skill , also ability engage cognitive task walk ( i.e. , dual-task walking ) adapt constantly-changing environmental context . There increase awareness importance dual-task gait performance community-dwelling individual stroke past year . There evidence show dual-task balance gait performance significantly impaired stroke . Increasing evidence also suggest dual-task balance gait performance useful predict fall among individual stroke . Considering high clinical relevance dual-task balance gait performance , essential stroke rehabilitation adequately address dual-task deficit . Developing specific dual-task balance gait train enhance dual-task performance thus necessary promote community ambulation reintegration . Study Aim This single-blinded randomized control trial ( RCT ) .The aim study examine efficacy dual-task exercise program cognitive-motor interference balance walk task , balance self-efficacy , participation everyday activity , community reintegration incidence fall among individual chronic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Many individual stroke continue cope residual physical impairment discharge hospital . One major problem encounter people stroke community reintegration . Functional community ambulation require critical level postural control walk skill , also ability engage cognitive task walk ( i.e. , dual-task walking ) adapt constantly-changing environmental context . There increase awareness importance dual-task gait performance community-dwelling individual stroke past year . There evidence show dual-task balance gait performance significantly impaired stroke . Increasing evidence also suggest dual-task balance gait performance useful predict fall among individual stroke . Considering high clinical relevance dual-task balance gait performance , essential stroke rehabilitation adequately address dual-task deficit . Developing specific dual-task balance gait train enhance dual-task performance thus necessary promote community ambulation reintegration . Study Aim The aim study examine efficacy dual-task exercise program cognitive-motor interference balance walk task , balance self-efficacy , participation everyday activity , community reintegration incidence fall among individual chronic stroke . Study design This single-blinded randomized control trial ( RCT ) . After baseline evaluation , subject randomly allocate one three group : ( 1 ) dual-task training group , ( 2 ) single-task training group , ( 3 ) strengthen flexibility exercise group ( control ) , use 1:1:1 randomization sequence . Measurements Outcomes use compare therapeutic effect 3 treatment group . The outcome measurement ( except data incidence fall ) take place 3 time point : ( 1 ) within one week initiation intervention ( baseline ) , ( 2 ) within one week completion training , ( 3 ) 8 week completion training . The fall data collect monthly basis 6 month termination intervention period . All assessment perform researcher blind group allocation .</detailed_description>
