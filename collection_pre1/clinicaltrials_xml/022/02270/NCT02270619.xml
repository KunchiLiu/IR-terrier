	<brief_summary>Late-life depression major public health burden due high prevalence associate morbidity , suicide risk , functional decline , mortality . Unfortunately , current antidepressant therapy limit effectiveness ; hence , biologically plausible model new treatment pursue . Systemic inflammation hypothesize play important role onset perpetuation depression , especially old woman . Aging process involve heighten inflammatory state , inflammatory disorder depression prevalent woman men . However , increase systemic inflammation necessarily lead depression woman . Even robust systemic inflammation experimentally induce ( e.g . endotoxin administration ) , largely variable increase depressive symptom find . Defining factor account variability may identify individual risk develop depression expose heighten inflammatory state age , obesity , chronic disease , inform future translational study depression prevention . In particular , role sleep disturbance explain variability require attention independent risk factor depression heighten systemic inflammation increase production proinflammatory cytokine . The investigator also discover woman , men , report sleep disturbance include short sleep duration experience significantly depressive symptom response inflammatory challenge woman without sleep disturbance . Thus , hypothesize sleep loss vulnerability factor inflammation-induced depressive symptom woman . However , date , experimental approach use evaluate role sleep loss inflammation-induced depressive symptom . This proposal aim examine hypothesis partial sleep deprivation ( PSD ) follow endotoxin challenge old woman . It also aim explore genomic socio- emotional mechanism underlie association sleep loss depressive symptom . In randomized controlled factorial design , 80 healthy female volunteer age 60 69 randomly assign one 4 arm : 1 ) uninterrupted sleep follow placebo ; 2 ) uninterrupted sleep follow endotoxin ; 3 ) PSD follow placebo ; 4 ) PSD follow endotoxin . Subjects administer placebo endotoxin morning PSD uninterrupted sleep . Depressive symptom repeatedly assess 6 hour placebo endotoxin administration .</brief_summary>
