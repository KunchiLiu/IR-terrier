	<detailed_description>Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) procedure commonly use severe degeneration knee joint due osteoarthritis . With increase number TKA 's performed population age time amount healthcare dollar allot rehabilitation decline , need develop remote monitoring rehabilitation engage optimize self-management recovery . Current management TKA recovery typically perform out-patient setting highly protocol driven . A typical case might see physical therapist 2-3x/week 8-10 week perform specific exercise monitor progress ( i.e . compliance range motion ( ROM ) strengthen exercise ) . One recent study suggest variation patient ' independent exercise activity arthroplasty surgery may contribute variable functional gain . Telerehabilitation emerge method deliver healthcare . It likely become prevalent technology improve fund clinic appointment diminishes . Recent study show telerehabilitation effective conventional treatment , well tolerated patient healthcare professional . The StepRite system develop MedHab ( http : //www.medhab.com/ ) allow physical therapist monitor physical activity exercise remotely , thereby reduce need frequent out-patient visit . A thin insole place inside shoe measure foot contact pressure small device attach shoe measure acceleration . This information translate quantitative feedback exercise compliance performance measure compare surgical side non-surgical side . Real time feedback exercise weight-bearing activity provide patient , HIPAA secure user interface website also display information online dashboard physical therapist physician . Given potential improve patient engagement rehabilitation , study proposes treatment model include monitoring activity outside clinic use StepRite device use combination outpatient appointment remote consultation therapist . Hypothesis Patients use device post-surgery demonstrate superior short-term improvement ( i.e . 6 month post TKA ) respect self-reported functional outcome gait parameter , compare control group use device .</detailed_description>
