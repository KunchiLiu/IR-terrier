	<brief_summary>The main research question see Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation ( PTNS ) improve symptom tenesmus patient pelvic floor disorder .

The secondary research question see pelvic floor symptom quality life improve patient group level anxiety depression improve patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTNS Treatment Tenesmus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study discover PTNS use reduce symptom patient tenesmus due pelvic floor disorder . These pelvic floor disorder include rectal cancer situ , Anterior Resection Syndrome develop rectal-cancer treatment , gynaecological problem . Gynaecological problem cause tenesmus include radiotherapy gynaecological cancer , ovarian cyst , pelvic organ prolapse hysterectomy . Currently , lack treatment option available manage patient tenesmus hop PTNS provide simple , non-invasive treatment wide patient group distress symptom . Assessment symptom improvement use analyse change score COREFO , e-PAQ HADS questionnaire , complete pre post treatment . COREFO validate questionnaire include question specifically relate tenesmus . e-PAQ validated questionnaire look aspect pelvic floor ( bowel , urinary , vaginal , sexual ) along quality life . HADS validate questionnaire classify patient 's degree anxiety depression either `` normal '' , `` borderline abnormal '' `` abnormal '' . There two pilot study look effect PTNS improving symptom Anterior Resection Syndrome patient . However , full paper publish data . These two study assess symptom improvement use questionnaire , use COREFO , e-PAQ HADS , include patient currently rectal cancer ( i.e . Anterior Resection Syndrome patient ) gynaecological problem tenesmus symptom . Thus make research original proposal . e-PAQ widely use STH assess pelvic floor symptom , thus use enable comparison patient group also PTNS treatment option .</detailed_description>
