	<brief_summary>This study examine acute effect high intensity interval ergometry peripheral concentration lactate hydrogen ion , well cognitive function . Approximately 60 healthy , college-aged male participate Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ) , measure executive function , two time span two week . Prior WCST , participants complete either warm-up , warm-up high intensity interval exercise , stationary period . Changes lactate , pH , WCST score evaluate within group relation presence high intensity exercise stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental protocol perform three group . Two three group ( HIT1 HIT2 ) counterbalance one another , mean participant receive level treatment , treatment occur different sequence . The third group serve control ( CON ) . All qualified subject complete consent form receive detailed explanation experimental purpose procedure investigator . Subjects qualify participate study base upon result preliminary health history record , ACSM risk assessment , 7-day activity recall form IPAQ . Following consent , participant randomize one three group schedule three ( 3 ) lab session . A Subject Tracking Form use monitor progress subject . All three group begin study session protocol , constitute Day 1 ( Baseline ) . This session include baseline measurement perceive effort ( RPE ) , perceive pain ( RPP ) , affect ( FS ) . These measure take maximal oxygen uptake test schedule day . Two single 15 mL blood sample ( ~1 tablespoon ) drawn baseline pH lactate quantification . Blood draw ( BD ) repeat total 8 time throughout study total 120 mL blood . During two experimental session ( Session 2 Session 3 ) blood drawn 3 time ; prior HIT seat rest , immediately follow HIT seat rest , follow Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ) . The seventh eight blood draw occur baseline , immediately maximal oxygen uptake exercise test . Each group participate 8 blood draw . A demonstration WCST review Tabata high-intensity interval training protocol ( HIT ) also give session . Session 1 include cardiovascular fitness assessment ( relative VO2 test ) body fat assessment ( Bioelectrical Impedence Analysis , BIA ) . The following two session , Day 3 ( Session 2 ) Day 17 ( Session 3 ) , different group . The first group , ( HIT1 ) , complete warm-up , HIT , WCST Session 2 . The next session , Session 3 , schedule less 14 day Session 2 include warm-up , 5-minute stationary period , WCST . The second group , ( HIT2 ) , complete protocol HIT1 , complete Session 2 Session 3 reverse order . The control group ( CON ) perform warm-up HIT exercise either WCST . This group still 14-days separate WCST attempt . A follow-up email use report result WCST score participant subject complete study entirety . Instructions receive compensation participate study also provide follow-up . Data analyze use current version SPSS Statistics . A 2 ( HIT , HIT ) x 3 ( pre- , immediately post- , delayed post- HIT ) repeat measure ANOVA use determine affect HIT biophysiological function ( La , H+ , RPP , RPE , FS ) . A paired t-test show change executive function due HIT . A Pearson correlation determine influence biophysiological factor cognitive function 3 ( HIT1 , HIT2 , CON ) x 2 ( time WCST ) mixed-model ANOVA demonstrate learning effect associate WCST 14-day period .</detailed_description>
