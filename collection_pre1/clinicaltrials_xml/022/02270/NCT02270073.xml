It well establish cognitive behavior therapy last decade , investigated manualized group setting . Consequently , demand investigate mindfulness effectiveness condition trainee therapist highlight . Methods/Design : To fill research gap , investigator design PrOMET-Study . In study , investigator analyze effect brief , audio-tape present , in-session mindfulness intervention conduct trainee therapist patient begin individual therapy session randomize , control longitudinal design effectiveness condition total 30 trainee therapist 150 patient large outpatient training center . The investigator hypothesize mindfulness intervention positive effect therapeutic process outcome contrast progressive muscle relaxation treatment usual group . The investigator conduct multilevel modeling address nest data structure . Discussion : The study result could provide important practical implication , could inform idea improve clinical training psychotherapist could implement , need complex infrastructure additional time concern brief , in-session mindfulness intervention directly implement treatment session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Process Outcome Mindfulness Effects Trainees ( PrOMET ) -Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives.The main purpose study identify whether mindfulness exercise carry begin individual therapy session help improve therapeutic process . More specifically , investigator examine effect five minute in-session mindfulness intervention practice outpatient CBT trainee therapist begin 25 therapy session ( duration : 25 week ) process therapeutic change measure session questionnaire complete 25 session ( duration : 25 week ) clinical outcome assess every 10 week start baseline effectiveness condition . Thus , start therapeutic treatment , patient randomize either treatment usual + mindfulness intervention group ( TAU+M ) , control group practice short form PMR ( TAU+PMR ) , treatment usual ( TAU ) group . Before start intervention study , therapist participate six-week workshop-based mindfulness program . The investigator examine follow hypothesis : 1 . The investigator hypothesize patient therapist TAU+M experience high level therapeutic alliance , represent Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised ( WAI-SR ) , compare TAU+PMR TAU . 2 . The investigator hypothesize TAU+M , strong reduction clinical symptomatology patient compare TAU+PMR TAU . 1 . There strong reduction clinical symptomatology TAU+M versus TAU+PMR TAU first 25 session ( duration : 25 week ) , mindfulness exercise carry . 2 . This strong reduction clinical symptomatology remain stable follow-up . Methods/Design . The study randomize control trial three active treatment arm ( TAU+M , TAU+PMR TAU ) effectiveness conditions.It perform Center Psychological Psychotherapy ( CPP ) , large university outpatient-training center CBT University Heidelberg . Approximately 1000 patient per year different type psychiatric disorder ( two-thirds suffer anxiety depression ) treat approximately 100 trainee therapist . Patients therapists MIG perform together brief , five-minute mindfulness exercise begin 25 therapy session ( session perform weekly basis ) . Patients therapists CG perform together brief , five-minute version progressive muscle relaxation begin 25 therapy session . In TAU group , CPP standard psychotherapy procedure without intervention begin therapy session perform . Session-quality assessment perform 25 therapy session patient therapist perspective . Outcome assessment perform baseline , every ten session treatment , end therapy , 12-months follow-up . A detailed description outcome measure find `` Primary Secondary Outcome '' section . Participants . A total 30 trainee therapist 150 patient recruit CPP . The general inclusion criterion patient primary depressive anxiety disorder diagnosis Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) , German version . The investigator choose two disorder group patient treated German university therapy-training center ; approximately 40 % suffer primary major depression diagnose , approximately 30 % suffer primary anxiety disorder diagnose . Hence , investigator result importance majority outpatient diagnostic group . General exclusion criterion patient follow : ( 1 ) age 18 59 year , ( 2 ) insufficient German language skill , ( 3 ) suffer psychotic disorder . Other comorbidities consider limitation enter study . Power analyse G*Power clinical consideration result sample size 75 patient depression 75 patient anxiety disorder . Randomization . A total sample 150 patient assign one three group stratify randomization process . The randomization process perform five session diagnostic stage . Patients stratify one two category : one group main diagnosis major depression group main diagnosis anxiety disorder . Then , online randomization perform two independent research assistant . Mindfulness workshop training . In order prepare 30 trainee therapist in-session mindfulness intervention outline next section , investigator first offer two workshop separate six-week home-practice interval trainee therapist participate study . The workshop offer every year new group trainee therapists start outpatient therapy . The first workshop provide theoretical background mindfulness . In six-week interval workshops one two , participant practice formal informal mindfulness activity home . In second workshop , specifically address mindfulness experience participant suggestion improvement focus . Experimental Session.The experiment conduct university training center CPP . During five-minute mindfulness experimental task , patient therapist TAU+M sit distance one meter audio recorder . After initial greet ritual , patient therapist perform together brief mindfulness intervention first five minute therapy session . While perform exercise , patient therapist sit upright chair comfortable position , foot flat floor , arm legs uncrossed , hand rest lap . The mindfulness text standardize spoken Dr. Thomas Heidenreich , internationally renowned expert mindfulness research . During exercise , participant instruct observe body sensation , follow non-judgemental purposeful acknowledgement personal problem resource patient . After completion mindfulness intervention , regular therapy session begin . Following treatment session , patient therapist complete session questionnaire describe `` Primary Secondary Outcomes '' , require two minute . The TAU+PMR also receive five-minute audiotaped exercise basically condition ; specifically , receive short version PMR also speak Dr. Heidenreich . On one hand , PMR broadly accept easy implement relaxation exercise apply often control intervention investigate mindfulness intervention . On hand , include hypothesize specific effective ingredient mindfulness intervention ( mindful observation physiological psychological condition ) . The word control intervention similar experimental mindfulness intervention possible . The TAU conduct standard individual therapy session usual CPP . Recruitment patient therapist . Standard procedure CPP patient list wait list diagnostic screen phone call . After patient list wait list , contact study team receive verbal write information study . At begin every year , group trainee therapists CPP start outpatient therapy . Consequently , trainee receive begin every year verbal write information study . Trainees participate study participate two mindfulness workshop describe offer begin every year . The information give participant study include precise description inclusion exclusion criterion , information concern intervention questionnaire well data collection procedure . Further , emphasize study participation voluntary basis option revoke consent participate study time without cite reason suffer disadvantage . Moreover , participant opportunity instruct study team delete data without provide reason . Development feasibility intervention . The mindfulness exercise develop iterative process multiple step : First , Dr. Heidenreich Dr. Mander phrase preliminary version base breathe space exercise Michalak , Heidenreich Williams mindfulness center exercise Eifert Forsyth . Further , 10 therapist 10 patient conduct preliminary exercise one therapy session deliver feedback . After improve exercise accord patient therapist feedback , five mindfulness expert two expert psychotherapy process research review exercise offer feedback improvement . Based feedback process , final version mindfulness intervention developed.The feasibility brief in-session mindfulness intervention PMR intervention test pre-study 12 therapist 12 patient . Both patient therapist conduct exercise begin one therapy session CPP complete session questionnaire therapy session . Additionally , complete question scale 0 ( apply ) 4 ( applies fully ) concern feasibility intervention . The result indicate intervention could integrate without problem everyday therapeutic process , instruction understandable exercise generally positive impact therapy session . Statistical Analysis . The investigator apply multilevel model approach address nest data structure ( session level 1 nest within patient level 2 nest within therapist level 3 ) : Thereby , investigator treat time within-subject factor treatment condition between-subject factor . The investigator analyze main effect , , difference intercept TAU+M versus TAU+PMR versus TAU concern process outcome variable , interactive effect , , difference slop TAU+M versus TAU+PMR versus TAU concern process outcome variable . The investigator statistical hypothesis implies intercept significantly high TAU+M TAU+PMR TAU concern process outcome variable . Additionally , implies slope increase significantly strong TAU+M TAU+PMR TAU concern process outcome variable . The investigator conduct analyse intention-to-treat sample well completer sample . Further , patient therapists pre-treatment characteristic investigate outcome predictor level 2 3 control differential effect outcome three treatment arm .</detailed_description>
