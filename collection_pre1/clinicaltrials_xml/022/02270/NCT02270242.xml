	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare use ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor aspirin together . Both ticagrelor aspirin stop platelet stick together form blood clot could block blood flow heart . This study look determine effectiveness safety ticagrelor alone , compare ticagrelor plus aspirin reduce clinically relevant bleed reduce ischemic adverse event among high-risk patient percutaneous intervention least one drug-eluting stent . A patient consider high-risk meet certain clinical and/or anatomic criterion . Up 9000 subject enrol time index PCI . Subjects meet randomization eligibility criterion 3 month post enrollment randomize either ticagrelor plus aspirin ticagrelor plus placebo additional 12 month . Follow-up clinic visit perform 3 month , 9 month 15 month post enrollment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor With Aspirin Alone High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , blind dual-arm study . Up 9000 high-risk patient undergone successful elective urgent PCI least one locally approve drug elute stent discharge DAPT aspirin ticagrelor least 3 month intend duration center still determine U.S. , Canada , Europe Asia . The primary objective study determine impact antiplatelet monotherapy ticagrelor alone versus DAPT ticagrelor plus aspirin 12 month reduce clinically relevant bleeding ( efficacy ) among high-risk patient undergo PCI complete 3-month course aspirin plus ticagrelor . The secondary objective study determine impact antiplatelet monotherapy ticagrelor alone versus DAPT ticagrelor plus aspirin 12 month reduce major ischemic adverse event ( safety ) among high-risk patient undergo PCI complete 3-month course aspirin plus ticagrelor . Exploratory objective include assess comparative safety efficacy different DAPT regimens individual component primary efficacy secondary safety objective .</detailed_description>
