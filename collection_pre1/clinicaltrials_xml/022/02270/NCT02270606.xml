	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose fluorouracil give together radiation therapy follow combination chemotherapy surgery treat patient rectal cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving additional combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy fluorouracil follow combination chemotherapy surgery may better treatment rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy With 5-Fluorouracil Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study fluorouracil . CHEMORADIATION : Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day total 5 fraction concurrently receive fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) continuously 96 hour . PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY : Within 2 week complete chemoradiation , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV push follow IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Within 4-8 week complete preoperative chemotherapy , patient undergo total mesorectal excision . POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY : Within 4-8 week surgery , patient receive oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil preoperative chemotherapy . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year removal study death , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
