	<brief_summary>The objective non-therapeutic experiment develop method isolate inflammatory cell skin biopsy well method evaluate expression gene cell involve inflammation . It could eventually use well understand follow condition : atopic dermatitis , acne rosacea acne vulgaris . It also use good understand various medication work patient atopic dermatitis , acne rosacea acne vulgaris . Up 15 healthy volunteer , 15 subject atopic dermatitis , 15 subject acne rosacea 15 subject acne vulgaris select . For healthy volunteer subject atopic dermatitis , maximum four ( 4 ) skin biopsy ( 2-4 mm ) per subject take . For subject acne rosacea acne vulgaris , maximum two ( 2 ) skin biopsy ( 3 mm ) per subject collect . Biopsies perform either trunk limb , exclude hand foot . The biopsy use develop method isolate inflammatory cell skin . Various protocol test find best method . No medication give experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Innovaderm , collaboration `` The Immunoregulation laboratory CRCHUM '' `` McGill University division dermatology '' , recently develop novel 6-hour method study IL-17A ( Interleukin ) IL-22 fresh biopsy psoriatic patient . This reproducible experimental approach combine enzymatic digestion mechanical dissociation skin cell isolation . This follow multi-color flow cytometry analysis absence vitro expansion re-stimulation . Using method , examine cellular source IL-17A IL-22 small number ( 20x10Â³ ) viable CD45+ ( Cluster Differentiation Antigen 45 ) cell freshly isolate 4 mm punch skin biopsy ( n=22 patient psoriasis ) . The method use study `` Persistence IL-17A+ T lymphocytes IL-17A expression psoriatic plaque refractory ustekinumab therapy '' present 72nd annual meeting American Academy Dermatology Denver . A detailed presentation method do upcoming annual meeting Society Investigative Dermatology Albuquerque , New Mexico . We would like investigate adapt method dermatological condition Atopic Dermatitis , Acne Rosacea Acne Vulgaris .</detailed_description>
