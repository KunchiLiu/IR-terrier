	<brief_summary>The aim study : Main objective current study decrease sedentary behavior increase physical activity among mother offspring use music-to-movement video program . Primary outcome study objectively assess sedentary behavior physical activity time measure minute proportion measurement time . Secondary outcome study quantity quality self-reported screen time among mother child motivational quality music music-to-movement video . Additional secondary outcomes mother 's weight , workability , mental health mood . Specific aim study effectiveness intervention accelerometer use combination accelerometer plus music-to-movement video program mother-child pair . Materials method : Participants ( mother child -pairs ) Movement-to-music video program ( Moving Sound ) -study recruit cohort original Lifestyle , counsel exercise maternity care ( NELLI ) -project 14 municipality Pirkanmaa area . Participants randomize two group : accelerometer ( ACC ) vs. accelerometer plus movement-to-music video program ( ACC+DVD ) group . Objective measurement sedentariness physical activity base accelerometer . Information current health behavior base intervention questionnaire . In analysis physical activity , sedentary time body weight intervention control group compare . Effects mother 's musical ( PA ) background mediate factor analyze separately subgroup analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Experimental Study Music Sedentariness Among Mothers Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study Quite many people use music exercise example jogging gym . Anyhow mother might difficulty exercise small child thereby importance physical activity home increase . Consequently , need perform experimental study combine understand benefit music , objective physical activity measurement decrease sedentariness thereafter transgenerational obesity . Main objective current study decrease sedentary behavior increase physical activity among mother offspring use music-to-movement video program . Specific aim study effectiveness intervention accelerometer use combination accelerometer plus music-to-movement video program mother-child pair . Research question : I . Are change sedentary time physical activity use accelerometer movement-to-music video program ? Hypothesis : Movement-to-music video program develop mother-child pair decrease sedentary time wear accelerometer . There change moderate-to-vigorous physical activity , although amount light intensity physical activity increase . II . How motivational effect music affect physical activity ? Hypothesis : Movement-to-music video motivate mother-child pair increase physical activity decrease sedentary behavior . III . Is relationship mother ' musical background physical activity/sedentary behavior ? Hypothesis : Mothers ' musicality motivates exercise video program mother ' without musical background . Research method Accelerometer measure pretest . Main aim project reduce sedentariness among woman child . Accelerometer measure continuously tri-axial acceleration cause movement permit accurate individual assessment physical activity sedentary behavior . Data physical activity sedentary behavior collect tri-axial accelerometer ( Hookie AM 20 , Traxmeet Ltd , Espoo , Finland ) . The data collect raw mode analyze mean signal amplitude deviation ( MAD ) acceleration , permit accurate individual assessment physical activity sedentariness . The algorithm use present study base pilot study conduct UKK Institute . Accelerometers pretested eleven 2-9 year old child . Children different kind free movement , play , game test track field one hour . That do find scurry-like movement appear accelerometer . Another test run track test different speed slow walk maximum rate run . In addition accelerometer pilot ten 4-7 year child one week . On basis test acceleration signal act expect . Movement-to-music DVD production pretest . There three separate movement-to-music video program prepare Sibelius-Academy music education student specific course child 's music program spring 2014 . Directors , Soili Perkiö Eeva-Leena Pokela child 's music professional . The student group call Mutaveijarit ( The Mud Mates ) . Video program produce study . First second video last 10 minute include two song movement preparation . There three song altogether , title song Mutaveijarit track . The third video include song together without movement preparation . To rate motivational quality three song , panel 8 physiotherapist ( female ) assess song use Brunel Music Rating Inventory-2 ( BMRI-2 ; BMRI-3 ) . Another reason pretest find influence visual stimulus response music . BMRI-2 translated Finnish investigator study . Each song rat indicate one number 1 ( strongly disagree ) 7 ( strongly agree ) six statement much song would motivate person exercise . The possible range score 6-42 , wherein score 24 mean low/oudeterous , middle range 24-35 moderately score 36 mean highly motivating rating . Video group ( n=4 , mean age 41 year , SD 16,2 year ) first watch DVD assess three song separately use BMRI-2 . Then listen music ( without illustration ) rat motivational quality song . Music group ( n=4 , mean age 42,8 year , SD 15,8 year ) assess first motivational quality song . After music group watch DVD appraise music illustration together . In addition group move DVD rat motivational quality music movement . All song rat moderately motivate ( rating 31,4 34,6 ) . The rhythm , style , melody , tempo beat motivate movement video group music group . Music group assess sound motivate sound video group . During movement rhythm , style , beat motivate video group melody , tempo , sound motivate music group . As expect group music picture together motivate movement music alone . Data collection . Objective measurement sedentary behavior physical activity mother child collect first , second eighth week intervention use accelerometer . Body weight mother measure baseline . Information current physical activity , screen time , diet , self-reported weight , well information quality life collect baseline use questionnaire NELLI 5-years follow-up study ( base one-year follow-up questionnaire NELLI cohort ) . At 2 8 week baseline information physical activity , screen time , self-reported weight motivation exercise use movement-to-music video program collect questionnaire . Information child 's physical activity screen time collect baseline , 2nd 8th week baseline questionnaire . Statistical method . Effect intervention analyze follow intention-to-treat principle comparing change main outcome intervention control group participant . Multivariate method correspond analysis covariance logistic regression use . Non-paramet¬ric method also utilize need . In analysis physical activity , sedentary time body weight intervention control group compare . Subgroup analysis intervention group conduct mother 's motivation exercise movement-to-music video program effect musical background . Research material Participants Moving Sound -study recruit cohort original NELLI-RTC . Mother child -pairs ( n=837 ) invite NELLI 5-years follow-up study Moving Sound -study 14 municipality Pirkanmaa area . We expect get involved 30-40 % original cohort , 251-335 mother child -pairs , altogether . Randomization do 2:2 ratio , mean two mother-child pair intervention group per two pair control participant . For allocation participant appointment order list NELLI 5-years follow-up study use . Mothers randomize intervention control group use seal envelope contact sample NELLI-study . Power calculation study show approximately 91 mother child -pairs need , 80 % sedentary woman baseline anticipate difference sedentariness 25 % ACC ( accelerometer ) ACC + DVD ( accelerometer plus movement-to-music video program ) group intervention . If anticipate difference group small ( 25 % ) , number pair need 135 per group . In study sedentary woman define sit recline posture 76 % waking hour .</detailed_description>
