	<brief_title>A Randomized , Placebo-controlled Phase II Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Efficacy F8IL10 ( Dekavil ) Patients With Active RA Receiving MTX</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design formally demonstrate superiority F8IL10 v placebo evaluate safety efficacy two different dosage F8IL10 administer patient receive MTX . Patients enrol double-blind , parallel assign ( via automate randomization system ) 1:1:1 fashion one three different arm : - Arm 1 : placebo + MTX - Arm 2 : F8IL10 30 µg/kg + MTX - Arm 3 : F8IL10 160 µg/kg + MTX F8IL10 placebo subcutaneously inject week 8 week . Treatment terminate early following : completion 8 week therapy , withdrawal informed consent , unacceptable toxicity/intolerability study drug need increase MTX , oral corticosteroid NSAIDs dosage baseline level need introduce new DMARD biologic therapy control rheumatoid arthritis activity . The study conduct double blind fashion .</detailed_description>
