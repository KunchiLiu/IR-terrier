ESRD patient typically spend three five hour undergo dialysis three day week . Scheduling travel appointment difficult manage , increase patient caregiver burden , reduce patient ' quality life . These challenge keep many ESRD patient receive care condition outside dialysis setting , result high rate complication , emergent healthcare use . The patient-centered medical home ( PCMH ) model propose solution patient complex need ESRD . The purpose project compare PCMH model care usual care ESRD patient caregiver . We propose enhance usual care team ESRD patient provide primary care doctor context regularly schedule dialysis session add community health worker help support patient caregiver . Patient family stakeholder care team member assist design refinement PCMH model . We plan implement model University Illinois Hospital Health Sciences System ( UIHS ) dialysis center local Fresenius Medical Care dialysis center . Patients receive dialysis participate center receive initial comprehensive care visit follow ongoing care multispecialty provider team patient ' regularly schedule dialysis visit . Each patient 's care team include kidney doctor , primary care doctor , nurse coordinator , dialysis nurse , dietician , pharmacist , social worker , community health worker .

These improvement could potentially increase likelihood prevent complication identify problem earlier allow successful treatment . We expect enhance care team reduce emergency room visit hospitalization dialysis patient . In addition , anticipate addition community health worker clinical team help support educate patient caregiver result , patient quality life improve caregiver burden may reduce .</detailed_description>
