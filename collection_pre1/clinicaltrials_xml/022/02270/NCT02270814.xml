	<brief_summary>The purpose research study look effect treatment regimen call CACTUX head neck cancer . The CACTUX regimen combination three drug call cisplatin , nab-paclitaxel , cetuximab ( although carboplatin may give place cisplatin participant previously problem receive cisplatin ) . The use nab-paclitaxel combination different routine care , drug call 5FU often give instead , investigator group conduct previous research investigator incorporate nab-paclitaxel routine treatment cisplatin , 5FU , cetuximab . The investigator look incidence side effect CACTUX regimen well response disease health status .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm incurable HNSCC oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx , hypopharynx , and/or Level 13 neck node nonskin SCC unknown primary . `` Incurable '' define metastatic disease local regional recurrence previously irradiate site unresectable ( patient decline resection ) . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam per RECIST 1.1 . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Adequate hematologic , renal , hepatic function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN , unless bone metastasis present absence liver metastasis Creatinine IULN ( male 0.71.30 mg/dl ; females 0.61.10 mg/dl ) OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal At least 4 month since completion curative therapy , give previously . Availability diagnostic tumor tissue specimens correlative study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month complete treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Prior systemic therapy incurable disease . Grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy screening . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection , carcinoma situ cervix , synchronous H &amp; N primary . Currently receive investigational agent . Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cisplatin , nabpaclitaxel , agent use study . Previous grade 1 2 allergic reaction cetuximab permissible . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patient must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour start study treatment . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction study drug . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
