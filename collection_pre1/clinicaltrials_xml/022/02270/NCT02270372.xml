	<detailed_description>This two-part Phase 1b , open-label study ONT 10 administer combination varlilumab . Two different dos varlilumab study combination single agent recommend dose ONT 10 . Intermediate and/or low dos varlilumab ONT-10 may also study recommendation safety monitoring committee ( SMC ) . Treatment administer cycle 12 week . All patient receive single dose cyclophosphamide Day -3 . During Cycle 1 , patient receive ONT-10 administer SC per week 8 week follow ONT-10 every 6 week start Cycle 2 , combination varlilumab administer IV every 3 week x 3 dos , every 6 week cycle 2 5 . Each cohort enroll initial group 6 evaluable patient either breast ovarian carcinoma . Initial enrollment cohort stagger , first patient treat new cohort follow minimum two week occurrence Unacceptable Toxicity prior enrollment remain 5 patient . Subsequent enrollment cohort may continue without staggered schedule 6 patient treat consider evaluable . Up 24 additional evaluable patient may enrol treat Part 2 RD varlilumab ONT-10 identify Part 1 , include approximately equal number patient breast carcinoma ( n~12 ) ovarian carcinoma ( n~12 ) . Treatment Part 2 follow schedule Part 1 .</detailed_description>
