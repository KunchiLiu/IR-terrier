	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia common cause stroke . AF asymptomatic remain undiagnosed . Both prevalence AF proportion stroke relate undetected AF increase age . If AF timely diagnose treat accordingly anticoagulant , disable stroke prevent . In order help physician diagnose atrial fibrillation , MyDiagnostick develop . It CE certify device safe , user friendly easy use . This device capable detect exclude AF within one minute provide registration lead I ECG . The investigator aim perform 2-arm cluster randomize diagnostic trial among patient age 65 year visit general practice . In total investigator include 42 general practice randomly assign 21 MyDiagnostick arm 21 control arm . All person age 65 year visit general practice MyDiagnostick arm ask hold device every time visit surgery one year . The number newly detect case AF diagnostic screening strategy MyDiagnostick ( MyDiagnostick arm ) compare care usual ( control arm ) . Also , number patient treat anticoagulant accord CHA2DS2-VASc score compare arm . Finally , investigator assess number major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) , intracerebral hemorrhage major hemorrhage , all-cause mortality arm . End point assess blinded allocation . The investigator hypothesise MyDiagnostick improve diagnosis atrial fibrillation primary care accordingly treatment reduce adverse outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent validation study perform 200 patient visit cardiology outpatient clinic , sensitivity 100 % , specificity 96.4 % MyDiagnostics compare 12-lead ECG . Adequate comparison device accordingly treatment care usual need large scale implementation primary care set advocate .</detailed_description>
