A second challenge evaluate effectiveness molecular biomarkers natural history disease . RegisterNET registry aim collect data blood sample patient present NET USA . Data enter prospectively anonymized informed consent . All physician treat neuroendocrine tumor patient invited participate registry . Data evaluate within regular time frame , focus diagnostic accuracy biomarkers different type grade tumor , treatment modality patient outcome ( e.g . disease recurrence survival ) , thereby contribute understanding role biomarkers tumor management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RegisterNET - A Registry Neuroendocrine Tumors USA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Survival neuroendocrine tumor link early accurate diagnosis effective detection disease recurrence and/or treatment failure . Non-invasive biomarkers identify improve diagnosis prognosis patient . Little , however , know utility marker clinical practice . Objective : To systematically prospectively collect clinical information blood sample neuroendocrine tumor USA base histologically confirm diagnosis . Methods : All neuroendocrine tumor ( gastroenteropancreatic pulmonary ) follow informed consent . Data enter prospectively anonymized . Patient history include quality life survey complete contributing physician blood sample collect analysis . All information transfer database . Evaluation treatment modality patient outcome ( e.g . disease recurrence ) assess follow-up time . The primary objective project : - monitor patient neuroendocrine tumor - provide descriptive statistical analysis - assessment diagnostic accuracy molecular-based blood test The secondary objective project include : - assessment disease recurrence - analysis patient survival Analyses include : 1 . Descriptive statistical analysis include demographic , site , treatment , QoL assessment . 2 . Clinical follow-up blood chemistry result . 3 . Correlation analyse blood result clinical data . This include assessment time blood chemistry result significantly ( consistently ) increase time tumor recurrence evaluation whether change blood result predictive disease recurrence .</detailed_description>
