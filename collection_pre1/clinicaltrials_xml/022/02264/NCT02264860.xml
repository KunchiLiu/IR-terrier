	<detailed_description>This new proposal entitle `` The alveolar macrophage pool reservoir HIV '' address fundamental question ; specifically , alveolar macrophage pool serve reservoir HIV even peripheral viral suppression achieve anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) , reservoir alter environment within alveolar space impair alveolar macrophage immune function ? This critical question address lung infection remain leading cause death person live HIV even adherent ART . There compel experimental evidence HIV infection inhibit anti-oxidant defense within alveolar space cause severe redox stress . Based preliminary data present proposal , investigator hypothesize HIV inhibits expression action Nrf2 , master transcription factor activate anti-oxidant response element ( ARE ) , part induce zinc deficiency vulnerable microenvironment , thereby prevent alveolar epithelium alveolar macrophage generate glutathione anti-oxidants critically require maintain healthy redox potential within alveolar space . The investigator hypothesize result target inhibition Nrf2-ARE signal pathway , HIV promote ability infect alveolar macrophage accumulate large pool intracellular pro-virus produce large HIV reservoir within alveolar space . In parallel , HIV-induced oxidative stress shift alveolar macrophage toward alternative activation ( call 'M2 phenotype ' ) . As consequence , innate immune capacity alveolar macrophage impair confers resistance clear viral reservoir also render infect individual susceptible serious lung infection . The investigator leverage ongoing collaborative clinical study HIV-infected individual . As result , investigator ongoing access alveolar epithelial lining fluid macrophages well-defined subset HIV-infected individual , also expertise apply state-of-the-art basic technique HIV pathogenesis , metabolomics , redox signal test hypothesis . In parallel , investigator already conduct prospective clinical trial dietary zinc S-adenosylmethionine ( thiol anti-oxidant among many action increase glutathione pool alveolar space ) HIV-infected individual inadequate immunological response ART ( NCT01806870 ) . This unique cohort form foundation greatly expand clinical trial allow investigator test corollary hypothesis therapeutic strategy design improve zinc bioavailability redox potential within alveolar space enhance alveolar macrophage innate immune function significantly decrease HIV reservoir lung . This project produce novel insight target alveolar macrophage pool decrease HIV burden well improve lung health vulnerable individual .</detailed_description>
