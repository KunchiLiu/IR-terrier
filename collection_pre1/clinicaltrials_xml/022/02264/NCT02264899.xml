	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) neurodegenerative disorder think cause accumulation peptide amyloid beta hyperphosphorylated tau protein brain . There increase argument favor important role vascular damage development progression AD . The time course vascular alteration relate dementia AD pathology remain unclear , protocol allows development diverse vascular pathology score , hence track ageing , far develop widely validate . The aim project investigate , large clinical sample patient present either isolated cognitive complaint light mild cognitive deficit , vascular risk factor vascular alteration ( assess macro micro level ) relate cerebrovascular disease cognitive decline . The primary objective ancillary study investigate prospective association vascular risk factor , inflammation marker vascular damage cognitive decline neurodegeneration progression 4 year follow-up sample individual present spectrum cognitive profile range isolated cognitive complaint cognitive deficit without dementia . The secondary objective follow - To investigate role vascular risk factor ( diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ) vascular damage progression clinical dementia 4-year follow-up . - To study whether interaction change marker macrovascular microvascular structure cognitive deficit progression . - To study association BP , hypertension , antihypertensive treatment vascular damage , progression cerebrovascular disease see MRI cognitive decline dementia risk - To assess temporality vascular damage burden neurodegeneration - To assess association retinal vasculature defect brain neurovascular damage - To study link vascular damage AD pathology ( Cerebro-Spinal Fluid ( CSF ) Positron emission tomography ( TEP ) amyloid image ) biomarkers subsample participant measure available - To investigate inflammatory marker mediate association vascular damage neurodegeneration - To assess whether vascular factor neurodegenerative factor act independently synergistically course cognitive decline - To assess simultaneously impact vascular damage end organ ( brain , eye , kidney ) - To study correlation cerebral blood flow , measure Arterial spin-Labeled ( ASL ) MRI cognitive decline - To study whether genetic polymorphism reveal genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) AD vascular factor could modulate association vascular damage cognitive decline</detailed_description>
