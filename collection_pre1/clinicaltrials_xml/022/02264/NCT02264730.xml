	<brief_title>ClotFoam Adjunct Hemostasis Abdominal Surgery - Liver Bleeding Encountered</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open surgery bleed usually occur . Surgeons try stop bleed use his/her usual surgical practice . These include , limited : suturing ( stitch ) , ligation ( tie ) cautery ( burn order stop prevent bleeding ) . It often necessary surgeon use additional treatment stop bleeding . This may include use hemostatic product ( used stop bleeding ) . This Phase I study consist single arm evaluate safety ClotFoam adjunct hemostasis . ClotFoam® investigational product—a gelatin-based hydrogel carry fibrin monomer—that design supportive treatment general surgery improvement hemostasis , standard technique insufficient . The evaluation conduct 24 patient schedule undergo elective open surgery liver bleeding encounter require control mild-to- moderate bleed standard surgical technique expect ineffective and/or impractical . All subject meet eligibility criterion provide inform consent participate assign ClotFoam topical treatment . Subjects screen eligibility participate study schedule undergo elective ( non-emergency ) hepatic wedge resection anatomic resection ( 1 5 contiguous hepatic segment surgical procedure liver bleeding encounter removal gall bladder ( open ) , bile duct excision wherein appropriate target bleed site identify . Subjects undergo living-related liver donation also eligible . Participants post-operative follow ups day 1,2,5 , 10 post-procedure , 2 week post procedure , 12 week post-procedure . The follow visit consist safety evaluation ( physical exam , adverse event assessment , laboratory evaluation ) .</detailed_description>
