	<criteria>1 . Presence aortic aneurysm involve aortic arch deem warrant surgical repair require proximal graft placement Zone 0 Zone 1 : 1 . Fusiform ( ≥ 55 mm ) , 2 . Fusiform ( &gt; 2 time native aortic diameter ) , 3 . Saccular ( diameter criterion ) 2 . Subject consider high risk candidate conventional open surgical repair discretion Investigator 3 . Age ≥18 year time inform consent signature 4 . Subject capable complying protocol requirement , include followup 5 . Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) sign Subject legal representative 6 . Must appropriate proximal aortic landing zone , define : 1 . Must require placement proximal extent Aortic Component Zone 0 Zone 1 exclusion lesion 2 . Acceptable proximal land zone outer curvature length require device 3 . Landing zone inner diameter 1648 mm Zone 1 Subjects 2448mm Zone 0 Subjects 4 . Landing zone , must include either brachiocephalic leave common carotid native ostium , aneurysmal , heavily calcify , heavily thrombose 7 . Must appropriate distal aortic landing zone , define : 1 . Outer curvature length must ≥2cm proximal celiac artery 2 . Aortic inner diameter 1648 mm ( diameter must 1642mm use distal TAG® Device extension ) 3 . Landing zone aneurysmal , heavily calcify , heavily thrombose 4 . Landing zone native aorta previously implant GORE® TAG® Device 8 . Must appropriate target branch vessel land zone , define : 1 . Length ≥3 cm proximal first major branch vessel use Aortic Component 8 mm portal diameter , length ≥2.5 cm proximal first major branch vessel use Aortic Component 12 mm portal diameter ( require Zone 0 Subjects ) 2 . Target branch vessel inner diameter 615 mm use Aortic Component 8mm portal diameter , inner diameter 1118 mm use Aortic Component 12mm portal diameter ( require Zone 0 Subjects ) 3 . Target branch vessel land zone must native aorta aneurysmal , heavily calcify , heavily thrombose 1 . Concomitant aneurysm/disease ascend aorta , abdominal aorta require repair 2 . Previous endovascular repair ascend aorta 3 . Previous endovascular repair DTA nonGore device 4 . Surgery within 30 day treatment 5 . Infected aorta 6 . Dissection aorta 7 . Intramural hematoma aortic arch DTA without aneurysm 8 . Life expectancy &lt; 2 year 9 . Myocardial infarction stroke within 6 week prior treatment 10 . Patient systemic infection may increase risk endovascular graft infection 11 . Pregnant female time inform consent signature 12 . Degenerative connective tissue disease , e.g . Marfan 's EhlerDanlos Syndrome 13 . Participation another drug medical device study within one year study enrollment 14 . Known history drug abuse within one year treatment 15 . Significant thrombus atheroma aortic arch 16 . Tortuous stenotic iliac and/or femoral artery prevent introducer sheath insertion inability use conduit vascular access 17 . Planned coverage celiac artery 18 . Patient known sensitivity allergies device material 19 . Patient known hypersensitivity contraindication anticoagulant contrast medium , amenable pretreatment 20 . Previous instance Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 ( HIT2 ) know hypersensitivity heparin 21 . Diameter taper outside device size range proximal distal landing zone aorta inability use additional device different diameter compensate taper 22 . Mycotic aneurysm 23 . Persistent refractory shock ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg ) 24 . Patient body habitus medical condition prevents adequate visualization aorta</criteria>
