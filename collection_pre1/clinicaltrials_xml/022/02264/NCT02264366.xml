	<brief_title>Activity , Smoking Cessation , Healthy Eating Alcohol Intervention Program : ( ACCELERATION )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic disease include cancer , cardiovascular disease , lung condition diabetes lead cause mortality morbidity Canada worldwide . These chronic condition share common modifiable risk factor include physical inactivity , suboptimal nutrition , smoke excessive alcohol intake . Cardiac rehabilitation centre Coalition provide primary secondary prevention service many year focus behavioural risk , many participant heart disease also co-morbidities include cancer , diabetes lung disease . Co-morbidities clinical reality , long deal diseases singularly . Today , client population diverse ever fiscal constraint call pool prevention resource simultaneously address range chronic disease impact common risk factor . Extending reach population risk cancer chronic disease , population readily available referable In Ontario , UHN/Toronto Rehab cancer program woman survive breast cancer well woman undergo cancer treatment . Discussions Princess Margaret Hospital point opportunity extend program cancer patient people risk cancer . The ELLICSR arm Princess Margaret Hospital , focus help survivor , express interest collaborate reach family friend cancer survivor , primary prevention . Likewise , Odette Cancer Centre Sunnybrook Hospital see 900 new woman every year refer due family history breast cancer . They express u identify refer woman high risk develop breast cancer propose primary prevention program . Similarly , Quebec , L'Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal one nation 's high rat lung cancer group . Our Quebec partner , Centre de réadaptation cardio-respiratoire Jean-Jacques-Gauthier ( CRJJG ) strong tie program . With funding , able reach deliver prevention programme family friends lung cancer client , opportunity exists family friend tend engage open possibility lifestyle change . This partnered cancer centre Coalition : formalize exist partnership focus resource population risk cancer readily available referable primary prevention . The links Coalition partner primary care hold opportunity yet seize . In Ontario , Department Family Community Medicine Sunnybrook many patient risk , , multiple chronic disease . The opportunity exist reach pregnant woman obesity-related risk one could seize Canada-wide . The unfortunate reality obesity complicate 50 % pregnancy today . The opportunity , need , impact person 's family social circle Our program concept found idea 'you really need get whole family ' sustain long-term impact prevention change behaviour . We know evidence family/social support help . A systematic review childhood obesity identify promising strategy include parent support home activity encourage child active , eat nutritious food spend less time screen-based activity ( Waters et al , 2011 ) . As Lead Agency , UHN/Toronto Rehab already run successful Cardiac Rehab @ Home program six-month program see approximately 120 client per year . The average client live approximately 200kms away urban area , young , likely working , compare on-site client . An evaluation show program effective similar outcome on-site program : client make gain cardiovascular fitness likely adhere program . The study also show program cost-effective on-site program participant live remote area ( Scane et al , 2012 ) . Deepening broaden reach select risk population already connect u . Many core partner link local community year collaboration community prevention . Notably , BC partner , BC Cardiovascular Physiology &amp; Rehabilitation Laboratory , extensive primary prevention experience work 300,000 participant past 10 year community-based program child ( school-based out-of-school ) , workplace wellness ( e.g . police firefighter ) population group risk chronic disease . Additionally , solid partnership Aboriginal community throughout BC . Formal partnership forge Aboriginal community throughout BC include extensive research rural remote community . Through Coalition 's work history Aboriginal community , know evidence health benefit Aboriginal people participate community-based physical activity intervention , ACCELERATION program could deliver relative ease community BC . The Centre de réadaptation cardio-respiratoire Jean-Jacques-Gauthier ( CRJJG ) provide prevention program patient cardiovascular ( heart disease heart failure ) respiratory disease ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma ) . One unique aspect ongoing asthma prevention work coalition member . This adult asthma population , average , young classical rehabilitation group ( ca . 40 year old ) , whilst overt cancer cardiovascular disease , normally display several risk factor , provide model engage adapting ACCELERATION program kind population . Furthermore , CRJJG conveniently house within YMCA Cartierville . There , therefore , already strong partnership YMCA . The propose program allow Quebec partner deliver prevention program YMCA user risk factor family history chronic disease . In addition , YMCA Cartierville unique partnership local council provide free access non-YMCA local community member , thus allow ACCELERATION programme deliver diverse cultural socio-economic community base . Finally , CRJJG specific expertise motivational interviewing ( MI ) , client-centred communication tool focus enhance intrinsic motivation change particular behaviour , explore resolve ambivalence behavior change ( Lavoie et al , 2012 ) . At Eastern end Canada , province Nova Scotia one high rate cardiovascular disease country prevalence 6.4 % ( Heart Stroke Foundation , 2012 ) . There also excess incidence prevalence lung , colorectal , prostate , melanoma breast cancer ( Canadian Cancer Society ) . This one reason choose partner Nova Scotia . Our partner run Community Cardiovascular Hearts Motion ( CCHIM ) program community-based exercise health education program . Referrals accept predominantly family doctor also specialist ally health professional include physiotherapist , nurse practitioner diabetes clinic . Patients expand complete vascular spectrum primary care level secondary prevention . There also Heart Health Clinic available assist individual live complicate high risk cardiac pulmonary disease ( tertiary ) . The successes program translatable ACCELERATION program target people risk cancer chronic disease , well family friend people suffer acute event associate chronic disease . Our Nova Scotia partner note strong representation female primary prevention arm CCHIM obese diabetes . The planned Ontario program ante- post-partum woman risk obesity-related cancer replicable Nova Scotia female population , would seek transfer knowledge replicate program Nova Scotia well . There also opportunity reach underserviced black population . Incidence rate ratio African Canadians relative general population Nova Scotia significantly elevate circulatory disease , diabetes psychiatric disorder ( Kisely et al , 2008 ) . Our Nova Scotia partner ( CCHIM ) see opportunity provide virtual program population . CCHIM present development translational research move beyond `` brick mortar '' reach patient population need program virtue risk establish disease , , attend . This run primary care physician local health care team ( NP clinic , addiction service , etc ) . It allow adaptation implementation patient `` ready '' engage ( similar smoking cessation per `` Ottawa Model '' ) . This approach adapt present project effort expand exposure evaluate element sustainable upon project completion . In Ontario , South Asian population large visible minority group Ontario , one high prevalence chronic disease compare group ( Statistics Canada , 2010 ; Fraser Health , 2013 ) . They would benefit targeted program like ACCELERATION customize , make culturally appropriate belief , value custom . Deepening prevention impact workplace Two key partner ( BC NS ) exist partnership large employer . In BC , partner formal research relationship City Richmond . They evaluate risk chronic disease approximately 200-300 City Richmond worker year . The propose program allow introduction workplace wellness program worker . We estimate award program current workplace wellness program expand meeting need family friends city worker meet direct mandate City Richmond employer . Our Nova Scotia partner engage Capital District Health Authority ( CDHA ) workplace , draw participant population 10,000 employee . Having set program virtualization program offer unique opportunity address benefit risk patient well application program common yet possibly difficult workplace sector access .</detailed_description>
