	<brief_summary>Activation sympathetic nervous system associate increase risk ventricular arrhythmia sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . Development simple , noninvasive , reliable tool measure sympathetic outflow human subject therefore highly desirable . Microneurography current gold standard measurement technique , whereby multiunit postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity record tungsten ultrafine microelectrodes insert selectively nerve fascicle peroneal nerve . Though technique consider extremely safe , use successfully decades human translational physiology experiment , adopt routine clinical assessment due requirement sophisticated equipment specific technical training skill . Alternatively , many adopt heart rate variability simple , noninvasive technique assess sympathetic nerve activity . However , heart rate variability directly measure sympathetic nerve activity , much debate literature exact source sympathetic nerve traffic . For example , many believe accurate reflection cardiac sympathetic nerve activity , accurately reflect change muscle skin sympathetic nerve activity . To address limitation , investigator develop simple , noninvasive technique measure sympathetic nerve activity use surface electrode . Despite great promise , new approach yet directly validate . The purpose study therefore validate new technique ( refered EKG-NA ) current gold standard measurement technique , microneurography .</brief_summary>
