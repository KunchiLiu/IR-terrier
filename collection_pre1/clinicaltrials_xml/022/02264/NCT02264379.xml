	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If patient find eligible take part study , patient assign study group base size lesion ( ) discretion responsible physician . Up 71 patient enrol study . If patient treat standard radiotherapy , patient receive 25 fraction 2 Gy metastasis , treatment duration 5 week . If patient treat image-guided hypofractionated radiotherapy , patient receive 3 fraction 10 Gy metastasis , treatment duration 1 week . Radiation Planning Treatment : During radiation treatment , image take treatment closely analyzed treatment . The patient 3 25 radiation treatment per metastasis depend discretion responsible physician . The rest radiation treatment plan treatment delivery appointment unchanged . The dose give tumor number treatment patient receive , determine discretion responsible physician , affect take part study . Follow-Up Visits : After radiation treatment schedule end , patient return follow-up visit follow time point : - At 3 month - Then , every 3 month 1 year , - 1 time year , long possible Additional follow visit may schedule , responsible physician think need . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Any updates medical history patient record patient asked side effect patient may . - The patient 's performance status record . - The patient 's complete symptom questionnaire review . - The patient clinical examination - The patient follow-up imaging ( MRI ) check status disease .
