	<detailed_description>Essential laparoscopic operation adequate visualization . Unfortunately grade system assess degree quality visualization . There many contribute factor either assist hinder quality . Compared open surgical procedure , laparoscopic surgical procedure ( Laparo-endoscopic Single Site ( LESS ) conventional multiport ) associate less postoperative pain , low wound infection rate , short length hospital stay reduce incidence late ventral hernia ( 1 ) . Despite well document benefit laparoscopic procedure , laparoscopy certain patient population challenge . Preoperative factor contribute technical difficulty performance laparoscopic procedure include male gender , android body habitus , body mass index ( BMI ) great 30 kg/m2 ( 2 ) . Men often android body habitus , whereby excess body fat concentrate within peritoneal cavity , increase intra-abdominal pressure thus reduce intraoperative laparoscopic visualization . Intra-abdominal pressure measure morbidly obese patient 2-3 time higher non-obese patient . In addition , android body habitus high BMI often associate enlarged leave lobe liver . These factor contribute degree intraoperative technical difficulty weigh selection appropriate patient undergo laparoscopic procedure . Particularly early period surgeon 's learning curve , suggest selection criterion laparoscopic procedure upper abdomen limit patient low BMI previous upper abdominal surgery . Although low BMI relatively good predictor less challenging laparoscopic procedure , high BMI necessarily predict intraoperative technical difficulty . We predict best method determine technical difficulty laparoscopic procedure intraoperative evaluation . For example , primary limit factor determine technical difficulty laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGBP ) size thickness leave lobe liver . A massively enlarge leave lobe liver obscures laparoscopic view gastro-esophageal junction angle His , make gastrojejunal anastomosis difficult construct . Schwartz et al . support concept find large liver primary reason conversion laparoscopic open RYGBP analysis 1,000 patient ( 2 ) . A laparoscopic operation consist make small puncture peritoneum , , camera surgical instrument subsequently insert . The laparoscopically place camera view operative field . Since point view constantly change meet surgeon 's need operation , different exoscopic view surgeon , surgeon well trained interpret image laparoscopic view . For LESS operation , deflectable tip laparoscope utilized aid surgeon improve visibility less clashing instrument . The laparoscopic view reveal , one time , structure surgeon need see order complete surgical procedure success . These structure , instance , hide behind peritoneal wall ( e.g. , ureter ) . This limitation lead less efficient operation , also lead complication . Often structure extract preoperative CT/MR image ; however , surgeon need interpret fuse image laparoscopic view . To alleviate problem , propose laparoscopic visualization score system base intraoperative quality image ( 3 ) . The impact muscle relaxant isolate abdominal wall diaphragmatic behavior absolute intra-abdominal volume difficult measure . Conversely , inflate volume-pressure relationship abdominal cavity easy measure . A description volume-pressure relationship identify previous study . Clinical data support positive linear correlation depth neuromuscular blockade abdominal wall diaphragmatic relaxation compliance ( 4 ) . There tangible real effect neuromuscular blockade ; ultimately direct impact quality visualization surgical field laparoscopic procedure ( 5 ) . A constant neuromuscular block lead preferable work condition surgeon . The evoked muscle response neurostimulation register electromyography ( EMG ) , mechanomyography ( MMG ) acceleromyography ( AMG ) . In principle , different peripheral nerve use neurostimulation . The EMG record electrical signal generate muscular action potential surface electrode . The force thumb stimulation register MMG . The AMG record acceleration thumb neurostimulation . The EMG , MMG AMG system allow observation measure signal quantity quality ( 6 ) . We identify relevant factor significantly affect quality visualization different laparoscopic procedure include : 1 . Clarity , focus brightness : The laparoscope typically consist outer ring optical fiber use transmit light body , inner core rod lenses illuminate visual scene . This relay back camera . Various different type laparoscopes available ; specify term overall length , number rod , diameter angle view . Generally speaking , wide scope brighter result image . Lenses available range 1.9mm 12mm , size 5mm 10mm common choice pediatric adult patient , respectively . 2 . Breadth intra-abdominal field vertical space measure centimeter : Breadth intra-abdominal field vertical space factor directly related pressure insufflation well level neuromuscular blockade . 3 . Distracting factor : This specific category distract factor include : 1 . Blood : presence , especially large quantity , may prevent adequate visualization . 2 . Smoke : unipolar electrocautery and/or bipolar Maryland forceps produce smoke use . The rate aspiration evacuation also affect visualization . 3 . Adhesions : presence intra-abdominal adhesion , hinders prohibit proper identification anatomic structure . 4 . Sterile iodine impregnate cover sheet : application presumably negative impact abdominal wall diaphragmatic compliance , therefore , may obscure visualization . 5 . Intra-intestinal air : presence air inside stomach , small large intestine adversely affect size visual field . This prevented adequate preoperative bowel preparation placement aspiration NG tube anesthesia induction . 4 . Patient 's specific factor BMI value body habitus : From experience , BMI 26 allow optimal field visualization . Conversely , BMI great 26 negatively impact visual field . However , recent study conduct Camani et al . 2010 show laparoscopic approach various application gynecologic surgery significantly influence BMI term surgical outcome , laparotomy conversion rate , intraoperative postoperative complication rate , duration hospital stay ( 4 ) . We feel visualization operation involve abdominal cavity adversely affect high amount adipose tissue , therefore , visualization score system help support theory . 5 . Type disorder ( malignant vs. benign ) laparoscopic procedure undertaken : Due many pathologic factor need R0 resection , discovery advance disease anticipate , presence adhesion scar tissue previous operation , laparoscopic procedure malignant disorder may require good visualization field laparoscopic procedure undertake benign disorder . 6 . Inadequate and/or poorly design instrument : Most laparoscopic instrument development technology-driven . This approach instrument design always consider ergonomics user , therefore leading user-unfriendly product ( 4 , 5 ) . 7 . Technical difficulty : An intraoperative technical difficulty define significant deviation ordinary surgical procedure . All conversion open operation iatrogenic bowel perforation laparoscopic surgery examples technical difficulty . Many study demonstrate technical difficulty laparoscopic-assisted surgery jeopardize intra-operative postoperative patient safety . 8 . Patient 's body position laparoscopic procedure : A study lead Mulier , J et al . 2010 demonstrate Trendelenburg position lower abdominal surgery reverse Trendelenburg flex legs hip upper abdominal surgery effectively improve workspace obese patient , even full muscle relaxation ( 6 ) . II . Objectives A.Primary Objective The primary objective develop laparoscopic visualization score system . B . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective : 1 . To determine visualization affect various level pneumoperitoneum correlate neuromuscular blockade . 2 . Identify factor influence visualization , determine manage factor optimize visualization . 3 . Determine statistically significant correlation different degree visualization follow intraoperative time interval : 1. surgical incision sterile wind dress 2. sterile wound dress extubation 3. sterile wound dress patient exit operating room 4 . Determine statistically significant correlation different degree visualization postoperative pain .</detailed_description>
