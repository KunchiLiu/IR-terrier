	<brief_summary>Standard treatment soft tissue abscess involve incision area maximum fluctuance drainage purulence abscess cavity . The use bedside ultrasound guide drainage potential improve treatment outcomes ensure complete drainage cavity . Our hypothesis use ultrasound guidance incision drainage soft tissue abscesses decrease treatment failure rate compare standard blind incision drainage . This hypothesis test utilize blind , randomize trial compare standard incision drainage ultrasound guide incision drainage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>4 ) Background* The incidence soft tissue infection increase , represent 30 million emergency department visit per year . While extensive research recent year surround use antibiotic soft tissue abscess , surgical management remain unchanged standard therapy consist blind incision drainage abscess cavity . Despite incision drainage spectrum antibiotic coverage , treatment failure rate infection range 5-20 % . It possible part treatment failure attribute inadequate abscess cavity evacuation . With blind drainage , possible residual purulence unforeseen satellite abscess cavity contribute persistence infection . Ultrasound show aid identification soft tissue abscesses help differentiate cellulitis abscess . Over last decade , clinician perform bedside ultrasound become standard practice emergency medicine proficiency requirement place graduate emergency medicine resident . While many practitioner fact adopt ultrasound use identification abscess , subsequently use ultrasound procedural guidance . We specifically interest study use ultrasound identify ideal location initial incision well use post procedural ultrasound confirm complete evacuation abscess purulence . 5 ) Inclusion Exclusion Criteria* Subjects enrol study include patient present emergency department diagnosis soft tissue abscess . This include patient age gender exclude individual give consent prisoner ( return follow contact follow ) . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Soft tissue abscess suspect patient history physical exam confirm bedside ultrasound 2 . Able provide write consent/ assent 3 . Incision drainage perform ED physician Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Peritonsillar abscess 2 . Pilonidal cyst , genital perirectal abscess 3 . Post-surgical wound infection 4 . Pregnant 5 . Prisoners 6 . Previous incision drainage current abscess 6 ) Study-Wide Number Subjects* N/A - Not multi center study . 7 ) Study-Wide Recruitment Methods* Study subject recruit patient population emergency department Memorial University campuses UMASSMemorial Medical Center . Patients sign symptom soft tissue abscess confirm bedside ultrasound identify enrolled treating physician . This occur 24 hour day , 7 day week . 8 ) Study Timelines* A study subject 's participation study last 1 week time enrollment . This consist initial study visit ( emergency department encounter treatment abscess ) , follow-up visit 2-3 day wound evaluation wick removal , telephone encounter 1 week 10 day . Based previous study conduct group similar patient population study protocol , anticipate enrollment 274 patient take 2 year . 9 ) Study Endpoints* The primary endpoint failure treatment 7 day . This define follow : 1 . Need repeat incision drainage 2 . Need additional antibiotic coverage 3 . Hospital Admission intravenous antibiotic follow initial encounter 10 ) Procedures Involved* Patients present emergency department suspect superficial abscess require incision drainage eligible enrollment . Patients randomize one two group : 1 ) Ultrasound Guided Incision Drainage 2 ) Standard Incision Drainage . As patient identified enrollment , investigator open study packet contain standardize data collection sheet , consent document random designation treatment group . Group 1 Protocol : Ultrasound-guided Incision Drainage Patients identify require Incision Drainage . An initial ultrasound perform localize abscess cavity . Anesthetic provide standard fashion inject skin around abscess . Incision skin overlie abscess cavity drainage purulent material follow repeat ultrasound ass complete drainage . Any additional pocket identify targeted drainage repeat ultrasound image demonstrates abscess cavity completely drain . This post procedural ultrasound perform patient currently undergo ultrasound guided drainage superficial abscess . In patient drainage complete , surgery consult . The procedure complete placement iodoform wick bulky dress . Patients place oral antibiotic discretion treat attend physician instructed return 2-3 day emergency department re-evaluation wick removal sooner problem arise . If necessary , additional drainage maybe perform . Additional I &amp; D perform without ultrasound discretion attend physician . A telephone follow-up 7-10 day post-procedure perform . Questions ask follow locate follow-up data sheet . See attachment addendum . Blinding treatment group accomplish follow determine outcome treatment perform individual blind initial ultrasound finding treatment group . Group 2 Protocol : Standard Incision Drainage Patients identify require Incision Drainage* . Anesthetic provide standard fashion injection skin around abscess . Incision skin overlie abscess cavity drainage purulent material follow placement iodoform wick bulky dress . Patients place oral antibiotic discretion treat attend physician instructed return 2 day emergency department re-evaluation wick removal sooner problem arise . If necessary , additional drainage maybe perform . Additional I &amp; D perform without ultrasound discretion attend physician . A telephone follow-up 7 day post-procedure perform . This follow group 1 . The research personnel introduce research personnel UMASS inform subject follow recent visit ED . They ask question telephone follow-up data sheet refer conduct follow . Blinding treatment group accomplish follow determine outcome treatment perform individual blind initial ultrasound finding treatment group . *This decision may make solely base history physical exam inital identification ultrasound . If presence abscess initially identify without ultrasound , original treating physician continue perform Incision Drainage procedure . If presence abscess initially identify ultrasound another physician need perform standard Incision Drainage . The second physician liberty perform standard history physical ass presence abscess prior drainage . The second physician may another resident attend physician oversee patient 's care , provide blind initial ultrasound identify presence abscess . A standardized data sheet record patient information , result procedure , time perform procedure , need additional drainage post-procedure recurrence abscess , need change oral antibiotic coverage need admission intravenous antibiotic . 12 ) Data Management* Power Calcuation - Assuming alpha 0.05 beta 0.2 projected failure rate blind incision drainage group 20 % , 119 subject group require detect 20 % reduction treatment failure . Accounting 15 % loss follow-up require total number subject 274 subject . Patients assign group undergo analysis use intention treat principle . Data store password-protected computer lock office department emergency medicine University Campus UMASSMemorial Medical Center . Only study personnel UMASS IRB access data . Descriptive data analyze use mean standard deviation . Comparison group perform use Chi square analysis ( categorical data ) Student 's T-test ( continuous data ) .</detailed_description>
