	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate whether 's feasible give radiation therapy use MRI-guided adaptive technique . MRI-guided adaptive radiation therapy involve adjustment re-planning treatment day day participant receive treatment . The adaptive technique previously use different fashion adjust treatment plan fact , use MRI scan re-plan treatment participant still table new way use adaptive technique . This may allow doctor use radiation treat tumor well protect normal tissue . A special radiation treatment machine incorporate MRI scanner radiation treatment device plan treatment do use machine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptive MRI-Guided SBRT Unresectable Primary Oligometastatic Central Thorax Abdominal Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In trial , feasibility deliver online , adaptive MRI-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy oligometastatic disease use novel , integrated Co-60-MRI machine evaluate . To best ass technology , focus three specific oligometastatic disease sit historically highlight limitation SBRT . Specifically , enroll patient oligometastatic disease central thorax , liver , non-liver abdomen receive adaptive , MRI-guided SBRT MRI simulation MRI treatment gate . Patients treat five fraction one two week . By adhere strict normal tissue constraint , expect toxicity within current standard care , allow adaptation base daily anatomic change . The prescription dose determine base hard normal tissue constraint , cap 15 Gy per fraction . Although long-term goal achieve improve local control disease-free survival reduce toxicity , present study drive short-term goal demonstrate feasibility on-table adaptive approach , never previously report .</detailed_description>
