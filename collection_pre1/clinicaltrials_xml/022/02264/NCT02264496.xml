	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer fourth common cancer UK . Surgical resection mainstay curative therapy . With screen program enable early detection , surgery play important role treatment strategy . Surgery impart significant physiological psychological stress cancer patients.Recent research demonstrate fast-track approach utilising regional anaesthesia , early mobilisation good oral intake improve outcome reduce physiological stress response surgery . The primary objective study determine whether define exercise programme improve recovery reduce complication surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomised Trial Exercise / Antioxidants COlorectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This prospective randomise pilot clinical trial . For purpose pragmatism , subject investigator blind treatment allocation . The study blind impossible blind investigator patient exercise programme . Patients undergo major resectional surgery colorectal cancer recruit Academic Surgical unit ( ASU ) , Castle Hill Hospital . In total , 60 participant recruit pilot study randomly allocate 2 group outline . The study necessitate participant involve baseline assessment take average 60 minute patient attend Castle Hill Hospital . Travel cost meet . All participant ask 15 ml blood sample entry study 24-48 hr prior surgery . Regardless recruitment , blood sample necessary clinical purpose stag patient part routine preoperative assessment prior colorectal surgery . The aim permit analysis possible change antioxidant status prior surgery preconditioning . This would addition routine blood sample require . The two group study describe detail . Both group shall receive standard care normal patient undergoing colorectal resection surgery . The difference group shall addition exercise preconditioning session group 1 . We anticipate three time week last 60-90 minute duration . Travel cost meet . Groups The 60 patient study randomise one two group follow : - Group 1 - Standard care + Exercise intervention . Patients group participate 2-4 week low volume , moderate intensity , supervise , one one , individualise exercise programme . - Group 2 - Standard care ( Control ) group . These patient enter supervised exercise programme . Research hypothesis 1 H0 - A two four week period low moderate intensity exercise prior surgery use individualised exercise intervention reduce post-surgical length hospital stay colorectal cancer patient . H1- A two four week period low moderate intensity exercise prior surgery use individualised exercise intervention reduce post-surgical length hospital stay colorectal cancer patient . Research hypothesis 2 H0 - A two four week period low moderate intensity exercise prior surgery use individualised exercise intervention modify body 's defence system future oxidative stress . H1- A two four week period low moderate intensity exercise prior surgery use individualised exercise intervention modify body 's defence system future oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
