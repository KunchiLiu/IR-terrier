	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether antimicrobial stewardship program decrease length hospital stay patient pneumonia . The antimicrobial stewardship program run pharmacist doctor extensive training manage infectious disease . These two health care professional responsible reviewing record patient admit hospital pneumonia , make specific recommendation patient 's attend physician manage antibiotic treatment . These recommendation might include discontinue antibiotic , change way antibiotic deliver intravenous form pill form , among many potential option . The attend physician considers whether recommendation follow reject . The study control group patient review antimicrobial stewardship team , length hospital stay compare review group patient . Any difference two group assume due impact antimicrobial stewardship program . So far , previous study able demonstrate antimicrobial stewardship program reduce length stay patient admit hospital pneumonia . This study important difference previous study may make conclusion accurately reflect true impact antimicrobial stewardship program . The important difference time review model analysis study result . Because time review varies patient , patient review earlier later time , subtle difference , account analysis , mask true positive effect program length stay . The investigator study account variation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Antibiotic Use Hospitalized Patients With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In immune-competent adult patient admit hospital ward diagnosis community-acquired pneumonia , multi-faceted ASP utilize prospective chart audit feedback compare usual care reduce LOS without increase risk death readmission 30 day post-discharge hospital ? In Ontario , pneumonia lead cause death bacterial infection account 18,000 year life lose annually due premature mortality . Pneumonia account majority antibiotic utilization hospital outpatient setting . Evidence-based guideline diagnosis management pneumonia available physician . Adherence evidence-based guideline associate reduced mortality antibiotic utilization . Antimicrobial stewardship define intervention minimize unwarranted variation antimicrobial utilization evidence-based best practice intent improve patient safety quality care . Unwarranted refers absence patient- disease-specific reason justify practice variation evidence-based practice standard . Antimicrobial stewardship operationalized many different way , prospective audit feedback ( persuasive approach ) restrict antimicrobial prescribing policy ( restrictive approach ) appear efficacious intervention achieve goal antimicrobial stewardship . Antimicrobial stewardship program demonstrate efficacy improve antimicrobial prescribing reduce rate hospital-acquired infection . Antimicrobial stewardship program direct CAP patient demonstrate reduction mortality , fail demonstrate reduction length stay . All participant admit patient Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre ( RVRHC ) , 319 bed community-based , university-affiliated , acute care hospital locate Barrie , Ontario , Canada . All patient enrol study admit one four medical ward . All study patient admit hospitalist service . Admission medical ward control bed allocation , non-medical administrative service within hospital responsible patient flow assign patient care . Hospitalists assign one specific medical ward , provide care across medical ward . All eligible CAP meet ASP review criterion expose ASP intervention . The ASP intervention ( ASP-i ) consist prospective chart audit physician feedback ( persuasive ) approach . The ASP member conduct audit make recommendation consist infectious diseases-trained pharmacist ( LM ) infectious disease train physician ( GD ) . All patient review member . The ASP intervention ( ASP-i ) recommendation guide Infectious Diseases Society America CAP guideline Canadian Thoracic Society guideline management chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The possible ASP-i recommendation base recommend National Health Service United Kingdom include follow : ) No change current care ii ) Discontinue antibiotic ( ) iii ) Intravenous oral conversion iv ) Duration therapy v ) Dosing change vi ) Narrow broaden spectrum therapy The ASP-i recommendation mutually exclusive . All recommendation document patient 's electronic medical record communicate directly attend physician ASP member . This pragmatic control clinical study intend measure effectiveness 'real world ' program . The ASP-i implement modify stepped wedge design ; baseline patient data collect enrolled patient medical ward first three month study , ASP-i introduce medical ward non-randomized sequential fashion two month interval medical ward expose intervention . The unit analysis individual patient adjust potential clustering effect within hospital ward . The primary outcome length hospital stay ( LOS ) measure minute document time admission document time discharge ( censor ) . All patient administratively censor 14 day hospital admission discharge home . Enrollment patient start April 1 , 2013 . The study expect enroll patient March 31 , 2015 . All consecutive patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion eligible intervention . The ASP-i intervention may implement anytime 48 hour post-admission patient meet criterion ASP review . All patient experience outcome 14 day admission censor study . Patients die transfer ward ( intensive care unit hospital ) also censor . Patients discharge hospital censor contacted 30 day post-discharge determine adherence antibiotic prescription ( relevant ) , survival status readmission status . The sample size expect current study 'fixed ' previously estimate 400 500 CAP patient per calendar year . The accrual period 24 month . Assuming 70 % patient control arm achieve primary outcome discharge alive hospital , set power = 0.8 statistical significance ( 2-sided ) α = 0.05 , detectable ASP-i effect size estimate approximately 20 % reduction length stay . An extended Cox regression analysis use compare primary secondary outcome control intervention group . Violations proportional hazard assumption covariate identify use method Schoenfeld residual . Results report hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval . Time ASP-i model time-variant covariate final model account time-dependent bias . Other variable know associated primary secondary outcome also include final model , include ; age , sex , charlson comorbidity index , CURB-65 score , time ( day ) clinical resolution , complication pneumonia empyema . Fixed effect ward outcomes account include indicator variable final model . Maturation ASP-i effect outcome time adjust include categorical time variable final model ( time variable define 'quarter ' start study ) . A dichotomous variable acceptance rejection ASP-i part interaction term control/intervention group variable permit per protocol analysis .</detailed_description>
