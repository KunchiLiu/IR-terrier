	<brief_summary>The duration adverse event non-cuffed catheter patient hemodialysis investigate multicenter prospective cohort . Totally , 1,400 patient chronic renal failure require hemodialysis enrol . 900 patient give right internal jugular catheterization , 500 patient unsuitable right internal jugular catheterization receive femoral catheterization . Every patient followed-up six month . During following-up period , duration time adverse event non-cuffed catheter record detail , include inadequate hemodialysis blood flow , venous stenosis , venous thrombosis , infection , catheter thrombosis . The central vein evaluate CT Angiography identify stenosis last visit 6 month . This multicentre trial provide evidence develop guideline duration time use non-cuffed catheter .</brief_summary>
