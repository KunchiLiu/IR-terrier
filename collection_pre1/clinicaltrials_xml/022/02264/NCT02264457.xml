	<brief_summary>During cataract surgery artificial lens implant eye . These artificial lens call intraocular lens ( IOLs ) many different type IOL design . Your eye astigmatism , normal common characteristic eye . If leave uncorrected astigmatism would mean would need wear spectacle view distance object . New IOL design call toric IOLs help correct astigmatism improve vision cataract surgery . This study design look well toric IOL corrects astigmatism need wear spectacle view distance object . There many design toric IOLs study look compare two different design toric IOLs put one lens right eye different type lens leave eye . Both lenses commercially available commonly implanted IOLs . Using new non-invasive method hope able good judge visual performance lenses ability lens correct astigmatism . In addition study involve image examining IOLs determine prevalence post-operative complication .</brief_summary>
