	<brief_title>Icotinib Completed Resected IB NSCLC With EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy show little evidence survival benefit patient stag IB non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) complete resection . Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKIs ) show great efficacy patient EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Icotinib novel EGFR-TKI develop group Chinese scientist clinician . In phase III ICOGEN trial , icotinib non-inferiority efficacy gefitinib well safety . This study study icotinib see well work treat patient fully resect stage IB NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation .</detailed_description>
