	<brief_summary>Clinical social worker , doctor , outreach worker , staff provide direct care vulnerable population face multiple challenge obtain maintain train implement evidence base practice diverse community setting . Motivational Interviewing well-established evidence base practice challenge implement across program agency require skill gain train reinforced service provider employ practice . This study build finding Phase I study . With funding Phase I Small Business Innovation Research grant National Institute Health , Center Social Innovation develop Motivational Interviewing Simulator : An Experiential Online Training Tool . The interactive , case-based , multiplayer web-based game allow service provider deepen skill Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , widely recognize evidence-based practice support people make positive behavior change relate health , wellness , mental illness , addiction . The Phase II randomize control trial 's primary aim ass relative effectiveness three intervention ( MI Training Only ; MI Training + eBook ; MI Training + SIM ) increase provider MI knowledge skill retention time . During Phase II study , recruit 180 provider 18 community agency serve individual live supportive housing , many history mental illness , addiction , homelessness , medical problem . After receive standardized two-day onsite MI training , participant randomize one three condition : 1 ) MI Training Only ; 2 ) MI Training + eBook ( online comparison comparable information Simulator without interactive element ) ; 3 ) MI Training + Simulator . The longitudinal , mixed method study assess provider ' acquisition retention MI knowledge skill survey cod standardized client interview ; barrier facilitator MI implementation via focus group ; organizational-level data via key informant interview site visit ; client outcomes 3,600 client survey , administrative , data focus group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Motivational Interviewing : An Experiential Online Training Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 2011 2012 , Center Social Innovation , LLC ( C4 ) , develop evaluate prototype Motivational Interviewing Simulator : An Experiential Online Training Tool . The interactive , case-based , multiplayer web-based game allow service provider deepen skill Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , widely recognize evidence-based practice support people make positive behavior change relate health , wellness , mental illness , addiction . Phase I study finding support product 's feasibility need large-scale randomized trial determine tool 's effectiveness . During Phase I , participant Simulator group show significant improvement MI skill measure Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity ( MITI ) score ( 34 % improvement baseline ) Helpful Responses Questionnaire ( HRQ ) score ( 13 % improvement baseline ) —both substantially high rate improvement participant control group . This project represent Phase II work develop MI Simulator study impact provider behavior client outcome . Phase II create multiple `` play arena '' —Single Player , Two Player , Advanced Free-play spaces—and multiple case-based scenario relate mental health , homelessness , addiction , primary care . The significantly expanded product wide appeal across large workforce provider serve vulnerable population , support National Institute Mental Health 's strategy `` close gap development new , research-tested intervention widespread use need . '' The Phase II randomize control trial guide four specific aim . The first aim diversify prototype Motivational Interviewing Simulator meet need wider audience . Based Phase I find , build prototype add Single Player Arena , expand exist Two-Player Arena , create Advanced Free-play Arena learner go beyond basic MI skill . Additionally , expand product include multiple scenario , story-lines , character arena , multiple level play scenario . The second aim evaluate Simulator randomize control trial . The third aim disseminate finding . And fourth aim prepare commercialization . Phase II seek answer number Research Questions concern service provider , client , organization . Research question pertain service provider follow : What relative impact intervention provider ' confidence , knowledge skill acquisition retention ? What support need provider adhere MI model fidelity time ? And Does impact treatment condition vary amount time service provider spend engage Sim eBook tool ? One key research question pertain client follow : Do client serve provider receive Sim eBook intervention show improve outcome housing stability receptiveness mental health treatment , medication adherence , great satisfaction provider , great confidence individual treatment recovery plan , relative Training Only group ? Two key research question focus organization implement MI follow : How agency context influence provider adherence MI model ? And , What organizational-level barrier facilitator successful MI implementation fidelity ? Phase II test four hypothesis ( H1 , H2 , H3 , H4 ) . H1 predict provider Simulation condition show strong knowledge skill retention study period compare MI Training Only MI Training + eBook condition . H2 predict provider eBook condition strong knowledge skill retention study period compare MI Training Only Condition . H3 predict client serve provider Simulation condition show great improvement housing stability receptiveness mental health treatment , medication adherence , great satisfaction provider , great sense confidence individual treatment recovery plan compare client MI Training + eBook MI Training Only condition . H4 predict client serve provider Simulation condition show improved communication provider great sense confidence individual treatment recovery plan compare client provider MI train + eBook MI Training Only . The Motivational Interviewing Simulator : An Experiential Online Training Tool ( Sim ) potential make significant contribution field behavioral health , primary care , adult learning , dissemination science , beyond . Phase I project demonstrated feasibility product development effort research approach . Phase II support allow Center Social Innovation ( C4 ) expand depth sophistication product , evaluate efficacy , lay groundwork Phase III commercial roll-out . Specifically , Phase II add multiple arenas level prototype simulator , allow user advance deeply Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) practice . The Phase II product expansion also create multiple story-lines , variety character , expand opportunity feedback , feature expand product 's marketability Phase III . As described , Sim strong commercial potential fit well C4 's exist commercial training platform , t3 ( think . teach . transform . ) learn initiative . The project valuable various way . Firstly , SIM potential improving live vulnerable people . The ultimate goal product improve live people experience mental illness , addiction , homelessness , violence , traumatic event . MI proven positive impact clinical outcome marginalize group . We believe effective training workforce use MI result well care people would otherwise slip crack system . Secondly , SIM potential add value workforce . As C4 expand reach thousand direct service provider across United States internationally , document lack high-quality training opportunity behavioral health workforce hunger train part agency individual providers—particularly MI . Much exist training limited onsite workshop , conference , face-to-face training . The online product exist provide opportunity peer-to-peer learn specific focus ( diabetes substance use ) include mental health . This product provide engage , highly interactive opportunity learn set skill many provider want acquire . Thirdly , SIM potential impact dissemination science . If Sim prove successful mode learning , primarily `` booster shot '' follow face-to-face training , implication dissemination evidence-based practice significant . We envision family learn simulation product build upon architecture develop project , cover wide range practice skills—helping close research- practice gap move effective practice field quickly . The expected outcome study include finding document product 's effectiveness . Expected research outcomes include improvement provider knowledge skill , documentation organizational strategy support uptake best practice , improve outcome client , include increase housing stability great engagement mental health service . The Sim bring together well-documented best practice , need ongoing provider training , cutting-edge simulation technology . Through widespread dissemination follow Phase II , Sim potential tremendous impact , improve skill service provider live people serve .</detailed_description>
