	<criteria>Disease Related : 1 . Diagnosis CLL/SLL meet IWCLL diagnostic criterion . 2 . Age 65 yrs old OR less 65 year , must least one follow criterion : Cumulative Illness Rating Score ( CIRS ) &gt; 6 Creatinine clearance estimate &lt; 70 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation . Del 17p FISH TP53 mutation PCR Next Generation Sequencing 3 . Active disease meeting least 1 follow IWCLL criterion require treatment : Evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development , worsen , anemia thrombocytopenia Massive , progressive , symptomatic splenomegaly Massive node ( least 10 cm long diameter ) , progressive symptomatic lymphadenopathy . Progressive lymphocytosis increase 50 percent 2month period lymphocyte double time ( LDT ) &lt; 6 month . LDT may obtain linear regression extrapolation absolute lymphocyte count obtain interval 2 week observation period 2 3 month . In patient initial blood lymphocyte count &lt; 3,000/µL , LDT use single parameter define indication treatment . In addition , factor contribute lymphocytosis lymphadenopathy CLL ( eg , infection ) exclude . Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and/or immune thrombocytopenia poorly responsive corticosteroid standard therapy . Autoimmune hemolytic anemia define least one marker hemolysis ( indirect bilirubin upper limit normal ( ULN ) due liver disease , increase lactate dehydrogenase ( ULN ) without alternative etiology , increase absolute reticulocytosis ( ULN ) bone marrow erythropoiesis absence bleeding AND least one marker direct indirect autoimmune mechanism ( positive direct antiglobulin IgG C3d , cold agglutinin ) . Immune thrombocytopenia define platelet ≤100,000/µL increase megakaryocyte bone marrow exam . Constitutional symptom , define one follow diseaserelated symptom sign , document patient 's record prior randomization : unintentional weight loss &gt; 10 percent within 6 month prior screen . significant fatigue ( inability work perform usual activity ) . fever &gt; 100.5°F 38.0°C 2 week prior screen without evidence infection . night sweat 1 month prior screen without evidence infection . 4 . Measurable nodal disease compute tomography ( CT ) , define least 1 lymph node &gt; 1.5 cm long diameter site previously irradiate . An irradiated lesion may assess measurable disease document progression lesion since radiotherapy end . Laboratory 5 .
