	<brief_summary>The purpose study use photo-plethysmographic [ PPG ] waveform signal guide dialysis ultrafiltration [ UF ] chronic maintenance hemodialysis patient , investigator understand homeostasis hemodialysis . The investigator hypothesize signal generate PPG device along traditional monitoring nursing judgment , allow experience , oriented staff anticipate hemodynamic instability , intervene prevent mitigate intradialytic hypotention [ IDH ] , forestall onset non-facilitating compensatory reflex preclude patient achieve appropriate post-dialysis weight consistent euvolemia . Furthermore , hypothesize nephrologist staff able wean patient anti-hypertensive medication craft patient specific dialysis order UF profile achieve consistent , comfortable treatment appropriate end point . The study aim include : Aim 1 : To confirm temporal sequence PPG signal change BP routine hemodialysis . Aim 2 : To refine predictive algorithm PPG , augment continuous cardiac event monitoring ( pre-intra-post hemodialysis ) Aim 3 : To develop targeted intervention reverse cardiovascular stress indicate PPG maintain perfusion . Aim 4 : To develop care path approve medical staff primary care nephrologist allow RNs respond signal PPG .</brief_summary>
