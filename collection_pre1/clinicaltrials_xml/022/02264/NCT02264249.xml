	<brief_title>Residual Gastric Volume Same Day Versus Split Dose Evening Before Bowel Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ASGE ACG develop standard high-quality colonoscopy ADR . Bowel cleanse must optimal enhance polyp detection several study demonstrate advantage split dose day preparation oppose ingesting preparation day . It recommend patient undergo split dose bowel preparation even day bowel preparation optimal cleanse . This critical high quality colonoscopy . One risk associate colonoscopy pulmonary aspiration . Part risk may relate retain gastric volume gastric pH time endoscopic procedure . Aspiration pneumonia may relate acidity acidic aspirate may cause severe respiratory compromise . In recent article , Huffman support safety split dose bowel preparation ( 4L bowel preparation ) outpatients undergoing colonoscopy . In study was/found residual gastric volume split dose preparation higher patient undergo EGD alone different patient receive bowel preparation evening . Early morning bowel prep patient undergo upper low endoscopy evaluate study . To knowledge , relationship residual gastric volume day bowel prep evaluate compare split dose bowel prep . A formal evaluation difference gastric acidity evaluate patient undergo bowel prep colonoscopy . The study prospective observational design . The patient already schedule combine esophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy specific indication ask part study . No additional intervention do procedure already schedule . No specific intervention assign subject study . Outcomes assess pre-defined group base bowel preparation take patient . The fluid go collect suction container without solidifier material . Once endoscopist enters stomach fluid suction part customary process endoscopy . Once fluid aspirate , container remove empty fluid measure canister endoscopic procedure continue container solidifier material instead connect suction . The pH measure gastric fluid aspirate use calibrate catheter pH device .</detailed_description>
