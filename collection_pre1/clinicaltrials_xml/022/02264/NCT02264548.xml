	<detailed_description>A dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define grade 3 , 4 5 toxicity event consider definitely , probably possibility relate protocol radiation therapy . Patients complete protocol therapy due acute radiation side-effects also consider DLT . The general ( non-exhausive ) list organ base toxicity could relate type radiation therapy include toxicity liver , kidney , bowel , spinal cord , pancreas . Side-effects exclusively due TKI target therapy consider DLT protocol . Three patient recruit first cohort trial . These patient PTV prescribe dose 25 Gray give 5 daily fraction period one week ( first treatment start Wednesday Thursday , plan treatment successive business day ) . All therapy deliver within 10 business day include treatment break acute toxicity . After 3 patient see 4 week follow visit , CTCAE version three note . If precisely 1 patient DLT , additional 3 patient recruited cohort give treatment . If patient DLT , new cohort 3 patient treat increase dose 30 Gray 5 fraction . Similar criterion dictate whether trial end , continue next cohort treat dose 35 Gray 5 daily fraction . There maximum 4 cohort ( 25Gy , 30Gy , 35Gy , 40Gy ) study assume early DLT issue , contain 3 6 patient . Allowance -1 cohort arm 20 Gy 5 fraction make protocol early DLT issue . The diagram display schema detail . Any patient complete protocol therapy due toxicity issue unavailable 4-week toxicity assessment consider non-evaluable . These patient need replace term study accrual . Patients give TKI therapy 4 week window post-RT order allow proper evaluation RT intervention ; however , treat oncologist ultimately override best medical interest patient ( e.g . progressive symptomatic systemic disease )</detailed_description>
