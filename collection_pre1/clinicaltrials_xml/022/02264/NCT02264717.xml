	<brief_summary>1 . The primary purpose study determine diagnostic accuracy CADscore System , new danish technology record sound turbulence bloodflow coronary vessel . And secondary : 1 . To determine accuracy cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , secondary test detection obstructive anatomic coronary artery stenosis coronary compute tomographic angiography ( CCTA ) . 2 . To examine patient population bio-genetic marker relate development arteriosclerosis . 3 . To evaluate virtual fractional flow reserve ( vFFR ) compute coronary angiogram .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary study CCTA currently first choice rule coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient typical atypical chest pain . 4500 patient annually examine CCTA , Central Jutland Region Denmark , approximately 80 % discharge ruling CAD . CCTA diagnostic scan expose patient radiation , therefore good risk stratification prior test desirable . The CADscore newly develop danish technology test far 1000 patient . An area curve receiver operate characteristic ( AUC ROC ) 75-80 determine compare conventional coronary angiography use quantitative coronary angiography ( CCA-QCA ) . This indicate CADscore could potentially use diagnose CAD supplement risk stratification prior CCTA . We aim evaluate CADscore large clinical trial include 2000 patient clinical indication undergo cCTA . After cCTA approximately 20 % ( 400 patient ) need evaluation CCA FFR . CADscore result compare CCTA CCA-QCA . Secondary , CADscore compare result CCA-FFR perfusion scan , Cardiac-MRI SPECT . Substudies 1 . Perfusion scan CCTA demonstrate good diagnostic performance detection exclusion anatomic coronary artery stenosis , several study previously show CCTA low positive predictive value identification hemodynamically significant CAD . This emphasize need additional test evaluate severity ( exclusion ) hemodynamically significant CAD . Measurement FFR CCA represent `` gold standard '' assessment hemodynamic significance coronary artery stenosis . The disadvantage CCA FFR invasive procedure . After cCTA approximately 20 % ( 400 patient ) need test group patient randomize either Cardiac MRI SPECT follow CCA FFR . The substudy aim evaluate diagnostic accuracy perfusion imaging ( Cardiac MRI SPECT ) compare CCA FFR . 2 . Virtual FFR The accuracy precision virtual-FFR compare conventional FFR determine . Virtual FFR compute coronary angiogram use computational fluid dynamic . Subjects diameter stenosis range 30 90 % visual estimate one vessel segment reference diameter â‰¥2.0 mm include analysis . FFR reference standard determine presence absence hemodynamically significant obstruction cut-off value 0.80 . Computation vFFR without hyperaemia compare .</detailed_description>
