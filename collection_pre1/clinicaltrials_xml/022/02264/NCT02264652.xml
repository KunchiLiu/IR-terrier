	<detailed_description>1 Introduction This document protocol human research study . This study conduct accordance US government research regulation , applicable international standard Good Clinical Practice , institutional research policy procedures . 1.1 Background Focal Status epilepticus ( FSE ) characterize prolonged , self-sustaining , anatomically discrete seizure last long one hour ( time long day week ) associate definable neurologic behavior ( Schomer 2005 ) . Symptoms FSE vary accord function brain area affect , vary discharge , simple repetitive limb movement see epilepsy partialis continuum ( EPC ) , subtle inability write command name object . Prevalence EPC estimate 1 per one million ( Cockerell 1996 ) . A large proportion FSE episodes resultant acute neurologic insult stroke hemorrhage , although , time , cause FSE remain unknown . FSE treatment commence promptly upon recognition use predefined treatment protocol . The goal treatment rapid termination seizure minimize acute chronic effect emergency allow prompt assessment management underlie precipitant ( Loddenkemper 2011 ) . Furthermore , patient may suffer refractory partial onset epilepsy , suffer frequent seizure despite maximize medical therapy , may place high risk FSE EPC . Yet many instance FSE , EPC , refractory partial onset epilepsy resistant pharmacotherapy , require nonpharmacologic treatment . Accordingly , investigatorspropose Phase-1 clinical trial test safety tolerability High Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) , -noninvasive technology capacity suppress seizures patient frequent partial onset seizure , eventually FSE EPC . The investigator plan use Soterix HD-tDCS device . The device current-controlled source generates constant output current . In word , device automatically maintain constant output current decrease increase output voltage need long surpass device compliance voltage , provide added safety measure . The HD-tDCS device pose non-significant risk 1 . The device implant potential serious risk health , safety , welfare subject 2 . The device purport use support sustain human life potential serious risk health safety welfare subject 3 . The device substantial use diagnosing , cure , mitigate , treat disease otherwise prevent impairment human health potential serious risk health safety welfare subject 4 . The device otherwise present serious risk health safety welfare subject . The investigator anticipate step toward eventual wider application HD-tDCS . tDCS Basics : tDCS painless safe method focal brain stimulation . tDCS base decades-old observation neuronal firing modulate low amplitude electrical direct current ( DC ) . Specifically , apply cerebral cortex , cathodal DC inhibit neuronal firing . The mechanisms cathodal DC reduce neuronal fire likely relate hyper-polarization soma membrane occur apical dendrite neuron orient toward cathode constant electric field . The practical application tDCS simple : low amplitude DC administer via broad scalp electrode ( typically saline-saturated sponge ) cerebral cortex expose cathodal DC beneath one electrodes - remaining , ( anodal ) electrodes place anywhere else body , propose , circumferentially around cathode . tDCS method also recently adapt rat experimental work disease model ( Rotenberg 2008 ; Kabakov 2012 ) . Over 600 study publish use standard tDCS without significant adverse event . In recently publish safety tolerability study 131 subject involve tDCS experiment University Pennsylvania . significant adverse event occur . With commonly report mild side effect tingle ( 76 % ) , itch ( 68 % ) , burn ( 54 % ) , pain ( 25 % ) . Direct electrical current stimulation presently FDA-approved extracranial use , FDA application cranial stimulation ( tDCS ) management mood disorder chronic pain progress . Currently , number clinical protocol use tDCS cranial application ( include previous approved protocol PI ) , consider tDCS non-significant minimal risk device ( please see attached documentation ) . Figure 1 : Principle tDCS induce reduction excitability . ( leave ) Cathodal tDCS result outward direct cortical current , hyperpolarizes somatic cell membrane . This turn , reduce excitability . Anodal opposite effect . HD-tDCS technology allow uni-directional polarization ( cathodal/reduced excitability ) well stimulation small cortical target . Thus , leverage well-established mechanism DC control safety tDCS , HD-tDCS allow u explore , first time , target hyperpolarization seizure control . ( right ) As establish decade research ( right panel Purpura McMurty , 1965 ) DC current instantly modulate neuronal fire direction specific manner cathodal stimulation suppress firing , well epileptiform activity ( ) . tDCS Advantages : tDCS unit inexpensive light-weight . The electrical supply derive conventional 9-volt battery . The scalp electrode fasten second . tDCS combine easily therapy , may require resuscitation acutely-injured patient . tDCS presently investigation treatment epilepsy , excess cortical excitability prominent feature disease process , neuronal inhibition may beneficial . Thus SE , tDCS may offer practical therapeutic option analogous hypothermia pharmacologic suppression neuronal activity benefit easy , rapid focal application set acute seizure form brain injury . Figure 2 : Soterix Medical Inc. ( SMI ) HD-tDCS system include battery power base unit , HD electrodes , cap . The system validate clinical trial designate non-significant-risk FDA . SMI develop custom HD electrodes `` cup '' design integrate EEG head-gear . The EASYcap headgear show 4x1 HD electrode montage . Using 10/20 system electrode record ( filled circle ) allow interlaced site position HD electrode ( open circle ) . The EASYcap provide range adult pediatric size . The system portable , deploy simply , even integrated EEG use subject move . 1.2 Preclinical Data Recent clinical study cathodal tDCS focus chronic treatment epilepsy show mild anti-epileptic effect tDCS deliver interictally . The rationale behind interictal tDCS application reliance tDCS effect outlast stimulation ( plasticity ) . Though result early animal clinical study suggest plasticity-based approach warrant consideration , , investigator propose exploit well-established acute effect DC current . Thus , mechanistically innovative approach leverage robust acute effect DC polarization ( Durand 2001 ; Kabakov 2012 ) . Refractory partial onset epilepsy represent sustain state brain hyper-excitability ( analogous slice model ) , expect instantly suppress weak DC . High definition transcranial direct current stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) establish safety tolerability profile enter clinical arena treatment number neurologic disease state , mood disorder chronic pain , post-stroke motor deficit , patient may benefit focal modulation cortical excitability . There similar tolerability data small number subject HD-tDCS ( Minhas 2010 ) . Some subject may experience skin irritation redness treatment resolve within hour . However , hand 1mA per HD electrode , last skin irritation ( &gt; 24h ) never observe ( N &gt; 100 ) even prolonged study ( N &gt; 40 ) . Many patient receive standard HD-tDCS treatment report less sensation HD-tDCS , likely electrolyte gel produce good contact skin compare saline-soaked pad ( Kuo et al ) . Indeed NSR designation propose study obtain FDA ( please see support document ) .. Recent study group others extend tDCS experiment preclinical experiment rat seizure model , demonstrate electrical control tDCS abort ongoing seizure reduces associate brain injury . Here investigator propose apply cathodal HD-tDCS ( Fig 2 ) , inhibitory variant technology , specifically suppress cortical excitability terminate seizures well-selected group patient demonstrate frequent focal onset seizure . Figure 3 : Comparison neuromodulation focality use HD-tDCS 4x1-Ring deployment vs. conventional tDCS ( leave ) High-resolution individualized finite element model FEM computer simulation . ( top ) Conventional tDCS large `` sponge '' pad electrodes result diffuse un-focal brain stimulation , bi-directional ( depolarized/activated hyperpolarized/inhibited region ) . ( bottom ) In contrast , HD-tDCS Ring stimulation result highly targeted cortical area stimulation . Directly electrodes unidirectional ( hyperpolarization ) . These improvement achieve HD-tDCS highly relevant clinical aim proposal .</detailed_description>
