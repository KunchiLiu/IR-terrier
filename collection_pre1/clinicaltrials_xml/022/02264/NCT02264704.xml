	<brief_summary>This study aim determine effect exercise intensity within 15 week programme moderately disabled people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Although early research show exercise safe may improve health related factor mobility fatigue , intensity exercise offer benefit yet define . Participants randomly assign one three group - high intensity , moderate intensity usual care . Participants exercise group ( high moderate intensity ) take part supervise 15 week cycling exercise programme base Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre . Those assigned usual care ( control ) group continue receive usual medical care participate exercise programme . The acute immune response exercise also measure . Participants three group monitor regularly . Clinical outcome study include immunological marker , exercise capacity , mobility , fatigue , quality life cognitive ability . These measure combination blood test , physical assessment questionnaire . It hypothesise high intensity exercise cause favourable , anti-inflammatory response associate great improvement physical psychological outcome moderate intensity exercise usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruited patient initially undergo baseline measurement include BMI . Neurotrophin ( BDNF NGF ) cytokine ( IFN-Y IL-4 ) concentration measure participant serum use commercially available ELISA kit ( R &amp; D system ) . Assessments cognitive ability , mood , fatigue quality life also perform use psychometric test describe outcomes . Exercise capacity mobility also measure . Participants also undergo maximal exercise test , recently validate use patient population ( Heine et al. , 2014 ) . Briefly , rest participant initially cycle power 25W whilst maintain minimum cadence 60rpm 5 minute warm-up . This lead directly testing period , power increase incrementally ( 15W per minute ) point volitional termination drop cadence 10rpm minimum ( 60 rpm ) . Peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 peak ) use measure cardiorespiratory fitness . Participants randomly assign one three group - high intensity ( HI ) , moderate intensity ( MI ) usual care ( UC ) . Exercising group take part 15 week programme . All exercise perform cycle ergometer carry twice per week 15 week ( 30 session ) Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre , Irvine . In session HI participant exercise intermittently ( 30 second 30 second ) 80 % peak power ( base maximal exercise test ) 15 minute . MI participant exercise continuously 40 % peak power 15 minute . To ensure exercise intensity remain consistent throughout programme workload progressively increase time accommodate increase participant fitness level measure % HR . UC participant participate supervise exercise programme continue receive usual care . 5 week completion exercise programme , follow-up test session occur .</detailed_description>
