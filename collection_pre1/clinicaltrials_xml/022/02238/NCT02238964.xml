	<detailed_description>Closure complex contaminate abdominal wound challenge carry risk , include wound dehiscence incisional hernia . Use biological mesh situation may provide safe method reduce complication , especially long-term incisional hernia . ROCSS use stoma site closure model biological mesh placement difficult contaminate abdominal wall closure . Hernia site stoma closure occur 30 % patient associated adverse effect quality life . In 10 % case , patient submit complex re-operation carry significant morbidity . Not patient report symptom undergo repair , wish major operation . Incisional hernia site stomas closure form important well define subgroup . If measurable benefit mesh insertion , elective use collagen mesh would warrant consideration closure difficult , contaminated abdominal wound . This study also provide useful information value use CT scan early diagnostic tool herniation , could use future abdominal wall study surrogate endpoint clinical hernia . ROCSS aim ass whether biological mesh ( collagen tissue matrix ) reduce incidence clinically detectable stoma closure site hernias two year compare standard closure technique . The primary outcome Occurrence clinically detectable hernias two year post randomisation . Other outcome include surgical re-intervention rate , surgical complication 30 day post-operation 1 year post-randomisation , quality life post-operative pain , cost-benefit analysis radiological hernia rate one year post-randomisation ( exploratory analysis compare radiological hernia rate 1 year clinical hernia rate 2 year assess value use CT scan early diagnostic tool incisional hernia ) . Randomisation 1:1 Strattice® mesh vs. standard closure . The sample size trial 560 ( 80 % power , 10 % dropout/crossover , 40 % proportional reduction - 25 % 15 % ) recruitment 2 year least 30 centre . ROCSS double blind ( observer blind ) randomise control trial CT scan one year clinical follow 2 year . Cost benefit analysis quality life analysis perform 2 year . The sample size review prior reach target may increase 790 ( 90 % power , 20 % dropout/crossover , 40 % proportional reduction - 25 % 15 % ) .</detailed_description>
