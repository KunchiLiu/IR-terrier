	<brief_summary>18F-FluoroethylCholine ( 18F-FECH ) new tracer use PET synthesize Nuclear Medical Center Peking Union Medical College Hospital favor diagnosis primary brain tumor . Although 18F-FECH show high presence biological distribution liver , 18F-FECH PET may higher sensitivity diagnosis intra- extra-hepatic lesion HCC respectively 18F-FDG 11C-acetate PET scan , 18F-FECH PET could promise tool diagnosis staging , therapy selection prognostic evaluation HCC patient . However , much case require verify theory . The purpose study establish model clinical experimental prospective study , evaluate sensitivity , specificity accuracy 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FluoroethylCholine Positron Emission Tomography : Promising Diagnostic Tool Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) rank sixth cancer incidence third cancer mortality worldwide . The diagnosis HCC make basis tumor marker image examination CT MRI present . The commonly used serological marker alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) , sensitivity range 33 % 85 % 56.3 % average . The sensitivity CT MRI diagnosis small HCC lesion ( diameter ≤ 2cm ) report 20 % 27 % respectively . Therefore , distinction small malignancy benign lesion use tumor marker test conventional image method may difficult unreliable . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) widely use oncology . Fluorine-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) PET seem powerful image method diagnosis breast cancer , gastric cancer , colorectal cancer . However , previous study show limited diagnostic sensitivity 18F-FDG PET HCC lesion ( 54 % ) , make 18F-FDG PET additional value conventional imaging diagnosis HCC . 11C-acetate PET use diagnosis various malignant tumor . Compared 18F-FDG PET , 11C-acetate PET increase sensitivity ( 63.6 % ) diagnosis well-differentiated HCC , present high avidity acetate rather glucose . However , still high rate misdiagnoses , insufficient complement 18F-FDG PET good diagnosis . 18F-FECH new tracer use PET synthesize Nuclear Medical Center Peking Union Medical College Hospital favor diagnosis primary brain tumor . 18F-FECH show high presence biological distribution liver rarely use HCC diagnosis . Recently , find 18F-FECH may present high sensitivity diagnosis intra- extra-hepatic lesion HCC respectively , much high 18F-FDG 11C-acetate PET scan . Therefore , 18F-FECH PET could promise tool diagnosis staging , therapy selection prognostic evaluation HCC patient . However , research require assess accuracy application prospect 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC . The aim study : 1 . To establish model clinical experimental prospective study , evaluate sensitivity , specificity accuracy 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC . 2 . To assess accuracy 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC early stage ( diameter ≤ 3cm ) , explore difference 18F-FECH PET imaging finding early late HCC lesion order guide clinical application future . 3 . To evaluate effectiveness 18F-FECH PET differential diagnosis HCC liver benign lesion hemangioma , focal nodular hyperplasia ( FNH ) , hepatic adenoma , primary neuroendocrine tumor . 4 . To evaluate effectiveness 18F-FECH PET differential diagnosis HCC hepatic malignancy ( ICC , HCC-ICC , CC , malignant lymphadenoma , sarcoma adenocarcinoma ) metastatic neoplasm . 5 . To explore clinical pathological characteristic HCC patient may affect accuracy 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC , determine condition patient suitable 18F-FECH PET scan explore whether liver disease , cirrhosis would affect diagnostic efficacy 18F-FECH PET . The characteristic include tumor size ( diameter ≤ &gt; 3cm ) , number lesion , Edmondson grade ( include immuno-histochemistry ) , tumor thrombus portal vein , extra-hepatic metastasis , clinical stage ; patient ' age , sex , history disease ( include chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis , metabolic disease hepatolenticular degeneration , genetic disease Gaucher disease Niemann-Peak disease ) , liver function ( Child-Pugh grade ) coagulation function . 6 . To search difference accuracy 18F-FECH PET 18F-FDG PET diagnosis HCC , explore value HCC diagnosis . 7 . To detect relationship 18F-FECH PET imaging finding prognosis HCC patient treatment , determine whether 18F-FECH PET imaging finding use independent factor evaluate prognosis HCC . 8 . To explore mechanism image feature specific finding 18F-FECH PET diagnosis HCC , may offer potential help analyze 18F-FECH PET result .</detailed_description>
