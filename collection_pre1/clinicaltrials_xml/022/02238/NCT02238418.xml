	<brief_summary>Vitamin D see anymore phosphocalcic bone hormone , also effect global health ( anti-infective , anti-inflammatory , anti-tumour role cardiovascular protection ) . Until recently , vitamin D repletion define minimal concentration enable prevention rickets child osteomalacia adult , i.e , approximately 8 ng/mL ( 20 nmol/L ) . However , international expert agree set minimal threshold 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration , high one previously admit , limit 20 ng/mL ( 50 nmol/L ) define vitamin D deficiency limit 30 ng/mL ( 75 nmol/L ) define vitamin D insufficiency . Recommendations Vit D supplementation healthy child update France 2012 . The invariable supplementation infant toddler efficient since deficiency-related rickets almost disappear ; however information ill child population . Vit D supplementation tolerance usually consider good over-dosage risk low , however study conduct 30 year ago , far know , study calcium urinary excretion kinetics intake 100 000 IU vial cholecalciferol ( Uvedose® ) . When 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration exceed 200 ng/mL , rare daily practice , toxic effect Vit D may theoretically observe , particularly hypercalcemia hypercalciuria . Vitamin D deficit common child chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) 50 92 % prevalence depend study ; risk factor secondary hyperparathyroidism . Although international guideline regard care CKD child recommend 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration 75 nmol/L , practical recommendation term dose frequency native Vit D treatment . Therefore , objective present study follow : - validate prospectively efficacy service usual care Vit D supplementation child adolescent see paediatric nephrology department . - study effect Vit D supplementation ( 100 000 IU vial cholecalciferol ) calciuria patient .</brief_summary>
