	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness drug call temsirolimus combination drug call perifosine treat brain tumor continue grow previous treatment . Temsirolimus intravenous drug approve FDA treatment cancer ( kidney cancer , certain type lymphoma ) brain tumor . Perifosine pill approve FDA block messenger tell cancer cell grow . Research suggest combine treatment drug well either alone , reasonably safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine Torisel ( Temsirolimus ) Recurrent/Progressive Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma common primary brain tumor , glioblastoma ( GBM ) common subtype adult , represent 50 % glioma . Standard initial treatment newly diagnose GBM consist maximal surgical resection follow radiotherapy tumor bed chemotherapy oral DNA alkylator , temozolomide . However , recurrence nearly universal despite standard therapy . There standard treatment recurrence . Median survival 15 month diagnosis 6 month recurrence . Once patient develop tumor progression , conventional chemotherapy generally ineffective .</detailed_description>
