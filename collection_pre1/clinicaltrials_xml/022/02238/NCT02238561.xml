	<brief_summary>The investigator examine relationship post-operative oxygen consumption ( use non-invasive measurement technology ) complication patient contemporary major abdominal surgery . The investigator hypothesis major surgery may trigger physiological stress response result increase post-operative metabolic demand oxygen consumption ( V̇O2 ) must meet increased oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) . 1 . To determine feasibility non-invasive measurement oxygen consumption ( V̇O2 ) use indirect calorimetry cohort patient 2 . To determine feasibility non-invasive measurement oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) cohort use non-invasive measure cardiac output , oxygen saturation haemoglobin ( pulse wave transit time co-oximetry technique )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective observational study non-invasive measurement V̇O2 DO2 pre-operatively 8 time point 48 hour postoperatively cohort 40 patient undergo elective major abdominal surgery ( open laparoscopic ) pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) . As pilot work examine relationship post-operative oxygen consumption complication patient contemporary major abdominal surgery , investigator need define grade severity complication . The Post-Operative Morbidity Survey ( POMS ) simple outcome scale design record incidence clinically important complication - specifically complication likely keep patient hospital . A POMS score perform Day 5 likely discriminative patient recover well , develop complication . POMS easily perform , good internal validity predictive prolong length stay . POMS simple additive scale ; however patient POMS score 1 great highly likely remain hospital , whereas score 0 likely able go home .</detailed_description>
