	<brief_summary>The sympathetic nervous system , part nervous system stimulate heart via release substance , noradrenaline adrenaline ( combine call catecholamine ) , becomes activated people heart failure . As people become sicker , nervous system become active , cause damage heart . Large trial show Angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor reduce morbidity mortality patient heart failure . Higher dos drug effective low dos . Studies show ACE-inhibitors decrease catecholamine level . This could congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patient take class drug show improvement heart function . There several way measure activity sympathetic nervous system . The common measurement test blood catecholamine level . This reliable reproducible . Microneurography new technique use measure sympathetic nerve activity . A small electrode ( comparable acupuncture needle ) place muscle nerve hook stimulator recorder . It produce direct recording skeletal muscle nerve traffic . Both rate amplitude burst measure . The result technique highly reproducible . By use technique get accurate picture nervous system respond medication give treat heart failure . Losartan ( Cozaar ) angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor blocker . It block bind angiotensin II , hormone constricts blood vessel . As result blood vessel remain relaxed , leading reduction workload heart . Minor decrease blood catecholamine level report low dose drug . The purpose study see whether high dose losartan ( 200 mg ) great effect sympathetic nervous system low dose losartan ( 50 mg ) . A total 30 participant recruit . Participants assign one two group : high-dose , subject receive treatment 200 mg/day losartan , low-dose , subject receive treatment 50 mg/day losartan . Via microneurography investigator measure difference sympathetic activity subject high-dose vs low-dose losartan . The investigator expect see decrease sympathetic activity high-dose group low-dose group .</brief_summary>
