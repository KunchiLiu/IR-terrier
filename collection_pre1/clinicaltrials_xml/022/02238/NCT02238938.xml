	<brief_summary>Currently , colonoscopy safe way detect bowel tumor polyps , since biopsied remove one work process . If size adenoma large 2 cm , resection usually do hospital setting . For resection large adenoma , different approach use . The so-called piecemeal resection do snare , cut part adenoma piece piece whole adenoma resect . This technique standard therapy , require large adenoma , often show cell alteration indicate cancer . Therefore adenomas resect one piece . This do so-called en-bloc resection . For kind therapy , different endoscopic knife use cut adenoma whole . Both resection technique do usually previous injection saline liquid elevate lesion bottom tissue . Although piecemeal resection large adenoma standard therapy , show recurrence rate 10 25 % , afford repeat therapy follow control . En-bloc resection , though , expect less recurrence rate much complex perform . They high complication rate especially West , bee introduce couple year ago . The data situation regard safety efficacy therapy low . This study first one ever compare piecemeal EMR ESD randomize way .

	<brief_title>Piecemeal Versus En Bloc Resection Large Rectal Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 20 35 % colonoscopy due symptom prevention polyp , so-called adenoma , find . Currently , colonoscopy best way detect bowel tumor polyps , since biopsied remove one work process . If size adenoma large 2 cm , resection usually do hospital setting . Foremost flat adenoma , resection snare piece piece , so-called piecemeal polypectomy , piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) , state art . Resection usually follow submucosal saline injection ( saline assist polypectomy ) . Recurrences occur 10 25 % , require reapplication endoscopic therapy follow examination . Depending size adenoma , increase amount cell alteration advance stage high grade dysplasia / intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGIN ) early cancer find . In case , histo-pathological oncological reason , resection solitary manner ( en-bloc resection ) necessary evaluate completeness resection properly . Also , former study show recurrence rate could decrease considerably en-bloc resection , since aim perform complete resection basally laterally . New endoscopic technique en-bloc resection introduce since couple year , use several endoscopic knife cut adenoma submucosal injection liquid consecutively dissect tissue underneath . This technique mostly call endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , , large adenoma , combine snare resection , . The complexity method though much large snare resection . Therefore , western success rate considerably less Japan , develop first , high number case exist upper GI tract well low GI tract . All , complication rate en-bloc resection high snare resection . Those complication , mostly perforation , endoscopically controllable case , though . In comparison Japan , Korea China , early malign lesion oft upper GI tract West rare . Therefore , study conduct ( colo ) rectal lesion , appear much often West . All , efficacy ( resection total , number recurrence ) risk ( perforation ) , indistinct data situation piecemeal resection ( EMR ) en-bloc resection ( ESD ) . Up , randomise compare data exist . The plan study first randomise study ESD piecemeal EMR , since study do upper GI tract , either . For reason complexity , ESD conceivably remain method specialized center , piecemeal polypectomy do numerous hospital . Therefore , outcome study influence future logistics polypectomy flow patient large colorectal adenoma . Piecemeal resection do snare follow mark submucosal injection saline equivalent liquid . Small leftover adenoma tissue resect thoroughly snare forceps . High resolution endoscope mandatory . After three month , Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) therapy follow piecemeal resection , necessary , another resection leftover adenoma do . This second session do sigmoidoscopy . En- bloc resection do mark use different customary endoscopic knife include combine device hybrid knife cut lesion . After submucosal injection liquid ( saline equivalent ) elevate tissue dissect remove snare adequate size solitarily . Since aim method total resection basally laterally , one session intend . Follow-up care : sigmoidoscopy 6 18 month , colonoscopy 36 month end primary therapy session ( ) . Diagnostics do endoscopically histologically least 6 biopsy size lesion 3 cm , least 10 biopsy large lesion .</detailed_description>
