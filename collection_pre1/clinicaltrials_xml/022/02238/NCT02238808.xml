	<brief_summary>Some breast cancer estrogen receptor ( ER+ ) . The investigator know ER+ tumour cure hormone therapy alone ER+ breast cancer . Currently , perfect way tell group apart investigator know respond others . Research find suggest two type ER+ breast cancer differ response estrogen estrogen toxic one type . For tumours find estrogen toxic , may explain tumour start grow estrogen level decrease menopause . The purpose study see whether two-week treatment estrogen equal pre-menopausal estrogen level decrease rate patient ' ER+ tumour grow . This do compare growth rate tissue remove standard care surgery patient treat 7-14 day estrogen prior surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer heterogeneous disease include two ER+ genetic subtypes ( luminal A luminal B ) differ response treatment . Results Women 's Health Initiative Trial show estrogen treat hysterectomized woman prior history breast cancer significant persistent decrease breast cancer incidence compare placebo treated participant . This imply ER+ breast cancer fact growth inhibit estrogen growth promote . The hypothesis study ER+ breast cancer ( luminal A ) actually sensitive ( growth inhibit ) estrogen . Objectives : 1 . To assess change breast cancer proliferation 7-14 day trial estradiol newly diagnose estrogen receptor positive post-menopausal breast cancer patient prior surgery . 2 . Exploratory analysis biologic correlate comparison available genotyping test . This open-label single group assignment pilot study safety/efficacy exploratory biologic correlate</detailed_description>
