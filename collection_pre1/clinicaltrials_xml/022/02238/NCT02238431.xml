	<brief_summary>Currently patient freeze-all ICSI treatment cycle start FET cycle schedule use OCP . While excellent pregnancy rate ( 75 % ) patient blastocyst transfer maintain time , 15 % start FET cycle cancel premature luteinization , treatment ( transfer ) take approximately 89 day . The use Lucrin depot may reduce number cycle cancel reduce treatment time approximately 69 day . The use drug allow normal menstrual cycle determine time start FET cycle may suit patient . Whether benefit obtain still maintain current FET pregnancy rate main focus trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient undergo standard assist conception procedure ; control ovarian stimulation ( COS ) , oocyte pickup procedure ( OPU ) , ICSI , embryo culture , blastocyst vitrification frozen embryo transfer . If sufficient ( &gt; 2 ) viable blastocyst develop vitro culture embryo , viable blastocyst cryopreserved use routine vitrification procedure . This eligible patient population . On day last blastocyst ( ) frozen patient give opportunity ask question satisfy ask complete trial consent . At point patient randomize numeric code give schedule drug prescription schedule start hormone supplement frozen embryo transfer cycle . During scheduling period patient follow drug prescription provide . After completion treatment - transfer one two vitrified-warmed blastocyst - patient group receive identical luteal support drug schedule prescription . A blood test perform 15th day progesterone supplementation , determine βhCG blood concentration . Currently Antalya IVF , approximately 75 % patient blastocyst transfer frozen embryo transfer cycle positive biochemical pregnancy test , &gt; 29 international unit per litre ( IU/L ) human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) . If pregnant , patient continue use estrogen progesterone supplementation 8 week . At 7 week gestation ( 5 week embryo transfer ) patient receive transvaginal ultrasound scan ( TVUS ) check pregnancy viability ( fetal sac cardiac activity ) . Thereafter patient regular TVUS follow fetal development . At 20 week gestation TVUS perform confirm ongoing pregnancy ( normal fetal development ) . All drug pack deliver clinic pharmacy receive prescription . A staff member verify code prescription randomization code allocate patient . The pack give patient verbally confirm patient identity . The pack also contain drug use instruction sheet trial information sheet .</detailed_description>
