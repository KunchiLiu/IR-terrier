	<brief_summary>It demonstrate ligament , cardinal uterosacral contain considerable amount autonomic nerve tissue . The resection deep infiltrating endometriotic nodule level uterosacral ligament rectovaginal space suppose damage supply autonomic nerve fiber low urinary tract . The bladder receive motor sensitive innervation sympathetic fiber , arise hypogastric plexus nerve , parasympathetic fiber , arise pelvic splanchnic nerve inferior hypogastric plexus ; therefore , even bladder function may impair woman affected deep endometriosis . Very data publish regard urodynamic functional evaluation bladder patient deep endometriosis.So far , unknown surgery cause postoperative bladder dysfunction surgery unmasks subclinically pre-existing detrusor pathology . Since urinary postoperative complication strong impact quality life deep endometriosis patient often require management ( due poor spontaneous remission ) , crucial well understanding problem . That help appropriate pre-operative counselling . Aims study evaluate bladder function deep endometriosis surgery , use standardize validated instrument correlate localisation endometriosis lesion , type/area surgical dissection postoperative bladder function . This prospective multicenter cohort study involve Department General Gynaecology Gynecological Oncology Medical University Vienna ( Austria ) Department Obstetrics Gynaecology Insubria University , Varese ( Italy ) . A total 50 patient plan include . The study protocol consider Preoperative Assessment ( clinical examination , transvaginal pelvic ultrasound , preoperative specific questionnaire include obstetric , medical , surgical history standardized question pelvic floor dysfunction , standardize instrumental assessment pelvic floor ) Intraoperative Assessment ( laparoscopy , localization endometriotic lesion record identified anatomical site , number , depth infiltration ) . Before 3 month surgery Urodynamic assessment plan .</brief_summary>
