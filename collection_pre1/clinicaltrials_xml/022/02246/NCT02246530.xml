	<brief_title>Non-Surgical Treatment Rotator-Cuff Tears Using Platelet-Rich-Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based literature clinical practice , majority rotator cuff tear continue progress surgical correction despite conservative measure . These include physical therapy , medication management minimally invasive procedure subacromial bursa injection intra-articular injection steroid . Recently popular treatment common musculoskeletal injury ( include tendinopathies ) emerge throughout US utilize worldwide many year good empiric evidence know Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) injection . In partnership UAB Orthopedics Radiology , UAB Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation aim compare PRP corticosteroid injection patient partial rotator cuff tear tendinopathy . Outcome measure ultrasound imaging , pain disability course 6 month .</detailed_description>
