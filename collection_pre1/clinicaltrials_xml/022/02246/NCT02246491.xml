	<brief_summary>This research do well understand cause disease Ataxia-Telangiectasia , longer-term , develop new therapy disease use stem cell . Induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) type cell make laboratory cell body , blood cell skin cell ( fibroblast ) . These stem cell use research purpose . For example , stem cell use investigate mutation ATM cause actual symptom Ataxia-Telangiectasia . In addition , stem cell use screen drug could helpful treat disease develop new laboratory technique correct mutation cause Ataxia-Telangiectasia . mutation cause disease correct investigator . The stem cell generate study use directly patient therapy therefore research direct benefit . However , help advance understanding disease develop future therapy . Patients enroll study get standard therapy would get tumor whether participate study . There extra different therapy give . The study involve one-time procedure ( either blood collection skin biopsy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cell-Based Approaches For Modeling Treating Ataxia-Telangiectasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ataxia-Telangiectasia ( A-T ) devastate genetic syndrome neurodegeneration , immunodeficiency cancer predisposition cause mutation locus encode ATM ( Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated ) . The current standard care A-T consist aggressive supportive measure , prognosis remain poor . There therefore press need develop novel experimental approach treatment disease . In application , propose address need develop first time human stem cell-based technology : 1 ) generate novel experimental model A-T faithfully recapitulate feature disease across complex spectrum clinical manifestation ( Aim 1 ) ; 2 ) start test feasibility regenerative therapy A-T , via generation autologous stem cell render disease-free correction mutation ( Aim 2 ) . Mutations cause A-T private , result variable reduction ATM activity , correspondingly , wide spectrum clinical manifestation . Although severe form disease ( `` classical '' A-T , detectable ATM ) model mouse ( ATM `` knock '' ) , approach fails recapitulate neurological symptom disease characteristic tumor spectrum . Moreover , currently lack experimental model patient whose mutation result reduce ATM activity ( `` variant '' A-T ) . To address issue , experiment Aim 1 test hypothesis genotype-phenotype correlation A-T maintain patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) . To test hypothesis , reprogram fibroblast A-T patient variable reduction ATM level determine whether : 1 ) ATM expression activity iPSCs correlate directly observe patient fibroblast derive ; 2 ) iPSCs recapitulate phenotype observe fibroblast , include impaired cell cycle checkpoint activation , defective DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) repair , radiosensitivity genomic instability ; 3 ) phenotype iPSCs directly correlate level ATM expression/activity . If find genotype-phenotype correlation maintain A-T iPSCs , work would validate general use autologous iPSCs preclinical study A-T , include evaluation disease biomarkers , drug test genetic screening . The clinical manifestation A-T result progressive cell loss tissue degeneration , make A-T candidate disease regenerative therapy . Experiments Aim 2 test hypothesis correction ATM mutation A-T somatic cell rescue severe reprogramming defect allow generation disease-free iPSCs . To test hypothesis , propose series proof-of-principle experiment use well-characterized compound heterozygous A-T fibroblast cell line . First , `` repair '' either one two ATM mutation line recombination exogenous donor plasmid carry intact sequence , generate either `` carrier '' ( one normal allele one mutate allele ) `` intact '' cell ( two normal allele ) . To increase efficiency recombination , introduce DSB close proximity mutation use Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases ( TALENS ) bind specifically mutate region . In Preliminary Experiments , find successfully induce DSBs site-specific recombination human `` safe harbor '' locus well ATM locus . After verify recombination restores ATM expression function , reprogram correct cell iPSCs characterize level ATM expression , activity function passage . Because `` null '' , `` carrier '' `` intact '' line isogenic , effect ATM gene dose reprogramming iPSC function evaluate experiment . In regard , approximately 1 % US general population A-T `` carrier '' , extend significance work well beyond A-T patient . Overall , completion Exploratory Project provide rationale , expertise reagent longer-term study aim model treat A-T autologous iPSCs and/or derive product optimize use regenerative therapy general population .</detailed_description>
