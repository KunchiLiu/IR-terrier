Patients localize muscleinvasive disease ( cT1 , cN0 , M0 ) time initial diagnosis progress superficial disease ( cT2 ) systemic chemotherapy treat upfront radical cystectomy . PriorTURBT intravesical therapy allow do within one week CTC measurement . If patient find evidence tumor ( pT0 ) upon evaluation cystectomy specimen , patient drop . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 1 include Cohort 9 instead . Cohort 2 . Patients localize muscleinvasive disease ( cT1 , cN0 , M0 ) time initial diagnosis prior definitivechemoradiation . Prior TURBT intravesical therapy allow do within one week CTC measurement . If patient find evidence progression anyclinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient droppedfrom Cohort 2 include Cohort 9 instead . Cohort 3 . Patients localize muscleinvasive disease ( cT1 , cN0 , M0 ) time initial diagnosis progress superficial disease ( cT2 ) systemic chemotherapy treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Prior TURBT intravesical therapy allow do within one week CTC measurement . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 3 include Cohort 9 instead . Cohort 4 . Patients metastatic disease ( anyT , anyN , M1 ) initial presentation recurrent definitive treatment prior salvage systemic chemotherapy . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 4 include Cohort 9 instead . Cohort 5 . Patients newly diagnose nonmuscleinvasive bladder cancer ( T2 ) prior intravesical therapy . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop . Cohort 6 . Patients muscleinvasive bladder cancer radical cystectomy without perioperative systemic chemotherapy ( pT2 , anyN , M0 ) treat adjuvant radiation . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 6 includedin Cohort 9 instead . Cohort 7 . Patients history muscle invasive bladder cancer ( cT1 , N , M0 ) evidence disease least 2 year date radical cystectomy . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 7 may consider inclusion Cohort 4 . Cohort 8 . Patients history muscle invasive bladder cancer ( cT1 , N , M0 ) evidence disease least 2 year completion definitive chemoradiation . If patient find evidence progression clinical evaluation perform within 2 month posttreatment sample , patient drop Cohort 8 may consider inclusion Cohort 4 . Cohort 9 . Patients initially include Cohorts 16 find progression time posttreatment blood draw . Of note , patient may include one cohort time long inclusion exclusion criterion meet .
