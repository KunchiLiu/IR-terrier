	<brief_title>RESveratrol To Improve Outcomes oldeR pEople With PAD ( RESTORE Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eight million men woman United States low extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . PAD expect increasingly common population survive long chronic disease . Patients PAD great functional impairment faster functional decline compare without PAD . However , currently two FDA approve medication improve functional performance patient PAD . Furthermore , FDA approve medication modestly beneficial improve walk performance patient PAD . Emerging evidence , include pilot data , demonstrate calf skeletal muscle mitochondrion dysfunction contribute functional impairment people PAD . Resveratrol , polyphenol natural supplement , pharmacological property target specific mitochondrial impairment associate functional impairment old people PAD . Animal model preliminary human evidence show resveratrol protect ischemia-reperfusion injury , reduce inflammation , improve endothelial dysfunction . Ischemia-reperfusion injury , inflammation , endothelial dysfunction present people PAD contribute adverse outcome PAD . We propose pilot study 66 PAD participant age 65 older : double-blind , randomize control pilot clinical trial provide preliminary data address hypothesis resveratrol significantly improve low extremity function people PAD improve calf skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism , increase calf skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis , improve systemic endothelial function old people PAD . In primary specific aim , determine 1 ) whether PAD participant randomize resveratrol 500 mgs daily achieve great increase less decline six-minute walk performance 6-month follow-up , compare randomize placebo 2 ) whether PAD participant randomize resveratrol 125 mgs daily achieve great increase less decline six-minute walk performance 6-month follow-up , compare randomized placebo . In secondary aim , determine whether PAD participant randomize resveratrol improve treadmill walk performance , increase calf muscle biopsy-measured mitochondrial function , increase calf muscle biopsy-measured mitochondrial biogenesis , improve brachial artery flow-mediated dilation six-month follow-up , compare randomize control . For secondary specific aim , participant randomize 500 mg resveratrol ( N=22 ) compare randomize placebo ( N=20 ) participant randomize 125 mg resveratrol ( N=22 ) compare randomize placebo ( N=22 ) , respectively . In exploratory specific aim , determine whether participant randomize resveratrol 125 mg ( N=22 ) great improvement study outcome compare randomize resveratrol 500 mg ( N=22 ) . If hypothesis correct , result use design large , definitive randomize control trial resveratrol therapy improve low extremity function prevent mobility loss large grow number old people disable PAD . By study two dos resveratrol , result also provide guidance optimal dose resveratrol use large definitive trial .</detailed_description>
