	<brief_title>Comparison Of The Embryoscope Time-Lapse System With Standard Embryo Culture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number IVF center around world convert standard embryology practice , embryos embryologist manually processed culture , so-called `` embryoscopes , '' embryo culture perform automate incubation system time lapse photography . Manufacturers system ( investigator use system ) claim availability 24-hour time-lapse photographic control improve embryo selection , therefore , IVF pregnancy rate . They also claim use system save laboratory personnel time . The FDA far , therefore , approve sale least 2 system In USA . ( ) Our analysis publish literature fail find study support claim utilization equipment really improve pregnancy rate IVF ; ( ii ) Investigators concern CHR 's highly adversely select patient population may demonstrate different utilization outcome standard patient population , especially since equipment usually utilized culture embryo blastocyst stage ( day 5/6 ) , CHR culture patient day-3 . Investigators , therefore , contact manufacturer first FDA approve system , explain concern . The manufacturer agree loan u one system 4-months long study free charge ( CHR pay nominal amount installation training cost ) financially responsible supply . During 4 month , CHR perform open-label prospective ( register ) randomize clinical trial , investigator , base computerized randomization , assign CHR patient ( agree participate inform write consent ) , either standard embryology `` embryoscope '' embryology . Recruiting approximately 30 patient per month study anticipate , would give u population ~n=60 study group . Patient excessive number egg retrieve ( &gt; 12 ) exclude since purpose study investigate utility system relatively adversely select patient population . All patient offer participation . The study primary end point time analysis laboratory manpower , time spent patient embryologist record compare secondary end point IVF cycle outcome , define number good quality embryo available transfer , implantation rate clinical pregnancy rate .</detailed_description>
