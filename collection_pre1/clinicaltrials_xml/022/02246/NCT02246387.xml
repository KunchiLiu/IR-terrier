	<brief_summary>Native tissue repair pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) predominant surgical technique investigator department Manchester operation preferred procedure . The investigator long-term reoperation rate pevic organ prolapse low , documented investigator previous long-term follow-up study ( Oversand et al , International Urogynecology Journal 2013 ) , however data retrospective patient avulsion levator ani muscle identify . The investigator hypothesize correct fixation elevation vaginal apex , part three-compartment repair procedure , essential POP surgical repair , also treat woman levator ani avulsion . The purpose study : - prospectively evaluate cardinal/sacrouterine ligament plication ( part 3-compartment Manchester procedure ) give adequate elevation fixation vaginal apex . - ass change subjective symptom preoperative evaluation 1 5-year postoperative evaluation . - evaluate whether patient identify levator avulsion investigator population increase risk failure ( objectively subjectively ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many study show high recurrence rate POP surgical repair use native tissue technique , lead introduction synthetic mesh vaginal repair early 2000s . However use mesh recently put scrutiny due high risk complication , mesh exposure . The gran majority investigator patient operate native tissue repair , 60 % Manchester procedure , ligament plication essential part procedure . The investigator previous study document high patient satisfaction low risk recurrence , data available mainly collect retrospectively data available possible levator avulsion . Lateral defect cause avulsion levator ani muscle represent special sub-group amongst patient POP , show several study higher recurrence rate . There consensus best repair lateral defect POP , since prevalence levator avulsion patient POP show high , investigator find credible Manchester Operation give good result . The main justification study investigator already identify surgical technique document excellent result , study detail data quality need order well evaluate procedure 's advantage potential disadvantage . As use mesh vaginal surgery show unacceptable high risk new serious complication , international focus interest traditional native tissue repair optimize performance .</detailed_description>
