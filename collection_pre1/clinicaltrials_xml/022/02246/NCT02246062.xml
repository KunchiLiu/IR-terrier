	<detailed_description>Introduction Intense preoperative anxiety child associate difficulty anesthetic induction . In addition , anxiety relative factor great importance influence preoperative anxiety level child effectively contribute development behavioral change postoperative period . Distress surgery associate short- long-term consequence , include risk emergence delirium maladaptive postoperative behavior . Strategies decrease child 's anxiety provide suitable induction minimize risk . It estimate 40 % 75 % child undergoing surgery experience significant fear anxiety preoperative period3-5 Several author suggest child 4 year age great risk develop anxiety preoperatively . Among strategy reduce pediatric population anxiety , non-pharmacological approach alternative therapy act psychological aspect important pharmacological one 9 . Currently , great motivation towards non-pharmacological intervention aim anxiety relief child family , parental presence induction anesthesia ( PPIA ) , educational program prepare family , write information anesthetic procedure provide relative and/or child . This due part large growth outpatient practice increase participation presence parent child 's hospitalization , also new institutional strategy motivate humane medical practice . Furthermore , emerge efficient behavioral intervention program use toy , cartoon , video game smartphones . It suggest intuitive easeness use , popularity , smartphones way make child become absorbed scroll menu , play investigate function , hence make anesthesiologist ' approach trouble-free . Some author show use smartphone application electronic device part behavioral intervention program child , take account individual characteristic , may simple effective way reduce preoperative anxiety . Objectives The aim study determine whether quality information provide relative ward play age appropriate smartphone application may impact prevalence level child 's anxiety operating room ( OR ) induction anesthesia . Method After approval Research Ethics Committee Irmandade da Santa Casa de São Paulo , open randomize clinical trial conduct compare level anxiety child relatives , accord quality information use smartphone application receive preanesthetic period . Eighty-four child undergo elective surgical procedure relatives randomly select List Randomizer program ( www.random.org ) allocate four group : control group ( CG ) , relative receive conventional verbal information one day procedure ward ; informative group ( IG ) , relative , addition conventional verbal information , receive leaflet contain information anesthetic procedure one day surgery ward ; smartphone group ( SG ) , relative receive conventional verbal information one day procedure child receive smartphone application immediately enter operate room ; smartphone informative group ( SIG ) relative , addition conventional verbal information , receive leaflet contain information anesthetic procedure one day surgery child receive smartphone application immediately enter operate room . Developed author , leaflet consist 17 brief item , question answer , provide information regard frequently ask question relative , observe clinical practice . The content informative leaflet cover aspects specialty practice anesthesiology , suspension use medication , fasting , full stomach refeeding anesthesia , laboratory test , anesthesia child , type anesthesia , risk , induction recovery room , presence parent , contribute peaceful anesthesia child . Inclusion criterion ASA physical status I , II III , accord classification American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) , age 4 8 year , undergo minor-medium elective surgical procedure indication general anesthesia , shall receive premedication whose parent illiterate . The exclusion criterion child psychomotor deficit , use psychoactive drug , hear visual impairment , previous surgery ; relative , exclusion criterion illness mental disorder clinically recognize decline participate . The study begin always ward ( W ) , one day procedure , preanesthesia evaluation conventional provision information anesthesia . One researcher apply observational m-YPAS scale child relatives fully inform characteristic study ask sign consent form . At end preanesthetic evaluation ( APA ) relatives IG SIG group receive information leaflet . At day procedure , wait room ( WR ) surgical center , child take operating room ( OR ) , child anxiety assess m-YPAS scale . All group also answer sociodemographic questionnaire open statement satisfaction information receive . The child group SG SIG , take OR receive smartphones play , remain always accompany relative end induction . In OR , child undergo standard monitoring , immediately induction anesthesia conventional technique ( either intravenous inhalational ) , re-evaluated use m-YPAS ( OR time ) . Level prevalence child 's anxiety ( m-YPAS ) , measure three time : ward ( W ) , wait room ( WR ) operating room ( OR ) immediately induction . The observational m-YPAS use originally propose Kain et al . A partial score give domain , base score observe researcher , divide number category domain . The score domain add others multiply 20 . Cut-off score classify patient : without anxiety ( 23.4-30 ) , anxiety ( &lt; 30 ) . For sample size calculation , consider prevalence child 's anxiety operating room 75 % 23 propose intervention able reduce 35 % 15 . Thus , investigator propose use α-error 5 % , β-error 20 % , confidence interval 95 % , total 84 patient , 21 group .</detailed_description>
