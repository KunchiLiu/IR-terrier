	<detailed_description>The medication-refractory motor symptom medication-induced side effect advance Parkinson 's disease safely treated unilateral , stag subthalamotomy perform ExAblate Neuro Transcranial system . This stag approach perform subtherapeutic/test lesion first identify patient risk involuntary movement follow subthalamic ablation . Data collect establish basic safety clinical efficacy type treatment basis later study evaluate full clinical efficacy .</detailed_description>
