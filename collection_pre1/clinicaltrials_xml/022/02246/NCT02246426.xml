	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy SocialVille , online training program recently develop ( support Phase I SBIR award ) treat social cognition deficit evident schizophrenia ( DSM-IV ICD-9 Code 295.90 ) . SocialVille computerize , browser-playable program suite , design target information processing core social cognition domain deficit schizophrenia . It use internet-connected computer ; dedicate clinician portal , treat clinician register user treatment , continuously track monitor performance , coach user throughout training . The specific aim study : 1 . Specific Aim 1 : Evaluate efficacy SocialVille social cognition treatment individual schizophrenia . We conduct large-scale , multi-site , double-blind , randomize control clinical trial SocialVille medical device vs. active computer game control , approximate challenge , computer time interaction experimenter . This large trial conduct four site : University Minnesota Medical School ( site PI : Dr. Sophia Vinogradov ) , Greater Los Angeles VA ( Dr. Michael Green ) , Rush University ( Dr. Christine Hooker ) , University California , Los Angeles ( Drs . Joseph Ventura Keith Nuechterlein ) . Study participants complete 30 hour train home . At baseline , mid-way training immediately follow training , employ structure assessment battery co-primary SC performance measure co-primary functional performance measure , well secondary measure SC , functional capacity , functional outcome , motivation , quality life . 2 . Specific Aim 2 : Identify specific population treatment responder non-responders . We examine predictor SC gain base baseline participant demographic , symptom level , computer use , SC , functional measure , well learn rate plateau performance measure derive course SocialVille use determine possible identify specific population respond well SocialVille use , unlikely respond SocialVille use . 3 . Specific Aim 3 : Evaluate effect train relatively distinct low vs. high-level social cognition construct . We separately examine effect train independent SC factor low level social cue detection high-level inferential process , correlate clinical symptom functional outcome , respectively .</detailed_description>
