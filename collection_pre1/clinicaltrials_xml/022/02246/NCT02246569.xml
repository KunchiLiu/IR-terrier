	<brief_summary>For patient emphysema lung volume reduction ( ELVR ) could expedient approach reduction distension lung . ELVR may perform use RePneu® Coils . After insertion coil distend lung section shrink healthy part expand . In present study investigator intend examine , whether insertion coil improve diaphragm function force breathing muscle . Investigators hypothesize reduction lung volume eliminate reduces flatten diaphragm relief breathe muscle , respectively respiratory pump , aim reduce dyspnea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Volume Reduction Via Coils Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In line routine exploration necessary clarify whether patient suitable endoscopic lung volume reduction . To address question lung function diagnostics , 6-minutes-walk-test , blood withdrawal , CT thorax , lung perfusion scintigraphy transthoracic echocardiography perform . After confirmation suitability endoscopic lung volume reduction patient fulfill eligibility criterion educate aim performance study investigator . After read patient information patient may submit informed write consent . After information risk give treat physician . Following examination perform additional due study : determination strength breathe muscle , determination life quality index via St.-George-questionary determination depression score via SF-8-questionary ( short form-8 ) . After coil implanted permanent post-operative examination perform 24 hour . Three , respectively nine month implant follow exploration perform study patient .</detailed_description>
