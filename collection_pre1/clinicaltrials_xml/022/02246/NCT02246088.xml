	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) frequent chronic musculoskeletal pathology usually cause great disability significant healthcare cost . Substantial scientific evidence indicate role central sensitization OA pain . Pathophysiological mechanism underlie central sensitisation complex numerous , net effect amplification neural signal within CNS elicit pain hypersensitivity . Central sensitization management area great interest least subgroup patient OA pain . Reconceptualization pain Neuroscience Education ( NE ) intervention already use successfully chronic musculoskeletal pain condition characterize alteration CNS pain process central sensitization ( i.e . chronic low back pain , chronic fatigue syndrome , widespread pain chronic whiplash associate disorder ) . Moreover , clinical guide help clinician identify explain central sensitization NE , recently publish . However , kind intervention never test specifically chronic pain related OA . Preoperative education center biomedical model anatomy pathoanatomy well procedural information limit effect reduce postoperative pain total hip arthroplasty total hip arthroplasty surgery . Preoperative educational session aim increase patient knowledge pain science ( i.e . NE ) may effective manage postoperative pain . NE cognitive-based educational intervention aim reduce pain disability help patient gain increased understanding biological process underpin pain state . There compel evidence NE positive effect pain , disability , catastrophization physical performance chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder , yet study examine value NE OA patient essentially lack . Joint mobilization show useful modality reduce pain related osteoarthritis . Regarding knee joint , two recent systematic review demonstrate usefulness manual therapy exercise management knee OA . Moreover , Deyle et al report preliminary clinical prediction rule may help identify minority knee OA patient unlikely respond management approach . The primary aim study therefore assess effect NE pain , disability physical performance subject chronic OA knee pain wait replacement surgery . This first time NE address specifically OA pain . To investigate benefit NE pain related knee OA , effect manual therapy intervention combine NE ( MT+NE ) compare manual intervention plus educational program base traditional patho-anatomical biomedical model ( MT+E ) . The following secondary aim address well : - Examining effect two intervention mechanism central sensitization patient knee OA ; - Examining effect two intervention pain catastrophizing , illness perception kinesiophobia patient knee OA ; - Finally , aim identify effect moderator NE patient knee OA .</detailed_description>
