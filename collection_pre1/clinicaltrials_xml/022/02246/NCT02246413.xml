	<detailed_description>The large number primary care patient affect coexist obesity depression common risk factor diabetes heart disease underscore urgency develop effective , accessible , sustainable intervention use integrate , multicondition care management approach . The RAINBOW trial rigorously evaluate clinical cost effectiveness potential `` real-world '' implementation innovative intervention integrate behavioral weight loss program collaborative step care program depression , incorporate conventional clinic- home-based mode care delivery ( e.g. , office visit plus phone consults take-home DVD ) , leverage low-cost , wide-reach health information technology ( e.g. , Web , secure email , mobile texting ) . Beginning Jan 11 , 2016 , least 100 newly enrol trial participant also consent undergo additional assay evaluate neurobiological mechanism self-regulation , include emotional regulation , cognitive control self-reflection . Given focus transform primary care management obesity depression common cardiometabolic risk factor evidence-based , patient-centered care , well likely scalability propose intervention , study high potential significant clinical public health impact . Furthermore , elucidate neurobiological mechanism self-regulation significantly advance precision lifestyle medicine enable mechanism-targeted individualization treatment .</detailed_description>
