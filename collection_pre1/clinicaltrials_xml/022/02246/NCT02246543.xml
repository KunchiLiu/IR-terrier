	<brief_summary>This study primary aim investigate within-day change appetite consumption high-protein ( HP , 30 % calorie ) normal , low , protein ( LP , 15 % calorie ) whey protein meal , solid liquid form , appetite ad libitum food intake . Secondary objective ass statistical relationship plasma concentration gut hormone visual analogue scale ( subjective hunger fullness ) transit time . In order investigate interaction food structure protein content appetite , require , practice , either differ amount ( g ) calorie ( kJ ) load function energy density ( defined kJ/100g ) . Delivering test meal solid liquid form give easy solution achieve manipulation without compromise nutritional profile . Following decision , easy produce different preloads use whey protein ( rather meat protein ) , since easily incorporate test meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomized crossover design 10 overweight/obese ( BMI 26-40 ) men 10 lean men ( BMI 18.5-25 ) . The control water . Each subject attend HNU six separate occasion . The five test meal challenge involve subject attend Human Nutrition Unit ( HNU ) morning , overnight fast . The total time test meal visit approximately 4Â½hours . They provide standardised meal , blood sample collect first 2hrs . The following five treatment test : Treatment 1 Control - Water + Egg Yolk Mixture + 13C Octanoic Acid Treatment 2 HPL ( High Protein Liquid ) : 30 % protein ; 30 % fat 40 % carbohydrate ( CHO ) Treatment 3 LPL ( Low Protein Liquid ) : 15 % protein ; 30 % fat 55 % CHO Treatment 4 HPS ( High Protein Solid ) : 30 % protein ; 30 % fat 40 % CHO Treatment 5 LPS ( Low Protein Solid ) : 15 % protein ; 30 % fat 55 % CHO Test meal fix nutritional composition participant . The liquid meal milk/fruit smoothie mixture 'solid ' milk jelly ( set ) form . Ad libitum pasta meal : 15 % protein ; 30 % fat 55 % CHO homogenous mix energy density around 400kJ/100g - serve excess individual 600g portion 'help-yourself ' . Subjective average appetite measure ( every 30 min visual analogue scale ) 4hr ad libitum food intake measure 4hr treatment consumption . Ad libitum lunch homogenous pasta meal tomato sauce bottle water . Blood sample collect every 10 min first half hour , every 15 min second half hour every 30mins subsequently . The breath gastric empty measurement assess use 13Carbon ( 13C ) Octanoic Acid stable isotopic technique19 . This involve mix tracer food take breath sample measure isotope ratio mass spectrometry . 13C Octanoic acid medium chain fatty acid rapidly absorbed duodenum metabolise liver . Following oxidation , result Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) excrete breath ( 12 sample collect 4hr test day ) .</detailed_description>
