	<detailed_description>Eating saturate fat show decrease many calorie individual burn increase chronic disease risk increase inflammation , coagulation ( blood clot ) potential , blood pressure , cholesterol . Conversely , eat poly-unsaturated fat link decrease risk chronic disease . The goal study determine whether eat diet contain lot poly-unsaturated fat compensate damaging effect eat occasional high-fat meal high saturate fat . Those damaging effect interested study include much fat calorie person 's body burn , measure marker chronic disease risk blood ( inflammation marker blood clot marker ) .</detailed_description>
