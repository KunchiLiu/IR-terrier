	<brief_summary>Environmental toxin exert damage health effect worker . Thousands responder work volunteered World Trade Center ( WTC ) rescue recovery effort follow September 11 , 2001 attack suffer health condition may increase risk worsen health . In pilot study , investigator identify first evidence kidney damage subject high exposure Ground Zero . Specifically , note preliminary association intensity particulate matter exposure albuminuria , marker early chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , systemic endothelial dysfunction , increase cardiovascular risk . The long-term goal minimize risk CKD cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) among individual expose inhaled toxin . The primary objective research quantify risk kidney damage among first responder WTC attack determine relationship particulate matter exposure well determine association renal cardiovascular damage first responder explore potential mechanism . The central hypothesis exposure inhale particulate matter cause systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction result chronic kidney cardiovascular damage . This hypothesis investigate subgroup participant previously conduct NIOSH-funded study `` Pulmonary Function Abnormalities , Diastolic Dysfunction WTC Exposure : Implications Diagnosis Treatment '' ( `` WTC-CHEST , '' PI Mary Ann McLaughlin ) . The propose study capitalize unique resource WTC-CHEST , include standardize collection data particulate matter exposure share risk factor CKD cardiovascular disease , cardiopulmonary function test . The output proposal anticipate broad impact understand health effect inhale particulate matter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . To quantify risk kidney damage relationship particulate matter exposure among first responder WTC attack . Urine sample collect 2 occasion albumin creatinine . The investigator define clinically relevant albuminuria UACR â‰¥30 mg/g . If , hypothesize , investigator find albuminuria common among WTC responder , simple non-invasive measure may useful monitor program identify responder increase risk adverse outcome . eGFR calculate use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Consortium ( CKD-EPI ) equation . Specific Aim 2 . To examine relationship kidney damage cardiac structure function among first responder WTC attack . Cardiovascular Disease Risk Screening In order identify independent relationship CKD cardiac dysfunction , investigator comprehensively evaluate potential confounders . Participants undergo evaluation traditional CVD risk factor account Framingham Risk Score Reynold 's score ( medical history , medication use baseline risk CVD : smoking status , family history premature coronary disease , blood pressure , heart rate , height , weight , waist , hip neck circumference ) . Laboratory evaluation include : lipid panel , complete blood count , HbA1C , serum creatinine cystatin C. Standard questionnaires chest pain , shortness breath , depression , sleep apnea stress , IPSS . Specific Aim 3 . To explore potential mechanism kidney cardiovascular damage among first responder WTC attack . An establish marker systemic inflammation , serum hsCRP , measure participant . Flow-mediated dilatation , validate non-invasive measure endothelial function , measure subgroup participant . Heavy metal assay perform compare participant without evidence kidney damage ( albuminuria decrease eGFR ) proximal tubular dysfunction .</detailed_description>
