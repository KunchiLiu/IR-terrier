	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose colorectal cancer routinely undergo CT scan identify whether cancer spread part body , diagnosis secondary cancer liver difficult use conventional CT. MRI know well CT diagnose cancer liver take long time . Recently suggest limited MRI liver identify cancer liver , however yet proven effective patient new diagnosis colorectal cancer . The purpose study test whether quick MRI scan liver time colorectal cancer diagnose identify cancer spread liver conventional CT. All patient diagnose high risk type colorectal cancer liver metastases CT eligible take part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Everyone agrees take part short specialist MRI scan , call diffusion weight MRI , look cancer liver . Normally scan within 4 week join study . You able start cancer treatment study scan delay start treatment . If diffusion weight MRI scan liver abnormal ask return another MRI scan liver , time injection contrast scan , establish whether cancer liver . If scan positive cancer doctor discuss best method treat colorectal cancer cancer liver , may include additional chemotherapy , radiotherapy another operation . We also want find quality life ; therefore ask fill short questionnaire one year two year join study . All participant follow doctor , per standard . There follow visit specifically study although carefully monitor progress three year .</detailed_description>
