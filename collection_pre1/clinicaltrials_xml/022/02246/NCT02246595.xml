	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria screening : 1 . Male female patient &gt; = 18 year old 2 . Written inform consent 3 . Occurrence least two criterion systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) explain reason . These criterion present within 12 hour prior screen 4 . Suspected confirm abdominal pulmonary infection screen 5 . Broad spectrum i.v . antimicrobial therapy treat abdominal pulmonary infection 6 . At least one follow acute organ dysfunction due sepsis . Each organ dysfunction must occur within 12 hour prior screen , mainly explain disease process sepsis judge investigator cause directly relate abdominal pulmonary infectious focus : 1. respiratory 2. renal 3. hematologic 4. metabolic 5. cardiovascular ( occur within last three hour ) 7 . Reasonable likelihood administration study drug start within 3.5 hour start screen process Key Exclusion Criteria screening : 1 . Sepsis primary cause pulmonary abdominal source 2 . Weight &gt; 130 kg screen 3 . Any disease condition likely interfere evaluation study product , outcome assessment satisfactory conduct study 4 . Patients receive follow concomitant medication within 14 day prior screen : 1 . Calcineurin inhibitor ( e.g. , ciclosporine , tacrolimus ) 2 . Proliferation inhibitor ( e.g. , everolimus , sirolimus ) 3 . Antimetabolites ( e.g. , mycophenolate , mycophenolic acid , azathioprine ) 4 . High dose corticosteroid ( e.g. , &gt; 50mg prednisolon per day equivalent ) 5 . Patients receive high dose immunoglobulin within 3 month prior screen 6 . Patients follow abnormal laboratory result : Neutrocytopenia neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm3 unless likely due sepsis 7 . General criterion : 1 . Pregnant ( woman childbearing potential urine pregnancy test perform ) breastfeed woman 2 . Women childbearing potential ( define within two year last menstruation ) willing practice appropriate contraceptive measure ( e.g. , implanon , injection , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , partner vasectomy , abstinence ) participate trial 3 . Participation interventional clinical trial within last three month 4 . Prior participation clinical trial 5 . Patient chronically bedbound prior onset sepsis 6 . Known intravenous drug abuse 7 . Employee study site , spouse/partner relative study staff ( e.g. , investigator , subinvestigators , study nurse ) relationship sponsor 8 . No commitment full aggressive life support ( e.g. , resuscitate order ) Inclusion Criteria randomisation : 1 . At least one sepsis relate organ dysfunction detect screen still present 2 . Current treatment broad spectrum i.v . antibiotic start ongoing Exclusion Criteria randomisation : 1 . Time frame detection non cardiovascular organ dysfunction start randomization procedure 15 hour 2 . Time frame detection cardiovascular organ dysfunction start randomization six hour 3 . Organ dysfunction unlikely persistent next three hour</criteria>
