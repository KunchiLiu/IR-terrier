	<brief_summary>Inpatient treatment complicate severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) continue high mortality Africa . This partly child commonly bring admission seriously ill , rather bring hospital malnutrition alone . Mortality rate especially high SAM complicate HIV TB . The early phase inpatient nutritional treatment severe acute malnutrition base low-protein milk know F75 , give improve metabolic homeostasis prior re-feeding achieve catch-up growth . F75 provide high proportion energy carbohydrate , include sucrose , lactose maltodextrin . However , malabsorption different type carbohydrate , lactose particular , know occur SAM may lead osmotic diarrhoea . Diarrhoea common child SAM associate increased mortality . Furthermore , switch catabolic state high energy diet consist predominantly carbohydrate lead 're-feeding syndrome ' may lead severe electrolyte abnormality multiple organ dysfunction . The aim trial determine whether reduce carbohydrate content F75 , remove lactose , improve stabilisation severely malnourish child . The trial involve randomise child eligible receive F75 milk either current formulation revise formulation . Both formulation give accord current recommendation regard frequency feed caloric value . Since purpose F75 stabilise child metabolically biochemically , primary endpoint trial time stabilisation ( end first phase treatment severe acute malnutrition ) . Blood stool sample admission three day use determine effect carbohydrate fat malabsorption evidence re-feeding syndrome . Children follow discharge hospital . The project plan consultation World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , revise formulation F75 result improve outcomes , lead global change recommendation formulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Admission hospital complicate severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) Africa commonly case fatality 10-30 % . Importantly , child usually admit hospital severely ill rather malnutrition alone . Mortality may improve extent adherence WHO recommend management , direct application guideline contexts controversial . The WHO guideline design basis historical data nutrient requirement medical treatment almost none recommendation support evidence clinical trial . For treatment complicate inpatient SAM , guideline consist three distinct phase treatment : phase 1 stabilization phase low protein , liquid diet ( F75 ) introduce reduce energy intake ( 80-100 kcal/kg/day ) . Once child stabilise , 'transition phase ' consist either ready use therapeutic food ( RUTF ) supplemental F75 alternatively another milk formula know F100 . RUTF peanut base , energy dense supplement use obtain catch-up growth . F100 liquid formula high energy density protein content F75 . The caloric intake increase daily maximum 130 kcal/kg/day . Finally , 'Phase 3 ' recovery phase aim achieve catch-up growth either RUTF F100 . Typically , high mortality rate find early phase treatment . Children fail treatment early often profuse diarrhoea , sign circulatory insufficiency hard treat . The recent report Zambia Kenya note prevalence diarrhoea 60 % amongst child SAM associate increased mortality . Currently Kilifi County Hospital Coast Provincial General Hospital , ~20 % child give either dilute lactose-free milk feed rehabilitation SAM , although specific guideline . Diarrhoea may cause viral bacterial gastroenteritis , sepsis , may nutritionally induce ( osmotic ) . There routinely available test distinguish osmotic infective cause diarrhoea hospital sub-Saharan Africa . The proportion energy derive carbohydrate F75 high . The carbohydrate F75 milk ( well F100 RUTF ) consist mixture maltodextrin , sucrose lactose . Disaccharides maltose , lactose sucrose normally hydrolyse monosaccharide disaccharidase localize tip small intestinal villus . The monosaccharide glucose galactose transport across apical membrane Na+ dependent glucose transporter , whilst fructose make use facilitative fructose transporter . There limited information intestinal function intestinal carbohydrate absorption malnourish child . However , data Jamaica South Africa suggest impaired absorption disaccharide ( lactose sucrose ) , regardless presence suspicion gastroenteritis . Limited histological evidence show intestinal atrophy child SAM . These data consistent clinical sign lactose malabsorption find child severe malnutrition . Recently , evidence impaired absorption monosaccharide glucose child SAM report Malawi . Apart diarrhoea , early deterioration may also relate severe metabolic derangement due sudden change catabolic anabolic state , result refeeding syndrome . Refeeding syndrome characterize hypophosphataemia , hypokalaemia , hypomagnesaemia sodium retention . These severe electrolyte disturbance lead impaired cardiac , pulmonary neurological function often hard treat . By receive energy predominantly sugar , pancreatic insulin secretion increase induces uptake electrolyte include phosphate potassium , cell . Furthermore , protein synthesis stimulate , increased production adenosine tri-phosphate ( ATP ) lead high cellular demand phosphate . Although insulin secretion appear partially impaired early stage refeeding , hypophosphatemia common feature refeeding malnourished child , associate mortality . In trial , investigator aim evaluate outcome use revise formulation F75 milk reduce carbohydrate composition without lactose , compare current formulation F75 initial stabilisation period amongst child severe acute malnutrition . In new formulation , provide lipid total energy provide unchanged . The trial undertaken two hospital Kenya one hospital Malawi . Enrolment follow complete December 2015 , laboratory analysis plasma faecal sample ongoing .</detailed_description>
