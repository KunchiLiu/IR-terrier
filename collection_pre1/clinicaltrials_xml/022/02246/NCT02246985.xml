	<brief_summary>Carotenoids family pigment find abundantly fruits vegetable . They responsible colour many fruit vegetable tomato , melon , pepper orange colour fruit vegetable . Carotenoids beta-carotene important human body precursor vitamin A . They also think important anti-oxidants may help protect cancer heart disease . Although many food rich source carotenoid poor bioavailability often limit amount absorb available metabolism human . Devising practical way mean increase carotenoid bioavailability could lead good health outcome . Processed food widely eat many , taste convenience . No study thus far looked bioavailability carotenoid add process food . Thus purpose study investigate bioavailability carotenoid incorporate process food product ( bread mayonnaise ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carotenoids diverse group natural-occurring fat-soluble pigment . Whilst 600 different type characterise around 20 find human tissue postprandial state , however , 90 % absorbed carotenoid make 6 specific type ( alpha-Carotene , beta-carotene , Lycopene , Lutein , Zeaxanthin Cryptoxanthin ) There good evidence suggest carotenoid play notable role human health pro-vitamin activity biological antioxidant . Carotenoids believe responsible beneficial effect fruit vegetable prevent human chronic disease cancer cardiovascular disease . Increasing fruit vegetable intakes individual sometimes difficult unsustainable , therefore , increase bioavailability may effective alternative approach maximise health outcome . A notable number vegetable rich source carotenoid , however , amount available human body metabolism often small due poor bioavailability . For instance , study show bioavailability carotenoid carrot tomato low 1-3 % . The bioavailability carotenoid show depend factor source , degree cooking , processing , mechanical breakdown , presence fat interaction carotenoid . Whilst presence fat significantly increase carotenoid absorption , oil type , quantity form affect bioavailability . Recent work suggest carotenoid bioavailability improve fat present form mayonnaise rather plain oil . This may due emulsion property mayonnaise allow good solubilisation amphiphilic compound carotenoid . Mayonnaise also show miscible gastric juice ( compare plain oil ) may contribute great absorption carotenoid . The present study build upon previous work study carotenoid bioavailability process food system . Using bread-mayonnaise meal study compare carotenoid bioavailability incorporate either bread mayonnaise . Furthermore , study investigates impact mayonnaise bioavailability carotenoid incorporate process food ( bread ) . The study focus bioavailability three principle carotenoid find food , alpha-carotene , beta-carotene lycopene . Carrot tomato use source carotenoid . HYPOTHESIS Carotenoid bioavailability influence food matrix contain . OBJECTIVES 1 . To compare acute-phase bioavailability ( systemic gut absorption ) target carotenoid ( alpha-carotene , beta-carotene lycopene ) incorporate different process food matrix ( bread mayonnaise ) 2 . Study mayonnaise affect acute bioavailability carotenoid incorporate process food .</detailed_description>
