	<brief_title>Fractional Laser Assisted Delivery Anesthetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In dermatology , many minor surgical laser procedure carry local anesthesia skin . Anesthesia use topical formulation time consuming , anesthetic apply least one hour treatment , often partially effective . On hand infiltration anesthesia often associate discomfort tolerate patient example needle phobic . In past year , enhance accelerate penetration various topically applied substance , include photosensitizers , proven pretreatment skin fractional laser , create pattern microscopic ablation crater . ( Haedersdal et al. , 2010 ) This improvement drug penetration seem regardless ablation crater depth . ( Haak et al. , 2012 ) There limited evidence transdermal lidocaine absorption increase fractional laser pretreatment . ( Oni et al. , 2012 ; Oni et al. , 2013 ) These finding might suggest local anesthesia skin may achieve apply anesthetic drug topically skin surface pretreated fractional laser . However , little known role formulation topical drug deliver use method . Objective : The primary objective study assess analgesic effect fractional carbon dioxide laser assist delivery two topical anesthetic ( articaine hydrochloride 40 mg/ml epinephrine 10 μg/ml solution ( AHES ) EMLA cream ) compare application anesthetic without fractional laser pretreatment . The secondary objective compare efficacy two different anesthetic , apply accord fractional laser drug delivery principle . Study design : Prospective , single blind , randomize , control , within subject , pilot study . Study population : 10 healthy volunteer ≥18 year , give write informed consent Intervention : In subject , four test region subject 's back 1x1 centimeter randomly allocate 2x2 design ( 1 ) ablative fractional laser ( AFXL ) pretreatment ( 5 % density , 2.5 mJ/microbeam ) follow topical application AHES , ( 2 ) AFXL pretreatment follow application EMLA cream , ( 3 ) sham AFXL follow application AHES intact skin ( 4 ) sham AFXL follow application EMLA cream intact skin . Sham AFXL do deliver AFXL pas 5 % density 2.5 mJ/microbeam right adjacent region AHES EMLA application intact skin . After ten minute incubation time , AFXL pas give pain stimulus test region 5 % density 35 mJ/microbeam . Subjects ask indicate pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0-10 ( 0 : pain ; 10 : worst imaginable pain ) directly pain stimulus .</detailed_description>
