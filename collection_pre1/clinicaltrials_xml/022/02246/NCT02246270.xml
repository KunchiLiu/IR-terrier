	<brief_summary>Urinary Tract Infections ( UTIs ) second common infection body . UTIs account five percent visit primary care physician . UTIs less common men woman . Many woman UTI develop recur urinary tract infection . Recent study suggest woman suffer recurrent UTIs urinary tract allow bacteria adhere readily others . Women suffer bladder inflammation recurrent UTIs note reduced UTIs bladder inflammation heparin bladder instillation . Heparin highly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan store within secretory granule mast cell release vasculature sit tissue injury . It propose , addition anticoagulation , main purpose heparin defense sit invade bacteria foreign material . The central question research intend answer Heparin bladder instillation decrease UTI rate patient . Primary Objectives : The specific aim study 1 ) demonstrate Heparin bladder instillation reduce number UTI episodes ; 2 ) demonstrate Heparin bladder instillation increase median interval UTI ; 3 ) demonstrate Heparin bladder instillation decrease urine inflammatory ( NGAL ) level . Study Design : This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial subject treat documented recurrent urinary tract infection heparin bladder instillation versus sterile saline instillation . The study recruit woman ( n = 30 ) 3 UTI episode one year patient population OHSU randomly assign treatment usual care sterile saline instillation ( n =15 ) treatment usual heparin bladder instillation ( n = 15 ) . Subjects give 6 weekly bladder instillation interval follow-up ; primary outcome measure number UTI episodes six month study period survival analysis ass time next UTI . The usual care study antibiotic treatment UTI . Urine sample collect certain interval . Analysis : We seek statistically significant difference recurrent UTI rate 6 month heparin instillation sterile saline instillation group . Assuming Recurrent UTI rate sterile saline bladder instillation 2.3.3 UTI episode per six month , 35 % reduction recurrent UTI rate deem significant base previous literature . A sample size 30 ( 15 group ) achieve 60 % power detect 35 % reduction recurrent UTI rate 0.05 significance level . Allowing 25 % drop , total 30 subject require . Significance : Recurrent UTIs challenging manage , especially microbiological result equivocal . In woman suffer frequent recurrence , daily antibiotic use effective strategy recurrent UTI prevention compare daily cranberry pill , daily estrogen therapy , acupuncture . However even traditional approach continuous antibiotic 6 12 month , rate UTI reduce prophylaxis rate UTI unchanged stop antibiotic treatment . Increasing antibiotic resistance rate require immediate identification innovative alternative prophylactic therapy . The lack non-antibiotic therapy give opportunity develop innovative strategy decrease recurrent UTIs decrease burden UTIs . This study augment current evidence available aggregate effect treatment emphasize optimization antibiotic regimen non-antibiotic intervention .</brief_summary>
