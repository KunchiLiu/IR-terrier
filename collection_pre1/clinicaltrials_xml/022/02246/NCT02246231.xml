	<brief_summary>Patients Neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) almost always develop acoustic neuroma ear . As result tumour treatment tumour , many patient become profoundly deaf ear . It possible restore degree hear place hear implant brainstem adjacent hearing pathway within brain . This termed auditory brainstem implant ( ABI ) . The aim study find optimum head position relation MRI magnet field , would produce least area image distortion patient ABIs . This benefit optimise MR image future patient implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Auditory brainstem implant ( ABI ) place auditory centre brainstem possible implant cochlea cochlear nerve , conveys neural signal cochlea brainstem , damage absent . The latter device usually use patient Neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) develop bilateral benign inner ear tumour call vestibular schwannomas well neurological tumours1 . These patient often become bilaterally profoundly deaf either result disease surgery remove tumour require ABI . Patients NF2 require monitoring tumour . In absence auditory implant possible use magnetic resonance imaging . This gold standard image technique give excellent view soft tissue head . However , concern regard use MRI patient auditory implant recently potential problem demagnetisation magnet within implant , implant magnet displacement risk integrity implant electronics . In addition , magnet field implant magnet result image artefact ( manifest signal void ) around implant site limit information obtain .</detailed_description>
