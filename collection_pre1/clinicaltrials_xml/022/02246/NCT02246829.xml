	<brief_summary>Aflibercept ( EYLEA® ) induce rapid reduction central retinal thickness ( CRT ) patient suffer neovascular age-related-macular degeneration.1 This early dramatic reduction CRT already observe week 4 . Therefore might necessary consistently perform three monthly consecutive intravitreal injection so-called loading phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study ass whether retina patient dry first second intravitreal injection Aflibercept ( EYLEA® ) 2mg event , determine proportion patient The analysis characteristic could help identify morphotype would predict whether retina dry within first 3 month treatment . For patient early drying-up , third monthly injection might necessary 50 naïve patient include receive monthly injection 12 week biweekly follow-up . Morphological functional characteristic record visit analyze . The rate patient dry SD-OCT assess . The study include 7 visit . The visit schedule every 2-week basis baseline Week 12 . V1 ( baseline ) , V3 V5 , patient inject Aflibercept ( EYLEA® ) 2mg . In visit , visual acuity test , Fundus photography , SD-OCT , and/or Fluorescein Angiography perform</detailed_description>
