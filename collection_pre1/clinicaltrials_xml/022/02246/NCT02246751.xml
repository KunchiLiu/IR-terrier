	<brief_summary>Little known child cerebral palsy ( CP ) use sensory system ( touch , sense body position , balance organ inner ear , vision ) help achieve trunk control independent sit . If child CP achieve trunk control 4 year age prognosis motor skill development include walk poor . Clinical researcher The Movement Centre Oswestry , England develop method call Targeted Training child train trunk control small segment top use custom fit training device . This study aim examine child moderate severe CP use sensory information trunk control , program Targeted Training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One major challenge motor control understand central nervous system control degree freedom body . This particularly evident cerebral palsy ( CP ) , prevalent chronic childhood motor disability one disabling costly chronic disorder child adult . Deficits postural control sensorimotor integration hallmarks CP . Although postural control trunk independent sit creates foundation motor task , surprisingly little known child CP use sensory input guide development upright control ( occur typically develop infant 8 month age ) . This lack knowledge limit ability effectively assess treat child neuromotor deficit trunk control . The objective project identify sensory reliance sensory re-weighting study child moderate-to-severe CP ( 4-12 year age ) Targeted Training Trunk Control . A novel trunk support device enable test participant lack ( still develop ) stable sit . In experiment , kinematics head trunk measure . Sensory reliance re-weighting identified postural trunk response sensory conflict stimulus consist tilt visual surround and/or tilt surface participant sit upon . Generally , participant high reliance vestibular feedback remain upright respect gravity test ; whereas high reliance cutaneous visual feedback produce trunk sway away upright toward surface visual surround tilt , respectively . To tease apart biomechanical , physical , neurological contribution trunk sway , sensorimotor integration model use complement data interpretation .</detailed_description>
