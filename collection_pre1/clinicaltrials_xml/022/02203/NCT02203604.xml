	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well high-dose aldesleukin ipilimumab work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery . Biological therapy , aldesleukin , may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving high-dose aldesleukin together ipilimumab may work well treat patient melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Aldesleukin Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The best overall response rate within first 24 week combination interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) ipilimumab use immune-related response criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Best overall response ( BOR ) . II . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . Disease control rate ( DCR ) . IV . Overall survival . V. To collect data safety feasibility combine high-dose IL-2 ipilimumab . VI . To evaluate cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ CD8+ T cell response tumor microenvironment peripheral blood patient treat study . OUTLINE : INDUCTION : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 high-dose aldesleukin IV day 22-26 43-47 . MAINTENANCE : Beginning week 24 , patient without disease progression unacceptable toxicity receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 36 month .</detailed_description>
