	<brief_summary>Patients infection blood often become sick . These patient usually put intensive care unit careful observation treatment . These patient may develop low blood pressure , lung failure , kidney failure . When problem develop , care become quite complicate . Patients lung failure often need help breathe machine make certain breathing adequate . The machine help keep oxygen level high enough healthy tissue . When patient place machine breathing require tube place lung . This quite uncomfortable . These patient need sedation help tolerate uncomfortable breathe tube part routine necessary care . This study compare two drug ( dexmedetomidine propofol ) frequently use sedation intensive care patient . Clinical study suggest drug effective safe . The main question whether one drug well patient blood infection . This study try determine . Our main goal see whether patient one particular drug come breathing machine faster patient drug . These drug experimental drug approve Food Drug Administration . There placebo drug use study . All patient study receive best possible care base medical condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sedative Medications Patients With Severe Infection Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admit MICU acute respiratory care possible sepsis evaluate manage internal medicine MICU team . This team include faculty member , pulmonary fellow , internal medicine resident . These physician make decision regard initial management patient . The admit team approach study investigator solicit support recruitment patient study . During period time study investigator directly involve patient care . The general approach manage patient sepsis include blood culture , serum lactate level , empiric antibiotic . Other culture respiratory tract , urinary tract , sit also obtain indicate . Empiric antibiotic choice base likely source infection . Patient receive fluid administration vasopressor maintain mean arterial pressure blood pressure great equal 60 mmHg . Mechanical ventilation support follow ARDS network guideline . In general patient assist-control mode , low tidal volume ( 6 mm/kg ideal body weight ) , FiO2 adequate maintain O2 saturation great equal 90 % . PEEP level base FiO2 use ARDS network recommendation . The ventilator management goal low possible plateau pressure low FiO2 possible maintain adequate ventilation oxygenation . Fentanyl routinely order analgesia . Per current UMC policy , initial fentanyl bolus give 50mcg IV every 2 hour need keep pain level less 4/10 . At discretion provider , fentanyl drip may administer intermittent fentanyl achieve adequate analgesia . If fentanyl drip initiate , drip range 25-200 mcg/hour achieve pain level less 4/10 . If allergy fentanyl document , patient exclude study . Once mechanically ventilate patient sepsis select enrollment , patient randomize ( via computer-generated randomization program ) one two sedation arm : 1 ) propofol , 2 ) dexmedetomidine . Per current UMC policy , propofol initiate 5 mcg/kg/minute ( 0.3mg/kg/hour ) titrate every 5 minute 5mcg/kg/minute RASS ( Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ) goal -1 +1 . The maximum dose propofol 80 mcg/kg/minute . Dexmedetomidine initiate 0.2 mcg/kg/hour titrate every 5 minute 0.1mcg/kg/hour maximum dose 1.4 mcg/kg/hour RASS goal -1 +1 . Although dexmedetomidine approve United States short-term sedation ICU patient ( &lt; 24 hr ) maximal dose 0.7 μg/kg/hr ( 1.0 μg/kg/h procedural sedation ) , several study demonstrate safety efficacy dexmedetomidine infusion administer great 24 hr ( 28 day ) high dos ( 1.5 μg/kg/hr ) . Daily sedation stop perform study arm per MICU weaning policy . Patients allow return RASS 0 +1 , physician alert assessment . If physician determines sedation need re-started , 50 % dose prior sedation stop . This dose titrate RASS goal -1 +1 . Patients inadequate sedation score assign drug receive supplemental sedation midazolam lorazepam use IV bolus need base nursing physician assessment .</detailed_description>
