	<brief_summary>This two-part study grazoprevir ( MK-5172 ) + elbasvir ( MK-8742 ) Japanese participant chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 1 ( GT1 ) . Part I dose-finding study ; Part II , participant randomly assign receive grazoprevir dose determine Part I combination elbasvir . The primary study hypothesis percentage treatment-naïve participant Immediate Treatment Arm Part II achieve sustain viral response 12 week end treatment ( SVR12 ) great reference rate 75 % . A separate study arm cirrhotic participant also include Part II ; participant receive grazoprevir determine dose combination elbasvir .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Part 1 , HCV GT1 participant randomize one two arm : 50 mg grazoprevir plus 50 mg elbasvir 12 week double blind ( DB ) period follow 24 week follow-up ( FU ) open-label ( OL ) period [ Arm 1 ] ; 100 mg grazoprevir plus 50 mg elbasvir 12 week DB follow 24 week FU OL [ Arm 2 ] . Unblinding occur participant complete FU Week 4 time grazoprevir dose select . In Part 2 , non-cirrhotic HCV GT1 participant GT1 participant compensate liver cirrhosis receive select dose grazoprevir ( 50 mg 100 mg Part 1 ) 50 mg elbasvir 12 week . Non-cirrhotic GT1 participant randomize receive either ) 12 week active treatment immediately DB 24 week FU OL [ Arm 1/Immediate Arm ] b ) placebo 12 week 4 week follow-up DB follow 12 week active treatment 24 week follow-up OL [ Arm 2/Deferred Arm ] . All cirrhotic participant [ Arm 3/Cirrhotic ] receive select dose immediately 12 week DB 24 week FU OL . Safety analyse Part 1 Part 2 arm focus 12 week treatment phase plus first 4 FU week . For Part 2 Deferred Arm include initial 12 week placebo treatment first 4 week FU . Efficacy analyse Parts 1 2 evaluate active treatment ( Weeks 1-12 arm except Part 2 Deferred Arm week 16-28 ) . Part 1 : 50 mg grazoprevir + 50 mg elbasvir treatment 12 week , 24 week follow-up ( Arm 1 ) 100 mg grazoprevir + 50 mg elbasvir treatment 12 week , 24 week follow-up ( Arm 2 ) Part 2 : Selected dose grazoprevir + 50 mg elbasvir treatment 12 week , 24 week follow-up ( Arm 1/Immediate ) Placebo treatment 12 week , 4 week follow-up , select dose grazoprevir + 50 mg elbasvir treatment 12 week , 24 week follow-up ( Arm 2/Deferred ) Selected dose grazoprevir + 50 mg elbasvir treatment 12 week , 24 week follow-up ( Arm 3/Cirrhotic )</detailed_description>
