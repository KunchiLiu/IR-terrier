	<detailed_description>Gluten important protein component grain , notably wheat , rye , barley , basis variety wheat-derived alimentary product consume throughout world ( bread , pasta , pizza etc ) . However `` engineering '' gluten-containing grain create condition human disease relate gluten exposure . These form gluten intolerance represent heterogeneous set condition , include celiac disease , wheat allergy gluten sensitivity ( GS ) , , combine , seem affect 10 % general population . The immune responsiveness wheat antigens represent complex process , establishment maintenance completely elucidate . The frequent disease cause wheat ingestion T cell-mediated disorder , i.e . celiac disease IgE-mediated allergic reaction . However , besides celiac disease wheat allergy , case gluten reaction neither autoimmune IgE-mediated allergic mechanism involve . These generally define GS Not-celiac wheat sensitivity ( NCWS ) , know component cereal cause symptom . Some subject , experience symptom eat gluten-containing product show improvement follow gluten-free diet ( GFD ) may NCWS instead celiac disease wheat allergy . NCWS patient unable tolerate gluten develop adverse reaction eat gluten , , usually , differently celiac disease , lead small intestinal damage . Gastrointestinal symptom NCWS patient may resemble associated celiac disease , overall clinical picture generally less severe . Typically , NCWS diagnosis make exclusion , elimination diet `` open challenge '' ( i.e. , monitor reintroduction gluten-containing food ) often use evaluate whether health improves worsen elimination reintroduction gluten diet , respectively . The frequency NCWS however still unknown , even though study indicate high celiac disease ; consequently , probable condition undiagnosed under-diagnosed physician long time . However , difficult , circumstance , distinguish NCWS celiac disease . In fact , NCWS patient show intestinal histology characterize intra-epithelial lymphocytosis ( Marsh 1 ) , find consider compatible celiac disease diagnosis . In difficult , possible , celiac disease diagnosis , presence positive specific serum antibody ( anti-tTG EmAs ) paramount importance pose diagnosis . However , well know frequency positive serology dependent severity intestinal damage . Consequently , celiac disease patient less severe histology damage ( Marsh 1 ) negative serum antibody . Previous study demonstrate EmAs produce intestinal lymphocyte previous data group show EmAs assay culture medium intestinal biopsy higher diagnostic accuracy serum EmAs celiac disease diagnosis . Therefore , study one major aim : 1 . Evaluation clinical-serologic-histology course NCWS patient show positive EmAs assay culture medium duodenal biopsy time first evaluation ; one secondary aim : 2 . Evaluation adherence GFD NCWS patient previous full evaluation NCWS diagnosis base double-blinded placebo-controlled ( DBPC ) challenge . For research , investigator select adult patient , gender , affect NCWS ( i.e . symptoms/signs disappear gluten-free diet worsen gluten contain diet , test negative celiac disease , [ anti-tTG EmAs negative , biopsy Marsh 0-1 ] wheat allergy [ serum specific IgE wheat negative ] ) . The investigator include exclusively patient previously fully evaluate suspected celiac disease Hospitals ( Department Internal Medicine , Giovanni Paolo II Hospital Sciacca , Agrigento , Internal Medicine University Palermo ) January 2002 December 2012 . In patient NCWS diagnosis pose mean DBPC challenge wheat flour . At time first evaluation , gluten-free diet prescribed , simply suggest , patient consider suffer celiac disease . The investigator recruit , study group , NCWS patient show negative celiac disease serology Marsh 0-1 duodenal histology , display positive EmAs assay culture medium duodenal biopsy ( EmA-biopsy ) . As control group , NCWS patient negative EmA-biopsy include . The investigator include least one year evaluate patient . At time recruitment evaluate adherence gluten-free diet , mean previously validate dietary form contain printed list common food , symptom score ( Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale , GSRS ) . Then , investigator re-evaluate patient possible celiac disease diagnosis . Serum anti-tTG IgA IgG , anti-deamidated peptide gliadin ( DPG ) IgA IgG , anti-gliadin ( AGA ) IgA IgG assay . Duodenal biopsy take histological evaluation culture EmAs assay .</detailed_description>
