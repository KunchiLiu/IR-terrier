	<brief_summary>Background : - All cell go cycle allow divide . In normal cell , Chk1 Chk2 ( Chk1/2 ) stop cell division various point allow damage DNA repair . - When Chk1/2 present , cell stop divide eventually die . LY2606368 block Chk1/2 protein . - Researchers hope block Chk1/2 , cause tumor cell die , thereby shrink tumor . Objective : - To see LY2606368 help shrink tumor patient certain breast , ovarian prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Patients least 18 year old breast ovarian cancer . They must mutation BRCA1/2 gene group 1 , high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation group 2 , triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation group 3 , prostate cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation group 4 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) heart test , scan , X-rays . They piece tumor remove entry ( CT-assisted biopsy ) . - Study Day 1 : Participants physical exam blood drawn . They may CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . - Day 1 Day 15 28-day cycle : Participants receive study drug IV . - Vital sign check . An ECG do within 1 hour . - Day 15 Day 28 : Participants physical exam , blood drawn , 12 lead ECG . - Cycle 1 : Participants weekly phone call blood draw . Participants may another CT-assisted biopsy end cycle 1 . - Cycle 2 beyond , blood drawn every week routine blood test . - Participants after-study visit physical exam blood test . Participants may another biopsy progress treatment . They scan chest , pelvis , abdomen 12 lead ECG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Checkpoint kinases 1 2 ( Chk1/2 ) major regulator cell cycle intimately associate cellular response DNA damage repair . Chk1/2 also function primary mediator cell cycle arrest tumor p53 dysfunction , high-grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC ) , triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . - Patients germline BRCA1/2 mutation ( gBRCAm ) inherent defect DNA damage repair pathway . - Emerging data suggest half patient metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) p53 mutation subset mCRPC dysfunction gene involve DNA damage repair pathway . - Chk1/2 inhibition alone yield DNA damage mitotic catastrophe preclinically , even absence DNA damage external agent tumor underlie DNA repair dysfunction . - The second-generation Chk1/2 inhibitor , LY2606368 , yield safety preliminary single agent activity advance cancer patient . - We hypothesize LY2606368 result clinical benefit patient gBRCAmassociated breast ovarian cancer , HGSOC TNBC low genetic risk , subset mCRPC . Objectives : - To determine objective response rate ( CR+PR ) single agent LY2606368 patient gBRCAm-associated breast ovarian cancer , HGSOC TNBC low genetic risk , mCRPC . - To determine safety toxicity , progression-free interval ( PFI ) LY2606368 pretreated patient . - To determine biochemical change DNA damage repair cell cycle check point pathway tumor blood sample response treatment . - To determine potential resistance mechanism LY2606368 treatment HGSOC . Eligibility : - Patients recurrent/refractory gBRCAm-associated breast ovarian cancer , HGSOC , TNBC , mCRPC , remain standard curative measure . - A documented deleterious gBRCA1/2m breast ovarian cancer patient enrol Group 1 . - Negative gBRCAm test negative family history hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome HGSOC ( Group2 ) . - Negative gBRCAm test negative family history hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome TNBC ( Group 3 ) . - mCRPC soft tissue disease amenable biopsy ( Group 4 ) . Bone disease eligible . - Negative gBRCAm test negative family history hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC ( Group 5 ) . - Patients must prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy least 4 week . For patient mCPRC ( Group 4 ) , patient may hormonal therapy GnRH agonists/antagonists . - ECOG performance status 0-2 adequate organ marrow function . Design : - This open label , single arm phase II trial examine activity LY2606368 I patient 5 independent cohort ( Groups 1-5 ) . - LY2606368 dose RP2D 105 mg/m2 IV every 14 day 28daycycle . - Research sample include whole blood , CTCs , tumor biopsy obtain PD endpoint baseline , Cycle 1 Day 15 ( 6-24hr post-2nd dose ) , and/or progression patient . - Patients ( group 1-3 5 ) evaluate every two cycle response use RECIST v1.1 every cycle safety use CTCAE v4.0 . - Patients mCRPC ( group 4 ) evaluate every three cycle response use RECIST v1.1 criterion per prostate cancer clinical trial work group criterion 2 ( PCWG2 ) . Evaluation include CT image technetium 99 bone scan baseline every 3 cycle .</detailed_description>
