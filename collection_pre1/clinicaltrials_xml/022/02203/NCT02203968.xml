	<brief_summary>Trauma lead cause death people 44 year age young . After major trauma , follow high-speed motor vehicle collision , bleed couple clotting defect responsible death first hour hospital admission . Of note , bleeding-related death potentially preventable . Accordingly , initial in-hospital management severely injured patient focus stop bleeding , replace blood loss correct clot defect . Recently , animal human research demonstrate one major clot defect follow injury bleed drop blood level fibrinogen ( clot factor ) , detect hospital admission severely injured patient . These low fibrinogen level associate increase blood transfusion death . However , North America , standard care replace low fibrinogen require use cryoprecipitate , frozen blood product long preparation time , similarly blood product , carry risk viral transmission transfusion complication . Alternately , many Europeans country cryoprecipitate withdrawn market due safety concern , use fibrinogen concentrate . Fibrinogen concentrate undergoes pathogen inactivation , process eliminate risk transmit virus , bacteria parasite , likely safer faster alternative cryoprecipitate . In Canada , fibrinogen concentrate license congenital low fibrinogen . Although preliminary data suggest fibrinogen supplementation trauma associate reduce bleeding , blood transfusion , death , feasibility , safety efficacy early fibrinogen replacement remain unknown . We propose conduct feasibility randomize trial evaluate use early fibrinogen concentrate placebo injured patient trauma centre . A pilot trial necessary demonstrate feasibility rapidly prepare , deliver , infuse fibrinogen concentrate early therapy prevent excessive bleeding trauma . This feasibility trial provide preliminary safety clinical outcome data inform design large trial ; ultimately aim prevent bleeding-related death trauma population .</brief_summary>
