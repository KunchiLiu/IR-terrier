	<brief_summary>The project undertake Qilu Hospital Shandong University 5 well-known hospital China . In order report efficacy safety recombinant human thrombopoietin combine cyclosporin A treatment adult refractory immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , compare cyclosporin A monotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Investigation Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin ( rhTPO ) Combining Cyclosporin A Versus Cyclosporin A Management Steroid-Resistant/Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia （ITP）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicenter , randomize control trial 120 steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP adult patient 6 medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive recombinant human thrombopoietin ( give subcutaneously dose 300 Units/kg 14 consecutive day , follow flexible dosage depend platelet count 29th day ) , combine cyclosporin A ( give orally dose 1.5-2.0mg/kg twice daily 3 consecutive month , adjust maintain serum level 200-400 ng/ml taper 50 mg/d per week patient achieve complete response ) . The others select receive cyclosporin A monotherapy ( give orally dose 1.5-2.0mg/kg twice daily 3 consecutive month , adjust maintain serum level 200-400 ng/ml taper 50 mg/d per week patient achieve complete response ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study . In order report efficacy safety combination therapy compare cyclosporin A monotherapy treatment adult steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP .</detailed_description>
