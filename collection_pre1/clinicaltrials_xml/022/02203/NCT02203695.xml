	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis study outcomes patient biochemically recurrent prostate cancer follow radical prostatectomy improve addition enzalutamide 6-months compare standard-of-care salvage radiation therapy allow study definitive phase III setting . This study build prior success high-dose bicalutamide ( 24 month ) combine salvage external radiation therapy ( XRT ) , use new potent anti-androgen shorter duration time ( 6 month ) effort minimize adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Salvage Radiation Therapy Plus Enzalutamide Post Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enzalutamide second-generation androgen receptor signal inhibitor significantly prolongs survival patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receive prior docetaxel chemotherapy 35,36 . Enzalutamide demonstrate activity cell overexpress androgen receptor . Unlike previous androgen receptor blocker ( ARB ) agent , Enzalutamide display agonist property block translocation ligand-receptor complex nucleus prevent DNA bind 33 . Enzalutamide oral agent generally well tolerated require concurrent steroid administration , make ideal candidate combination salvage radiation therapy ( SRT ) . Finally , provocative preliminary Phase II data present American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) 2013 M. Smith colleague assess efficacy safety 25-weeks ( ~6-mos ) enzalutamide alone prostate cancer stag never receive hormone therapy ; present non-castrate testosterone level ( 230 ng/dL ) . Enzalutamide alone 6-mos achieve high PSA response rate efficacy similar castration , .in contrast castration , bone mineral density ( BMD ) remain stable metabolic variable substantially impact . The trial describe differs Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 96-01 , RTOG 05-34 RADICALS several way . First , eligibility criterion stricter ; less favorable patient select . Second , short-term ARB test , RTOG 96-01 RADICALS long-term ARB 2-years examine . Finally , importantly , test second generation ARB agent , enzalutamide , alone combination SRT oppose RTOG 05-34 RADICALS use androgen deprivation ( AD ) . This trial intend address efficacy SRT alone observation . The complete response rate ( drop PSA undetectable level ) SRT 70 % -80 % durable response observe 30 % -40 % patient . For reason , feasible appropriate randomize men observation SRT . The important issue whether proportion durable response increase alter therapeutic approach , use enhance ARB use enzalutamide .</detailed_description>
