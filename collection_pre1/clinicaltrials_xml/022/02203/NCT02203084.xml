There limited prospective data effect social deprivation child BC none concern effect social deprivation child chronic disease . In order generate relevant data manage child chronic disease BC , investigator wish perform observational study relationship questionnaire-derived social variable measure outcomes child cystic fibrosis , type 1 diabetes , chronic kidney disease .

	<detailed_description>1 . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Cystic fibrosis genetic condition cause slowly progressive lung disease . It occur people social class disease independent social factor . There considerable variation outcome CF different child . There many potential cause difference available literature would suggest significant part variability due social factor . While prospective clinical study , limited information database review suggest socially deprive child significantly bad outcome . In US , child live poverty twice likely underweight three time likely die ( 25 ) . UK data similar - disadvantage child bad growth parameter low lung function compare rich child ( 26 ) . 2 . Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . Type 1 diabetes multi-factorial disease . It autosomal recessive disease like CF genetic predisposition one predisposing feature . As data CF , socio-economic deprivation show significant adverse effect outcome type 1 diabetes . In US , glycemic control amongst young adult significantly bad amongst disadvantage young adult ( 27 ) . A retrospective review New Zealand child type 1 diabetes also show poor socio-economic status Polynesian ethnicity significantly associate poor glycemic control long term complication ( 28 ) . 3 . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Chronic kidney disease may due congenital , acquire , hereditary cause . Within group , socioeconomic status , gender , race may influence disease progression outcomes . It show child chronic kidney disease , primarily United States , common low- middle- income family abnormal birth history prematurity , low birth weight small age predisposes development renal disease ( 29 ) . In addition , blood pressure control height deficit improve faster child family higher income . In Canada , Aboriginals high prevalence severe chronic kidney disease 77 % increased mortality risk ( 30,31 ) low likelihood nephrology clinic visit ( 32 ) . Aboriginal child young adult chronic kidney disease likely glomerulonephritis cause kidney disease compare Caucasians likely reach end stage renal disease ( 33 ) . In contrast , low mortality risk see East Asian Indo Asian Canadian adult start dialysis ( 34 ) . There still much study influence various factor renal health disease . STUDY DESIGN . 1 . Study Objective . We wish determine influence education , income , race access health care upon health outcome child chronic disease British Columbia . 2 . Justification . While effect social deprivation health outcome commonly discuss , surprising little prospective research quantify adverse effect social inequity . There limited prospective data effect social deprivation child BC none concern effect social deprivation child chronic disease . In order generate firm data relevant manage child chronic disease BC , wish perform cross sectional observational study relationship social variable outcome child cystic fibrosis , type 1 diabetes chronic kidney disease . 3 . General design . All family three clinic initially inform study letter . When child due regular follow-up assessment , parent approach clinic visit invite join study . Their participation involve completion questionnaire . The research assistant collect data interview subsequently ( parental permission ) retrieve laboratory result record previous clinic visit assess measure health trend time . The study protocol add investigation questionnaire . Apart variable time need parent information consent , questionnaire require 30 minute complete . 4 . Questionnaire . We use socio-economic assessment question already use study quality life parent care child need home ventilation . It conventional form assess education level , employment , income , partnership status ethnicity . This last important poor health outcome already know associate Aboriginal background . The proxy access health care distance main specialty clinic number visit last year . 5 . Analysis . The relationship socio-economic variable plus ethnicity outcome examine use multiple linear regression analysis . In absence relevant literature , many unknown allow reliable form power analysis patient number calculation perform . One accept 'rule thumb ' least 10 patient predictive variable multiple linear regression analysis . We concentrate 6 8 main social factor try enroll 100 patient within sub-specialty - enough ensure 15 20 patient outcome variable .</detailed_description>
