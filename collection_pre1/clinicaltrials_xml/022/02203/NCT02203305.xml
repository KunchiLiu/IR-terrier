	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Cases Single-Sided Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-sided deafness ( SSD ) define moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss limit speech perception benefit one ear normal hear contralateral ear . Though one ear within normal hear limit , SSD may result reduce speech perception noise , variable ability localization task , increase subjective report hear handicap , reduce quality life . This patient population utilize conventional amplification due severity hearing loss poor speech discrimination ability affect ear . Current treatment option include : contralateral rout signal ( CROS ) hearing aid , bone-conduction device . A CROS hearing aid two-part system include microphone/transmitter affect ear receiver normal hearing ear . The microphone/transmitter send acoustic signal affect ear receiver , present normal hearing ear . Bone-conduction device utilize percutaneous , implanted titanium abutment send acoustic signal affect side normal hearing ear via vibration . The goal technology send signal affected side normal hearing side , thereby leave patient unilateral listen condition . Though CROS hear aid bone-conduction device provide patient auditory information side well hear ear , ability use binaural cue speech perception noise variable . It interest whether cochlear implantation affect ear would benefit SSD population . A cochlear implant two-part system , include internal electrode array external speech processor . The internal electrode array surgically implant affected cochlea . The external speech processor receive sound transmits signal internal portion . The electrode array present acoustic signal via electrical pulse within cochlea , interpret brain sound . Presumably , cochlear implantation may provide SSD population improvement speech perception affect ear , benefit appropriately fit hearing aid . Cochlear implantation may provide benefit current treatment option SSD population , stimulate auditory pathway affected side , thus allow ipsilateral representation acoustic signal arrive ear independently . The primary goal project determine whether subject SSD experience improvement speech perception , localization , quality life cochlear implant compare unaided listening condition . Secondary aim include : 1 ) comparison speech perception , localization , quality life outcome study population SSD control group long-term listen experience current treatment option ( i.e . bone-conduction device ) , 2 ) within-subject comparison speech perception localization ability cochlear implantation versus bone-conduction test device .</detailed_description>
