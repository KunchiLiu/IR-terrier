	<criteria>1 . Male female patient 40 80 year age , screen visit ( SV ) , sign informed consent prior initiation study related procedure . 2 . Diagnosis COPD define Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline . 3 . A measured postbronchodilator ( albuterol 360 mcg ) force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) ≥30 % &lt; 80 % predict normal SV . Predicted normal determine use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III standard value Caucasians , African Americans MexicanAmericans adjustment predict value make Asian American patient . 4 . A measured postbronchodilator ( albuterol 360 mcg ) FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 0.70 SV . 5 . A minimum body weight 40 kg . ( Note : For patient participate pharmacokinetic [ PK ] sub study minimum body weight 50 kg require . ) 6 . If female , currently pregnant , breast feeding , attempt become pregnant ( 4 week SV throughout duration study ) , nonchildbearing potential , define : ≥1 year postmenopausal ( 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea permit , provide local record serum follicle stimulate hormone &gt; 40 mIU/mL source document ) Surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , salpingectomy , hysterectomy ) Or childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test , willing commit use consistent acceptable method birth control , define , duration study : Systemic contraception use ≥1 month prior screen , include birth control pill , transdermal patch , vaginal ring , implant , injectables Double barrier method ( spermicide following : condom , cervical cap , diaphragm , vaginal contraceptive film ) Intrauterine device ( IUD ) low failure rate define &lt; 1 % per year ( use copper IUDs acceptable ) Or childbearing potential sexually active , negative serum pregnancy test , , event patient become sexually active , willing commit use consistent acceptable method birth control , define , duration study . At discretion investigator , total abstinence acceptable case age , career ( eg , priest ) , lifestyle , and/or sexual orientation patient ensure compliance . 7 . Current exsmoker ≥10 packyear smoke history ( number cigarette pack smoke per day multiply number year smoke ; eg , 2 packs/day 3 year equal 6 packyear history ) . 8 . Patient free medical condition concomitant treatment could interfere study conduct , influence interpretation study observations/results , put patient increase risk study . 9 . Able perform technically acceptable reproducible spirometry per American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) 2005 guideline study guideline , define protocol study reference manual ; include able tolerate withdrawal applicable medication require spirometry assessment . 10 . Able perform acceptable peak expiratory flow measurement . 11 . Able maintain record ( patient daily diary ) study period require protocol . 12 . Able demonstrate proper inhalation technique require correct use delivery device ( BAI dry powder inhaler [ DPI ] ) require study . 13 . Capable understanding requirement , risk , benefit study participation , , judge investigator , capable give informed consent compliant study requirement . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 1 . Pregnancy , nursing , plan become pregnant donate gamete ( ova sperm ) vitro fertilization study period 30 day follow patient 's last study relate visit ( eligible patient , applicable ) . 2 . Current evidence clinically significant uncontrolled disease include , limited : cardiovascular ( eg , uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure , know aortic aneurysm , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia coronary heart disease ) , hepatic , renal , hematological , neuropsychological , endocrine ( eg , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , Addison 's disease , Cushing 's syndrome ) , gastrointestinal ( eg , poorly control peptic ulcer , gastroesophageal reflux disease ) , pulmonary ( COPD asthma , sarcoidosis , non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia diagnosis alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency ) . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety patient risk participation , could affect endpoint analysis disease/condition worsen study . 3 . History and/or current diagnosis asthma . 4 . History lifethreatening COPD exacerbation define protocol COPD episode require intubation associate respiratory arrest . 5 . Thoracotomy pulmonary resection . 6 . Current congestive heart failure , history current evidence myocardial infarction ( within 1 year SV ) , current history active ischemic heart disease ( exertional intermittent angina ) . 7 . History current evidence clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia abnormality , include diagnosis screening ECG . Findings always consider clinically significant exclude patient study participation include , limited , follow : ventricular rate &lt; 45 beat per minute ( bpm ) &gt; 100 bpm PR interval &gt; 240 msec evidence 2nd 3rddegree atrioventricular block ( exclude MobitzI ) evidence supraventricular ventricular ectopy arrhythmia correct QT interval ( QTc ) ( Bazett 's Fridericia 's method ) &gt; 500 msec nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay &gt; 120 msec STT wave abnormality ( exclude nonspecific STT wave abnormality ) indicative acute ischemia/infarction right leave complete bundle branch block artificial pacemaker 8 . The patient medical condition may potentially aggravate anticholinergic drug tiotropium , eg : The patient history presence glaucoma ( particularly angleclosure glaucoma ) The patient symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia . The patient known history current evidence renal impairment urinary retention ( eg , bladder outlet obstruction ) . This include abnormal renal function test result screen . 9 . History malignancy ( exclude treat nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within past 5 year , regardless clinical significance current stability disease . 10 . History silent ( active ) infection , include positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 , HIV2 , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , tuberculosis . 11 . Occurrence upper low respiratory infection , include limited common cold flu , sinusitis , tonsillitis , pneumonia , bronchitis , ear infection ( include otitis medium externa ) resolve 4 week prior SV/informed consent . 12 . Occurrence COPD exacerbation resolve 4 week prior SV/informed consent . • Note : An exacerbation COPD define worsen patient 's baseline COPD symptoms require treatment beyond study medication , rescue albuterol patient 's regular maintenance treatment . This include require use systemic corticosteroid , antibiotic and/or emergency room visit hospitalization . 13 . Patients require regular use daytime oxygen therapy . 14 . Patients start stop exercise rehabilitation program within 4 week SV . 15 . Known suspected hypersensitivity idiosyncratic reaction tiotropium , ingredient use study medication formulation . 16 . Severe allergy milk protein . 17 . Significant adverse drug reaction , include allergy hypersensitivity reaction , atropine anticholinergic substance relate pharmacologically atropine ( eg , ipratropium oxitropium ) . 18 . Use prohibit concomitant medication within require ( per protocol ) washout period prior SV . 19 . Treatment orally administer ( exclude orally inhale ) βadrenergic agonist ( ie , oral albuterol ) . 20 . Recent initiation treatment dose titration βadrenergic receptor antagonist ( eg , nonselective βreceptor block agent βblocking antihypertensive product ) administer route . Permitted exception : ( 1 ) Patients treat stable dose nonselective βreceptor block agent 3 month prior SV longer may consider enrollment expect maintain dose throughout study ( 2 ) Patients stable dose cardioselective β1 adrenergic receptor antagonist ( eg , atenolol , metaprolol , bisoprolol ) least 1 week prior SV permit expect maintain dose throughout study . 21 . Treatment drug commonly recognize prolong QTc interval ( eg , quinolones , amiodarone , disopyramide , quinidine , sotalol , chlorpromazine , haloperidol , ketoconazole , terfenadine , cisapride , terodiline ) . 22 .

For patient use inhaled corticosteroid , initiation change dose inhaled corticosteroid within last 30 day prior SV , and/or patient expect maintain stable dose inhaled corticosteroid course study . 24 . For patient use maintenance oral corticosteroid COPD , average daily dose great than10 mg prednisone equivalent per day dose stable 6 week prior SV . The patient 's prior oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) dose maintain without change study . ( Note oral steroid burst complete 6 week prior screen acceptable . ) 25 . Exposure investigational drug within 30 day 6 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior SV . 26 . Has history alcohol and/or substance abuse within past 5 year . aa .
