	<detailed_description>Patients evidence relapse persistent hematopoietic malignancy ( e.g . acute leukemia , MDS , Hodgkins lymphoma , CML ) eligible study . Patients enrol two time point ( differ indication ) two group ( Group A - post HSCT Group B- pre HSCT ) . Because patient persistent malignancy prior transplantation extremely poor prognosis , patient eligible receive TAA-CTL and/or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Group B patient may receive autologous TAA-CTL follow cycle conventional chemotherapy effort decrease burden disease prior HSCT . Additionally , patient persistent disease high risk relapse eligible receive plan infusion TAA-CTL HSCT ( give high likelihood relapse poor outcome ) group A . These high risk/refractory patient donor enrol prior HSCT TAA-CTL give time day 30 post HSCT In either population , utilize rapid generation protocol multi-antigen specific T lymphocytes . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell expose antigen present cell pulse peptide tumor antigen ( Prame , WT1 , Survivin , MAGE-A3 ) cytokine milieu favorable T cell expansion/activation , induce selective expansion T cell target kill tumor cell . Patients would monitor development toxicity . In patient disease time TAA-CTL infusion , efficacy would evaluate secondary endpoint use standard criterion . Exploratory investigational analysis would include monitor cytokine cellular milieu pre- post- TAA-CTL infusion vitro characterization host tumor , donor lymphocyte product , TAA-CTL product . For Group A Patients ( post HSCT ) : T cell infused time neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT day 30 , whichever come first . For Group B Patients ( pre HSCT ) : T cell infused time &gt; 1 week previous therapy relapse disease . Four different dose schedule evaluate . Two four patient evaluate dose schedule ( see ) . This protocol design phase I dose-escalation study . Each patient receive 1 injection per dose level , least 14 day apart , accord follow dosing schedule . The expected volume infusion 1 10 cc . Dose Level One : 5 x 106 cells/m2 Dose Level Two : 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three : 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Four : 4 x 107 cells/m2 Patients receive cell either : prior refractory disease and/or high risk relapse and/or detectable disease time infusion . Group A Group B patient use dose escalation strategy describe . Ideally , patient receive systemic antineoplastic agent least 6 week infusion TAA- specific T-cells ( purpose evaluation ) , although treatment may add discretion attend physician . If patient active disease stable disease partial response International Working Group ( IWG ) criteria 8 week subsequent evaluation eligible receive 6 additional dos CTLs monthly intervals-each consist cell number second injection . Patients able receive additional dos initial safety profile complete 6 week follow second infusion .</detailed_description>
