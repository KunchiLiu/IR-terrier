	<brief_summary>Subjects select among investigator ' patient population already schedule receive marrow stimulate procedure ( MSP ) , without addition BioCartilage . During surgical operation MSP , portion patient 's blood take used form patch cover cartilage defect knee . Currently consider standard care either form patch use portion patient 's blood , form patch use portion patient 's blood combine FDA-approved augmentation BioCartilage . This study collect outcome data MRI patient undergo MSP without BioCartilage augmentation , compare data receive BioCartilage . The primary endpoint determine whether subject receive marrow stimulating procedure ( MSP ) augment BioCartilage improve outcome ( measure use quality life indicator , functional outcome , MRI ) compare subject receive MSP without use BioCartilage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison BioCartilage Versus Marrow Stimulating Procedure Cartilage Defects Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent development treatment articular cartilage defect result several technique involve stimulation native cellular component purpose differentiation proliferation cartilage defect . Techniques interest study use microfracture combine platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) , recently develop augmentation microfracture procedure-BioCartilage . The microfracture procedure perform PowerPick . During procedure , patient focal cartilage defect undergoes arthroscopic debridement defect microfracture use create hole subchondral plate order provide access mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) . To complete marrow stimulating procedure ( MSP ) , microfractured region fill PRP harvest intraoperatively patient . A fibrin glue use cover defect hold PRP repair place . This basic MSP show regenerate cartilage tissue improve joint function . Microfracture treatment use PRP `` show good excellent short-term outcome appropriately indicate patient '' ( Abrams , Mall , Fortier , Roller , &amp; Cole , 2013 ) , however successful long-term outcome demonstrated literature . BioCartilage , novel therapy develop Arthrex Inc , implement augmentation basic approach use microfracture PRP . All aspect procedure , well indication procedure , basic MSP described , except PRP combine BioCartilage powder , act scaffold cellular growth . BioCartilage FDA approve augmentation microfracture treatment PRP , powder contains live cell . Animal model use BioCartilage provide data support assertion BioCartilage augmentation may improve outcome patient receive ; however currently publish human clinical outcome data available use BioCartilage ( Abrams et al. , 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
