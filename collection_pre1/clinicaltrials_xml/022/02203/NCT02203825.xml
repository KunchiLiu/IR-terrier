	<brief_summary>This Phase I clinical trial evaluate chimeric-antigen receptor ( CAR ) T-cells ( CM-CS1 T cell ) recognize NKG2D-ligands surface cancer cell . This study evaluate safety feasibility administer single intravenous dose CM-CS1 CAR T-cells patient AML , MDS-RAEB Multiple Myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Chimeric Antigen Receptor Modified T-cells Targeting NKG2D-Ligands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study patient AML MDS-RAEB remission reasonable standard treatment option patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma progressive disease . In study , participant 's white blood cell ( T-cells ) collect modified T-cells able recognize specific molecule ( call NKG2D-ligands ) , express surface cancer cell diseases . This modification genetic change T-cells . The modified T cell , call CM-CS1 T-cells , give back participant single intravenous infusion . In study , participant receive chemotherapy prior infusion CM-CS1 T-cells . The study evaluate whether safe feasible administer CM-CS1 T-cells participant AML/MDS-RAEB multiple myeloma . It also evaluate whether CM-CS1 T-cells beneficial effect cancer cell . Another goal study learn persistence function CM-CS1 T-cells body . Participants follow closely first month infusion . They require remain within 50 mile Brigham Women 's Hospital ( Boston , MA ) 10 day infusion follow three time per week first 21 day day 28 . Subsequently , participant follow monthly 6 month infusion , every 3 month 15 month infusion 24 month infusion . Because study involve gene transfer , participant follow yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
