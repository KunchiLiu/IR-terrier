	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate three hard reline material 3 6 month use mandibular complete denture . The effect hard relining material support tissue patient ' satisfaction also assess . Materials Methods : 36 complete edentulous patient already maxillary denture complain instable mandibular denture invite participate study . Mandibular denture reline randomly one three reline material : two chairside reline material ( Tokuyama Rebase II Fast , Tokuyama Dental Co , Japan ) , ( Flexacryl Hard , Lang Co , USA ) one heat cure acrylic resin ( Vertex , Dental technology Co , Holland ) . The color stability reline material , peeling , effect support tissue assess two separate prosthodontist 3 6 month follow . In addition , patient ask grade overall satisfaction Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) range 0 100 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Relining denture process resurface tissue side denture make fit accurately Direct reline removable denture hard chair-side reline material suitable improving fit denture base support tissue . Chairside reline material convenient processed laboratory direct method faster cause clinically significant dimensional change reline resin . However , autopolymerized reline resin use direct method , several problem occur burn sensation cause monomer , exothermic heat reaction unpleasant odor . There three type hard reline chair-side material : Dual-polymerized Visible light-polymerized Triad DuaLine , Light Liner ( Hard ) , Astron LC ( Hard ) .Visible light-polymerized Lightdon-U , Triad Hi-Flow Reline Material , Triad VLC Reline Material . Finally , autopolymerized New Truline , Tokuyama Rebase II ( Fast ) , GC Reline . Other concern relate direct reline material include patient tolerance ( taste , temperature , odor ) , color stability , durability ease handle polishing . Few study evaluate effect disinfection solution reline material property roughness hardness . In one study , disinfectant solution cause decrease hardness , whereas roughness , material test show statistically significant increase , except Tokuyama . Depending examine reline material , material increase others decrease surface roughness immersion disinfect solution microwave disinfection . All previous laboratory study concentrate effect disinfection reline material property roughness , hardness , color change . However , clinical study compare chemically cure heat cure reline material effect support tissue . The aim study evaluate clinical performance two -chemically cured- heat cure denture reline material 3 6 month use . In addition , effect hard relining material support tissue , patient ' satisfaction evaluate yet .</detailed_description>
