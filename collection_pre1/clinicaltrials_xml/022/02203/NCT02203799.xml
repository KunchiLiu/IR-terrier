Thereafter , dose escalation would continue outline protocol approximately 50 week maintenance dose peanut protein ( 3900 mg ) reach . The maintenance phase continue end build-up phase approximately 24 month . During phase , subject switch peanut equivalent dose maintenance phase . At conclusion maintenance phase DBPCFC do . Negative challenge confirm open challenge . DBPCFC do .</detailed_description>
