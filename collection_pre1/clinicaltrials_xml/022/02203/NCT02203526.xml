	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : - Primary CNS lymphoma ( PCNSL ) rare subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . - The outcome patient diagnosis significantly bad systemic DLBCL . Most treatment approach past included high dose methotrexate radiation treatment . - Most PCNSLs appear activate B-cell ( ABC ) origin . - Ibrutinib inhibitor Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) effective systemic DLBCL ABC origin . - We propose study ibrutinib combine novel chemotherapy platform call dose adjust temozolomide , etoposide , doxil , dexamethasone , ibrutinib , rituximab ( DA-TEDDI-R ) . OBJECTIVE : - Identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ibrutinib dose achieves adequate CSF concentration , whichever come first , ibrutinib give DA-TEDDI-R . ELIGIBILITY : - Newly diagnose relapsed/refractory PCNSL . - Age great equal 18 year . - No pregnant breast-feeding woman . - Adequate organ function ( define protocol ) . STUDY DESIGN : - This phase 1 study 40 patient . - The study two component . 1 . Phase 1 : MTD ibrutinib identify dose ibrutinib achieves concentration less equal 100 nM CSF , give combination DA-TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy , whichever come first . 2 . Expansion cohort : Safety tolerability regimen relapsed/refractory previously untreated PCNSL ( DLBCL type ) assess final ibrutinib dose DA-TEDDI-R 10 patient .

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm primary central nervous system diffuse large Bcell lymphoma . Both newly diagnose patient patient relapsed refractory disease eligible . At least 2 week pass since prior chemotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy , major surgery , investigational anticancer therapy consider diseasedirected . Ibrutinib must discontinue 7 day ( possible ) 7 day major surgery , 3 day ( possible ) 3 day minor surgery . Thus , patient enrol ibrutinib trial must complete major surgery &gt; 7 day initiate treatment , and/or must complete minor surgery &gt; 3 day initiate treatment . Recovered prior toxicity Grade 01 least 2 week prior investigational therapy . Men woman age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) unless due CNS Lymphoma . Patients must normal organ marrow function define , independent growth factor transfusion support . Patients receive growth factor transfusion least 7 day prior first dose study drug exception pegylated GCSF ( pegfilgrastim ) darbopoeitin require least 14 day prior screen randomization.. absolute neutrophil count great equal to750 cells/mcL ( 0.75 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ) platelet count great equal 50,000 cells/mcL ( 50 X 10 ( 9 ) /L ) hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dL total bilirubin less equal to1.5 time ULN ( unless Gilbert syndrome disease infiltration liver present ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3.0 time institutional ULN Serum Creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min/1.73m2 unless lymphoma relate . Prothrombin time/INR ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal range ( ULN ) ; except , opinion Investigator , aPTT elevate positive Lupus Anticoagulant . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 40 % assessed echocardiogram MUGA The effect ibrutinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason tyrosine kinase inhibitor well therapeutic agent use trial may teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry . Female patient nonreproductive potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal history menses ( Bullet ) 1 year ; OR history hysterectomy ; OR history bilateral tubal ligation ; OR history bilateral oophorectomy ) .

Unable swallow capsule , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function resection stomach small bowel , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis , partial complete bowel obstruction . Serologic status reflect active hepatitis B C infection . Patients positive hepatitis B core antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis C antibody must negative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) prior enrollment . ( PCR positive patient exclude . ) History stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 6 month prior enrollment . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition , organ system dysfunction , Investigator opinion , could compromise patient safety , put study undue risk . Concomitant use warfarin vitamin K antagonists within last 28 day . Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy corticosteroid ( e.g. , cyclosporine A , tacrolimus , etc . ) within 28 day first dose study drug . Vaccinated live , attenuated vaccine within 4 week first dose study drug . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy , define resolved Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE , version 4 ) , grade less equal to1 , level dictate inclusion/exclusion criterion exception alopecia . Known bleed disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand disease ) hemophilia . Major surgery within 4 week first dose study drug . Unwilling unable participate require study evaluation procedure . Currently active , clinically significant hepatic impairment ( ( Bullet ) moderate hepatic impairment accord NCI/Child Pugh classification .</criteria>
