	<brief_summary>Study Promotion Health Recycling Lead ( SPHERL ) prospective 2-year follow-up study lead worker exposure level vary within individual . SPHERL address extent between-subject difference within-subject change lead exposure may measurable impact blood pressure , cardiovascular system , renal function , autonomic nervous system , peripheral nervous conduction velocity , neurocognitive function .

	<brief_title>Study Promotion Health Recycling Lead</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Whether low-level lead exposure impact blood pressure , regulation cardiovascular system , glomerular tubular renal function , sympathetic nervous modulation , peripheral nervous conduction velocity , neurocognitive function remain uncertain . Study Population - SPHERL enroll 500 lead recycle worker change lead exposure , examine baseline ( 2014-2015 ) follow annual interval 2 year ( 2016-2017 ) . Methods - Volunteers eligible study ( ) new exist hire without previous occupational lead exposure perform task without occupational lead exposure ( ii ) exist hire occupational lead exposure transition job task without occupational lead exposure within next 2 year . - Blood lead concentration main biomarker exposure . - The main outcome variable ( ) blood pressure measure conventionally ambulatory monitoring , analyze continuous categorical variable , cross-sectionally longitudinally ; ( ii ) index glomerular tubular renal function , ( iii ) heart rate variability analyze frequency domain measure autonomous sympathetic modulation , ( iv ) peripheral nerve conductivity , ( v ) neurocognitive performance , ( vi ) quality life [ EuroQOL five dimension ( EQ-5D ) questionnaire ] . Expected Outcomes - Assuming 4-fold high surge blood lead concentration , study power demonstrate 2 year acceleration age-related rise systolic blood pressure 1 4 mm Hg increase coefficient multiple determination ( R2 ) 0.22 0.24 add change blood lead concentration model relate change blood pressure three covariables . The longitudinal design study complies temporality principle Bradford-Hill criterion assess possible causality outcomes exposure .</detailed_description>
