	<brief_summary>This study use artificial intelligence platform automatically confirm medication ingestion . The Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) -compliant platform download 'app ' onto smartphone automate directly observe therapy ( Automated DOT® ) . Real-time patient adherence data encrypt automatically send centralize web-based dashboard use healthcare professional research staff . Unlike Facetime® Skype® , system relies computer vision algorithm confirm process medication administration ; human review necessary . The purpose study evaluate feasibility acceptability , measure accuracy , AiCure platform ( `` platform '' ) patient treat opioid dependence Zubsolv® course 12 week . The follow aim test : 1 ) ass feasibility acceptability participant study staff use AiCure monitor medication adherence ; 2 ) evaluate acceptability use AiCure optimize care pathway ; 3 ) measure reliability validity AiCure detect interruption treatment . To assess feasibility acceptability platform , measure rate physician satisfaction user acceptance . Optimization care pathway measure assess sustainability AiCure use 12 week ( retention rate ) measure illicit opioid use ( urine drug screen ) compare historical data . Reliability validity AiCure measure compare AiCure adherence pharmacokinetic data . All participant request take prescribed dose use app . Participants able download app onto smartphone provision device start study . The data capture medication ingestion process automatically encrypt store participant smartphone upload wirelessly cloud-based dashboard . If participant non-adherent ( miss dose , incorrect dosage ) suspicious behavior detect , automate alert sent study staff via email SMS prompt immediate intervention . In addition , participant receive treatment usual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Artificial Intelligence To Monitor Medication Adherence Opioid Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study employ multi-site , single-arm design . A total approximately 50-100 participant - patient stable least 2 week current opioid replacement medication - recruit study . All participant receive doctor 's treatment-as-usual . Patients currently prescribe Zubsolv® switch Zubsolv® . Study visit include screen visit , one baseline visit ( ideally occur 7 14 day screen visit ) , bi-weekly visit 12 week ( six visit ) follow baseline visit . During baseline visit , participant train use AiCure app . Training consist number interactive training step teach participant use app correctly . Participants provide three placebo tablet train . Study participant reimburse cover time transportation cost accordance Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) guideline . Participants receive contingency management ( CM ) reinforce regular use app . Orexo AB provide study drug , Zubsolv® , participant throughout 12-week treatment duration . For length study , participant request take dose prescribe Zubsolv® regimen use AiCure app . Each medication administration event save onto participant 's smartphone encrypt data ( include de-identified video time date administration ) automatically transmit centralized dashboard . Research staff access dashboard view real-time detail dose history participant . Access dashboard roles-based password-protected . If participant dose use AiCure app ( misses/skips dose ) , self-reports device phone , tag suspicious behavior , participant receive combination automate SMS text message tailor SMS text message / phone call research staff base pre-defined escalation protocol .</detailed_description>
