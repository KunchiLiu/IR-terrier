	<brief_title>Molecular Profiling Tissue Samples From Patients With Cancer Who Are Exceptional Responders Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify molecular indicator malignant tissue patient exceptional responder clinical trial standard systemic treatment use whole exome and/or target deep sequencing , well potentially sequence molecular characterization method ( adequate tissue exists ) . II . To explore association identify molecular indicator putative mechanism action treatment receive patient . III . To test feasibility identify `` exceptional responder '' , obtain relevant tumor normal tissue clinical data , perform whole exome and/or target deep sequencing sample . OUTLINE : Previously collect tissue sample analyze via whole exome sequence and/or target next generation sequencing ( NGS ) assay deep sequencing . Cases sufficient nucleic acid amount available undergo additional analysis include whole genome sequencing , messenger ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( mRNA ) -sequencing , micro ( miRNA ) sequencing , promoter methylation analysis , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis .</detailed_description>
