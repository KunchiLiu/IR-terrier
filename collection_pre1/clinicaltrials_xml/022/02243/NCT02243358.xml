	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety effectiveness novel neoadjuvant treatment strategy incorporate 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) chemotherapy combination chemo-radiation gemcitabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Chemo-Radiotherapy Patients With Resectable Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate frequency achieve complete resection ( RO resection ) patient resectable borderline resectable pancreatic cancer treat neoadjuvant regimen FOLFOX follow radiation therapy ( RT ) concurrent gemcitabine chemotherapy standard dose . Secondary objective determine overall survival progression-free survival function time study enrollment evaluate tolerability toxicity protocol treatment . Eligible patient resectable borderline resectable pancreatic cancer accrue onto protocol therapy , would include neo-adjuvant phase follow surgical resection . A cycle FOLFOX treatment 14 day . 2 cycle intend prior combine modality treatment . Combined modality treatment begin 2 week ( plus minus 2 day ) last FOLFOX administration . ( Gemcitabine 1000mg/mÂ² infuse 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 5-week course radiation treatment . The surgical procedure perform required complete resection , base discretion operate surgeon . Patients follow 1 year completion neoadjuvant therapy removal termination study , death , whichever occur first . Patients see follow-up ever 3+/- 1 month 1 year completion protocol therapy .</detailed_description>
