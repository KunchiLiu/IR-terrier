	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Stage IB-IVB Mycosis Fungoides Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) subject relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome ( MF/SS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore clinical activity MK-3475 subject relapsed/refractory MF SS respect follow endpoint : duration response ( DOR ) ; progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week 2 year ( 6 month patient achieve complete response [ CR ] ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
