	<brief_summary>During wean work breathing transfer ventilator back patient . Approximately 40 % time ventilator spend wean . Studies support use screening protocol test patient 's ability breathe spontaneously ( SBTs ) identify wean candidate . The investigator work demonstrate daily screen current standard care . The conduct daily ward round daily screen ICUs poorly align rapidly change clinical status critically ill patient . With respiratory therapist ( RTs ) Canadian intensive care unit ( ICUs ) , significant opportunity exist screen patient often , conduct SBTs , reduce time spend ventilator ICU . Only one mechanical ventilation trial focus elderly trial evaluate wean outcomes elderly elderly may influence presence comorbidities , frailty , malnutrition treatment limitation . The investigator propose conduct pilot randomize trial 100 elderly ( &gt; /= 65 year ) critically ill adult compare 'once daily ' screen 'at least twice daily ' screen 8 adult ICUs . In proposed trial , investigator ( ) evaluate ability recruit elderly ( &gt; /= 65 year ) critically ill patient wean trial ( ii ) ass whether protocol adhere similarly elderly ( 65 80 year ) elderly ( &gt; 80 year ) trial participant . Moreover , also address generalizability issue conduct mechanical ventilation research evaluate potential bias associate exclusion criterion consent elderly elderly patient obtain preliminary estimate difference important clinical outcome elderly elderly participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In context multicentre , pilot trial 100 elderly ( &gt; /= 65 year ) critically ill adult compare two strategy identify wean candidate ( 'once daily ' vs. 'at least twice daily ' screening ) 8 ICUs across Canada , propose assess feasibility metric reflect ability consent , enroll recruit elderly elderly invasively ventilated patient evaluate adherence study protocols preparation launch large scale screen RCT . 1 . Primary Research Question ( ) Can recruit invasively ventilate elderly ( age &gt; /= 65 year ) critically ill adult wean trial compare alternative screening strategy ? 2 . Secondary Research Questions ( ii ) Can clinicians adhere assign screening protocol study arm ? 3 . Tertiary Research Questions ( ii ) What proportion enrol elderly elderly trial participant ? ( iii ) Are proportion consent obtain decline trial participation similar eligible elderly elderly trial participant ? ( iv ) What rate reason trial exclusion base eligible elderly elderly patient ? ( v ) What effect , preliminary estimate , alternative screening strategy clinically important outcome [ e.g. , time first Spontaneous Breathing Trial ( SBT ) first successful SBT , time first extubation successful extubation , total duration mechanical ventilation , intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospital length stay , ICU hospital mortality , use noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) follow extubation , complication ( self-extubation , tracheostomy , reintubation , proportion require prolonged mechanical ventilation ) adverse event ] elderly elderly trial participant . 4 . Quaternary Research Questions ( ) Can assess quantify current practice related sedation , analgesia delirium management mobilization conduct 'once daily ' 'at least twice daily screen ' assessment wean readiness goal quantify factor may lead performance bias future , plan , large scale wean trial . ( ii ) Can identify barrier ( clinician institutional ) recruitment study ? ( iii ) Can classify trial participant require ( ) simple , ( ii ) difficult ( iii ) prolong wean use 'Task Force Weaning ' definition . Hypotheses We hypothesize achieve feasibility metric , specifically , : 1 . We recruit least 2 elderly critically ill patient , average , per month per ICU . 2 . Compliance rate least 80 % study arm contamination daily screen arm &lt; 10 % . 3 . We expect enroll similar proportion elderly elderly trial participant . 4 . We anticipate proportion consent obtain similar eligible elderly elderly participant , rate decline consent higher elderly trial participant . 5 . We anticipate rate exclusion great elderly trial participant due increase prevalence comorbid illnesses treatment limitation . 6 . We expect preliminary estimate impact alternative screening strategy clinically important outcome similar elderly elderly trial participant . 7 . Practices sedation , analgesia , delirium mobilization record least 80 % time . 8 . We identify potentially modifiable clinician institutional barrier recruitment . 9 . Proportions critically ill adult require simple , difficult prolong wean Canadian ICUs similar report world literature .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The investigator include : 1. elderly ( age &gt; /= 65 year ) critically ill adult 2. receive invasive mechanical ventilation least 24 hour breathe spontaneously Pressure Support ( PS ) trigger breaths volume pressure Assist Control ( AC ) , volume pressure Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation ( SIMV ) Â± PS , Pressure Regulated Volume Control ( PRVC ) Airway Pressure Release Ventilation ( APRV ) . 3. patient must receive &lt; /= 70 % inspired oxygen 4. positive endexpiratory pressure &lt; /= 12 cm H2O ( Table 2 ) . . The investigator exclude patient already undergone extubation SBT , unlikely benefit ( e.g . moribund , expect brain death ) , automate wean mode , participate study wean protocol , optimize regard sedation mobilization . Specifically , exclude patient : 1. admit cardiopulmonary arrest brain death expect brain death , 2. evidence myocardial ischemia 24 hour period enrollment , 3. receive continuous invasive mechanical ventilation &gt; /= 2 week , 4. tracheostomy situ time screening , 5. receive sedative infusion seizure alcohol withdrawal , 6. require escalating dos sedative agent , 7. receive neuromuscular blocker know quadriplegia , paraplegia 4 limb weakness paralysis prevent active mobilization ( e.g. , active range motion , exercise bed , sit edge bed , transfer bed chair , stand , march place , ambulate ) , 8. moribund ( e.g. , imminent risk death ) limitation treatment ( e.g. , withdrawal support , reintubate order , however , resuscitate order permit ) , 9. profound neurologic deficit ( e.g . large intracranial stroke bleed ) Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) &lt; /= 6 , 10. use mode automate SBT conduct , 11. current enrol confounding study include wean protocol , 12. previously enrol trial , 13. patient already undergone SBT 14. patient already undergone extubation [ plan , unplanned ( e.g . self , accidental ) ] ICU admission .</criteria>
