	<brief_summary>The aim multicenter trial determine efficacy preoperative intravenous iron suppletion comparison standard preoperative oral substitution anaemic patient colorectal cancer cure anemia assess effect preoperative iron morbidity , postoperative recovery quality life . Hypothesis : It hypothesis profound approach preoperative anaemia intravenous iron lead high percentage patient normalization Hb-level ( &gt; 12 g/dl ( 7.5 mmol/l ) woman &gt; 13 g/dl ( 8 mmol/l ) men ) , potentially reduce morbidity , length stay , improve quality live , decrease fatigue could cost effective compare current practice oral substitution iron .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Ferric ( III ) Carboxymaltose Infusion With Oral Iron Suppletion Treatment Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter randomize clinical trial aim optimize postoperative outcome anaemic patient undergo curative surgery colorectal carcinoma . The aim trial investigate route administration superior treatment iron deficiency anaemia patient . In addition , economic evaluation intravenous iron versus oral iron do . The evaluation perform societal perspective ( ) cost-effectiveness analysis cost per responder iron suppletion therapy primary outcome ( ii ) cost-utility analysis cost per quality adjust life-year ( QALY ) primary outcome . The cost effectiveness analysis closely relate clinical efficacy measure allow set priority treatment anaemia colorectal cancer patient . The cost-utility analysis allow comparison societal impact intravenous iron suppletion post-operative recovery , short length stay earlier return daily activity , impact intervention intervention area health care . The primary aim trial : 1 . To compare percentage patient normalization Hb-level ( &gt; 12 g/dl ( 7.5 mmol/l ) woman &gt; 13 g/dl ( 8 mmol/l ) men intravenous versus oral iron therapy patient undergo curative surgery colorectal carcinoma . Secondary aim FIT trial : 2 . To analyse effect preoperative iron therapy ( intravenous versus oral ) postoperative morbidity , length stay , amount blood transfusion need quality life fatigue score . 3 . To determine cost effectiveness preoperative intravenous iron substitution comparison oral substitution . Sample size : The principal analysis consist intention-to-treat comparison proportion patient iron deficiency anaemia two study group . The trial design superiority trial , hypothesize great percentage patient achieve normalization Hb-level ( call 'responder ' ) favour infusion ferric ( III ) carboxymaltose compare oral iron suppletion . Our power calculation base study Seid et al ( 19 ) , compare ferric ( III ) carboxymaltose oral ferrous sulphate population post-partum woman iron deficiency anaemia . The proportion achieve normalization Hb two week treatment 55 % intravenous iron group 35 % oral iron group . We expect efficacy iron therapy low patient colorectal carcinoma . Therefore , expect percentage patient achieve normalization Hb-level ( Hb &gt; 7.5 mmol/l ( 12 g/dl ) woman Hb &gt; 8.o mmol/l ( 13 g/dl ) men ) 45 % intravenous iron group 25 % oral iron group . Based proportion , sample size 89 patient per group need Chi square test achieve 80 % power two side alpha 0.05 . With estimate loss follow 10 % , sample size 198 calculate . We use nQuery advisor version 7.0 calculate sample size .</detailed_description>
