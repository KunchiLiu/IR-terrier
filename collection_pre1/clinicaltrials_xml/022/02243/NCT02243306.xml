	<brief_summary>GSK1278863 orally-active , novel small molecule agent inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) prolyl -4- hydroxylases ( PHDs ) development treatment anaemia associate chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . As kidney represent major site elimination many drug metabolite , GSK1278863 administer subject various stage renal disease , important characterize pharmacokinetics target patient population . The purpose study characterize pharmacokinetics GSK1278863 metabolites subject end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) undergo peritoneal dialysis . This repeat-dose , open-label , parallel-group study . Approximately 30 subject ESRD enrol two cohort ( 15 subject cohort ) ensure 6 subject continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) ( cohort 1 ) 6 subject automate peritoneal dialysis APD ( cohort 2 ) complete dose critical assessment . GSK1278863 administer daily 14 day . Primary pharmacokinetic assessment make Days 1 14 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>SAFETY : Satisfactory medical evaluation base upon medical history , medication history , physical examination , clinical laboratory data obtain Screening visit . The determination clinical significance make Investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor require find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure , integrity study . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &lt; 470 millisecond ( msec ) OR QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . These base average triplicate value obtain brief recording period Screening Day 1 single reading Day 17 . The QT correction formula use determine inclusion discontinuation individual subject throughout study . Vitamin B12 folate low limit normal Screening . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin &lt; =1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . EFFICACY : A subject eligible enroll participate study he/she ESRD peritoneal dialysis least 2 month average urine output &lt; 750 mL/daily combine weekly ( urine peritoneal dialysis output ) Kt/V urea &gt; 1.7 measured time within last 3 month . No history peritoneal dialysisassociated peritonitis , peritoneal catheter tunnel ( exit site ) infection leakage least 3 month study . Meets follow erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) criterion : Is ESA naive ( i.e. , ESA use within previous 12 week screen ) OR agree discontinue ESA ( currently use ESA ) least 7 day prior first dose GSK1278863 completion Followup visit ( If subject schedule ESA interval &lt; =7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least 7 day prior first dose GSK1278863 . If subject schedule ESA interval &gt; 7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least scheduled interval length [ e.g. , ESA interval 14 day , ESA must discontinue &gt; =14 day ] prior first dose GSK1278863 ) Has haemoglobin value : For ESA na√Øve subject : &lt; 10.0 g/dL ( UK site ( ) : &lt; =11.0 g/dL ) ; For subject receive ongoing ESA treatment : &lt; =11.0 g/dL Screening ( UK site ( ) : &lt; =12.0 g/dL Screening ) . OTHER : Subjects &gt; =18 year age time Screening . A female subject eligible participate : ( ) Childbearing potential , agree use one contraception method describe protocol . This criterion must follow time Screening completion Followup Visit ; ( b ) Nonchildbearing potential , define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( In questionable case , blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) 23.0116.3 international unit ( IU ) /litre ( L ) estradiol &lt; =10 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; =37 picomoles [ pmol ] /L ) confirmatory ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method describe protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 month must elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Body weight &gt; 45 kilogram ( kg ) &lt; 140 kg Screening . The subject mentally legally able comply requirement restriction protocol provide sign informed consent prior participation protocolspecific procedure , include Screening procedure . SAFETY A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . Uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure [ BP ] &gt; 100 millimetre mercury [ mmHg ] systolic BP &gt; 170 mmHg ) Screening . History drug abuse dependence within 6 month study . History sensitivity GSK1278863 , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( clinical research unit use heparin maintain intravenous cannula patency ) .
