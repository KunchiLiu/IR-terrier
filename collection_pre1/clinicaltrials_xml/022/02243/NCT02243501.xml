	<brief_summary>Up 25 % child suffer sleep problem categorize `` insomnia '' : difficulty settling , fall asleep , stay asleep . This lead daytime sleepiness negatively effect behaviour , mood , academic performance . It also negative effect primary caregiver 's sleep daytime functioning . Despite robust evidence support efficacy behavioural treatment insomnia child , receive treatment . The common treatment insomnia child medication . This pattern care trouble approve medication insomnia child , concern safety side effect medication . One primary reason low rate evidence-based treatment shortage available treatment resource parent health care provider . When evidence-based treatment available , usually provide traditional service delivery framework . These traditional approach often difficult parent access due scheduling conflict , incidental cost , travel difficulty . Thus , critical need access effective intervention focus insomnia child , increase knowledge parent health care provider appropriate treatment insomnia . The Better Nights , Better Days ( BNBD ) program provide potential solution one common treatment barrier : access care . BNBD provide readily accessible distance treatment via internet , increase access evidence-based care insomnia typically develop child age 1 10 . BNBD develop base evidence-based program extant literature . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) participant ( primary caregiver child age 1 10 year insomnia ) assign Intervention Usual Care base 1-to-1 allocation . The effect behavioural sleep intervention assess 4 8 month post baseline assessment . Assessment include sleep daytime function child , daytime function caregiver . This study align recognize need rapidly transfer new scientific knowledge improve patient care population health , target validation new treatment delivery model increase availability effective treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Evidence demonstrate behavioural intervention first line treatment child insomnia , typically case . Evidence-based behavioural intervention protocol readily available clinical use , lack implementation indicate inadequate knowledge translation . When evidence-based treatment available , usually provide traditional service delivery framework ( i.e. , face-to-face therapy , small group therapy ) . These traditional approach often difficult parent access due scheduling conflict , incidental cost , travel difficulty . Thus , critical need access effective intervention focus insomnia child , increase knowledge parent health care provider appropriate treatment insomnia . The Better Nights , Better Days ( BNBD ) program bridge gap provide potential solution one common treatment barrier , access care . Intervention : The BNBD intervention child age 1 10 year insomnia bilingual , self-guided program deliver online . The intervention incorporate evidence-based strategy , include sleep education , positive routine , fade bedtime response cost , sleep restriction , extinction/graduated extinction , stimulus fading , schedule awakening . The intervention comprise five session make available sequentially participant . The completion time intervention range 5-10 week . Each session provide factual information parent , strategy implementation best practice address sleep problem , access additional help advice . There also `` Reward Centre '' parent learn use reinforcement child ( e.g. , sticker chart ) help support implementation sleep intervention strategy . Participants complete short Sleep Diary minimum 5 day session throughout intervention receive feedback progress . The intervention delivers interactive , personalized cognitive behavioural change strategy access participant ' desktop , laptop , tablet smartphones . The program use time convenient participant , remove barrier care provide service comfort privacy home . Objectives Hypotheses : The study evaluate effectiveness BNBD online intervention insomnia child 1-10 year age . The primary objective ass immediate impact ( Baseline vs. 4 month ) intervention child 's sleep . The two hypothesis primary outcome : 1 . Improvements sleep efficiency calculate use actigraphy data Intervention Group compare Usual Care Group , 2 . Improvements sleep efficiency calculate use Sleep Diary data Intervention Group compare Usual Care Group The secondary objective : ) evaluate longer-term impact ( baseline , 4 , 8 month ) child 's sleep psychosocial health , b ) examine impact parent daytime fatigue psychosocial health outcome . The four hypothesis secondary outcome : 1 . Children Intervention Group show improvement compare child Usual Care Group two follow-up time point symptom insomnia base improvement sleep efficiency calculate use actigraphy Sleep Diary data Intervention group compare Usual Care group . 2 . Children Intervention Group show improvement compare child Usual Care Group two follow-up time point symptom insomnia base total score Behavioural Insomnia Questionnaire ( BIQ ) Tayside Children 's Sleep Questionnaire ( TCSQ ; toddler pre-schoolers ) / Sleep Disturbance Scale Children ( SDSC ; school-age ) . 3 . Children Intervention group , compare child Usual Care Group , show improve psychosocial health base internalize externalize total score Child Behaviour Checklist ( CBCL/1 Â½-5 CBCL/6-18 ) total score Pediatric Quality Life ( Peds- QL ) . 4 . Parents randomized Intervention Group , compare parent randomize Usual Care group , show follow-up time point : 1.Decreased daytime fatigue base Single Item Fatigue Impact Scale ( SIFIS ) 2.Improved psychosocial health assess total score Depression , Anxiety Stress Scales ( DASS-21 ) 3.Improved parent strategy assess total score Parenting Scale ( PS ) Exploratory analyse examine age effect , impact intervention child 's physical health , well process-level evaluation implementation question , explore BNBD work ( e.g. , change specific sleep behaviour bedtime routine , predictor treatment success ) . Study Design : The study two-arm Randomized Controlled Tiral ( RCT ) design , use 1-to-1 allocation , compare participant assign receive either BNBD online program parent ( Intervention Group ) control group ( Usual Care Group ) receive intervention . The intervention deliver across Canada . The study coordinate Corkum LABS Dalhousie University . Randomization use minimize bias assignment participant either group , increase likelihood know unknown participant attribute ( e.g. , demographic baseline characteristic ) evenly balance , enhance validity statistical comparison across group . Participants stratify randomization three age group ( Toddler , Pre-School , School-Aged ) two primary language ( English French ) . Targets set variable - 1/3 sample age group 20 % sample French speaking , model Canadian populatipm . This ensure study population representative balance . Within stratum , subject randomize use equal allocation ratio 1:1 . Both Intervention Group Usual Care Group able access alternative resource additional program service enrol study . Blocks 6 use randomize participant stratum . The block size short enough prevent imbalance , long enough prevent guess allocation trial . The power analyse indicate need 250 participant total complete final follow-up assessment 8 month post randomization . Based Investigators past intervention research well sleep intervention trial literature , 500 participant successfully complete eligibility need use estimate 50 % drop rate post-eligibility final follow-up assessment 8 month . More specifically , loss participant stage estimate follow : 22 % post eligibility end baseline , 15 % post-randomization 4 month assessment , 13 % 4 month 8 month assessment . Outcome measure administer participant Baseline 4 8 month post-randomization online REDCap database . Data collect 8 month assess degree maintenance initial treatment effect child 's sleep age group , well examine longer-term impact intervention child parent psychosocial health . The REDCap database automatically contact participant via email complete assessment . There automate email REDCap follow phone call research staff ensure outcome data collect . Study participation end participant study group complete 8 month follow-up assessment . Participants Usual Care group gain access BNBD program study participation complete . The BNBD program accessible Usual Care group 3 month . Subject Population : A total 500 participant eligible participate study . Participants recruit across Canadian province territory . A target 100 English-speaking participant recruit across four geographical region Canada ( Atlantic , Central , Prairies , West Coast Northern Territories ) . Data Analysis : The primary outcome measure use evaluate impact intervention program insomnia symptom sleep efficiency base actigraphy data sleep efficiency base Sleep Diary data . Two primary outcome measure include order capture variables interest use objective measure sleep ( i.e. , actigraphy ) parent-report/subjective measure sleep ( i.e. , Sleep Diary ) , thus allow comparison exist research field . Another reason use objective subjective measure find unblinded RCTs ( i.e. , participant know group assignment current study ) demonstrate biased favour active treatment , suggest objective measure ( e.g. , actigraphy ) utilize assessment outcome . Secondary outcome examine longer-term impact change sleep well impact child 's psychosocial health ( behavioural , attentional , emotional functioning ) duration 8 month trial . We also examine impact parent ' fatigue level psychosocial health . Primary Outcome : A mixed effect General Linear Models fit data test Intervention group demonstrate improve outcome compare Usual Care group . The dependent variable primary outcome assess 4 8 month post-randomization ( sleep efficiency actigraphy Sleep Diary ) . Participants model random effect group ( Intervention vs. Usual Care ) baseline covariates ( age language ) model fixed effect . A significant interaction effect time ( baseline , 4 8 month ) group indicate intervention effect treatment . Secondary Outcome : All secondary outcome separately analyze use Hierarchical Linear Modelling test difference two group ( Intervention vs. Usual Care ) growth curve model change outcome variable across four point measurement , control age , language covariates . Exploratory analysis : The investigator examine possibility differential response treatment across three age group use growth curve model two primary outcome ( actigraphy Sleep Diary ) .</detailed_description>
