	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor activity cabozantinib-s-malate ( cabozantinib ) Ewing sarcoma , term 6-month objective response per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , Revised ( RECIST version [ v ] 1.1 ) . II . To evaluate antitumor activity cabozantinib osteosarcoma , term 6-month objective response ( complete response , partial response ) 6-month non-progression ( complete response , partial response stable disease ) , per RECIST v1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . 6-month objective response . ( Ewing sarcoma ) II . Best overall response ( per revise RECIST v1.1 ) . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) III . 1- 2-year progression-free survival . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) IV . 1- 2-year overall survival . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) V. Cabozantinib safety . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) VI . To assess ability metabolic tumor response measure fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) end one cycle treatment predict progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) VII . Translational research : determine compare tumor expression MET , phosphorylated ( phosphor ) -MET circulate level HGF , soluble MET ( sMET ) , VEGF-A , soluble VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) ( sVEGFR2 ) prior follow administration cabozantinib . ( Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma ) OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
