	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain frequent feature peripheral neuropathy cause significant impact patient ' quality life health care cost . Not individual neuropathy develop pain possible predict less susceptible among similar risk exposure . Current inability identify high-risk individual hinders development application therapy counteract neuropathic pain address target prevention strategy . Recently , investigator Consortium identify novel pathogenic mutation gene encode two sodium channel ( Nav1.7 Nav1.8 ) know play critical role generation conduction action potential nociceptors terminal axon . This study undertake carefully select group patient painful neuropathy use candidate gene approach directly reveal target new therapeutic strategy . This discover widen spectrum sodium channel-related pain disorder include condition common general population know far . PROPANE STUDY , start hypothesis common origin neuropathic pain cohort patient predominantly small fibre neuropathy , aim develop original idea large well characterize study population , provide evidence reliable stratification patient high risk potential new treatment tailor patient ' clinical feature , order improve quality life .</brief_summary>
