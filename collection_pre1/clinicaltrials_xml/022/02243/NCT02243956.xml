	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) include cluster dysfunction identifies subject risk develop type-2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . A key feature appear chronic increase inflammation activation innate system . Consequently , increase low-grade inflammation connect adverse effect insulin sensitivity , glucose- lipid metabolism , blood pressure , circulate marker inflammation IL-6 . A grow body evidence also link low-grade inflammation poorer cognitive functioning . Type 2 diabetes , MetS , glucose intolerance increasingly associate impaired cognition . Dietary pattern promote sub-clinical inflammation increasingly consider predictive future risk CVD type-2 diabetes . Epidemiological data show high consumption vegetable fruit associate lowered risk cancer cardiovascular disease , may due high concentration polyphenols anti-oxidants find food . In presently describe project hypothesize four week daily consumption product specific high flavanols improve metabolic risk variable cognitive function healthy subject . The purpose therefore investigate effect flavanols cognitive function cardiometabolic risk , investigate relation cardiometabolic risk marker cognitive performance . The test product commonly use food product , know specifically rich flavanols . The effect test product compare effect control product base similar food product lacking flavanols . Test parameter : Cognitive test : Working memory test ( oral test ) , selection attention test ( measure also reaction time , computerized test ) , stroop test ( computerized test . Mood determine 6 different mood sensation use VAS scale . Bio marker blood : glucose regulation ( glucose , insulin ) , marker inflammation oxidative stress ( IL-6 , MDA , oxLDL ) , blood lipid ( total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) , vascular function ( P-Selectin , PAI-1 , NO ) , gut hormone involve metabolism satiety ( PYY , GLP-1 ) gut hormon involve mucosa integrity ( GLP-2 ) , marker brain function ( BDNF , neurotensin ) . Blood pressure .</detailed_description>
