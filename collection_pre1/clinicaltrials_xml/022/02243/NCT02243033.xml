	<brief_summary>Target recruitment : 1000 subject . The purpose research study continue investigate safety effectiveness use MR ( magnetic resonance ) guide laser focal therapy prostate cancer evaluate oncologic control 20 year . We hypothesize laser focal therapy use achieve oncologic control carefully select patient . MR use large magnet produce picture areas/organs inside body . The laser use light heat target area try destroy cancerous cell . The laser system use call Visualase® Thermal Therapy System . This system use treatment brain , bone ( spine ) , thyroid , liver cancer . However ; study first time system study use treatment prostate cancer trans-rectal approach . MR-guided biopsy laser applicator placement perform use Invivo DynaTRIM trans-rectal biopsy guidance system . This system clear ( approve ) U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laser-induced interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) novel form control , target thermal ablation may offer measurable advantage ablative therapy focal prostate therapy . Because LITT magnetic resonance ( MR ) compatible , enable image advantage surgical ablation technique utilize transrectal ultrasound target monitor treatment . MR image provide excellent soft-tissue contrast three-dimensional ( 3D ) anatomical image arbitrary plane , help improve treatment plan target . Additionally , MR-based temperature monitoring allow real-time feedback MRI-guided thermal therapy deposition light energy MR signal acquisition perform simultaneously without degradation MR signal . Also , MR diagnostic environment allows use post- treatment image verify tissue damage . Because MR image clearly depict prostate anatomy surround critical structure , MR image incorporated plan external- beam radiotherapy , brachytherapy , treatment prostate . In addition basic feature , Multiparametric prostate MRI ( mpMRI ) may use identify region disease prostate well target therapy . In study , investigator propose evaluate efficacy novel , FDA-approved thermal therapy feedback system ( Visualase® Thermal Therapy System ) treatment biopsy confirm MR-imageable prostate lesion . This system use human treatment brain , bone ( spine ) , thyroid , liver cancer . Early feasibility study prostate cancer use transperineal approach ; however evaluate primary treatment prostate cancer use transrectal approach . This system allow delivery laser energy patient simultaneously image MRI unit . The system 's real-time MR thermal imaging ( MRTI ) provide information thermal dose deliver target , result precise control delivery previously possible ablative therapy . The investigator hypothesize system integrated practical feasible outpatient treatment paradigm focal treatment localized prostate cancer allow patient avoid complication associated radical whole-gland therapy .</detailed_description>
