	<brief_summary>Most patient suffer Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) successfully treat standard chemo- and/or radiotherapy . However , patient refractory disease/relapsing first line therapy , conventional-dose chemotherapy regimen induce low remission rate , long-term disease free survival high 10 % patient . High-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) become standard treatment patient . This treatment approach result long-term remission approximately 40-50 % relapsed patient , 25-30 % primary refractory disease . The possibility cure depend several prognostic factor , however , almost series , strong prognostic factor disease status ASCT . Patients HL achieve complete remission ( CR ) induction chemotherapy unresponsive relapse poor prognosis . Therefore , choice active pre-transplant salvage chemotherapy regimen extremely important improve result ASCT . In addition , activity also combine good stem cell mobilize potential low toxicity profile . Several pre-transplant salvage regimen refractory/relapsed HL currently use overall response ( OR ) CR rate range 60 % 88 % 17 % 49 % , respectively . No randomized trial exists compare effectiveness regimen . ESHAP ( Etoposide , Solumoderin ( methylprednisolone ) , Ara-C ( Cytarabine ) cisplatin ) one commonly use regimen . ESHAP induce OR CR 73 % 41 % , respectively , 5 % toxic death . In present study , combination ESHAP plus Brentuximab Vedotin ( BV ) propose pre-transplant therapy aim improve CR rate ASCT . HL characterize presence CD30-positive Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cell . The antibody-drug conjugate BV deliver highly potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) CD30-positive malignant cell bind specifically CD30 cell surface release MMAE inside cell via lysosomal degradation . Binding MMAE tubulin result apoptotic death CD30 express tumor cell . The goal : Determine Maximum Tolerable Dose BV combination ESHAP relapsed/resistant HL patient Evaluate global complete response rate BV-ESHAP salvage regimen prior ASCT</brief_summary>
