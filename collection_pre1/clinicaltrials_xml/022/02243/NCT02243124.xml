	<detailed_description>The study nonrandomized open-label treatment vary dos cenersen intravenous administration : Primary *To ass safety profile dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) cenersen three increase dose level stipulate protocol patient low risk MDS define low intermediate-1 risk IPSS . Secondary - To determine low pharmacologically active exposure among three increase dose level stipulate protocol exhibit desire activity erythropoiesis evaluation dose level , - To determine intermittent treatment cenersen reduce transfusion requirement patient low risk MDS .</detailed_description>
