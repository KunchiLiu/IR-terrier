	<brief_summary>This study investigate use radiation treat wet age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . The radiation deliver use robotically control device project overlap beam radiation onto macula , part eye affect wet AMD . Participants randomize receive radiation ( stereotactic radiotherapy ) simulate placebo treatment ( sham control ) . They follow regularly two year , end three four year safety visit . Participants also receive injection ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) eye wet AMD active . Ranibizumab standard anti-VEGF agent use treat wet AMD . The study aim determine stereotactic radiosurgery maintain vision reduce need regular anti-VEGF injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiotherapy Wet AMD ( STAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead people go blind eye disease combine . 'Wet ' AMD occur abnormal new blood vessel grow macula . The macula area inside back eye , tightly pack light-sensitive cell give fine central vision driving , reading , facial recognition etc . Most patient treat repeated injection ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , aflibercept ( Eylea ) eye ( drug suppress new vessel growth ) . Unsurprisingly , need hospital visit every 1-2 month , regular injection eye , favoured patient . The propose study investigate use radiation treat wet AMD . Radiation preferentially damage proliferate cell , form abnormal new blood vessel . It potential kill abnormal cell , unlike injection suppress disease . The radiation deliver use robotically control device aim three beam radiation white eye , overlap macula . Initial study stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) promising , establish best dose radiation . They show radiation potential significantly reduce need injection . Each injection cost National Health Service ( NHS ) approximately Â£600 , hence potential cost saving substantial . For respond well , disease activity reduce , injection eliminate greatly reduce . Eye charity run focus group people wet AMD help set priority , participant identify burden treat wet AMD one pressing concern , greatly restrict freedom quality life . Repeated injection also carry risk rare blind complication , long term may possibly lead eye disease glaucoma atrophy macula . The preliminary SRT study design determine visual outcome , good , bad standard injection therapy , follow short determine long term risk . A large study therefore require confirm SRT reduce number injection determine visual outcomes acceptable . There also need long term safety monitoring , radiation damage typically delayed onset . STAR use ranibizumab anti-VEGF agent treatment control arm . Ranibizumab choose bevacizumab license use eye , present bevacizumab use small minority NHS hospital , result bevacizumab may less generalisable . Bevacizumab may slow recruitment prospective participant anxious swap label treatment , preliminary discussion prospective site indicate investigator would prefer use ranibizumab . Further , ranibizumab use phase II INTREPID study ( detail ) , help inform STAR statistical analysis . Aflibercept 's mandate dosing year 1 mean possible determine radiation reduces need anti-VEGF treatment , primary outcome measure . Participants randomly allocate dummy SRT ( 0 Gray dose ) live SRT ( 16 Gray ) . Neither treat doctor participant know 0 16 Gray dose give . SRT perform approximately 3 national treatment centre , 25 NHS recruiting hospital refer patient SRT , review afterwards , treat ranibizumab need . Participants attend examination monthly two year . They revert standard NHS care , two study visit - one end year 3 one end year 4 . These two late safety visit exclude delay radiation damage . At 24 monthly visit participant vision test eye chart , laser scan ( OCT ) macula . If vision drop OCT show disease activity , receive injection ranibizumab . Participants image blood vessel macula ( angiography ) baseline yearly thereafter 4 year . The image interpret independent , specialist reading centre quantify effect treatment , study interaction radiation wet AMD , look subtle radiation damage , subclassify disease determine respond best SRT . We predict SRT produce similar , possibly good vision ranibizumab alone , few injection . With 411 participant 90 % certainty result valid . Participants provide feedback use establish questionnaire acceptable find SRT , visual function , overall quality life . Experienced health economist look cost treatment relation improvement quality life , see SRT cost-effective . The main outcome monitor number eye injection visual function eye chart , several observation make . In particular , monitor safety treatment , collateral damage cause radiation , interaction radiation diseased eye tissue . If proven effective , SRT potential save NHS money , importantly , may reduce burden care face 250,000 people wet AMD .</detailed_description>
