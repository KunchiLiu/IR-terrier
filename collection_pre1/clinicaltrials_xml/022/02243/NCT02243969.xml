	<brief_summary>Rationale : Increased intake n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , mainly find fatty fish , recommend prevention coronary heart disease . Alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA , C18:3n-3 ) common vegetable-oil base n-3 fatty acid . Evidence exist ALA supplementation also protective effect development cardiovascular disease , may exert cardio protective effect different route . The benefit may ( partly ) due blood pressure lower . However , evidence beneficial effect ALA blood pressure conflict . Therefore , propose investigate effect flaxseed oil , high ALA , use study power 24-hour blood pressure , population high normal blood pressure mild hypertension . Objective : To study effect flaxseed oil , rich ALA 24h-ambulatory mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) men woman high-normal blood pressure mild hypertension compare high oleic sunflower oil , poor ALA. Study design : Using double blind randomize , placebo-controlled parallel design , subject receive random daily 10 g flaxseed oil high-oleic acid sunflower oil ( HOSF ) control twelve week , run-in period 14 day advance . Study population : 72 men woman , age 40-70 year , untreated high-normal blood pressure stage I hypertension body mass index 25 35 kg/m2 participate run-in intervention period . It estimate 144 subject screen find 72 subject enter run-in period . Intervention : During run-in period , subject receive daily 10 g palm super olein oil . During intervention period subject receive either 10 g HOSF flaxseed oil . All oil provide bottle 5 g , one consume breakfast lunch one dinner . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter change 24h-ambulatory mean arterial pressure ( MAP )</brief_summary>
