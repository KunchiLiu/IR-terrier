	<brief_title>Preoperative Warming Perioperative Shivering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadvertent peri-operative hypothermia ( IPH ) shiver one commonly recognize problem anesthesia believe thermoregulatory origin . Although shiver uncomfortable patient , unlikely relatively small increase total body oxygen consumption average shivering patient associate increase peri-operative morbidity . It common patient complain bad memory recovery room intense cold sensation uncontrollable shivering . New guideline recommend patient core temperature maintain &gt; 36Â°C , postoperatively . Studies suggest pre-warming patient prior surgery reduce chance hypothermia induce shiver post operative period . Forced air warmer frequently use active warm device peri-operative set . They effective prevent hypothermia induce shiver use induction anesthesia , anesthesia surgery , emergence post-anesthesia care unit . Other method warm fluid , opioids , blanket warm light device use less effective compare force air warm device . Currently , hospital pre-warm patient study show pre-warming reduces post-operative shivering , able make evidence base decision start practice .</detailed_description>
