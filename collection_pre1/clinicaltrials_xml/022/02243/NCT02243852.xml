	<brief_summary>This study recruit healthy control ( normal GH production growth hormone level ) patient identify GHD , deem eligible GH replacement therapy accord NICE guideline . The patient recruit identified start GH refer clinician decision make replacement therapy prior potential enrollment study . The study , research team , influence decision whether patient start GH , many GH formulation patient receives . The propose study observational study determine GH affect plasma level Fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21 ) response treatment ; whether change FGF21 mirror improvement body composition/fat deposition . FGF21 metabolic regulator act multiple tissue coordinate carbohydrate lipid metabolism regulate energy balance . We hypothesize FGF-21 express secrete liver skeletal muscle human response growth hormone administration level may reduce patient GHD compare healthy control . Furthermore , believe beneficial effect long-term GH replacement body composition ( reduction visceral adipose tissue , subcutaneous adipose tissue liver fat ) , improvement lipid profile skeletal muscle mitochondrial function involve GH-induced release FGF21 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growth hormone ( GH ) involve control people 's general health underproduction growth hormone ( growth hormone deficiency GHD ) lead people feel generally unwell low feel well-being quality life score . In addition , investigator , others , demonstrate people GHD reduce muscle bone strength great storage fat , particularly unfavourable site liver within abdomen ( visceral fat ) , rather beneath skin ( subcutaneous fat ) . Treatment GHD achieve administration GH replacement therapy , give daily subcutaneous injection , generally reverse symptom . Due high cost , patient start GH replacement depend impact GHD quality life . Patients must severely affected eligible replacement therapy . Patients screen quality life use well validate , disease specific questionnaire ( AGHDA , Adult Growth hormone deficiency questionnaire ) specific criterion govern whether patient GHD warrant GH replacement also whether continue treatment ( NICE guideline : Growth hormone deficiency ( adult ) - human growth hormone ( TA64 ) ) . This study specifically determine whether mechanism action GH exert beneficial effect metabolism ( within adipose tissue skeletal muscle ) involve change serum FGF21 concentration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All evaluation determine eligibility study growth hormone replacement perform part routine clinical care . It emphasise research specific screen test perform . Patients deem eligible entry study , decline participate research , still commence growth hormone line routine clinical care . Inclusion criterion : Patients confirm GH deficiency deem eligible GH replacement assess AGHDA QOL questionnaire . Exclusion criterion : Claustrophobia significant metal work contraindication MRI scanning . Withdrawal criterion : Patients withdraw study discontinue growth hormone replacement therapy clinical reason .</criteria>
