	<brief_summary>The purpose study three fold . First determine ideal dose dexamethasone intraoperatively reduce acute pain opioid consumption . Second determine dexamethasone time surgery reduce chronic pain follow total knee arthroplasty finally determine pro-inflammatory environment make patient susceptible chronic pain surgery dexamethasone alter environment . Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty randomize four group ( 0mg , 6mg , 12mg 24mg dexamethasone ) assessment make acute chronic pain quality life measure . Blood sample draw assess Interleukin level Macrophage sorting . For primary efficacy endpoint reduction opioid consumption 24 hour surgery dexamethasone regimen group compare standard care group use t-test . For comparison secondary efficacy endpoint , t-test , Chi-square test Fisher 's Exact test use . Risks study include risk venipuncture intravenous dexamethasone administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase IV single center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , dose response study design evaluate optimum dose dexamethasone administer analgesic total knee arthroplasty surgery . Randomization perform use computer software randomization order write enclose envelope study office . A total 40 patient randomized receive different dos dexamethasone intravenously induction anesthesia dose repeat 24 hour later . The dose group : 0mg , 6mg , 12mg , 24mg . The group evenly divide 10 subject group . Patients care use establish standard care anesthetic multi modal analgesia pathway use clinically Duke University Medical Center . Knee arthroplasty generally occur patient 65 year age inclusion criterion age 55 year old include study . Regional anesthesia technically challenge morbidly obese patient . Because increased failure rate regional anesthesia morbidly obese patient upper limit BMI 40 include study design . Anesthetic regime . The anesthesia standard care apart administration study drug . Study Drug . After randomization first dose intravenous dexamethasone administer anesthesia care team immediately surgery . The subject study personnel blind dose . The patient sedate study personnel operate room . The dose record anesthesia record . The second dose dexamethasone prescribe PI . This prescribe electronically administer subject floor 24 hour first dose . Surgery The surgery proceed normally difference study . Postoperative Pain Management Patients group receive standard care postoperative analgesic regimen . Blood Samples Blood drawn preop hold ( Time 0 ) Interleukin 6 , Interleukin10 macrophage sort . Blood sample repeat Interleukin 6 Interleukin10 10-14 , 22-26 33-39hours surgery . Blood sample macrophage sort repeat 33-39hours . The total blood collect 30ml day surgery 10 ml post operative day 1 overall total 40cc .</detailed_description>
