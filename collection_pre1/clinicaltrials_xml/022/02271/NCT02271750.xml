	<detailed_description>Introduction Dementia The estimate prevalence dementia Denmark 85.000 ( 2011 ) global prevalence close 36 million ( 2010 ) . Furthermore number predict double next 20 year , primarily due demographic ageing . The cost dementia account 1 % world 's GDP - perspective challenge current healthcare system national economy ( 1,2,3 ) . Dementia include number progressive degenerative brain disease . Dementia characterize progressive deterioration cognition , function behavior sufficiently severe compromise social occupational functioning . Dementia characterize loss episodic memory , difficulty name word finding , apraxia , executive dysfunction change personality mood . The common cause dementia Alzheimer 's disease ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) . The pathogenesis Alzheimer dementia remain elusive . For many year pathophysiological hallmark Alzheimers dementia toxicity cause accumulation proteins amyloid-beta plaque phosphorylated tau associate neurofibrillary tangle . However , theory base genetic `` early-onset familial Alzheimers '' , less frequent inherited type . Currently , hypotheses pathogenesis Alzheimer actually disagree amyloid-beta theory . Thus , need increase understand mechanisms leading common form Alzheimer 's disease . A good understanding disease may enable early diagnosis importantly , causal treatment Alzheimer oppose merely symptomatic option available day ( 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) . IGF-system One main area recent research dementia role neurotrophic support , research area embrace insulin insulin-like growth factor system . Insulin IGF system important normal somatic growth , development , tissue repair regeneration throughout life . Earlier study indicate impairment cerebral glucose utilization energy metabolism represent early abnormality precede accompany initial stage cognitive impairment . However , type 2 diabetes , often characterize insulin resistance , establish cause Alzheimer although correlation insulin resistance cognitive dysfunction . The cellular signaling pathway IGF-I IGF-II overlap great extent pathway use insulin , three protein bind receptor though different affinity . Several study show ratio concentration IGF-I cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) plasma ( CSF/plasma ratio ) reduce Alzheimer patient . Interestingly , IGF-I seem promote amyloid-beta clearance . IGF-II le study expressed brain development adulthood decline age . In brain relative concentration high hippocampus . ( 10-14 ) . Furthermore , group novel data indicate CSF , IGF-II important growth factor come activate IGF-I receptor ( Mia-Maiken Kallestrup et al. , manuscript preparation ) . Memory Memory question consolidation whereby newly learn labile information become strong resilient disruption . This process depend de novo RNA protein synthesis function cAMP response element bind protein ( CREB ) CCAAT enhancer bind protein ( C/EBP ) , transcription factor . Former study show bind site C/EBP promoter region IGF-II gene liver tissue ( 10 ) . IGF-II memory To solve puzzle dementia important explain early change biomarkers early stage dementia thereby possibly reveal pathogenesis possible treatment . An experiment rat memory might already take first step towards . It demonstrate administration IGF-II rat significantly enhance memory retention prevents forget . Furthermore inhibitory avoidance learning ( paradigm subject learn associate particular context occurrence ) lead increase hippocampal expression IGF-II . Finally , yet importantly , injection recombinant IGF-II hippocampus train memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention prevent forgetting ( 10 ) . Neurotrophic growth factor : The human adult brain able generate new neuron even though limited capacity . Possibly capacity depend sufficient neurotrophic growth factor . The neurotrophic factor include nerve growth factor ( NGF ) brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . BDNF important neuronal survival , synaptic plasticity memory , along tendency increase level BDNF early stage Alzheimer 's indicate connection . The increase BDNF early stage Alzheimer 's could reflection compensation neurodegeneration . During progression Alzheimer 's level BDNF decrease level healthy elderly people . NGF induce growth neuron maintain neuron proliferation interact growth factor . Levels NGF serum , CSF brain seem differ Alzheimer 's patient normal elderly patient seem vary different brain region . Finally expression pattern BDNF NGF highly correlate amyloid concentration ( 15 ) . Cluster differentiation 163 ( CD-163 ) CD-163 scavenger receptor , recognize uptakes macromolecule hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex level indication monocyte-macrophage activation . The soluble form receptor call sCD163 find plasma . Plasma sCD163 level up-regulated large range inflammatory disease ( 16 ) . Hypothesis Patients dementia deregulate concentration and/or activity IGF-I , IGF-II , NGF , BDNF sCD-163 cerebrospinal fluid . Purpose To define concentration biological activity IGF-I , IGF-II , BDNF , NGF sCD-163 cerebrospinal fluid serum patient Alzheimer 's compare control ( patient unspecified neurological symptom disease ) . Method Study population All participate patient must age 18 year old . They exclude study case acute bacterial neuro infection acute bleed The study population project include patient establish suspected dementia , undergo lumbar puncture Department Neurology Aarhus University Hospital part diagnostic work-up . Controls include patient unspecified neurological symptom disease undergo lumbar puncture Department Neurology Aarhus University Hospital part diagnostic work-up irrespective study . The patient receive information research project ask give content participation . The participation imply extraction 2-3 ml extra spinal fluid extra blood sample ( 10ml ) , use analysis IGF system component neurotrophic factor . Participants receive form payment , receive compensation transportation . At time diagnostic work-up consequently research project take patient mental physical condition consideration . The research project carry accord Act Processing Personal Data . At Department Neurology Aarhus University Hospital , Dementia Clinic use lumbar puncture diagnostic tool approximately three patient per week . It estimate 1/3 1/2 patient end diagnosis Alzheimer patient ultimately include project period 36-40 week . Overall study period enable inclusion 50-60 patient . Analysis The spinal fluid serum analyse Medical Research Laboratory . The spinal fluid blood sample deposit research biobank Aarhus University Hospital . The plan carry biochemical analysis time sample collect . In case know knowledge field intend deposit sample 5 year project . If sample use another project The National Committee Health Research Ethics Danish Data Protection Agency demand application . The immunological concentration IGF-I IGF-II measure validated in-house analysis . Furthermore , Aarhus University Hospital unique technique , whereby possible measure bioactivity IGF-I -II cerebrospinal fluid . The technique base cell-based in-house bioassay develop 2003 . This method take account large part IGF-I IGF-II bound proteins thereby consider biological inactive . The bioassay able measure ability serum cerebrospinal fluid stimulate IGF-IR vitro make method much specific . Pilot investigation group show possible measure biological IGF-IR activity cerebrospinal fluid . It proven : ) The biological IGF vitro activity cerebrospinal fluid primarily come IGF-II ii ) The biological activity far higher expect compare simple measure concentration owe low concentration IGF-binding protein . The immunological concentration IGF-binding protein measure commercial in-house develop immunoassay ligand blot technique . The concentration NGF , BDNF sCD-163 spinal fluid serum analyse already establish technique spinal fluid examine spectrometry . Clinical examination The clinical examination perform natural part examination dementia . This include medical history objective examination , CT scan cognitive test include MMSE ( mini-mental state examination ) ACE ( Adenbrooke´s Cognitive Examination ) . In case doubt extend examination perform neurophysiologist . Information clinical examination form medical record use evaluate possibility dementia diagnosis include progression disease thereby evaluate possible deregulated concentration and/or activity IGF-I , IGF-II , NGF , BDNF sCD-163 cerebrospinal fluid . Power The bioactivity IGF cerebrospinal fluid patient dementia earlier determine . Pilot data indicate bioactivity IGF-II healthy people ( n= 9 ) 57 ± 13 ng/ml ( mean ± SD ) . If difference patient group set 26ng/ml ( ̴ 2 x SD ) inclusion 10 person per group give project power 90 % use ANOVA significant level 5 % . It therefore choose include 15 patient project . Statistic The program ANOVA use statistical analysis . Parametric non-parametric test use depend normal distribution data . In statistical analysis 5 % level significance use . Perspective As early mentioned cost dementia already account 1 % world 's GDP prevalence dementia expect double within next twenty year . The progressive nature disease mean estimate 43 % case dementia need high level care ( equivalent nursing home ) . Therefore , obvious prevention , delay onset , slow progression potential curability crucial factor well-being patient relatives also economy health care system . ( 2,17 ) This research project base recent theory dementia disease IGF-system , oppose study able measure concentration well bioactivity . This potentially open knowledge dynamic dementia thereby potentially reveal understanding pathogenesis medical target dementia . Ethical consideration Ethical consideration general The test perform patient involve research project lumbar puncture blood sample . Both test perform part diagnostic workup irrespective study . It involve risk perform lumbar puncture , include post lumbar puncture headache incidence 12 % , common young patient . Most frequently , headache short duration may cure application blood-patch . The use needle lumbar puncture cause temporary lumbar pain accumulation Ethical consideration patient dementia The concerned patient group cause extended ethical consideration . As mention earlier symptom dementia cause memory loss , difficulty find right word understand people say . As questionable whether patient able make independent decision whether participate project ( 6 ) . All dementia patient test perform part standard diagnostic work dementia . Therefore study introduce additional investigation defend ethical aspect study . In consideration low risk involve project , mild dementia form high prevalence seriousness disease evaluate project ethically acceptable . Furthermore great importance examine pathogenesis possible target dementia . Aim Positive , negative well inconclusive result study publish . The result foundation research year report article publication English write peer review journal .</detailed_description>
