	<brief_summary>There grow body evidence implicate inflammation mechanism disease progression reduce survival patient advance cancer . Elevated c-reactive protein level show associate reduced performance status , specific cancer relate symptom reduce overall survival . C-reactive protein level surrogate IL-6 expression . IL-6 part inflammatory signature predict cancer recurrence . VeriStrat® multivariate test measure protein expression relate host/tumor interaction mediate inflammation . The investigator hope examine relationship quality life outcome per FACT-L survey correlate change c-reactive protein level VeriStrat® status . The hypothesis study remarkable survival benefit Temel study mediate reduced inflammation improvement symptom control .</brief_summary>
