	<brief_summary>Introduction To get egg vestment fertilize oocyte , spermatozoon us acrosomal enzyme . When Intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection ( ICSI ) perform , acrosomal enzyme introduce spermatozoa inside ooplasme . The fate enzyme , normally never enter oocyte , know . But impair embryo development . Indeed , although ICSI outcome satisfactory human , series study many specie ( mouse , hamster , cattle , horse ) demonstrate deleterious effect introduction acrosomal material oocyte cytoplasm , embryo fetal development . These study also show two thing : - The big acrosome , deleterious effect introduction egg . - And induction acrosome reaction ( AR ) prior ICSI significantly improve embryonic development number baby bear embryo transfer case mouse . The microinjection acrosome react sperm increase 40 70 % percentage pup bear per embryo transfer . Hypothesis : It possible improve ICSI outcome , term baby bear human , induction AR prior microinjection . After study several technique , choose physiologic technique acrosome induction . The induction acrosome reaction prior ICSI improve utero fetal development decrease rate miscarriage pregnancy arrest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection ( ICSI ) produce 70 % fertilize oocytes zygote mostly develop normally . To perform ICSI , spermatozoon take sperm suspension gradient migration . It immobilize break flagellum use micropipette , introduce oocyte cytoplasm . The rate spontaneous acrosome reaction human less 20 % . Two study percentage acrosome react immobilized sperm show 95 % destabilization membrane 17.8 % make full RA . In word , microinjected 10 spermatozoon , 2 completely rid acrosome material . All others introduce oocyte acrosomal material . But material normally enter oocyte since acrosome reaction prerequisite passage zona pellucida surround egg . The importance use acrosome-reacted spermatozoon success ICSI previously highlight several animal specie . It demonstrate induction acrosome reaction mice lead high fertilization rate ( 30 % 60 % ) . It similar , rabbit horse . Kimura et al . also report mouse oocyte inject acrosome-intact rabbit hamster sperm exhibit nuclear activation cessation embryonic development without reach two-cell stage . This `` cytotoxicity '' sperm disappears release acrosome injection . In another study , detrimental effect oocyte survival presence acrosome injection sperm head demonstrate golden hamster . All oocyte microinjected acrosome-intact sperm dead , injected acrosome react sperm survive , also develop stage two pronucleus 79 % case help get live birth ( 19 % ) . The team Yanagimachi report study potentially dangerous effect incorporation sperm acrosome different specie within mouse oocyte . According author , harmful component would probably enzymes trypsin-like acrosine hyaluronidase , since injection mimic effect ICSI acrosome-intact sperm . In study , confirm toxic effect correlate size acrosome therefore content protease enzymes . The toxic effect acrosome content describe explicitly Morozumi Yanagimachi . It induce deformation oocyte irregular appearance , edema cytolysis pseudo-vacuolated cytoplasm appearance . Furthermore , establish damage cause exogenous acrosomales enzymes correlate oocyte cytoskeleton disruption aberrant accumulation microtubule cortex oocyte . In addition morphological ultrastructural alteration oocyte , incorporation acrosome may result lack nuclear activation oocyte . Kasai et al . report completion oocyte meiosis occur fast sperm release acrosome . Similarly , increase fertilization rate ICSI acrosome react sperm observed pig . The study Morozumi et al . also demonstrated induction acrosome reaction sperm several specie prior ICSI result acceleration oocyte activation , manifest human spermatozoon . This evidence significant difference profile calcium oscillation ICSI acrosome-intact acrosome-reacted sperm . Calcium wave record oocyte inject acrosome-reacted spermatozoon characterize early onset amplitude high frequency . In contrast , calcium response abnormally delay oocyte inject acrosome-intact sperm . Thus , alter calcium oscillation , `` key '' oocyte activation signal ICSI , cause abnormal pre-implantation embryo development blastocyst stage . Indeed , proportion live healthy mice birth increase 40 % 71 % , intact acrosome-reacted sperm microinjected , respectively . These study also show two thing : - The introduction acrosomal material harmful quantity large compare oocyte volume . There therefore interest systematically reduce amount material introduce oocyte cytoplasm improve embryonic development . - The second thing induction acrosome reaction ICSI greatly improve embryonic development therefore number baby bear embryo transfer . Although ICSI human give satisfactory result , rate infant obtain embryo low IVF embryo transfer . Hence , possibility improve result ICSI induction acrosome reaction prior microinjection . After several study use incubation spermatozoon follicular fluid ( FF ) partner induce spermatozoa acrosome reaction ( Karim Rahal , 2011 Master Thesis 2 ) . FF indeed potent inducer AR . There problem traceability since FF patient use sperm husband . This technic applied poor semen . Finally , technique use easy routine , since follicular fluid always recover oocyte retrieval thus available . 2 . Hypothesis A preliminary study run human microinjection spermatozoon select acrosomal status birefringence microscopy . It show improve implantation rate 24,4 % 39 % . We therefore hypothesize improvement implantation rate embryo obtain ICSI acrosomal induction well reduction miscarriage rate may result improved clinical pregnancy outcome birth rate 10 % .</detailed_description>
