	<brief_title>The ATTAIN Study : A Therapeutic Trial Afatinib In Neoadjuvant Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take afatinib mouth 1 time day least 14 day surgery . You take least 1 hour 2 hour meal . You sign separate consent form describe surgery risk detail . You keep diary take pill . You bring diary visit , along pill bottle study staff count remain pill . Some side effect , diarrhea skin rash , occur almost patient . If severe side effect , dose may lower . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week take afatinib : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Within week surgery : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You PET-CT scan check status disease . - You MUGA scan check heart function . On day surgery , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw research test , include look tumor cell may blood . Leftover tissue surgery use biomarker test . Length Treatment : You take last dose study drug within 24 hour surgery . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : At 30 day surgery : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . It possible study staff call instead visit . You ask . The call last 5 minute . If side effect study drug time follow-up visit call , may additional follow-up doctor think need . The follow-up test , procedure , schedule doctor 's decision depend side effect . This investigational study . Afatinib FDA approve commercially available first treatment patient specific type NSCLC spread . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 20 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
