	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory peripheral neuropathy characterize progressive deterioration muscle strength , loss sensibility , diminish absent reflex impair fine motor control . Often cause demyelination suitable treatment damage axon may also occur especially case insufficient treatment . Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN ) diagnose electrophysiological examination , show sign demyelination conduction block . Moreover , CIDP elevate level protein cerebrospinal fluid MMN detection anti-GM1 antibody blood support diagnosis . The patient suffer disable diffuse weakness muscle . The diagnosis primarily rely neurophysiological examination , however , diagnosis may difficult make due great clinical variation insensitive examination method include lack biomarkers . Treatment CIDP MMN CIDP MMN immune mediate neuropathy first choice treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , although mechanisms underlying effect IVIG yet clarify . Previous study implies Fc receptor natural killer cell target IVIG , cytotoxic activity NK cell suppress , partly cause dose-dependent decline number circulate NK cell . Furthermore , dose-dependent blockage CD16 present . Subcutaneous administration immunoglobulin ( SCIG ) study alternative route IVIG CIDP MMN . The conclusion SCIG feasible , safe effective . Thus SCIG improve muscle strength , walk performance disability score compare placebo IVIG . SCIG local side effect compare IVIG furthermore majority patient prefer SCIG IVIG , autonomy maintenance stable level muscle performance . It well know around 30 % CIDP patient year longer need treatment maintain muscle strength . Immunoglobulin treatment costly may , administrate intravenously , induce severe side effect ( e.g . thromboembolism , hemolytic anemia exfoliative dermatitis ) . Therefore patient clearly respond treat . On hand , important treat time reduce morbidity disability . Present examination method Patients suspect CIDP MMN diagnose base medical history , clinical examination neurophysiological finding . However , diagnosis include plethora criterion , illustrate difficulty develop exact standard CIDP MMN may variable clinical presentation . Furthermore , describe earlier electrophysiological examination recommend patient suspect CIDP MMN . The electrophysiological criterion consist partial conduction block , conduction velocity slowing , dispersion distance dependent reduction compound motor action potential amplitude . As medical history clinical examination , electrophysiological examination always conclusive . The Koski criterion criterion EFNS /PNS two different set criterion , frequently use . Even important keep mind Koski criterion sensitivity specificity 63 99 percent , whereas EFNS sensitivity specificity 81 97 percent . In addition , early treatment CIDP make progression difficult characterize temporal component change . It still controversial whether CIDP MMN specific disease entity rather syndrome . MMN many way similar CIDP oppose CIDP MMN characterize sensory disturbance , slow progression asymmetric presentation . The specific cause disease still unknown generally accept pathology CIDP MMN immunologically base multiple trigger . According theory cellular humoral part immune system involve . Several inflammatory biomarkers study relation CIDP Including cytokine CSF . The study measure Interleukin ( IL ) -12 IL-15 ( major growth differentiation factor Th-1 cell ) IL-17 ( marker Th-17 cell expansion activation ) . Especially IL-12 find involve potential marker immune activation CIDP . Nerve biopsy also use search situ biomarkers . The conclusion even though total number inflammatory cell distinguish well CIDP non-inflammatory neuropathy , pattern macrophage cluster around endoneurial vessel could simple marker inflammation good sensitivity specificity . Furthermore , another study find CIDP associated high level haptoglobin CSF . The underlying mechanism behind yet clarify . Nevertheless , open haptoglobin possible useful biomarker . Cluster differentiation 19 ( CD-19 ) - promising B cell target ! A study spontaneous autoimmune polyneuropathy ( SAP ) B7-2 knock- non-obese diabetes mouse , animal model mimic chronic progressive form human CIDP , show treatment anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) result depletion B-cells plasmablast accompany decreased serum IgG IgM level depletion P0-specific plasmablast B-cells . CD-19 protein find surface normal neoplastic B-cells , early pre-B cell stage development early stage plasma cell differentiation . The majority B-cell lineage malignancy express CD19 high level . Therefore , CD19 broad marker B-cell lineage represent potentially important target unconjugated mAb immunoteraphy . In another study stimulate CD19 B cell isolate blood sample CIDP patient , B-cell immunoreactivity enhance within 3 day IVIG infusion , B-cell level CIDP downregulated . Cluster differentiation 163 ( CD-163 ) - new way measure CIDP MMN ? CD-163 scavenger receptor ( recognizes uptake macromolecule ) mark monocyte-macrophage activation . CD163 work macrophage receptor hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex . The soluble form receptor call sCD163 find plasma , find regulate large range inflammatory disease . Values Increased strongly ( &gt; 20mg/l ) see disease like macrophage activate syndrome , haemophagocytic syndrome acute hepatic failure . Furthermore , level sCD163 reflect activity disease . Patients increase high value find unfavorable prognosis . Increased value ( 5-20 mg/l ) see hepatic disease , sepsis Gaucher 's disease . Septic patient value great 10 mg/l 10 time great risk fatal outcome . Values slightly increase ( 3-5 mg/l ) often see inflammatory infectious condition cancer . Hypothesis Patients treat SCIG CIDP MMN high concentration sCD163 CD19 cerebrospinal fluid serum compare healthy control subject related disease severity . Patients newly diagnose CIDP MMN high level sCD163 CD19 , patient treat regularly SCIG . Purpose To define concentration sCD163 CD19 cerebrospinal fluid serum patient CIDP MMN compare control ( patient unspecified neurological symptom disease ) . Method Data Sources Data use study originate several source , Danish Civil Registration Registry , Danish National Patient Registry Danish national prescription registry . Information medical record include use project include past medical history , actual use drug , result biochemical analysis brain imaging , abnormalities clinical examination conclusion doctor diagnostic workup . Study population The study population consist four subgroup : Recruitment All participant receive information project ask give content participation . Participants receive write oral information study . The oral information take place Department Neurology , Aarhus Universitetshospital . Moreover , pamphlet `` Før du deltager et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forsøg '' ( participate clinical trial ) hand . The information give consultant Henning Andersen , MD Lars Makrvardsen stud . med Malalai Musleh . It possible participant bring companion offer one week consider participation . Access patient record request , provide write information material . If new knowledge disadvantage participate study appear participant inform immediately . Moreover , participant inform evaluation study bring knowledge general health status patient , unless clearly reject patient . By end study possible participant contact study coordinator get information study result . Participants receive form payment , receive compensation transportation The participation imply extraction 3-5 ml spinal fluid blood sample 10 ml , use analysis certain biomarkers , sCD163 , CD19 myelin protein . Other examination Patients CIDP treatment SCIG IVIG plus drug-naïve CIDP patient undergo clinical examination follow : - Neuropathy Impairment Score ( NIS ) - Overall Disability Sum Score ( ODSS ) - Neuropathy Symptom Score ( NSS ) Disorders treatment contraindicate lumbar puncture . In case include patient turn meet exclusion criterion analyse spinal fluid , patient replace new patient . At time diagnostic work-up consequently research project investigator respect patient mental physical condition . The research project carry accord Act Processing Personal Data , furthermore , project submit common regional information system Region Midtjylland . Analyses The spinal fluid serum analyse Department Clinical Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital . The spinal fluid blood sample deposit research biobank Aarhus University Hospital . The plan carry biochemical analysis time sample collect . In end project , sample pseudo anonymised . Any excess biological material transfer biobank future research . The concentration sCD163 spinal fluid serum analyze already establish technique Department Clinical Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital . The concentration CD19 spinal fluid serum analyze establish technique Department Immunology , Aarhus University Hospital . Power Statistical analysis Because rareness CIDP MMN number patient relevant make Power calculation . The program STATA use statistical analysis . Parametric non-parametric test use depend normal distribution data . In statistical analysis 5 % level significance use . Perspectives Due many clinical variant inflammatory polyneuropathies due lack biomarkers , remain difficult diagnose CIDP . It important identify new method diagnosis monitoring patient CIDP . This may also enable good prediction prognosis level treatment need . The pathology CIDP still unknown know immune mediate . In several study sCD163 show regulated large range inflammatory disease suggest sCD163 relevant biomarker CIDP . It also prove CD19 promise B-cell target development disease-modifying agent autoimmune neuropathy . These finding use diagnostic marker patient CIDP MMN . Ethical consideration All participant inform orally write study receive consideration view whether want participate . Signed consent give . The test perform patient involve research project lumbar puncture , blood sample clinical examination . A lumbar puncture procedure use collect cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) analysis . CSF promise source biomarkers CIDP since proximal nerve root , affect early disease , close anatomical contact CSF space . During procedure hollow needle use penetrate spinal canal level third- to-fourth fourth-to-fifth lumbar vertebra low back . CSF drip needle collect . It involve risk perform lumbar puncture , include post lumbar puncture headache incidence 12 % , common young patient . Most frequently , headache short duration may cure application blood -patch . Moreover , lumbar puncture cause temporary lumbar pain accumulation blood underneath skin . There low risk bleed epidural space compression spinal nerve even low risk infection ( meningitis meningoencephalitis ) . However , important highlight lumbar puncture part routine diagnostic workout neuropathy . However , CIDP patient treat SCIG IVIG lumbar puncture research purpose . There risk associate collection extra sample spinal fluid blood . In consideration low risk involve project , seriousness cost disease potential identify relevant biomarker CIDP , consider project ethically acceptable .
