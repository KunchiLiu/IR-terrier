	<brief_title>Newborn Infection Control Care Initiative Health Facilities Accelerate Reduction Newborn Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study incorporate mixed method : formative ( qualitative ) research , step wedge cluster randomize intervention trial process evaluation . It anticipate result study provide data policy level action newborn survival Cambodia setting similar health outcome . The study may contribute potential scale link model community-facility care newborn . Globally , infection cause approximately 35 % newborn mortality [ 1 ] . Verbal autopsy data collect Svay Rieng province 2009 show bacterial sepsis likely cause 40 % newborn death , far large category ( exceed next high cause 17 % ) [ 2 ] . The NICCI intervention address number barrier identify Royal Government Cambodia USAID improve neonatal survival , include capacity performance health provider deliver newborn care strengthen training ; upgrading hygiene enhance infection control facility ; increase community engagement demand delivery health service newborns improve referral process address barrier timely care seek . The propose study address crucial gap post-natal care link community ( via Village Health Support Groups ) Health Center staff follow mother newborn first week life Quality Assurance : Investigators include provision management data collection include appropriate procedure Standard Operating Practices document . Training data collector start study ensure quality consistency supervisory monitoring data collection occur monthly . Data Checks Data Source Verification : Data collect , check , enter data management system National Institute Public Health . All participant identify unique identifier link database . All study data collect project staff outcome depend subject compliance refusal answer project survey ( although study participant always right decline answer survey base informed consent principle ) . Data collect community transfer central database NIPH enter database use REDcap comparable program compatible data management capacity NIPH . The investigator use special screen filter invalid entry identification miss value data entry verification . Analysis conduct SPSS and/or SAS . Sample Size : Using cause newborn mortality primary outcome step wedge design sample size calculation ( power analysis ) cluster randomize trial , investigator require total sample size 1,938 subject base 80 % power , 5 % significance level , 10 % rate loss-to-follow detect 20 % reduction baseline neonatal mortality 40 deaths/1,000 live birth target province intra-class correlation coefficient 0.0007256 . Withdrawal Study : Study subject may withdraw voluntarily participation time . Participants may also voluntarily withdraw receive study intervention time . The study team attempt follow withdraw study order collect safety data applicable . Termination Study : Although unlikely , discontinuation would occur statistically significant increase decrease neonatal death detect intervention area reason correlate way content intervention . Formative Study : The investigator conduct qualitative data collection FGD staff 15 health center , one-on-one interview 20 VHSG 30 mother newborn . The study allow u get overall knowledge knowledge practice newborn HC community implementation phase . The baseline data collect comparison cluster course intervention phase , environmental assessment checklist use health facility investigator use start intervention intervention , plan formative research . Intervention Study : Determine 1st HC conduct intervention . The investigator randomly select one health center ( HC ) among 16 HCs . For second subsequent HCs , investigator select HC close first HC , investigator continue process 16 HC select . Training HC Staff : training first HC ( happen first month intervention phase ) , MCH ( Maternal Child Health ) Focal Person SC conduct training HC Coordinators/other project staff observe training . Subsequent training HC staff conduct HC Coordinators supervision support Provincial Health Department ( PHD ) MCH Focal Person SC . NICCI conduct train one HC month . Before training start , trainer introduce HC Data Form ( relevant part ) collect baseline data trainee . This training go period 16 month 16 health center . Training VHSG : first month intervention phase , investigator also organize train VHSG HC 's coverage ( one HC time ) . This training go period 16 month . Before training start , trainer introduce VHSG Data Form ( relevant part ) collect baseline data trainee . Blood Samples Sick Newborn : The investigator anticipate pathogenic bacteria isolate 10 % 200-300 blood sample test 2 year period intervention-control study . HC Coordinators Conduct Supportive Supervision HC Staff Intervention Clusters : two HC Coordinators jointly conduct monthly supportive supervision HC Invention Cluster . During supervision , HC Coordinators perform following : Check whether NICCI 's training/education material HC available use HC staff ; discus HC staff whether staff recall 6 newborn danger sign hygiene message ( hygiene mothers/newborn/home hygiene HC staff include knowledge infection control ) ; re-enforce HC staff ( observe applicable ) provide education mother newborn care , newborn danger sign , hygiene home ; re-enforce practice infection control accord NICCI training material , check whether HC staff skill materials/supplies implement infection control activity write training material ; review birth register ANC register assist HC staff care coordination assist VHSG Coordinators pregnant woman enrollment , e.g . HC communicate effectively VHSG ; check whether HC staff , provide ANC service , ask pregnant woman meet VHSG village , pregnant woman meet VHSG , HC need provide information pregnant woman relevant VHSG ( call VHSG telephone ) , HC Coordinators assist activity compare name pregnant woman HC ANC register enrollment list ; check whether HC staff do work care coordination VHSG ( e.g . call VHSG mother/newborn leave HC ) inform VHSG pregnant woman enrollment train ; re-enforce practice confirm HC staff HC staff do properly ; check whether HC update enrollment list ( HC staff know whether woman come delivery study participant ) . HC Coordinators need work VHSG Coordinators ensure HC staff date list ( e.g . month precede month HC Coordinator conduct supervision ) . The two HC Coordinators must supportive supervision book record activity HC Coordinators do supervision visit , clear supervision date name HC . The record supervision visit end summary finding follow action . HC Coordinators Conduct Weekly Visit Each HC Under Comparison Clusters : purpose visit collect information enrol participant birth delivery HC project information interview mothers/newborn villages 14th 28th day delivery . In visit , HC Coordinators collect information share information Data Manager . The Data Manager register information database provide information VHSG Coordinators VHSG Coordinators meet mother/newborn 14th day 28th day . The information include : participant name ID , date delivery . During visit , HC Coordinators also provide date enrollment list HC . It also option HC Coordinators think secure activity without visit HC communicate HC mobile phone VHSG Coordinators Conduct Supportive Supervision VHSG Intervention Cluster : VHSG Coordinator assign responsible approx . 54 village , need conduct supervision village every two month ; supervision conduct village VHSG already train NICCI . With guidance SC , VHSG Coordinators develop write schedule VHSG supervision ( two monthly schedule , equal one round supervision ) . During supervision eligible village ( meet VHSG ) , VHSG Coordinators perform following : Check VHSG Pregnant Women Register see whether VHSG conduct proper registration : complete register correctly , seem register pregnant woman ( accord estimate number pregnant woman village ) Check VHSG whether communicate relevant HC : mother come home care coordination , whether HC inform pregnant woman village register contacted VHSG . Discuss VHSG knowledge , re-enforce knowledge : 6 newborn danger sign , newborn care training/education material , home hygiene family , message care seek ; check whether VHSG use NICCI 's training/education/thermometer material re-enforce use education material necessary . Discuss whether VHSG conduct three visit mother/newborn : 24hours , 3rd , 7th day , discuss VHSG whether understand use VHSG Home Visit 's material . Enroll/interview new pregnant woman ( use Consent Form Enrollment Baseline Form ) , provide complete form Data Manager . Each VHSG Coordinator must supervision record book , record activity do supervision visit village ( name VHSG ) , summary finding clear follow action . SC design supervision Record Book VHSG Coordinators . VHSG Coordinators Enroll Pregnant Women Comparison Clusters : VHSG Coordinator travel designate village comparison cluster every two month . During visit , VHSG Coordinators perform following : Discuss VHSG assist complete pregnant woman registration Meet pregnant woman ( support VHSG ) meet criterion enrollment ( e.g . last semester pregnancy ) enroll pregnant woman use Consent Form , Enrollment Baseline Form . HC Coordinators Conduct Data Collection HC : two HC Coordinators jointly conduct data collection HC every six month , use HC Data Collection Form . After complete , HC Coordinators send Form Data Manager his/her verification data entry . SC Data Manager work closely assist HC Coordinators development data collection plan data collection round ( one round last six month ) . The Data Manager help SC closely monitor HC Coordinators adhere data collection plan provide prompt feedback SC HC Coordinators . VHSG Coordinators Conduct Data Collection VHSG : VHSG Coordinator conduct interview VHSG work designate village ( approx . 50 village per VHSG Coordinator ) every six month , use VHSG Data Form . After complete Form , VHSG Coordinators send complete Form Data Manager his/her verification data entry . SC Data Manager work closely assist VHSG Coordinators development data collection plan data collection round ( one round last six month ) , Data Manager help SC closely monitor VHSG Coordinators adhere data collection plan provide prompt feedback SC VHSG Coordinators . VHSG Coordinators Conduct Data Collection Mothers/Caretakers : VHSG Coordinator ensure register mother/newborn ( designate village ) interview 14th 28th day delivery . To know whether VHSG Coordinator mother/newborn interview month , VHSG Coordinator need work closely data manager generate list mother/newborn visit 14th 28th day .</detailed_description>
