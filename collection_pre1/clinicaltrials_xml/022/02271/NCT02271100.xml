	<brief_summary>This study intend determine whether ultrasound image improve ability place spinal epidural needle obstetric anesthesia . By evaluate use ultrasound placement epidural catheter investigator hope answer two question : 1 . How traditional technique base palpation compare one use ultrasound place epidural catheter ? 2 . Does ultrasound reduce one potential risk epidural placement ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Use Ultrasound Epidural Catheter Placement Comparison With Palpation Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study contain two phase : 1 . A prospective , randomize , blind comparison ultrasound image versus palpation epidural catheter insertion labor woman . 2 . A prospective , single cohort , blind trial ass whether ultrasound image provide reliable placement L3 vertebra . The initial phase investigation randomize comparison ultrasound versus palpation . Patients enrol early labor randomize epidural place either technique . The technique choose computer-generated randomization list maintain opaque sequentially numbered envelope . Description placement technique . The primary outcome number epidural catheter insert intended insertion site . The investigator also assess total time require epidural catheter placement , number attempt successful insertion , effectiveness epidural catheter labor pain control . Following completion enrollment first phase , second phase investigation enroll patient single-cohort ultrasound arm . The study use methodology initial phase , without randomization due single cohort . The primary outcome absolute number epidural catheter insert L3 vertebral body . The investigator also assess effectiveness ultrasound marking guide placement . Procedure placement technique After write , informed consent , standard patient preparation , epidural catheter place patient sit position junior resident . In ultrasound arm , patient first image use appropriate probe , identify ultrasound landmark mark skin . The skin prepped usual fashion , needle insert identified site direction determine ultrasound . In palpation arm , skin prepped needle insert use palpation-identified landmark guide needle . All catheter intend place L4-L5 interspace primary attempt . The L3-L4 interspace use secondary attempt . Assessment final position After insertion epidural catheter administration pain relief medication , patient group examine blind observer use ultrasound determine catheter insertion site likely insertion interspace . If , however , investigator discover use ultrasound placement epidural catheter may present great risk previously anticipate pregnant woman fetus , investigator stop study phase 1 proceed phase 2 .</detailed_description>
