	<brief_summary>The purpose study find optimal dose AllerT use treat moderate severe allergy due birch tree pollen . There 4 treatment group study ; 3 treatment group receive AllerT different dos 1 treatment group receive placebo . This study also assess effectiveness safety AllerT compare placebo relieve allergy symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Dose Regimens AllerT , Adults With Allergic Rhino-Conjunctivitis Birch Pollen Studied EEC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate dose-response trend three dos adjuvanted AllerT placebo reduce symptom allergic rhino-conjunctivitis subject expose birch tree pollen environmental exposure chamber ( EEC ) . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate three dose regimen AllerT , versus placebo reduce symptom allergic rhino-conjunctivitis subject expose birch tree pollen EEC . - To assess safety tolerability two month treatment three dose regiment AllerT ( 10 µg , 25 µg 50 µg Al ( OH ) 3 ) . - To explore immunological response AllerT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Minimum twoyear history moderate severe rhinoconjunctivitis exposure birch pollen need take symptomatic medication ( antihistamine , steroid ) pollen season , prior study enrollment . Sensitivity birch tree pollen confirm Screening follow criterion : Positive Skin Prick Test ( SPT ) birch pollen extract ( wheal ≥ 3 mm negative control ) . Negative control must ≤ 2 mm . Positive specific IgE CAP test Bet v 1 ( ≥ 0.7 kU/L ) . A qualify score least one two Baseline EEC Challenges : least one diary card 12/24 great Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score ( TRSS ) well either one diary card 6/12 great Total Nasal Symptom Score ( TNSS ) Total Ocular Symptom Score ( TOSS ) . Positive SPT AllerT ( wheal ≥ 3 mm negative control ) . Received specific immunotherapy : Any allergen within three year Screening visit . Birch tree pollen tree pollen mix include birch pollen time Screening visit . Clinically significant symptom due allergen birch pollen EEC challenge period ( eg , perennial allergy , allergy pollens overlap allergy season EEC period ) . Persistent uncontrolled asthma ; subject Forced Expiratory Volume ( FEV1 ) low 80 % predict value and/or subject chronic treatment asthma regular use inhale steroid . Subjects seasonal asthma may include . Subjects require occasional use inhale bronchodilator include . History birch pollen induce asthma . Note : A diagnosis isolated exercise induce bronchospasm control asthma ( Global Initiative Asthma [ GINA ] Step 1 ) trigger birch pollen constitute exclusion criterion . History document severe anaphylactic reaction ( Grade 4 World Allergy Organization [ WAO ] ) . History sinus disease include : Acute significant chronic sinusitis . History significant recurrent acute sinusitis , define two episode per year last two year , require antibiotic treatment . History chronic sinusitis , define sinus symptom last great 12 week include two major factor one major factor two minor factor . Major factor define facial pain pressure , nasal obstruction blockage , nasal discharge purulence discolor postnasal discharge , purulence nasal cavity , impaired loss smell . Minor factor define headache , fever , halitosis , fatigue , dental pain , cough , ear pain , pressure , fullness . Subjects tolerate Baseline EEC Challenge meet Baseline EEC Challenge inclusion criterion . Subjects history immunodeficiency condition might affect subject 's safety interpretation study result . Received immunosuppressive medication ( include oral corticosteroid ) within four week prior Screening , plan use trial period . Received systemic local antihistamine , oral inhaled corticosteroid antidepressant medication antihistamine effect within two week prior Screening . Subjects administration epinephrine contraindicate ( eg , subject acute chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease severe hypertension ) . Subjects treat betablockers form include topical ocular betablocker type medication .</criteria>
