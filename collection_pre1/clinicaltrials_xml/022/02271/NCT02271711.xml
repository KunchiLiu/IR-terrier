	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn infusion particular type patient ' white blood cell call natural killer ( NK ) cell reliably safely give patient brain tumor cell procedure expand ( increase ) number . Researchers also want learn NK cell infuse ommaya reservoir help control disease patient advance brain tumor . The ommaya reservoir catheter system NK cell infuse directly area brain call fourth ventricle lateral . This first study NK cell infuse fourth ventricle brain human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level NK cell base join study . Up 4 dose level NK cell test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose NK cell find . NK Cell Collection , Expansion , Infusion : Blood ( 10 tablespoon ) draw central venous catheter one , needle stick . Your NK cell process The Cell Therapy Laboratory GMP facility MD Anderson make increased number NK cell . Leftover blood process and/or extra NK cell beyond need study use study appearance function NK cell . Your NK cell destroy cell show form abnormal cell growth process unsafe infusion , find eligible receive infusion , leave study early . If already Ommaya catheter place lateral fourth ventricle brain , one place receive NK cell . You sign separate surgical consent form describe procedure detail . You receive NK cell 1 time week ( least 3 day apart ) first 3 week 4-week cycle . These infusion give 3 minute ommaya reservoir catheter . On day NK cell infusion , take follow drug low risk side effect : °You take Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth infusion . If doctor think need , take 4-6 hour later . Study Visits : The screening test may repeat NK cell infusion delay 30 day . If 4 week pass since MRI screening , need repeat receive NK cell Cycle 1 . Before receive first NK cell infusion Cycle 1 , spinal tap withdraw small amount CSF around spinal cord check tumor cell , 4 week pass since procedure last performed . A spinal tap ( also call lumbar puncture ) fluid surround spinal cord remove insert needle low back . The affected area numb local anesthetic procedure . If tumor cell find , procedure repeat receive NK cell Cycle 3 . Within 3 day receive first NK cell infusion Cycle 1 : °You MRI brain . Before receive first NK cell infusion Cycles 1 3 : °You physical exam . Within 7 day receive first NK cell infusion Cycles 1-3 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On day NK cell infusion Cycles 1-3 : - You physical exam . - Right NK cell infusion , CSF withdrawn ommaya reservoir use routine test . The CSF also use study tumor cell NK cell CSF . After finish Cycle 1 within 30 day finish Cycle 3 , MRI brain check status disease . You also MRI spine doctor think need . Length NK Cell Dosing : You may receive 3 cycle NK cell . You longer able receive NK cell disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 30 day complete Cycle 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You MRI brain spine check status disease . - You spinal tap withdraw small amount CSF around spinal cord check tumor cell . This investigational study . The expanded NK cell commercially available FDA approve . They currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain NK cell design work . Up 24 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
