	<brief_summary>Patients survive acute coronary syndrome high risk recurrent event death first month evolution . Aspirin , angiotensin-converting enzyme , beta-blockers statin decrease risk recurrent event death , recommend treatment patient heart attack , adherence recommendation associate well clinical outcome . However , numerous study show high dropout rate medical treatment . The cause nonadherence , common problem chronic disease , multifactorial ( economic , cultural , adverse effect ) , complexity treatment prescribe relevant factor cause non-compliance . The investigator goal ass whether simplification treatment secondary prevention once-daily capsule contain four drug increase adherence , compare standard treatment drug separately . The investigator design control , randomize , open , parallel-group clinical study . Patients randomize one follow treatment regimen : - Combined-Capsule : capsule contain adjust patient combination scheme secondary prevention daily . - Usual-treatment : component dish separately usual practice . The primary endpoint adherence treatment regimen secondary prevention . For study consider adherent patient take least 80 % medication belong period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-cap Increase Adherence After Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample Size Is estimate accord previous study adherence medical treatment 40 % , objective study demonstrate increase adherence 25 % absolute term ( 40 65 % ) simplifying treatment regimen . With parallel design , type I error 5 % , sample 200 patient would give study power 80 % detect difference . A study size would also give u increase 80 % power detect difference 14 mg / dl serum cholesterol ( estimate standard deviation 30 mg / dl ) alpha error rate 5 % ; 80 % power detect difference 4 mmHg systolic blood pressure ( standard deviation 10 mmHg ) , also type I error 5 % Procedures After sign write informed consent patient randomize 1:1 ratio , one study group : - Group 1 : Conventional treatment : daily tablet ramipril ( 5-10 mg / day ) , atenolol ( 50-100 mg / day ) , aspirin 100 mg / day simvastatin 40 mg / day . The dos drug may increase accord blood pressure heart rate patient follow-up visit . - Group 2 : one capsule contain ramipril ( 5 10 mg ) , atenolol ( 50 100 mg ) , 100 mg aspirin , 40 mg simvastatin . In follow-up visit dos atenolol ramipril capsule may adjust accord blood pressure heart rate . All medication patient receives determine adjusted dos determine treat physician . In patient receive 100 mg / day atenolol 10 mg / day ramipril require additional treatment control blood pressure recommend use thiazide diuretic , calcium channel blocker alpha-methyldopa , order . All medication patient receives determine adjusted dos determine treat physician . In patient receive 100 mg / day atenolol 10 mg / day ramipril require additional treatment control blood pressure recommend use thiazide diuretic , calcium channel blocker alpha-methyldopa , order . The first supply study medication hold discharge hospital . Patients refer follow-up 7 day ( additional 7 day ) , month , 3 month six month ( final visit ) . For visit 2 , 3 4 tolerate fifteen ( 15 ) day consider patient attend visit . Randomization After sign informed consent , patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive study treatment . Randomization carry list random number generate computer block diagram 4 6 . Was also scheme use stratify gender diabetes . The mapping do use consecutive seal opaque envelope . To minimize risk predict next treatment , envelop handle pharmacy staff . After sign informed consent inform pharmacy staff concern study , open appropriate envelope responsible preparation supply medication ( Appendix 1 ) . Data Anthropometric data , risk factor , cardiovascular history , blood pressure measurement basal heart rate collect . All patient lab test include blood count platelet count , fast blood glucose , creatinine , urea , electrolyte , liver function test , total cholesterol , cholesterol bound high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) low density ( LDL ) , triglyceride . Blood pressure pulse It measure left arm subject seat , 5 minute rest . Three blood pressure measurement separate minute average realize last two ( discard first value ) . Diastolic blood pressure record fifth Korotkoff sound . Heart rate measure average two measurement 30 second ; rhythm patient atrial fibrillation , two period 1 minute average . These measurement repeat follow-up visit . Electrocardiogram ECG perform baseline follow-up , subject supine position 5 minute rest . All make automatic ECG 12-lead equipment print analyze manually . Laboratory The baseline analysis perform admission coronary care unit ( routine practice ) , analysis consider basal level lipid ( total cholesterol fraction ) admission hospital rest determination , value day follow fasting . Laboratory analysis end study conduct patient 12 hour fast , stop study medication . Analyses perform hospital laboratory Crossing accord standard technique . Assessing platelet aggregation perform aggregometry evaluate turbidimetric method ( AggRAM , Helena Laboratories , Beaumont , Texas , USA ) . In track value blood pressure heart rate record visit , well pill count also conduct assess adherence . All data collect form design study store database . The data input system perform minimize duplicate entry error information . Follow Follow-up visit conduct interview one researcher . The monitoring scheme follow : - 7 day : additional 7 day . - At 30 day : additional 15 day . - At 3 month : additional 15 day . - At 6 month : additional 15 day ( final visit ) . Each visit interview , physical examination ECG . Counting capsule pill assess adherence perform new supply medication provide period next visit . At final visit , prior consultation researcher , blood 12 hour fast correspond laboratory evaluation perform . Study Medication Study medication prepare hospital pharmacy Crossing protocolized accord procedure . Losses follow Patients attend one follow-up visit exclude study analysis adhesion . In case , telephone contact attempt determine occurrence adverse event . Ethical Considerations Participants invite participate study explain detail objective . Be give copy write informed consent participation decide evacuate doubt protocol . The study conduct accord Declaration Helsinki , guideline international harmonization local law . In addition , protocol conduct accordance guideline good clinical practice . They brighten time patient voluntary nature participation study inform consent process . At visit ask verbally desire continue study . Statistical Analysis Qualitative variable describe use number percentage . Continuous variable describe use mean standard deviation median interquartile range , normal non-normal distribution , respectively . Normality determine evaluate quantile-quantile graphic Shapiro-Wilk test . Analyses perform accord intention-to-treat analysis patient accord group assign . The primary endpoint analysis perform Pearson chi2 test . Further estimate relative risk adhesion experimental treatment group compare control group , correspond confidence interval use 2 x 2 table . The difference group level cholesterol blood pressure make use Student 's test . Subgroup analyze accord age ( great less median ) , sex , education , diabetes , previous myocardial infarction angioplasty perform . All analyze perform two-tailed p value le 0.05 used indicate statistical significance .</detailed_description>
