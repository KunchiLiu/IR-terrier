	<brief_summary>A successful non-operative management strategy early appendicitis decrease number child require surgery may improve quality care relate treatment appendicitis . To account child-family perspective treatment preference , investigator perform study patient family choose antibiotic alone ( Non-operative group ) appendectomy ( Surgery group ) ten U.S. hospital . This study determine effectiveness non-operative management early appendicitis antibiotic alone child compare difference morbidity , disability , quality life , satisfaction , cost family choose surgery non-operative management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-institutional Trial Non-operative Management Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several randomize controlled trial compare appendectomy antibiotic alone adult acute appendicitis report non-U.S. country . These study reveal non-operative management appendicitis safe treatment appendicitis associate significantly low risk complication appendectomy . We recently complete first study U.S. examine feasibility non-operative management uncomplicated appendicitis child . In pilot study , patient family choose urgent appendectomy antibiotic alone treatment uncomplicated appendicitis . The success rate non-operative management 90 % 30 day 80 % median follow-up 8 month . In addition , patient non-operative group demonstrate significantly faster return normal activity report high quality life score . The current proposal seek investigate effectiveness non-operative management antibiotic alone treatment option child uncomplicated appendicitis . When randomized trial feasible due strong treatment preference small proportion patient accept randomization , parallel group non-randomized study participant allocate preferred treatment valuable alternative . Based feedback multi-disciplinary stakeholder group convene assess potential impact family preference study outcome , recruitment , generalizability , propose multi-institutional trial patient family choose antibiotic alone ( Non-operative group ) appendectomy ( Surgery group ) . We hypothesize non-operative management successful 75 % patient 1 year follow-up associate few disability day , high quality life score , low cost appendectomy . This study enroll 795 patient , age 8-17 year , uncomplicated appendicitis 10 child 's hospital . The primary outcome : 1 ) difference treatment-related disability non-operative management surgery child uncomplicated appendicitis across 10 child 's hospital ; 2 ) success rate non-operative management uncomplicated appendicitis 10 child 's hospital , define percent patient treat non-operatively undergo appendectomy . Secondary outcome include difference group rate complicate appendicitis , post-treatment related complication , disability day parent , quality life healthcare satisfaction measure , total cost incremental cost-effectiveness non-operative management relative appendectomy . The propose study expand upon previous pilot study include patient freestanding non-freestanding child 's hospital urban rural demography determine success rate morbidity associate non-operative management population well represent overall population child U.S . Successful completion study may provide evidence effectiveness non-operative management uncomplicated appendicitis alternative first line therapy child .</detailed_description>
