	<brief_summary>Central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSIs ) common healthcare-associated infection child associate morbidity mortality . This study attempt identify source bloodstream infection ( BSIs ) child CLABSI hypothesize many BSIs currently classify CLABSIs actually laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection ( LCBI ) may result mucosal barrier injury ( MBI ) , also know MBI-LCBI . In order study , isolate bacteria multiple body sit child BSI order compare bacteria strain grow blood use whole-genome DNA sequencing . We also evaluate biomarkers MBI respiratory tract GI tract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort pilot study Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) explore source presume CLABSI , believe may actually multiple possible source include MBI . We plan enroll inpatient child BCH meet Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) definition MBI-LCBI well child meet criterion CLABSI without MBI . For enrolled patient , collect sample oral cavity , respiratory tract , skin , stool . These sample culture order see microbial specie strain ( ) grow blood also grow site . Cultures isolated colony select whole-genome DNA sequence allow assessment genomic diversity body sit . Stool blood sample test marker MBI . All patient enrollment sample collection do BCH .</detailed_description>
