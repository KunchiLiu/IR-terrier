	<brief_summary>Purpose - The investigator aim evaluate feasibility remote interpretation ultrasound image use smartphone base realtime image transmission system . Methods A total 100 echocardiography examination ; 50 show ejection fraction 50 % remain 50 case show ejection fraction 50 % , 100 abdominal ultrasound image ; 50 sign acute appendicitis 50 finding appendicitis consecutively select . The 12 raters review original image use LCD monitor ultrasound machine also iPhone connect ultrasound machine via remote image transmission system ( CubeView , Alpinion medical system , Seoul , Korea ) , evaluate leave ventricular systolic function ( echocardiography ) measure ejection fraction grade probability presence acute appendicitis examination five Likert scale . The sensitivity specificity two device compare diagnostic performance two device also compare . The image quality two device measure use double stimulation impairment scale ( DSIS )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 12 raters randomly divide two group The raters group one review echocardiographies examination number one 50 use LCD monitor ultrasound machine review remain 50 examination number 51 100 use iPhone CubeView first visit The group firstly review echocardiography number one 50 use iPhone CubeView 51 100 LCD monitor . They visit twice interval four week review echocardiography examination use revered device session . They also review abdominal ultrasound image plan review echocardiography . When review echocardiography , raters measure ejection fraction visual estimation ( 1=obviously normal EF , 2 = probably normal EF , 3 = unsure , 4 = probably reduce EF , 5 = obviously reduce EF ) . In cate abdominal ultrasound , instructed rate likelihood presence absence appendicitis case use five-Likert scale ( 1 = obvious appendicitis , 2 = unlikely appendicitis , 3 = unsure , 4 = likely appendicitis , 5 = obvious appendicitis ) .</detailed_description>
