	<detailed_description>Vesicoureteral reflux ( VUR ) common urologic diagnosis neonate estimate 1 % newborn , 30-45 % child present urinary tract infection ( 1 ) . Optional treatment child VUR include conservative therapy without prophylactic antibiotic , endoscopic , laparoscopic , open surgery . The first endoscopic treatment present 1981 Matouschek , inject Teflon submucosa ureteral orifice , six ` clock position ( STING ) . In technique , inject needle insert work channel cystoscope . The procedure relatively short perform out-patient surgery . In 2000 , Dextranomer/Hyaluronic acid ( DefluxR ) approve FDA , subsequently become treatment choice VUR grade 2-4 . In 2004 , hydrodistention-implantation technique ( HIT ) introduce Kirsch . HIT involve use pressurize stream fluid direct ureter aid visualization , injection submucosa within ureteric tunnel improve coaptation ureter ( 3 ) . A review Deflux therapy VUR 63 study , include 8101 ureter , find success rate 51 % -79 % depend VUR grade . ( grade 1,2 79 % , grade 3 72 % , grade 4 63 % , grade 5 51 % ) ( 2 ) . One disadvantage attribute Deflux loss 20 % inject material time ( result absorption hyaluronic acid ) , may explain low success rate endoscopic treatment VUR compare open surgery . In 2005 , Polyacrylate Polyalcohol ( VantrisR ) , non- absorbable chemical preparation introduce endoscopic treatment VUR , aim improve result Deflux prevent volume loss . Preliminary result three year follow-up use Vantris show high level reflux resolution ( 4 ) . The aim current study compare rate resolution VUR use Deflux versus Vantris bilateral VUR</detailed_description>
