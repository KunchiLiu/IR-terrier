	<brief_title>Identification Polymorphisms Involved Metabolism Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol inside outside operating room anesthesia drug widely use . In term efficacy side effect profile propofol know property insufficient data metabolism . Propofol typically undergo biotransformation microsomal enzyme liver . For administered dose , take place glucuronidation UGT1A9 enzyme , remain portion oxidize CYP2B6 hydroxylation reaction . However , enzyme involve metabolism propofol enzymes highly polymorphic . Polymorphisms occur enzymes ; effect propofol , side effect drug need show individual difference term cause . Determination genetic background individual personal anesthetic regimen improve . Thus , useful person drug resistance , increase incidence side effect reduce . In particular , aware mutation , propofol infusion syndrome mortal side effect prevent . The main purpose study , individual difference think cause polymorphic variation UGT1A9 CYP2B6 gene determine . Especially UGT1A9 gene mutation may associate ethnic structure observe . In Caucasian , African-American community polymorphisms gene show Japanese . So result genetic structure society consider . Therefore , study aim determine genetic polymorphism Turkish society has.Physiological factor age sex person different answer cause propofol . Another object study identification factor lead different answer present relationship polymorphism .</detailed_description>
