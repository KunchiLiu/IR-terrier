	<brief_summary>Significant morbidity , mortality , related cost cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . A simple , effective , lightweight device worn athletes war fighter field , design mitigate TBI result blast trauma concussive event , would save life , huge cost currently experience life-treatment surviving victim . An externally-worn medical device applies mild jugular compression accord principle Queckenstedt Maneuver ( Device ) develop Q30 Labs , LLC ( Q30 ) . Initial research suggest Device potential reduce likelihood TBI . The currently develop collar ( Smith 2009 ; Smith 2011 ; Smith 2011 ; Smith 2012 ) approve study human result indicate safety use high demand maximal exertion activity , Study ID : 2013-2240 , Institutional Review Board - Federalwide Assurance # 00002988 ) . Regarding safety , externally worn collar meticulously design mimic body 's omohyoid muscle action upon jugular vein provide similar pressure volume increase surpass yawn mere act lie . This study investigate effectiveness device high school athlete play collision contact sport football , hockey , lacrosse . The high risk sport utilize helmet competition allow measurement system embed headgear affect play fit equipment . Athletes participate study enrol one two group 1 ) device wear 2 ) non-device wear . By nature sport select , likely pilot study primarily include male , however female meet inclusion criterion team select include pilot investigation . The helmet participant outfit accelerometer measure magnitude every impact head sustain athlete . Effectiveness device determine brain image pre-season , midseason , end season time point . A subset athlete report diagnose concussion also receive additional brain imaging within week follow diagnosed concussive event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Device promise provide novel mechanism reduce prevent likelihood TBI , may use conjunction protective equipment . TBI lead cause death individual age 45 . The cost TBI U.S. estimate anywhere $ 50 $ 150 billion , annually . The January , 2008 New England Journal Medicine report , `` Head neck injury , include severe brain trauma , report one quarter service member evacuate Iraq Afghanistan '' ( Okie 2005 ; Xydakis 2005 ; Hoge 2008 ) . The vast majority injury result exposure improvise explosive device ( IED ) blast wave . Head injury , concussion result trauma public discussion recently National Football League ( NFL ) deal lawsuit regard head injury one-third live former NFL player also concern athlete participate wide range sport , include hockey , rugby soccer . According NASA , `` The oscillation fluid cause external force , call sloshing , occur move vehicle contain liquid mass , truck , etc . '' This oscillation occur vessel partially fill . Similarly , brain face slosh peril external force impartation . Slosh permit external energy absorb content partially fill vessel container mean inelastic collision . Tissues differ density decelerate different rate create shear cavitation . If collision object molecule elastic , transfer energy object diminishes , minimize energy impart slosh . Woodpeckers , head ram sheep mammal ( include mankind ) small , little know misunderstood muscle neck call omohyoid muscle . Highly G-tolerant creature forest utilized muscle gently restrict outflow internal jugular vein thereby `` take '' excess compliance cranial space ultimately protect TBI like tiny `` airbags '' motor vehicle . Rat study Smith et al . demonstrated investigator easily safely facilitate muscle 's action well-engineered gentle compression muscle . The medical Queckenstedt Maneuver devise detect spinal cord compression , gently place pressure external jugular vein increase cerebral spinal volume pressure . In maneuver , vein compress lumber puncture monitor intracranial pressure . `` Normally , pressure rise high 'plateau ' level occur instantly upon jugular compression fall equally fast upon release compression '' ( Gilland 1969 ) . This incredibly simple principle employ protect soldier athletes TBI safely , reversibly , increase intracranial volume pressure . The neck collar device make hytrel ( plastic ) , silicone , metal fabric fit neck provide comfortable precise jugular compression potentially mitigate cerebral slosh ( Figure 1 ) . Although skull , blood , brain `` almost incompressible , '' vasculature tree cerebrum quite reactive compressible . As volume add cranium , eventually compensatory reserve volume surpass intracranial pressure increase slightly . Increasing cerebral blood volume 1-3 % safely reversibly reduce compliance cerebral vascular tree diminishes absorption slosh energy . Jugular compression increase cerebral blood volume almost instantaneously . As mention , degree increase significantly mitigate slosh TBI laboratory animal mimic highly concussion resistant wild animal able reflexively increase cerebral blood volume jugular compression . A landmark article , publish Journal Neurosurgery , use standard acceleration-deceleration impact laboratory model mild TBI . The study show successful marked reduction axonal injury follow Internal Jugular Vein ( IJV ) compression indicate immunohistochemical staining Amyloid Precursor Proteins ( APP ) ( Smith 2012 ; Turner 2012 ) . It argue IJV compression reduces slosh-mediated brain injury increase intracranial blood volume reduce compliance potential brain movement within confines skull . The potential technique mitigate linear rotational brain injury human `` internal protection '' represent novel approach mitigate TBI . Summary Prior Work A . Safety test athlete approve local IRB complete Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Human Performance Laboratory ( Study ID : 2013-2240 ; PI : Gregory Myer ) . Evaluation monitor vital sign , biomechanics , cardiorespiratory capacity , postural control , dynamic stabilization , reactive index , concentration cognition , memory , strength power population athlete show statistically significant adverse effect wear mild jugular vein compressive neck collar compare sham arm band . ( Myer 2013 ) Cumulatively , pre post safety measure indicate neurologic parameter executive function , eye hand coordination , balance , memory reaction time unchanged follow two hour physical test wear collar prototype . Acceptance compression collar different physiological biomarker response non-collared condition maximal oxygen uptake maximum effort power test . ( Myer 2013 ) B . Magnetic Resonance Elastography establish CCHMC collaboration The Mayo Clinic support study . Under jugular vein compression collar , subject tolerate procedure without untoward effect . The preliminary study dynamic shear strain show consistent pattern wave propagation elasticity , place upon vascular cranial tissue . Analysis data continue . C. Four hundred ten ( 410 ) subject ( age 12 68 year age ) study MEPA ( middle ear power analysis ) without compression collar complaint untoward effect note decline auditory perception record . The expected change reduce Acoustic Reflectance inner ear middle ear ( indicative reduce compliance ) note subgroup analysis jugular vein compression . The result study indicate neck compression collar prototype may potential safely reduce energy impartation cranial structure ( i.e . inner ear ) , however work need advanced collar design establish effect . D. fMRI CO2 reactivity perform twelve adult application jugular vein compression . Results compare jugular vein compression ( collar ) yield alteration O2 uptake glucose metabolism portion brain .
