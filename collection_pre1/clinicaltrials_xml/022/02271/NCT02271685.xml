	<brief_summary>Participants assign complete computerized estimation task component accuracy , estimate duration sound . Participants tell task use early diagnostic tool detect risk medical condition ( e.g. , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease ) . Instructions give participant tell accuracy task associate disease , whereas risk disease tend either overestimate underestimate duration sound . The investigator examine whether instruction purpose diagnosticity task bias participant ' response task , lead purposefully inaccurate estimate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sound Estimation Accuracy Task</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants assign complete computerized task component accuracy , estimate length , time , sound . Participants tell task use early diagnostic tool detect risk medical condition ( e.g. , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease ) . Instructions give participant tell accuracy task associate disease question , whereas risk disease tend either overestimate underestimate duration sound . The investigator examine whether instruction purpose diagnosticity task bias participant ' response task . The investigator collect additional survey measure statistical control potential explanatory variable variation performance task , also test whether financial incentive accuracy task improve accuracy response task . Following task , participant tell task use actually NOT diagnostic disease question , deception use learn people respond instruction task use diagnostic purpose .</detailed_description>
