	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) prevalent chronic condition gradually lead three dimensional deformity spine . Spine curvature increase youths puberty progress . Generally , observation suggest adolescent early scoliosis ( Cobb 's angle ≤ 20° ) . Rigid brace treatment draconian due high corrective force nearly constrain movement . Flexible brace treatment alternative option ; however , efficacy still controversial . Functional intimate apparel specialize design teenager scoliosis limit part provide improvement bad posture , hunchback . A scientific approach use design develop functional intimate apparel treatment option adolescent early scoliosis . This project aim combine clinical experience textile material science research develop functional intimate apparel adolescent early scoliosis . As result , reduce future likelihood brace wear surgery . In study , eligible subject give tailor-made functional intimate apparel wear 8 hour daily . Monitoring observation provide 12-18 month wear period . The effectiveness functional intimate apparel evaluate pre- post- treatment X-ray radiography .</brief_summary>
