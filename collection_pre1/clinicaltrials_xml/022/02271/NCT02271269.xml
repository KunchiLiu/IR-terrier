	<detailed_description>By reduce intraocular pressure , glaucoma topical eye medication effective control disease progression majority patient . Yet evidence show many glaucoma patient incomplete adherence medication , result significant personal cost term disease progression visual field loss . The cost health system poor adherence also substantial glaucoma surgery costly treatment topical medication . Behavioural economics theory suggest adherence rate improve providing clearer link non-adherence resulting cost thereof . In proposed study , link make grant subsidy adherent patient medication physician visit , whereas sufficiently adherent would receive subsidy thus pay high rate treatment . These subsidy provide financial incentive patient take medicine prescribe , prescription refill visit occur regularly , also provide tangible near-term cost result non-adherence . The investigator refer approach value pricing subsidy allocate medication show clinically effective also effectively use patient . In effort increase adherence among glaucoma patient Singapore , investigator propose conduct 6-month proof-of-concept randomize controlled trial among 100 participant Singapore National Eye Centre ( SNEC ) test extent value pricing improve medication adherence . As Singapore 's population continue age large share population require daily medication treat chronic disease , innovative solution need ensure patient take medication prescribe receive full benefit treatment also Government subsidy allocate effectively ensure sustainability health system . Specific Aim hypothesis test : Aim : Test whether add Value Pricing ( VP ) Usual Care ( UC ) improve medication adherence 6-month period . Hypothesis : VP patient show great adherence rate 6 month compare receive UC .</detailed_description>
