	<brief_title>Treating Diabetic Lipohypertrophy With Intensive Education Versus Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This interventional clinical trial Ealing Hospital ( UK ) patient DM1 DM2 treat insulin least 1 year , age 18 75 year inclusive , goal 95 patient randomize 'LH+ Intervention ' arm 95 patient randomize 'LH+ Standard Care ' arm . LH+ refers presence clinically-confirmed LH little doubt presence . The study take place 4 clinic visit , form part usual clinical visit ( space 3-month interval Ealing ) . Each visit describe . INTERVENTION The intervention consist instruct patient LH detect currently inject move injection non-LH area ; reduce insulin dos initially 10-20 % avoid hypoglycaemia titrate target control ; instruct patient correctly rotate site ( leave 1 cm injection puncture allow use site heal 2-4 week inject ) ; instruct patient forego needle reuse ; instruct patient switch 4 mmx32G needle . A battery tool ( describe ) use deliver reinforce training , include frequent contact phone electronic mean initial training . CONTROL Standard care mean afford patient randomize control arm customary education follow-up usually give centre . This would include appraise presence LH ( previously aware ) state injection give area . The training approach , tool intensive follow-up give Intervention arm patient give Controls . Additionally , return visit ( 3 6 month ) , Control patient ask indeed change injection habit ( e.g . stop inject LH ) since enter study . Those analysed separately see difference outcome group compare Intervention arm patient .</detailed_description>
