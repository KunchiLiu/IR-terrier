	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b/2 open-label study evaluate safety/efficacy MEDI-551 + MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) participant relapse refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma fail 1-2 prior line therapy . The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) high protocol-defined dose ( HPDD ) ; absence exceed MTD MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) ; evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy MEDI-551 Combination With Immunomodulating Therapies Subjects With Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MEDI-551 IgG1k antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) enhance anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) . MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) humanize IgG4κ mAb program death-1 ( PD-1 ) , block inhibitory PD-1 receptor ( PD-L1 ) T cell augment immune response . This study explore novel combination regimen patient multiply relapsed refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma limit opportunity cure , may offer regimen less toxicity equal good efficacy versus traditional chemotherapy . The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) high protocol-defined dose ( HPDD ; absence exceed MTD ) MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) ; evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) . Secondary objective : evaluate pharmacokinetics antidrug antibody MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) patient multiply relapsed refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma . Exploratory objectives determine impact tumor program death-1 ligand ( PD-L1 ) expression clinical activity combination treatment follow soluble PD-1 PD-L1 expression biomarkers activity . This study determine MTD HPDD , safety , activity MEDI-551 combination MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) patient multiply relapsed refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma fail 1-2 prior line therapy . Using standard 3+3 design , 3 6 participant relapse refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma enrol per cohort dose-escalation portion determine MTD combination MEDI-551 MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) . A maximum 18 participant enrolled escalation portion study . Patients receive MEDI-551 12 mg/kg monthly 1 3 possible dos MEDI0680 ( AMP-514 ) administer bimonthly 1 year . If patient experience progressive disease complete first year therapy , combination treatment may resume 12 additional month . After MTD identification , additional patient enrol dose expansion portion ensure total sample size 26 efficacy-evaluable patient . Participants dose expansion portion adult confirm aggressive B-cell DLBCL . Thirteen 26 efficacy-evaluable patient receive MTD require PD-L1 expression . Patients stratify refractoriness chemotherapy , CD20 therapy PD-L1 status . Results inform additional study find chemotherapy-free regimen frail participant multiply relapsed refractory Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas .</detailed_description>
