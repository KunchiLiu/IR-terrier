	<brief_summary>The rationale perioperative red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion base observation anemia independent risk factor morbidity mortality cardiac operation . However , transfusion associate high rate morbidity mortality critically ill patient , recent study show bad outcome , include increase occurrence renal failure infection , well respiratory , cardiac , neurological complication , transfuse compare non transfuse patient cardiac surgery . On basis past clinical observation , author suggest hematocrit maintain around 30 % hemoglobin concentration 10 g/dL . Recently , however , hemoglobin threshold reconsider recognize risk associate transfusion great appreciation importance individual physiological response anemia . In comparative trial 428 patient undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , Bracey et al report reduce hemoglobin trigger 8 g/dL adversely affect patient outcomes result low cost . An important multicenter Canadian Study Hebert et al include large number critically ill patient reveal A restrictive strategy red-cell transfusion ( hemoglobin concentration maintain 7.0and 9.0g/dL ) least effective possibly superior liberal transfusion ( hemoglobin concentration 10 12 g/dL ) strategy critically ill patient , possible exception patient acute myocardial infarction unstable angina , term reduce organ dysfunction mortality . The investigator would like determine whether restrictive strategy red-cell transfusion liberal strategy produce equivalent result orthopedic-oncology patient undergoing surgery .</brief_summary>
