	<brief_summary>Skin cancer common cancer Caucasians , basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common skin cancer around 44,000 new tumour per year , incidence still rise . In past disease elderly patient consequence recreational sun exposure tan bed , young patient develop skin cancer well . There different subtypes BCC subtypes treat surgical excision . Nowadays , non-invasive technique photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) common practice treat superficial BCC ( sBCC ) . Because technique treatment surgical excision avoid possibility complication scar formation . Both 5-aminolevulino acid ( 5-ALA ) lipophilic methyl aminolevulinate ( MAL ) use precursor photosensitiser . These agent generate excess protoporphyrin IX metabolic active cell , illuminate specific light source lead release reactive oxygen radical tissue . The result apoptosis necrosis tumour cell . At moment , two treatment protocol use Netherlands : fractionate 5-ALA 20 % ( Fagron ) protocol accord de Haas MAL ( Metvix , Galderma ) protocol . Because MAL first market registered treatment option premalignant superficial malignancy hospital Netherlands use topical agent . However , evidence 2 agent ( cost- ) effective and/ prefer patient . Objective : determine treatment effective treatment term prevention treatment failure , cost saving patient preference compare fractionate 5-ALA 20 % PDT versus MAL PDT 2 treatment session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma Treatment With Topical Photodynamic Therapy With Fractionated 5-aminolevulinic Acid 20 % Versus Two Stage Methylaminolevulinate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Basal cell carcinoma throughout world Skin cancer common form cancer , basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common form skin cancer , incidence still rising.1,2 Of type BCC , superficial basal cell carcinoma ( sBCC ) , histopathologic subtype fast grow incidence , especially trunk young patients.3-5 It common health problem although chance metastasis lead aggressive form BCC ability cause serious local destruction . - Treatment option The DBC ( diagnose behandel combinatie ) cost price , amount receive diagnostic treatment one BCC , surgical excision partly free negotiable hospital health insurance . Only DBC cost price patient whose health insurance contract hospital public everyone . This lead around 18 million euro ( base cost price 400.00 euro 44,000 new BCCs per year ) yearly spent surgical treatment BCC Netherlands cost increase future grow incidence.6 For BCC subtypes effective treatment surgery sBCC non-invasive treatment like photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) suitable . It well accept today 's dermatologic practice surgical excision consider over-treatment sBCC.7-9 PDT superior surgical excision primary sBCC size low-risk sites.9 As consequence unnecessary anaesthesia incision avoid thereby prevent side-effects , scar , haematomas functional disruption , healthy tissue preserve . MAL worldwide register agent use topical PDT sBCC 5-ALA registered European Union . In Netherlands fractionate 5-ALA 20 % MAL PDT 2 session use treatment sBCC . Although study show effectiveness treatment regimen , effectiveness , cost patient preference never study prospective randomise trial . - Developments treatment : photodynamic therapy PDT become increasingly implemented standard care sBCC last years.8-10 Nowadays , Maastricht University Medical Centre , 60 % patient treat PDT . Similar situation find Erasmus MC Rotterdam VieCuri Medical Centre Venlo/Venray . On national level , around two third patient treat MAL PDT 2 session one third fractionate 5-ALA 20 % PDT . This distribution historically determine base evidence base research . - 5-ALA 20 % PDT versus MAL PDT There randomise controlled study treatment common skin cancer.11 Choice PDT treatment fractionate 5-ALA 20 % MAL 2 session often depend experience choice physician availability precursor hospital . World-wide , study perform MAL accept standard care PDT.12 However , accord literature , effectiveness term clearance rate different study low MAL two session compare fractionate 5-ALA 20 % PDT : 79 % versus 97 % intention treat ( ITT ) one year sBCC.13,14 Contra dictionary , MAL theoretical benefit faster absorb cell 5-ALA 20 % , thereby , generate high production protoporphyrin IX . In addition MAL high selectivity tumour cell , induce few side-effects normal tissue . 15,16 This discrepancy theoretical work mechanism clearance rate need clinical research effectiveness treatment . PDT hospital administer treatment modality patient come hospital one day ( fractionate 5-ALA 20 % ) two day one week apart ( MAL 2 session ) . Patient compliance could higher fractionate 5-ALA 20 % MAL 2 session patient visit hospital second time . At part body patient experience variable burning pain sensation PDT might influence complete treatment . Kuijpers et al . find significant difference pain score ALA-PDT 2 session MAL PDT 2 sessions.17 We expect 5-ALA 20 % PDT side-effects study patient treat twice day . Furthermore important take consideration difference patient acceptability cost ( see 'economic evaluation ' ) .18 A well-designed study compare two topical PDT treatment modality : fractionate 5-ALA 20 % MAL 2 session provide answer need establish position two modality treatment patient sBCC . The conclusion propose study serve basis update guideline treatment sBCC catch recent development clinical practice .</detailed_description>
