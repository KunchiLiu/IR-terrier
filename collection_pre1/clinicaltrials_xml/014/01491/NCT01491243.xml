	<brief_title>N-GAL Allows Intensive Treatment Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography receive preventive treatment contrast induce nephropathy . An acute kidney injury generally detect late allow effective intervention patient undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) new biomarker predictive AKI already show useful early diagnosis contrast induce nephropathy . Purpose The primary objective study test hypothesis NGAL-driven early intensive strategy reduce occurrence contrast induce nephropathy patient urgent/emergency coronary angiography</detailed_description>
