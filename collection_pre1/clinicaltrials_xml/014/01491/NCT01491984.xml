	<detailed_description>A laryngoscope medical instrument use get view voice box space vocal cord . A laryngoscope use place breathe tube trachea ( windpipe airway ) protect patient 's airway provide way help person breathe surgery ; call intubation . The placement breathe tube windpipe skill easily master . In fact , placement difficult impossible use usual technique 1-3 every 100 patient . The ease place breathe tube depend part easily much vocal cord able see directly use laryngoscope . In small number patient , Levitan First Pass Success ( FPS ) Scope show effective easy insert even patient difficult airway . This study evaluate use LFS compare conventional laryngoscope subject simulate difficult airway . The goal study determine effectiveness safety LFS large number patient simulate airway difficulty . The result obtain study may provide useful information health care provider place breathe tube patient either operate room emergency situation require intubation paramedic . An example would trauma situation paramedic difficulty attempt intubation patient c-spine protected movement . The LFS affordable transportable device , make attractive asset health provider small community setting paramedic vehicle may capacity stock ability afford variety different scope must choose limited selection .</detailed_description>
