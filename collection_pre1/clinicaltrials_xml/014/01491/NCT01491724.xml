	<brief_title>The Learning Curve Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) Images Interpretation Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia ( GIM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Gastric cancer remain second lead cause cancer relate death world . The incidence mortality rate predominant East Asia [ 1 ] . Usually , gastric cancer asymptomatic early stage ; therefore , patient advance stage incurable diagnosis . The pathogenesis intestinal type gastric cancer sequential multistep pathway . Gastric intestinal metaplasia ( GIM ) precancerous lesion intestinal type gastric cancer [ 2 ] . The strategy detect precancerous and/or early cancerous transformation beneficial early gastric cancer potentially cure endoscopic treatment . Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscope pCLE useful GIM detection 94 % sensitivity [ 3 ] . However , perfect sensitivity pCLE interpretation provide expertise . We still know expert GIM interpretation . No study learn curve GIM interpretation pCLE publish Observation Measurement : Collect accuracy GIM interpretation pCLE report ROC curve Methodology : 1 . Six inexperienced pCLE reader recruit . 2 . All inexperienced pCLE reader must attend learn session . 3 . Self-review CD recommend inexperienced pCLE reader 4 . Two-week interval examination GIM interpretation 20 new histology-proved pCLE image ( GIM normal mucosa ) 5 session schedule train session . 5 . All Inexperienced pCLE reader need review train CD least day examination . 6 . The accuracy rate examination record individually inexperienced pCLE reader . 7 . ROC curve report learning curve GIM interpretation pCLE image . Data collection : All data process recorded one physician .</detailed_description>
