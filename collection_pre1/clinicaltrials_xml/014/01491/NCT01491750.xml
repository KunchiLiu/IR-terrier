	<brief_title>Guided Imagery Response Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study use mixed-method design ( quantitative experimental pilot study qualitative descriptive multiple case study method ) address study aim : AIM 1 : Generate estimate effect size assess feasibility procedure future RCT test model standardize , prerecord guide imagery intervention functional outcome TKR . AIM 2 : Elucidate GI responder mechanism analysis effect image ability potential moderator guide imagery 's effect TKR outcomes . AIM 3 : Analyze effect guide imagery outcome expectancy , psychological distress , rehabilitation commitment neuroimmune activation mediator TKR functional outcome . AIM 4 : Identify patient ' perspective related receiving , participate study , guide imagery intervention total knee replacement surgery ( TKR ) . DESIGN The propose study modify sequential explanatory mixed method design consist Phase I RCT combine Phase II qualitative descriptive case study . Mixed-methods research ideal strategy rigorous development intervention GI clinical testing . By systematically combine quantitative qualitative approach , method uniquely able produce information evaluate intervention 's context , interaction participant characteristic , link intervention outcome . A variety mixed method design develop , different emphasis ( denote UPPER CASE LETTERS ) , sequence ( denoted order listing ) , qualitative ( qual ) quantitative ( quan ) approach . The sequential explanatory design ( QUAN/qual ) , primarily quantitatively orient , use qualitative method describe explain within- between-subject variation quantitative outcome experimental study . After initial quantitative ( QUAN ) data collection analysis , criterion sample use identify average extreme case value quantitative outcome variable treatment group . Qualitative ( qual ) data collection analysis case provide additional information application , operation , outcome intervention beyond statistical finding , test validity conceptual link intervention outcome . Qualitative method permit full exploration subjective process evolve major health care experience uncover complex dynamic nature process , particularly suit gain description insight regard response alternative therapy . The sequential explanatory method thus well-suited study effect CAM intervention . The mixed method design also help clarify participant ' view actual nature intervention , include burden treatment , reveal unanticipated situational constraint enhancement execution . METHODS In accord sequential explanatory design , project involve three phase : Phase I ( QUAN ) : Quantitative data collection analysis ; Phase II ( qual ) : Qualitative inquiry amplify quantitative finding ; Phase III : Final integration finding address study aim inform development subsequent RCT .</detailed_description>
