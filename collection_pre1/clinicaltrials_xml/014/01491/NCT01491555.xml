	<brief_summary>Researchers Children 's Hospital Boston Neurology Department invite child participate new research study . Researchers look boy age 2 - 30 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) healthy boy age 2 - 30 ( without nerve muscle concern ) serve control . The study evaluate new technique test nerve muscle function . The test pain free . Children participate study come 10 visit two year . Visits take place every month first , less often remain visit . The test study take approximately 2hours . If participant interested would like learn study , please call Lavanya Madabusi 617-919-3554 Lavanya.Madabusi @ childrens.harvard.edu .

	<brief_title>Electrical Impedance Myography Ultrasound Biomarkers Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Characterized progressive disability lead death , Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) remain one common devastate neuromuscular disorder childhood . Although variety promise new treatment strategy development , outcome measure clinical trial remain limited part set functional measure , six-minute walk test . While clearly useful , measure impact unrelated factor , mood effort , limited repeatability . To address limitation , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) investigate surrogate measure . However , easily apply , cost-effective , office-based surrogate measure provide high repeatability sensitivity still correlate strongly disease status would find wider use Phase II possibly Phase III clinical trial DMD . Quantitative ultrasound ( QUS ) electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) two technique could serve role . In QUS , muscle pathology ( fibrosis fatty infiltration ) DMD result increase energy reflect back ( backscatter ) ultrasound . The amount backscatter measure directly analyze raw frequency-based acoustic data indirectly control process gray-scale image . EIM , contrast , rely upon application localize electrical current measurement result surface voltage , similarly impact fibrotic change develop muscle disease progress . Here , investigator propose evaluate compare methodology simultaneously group DMD patient normal subject order ass ability identify clinically meaningful alteration muscle health short interval time . As final exploratory analysis , investigator also study possibility combine two modality . The result work broad application could apply variety neuromuscular condition , include muscular dystrophy . Thus , hypothesis proposal QUS EIM serve convenient , non-invasive , clinically meaningful surrogate marker disease progression DMD surpass functional measure currently use .</detailed_description>
