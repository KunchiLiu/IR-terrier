	<brief_summary>Dasatinib drug show stop cancer cell grow . This drug use treatment type cancer information research study suggest dasatinib may help stop squamous cell lung cancer grow , especially individual whose tumor mutation DDR2 gene . Advanced squamous cell lung cancer ( SqCC ) carry poor prognosis new therapeutic target need . Several study examine dasatinib NSCLC ; report significant toxicity , also responses patient find harbor mutation DDR2 BRAF . An open-label phase II trial dasatinib carry determine response rate patient SqCC previously fail standard chemotherapy correlate response patient genotype .</brief_summary>
