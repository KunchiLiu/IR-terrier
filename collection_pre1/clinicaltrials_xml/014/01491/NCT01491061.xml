	<brief_summary>It previously show pretreatment ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily 7 day significantly reduce procedural myocardial injury elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The investigator test hypothesis twice overnight high-dose ranolazine load PCI reduce peri-procedural myocardial ischemic damage similarly long-term pre-treatment standard dos .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Ranolazine novel antianginal drug reduces intracellular sodium calcium accumulation ischemia thus limit ischemic injury . It previously show pretreatment ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily 7 day significantly reduce procedural myocardial injury elective percutaneous coronary intervention . It remain unknown , however , two therapeutic approach effective PCI . Purpose The primary objective study test hypothesis twice overnight high-dose ranolazine load PCI reduce peri-procedural myocardial ischemic damage similarly long-term pre-treatment standard dos .</detailed_description>
