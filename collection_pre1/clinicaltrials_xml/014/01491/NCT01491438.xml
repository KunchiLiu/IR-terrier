	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : Main objective : To evaluate effectiveness plasma rich growth factor ( PRGF ) treatment patient venous ulcer . Secondary objective : To evaluate safety plasma rich growth factor treat patient venous ulcer . DESIGN : Randomized , open clinical trial parallel group , control conventional treatment . SAMPLE : Over age patient , primary care center Vitoria , least one venous ulcer 6 week evolution 0.5-6 cm diameter . INTERVENTION : 1-Experimental group : Autologous PRGF administrate week ( day 1 ) + conventional treatment administrate twice week ( day 1 4 ) 12 week treatment , case complete heal period , patient continue management protocol get . 2-Control group : Conventional treatment twice week ( day 1 4 ) 12 week treatment . Conventional treatment include : Cleaning debridement wound , application correspond dressing , use antibiotic necessary visit . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : The primary outcome analysis do logistic regression . The crude model adjust model ( confound variable ) build . The healing time ulcer ( day ) analyze use Kaplan Meier survival analysis correspond comparison use log rank test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open , randomize , parallel group , control clinical trial . Patients allocate first come one two treatment group use block random sequence generate computer remain hidden researcher patient allocation . Experimental group : PRGF together correspond dress accord annex IV . Control group : Corresponding dress accord annex IV . Both group submit cleaning , debridement , occlusive dressing use antibiotic necessary visit . After sign consent form , previously randomization , patient submit blood extraction determinate : Albumine ( g/dl ) , Hemoglobin ( g/dl ) , Hematocrit ( % ) , Creatinine ( mg/dl ) . If patient data collect previous analysis perform 30 day , necessary new extraction . Patients also submit initial valuation : - medical antecedent : history chronic venous insufficiency , previous medical treatment . - general state : dependence grade Barthel index , mobility , ankle arm index . - ulcer characteristic : exudate , sing location ulcer , antiquity ulcer , tunnel , infection , pain Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . - Anthropometric characteristic ; Weight , height Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . Patients go physician 's consult every four day ( Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday ) . When one ulcer close , patient go physician 's consult confirm remain closed seven fifteen day . In intervention control group , bad evolution ulcer deterioration least four consecutive week , obligate ask prefer inter-consultation Vascular Surgery Service . In visit follow variable measure : - Wound surface ( cm2 ) measure PUSH scale ( Pressure Ulcer Scale Healing ) belong GNEAUPP group ( National Group study advice pressure ulcer chronic wound ) . This variable measured visit . - Safety variable : Pruritus ( Yes/No ) , Pain ( VAS scale ) , Sings infection ( Yes/No ) . If patient experience one adverse effect accord judgment nurse precludes continuation study , nurse communicate physician discharge study necessary . All collect Case Report Form ( CRF ) .</detailed_description>
