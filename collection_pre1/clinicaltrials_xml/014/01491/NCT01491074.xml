	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) still associate high morbidity mortality , despite several improvement management . This may indicate important pathogenic mechanism contribute stable unstable atherosclerotic disease mechanism . Based upon previous research , investigator believe provide block damage inflammatory loop though short term inhibition Interleukin-6 receptor signalling , could attractive therapeutic target ACS ; particular interest patient non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , disease often characterize widespread coronary inflammation multiple unstable plaque . The investigator hypothesize single administration anti-Interleukin 6 receptor antagonist Tocilizumab , patient NSTEMI , may interrupt self-perpetuating inflammatory loop could improve plaque stability , potential secondary beneficial effect myocardial damage . This investigated randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled study , include total 120 patient .</brief_summary>
