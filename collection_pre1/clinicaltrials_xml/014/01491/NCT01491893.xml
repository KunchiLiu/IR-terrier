	<brief_summary>Purpose Study : To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) Phase II dose PVSRIPO deliver intracerebrally convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) . To obtain correlative mechanistic evidence PVSRIPO 's effect infect WHO Grade IV malignant glioma tumor estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patient . To obtain information clinical response rate intratumoral inoculation PVSRIPO . To estimate efficacy PVSRIPO administer optimal dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PVSRIPO genetically recombinant , non-pathogenic poliovirus : rhinovirus chimera tumor-specific conditional replication phenotype . It consist genome live attenuate poliovirus serotype 1 ( SABIN ) vaccine ( PV1S ) cognate internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) element replace human rhinovirus type 2 ( HRV2 ) . PVSRIPO manufacture NCI-Frederick , NCI , NIH . Catheter Implantation : PVSRIPO deliver directly tumor . A stereotactic biopsy perform prior virus administration frozen section confirmation viable tumor analysis . The biopsy needle place stereotactic guidance Cosman-Robert-Wells , MRI-compatible , stereotactic head frame similar frameless device . Immediately follow stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy , catheter implant operating room ( OR ) site different use biopsy use sterile technique . A CT may use confirm catheter placement post-operatively . Agent infusion : The entire volume agent deliver pre-loaded syringe investigational pharmacist connect catheter sterile condition Neuro-Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( NSICU ) neuro step unit prior begin infusion . Drug infusion occur NSICU neuro step unit emergency facility available . Patients infused Medfusion 3500 3010 infusion pump pre-programmed delivery rate 0.5 ml/hr . The total amount inoculum deliver patient 3 ml . The virus injection procedure complete within 6.5 hr . The catheter remove follow post-PVSRIPO infusion MRI . Biopsy sample analysis : Biopsy material obtain tumor tissue prior virus administration . This tissue material subject routine histology confirm tumor recurrence study neuropathologist , Dr. R. McLendon designate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Disease Status . Patients must recurrent supratentorial WHO Grade IV malignant glioma base image study measurable disease ( ≥ 1 cm ≤ 5.5 cm contrastenhancing tumor ) . Prior histopathology consistent World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade IV malignant glioma confirm study pathologist , Roger McLendon , designate . 2 . Age . Due potential implication treatment develop CNS , patient must ≥ 18 year age time entry study . 3 . Performance Status . The patient must Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % time entry . 4 . Laboratory Studies Platelet count ≥ 125,000/microliter prior biopsy . Platelets ≥ 100,000/microliter prior infusion Prothrombin Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior biopsy Positive serum antipoliovirus titer prior biopsy Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal prior biopsy Total bilirubin , SGOT , SGPT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x normal prior biopsy Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior biopsy Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior biopsy 5 . Poliovirus Immunization Booster . The subject must receive boost immunization trivalent inactivate IPOL™ ( SanofiPasteur ) least 1 week prior administration study agent . 6 . Disease Confirmation . At time biopsy , prior administration virus , presence recurrent tumor must confirm histopathological analysis . 7 . Informed Consent . A sign informed consent form approve Duke University Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) require patient enrollment study . Patients must able read understand inform consent document must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . 8 . Brain MRI . Able undergo brain MRI without contrast 1 . Pregnancy . Because unknown risk virus administration potentially affect develop fetus grow infant , female pregnant breastfeed study period exclude . Adults reproductive potential employ effective method birth control exclude . Sexually active woman child bear potential , whose partner male , must use medically accepted birth control . Sexually active men , whose partner female child bear potential , must use medically accepted birth control . 2 . Disease Status . Because patient receive drug intracerebrally , patient impend , lifethreatening cerebral herniation syndrome , base assessment study neurosurgeon , Allan Friedman John Sampson , designate , exclude . 3 . Medical Conditions . Because potential toxicity agent study protocol may similar know disease may dangerous context certain known disease , follow patient exclude avoid confound study result : Patients active infection require intravenous treatment unexplained febrile illness ( Tmax &gt; 99.5 F/37.5 C ) . Patients know immunosuppressive disease know human immunodeficiency virus infection . Unstable severe intercurrent medical condition severe heart ( New York Heart Association Class 3 4 ) know lung ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % ) disease , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Albumin allergy . Albumin add agent stabilizer . Patients know allergy exclude . Gadolinium allergy . Gadolinium use contrast MRI . 4 . Previous Poliomyelitis . A history neurological complication due poliovirus infection would imply previous virus replication CNS . Based animal study , previous exposure poliovirus administer intracerebrally reduce subsequent virus replication CNS . 5 . Prior Therapy . Patients recover toxic effect prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy exclude . Guidelines recovery period dependent upon specific therapeutic agent use : Patients may receive chemotherapy bevacizumab ≤ 4 week [ except nitrosourea ( 6 week ) metronomic dosed chemotherapy daily etoposide cyclophosphamide ( 1 week ) ] prior start study drug unless patient recovered side effect therapy . Patients may receive immunotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug unless patient recovered side effect therapy . Patients may less 12 week radiation therapy , unless progressive disease outside radiation field 2 progressive scan least 4 week apart histopathologic confirmation Patients must complete standard care treatment include surgical procedure radiation therapy ( least 59Gy ) : If MGMT promoter tumor know unmethylated , patient mandate received chemotherapy prior participate trial . If MGMT promoter tumor know methylated MGMT promoter status unknown time screening , patient must receive least one chemotherapy regimen prior participate trial . 6 . Location Extent Tumor . Because potential toxicity agent , patient neoplastic lesion brainstem , cerebellum spinal cord , radiological evidence multifocal disease , leptomeningeal disease . Patients evidence diffuse subependymal disease tumor brainstem , cerebellum , spinal cord , CSF exclude . Since study agent local treatment , patient radiological evidence active ( grow ) multifocal disease , tumor extend cross corpus callosum leptomeningeal disease , exclude . 7 . Subjects must diagnosis agammaglobulinemia . Patients follow exclude : Undetectable antitetanus toxoid IgG Known history agammaglobulinemia 8 . Patient great 4mg per day dexamethasone within 2 week prior admission PVSRIPO infusion 9 . Patient worsen steroid myopathy ( history gradual progression bilateral proximal muscle weakness , atrophy proximal muscle group ) 10 . Patients prior , unrelated malignancy require current active treatment exception cervical carcinoma situ adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin</criteria>
