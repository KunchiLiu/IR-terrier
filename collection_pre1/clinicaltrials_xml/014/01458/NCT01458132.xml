	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization estimate many 10 % population worldwide may point experience least one seizure . The percentage active epilepsy 0.4 % 1 % . From 40 % 65 % patient HIV infection estimate neurological involvement ; percentage reach high 70 % 80 % post-mortem assessment include . Estimates percentage HIV-infected patient seizure occurrence vary widely , one review find range 2 % 20 % . The high percentage range report center exclusively treated patient neurological involvement , India HIV clade C subtype predominant . Query another neurology department 's database determine HIV-infected patient treat center , refer neurological symptom , 6.1 % experienced seizure . Underlying neurologic disease patient include HIV-associated encephalopathy , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy , toxoplasmosis . In Spanish population , 3 % HIV-infected patient one-year study period find new-onset seizure , attribute drug toxicity 47 % , intracranial lesion 35 % , metabolic derangement 12 % . Drug-discontinuation study , magnetic resonance imaging study , animal study produce recent evidence antiretroviral therapy may neurotoxic effect , warrant research . Individuals treat highly active antiretroviral therapy risk immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) , immune recovery trigger clinical deterioration newly invigorate immune system react pathogens either represent ongoing opportunistic infection previously successfully control . In population initiate combination antiretroviral therapy 1999 2007 , 0.9 % developed neurological manifestation IRIS . Seizures may occur part neurological IRIS syndrome , encephalitis toxoplasmosis . Two randomized , Phase 2b dose-finding study conduct HIV-1 infected adult compare GSK2248761 100 mg 200 mg give daily part antiretroviral treatment regimen . One study ( SGN113399 ) subject prior exposure antiretroviral therapy GSK2248761 100 mg 200 mg daily compare determine best dose population . A contemporary control arm receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily also include , arm include twice-daily background therapy consist darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg plus raltegravir 400 mg . The study ( SGN113404 ) treatment-na√Øve subject , compare GSK2248761 100 mg 200 mg daily determine best dose population . A contemporary control arm receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily also include , arm give background therapy select investigator either once-daily abacavir/lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg tenofovir/emtricitabine 300 mg/200 mg. Of planned total population study 300 subject , 35 enrol study terminate occurrence seizure five subject . All subject experience seizure enrol SGN113399 , four randomize receive 200 mg GSK2248761 one randomize receive 100 mg GSK2248761 . There seizures subject receive GSK2248761 study SGN113404 . At time study termination , subject enrol receive GSK2248761 19 site four country : France , Romania , United States , Germany . Although potential contributory condition identify case , definitive causative factor seizure occurrence establish . The purpose study follow subject previously receive GSK2248761 enrol Phase 2b study , halt due unexpected seizure . The study collect data subject use monitor additional seizure well collect additional clinical data subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study collect monitor data subject previously receive GSK2248761 enrol Phase 2b study SGN113399 SGN113404 evaluate GSK2248761 . There formal hypothesis test , data collect utilized build individual subject narrative subject . All subject previously randomize Phase 2b study SGN113399 SGN113404 receive GSK2248761 target enrollment study . Study SGN11339 20 subject randomize receive GSK2248761 conduct 12 site United States one site Romania . Study SGN113404 conduct three site France three sit Germany , 15 subject randomize receive GSK2248761 . Therefore , study population current study consist 35 subject originate site locate United States , Romania , France , Germany . All subject enrol study previously receive GSK2248761 one Phase 2b clinical trial SGN113399 SGN113404 GSK2248761 treatment HIV . This study collect clinical safety data subject . Data subject ' medical chart collect point termination Phase 2b clinical trial . Any subject experienced seizure Phase 2b clinical trial follow two year . Subjects experienced seizure Phase 2b clinical trial follow one year . In event subject previously seizure experience seizure study period , subject move `` seizure subject group '' follow two year . Data collection occur quarterly basis subject . No formal analysis perform . All data collect subject incorporate narrative subject 's medical event follow-up period . The narrative recreate clinical course evolution disease history subject allow assessment evidence residual new adverse event potentially related exposure GSK2248761 . Listings AEs generate subject . Data AEs collect quarterly combine subject 's demographic medical history detail list report . The listing deliver GSK every six month coordination safety advisory committee meeting .</detailed_description>
