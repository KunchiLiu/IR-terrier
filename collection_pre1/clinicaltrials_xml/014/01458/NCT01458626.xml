	<brief_summary>Although treatment guideline manifest antidepressant response usually appear delay several week suggest treatment change partial response occur 4~6 week , beliefs longer held expert , new concept raise first 2 week treatment may useful strategy improve management depression . New evidence indicate early treatment response predict high sensitivity 2 week treatment patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Early improvement predict response remission , also lack improvement associate little chance response treatment strategy remain unchanged . The criterion 20 % score reduction choose early indicator improvement reliably measure clinical trial translate clinically relevant change severity depressive symptom . Antidepressants enhance serotonergic noradrenergic neurotransmission may effective selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) acute-phase therapy major depressive disorder . As noradrenergic specific serotonergic antidepressant , antidepressive mechanism mirtazapine quite superior SSRI particular suggest faster onset action SSRIs MDD patient . The aim study provide physician information regard early improvement effectiveness mirtazapine combine SSRI antidepressant therapy nonresponders .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study Mirtazapine Combined With Paroxetine Major Depressive Patients Without Early Improvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mirtazapine significant advantage response remission rate compare various SSRIs double-blind treatment . Mirtazapine combine SSRIs venlafaxine also find one effective successful strategy nonresponders MDD . The investigator hypothesize mirtazapine adjunctive treatment paroxetine boost onset time also improve antidepression action SSRIs patient without early improvement . The aim study provide physician information regard early improvement mirtazapine combine SSRI antidepressant therapy nonresponders , provide comparison depressive symptom outcomes associate adjunctive mirtazapine mono- paroxetine MDD patient previously treat paroxetine 2 week attain improvement . Paroxetine chosen comparator widely-used relatively well-tolerated SSRI antidepressant . The study design multi-center , randomize , double-blind , active-controlled trial subject MDD . Patients male female , 18 60 year age , inclusive , outpatient inpatient status , diagnosis major depressive episode ( single recurrent ) DSM-IV . The patient also HAMD-17 total score ≥ 20 , HAMD-17 Item 1 ( depressed mood ) score ≥ 2 enrollment open-label preliminary phase . It consist 2 phase . An open-label preliminary phase last 2 week , paroxetine titrate 20mg/day ( Day 5 ) . At Week 2 , patient evaluate HAMD-17 . The patient achieve early improvement ( decrease HAMD-17 total score ≥ 20 % ) discontinue . The patient achieve early improvement ( decrease HAMD-17 total score ＜ 20 % ) , randomize three treatment arm [ 1.Mirtazapine ( 30mg/d ) ; 2.Paroxetine ( 20mg/d ) ; 3.Mirtazapine ( 30mg/d ) +Paroxetine ( 20mg/d ) ] . In double-blind treatment phase ( consist 6 week ) , patient evaluate Week 3 , 4 , 6 8 . Primary efficacy measure assess base decrease HAMD-17 randomization ( Week 2 ) endpoint ( Week 8 ) . CGI-I CGI-S use secondary efficacy measure throughout phase . The safety study assess adverse event reporting , clinical laboratory measurement physical examination . Up 540 patient enter Open-label Phase order yield approximately 200 evaluable patient Randomization Phase .</detailed_description>
