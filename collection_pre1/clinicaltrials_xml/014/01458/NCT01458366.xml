	<brief_summary>The Phase I part study apply identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) new chemoimmunotherapy combination bendamustine , ofatumumab , carboplatin , etoposide patient Non Hodgkin 's lymphoma whose disease progress recurred prior chemotherapy . The Phase II part study single-arm , open-label study patient receive combination bendamustine , ofatumumab , carboplatin etoposide MTD dose define phase I . This study hop identify life-prolonging therapy patient Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma whose disease progress recurred prior chemotherapy . The hypothesis propose combination chemotherapy well-tolerated efficacious treatment relapsed/refractory aggressive B cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Combination With Ofatumumab , Carboplatin Etoposide Refractory Relapsed Aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty percent patient aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma expect relapse initial standard chemotherapy . There standard salvage regimen patient relapse refractory disease least 75 % patient expect succumb condition commonly use therapy . The recent CORAL study evaluate frequently use rescue regimens R-ICE ( rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ) vs. R-DHAP ( rituximab , dexamethasone , high-dose cytarabine cisplatin ) relapse aggressive lymphoma , overall response ( OR ) 83 % 3 year event-free survival ( EFS ) 47 % `` rituximab naïve '' patient . In contrast , OR 51 % 3 year EFS 21 % patient relapse rituximab contain regimen . There significant difference R-ICE R-DHAP ( 3-year EFS overall survival ) . This study confirm rituximab contain rescue less effective patient receive prior rituximab . Currently , virtually relapse B-cell lymphoma patient receive rituximab contain induction ; therefore , novel strategy need overcome rituximab resistance improve overall poor outcome relapse set . Ofatumumab human IgG1 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody bind different CD20 epitope presume destroy B cell insensitive rituximab due low CD20-expression due high bind avidity high antibody complement dependent cytotoxicity . It approve FDA treatment patient refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . It actively study low grade aggressive CD20 positive lymphoma . Bendamustine alkylator/purine analogue hybrid cytotoxic compound demonstrate single agent activity lymphomas refractory alkylating agent , cyclophosphamide . Weidmann et al ( 2002 ) demonstrate single agent activity safety bendamustine dose 120mg/m2 ( day 1 , 2 ) relapse/refractory aggressive lymphoma . This study ORR 44 % 18 patient . Non-hematological toxicity mild ( 13 % grade 3 0 grade 4 ) . Bendamustine show impressive activity favorable safety profile use combination rituximab cytotoxic drug : Weide R et al ( 2007 ) study bendamustine ( 90 mg/m2 day 1 , 2 ) combination rituximab mitoxantrone 57 patient ' indolent lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . ORR 92 % follicular 78 % MCL Vacirca et al present interim safety analysis bendamustine ( 120mg/m2 , day 1 , 2 ) rituximab combination aggressive B cell lymphoma 2010 ASCO meeting ( 76 cycle 1 grade 4 neutropenia 9 additional grade 3 event ) . Thus , bendamustine combination effective give safely patient relapse lymphoma . The investigator propose novel R-ICE-like salvage combination regimen rituximab substitute ofatumumab ifosfamide bendamustine combination carboplatin etoposide refractory relapse aggressive B cell lymphoma . The investigator hope avoid substantial ifosfamide mediate urinary bladder toxicity ( incidence grade 3 4 hemorrhagic cystitis 8-12 % ) neurologic toxicity ( 10-30 % : somnolence , confusion , psychosis seizure ) substitute ifosfamide bendamustine . The propose regimen convenient administer outpatient basis present additional benefit patient provider . The investigator propose phase I/II clinical trial first determine safety toxicity escalate dose bendamustine combination fix dose ofatumumab , carboplatin etoposide . The investigator recognize commonly use dos bendamustine lymphoid malignancy range 70-120 mg/m2 . The investigator determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) combination use dose escalation bendamustine 70mg/m2 standard 3 3 design . The investigator assess efficacy combination regimen relapse refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma .</detailed_description>
