	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate influence dietary sodium reduction body fluid volume inflammatory state hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . Design : Prospective control randomize study . Setting : Dialysis Unit Botucatu Medical School Hospital , Sao Paulo State University , Brazil . Patients : Adult patient HD least 30 day C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ≥ 0.7 mg/dl randomly allocate two group : Group A : 21 patient treat 2g sodium restriction habitual diet , Group B : 18 control . Inflammatory , biochemical , hematological nutritional marker , well dialysis dosage assess baseline 8 16 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prognosis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient strongly compromise cardiovascular ( CV ) complication . Inflammation establish major risk factor CV complication patient , occur approximately one third . Recently , grow evidence suggest body water volume expansion cause inflammation CKD . In previous study Rodrigues Telini show dietary sodium restriction reduce inflammatory marker level hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . Similar result observe patient treat reduction HD dialysate sodium concentration . However study significant reduction body volume marker observe . These result could due small number patient low sensibility volume marker ; hand could suggest direct role sodium inflammatory inducer independently volume . With large number patient use sensitive volume marker B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , study intend confirm hypothesis sodium mobilization reduce body water volume attenuate inflammatory HD patient . A hundred thirty-five patient enrol divided three group 35 patient : A , treat reduction 2 gram daily sodium intake ; B , expose reduction sodium dialysate 138 135 mEq/L C , control group . The patient follow 16 week inflammatory marker ( CRP , interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor ) well volume marker ( Watson formula , electrical bioimpedance measurement BNP concentration ) determine 8 week .</detailed_description>
