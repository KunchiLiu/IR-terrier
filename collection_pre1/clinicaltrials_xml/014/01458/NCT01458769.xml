	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics , Safety &amp; Tolerability Isotopologs Atazanavir ( ATV ) , With Pharmacokinetic Comparison Reyataz</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two part study . Part A three-period , crossover design . Eligible subject randomize 1 4 sequence , group 4 subject . All study drug dos , include comparator , Reyataz , administer single , open-labeled dos subject light meal . There 7-day washout individual subject dos ; , dose occur day week . Part B evaluation base result Part A . Part B consist two subpart . In first subpart , low single dos 2 new isotopologs dose two group 4 subject , B1 B2 , respectively . Following assessment safety pharmacokinetics first subpart , second subpart , consist three group 8 subject ( B3 , B4 , B5 ) dose . Subjects enrol B3 , B4 , B5 participate 3-way partial crossover study design . The objective compare PK property , healthy male subject light meal , single oral dos single agent ATV isotopologs combination two ATV isotopologs PK property subject , light meal , single dose either 400 mg 600 mg Reyataz . The safety tolerability also evaluate . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis collect . Actual dosing sample time use analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy , determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include history , physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) laboratory test assess screen visit prior first dose study drug . A subject nonclinically significant abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range may include investigator considers find compromise subject 's safety interfere study procedure data interpretation . Healthy adult male 18 50 year age , inclusive Body weight ≥ 50 kg BMI within range 18 32 kg/m2 , inclusive , screen Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol Willing able confine clinical research center study day Negative test select drug abuse , cotinine , alcohol screen Day 1 Dietary habit fall within range normal , determined investigator . Examples unusual diet liquid diet , proteinonly diet , high fatdiets , lowcarbohydrate diet . Willingness male subject abstain sexual intercourse pregnant lactating woman ; engage sexual intercourse female partner could become pregnant , willingness male subject use condom spermicide , addition female partner use another form contraception intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , oral contraceptive , injectable progesterone , subdermal implant , tubal ligation . This criterion must follow time first study drug administration 30 day final administration study drug . History clinically significant central nervous system ( eg , seizure ) , cardiac , pulmonary , metabolic , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal ( GI ) condition ; history condition , opinion investigator , may place subject unacceptable risk participant trial , may interfere interpretation safety and/or tolerability data obtain trial , may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion study drug PR interval ≥ 220 msec QRS duration ≥ 120 msec QT interval &gt; 450 msec obtain screen visit prior first dose study drug Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) , serum creatinine , bilirubin &gt; upper limit normal ( ULN ) screen prior first dose study drug . These laboratory test may repeat , abnormal first screening , medical reason believe result may inaccurate . If repeat test within reference range , subject may include investigator considers previous find compromise subject 's safety interfere interpretation safety data . Positive blood screen human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV antibody ) , hepatitis B virus surface antigen , hepatitis C virus antibody screen Urinalysis positive protein glucose ( great trace finding protein glucose ) screen prior first dose study drug History drug abuse within 6 month screen History tobacco product use within 3 month prior study , verified urine cotinine screen &lt; 200 ng/mL screen prior first dose study drug Participation clinical trial receipt investigational medication new chemical entity within 30 day , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect medication ( whichever longer ) prior first dose current study drug Use prescription nonprescription medication , include herbal dietary supplement within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study drug , use St. John 's Wort within 14 day prior first dose study drug . ( The subject may take paracetamol ( ≤ 2 grams/day ) ibuprofen ( ≤ 1600 mg/day ) 48 hour prior first dose study drug . The investigator study team may review medication use casebycase basis determine use would compromise subject safety interfere study procedure data interpretation . ) Consumption grapefruit , grapefruit juice , star fruit , orange , orange juice , Seville oranges , red wine within 7 day prior administration study drug Consumption caffeine and/or xanthine product ( ie , coffee , tea , chocolate caffeine contain soda , cola , etc ) within 48 hour prior dose study drug confine clinical site Donation blood blood product blood collection excess 470 mL within 8 week prior dose History sensitivity study drug component thereof , history medication allergy allergy , opinion investigator , contraindicate study participation Unwillingness comply protocolspecified lifestyle and/or dietary restriction Major surgery within 4 week screen Uncontrolled intercurrent illness ( ie , active infection ) Any medical psychiatric illness could , investigator 's opinion , compromise subject 's safety interfere completion protocol</criteria>
