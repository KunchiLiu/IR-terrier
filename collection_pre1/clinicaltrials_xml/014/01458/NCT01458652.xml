	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggest increased oxidative stress ( OxSt ) well inflammation risk factor cardiovascular event hemodialysis patient . The incremental effect online haemodiafiltration ( OL-HDF ) marker microinflammation , OxSt less clear . Besides , relationship protein-bind uremic toxin microinflammation remain obscure . The aim study evaluate effect volume replacement on-line hemodiafiltration proinflammatory peripheral monocyte ( percentage CD14+CD16+ cell ) , PAF , IL-6 plasma level several oxidative stress marker well several protein-bound uremic toxin p-cresol , indole sulfate etc . In case control study , 30 patient OL-HDF evaluate . The association protein-bound uremic toxin p-cresol , indole sulfate etc AST-120 , spherical adsorptive carbon preparation ( Kremezin ) also investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background High convection volume OL-HDF technique constitute progress towards renal replacement therapy similar native kidney . These technique offer high clearance uremic substance great range molecular size , require use biocompatible membrane ultrapure dialysis fluid , associate additional clinical benefit . The superiority OL-HDF HD suggest result several study . Solute removal capacity uremic toxin enhance huge volume substitution OL-HDF . Most clinical study agree OL-HDF permit similar slight large reduction rate small solute per session HD : 70-80 % urea ( 60 dalton ( da ) . Using b2M solute marker large uremic toxin , show control study reduction ratio b2M per session 20-30 % high OL-HDF high-flux HD ( 72.7 versus 49.7 % ) , regular use OL-HDF significantly reduce circulating level predialysis b2M ( median value 20 mg/l ) It also show OL-HDF remove large solute myoglobin ( 16 kDa ) retinol-binding protein ( 25 kDa ) .The capacity remove middle-sized peptide substance positively correlate convective clearance amount fluid exchange per session , enhance convective clearance achieve OL-HDF primary mechanism remove large uremic solute . It also show OL-HDF reduces circulate level advance glycation end product putatively imply dialysis-related complication long-term dialysis patient Recently , one large observational cohort study robust adjustment demographic comorbid confound factor show association lower mortality risk OL-HDF . In study , find OL-HDF group receive high fluid volume exchange ( &gt; 15 l per session ) significantly substantially lower risk death ( RR=0.65 , P=0.01 ) .A large number retain large solute protein-bound compound involve uremic toxicity . Among p-cresol indole sulfate etc , seem relate deleterious biological clinical effect difficult remove dialysis . Particularly , protein-bound toxin represent challenge extracorporeal renal replacement strategy unbound , mostly low-molecular solute pas current dialysis membrane bound fraction retain . p-cresol indoxyl sulfate ( IS ) among frequently study protein-bound toxin patient end-stage renal disease . . Similar protein-bound compound , p-cresyl sulfate ( PCS ) poorly remove hemodialysis protein bind high ratio distribution volume clearance . Compared low-flux , high-flux dialysis membrane generally enhance elimination protein-bound toxin , albumin-leaking super-flux membrane superior especially remove indoxyl sulfate ( IS ) . One previous study suggest protein-bound solute ( p-cresol ) may efficiently remove high-efficiency HDF highflux HD discrepant result suggest one recent study .Uraemic toxins accumulate lead uraemic syndrome glomerular filtration rate decline . Earlier study , include Hemodialysis ( HEMO ) trial Adequacy Dialysis Mexico ( ADMEX ) trial , show increase removal water-soluble solute current target reduce mortality dialysis patient . This finding indicate uremic solute , small water-soluble molecule , may play role patient outcome . Some recent study suggest non-diabetics hemodialysis , free p-cresol serum concentration significantly associate cardiovascular disease may help predict overall mortality patient group . The interrelation p-cresyl sulfate ( PCS ) , main vivo metabolite p-cresol , vascular disease uremia may derive pro-inflammatory effect unstimulated leucocyte lead oxidative stress , consequently , atherosclerosis . An vitro study reveal p-cresol also depress respiratory burst activity phagocyte , inhibit plate- let-activating factor synthesis reduce endothelial cell response inflammatory cytokine . Further evidence indicate p-cresol play major role endothelial dysfunction , characteristic uremic syndrome . Similarly , IS may significant role vascular disease high mortality observe CKD patient . Apart early study report toxic biologic effect IS , report IS ( similar concentration find CKD patient ) capable inhibit endothelial cell proliferation thus impair endothelium self-healing ability . Yamamoto et al . show IS stimulate proliferation rat vascular smooth muscular cell vitro . Itwas subsequently demonstrate IS induces aortic calcification vivo rat model hypertension , aortic wall thicken expression osteoblast-specific protein .Since 1991 , carbonaceous adsorbent AST-120 available treat patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) Japan . Nonetheless , many country commonly use . In animal model CKD , AST-120 remove uremic toxin reduces oxidative . Years ago , Niwa et al show AST-120 effective reduce serum concentration albumin-bound indoxyl sulphate hemodialysis patient adsorption indole intestine , relieve itching hemodialysis patient generalise pruritus . It noteworthy AST-120 adsorbs hydro- phobic uremic toxin IS attenuate oxidative stress generate latter—has show favorably influence CKD relate cardiovascular outcome animal clinical study . Accordingly , CKD rat model oxidative stress induce adriamycin , Fujii et al . demonstrate rat treat AST-120 low level IS , small heart leave ventricular volume , cardiac fibrosis , low histologic expression urinary excretion oxidative stress marker nontreated control , despite similar renal function . In line finding , report AST-120 give CKD patient dialysis initiation improve overall survival rate comparison CKD patient AST-120 administer . Lastly , recent study AST-120 administer predialysis CKD patient 2 yr , significant reduction carotid intimamedia thickness PWV report AST-120 group compare receive AST-120 .In present study , investigator attempt compare effect low high replacement volume removal protein-bound toxin LMW proteins prevalent ESRD patient receive online high-efficiency post-dilution hemodiafiltration . In addition , investigator evaluate effect adsorptive measure , AST-120 , inflammatory oxidative status dialysis patient . Research design method Patients 30 stable chronic dialysis patient receive OL-HDF patient treat &gt; 3 month include study . Only non-smoking patient without recent infection without intake antibiotic immunosuppressive agent last 2 week study select . Study design The study conduct case-control study . Stable chronic kidney disease stage 5 patient regular three time weekly maintenance dialysis enrol study give write informed consent . The patient 's concomitant medication continue unchanged manner . Each patient underwent randomly one study week three consecutive haemodiafiltration treatment polysulphone dialysis membrane . Haemodiafiltration perform use Fresenius 4008 H monitor ( Fresenius Medical Care , Bad Homburg , Germany ) . The ultrafiltration flow rate ( QUF ) session set accord individual patient 's interdialytic weight gain . Anticoagulation perform unchanged adoption previous routine heparinization Treatment duration , QB QD , well infusion flow rate ( QI ) post-dilution haemodiafiltration keep constant patient 3 months.At silent study , patient receive OL-HDF randomize 2 arm , namely replacement volume ≦ 15 L &amp; &gt; 15 L.After 2 month , replacement volume group &lt; 15 L replacement volume increase &gt; 15 L another 2 month ( Group A ) . Those &gt; 15 L replacement volume keep unchanged ( Group B ) . After 2 month , patient group A randomize take AST-120 3 month show Figure 1All sample blood collect midweek dialysis AV fistula , immediately insertion dialysis cannula administration heparin . Blood collect dialysis 3 occasion namely month 0 , 3 6 m. Blood dialysis drawn Blood sample 4 cc Venoject II tube centrifuge ( 10 min , 3000 r.p.m. ) . Serum immediately store -20°C assay .</detailed_description>
