	<detailed_description>Maroteaux-Lamy disease ( MPS VI ) lysosomal storage disease inherit autosomal recessive pattern . The responsible mutation lie ARSB ( 5q11-q13 ) , gene encodes enzyme arylsulfatase B . The phenotype result defective dermatan sulfate breakdown lysosomal accumulation . This accumulation glycosaminoglycans responsible widespread sign symptom find disease . Bone destruction shoulder , hip skull often see second decade life may become evident later knee spine . Early growth may normal eventually slow result short stature . Dysplasia bone comprise joint lead stiffness restrict movement . The face dysmorphic coarse feature . Bone dysplasia facial dysmorphism may see birth . Myelopathy even tetraplegia result vertebral compression . Intelligence often normal although severely affected individual may cognitive defect due impaired vision hearing . Hepatosplenomegaly common compromise respiratory function result reduce physical stamen . The tongue usually enlarge . Accumulation dermatan sulfate heart valve may produce insufficiency restriction outflow . A diagnosis Maroteaux-Lamy disease confirm screening common genetic mutation measure level arylsulfatase B enzyme activity blood sample -- test 100 percent accuracy . Once Maroteaux-Lamy disease diagnose , test family member consultation professional geneticist recommend . Carriers reliably identify via genetic mutation analysis . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize blood ( plasma ) affect patent specific metabolic alteration allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study develop new biochemical marker plasma affected patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
