	<brief_title>Trial To Assess The Lipid-Lowering Effect Of Adding Tenofovir/Emtricitabine Co-Formulation Vs Placebo To Hiv-1-Infected Subjects With Dyslipidemia And Sustained Viral Load Suppression Under Monotherapy With Ritonavir-Boosted Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IV , multicenter , , prospective , randomise , crossover , double blind , placebo‐controlled proof concept clinical trial . The trial conduct total sample 60 patient ( 30 patient per group ) , assure adequate power detect difference . This study adequate demonstrate lipid-lowering effect TDF/FTC co-formulation addition patient dyslipidemia stable monotherapy antiretroviral treatment . All subject fulfil inclusion criterion randomise add either TDF/FTC co-formulation ( group A ) placebo ( Group B ) current PI/r regimen , i.e . : DRV/r 800/100 mg QD LPV/r 400/100 BID . This follow crossover addition TDF/FTC co-formulation placebo . In Group A expect change cholesterol value , regard baseline , observe 3 month TDF/FTC addition . After , period 3 month placebo act washout period , allow establish comparison intra-patient . Finally , another period 3 month placebo permit establish comparison first 3-month TDF/FTC intervention . In Group B , subject follow 3-month placebo period , later 3-month TDF/FTC intervention finally placebo period act wash-out . Randomization centralise CRO FLS-Research Support stratify DRV/r LPV/r intake baseline ensure equal distribution arm . TDF/FTC co-formulation Placebo provide double-blinded fashion , i.e . : neither treat physician patient know whether patient receive TDF/FTC placebo . All subject receive dietary counsel promote lipid-lowering diet provide specialised dietician throughout study . The expected duration study participant 36 week . There 6 visit : screening , baseline week 4 , 12 , 24 36 . The date inclusion first patient November 2011 end last patient follow-up February 2014 . The enrolment period 18 month . The final study report submit November 2014 .</detailed_description>
