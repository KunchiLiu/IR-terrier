	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EE ) condition eosinophil ( cell fight infection ) travel esophagus ( tube food pass stomach ) . These cell belong cause pain , soreness , difficulty swallow sometimes vomit . Ways treat condition include medicine , eat food , drink specific formula ( like milk ) without eat food . Doing thing help fight EE problem come back treatment stop . If EE symptom go long time , lead esophagus become narrow feel tight eat swallow surgery may need widen narrow area relieve sensation tighten . Montelukast medicine fight type chemical magnet eosinophil . People usually take medicine help treat asthma . It approve treat EE . This medication take day . The purpose study see Montelukast , compare placebo , help reduce number eosinophil child EE help stop tightening esophagus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Montelukast Maintenance Therapy Eosinophilic Esophagitis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) disease diagnose use clinical pathologic result . Presentation vary among age group young child suffer vomiting , failure thrive , food refusal adolescent suffer dysphagia , odynophagia , food impaction . It prevalent male . EE suggest upper endoscopy yield eosinophils great 15 per high power field ( hpf ) middle distal esophagus . Therapy EE depend upon age ability compliant . Three main category treatment option family , include use medicine , removal allergenic food , use elemental diet ( formula ) ( 1-2 ) . Treatment different within two main phase therapy EE , initial maintenance therapy . Initial therapy occur patient first diagnose eosinophil 15 per hpf last year patient respond treatment . Maintenance therapy occur patient respond treatment reduction his/her eosinophil count 5 per hpf . Typically , medicinal therapy steroid ( either oral prednisone swallow fluticasone ) improve eosinophil count large side effect profile suggest steroid ideal maintenance therapy . Dietary therapy effective treatment phase many patient find difficult remain compliant food restriction prolong length time . Unfortunately , EE recur upon withdrawal oral therapy ( 3-7 ) . EE believe imbalance TH1/TH2 immune system prevalent patient asthma allergy ( 8-9 ) . Some EE center start treat patient target elimination diet elemental diet good success . Unfortunately , family particular teenager , noncompliant dietary therapy . Formula elemental diet cover insurance costly well . Therefore , find drug would keep patient EE maintenance therapy reduce long term consequence steroids potential esophageal stricture would ideal . Many adult EE present dysphagia food impaction subsequently find esophageal stricture require multiple esophageal dilatation treatment . Esophageal subepithelial fibrosis find adult literature patient EE . Chehade et al evaluated distal esophageal biopsy specimens child EE , eosinophilic gastroenteritis , gastroesophageal reflux disease , control presence increase collagen deposition indicative fibrosis . They find fibrosis present 57 % patient EE , 42 % symptom dysphagia 80 % food impaction . The degree fibrosis associate eosinophil count associate eosinophilic degranulation ( 10 ) . Upon degranulation , eosinophils release major basic protein ( MBP ) transform growth factor ( TGF-β ) . MBP change smooth muscle contractility block M2 muscarinic receptor therefore change motility esophagus . TGF-β believe cause increase production extracellular matrix smooth muscle hypertrophy hyperplasia lead esophageal thickening fibrosis . TGF-β key growth factor increase fibroblast subsequent fibrosis lung well . Corticosteroids show reverse esophageal remodeling , large clinical trial evaluate treatment esophageal fibrosis relate EE . To quote Aceves Ackerman : `` [ f ] ibrosis likely contribute multiple clinical aspect EE , include dysphagia symptom , disease chronicity , stricture formation . '' Fibrosis measure esophageal tissue evaluate amount collagen deposit . Trichrome stain specifically collagen ( 11 ) . Patients EE abundance inappropriate cell within esophagus , include eosinophil mast cell . A normal esophagus devoid eosinophil . Mast cell likely active role development eosinophilic esophagitis ; unfortunately precise mechanism unknown . Mast cell find majority vascularize tissue abundant gastrointestinal tract . They locate submucosa lamina propria . Within esophagus specifically , find mucosa submucosa rare expansion muscularis layer . With severe eosinophilic inflammation , mast cell see muscularis layer . Biopsies patient EE demonstrate marked increase mast cell mucosal layer esophagus . There correlation mast cell number degree eosinophilia . Mast cell within GI tract contain tryptase well preformed mediator synthesize mediator promote inflammation . Tryptase may activate eosinophil therefore induce eosinophilic degranulation cytokine secretion . Mast cell release chemokines leukotrienes specific eosinophil recruitment . Ultimately mast cell mediator worsen edema , create inflammation , induce smooth muscle contractility potentially affect tissue fibrosis . Therefore , active mast cell proinflammatory , modify esophageal function , encourage development stricture ( 12 ) . Mast cell may key component propagation inflammatory state well significant importance development fibrosis . Evaluating tryptase level could lead good understand inflammatory process ultimate problem fibrosis . Eosinophils mast cell contain leukotrienes abundance . Cysteinyl leukotrienes inflammatory mediator derive arachidonic acid . They important eosinophil attraction migration , smooth muscle bronchoconstriction , vascular permeability , mucus hypersecretion ( 13 ) . Montelukast leukotriene receptor antagonist block specifically leukotriene D4 ( LTD4 ) receptor . Attwood et al treat 8 patient EE Montelukast 6 report complete subjective improvement 5 remain asymptomatic maintenance regimen . Treatment Montelukast change density eosinophils present esophagus however ( 14 ) . Montelukast use mouse model decrease fibrosis occur liver lung . El-Swefy Hassanen perform randomize study subject mice one 4 group , bile duct ligation plus saline , bile duct ligation plus montelukast , bile duct ligation plus montelukast bile duct ligation plus saline . Bile duct ligation induce inflammation lead cirrhosis fibrosis . They find bile duct ligation increase amount TGF-β , correlate amount fibrosis find . Of import montelukast significantly reduce amount fibrosis well decreased amount TGF-β ( 15 ) . Izumo , Kondo , Nagai evaluate use montelukast prevention pulmonary fibrosis exposure bleomycin . They find mice give montelukast significantly low level TGF-β fibrosis lung ( 16 ) . The investigator 's research focus throughout fellowship include several retrospective study eosinophilic esophagitis . One investiagotor 's study evaluate management initial maintenance therapy EE within department . The investigator want know medicine majority pediatric gastroenterologist investigator 's institution use treat EE often patient reevaluate endoscopy . The investigator also want evaluate use montelukast treatment EE . The investigator review 1500 chart patient undergone upper endoscopy result `` esophagitis . '' Patients select presence great equal 20 eosinophil per high power field least one biopsy location . Of 1500 chart investigator evaluate , 88 patient fulfil criterion EE . The investigator discover consistent standard care within department initial maintenance treatment EE . Many different medicine trialed initially patient undergo esophageal biopsy different time interval , contrary recommend . The primary group 88 patient separate 49 patient reach maintenance therapy ( define less 5 eosinophil per high power field ) 39 patient never experience improvement eosinophil count . Of 49 reached maintenance therapy , 30 patient treat montelukast follow endoscopy . The investigator evaluate peak eosinophil count pre post treatment , contrary hypothesis , patient treat 5mg montelukast low post treatment eosinophil count treat high dos ( 10 20mg ) . This raise possibility packaging difference two main dos impact treatment . The investigator consider possibility lower dosage montelukast protective since 5mg tablet chewable would yield topical effect esophagus whereas 10mg tablet swallow , chew . In addition , investigator evaluate often EE recur discover high rate histologic recurrence . Also interest investigator low recurrence rate patient give 5mg montelukast compare 10mg 20mg dos . These result expect deserve evaluation . If montelukast prevent fibrosis topical effect , therapeutic potential huge treatment EE . The investigator develop study investigate use montelukast total v placebo well allow look dose effect within montelukast treatment eosinophilic esophagitis . The primary objective evaluate montelukast keep eosinophil count low enough patient remain remission , particular dose montelukast achieve great proportion . All patient maintain proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) baseline patient receive placebo still receive standard care treatment . Many GI practitioner institution place patient EE montelukast part standard care treatment vary dos without good literature support use . The investigator 's goal determine montelukast valuable therapy treatment EE . The investigator 's study also evaluate histological stain may show improvement use montelukast , even eosinophil count change , chemical release eosinophil mast cell may primary import continuation EE .</detailed_description>
