	<brief_summary>Patients Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) chronic respiratory insufficiency ( CRI ) severe dyspnoea exercise low load . Physiological study perform patient unique session train show positive effect exercise tolerance non-invasive mechanical ventilation ( NIV ) add incremental effort test endurance . Menadue coworkers ( 2009 ) show CRI patient hypercapnia , secondary COPD cifoscoliosis , combination NIV arm effort test improve ability perform exercise . Similar result reach use NIV walking . Further study underline positive effect ventilation therapy exercise within specific program pulmonary rehabilitation ( Corner 2009 ) . Moreover , addition NIV exercise training ( ET ) program COPD patient may produce great benefit exercise tolerance quality life exercise train alone ( Garrod 2000 ) . A great improvement health-related quality life , functional status gas exchange COPD patient chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure nocturnal NIV compare patient pulmonary rehabilitation alone also show Duieverman ( 2008 ) . However , study Duieverman show significant difference group term tolerance effort test . Aim study evaluate application daily NIV physical training may increase benefit rehabilitation CRI patient nocturnal NIV compare patient nocturnal NIV perform train spontaneous breathing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency Patients During Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTERVENTION Group 1 ( NIV train + nocturnal NIV ) : This group patient use usual NIV night perform rehabilitative program least 20 session train cycloergometer NIV . NO INTERVENTION Group 2 ( train Spontaneous Breathing [ SB ] + nocturnal NIV ) : This group patient use usual NIV night train rehabilitative daily program without NIV . This group consider `` control '' group . Sessions : 30 minutes/session , 2 times/day , 4-5 time week total 20-25 session 3 week . Intensity : patient start 50 % individual 's maximum work capacity ( cycloergometer ) increase maximum tolerate , accord Maltais 's protocol . NIV SETTING : Training : Facial mask usual setting ( Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure [ IPAP ] 10-15 ; Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure [ EPAP ] 4-6 cmH20 ) possible adjustment agreement comfort . The adjustment ventilation training within first 3 session accord follow protocol : COPD patient : increase 3 cmH2Os EPAP decrease 3 cmH2Os IPAP . Restricted patient : increase 3 cmH2Os IPAP . Nocturnal ventilation : mask usual set The primary outcome study evaluation effort tolerance measure 6 minute Walking Test ( 6-min Walking Test ) . The hypothesis verify percentage variation two group equal 10 % rehabilitative program . To get study power 80 % alpha error &lt; 5 % 25 patient group enrol .</detailed_description>
