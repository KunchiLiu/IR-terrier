	<detailed_description>Study Title : Outside USA [ OUS ] Pilot Multi-center prospective feasibility study Objectives : Primary : To establish safety preliminary efficacy Check-Cap System patient negative FOBT ( Fecal Occult Blood Test ) FIT Secondary : - To evaluate safety device term total segmental transit time study effect presence polyp variable colon dimension parameter . - To monitor functionality activation mechanism scan circuitry ( transmitter detector ) . - To collect data overall imaging colon internal surface passage capsule - To develop correlation map image polyps optical colonoscopy vs. image polyps Check-Cap capsule vs. image polyp CT Colonography ( patient refer positive CTC examination ) - To estimate total radiation exposure patient . - To measure distribution contrast material within colon . Design : Prospective , Single arm , Multi-Center Patient population : Group A - First Man : Male female subject older 40 young 75 year old eligible CRC screen meet eligibility criterion study enrollment . The study population enrich 45 patient know polyp detect CTC colonoscopy , addition 15 patient device 's normal cohort . All patient eligible enrollment study test FOBT ( Fecal Occult Blood Test ) After Capsule test , refer optical colonoscopy part study Group B - CE Pilot : Male female subject older 45 young 75 year old eligible CRC screen meet eligibility criterion study enrollment . All patient eligible enrollment study test FIT , . After Capsule test refer optical colonoscopy Consenting patient negative FIT test schedule clinically-indicated optical colonoscopy without contraindication either Check-Cap System image optical colonoscopy , able undergo bowel preparation necessary optical colonoscopy . Sample Size : Total 100 patient group : A:3-5 + B : 55-57 subject . Study Procedure : 1. st visit - recruitment screen meeting Principal Investigator [ PI ] . Subject receive FIT test kit detail instruction execute test . 2. nd visit - The FIT kit analyze order diagnose presence blood stool . If bowel log form complete bowel frequency less per 2 day subject ask sign Informed Consent Form [ ICF ] ingest capsule . 3. rd visit - Subject ingest capsule continue ingestion contrast material . 4. th visit - Subjects return PI excrete capsule expect within 24-100 hour ingestion . 5. th visit - All patient undergo standard bowel preparation optical colonoscopy 10 30 day follow image Check-Cap System .</detailed_description>
