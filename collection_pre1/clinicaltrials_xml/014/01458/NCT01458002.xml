	<brief_summary>This study target two major risk factor cancer ; design treat behavior population basis , use proactive recruitment strategy ; intervenes multiple behavior simultaneously , thereby produce great impact cancer prevention ; utilize one promising approach low cost population base intervention health-related behavior change , namely internet ; develop test promise new approach increase utilization effectiveness internet-based intervention , relational agent . The primary aim : ( 1 ) To develop assess effectiveness tailor internet intervention national sample ; ( 2 ) To develop assess effectiveness internet intervention enhance relational agent ; ( 3 ) To determine intervention relational agent outperform regular tailor internet intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Online Tailored Interventions &amp; Relational Agents Exercise Sun Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarch goal research project revise enhance multimedia computer-based multiple risk factor intervention cancer prevention , use internet reach general population . Two innovative , individualized , easily disseminate , low-cost , interactive intervention , multiple behavior ( sun protection exercise adoption ) , develop evaluate comparison control condition . The first intervention involve adapt effective multimedia expert system intervention internet environment . The second intervention build first additional inclusion Relational Agent , recently develop computer-based approach establish personal relationship typically miss internet site . Both system employ theoretical model behavior change , Transtheoretical Model , deep knowledge , system employ empirically base decision rule . The design 3 Group ( Control , Internet , Internet plus Relational Agent ) x 3 Occasions ( 0 , 12 , 24 â€¢ Months ) intervention occur first 12 month . A representative national sample 1639 individual risk behavior recruit . The primary aim : ( 1 ) To develop assess effectiveness tailor internet intervention national sample ; ( 2 ) To develop assess effectiveness internet intervention enhance relational agent ; ( 3 ) To determine intervention relational agent outperform regular tailor internet intervention . The secondary aim : ( 1 ) To determine two intervention differentially effective behavior different subgroup , ( 2 ) To determine relational agent intervention utilize often increase exercise sun protection . This study target two major risk factor cancer ; design treat behavior population basis , use proactive recruitment strategy ; intervenes multiple behavior simultaneously , thereby produce great impact cancer prevention ; utilize one promising approach low cost population base intervention health-related behavior change , namely internet ; develop test promise new approach increase utilization effectiveness internet-based intervention , relational agent .</detailed_description>
