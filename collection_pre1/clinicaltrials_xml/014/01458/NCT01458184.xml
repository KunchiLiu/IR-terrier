	<detailed_description>TLC-C modification exist TLC-Multi-Disease system target patient multiple chronic disease combine post-hospital discharge intervention ( TLC-RED-Lit ) . TLC-C us conversational computer telephony monitor patient ' multiple disease ambulatory care visit . The system work routine ( patient stable ) exacerbation ( patient unstable ) mode . The system monitor patient `` virtual visit '' detects notifies clinician important clinical problem attend . It also promote patient self-care ( e.g. , medication adherence appointment preparation ) . In emergent situation system recommend go local Emergency Department ( ED ) . In urgent situation , alert send clinician his/her coverage provider . Exacerbation mode use patient discharge hospital inpatient service ED worsening symptom . It concentrate exacerbate disease monitor patient status ( improve , stable deteriorating ) . Daily contact maintain patient 's status improve . Routine mode occur patient baseline status monitor disease patient ' self-care behavior . The investigator propose perform multi-method evaluation study patient , provider , practice . This include 2-arm randomized clinical trial TLC-C versus usual care patient two chronic disease , least one previous episode acute hospital utilization last 12 month , recently discharge urban hospital . The randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate system 440 patient follow 6 month . The primary outcome acute hospital care utilization ( unplanned hospitalization ED visit ) . Secondary outcome include patient quality life ( EuroQol 5D [ EQ-5D ] ) , satisfaction ( Clinician Group Survey [ G-CAHPS ] ) , ambulatory appointment show rate net payer cost . The investigator explore disease specific metric ( e.g. , hemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ] blood pressure ) . The investigator perform formative summative qualitative study implementation system , use performance time , impact patient , provider practice whole .</detailed_description>
