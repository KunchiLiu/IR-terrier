	<brief_summary>Post-operative antibiotic infection prophylaxis routinely give surgical patient , orthopaedic surgery patient , standard care treatment 24 hour follow elective procedure ( 1 ) . The concern risk insufficient antibiotic coverage post-operative period development complicate infection require irrigation debridement revision surgery . Moreover , recovery surgery usually delay patient postoperative wound infection lead increase resource utilization increase economic cost health care system . It clear prophylactic antibiotic therapy necessary immediate post-operative period , length require continue debate . Orthopaedic patient undergo elective spine surgery often require placement hemovac drain applies gentle suction remove excess fluid/blood promote healing . Wound drain , however , may also increase risk post-operative infection expose `` clean '' interior aspect wound `` dirty '' exterior area around wound . Given additional focus infection , unknown whether prolonged antibiotic therapy post-operatively need decrease rate infection population ( 2,3 ) . There sparse literature evaluate effectiveness prolong antibiotic therapy decrease complicate post-operative infection require irrigation debridement population ( 1,4 ) . To knowledge , recent study compare prophylactic antibiotic 24 hour post-operatively versus 24 hour removal drain . In fact , recent evidence-based review literature North American Spine Society highlight need research area ( 5 ) . The propose study compare two patient population receive various lengths post-operative antibiotic . One receive 24 hour worth , receive antibiotic 72 hour surgery rate complicate infection compare two . The absence demonstrable difference suggest antibiotic prophylaxis 24 hour immediately post-operatively sufficient elective spine patient undergo posterior spine procedure require placement hemovac drain .</brief_summary>
