	<brief_title>Cis-urocanic Acid ( Cis-UCA ) Patients With Primary Recurrent Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single dose , dose-escalating , Phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics intravesical cis-urocanic acid ( cis-UCA ) patient primary recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability cis-UCA single intravesical instillation escalate dos determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) cis-UCA single intravesical instillation escalate dos . The secondary objective evaluate pharmacokinetics cis-UCA single intravesical instillation escalate dos , obtain preliminary information possible anti-tumor effect cis-UCA cystoscopy histological evaluation single intravesical instillation escalate dos , evaluate effect cis-UCA different surrogate biochemical marker tumor growth differentiation single intravesical instillation escalate dos . The key eligibility criterion follow : Patients primary recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ; eligible intravesical treatment ; age 18-80 year ; WHO performance status 0-2 ; acceptable liver , renal hematological function within 30 day prior inclusion . At minimum 3 patient maximum 24 patient plan include study . The fixed dose-escalation level use . Up three dose cohort plan include : - Cohort I : 2 % cis-UCA solution ( 50 ml ) ; min 3 , max 12 patient - Cohort II : 4 % cis-UCA solution ( 50 ml ) ; min 0 , max 12 patient - Cohort III : 6 % cis-UCA solution ( 50 ml ) ; min 0 , max 12 patient</detailed_description>
