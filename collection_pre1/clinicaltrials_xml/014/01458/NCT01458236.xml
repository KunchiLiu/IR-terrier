	<brief_title>A Multinational , Multicenter , Study Assess Efficacy Safety BPS-314d-MR Subjects With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Currently Receiving Treatment With Endothelin Receptor Antagonist and/or Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate efficacy safety BPS-314d-MR subject PAH treat background therapy ERA and/or PDE-5 inhibitor . Subjects consent study assess Screening Baseline visit determine eligibility study . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Baseline visit enrol study treat either active placebo study drug . The subject , clinical site staff Sponsor blind treatment assignment . Treatment assignment random . Following Baseline visit , subject return clinical site Week 6 , Week 12 , Week 20 every 12 week thereafter . Subjects undergo schedule efficacy safety assessment , define protocol . Between schedule clinical site visit , clinical site staff require contact subject telephone call ass tolerability study drug change subject 's dosage appropriate . Telephone call occur least weekly first 20 study week dose change occur frequently subject become familiar study procedure . Telephone call occur least monthly thereafter . Subjects provide electronic diary record dose take help track health issue conversation clinical site staff . Subjects continue participation study Sponsor formally close study . At time subject return clinical site End Treatment visit complete schedule test . Subjects participate study conclusion may offer opportunity enroll long-term extension study . Subjects continue extension study require discontinue study drug . Subjects urge remain study long-term follow-up even study drug discontinue . In event subject withdraws consent participation study Investigator terminate subject study subject return clinical site End Treatment visit complete schedule test . After study drug permanently discontinue , subject terminate study , subject return clinical site 30-37 day final Safety Follow-up visit return remain study drug . The optional Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) evaluation offer study subject clinical site . Subjects within site decide wish participate optional PK evaluation . For subject elect participate , two blood sample collect three clinical site visit ( Weeks 6 , 12 20 ) . The optional hemodynamic sub-study offer study subject clinical site . All subject select research center offer opportunity volunteer sub-study . Hemodynamic measurement assess Right Heart Catheterization ( RHC ) . For subject consent RHC , RHC procedure perform Baseline visit Week 20 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , age 18 80 year ( inclusive ) . 2 . Established diagnosis pulmonary arterial hypertension either idiopathic familial PAH , collagen vascular disease associate PAH , PAH induce anorexigens/toxins , PAH associate repaired congenital systemictopulmonary shunt ( repair ≥5 year ) . 3 . Clinically stable PAH determine Investigator . 4 . Able walk unassisted ( oxygen use allow ) . 5 . A 6Minute Walk distance ( 6MWD ) 150 450 meter ( inclusive ) Screening . 6 . A 6MWD Baseline visit within 15 % Screening 6MWD . 7 . An average 6MWD ( Screening Baseline visit ) 150 450 meter ( inclusive ) . 8 . Previous ( within five year prior Baseline visit ) right heart cardiac catheterization ( RHC ) finding consistent PAH , specifically mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure ( PAPm ) ≥25 mmHg ( rest ) , Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure ( PCWP ) ( leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ) ≤15 mmHg , Pulmonary Vascular Resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 3 mmHg/L/min . 9 . Previous ( within five year prior Baseline visit ) chest radiograph consistent diagnosis PAH . 10 . Has current background regimen ERA and/or PDE5 inhibitor minimum 90 day least 30 day stable dose ERA and/or PDE5 inhibitor prior Baseline visit . 11 . Women childbearing potential ( define less 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterile ) must practice abstinence use two highly effective method contraception ( define method birth control result low failure rate , i.e. , less 1 % per year , approve hormonal contraceptive , barrier method [ condom diaphragm ] use spermicide , intrauterine device ) . Subject must negative pregnancy test Screening Baseline visit . 12 . Willing able comply study requirement restriction . 1 . Has pulmonary venous hypertension , pulmonary venoocclusive disease , pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis , chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . 2 . As diagnosis PAH may challenge subject multiple comorbid condition , subject presence two follow comorbid condition : Diabetes Age &gt; 70 year Body Mass Index [ BMI ] &gt; 35 Past history pulmonary embolism Chronic atrial fibrillation FEV1 &lt; 70 % predict Systemic hypertension require treatment . AND Sponsor concur , write , appropriateness subject enter study . 3 . Has history interstitial lung disease , unless subject collagen vascular disease pulmonary function test conduct within 6 month Baseline visit demonstrate total lung capacity ≥70 % predict . 4 . Has history obstructive lung disease , unless subject pulmonary function test conduct within 6 month Baseline visit demonstrate forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 50 % predict . 5 . Is pregnant lactate . 6 . Has receive prostanoid therapy time . 7 . Modified dose , initiate discontinue PAH medication within 30 day prior Baseline visit include , limited , ERA , PDE5 inhibitor , oral vasodilator , diuretic , digoxin , oxygen calcium channel blocker ( exception anticoagulant ) . 8 . Has ongoing hemorrhagic condition ( e.g. , upper digestive tract hemorrhage , hemoptysis , etc . ) , pre exist condition , Investigator 's judgment , may increase risk develop hemorrhage study ( e.g. , hemophilia ) . Transient hemorrhage ( e.g. , epistaxis , normal menstrual bleeding , gingival bleeding , hemorrhoidal bleeding , etc . ) preclude enrollment 9 . Has receive investigational medication , device therapy within 30 day prior Baseline visit schedule receive another investigational drug , device therapy course study . 10 . Has preexist disease know cause pulmonary hypertension list Inclusion Criteria . 11 . Has musculoskeletal disease disease would significantly limit ambulation . 12 . Has form unrepaired recently repair ( &lt; 5 year ) congenital systemictopulmonary shunt patent foramen ovale . 13 . Documented history current evidence ischemic heart disease . 14 . History leave sided myocardial disease evidence mean PCWP ( leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ) &gt; 15 mmHg leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % assess either multigated angiogram , angiography echocardiography , leave ventricular shorten fraction &lt; 22 % assessed echocardiography . Note subject abnormal leave ventricular function attribute entirely impaired leave ventricular filling due effect right ventricular overload ( i.e. , right ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation ) exclude . 15 .
