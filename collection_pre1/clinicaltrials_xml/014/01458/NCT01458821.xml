	<detailed_description>The objective pilot research project advance knowledge role attention , control , cortical network development maintenance bothersome tinnitus . The investigator three specific aim . First , determine whether Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus affect tinnitus percept aid recovery cognitive function apparently `` highjack '' tinnitus . Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus develop improve cognitive function engage brain 's neuroplasticity ; program novel , non-invasive , inexpensive . Second , establish specific default mode , attention system , cognitive control network deficit patient bothersome tinnitus use advance neuroimaging technique . Third , ass whether exposure Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus impact change default mode , attention system , cognitive control network deficit . The investigator employ randomize clinical trial design among cohort active-duty firefighter experience bothersome tinnitus . A planned enrollment 40 firefighter tinnitus clinical trial sufficient statistical power detect 17-point change Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score . In addition , previously develop fcMRI protocol use study brain activity region associate voluntary , involuntary , executive control attention 60 firefighter ( 40 firefighter enrol clinical trial 20 firefighter without tinnitus ) .</detailed_description>
