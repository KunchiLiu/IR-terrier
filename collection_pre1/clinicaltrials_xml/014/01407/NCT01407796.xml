	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research gain understanding basic response lung inflammation . Inflammation way body react irritation injury , involve red , warm , often painful swell affected tissue . `` Acute lung injury '' involve generalize inflammation lung activate several condition : infection , trauma , inhalation toxic substance , etc . When lung injury severe , enough oxygen get body ; lead need mechanical support breathing ( mechanical ventilation ) , problem brain , heart organ function , case , death . Inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) contribute development lung inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Endotoxin-induced iNOS Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan use [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS ( F stand fluorine NOS stand Nitric Oxide Synthase , name investigational radioactive drug target iNOS ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging measure lung inflammation . PET machine detect radiation generates picture use donut shape scanner similar appearance x-ray `` CAT '' scan . In order show [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS-PET related amount inflammation , investigator first need create state control lung inflammation measure quantified . `` Controlled lung inflammation '' mean reaction lung similar occurs lung infection ( increased respiratory secretion , cough ) . It `` controlled '' investigator use anything alive contagious ( spread one part body another , spread another person ) small area one lung affect . In order create state control lung inflammation , investigator plan put small amount endotoxin single small section lung use bronchoscope ( long , flexible , narrow tube pass nose mouth airway lung ) . This use endotoxin consider investigational . The investigator receive permission FDA use endotoxin research study .</detailed_description>
