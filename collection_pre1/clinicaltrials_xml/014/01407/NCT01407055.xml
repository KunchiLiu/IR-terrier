	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) extremely invasive medical intervention.It postulate even condition , treatment outcome substantially determine non-specific effect , e.g . patient 's expectation . Targeting patient ' expectation early stage might potential optimize outcome cardiac surgery . The purpose research project optimize patient ' outcome expectation undergo cardiac surgery brief psycho-educational program . Using randomize controlled design , 180 patient schedule undergo elective CABG randomly assign either standard medical information alone , additional expectation manipulation intervention ( EMI ) two week surgery , attention-control group ( `` supportive therapy '' ) . The main goal enhance positive expectation ( surgery 'non-specific effect ' ) favorable outcome EMI , cop ability deal adverse event , reduce negative expectation misconception . Assessment take place EMI , 10 day surgery 6 month later ; assessment point use 2 control condition . Primary outcome disability , show strongly determine patient 's expectation previous study . Moreover , psychological biological predictor mediator treatment success analyze . A positive result expectation intervention would major implication clinical practice . In order optimize treatment outcome , necessary improve treatment-specific procedure ( e.g. , cardiac surgery ) also address non-specific factor patient ' expectation .</detailed_description>
