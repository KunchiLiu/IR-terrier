	<brief_summary>This study aim determine different way perform prostate cancer surgery affect patient outcome , recurrence cancer regain control bladder function ( continence ) surgery . Surgery remove prostate know `` radical prostatectomy '' . Surgeons know many thing best way radical prostatectomy . However , uncertainty method surgery . All surgeon take part study use technique different time . However , unsure best approach . This trial evaluate whether follow two aspect surgical technique influence outcome : Lymph node template . Prostate cancer sometimes spread lymph node near prostate . Surgeons often remove lymph node make sure cancer leave body . However , uncertainty lymph node remove ( `` template '' ) . In particular , surgeon think important remove large number lymph node . Some believe prostate cancer find lymph nodes aggressive . As result , surgeon feel remove additional lymph node improve chance patient cure . In study patient either standard lymph node dissection modify approach . Port site incision . Some surgery conduct help call surgical `` robot '' , use laparoscopic approach ( sometimes know `` keyhole '' surgery ) . The surgeon make small cut ( `` incision '' ) order insert surgical instrument . Some surgeon believe way cut make affect chance patient develop hernia month surgery . This tissue abdomen protrude incision , create small bulge surgically correct . In study , patient either incision make vertically horizontally . Antibiotics . About week surgery , return hospital catheter remove . To guard chance infection , give antibiotic . These help prevent infection , also harmful . Doctors unsure whether give short course antibiotic whether patient really need several day treatment . In study , patient receive antibiotic either one three day .</brief_summary>
