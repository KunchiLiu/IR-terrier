	<brief_title>Nasogastric/Oral Gastric Tube Placement Infants : Comparing 2 Measurement Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infant often require nutritional intake nasogastric oral gastric tube meet high energy requirement avoid aspiration nutrition due immature suck/swallow reflex . When provide nutrition via NG OG tube , two basic safety issue ; accurate placement , determine end tube reach mid abdominal area , verification method assure placement optimal . Based review relevant literature , potentially accurate method tube placement available method use current practice . We hypothesize graph method result accurate less variable placement NG tube mid-stomach preterm infant current standard use NEM method .</detailed_description>
