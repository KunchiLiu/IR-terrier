	<brief_summary>The primary aim study increase understand care-seeking behavior surround heart attack acute coronary syndrome [ ACS ] . This study use internet base survey ask individual obtain medical care midst heart attack . At present , care-seeking delay among individual stricken heart attack prevents obtain full therapeutic benefit hospital base medical care timely manner reduce long term health consequence heart attack . By use self-tailoring survey instrument study attempt take consideration complex social process individual family make decision seek medical care symptom heart attack .

	<brief_title>Acute Coronary Syndrome Care-Seeking Delay : A Web Based Behavioral Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study increase understand care-seeking behavior surround acute coronary syndrome [ ACS ] application test integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ ISCM ] utilization world wide web [ WWW ] base ISCM survey instrument . At present , care-seeking delay among individual stricken ACS [ acute myocardial infarction [ AMI ] , unstable angina sudden cardiac death ] prevents many patient obtain full therapeutic benefit hospital base thrombolytic and/or mechanical reperfusion therapy reduce morbid mortal consequence acute cardiovascular disease [ CVD ] . Results prior study ACS care-seeking delay generally rely measure time duration acute symptom onset [ ASO ] hospital emergency department [ ED ] arrival measure social demographic clinical variable , extract emergency medical system [ EMS ] log and/or ED chart . By rely limited data source , study fail take consideration complexity social behavioral process individual make decision seek medical care symptom ACS . By apply test integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ ISCM ] ACS care-seeking , possible delineate decision point situation circumstance critical produce patterns care-seeking efficient expeditious protract delay . The care-seeking process ISCM view term five analytic care-seeking phase warn premonitory symptom ED arrival . By note presence absence three central phase , possible distinguish pattern care-seeking record duration care-seeking phase total duration care-seeking path ED . The ISCM assume cop behavior emerge time initially care-seeking behavior guide demographic structural factor . As self-regulatory coping process emerge course ACS episode , influence factor diminish emergent ACS evaluation , advice others health care provider , emerge symptom emotion , come dominate care-seeking process directly determine duration ACS care-seeking . The study test explore follow hypothesis : 1 . Commonly use demographic variable , , age , sex , education race prove one component , along social situational circumstantial , cognitive emotional variable , significantly influence course duration ACS care-seeking . 2 . The ISCM show decision process variable associate care-seeking phase , Self , Lay Health Care Provider Phases , show Figure , important predictor time symptom onset ED arrival prediction length time spend care-seeking phase . 3 . The ISCM show difference total duration 5 frequently occur care-seeking path ED explain difference variables Hypotheses 1 2 . 4 . Conditional model subject use key care-seeking phase , namely Self , Lay Health Care Provider Phases , identify unique predictor time phase . 5 . Significant interaction effect [ model coefficient difference ] find important risk variable socially important gender , age racial group . For example , African-Americans show difference model coefficient Non-African-Americans . The propose study utilizes twice test pilot ISCM survey instrument place two secure dedicate web server collect patient care-seeking data . The target sample size study 2,314 patient experienced ACS episode . Subjects recruit use : 1 ] extensive marketing study URL websites interest cardiac patient orient toward cardiac health ACS risk , , diabetes hypertension ; 2 ] placement study information discussion board chat room cardiac health focus ; 3 ] email study flyer PDF post public library , senior citizen center , African-American church , county municipal health clinic , HMO web site ; 4 ] application viral marketing strategy ; 5 ] use select print medium , example , AARP publication . Marketing study site URL emphasize recruitment woman , elderly minority . In data collection phase study , proportion myocardial infarction angina pectoris subject fall cell cross classification age , sex race derive NHANES 1999-2000 2001-2002 study . These estimate population proportion cell use determine quota cell attempt ensure risk group adequately represent . We sample African-Americans . Statistical model use estimate effect variable characterize decision process time delay ED arrival . Time require move one phase decision process next also model , different path choose subject . Models also include patient characteristic circumstantial situational variable decision process .</detailed_description>
