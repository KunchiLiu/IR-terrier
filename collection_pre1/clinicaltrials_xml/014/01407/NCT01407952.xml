	<brief_summary>This research study do test effectiveness new generation FDA approve device treat aneurysm compare current standard device endovascular aneurysm treatment bare platinum coil . Endovascular procedure form minimally invasive surgery , perform blood vessel . The technique involve introduction catheter long , thin , flexible , hollow plastic tube skin large blood vessel . Typically chosen blood vessel femoral artery find near groin . The catheter maneuver body location aneurysm brain use image guidance . Coils deliver aneurysm catheter . Once coils deliver aneurysm , detach catheter . This repeat enough coil fill aneurysm , block blood flow aneurysm . The body respond form blood clot around coil ( ) , help block flow blood aneurysm keep vessel rupture leak . This study compare study device standard bare platinum coil see good prevent future rupture leaking . The study device call HydroCoil Embolization System study post-market clinical trial . About 600 subject multiple institution take part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Your part study last 24 month involve 6 visit ( 1 baseline visit surgery , surgical procedure 4 follow-up visit ) . These visit occur time visit would receive standard care surgery . If study , place one two study group chance use process similar flip coin . This process call randomization . Neither study staff select group . One group , control group , aneurysm treat bare platinum coil endovascular procedure . The group , study group receive coil HydroCoil Embolization System . Both group receive standard care follow-up , surgery different type coil use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Candidates study must meet follow criterion enrol study : 1 . Patient 18 75 year age ( inclusive ) . 2 . Patient document untreated intracranial saccular aneurysm 314 mm diameter angiographic lumen , rupture unruptured , suitable embolization coil . 3 . Patients present HUNT HESS Grade 03 improve grade treatment 4 . Any type bare platinum coil HydroCoil 速 Coils treatment option ( shape allow ) . 5 . Patient next kin person appropriate power attorney provide write informed consent . 6 . Patient willing available study followup visit 7 . Patient previously enter Study Candidates ineligible enrollment study follow condition apply : 1 . Inability obtain informed consent 2 . Patient &lt; 18 &gt; 75 year old 3 . Target aneurysm saccular nature ( mycotic , fusiform , dissect ) . 4 . Target aneurysm &gt; 14 mm maximum luminal dimension , &lt; 3 mm maximum luminal dimension 5 . Target aneurysm previously clip coil 6 . Target aneurysm physician 's estimate unlikely successfully treat endovascular technique . 7 . Patient known hypersensitivity platinum , nickel , stainless steel structurally related compound find HydroCoil速 , HydroSoft速 , HydroFrame速 Coils and/or bare platinum coil . 8 . Baseline Hunt Hess scale 4 5 rupture aneurysms 9 . Intended use flow divert stent ( e.g . pipeline ) 10 . Subject concurrent intracranial pathology , e.g . Moyamoya Vasculitis document biopsy result AVMs AV fistulas Significant atherosclerotic disease ( i.e . symptomatic &gt; 50 % narrowing parent artery necessary traverse order coil target aneurysm ) Intracranial Hematoma ( unrelated target aneurysm ) Brain tumor Vascular tortuosity condition prevent access target aneurysm 11 . Subject serious comorbidities could confound study result : Uncontrolled hypertension Uncorrectable coagulation abnormality Contraindications heparin , aspirin clopidogrel Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Organ failure kidney , liver , heart , lung Myocardial infarction within past 6 month Cancer likely cause death within 2 year less . 12 . Subject history indicate high risk noncompliance ( e.g. , substance abuse , psychosocial issue , etc . ) 13 . Subject known history contraindicate contrast dye iodine premedicated prior coil procedure ( vs. sensitivity safely control antihistamine , steroid , etc. ) . Medical clearance need issue . 14 . Patients unable complete schedule follow assessment enrol center due limited life expectancy ( &lt; 2 year ) , comorbidities geographical consideration 15 . Subject currently breast feeding , pregnant plan become pregnant next 2 year . 16 . Major surgical procedure trauma within 30 day prior randomization 17 . The patient currently enrol another clinical study ( device drug ) . 18 . More one aneurysm need treatment time .</criteria>
