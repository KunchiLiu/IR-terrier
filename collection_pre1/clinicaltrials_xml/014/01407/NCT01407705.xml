	<brief_title>High-Resolution Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) Cervical Spinal Cord Setting Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) result trauma well degenerative condition , cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ) . Both profound impact physical mental health affect individual . The symptom CSM include weakness arm legs , difficulty walk balance , loss dexterity hand , bowel bladder dysfunction . Traumatic spinal cord injury often include damage white matter tract result irreversible functional deficit paraplegia quadriplegia . Although current diagnostic imaging reveal highly specific parameter spinal canal anatomy , functional anatomy spinal cord remain unknown . Patients similar diagnostic finding vary clinically many patient minimal symptom others may severely incapacitate . Conventional MRI method , T1/T2 weight MRI , may easily identify region damage may depict permanent change spinal cord tissue . However , conventional MRI method limit ability correlate imaging finding short long term functional outcome spinal cord injury . DTI potential improve upon conventional MRI image provide information tissue microstructure may particularly well suit assess integrity fiber tract SCI . Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DTI ) new technique highly sensitive detect integrity white matter tract . Although information obtain DTI utilized white matter abnormality brain , DTI spinal cord vivo provide many challenge . The small size spinal cord close pack white matter tract require high image resolution visualize individual tract . The resolution require image small cross sectional area spinal cord difficult achieve use widely use DTI sequence . To date , DTI measurement report demonstrate practical application DTI cervical spinal cord limit spatial resolution 8 mm3 16 mm3 . To achieve high-resolution DTI spinal cord , two novel image technique high-resolution in-vivo DTI clinical 3T MRI system ( Trio , Siemens Medical Solution , Erlangen Germany ) develop : 2D singleshot Interleaved Multiple Inner Volume DWEPI ( ss-IMIV-DWEPI ) 3D singleshot DW STimulated EPI ( 3D ss-DWSTEPI ) . These optimized DTI pulse sequence typically achieve approximately 2.0 1.253 mm3 spatial resolution within clinically achievable imaging time ( ~5 min. ) . The sequence design especially high-resolution DTI cervical spinal cord . They apply spinal cord specimens ex vivo well small group healthy volunteer multiple sclerosis patient .</detailed_description>
