	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : One couple 6 consults infertility sexual life . In 60 % case male factor associate main infertility factor . Inflammatory Syndrome ( IS ) , characterize presence leukocytospermia find 12 % case . Leukocyte degranulation cause oxidative stress ( OS ) formation free radical attack sperm cell function . HYPOTHESIS : To establish responsibility IS , OS , chronicle inflammatory male infertility , investigator hypothesize treatment ( well possible cause ) must restore improve fertilize capacity patient sperm . METHODS : This prospective randomized study test response treatment . The investigator shall measure cellular degradation product due OS , thereby certify deleterious effect sperm cell . Seminal biochemistry also assess impact syndrome genital tract gland follow evolution . The patient include study soon leukocytospermia &gt; 0,5*106/ml soon elastase &gt; 500 ng/mL . The examination perform use flow cytometry , CASA ( Computer Assisted Semen Analysis ) . The analysis sperm morphology centralize . Primary endpoint reduction percentage 8OH-dG 35 % . We anticipate arrive 20 % patient include arm treatment corticosteroid therapy . All thus need 50 patient group placebo 50 group treat . Secondary endpoint improvement spermatic parameter reduction fragmentation DNA sperm cell treated subject . All biological marker evaluate 6 month treatment : - Fragmentation spermatic DNA 37 % follow-up 6 month - Leukocytospermia elastase - Seminal biochemistry - Other marker inflammatory syndrome oxidative stress ( protein carbonyl , 8OHd-Guanosine ) - Possibly radiological examination ( Ultrasound MRI genital tract ) In addition would allow u propose policy prevention towards acquire post-infectious male infertility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Progress research . Timeframe Search - Duration inclusion : 30 month - Duration patient follow-up : 7 month - Total duration study : 37 month Within framework coverage AMP , barren couple consultation doctor reproduction one biologist . Between two visit , spermatic balance assessment ( EXAMINATION N°0 ) make include semen culture , spermogram test migration survival ( TMS ) elastase . On occasion examination , aliquots measure 8OH-dG , fragmentation spermatic DNA seminal biochemistry systematically take . Within framework standard balance assessment infertility , possible echography MRI genital way prescribe ; case , data examination collect case report form . But examination specifically ask search . If leukocytospermia ≥ 0,5*106/ml discovered increase elastase ≥ 500 ng / ml , dosages 8OH-dG , fragmentation seminal biochemistry make . The patient see consultation biology ( CONSULTATION OF BIOLOGY N°0 = visit inclusion randomization ) . - If patient present 8OH-dG &gt; 35 % , semen culture negative , suggest include protocol randomization make day ; patient receive anti-inflammatory treatment ( Prednisone ) treatment placebo . - If 8OH-dG &lt; 35 % suggest participate study follow-up spontaneous evolution SO SI 6 month . A first complete balance assessment make 1 month ( EXAMINATION N°1 ) begin treatment study ( Prednisone placebo ) estimate evolution end treatment inflammatory oxidative parameter This balance assessment realize inclusive randomize patient 's . Patients randomize study laboratory test include : - A semen analysis ( leukocytospermia ) - A measure oxidative stress ( 8OHd guanosine assay - assay protein carbonyl - DNA fragmentation ) - A seminal biochemistry ( acid 1-4 ) alpha phosphatase , citrate , zinc , fructose , carnitine glucosidase A second balance assessment ask 6 month ( EXAMINATION N°2 ) begin treatment two reason : first reason improvement spermatic parameter slowly make . If spermatic change settle year go disappear fortnight . It effectively experience . Besides spermatogenesis continue three month , new cycle production sperm cell estimate three month treatment . The second reason second offenses chronic inflammation reproductive organ extremely frequent estimate rate second offense balance assessment remotely ask treatment 6 month . This review include test initial assessment : - A semen analysis ( leukocytospermia ) - A measure oxidative stress ( 8OHd guanosine assay - assay protein carbonyl - DNA fragmentation ) - A seminal biochemistry ( acid 1-4 ) alpha phosphatase , citrate , zinc , fructose , carnitine glucosidase - An ultrasound genital tract genital tract RMI without injection compound This visit schedule patient , whether randomize . During visit , result test carry 1 month 6 month initiation treatment analyze . The investigator collect adverse event occur since randomization visit . Patients examination 6 month significant improvement semen parameter propose cryopreserving sperm . Assays analysis semen Collections semen do Laboratory Reproductive Biology participate centre research . Most assays analysis centralize Cochin Hospital . Measurement elastase Elastase assay centralize Laboratory Reproductive Biology , Hospital Cochin . The assay carry 150 µl total sperm collect liquefaction frozen -20 ° C. Migration Survival Test ( MST ) This test do locally participate centre . A smear slide make centralized analysis morphology , avoid `` centre '' effect . Seminal Biochemistry The biochemical seminal centralize Laboratory Biochemistry , Hospital Cochin . This assay , carry total sperm collect liquefaction , include assay acid phosphatase , citrate , zinc , fructose , carnitine 1-4.alpha Glucosidase The semen collect , centrifuge 600g 5 minute . After centrifugation , 500μl supernatant frozen - 20 ° C use biochemical seminal . Measurement oxidative stress The extent oxidative stress centrally assess Cochin Hospital . This assay , carry total sperm collect liquefaction , include determination 8OHd-Guanosine , dosage protein carbonyl DNA fragmentation . The semen collect centrifuge 600g 5 minute . After centrifugation : - 250μl supernatant frozen - 20 ° C use determination protein carbonyl . - The pellet use assay 8OHdguanosine DNA fragmentation . Measurement sperm motion parameter CASA The measurement sperm motion parameter CASA perform locally participate centre . Ultrasound MRI genital tract Ultrasounds MRI perform genital tract central radiology department hospital Necker . Conservation remain sample semen For patient significant improvement semen parameter examination 6 month , offer self-preservation semen subsequent attempt ART end study . On hand , remain sample semen , except opposition patient , keep end research later use future research fertility inflammation . This collection keep CECOS - Cochin Hospital , Bldg . Cassini - 27 rue du FAUBOURG St Jacques , 75014 Paris supervision Professor Jean-PHILIPPE Wolf . Stopping rule Patients may discontinue participation research wish , time whatever reason , upon decision investigator . However , treatment stop suddenly . Stopping rule participation person seek - Poor adherence protocol - intercurrent disease inclusion visit visit 1 month require cessation study . Following study surveillance . Procedures monitor output test All output test document investigator must specify reason . For patient consider lost sight , case report form fill last visit . The investigator make every effort contact patient know reason leave trial health . Consequences Patients quit trial re-included study . Their number effectively reuse . These patient still follow non-randomized part study .</detailed_description>
