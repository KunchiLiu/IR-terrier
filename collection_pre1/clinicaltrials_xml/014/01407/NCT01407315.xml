	<detailed_description>This monocenter single-arm , prospective clinical study 20 type 1 diabetic subject , equip GlucoMen®Day system . Each subject investigate 100 hour implantation microdialysis probe . In order verify clinical effectiveness GlucoMenDay subject ask perform total six self test measurement per day use GlucoCard G-Meter accord follow scheme : - breakfast - lunch - 60-120 minute lunch - dinner - 60-120 minute dinner - 3 AM Subjects ask come research facility every day obtain venous blood sample check system function . Subjects randomize either Procedure A - Multiple sampling Procedure B - Meal/Insulin test . Procedure A - Multiple sampling : This procedure perform day 2-4 study period . Subjects receive standardize lunch ( 100 g CHO ) , administration insulin perform subject base insulin carbohydrate ratio . An intravenous catheter insert one forearm venous sample start 1 hour lunch ingestion . Arterialized-venous blood sampling perform every 15 minute period two hour . Samples analyze glucose use Super GL ; concomitantly capillary measurement use GlucoCard G Meter perform . Procedure B - Meal/Insulin test : This procedure perform day 2 four experiment . Subjects randomized procedure B ask undergo investigation twice . Subjects receive standard breakfast ( 75g CHO ) , usual morning insulin dose post-poned . An increase dose rapid-acting insulin analogue aim produce minor hypoglycaemia base insulin carbohydrate ratio inject subcutaneously . Arterialized-venous sampling perform every 10 minute period two hour . Samples analyze glucose use Super GL ; concomitantly , capillary measurement use GlucoCard G Meter perform . On day 5 subject return clinical trial unit collection final blood sample removal device . Subjects ask come research facility 48 72 hour removal device evaluation local site reaction .</detailed_description>
