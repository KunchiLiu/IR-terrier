	<brief_title>A Study Omarigliptin ( MK-3102 ) Participants With Impaired Renal Function ( MK-3102-009 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part I , three panel 6 participant enrol vary degree renal disease ( mild , moderate , severe renal impairment ) base estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . Each panel match corresponding panel equal number healthy , age- , race- , BMI- gender-matched control participant . All panel receive single oral dose 3-mg omarigliptin , follow plasma sample urine collection . In Part II , 6 participant end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require hemodialysis receive single 3-mg oral dose omarigliptin immediately follow hemodialysis ( HD ) ( Period 1 ) 2 hour prior HD ( Period 2 ) .There approximately 1 month Period 1 Period 2 . A corresponding panel equal number , healthy match control subject ( age , race , BMI , gender ) also receive single 3 mg dose mouth . Omarigliptin dose administration follow plasma sampling panel .</detailed_description>
