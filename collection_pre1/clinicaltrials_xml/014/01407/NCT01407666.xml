	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize study intend assess efficacy safety bilateral continuous paravertebral block compare continuous epidural block open liver resection . Hypotheses : Bilateral paravertebral block : 1 ) equally effective control perioperative pain ; 2 ) safe , less frequent complication follow open liver resection compare continuous epidural block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Epidural Bilateral Paravertebral Blocks Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A number study evaluate unilateral continuous paravertebral block demonstrate equal superior analgesia compare epidural analgesia postoperative pain control ( 1-7 ) . At time , study show decreased incidence side effect complication , include : hypotension , pulmonary complication , urinary retention , nausea vomit fail block . Several study also indicate bilateral paravertebral block provide adequate postoperative analgesia ( 8-14 ) . However , study perform date show direct comparison epidural bilateral paravertebral block patient undergo open liver resection.Objectives : This prospective , randomize study intend assess efficacy safety bilateral continuous paravertebral block compare continuous epidural block open liver resection . Hypotheses : Bilateral paravertebral block : 1 ) equally effective control perioperative pain ; 2 ) safe , less frequent complication follow open liver resection compare continuous epidural block.Methods : A hundred adult patient undergo elective open liver resection randomize receive continuous epidural block continuous bilateral paravertebral block perioperative analgesia . The primary outcome degree pain control measure visual analog scale 24 hour post surgery ( rest patient perform maximum incentive spirometry ) . The secondary outcome include : 1 ) Assessment pain ( rest , cough , ambulation ) use verbal numerical pain scale perform postoperatively every 8 hour floor nursing staff discharge . During night patient awaken pain assessment . 2 ) Intravenous opioid requirement : In addition pain score , postoperative intravenous opioid requirement [ hydromorphone ( mg ) ] also record daily ; Frequency side effect complication ; functional status ( volume maximum incentive spirometry , time extubation , total time initial ambulation , length hospital stay , time return bowel function , readiness discharge hospital , length hospital stay ) . At one month post surgery , health-related quality life , mortality , morbidity assess . Each variable compare paravertebral group epidural group examine hypotheses . Clinical Implications : Bilateral continuous paravertebral block could equally effective safe alternative continuous epidural block perioperative pain management patient undergo open liver resection .</detailed_description>
