	<brief_summary>Many people spinal cord injury ( SCI ) hold ability move leg muscle , therefore consider demonstrate motor incomplete injury . After spinal cord injury , individual able walk le home community . De-conditioning , lack endurance fitness also occur . Several method available try improve walk ability fitness person motor incomplete spinal cord injury . This study examine two method . The first use robotically assist body-weight supported walk use device call Lokomat . The second aquatic pool-based exercise . The investigator research impact two technique walk ability fitness people experience motor incomplete spinal cord injury least 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Lokomat Aquatic Exercise Individuals With Chronic Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research occur two center Kernan Orthopedics Rehabilitation Hospital Baltimore , Maryland Shepherd Center Atlanta , Georgia . A total 36 volunteer three year period need . In order qualify study , individual must 18 65 year old motor incomplete SCI . The level injury range fourth cervical level neck twelfth thoracic level back . Potential volunteer must able tolerate stand stand frame least 30 minute . Individuals assess physician determine eligibility study participate type exercise would safe . Participants must able understand study requirement sign inform consent document . Participants need commit total seven month . Included time : testing , 3 month exercise , test , 2 week break , second 3 month exercise , final testing . Half group start Lokomat training half start wtih aquatic exercise . Each group switch exercise condition . Exercise session occur three time per week last approximately 45-55 minute . A physical therapist provide personal direction exercise group . Walking ability cardiovascular fitness , well muscle strength assess start exercise , three-month point six month point . It hop type exercise therapy help individual motor incomplete spinal injury walk good experience well heart-lung fitness endurance . The risk associate type study similar type cardiovascular exercise . In addition , individual spinal cord injury may present medical condition , may risk study . The physicians therapist involve research discus risk detail individual enroll . This type research important good understand best prescribe exercise treatment people spinal injury . This especially true regard aquatic therapy , since little scientific data effect group individual . The rigorous assessment aquatic exercise , already available many community , may expand fitness opportunity individual incomplete spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
