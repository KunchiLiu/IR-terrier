	<brief_summary>The study drug , Nilotinib , believe slow tumor growth regulate gene involve cellular growth chordoma cell . During research study , subject also receive radiation therapy consider standard treatment advance chordomas . It hop add nilotinib , benefit radiation therapy enhance without add significant toxicity . The purpose research study determine safety nilotinib use combination radiation therapy , high dose nilotinib give safely radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
