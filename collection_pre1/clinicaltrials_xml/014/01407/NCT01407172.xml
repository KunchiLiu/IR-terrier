	<brief_summary>This observational study compare plasma level free hydrogen sulfide patient without peripheral arterial disease use novel recently publish method measure hydrogen sulfide . The investigator also see difference level symptomatic asymptomatic patient . Will examine relationship level know clinical risk factor well plasma nitrite nitric oxide level . In investigator hope explore utility free hydrogen sulfide biomarker peripheral arterial disease . Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) low extremity represent significant grow cause morbidity mortality . The PARTNERS study screen ABIs primary care population nearly 7000 individual demonstrate remarkable 29 % incidence ABI &lt; 0.9 , commonly accept level abnormal ABI diagnostic PAD . Also note patient new diagnosis PAD incidence asymptomatic PAD strike 48 % . The availability biomarker greatly enhance care patient hopefully reduce morbidity mortality . The investigator believe hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , endogenously produce gasotransmitter , hold promise clinically useful biomarker PAD may also provide possible explanation paradox asymptomatic PAD patient ABIs less 0.9 . To date , research regard H2S demonstrate participates myriad physiological function include vasodilatation , anti-apoptotic effect , modulation mitochondrial respiration , change vascular remodeling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct observational cohort study evaluate H2S level three group patient : 1 . Patients without PAD define ABI &gt; 0.9 &lt; 1.3 . 2 . Patients asymptomatic PAD define ABI &lt; 0.9 symptom 3 . Patient symptomatic PAD define presence typical atypical claudication symptom critical limb ischemia conjunction ABI &lt; 0.9 . This single center study perform LSUHSC-Shreveport . Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization peripheral angiogram via major arterial approach LSUHSC cardiac catheterization laboratory meeting inclusion exclusion criterion eligible give opportunity participate . Those provide informed consent interview presence claudication symptom , use San Diego Claudication Questionnaire presence know risk factor PAD . The medical record review collection baseline clinical data include know risk factor vascular disease well medication etc . Ankle Brachial Index measure standard technique non-invasive measurement bilateral arm ankle pressure record patient . Plasma free H2S level quantification via high performance liquid gas chromatography , well plasma nitrite level nitric oxide level chemiluminescence assay perform .</detailed_description>
