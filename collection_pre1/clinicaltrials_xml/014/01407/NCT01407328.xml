	<brief_title>The Effect Shoulder Arthroscopic Surgery Respiratory Mechanics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , shoulder surgery perform arthroscopy . The advantage shoulder arthroscopic surgery decrease blood loss due minimal incision scope , reduce operation time , minimization surgical stress , rapid recovery time surgery . During shoulder arthroscopic surgery , extravasation irrigation fluid occur around shoulder trachea , compress upper airway . Although extravasation generally reabsorb asymptomatically within 12 hour , case lead reintubation life-threatening complication . Furthermore , soft tissue edema around shoulder may extend thoracic cage , compress chest induce respiratory distress immediately surgery . From fact , mechanism respiratory discomfort shoulder arthroscopic surgery may upper airway obstruction restrictive pathology due direct compression thoracic cage soft tissue edema . There study respiratory effect shoulder arthroscopic surgery . We observe frequent severe respiratory discomfort shoulder arthroscopic surgery . Therefore , study attempt determine effect shoulder arthroscopic surgery respiratory mechanic . Changes respiratory mechanic arterial blood gas measure compare shoulder arthroscopic surgery .</detailed_description>
