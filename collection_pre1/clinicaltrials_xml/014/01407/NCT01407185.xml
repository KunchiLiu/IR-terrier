	<detailed_description>This study IRB approve Catholic Home Care New York Institute Technology due collaboration Catholic Home Care New York Institute Technology . Subjects volunteer , recruit initial therapy visit 10 trained CHC staff subsequently randomize base patient identification number experimental group experimental group consent obtain . Subjects sign consent form enter study . Two group 40 subject require finish order obtain power 80 alpha .05 . The subject live home reliable caregiver . The nurse provide current best practice CHF patient study include educate patient caregiver regard diet , medication regime , monitor sign symptom report provide coordination discipline social work depression require additional management OASIS screening . During initial physical therapy visit , usual care assessment perform , addition , obtain pre-test baseline data experimental control group . A preliminary home exercise program assign . A handout pace activity deep breathing give . The importance reason perceive exertion scale explain experimental group subject handout give part study packet . All subject encourage complete home aerobic portion minimum 2 time per day give activity log check enter number distance achieve walking exercise . Resistance exercise do least twice per week one day rest session . For control group subsequent session include usual home care physical therapy consist breathing exercise , therapeutic exercise , transfer , gait training , home exercise program . Baseline measurement ( field test ) complete initial evaluation discharge therapy . In addition , Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) , question re-hospitalizations , activity log , fall follow collect review 6 12 month program . Baseline measurement : The 2-Minute step test ( 2MST ) aerobic measure use old adults.17 The subject instruct raise knee joint point halfway patella iliac crest comfortable pace 2 minute . It score count number time right knee reach point describe 2 minute . Vital sign include BP , PR , RR , RPE , pulse ox , sign symptom decompensation monitor , test administration . The 2MST validate several measurement tool aerobic capacity/endurance . The MLHFQ self report outcome tool measure quality life ( QoL ) people CHF . The MLHFQ widely use QoL assessment tool . Although MLHFQ incorporate relevant aspect three dimension quality life , questionnaire design measure particular dimension separately . The total score take best measure heart failure treatment impact individual 's quality life.21 The MLHFQ differentiate New York Heart Association Functional group . The 30 second chair rise test ass low extremity strength endurance.20 , 23,24 Jones et al report moderately high correlation chair stand performance maximum weight-adjusted leg press performance men woman ( r=.78 .71 respectively ) support criterion-related validity chair stand test measure low extremity strength . Gait speed powerful tool predictive value . Cesari et al report gait speed le 1 m/sec identifies person high risk health-related outcome include mortality physical disability well-functioning old people.26 Montero-Odasso et al find gait speed also predictive adverse health-related outcome well-functioning elderly person recommend consider `` vital sign '' .27 Hardy et al report improvement gait speed predict substantial reduction mortality.28 Studenski et al report gait speed less .6 m/sec predictive future risk hospitalization decline health function.29 We use comfortable gait speed . Normative data provide comfortable gait speed fast gait speed Bohannon Lusardi et al..30 , 31 , 32 , 33 For experimental group , subsequent visit include monitor ital sign , activity log , progress aerobic resist exercise use elastic tubing . Aerobic exercise protocol ( perform subject 's home ) : The aerobic component study base tolerance subject base vital sign , Pulse Oximetry , RPE . These parameter reassess walk activity . Any subject responding appropriately continue day telephone call make MD follow CHC 's protocol physician notification base vital sign sign symptom . The subject use assistive device necessary . During therapy session focus pace improve deviation note . A distance baseline determine first visit . The home walk program do least twice day , preferably build hourly frequency , caregiver supervision assist necessary . The instruction patient walk slightly fatigue , preferably reach RPE 11-14 increase ambulation distance time . Resistance train protocol : All subject work 30-60 % 1 RM . In general , therapist provide necessary guidance insure postural base sound , good stabilization , substitution occur . All subject monitor vital sign program program need , base sign , symptom patient complaint decompensation . Intensity 1 . The therapist selects theraband produce muscle fatigue ~ 15 repetition . 2 . Have subject perform 1-2 repetition . Moving slow speed allow great control less chance injury . Tell patient able stop dime exercise . 3 . The subject report exercise somewhat light somewhat hard . 4 . If subject report less fairly light , increase resistance . 5 . If subject rate somewhat hard reduce resistance . 6 . Repeat desire RPE obtain . 7 . The exercise continue momentary fatigue evidence . Fatigue evidence note increase speed movement overcome resistance , follow inability complete repetition prompt slow . In case exercise complete . Also fatigue achieve exerciser unable complete rep prompt maintain good form . 8 . Fatigue therefore define inability move full ROM slow control fashion . Since achieve fatigue ; 1 set sufficient . 9 . Record exercise perform , amount resistance , # good quality rep perform fatigue reach . A single set do muscle group14 Progression 1 . If subject able complete 25+ repetition exercise prior session give muscle group , increase resistance 10 % 2 . If subject complete &lt; 25 rep keep resistance 3 . Repeat sequence subsequent session . Continue document amount resistance use number rep exercise . Duration : duration therapist supervised portion program shorter comparable study literature . However , frequency duration match current practice pattern home care . 1 . Allow frequent rest . 2 . Should longer 30 minute start . Frequency : week 1 2 frequency : 2-3x/week week week 3 subsequent week frequency 2x/week . It anticipate almost subject achieve functional goal finish PT home care 4 week . Subjects continue 2x per week upon discharge caregiver . The subject caregiver train RPE symptom monitoring decompensation . 3 . Moving slowly reduces need stretch . 4 . Explain subject physical activity may make feel soreness achiness , normal expect response exercise . 5 . It expect patient resistance exercise twice week rest day . Aerobic program do least 2 time day build hourly walk program . Follow : All participant receive telephone call physical therapist blind group assignment 6 12 month complete MLHFQ , take fall history , ask subsequent hospitalization . Activity log mail monthly . Participants receive postage pay envelope receive phone call reminder monthly prior require submission . Statistics : All statistical analysis do use SPSS 15 ( SPSS Inc. Chicago , IL. ) . Differences group change time baseline versus discharge assess use mixed design ANOVA . The independent variable intervention ( experimental vs. control ) time repeat independent variable across subject . The dependent variable : strength score , 2-minute step test , Minnesota , Gait speed , chair stand test . Appropriate post hoc test utilized event significant find order investigate pair wise effect . An alpha level p &lt; 0.05 use statistical comparison . Research Design : This study randomize , two group , experimental group ( combine aerobic resistance training ) control group ( usual care ) , pre-post test design measure effect home-based combined aerobic resistive training program subject 60-85 year age chronic heart failure . The subject evaluate baseline 4 week fall history , hospital re-admission history , endurance use 2MST , quality life use MLHFQ , strength use 30 second chair stand test , comfortable gait speed functional ability . The subject receive follow phone call fall , hospital re-admissions MLHFQ 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
