	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) common , often over-looked patient disease get medical treatment . Patients CKD special need medical treatment . When special need consider medical care may lead unintended harm ( call safety event ) cause hospitalization , kidney problem , even death . This research study two purpose . The first purpose determine participant feel wear medical alert bracelet necklace alert health care worker user bracelet necklace decrease kidney function . Medical alert bracelet often recommend people medical problem , diabetes . This medical alert bracelet necklace address informational website safe care patient kidney problem . The investigator think alert health care worker person decrease kidney function may decrease chance medical injury improve safety care . The second purpose research study track often people kidney problem may expose medicine , test , procedure might increase chance accidental medical injury safety event . Though medical injury prevent , investigator want find medical event patient kidney problem might preventable . The investigator also want find thing might increase patient 's chance get medical injury , physical weakness medical instruction might confuse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease require dialysis ( CKD ) common , under-recognized , among patient frequent health care system , improve patient safety high priority . Poor recognition disease several feature unique CKD make high-risk condition adverse , patient-safety incident ( PSIs ) . In context , PSIs refer event unintended harm injury relate medication medical care . These adverse safety event may include usually cite general population ( PSI ) , also , CKD-specific unsafe practice ( CKD-PSI ) , turn , lead frequent hospitalization , accelerate loss kidney function , increase risk end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , death - common outcome CKD . CKD-PSIs establish prior work investigator study help expert panel know commonly PSIs CKD-PSIs occur measure reliably CKD population . Furthermore , know role poor disease recognition play occurrence safety event . Finally , remain determined whether CKD-PSIs contribute high frequency adverse outcomes common disease . If CKD-PSIs common account significant portion adverse event common population , possible reduce incidence CKD-PSIs , increase disease recognition , outcomes improve patient population . In study , investigator enroll volunteer population pre-dialysis CKD purpose observe frequency CKD-PSI target population detect time . The participant assess annually event relate CKD-PSI . The first 100 participant ( Phase I ) provide standard medical alert accessory ( bracelet necklace ) commonly use alert doctor providers patient 's disease state . In case medical alert accessory state `` Decreased Kidney Function . For My Care , Please Visit ( website ) www.safekidneycare.org '' Participants ask log onto website use unique 4-digit identifier ( ID ) assign PI track participant 's use website improve website . Since information website available public , participant require use ID access content website . The website collect store patient health information , except Internet Protocol ( IP ) address provide limited information location computer use access website ( city , state , zip , area code ) . The volunteer Phase I track time whether use tolerate medical alert bracelet/necklace incidence CKD-PSI . Enrollment continue Phase I Phase II ( n = 250 ) participant track identical study schedule detection CKD-PSI . All study procedure Phase II except medical alert accessory . The overall goal study determine : frequency CKD-PSI target population , acceptability alert device ( Phase I ) intend increase recognition CKD , contribution CKD-PSI high incidence adverse outcome CKD</detailed_description>
