	<brief_summary>Recently , laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) placements frequently perform general anesthesia . The investigator occasionally encounter clinical situation perform internal jugular vein ( IJV ) cannulation LMA insertion , especially difficult airway subject undergo major surgery . However , anatomic relation IJV common carotid artery ( CCA ) patient LMA placement report different patient endotracheal tube . The degree overlap right IJV CCA LMA placement great LMA placement . Furthermore , many case complete overlap right IJV CCA LMA placement . Therefore , risk puncture CCA increase investigator try cannulate IJV LMA placement . Furthermore , central landmark commonly use IJV cannulation prove show low success rate LMA placement previous report . The investigator carefully examine anatomic relation IJV CCA LMA insertion ultrasonography , find degree overlap different accord degree head rotation . The investigator postulate degree overlap different accord degree head rotation LMA insertion , investigator find angle head rotation least overlap reduce risk CCA puncture . Therefore , investigator try ( 1 ) find optimal head rotation angle appropriate puncturing IJV LMA placement , ( 2 ) find suitable landmark adequate IJV cannulation LMA placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently , laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) placements frequently perform general anesthesia . The investigator occasionally encounter clinical situation perform internal jugular vein ( IJV ) cannulation LMA insertion , especially difficult airway subject undergo major surgery . However , anatomic relation IJV common carotid artery ( CCA ) patient LMA placement report different patient endotracheal tube . The degree overlap right IJV CCA LMA placement great LMA placement . Furthermore , many case complete overlap right IJV CCA LMA placement . Therefore , risk puncture CCA increase investigator try cannulate IJV LMA placement . Furthermore , central landmark commonly use IJV cannulation prove show low success rate LMA placement previous report . Previous study recommend low puncture point near area clavicular head sternocleidomastoid muscle attache clavicle , CCA observe vicinity IJV LMA insertion . Even though perform test puncture lower puncture point 20 patient found complication , low puncture point usual site IJV cannulation anesthesiologist . It know increase head rotation associate high probability CCA contact . The investigator carefully examine anatomic relation IJV CCA LMA insertion ultrasonography , find degree overlap different accord degree head rotation . The investigator postulate degree overlap different accord degree head rotation LMA insertion , investigator find angle head rotation least overlap reduce risk CCA puncture . Therefore , investigator try ( 1 ) find optimal head rotation angle appropriate puncturing IJV LMA placement , ( 2 ) find suitable landmark adequate IJV cannulation LMA placement .</detailed_description>
