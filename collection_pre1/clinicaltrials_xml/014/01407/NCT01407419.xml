	<brief_title>The CORRONA Treat Target Trial : Outcomes Feasibility US Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New exist CORRONA sit patient participant recruit participate subject 12 month trial examine outcome feasibility implement Treat Target approach RA disease management , require routine monthly monitoring regular escalation treatment subject achieve low disease activity ( LDA ) compare control group subject treat usual care . Purpose The primary purpose study determine whether practice implement multi-dimensional T2T process effectively control active Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) patient eligible-for-acceleration compare practice continue usual care . The trial also determine process treat target select subject different two group . A wide variety therapy use clinical practice treat patient RA . The CORRONA Data Collection Program design collect document utilization pattern , effectiveness , safety DMARDs ( Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs ) , biologic agent , many treatment currently use management rheumatic disease . It anticipate study data may help improve quality information upon clinical decision base . Objectives Co-primary Objectives 1 . To measure rate low disease activity ( CDAI score ) treatment arm ( T2T vs usual care ) 12 month . 1a . To assess implementation T2T Protocol compare rate acceleration , frequency visit , time next visit , probability acceleration conditional disease activity subject treat T2T intervention group , compare control group treat usual care ( UC ) 12 month . Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine mediator differences LDA rate two randomized group . 2 . To determine association process treat target LDA ( regardless randomization ) . 3 . To determine proportion subject active RA moderate high disease activity CDAI eligible acceleration Baseline achieve low disease activity ( LDA ) CDAI 6 month subject treat T2T intervention group compare control group treat usual care ( UC ) , baseline disease activity . 4 . To compare performance derive outcome metric T2T intervention usual care 6 12 month , include : 1 . DAS28 ESR 2 . Patient Reported Outcomes- RAPID 3 5 . To determine frequency ineligibility treatment acceleration due risk , comorbidities , concomitant medication clinician judgment potential T2T study enrollee . 6 . To compare rate drug toxicity T2T UC group 12 month . 7 . To compare rate Targeted Adverse Events ( TAEs ) T2T intervention UC arm . Exploratory Objectives To determine rate reason non-acceleration subject qualify CDAIs , enrol T2T UC arm . Subjects moderate severe Rheumatoid Arthritis disease activity ( define CDAI score &gt; 10 ) enrol trial participate site . Sites randomized either Treat Target Usual Care arm . Visits include Baseline , Month 3 , 6,9 , 12 visit subject . In addition , subject enrol site participate Treat Target Arm achieve low disease activity ( CDAI â‰¤10 ) expect return Monthly Assessment visit . Treatment acceleration expect occur frequently monthly least every 3 month subject , unless contraindicate . Treatment acceleration purpose trial include follow option : Initiation Change prescribe treatment dosage `` traditional '' `` biologic '' Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs ( DMARDs ) change route Methotrexate administration ( oral subcutaneous ) Upon enrollment , physicians subject complete Enrollment Questionnaires , include 28 joint assessment . Targeted Adverse Event Reporting Qualifying adverse event occur participation study report Targeted Adverse Event ( TAE ) Questionnaires . TAE Questionnaires complete submit flagged event Physician Follow-up Questionnaire select . Submission de-identified source document ( i.e . hospital record , laboratory result , etc . ) support report TAE require order valid , unless otherwise determine CORRONA Organization . The TAE simultaneously report TAE Questionnaire CORRONA Data Collection Program Physician Follow-up Questionnaire visit date closely follow event ( unless TAE occur date Follow-up Visit ) . In addition , site encourage forward CORRONA , Inc.de-identified report qualify Serious Adverse Events within 24 hr learn use CORRONA SAE report form . Data submit inclusion Database include name , address , telephone number , email address , social security number subject . Data Questionnaires track CORRONA Database unique CORRONA identifier assign physician 's office . A link maintain physician 's office patient-identifying information ( e.g. , name , address , telephone number ) unique CORRONA identifier . The physician 's office share information CORRONA need match subject name unique CORRONA identifier . Site Enrollment : Selected rheumatologist invite participate investigator Treat Target study.Not rheumatologist involve CORRONA Data Collection Program involve study . Physicians select carefully identify site appropriate qualification infrastructure support trial comply applicable regulation Good Clinical Practices protect right human subject . All potential site screen clinical research experience GCP ( Good Clinical Practice ) training . Investigators must obtain Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval . Private physician office affiliate academic institution may submit New England IRB ( NEIRB ) . Sites academic center submit local institutional IRBs use approve template guideline submission , NEIRB approve institutional IRB . Subject Informed Consent Informed consent obtain investigator and/or designee ( ) . Informed consent obtain office setting , accordance FDA regulation guideline prior commencement study-specific related activity . Patient participation voluntary , participant may withdraw consent time . The CORRONA Organization conduct systematic review submit record . Additionally , sit participate Treat Target trial expect least one on-site monitoring visit course trial . This frequency may adjust , need , address data quality issue .</detailed_description>
