The study design identify moderator mediator treatment response depression order specify biosignature treatment response depression . Evaluation usefulness marker carefully conduct clinical trial compare antidepressant placebo assist develop Depression Treatment Response Index ( DTRI ) help clinician match treatment patient MDD , result timely selection treatment best suit individual patient thus approach personalize treatment . The result index provide truly novel mean synthesize contribution key clinical biological parameter easy use tool clinical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study design identify biomarkers prediction differential treatment outcome SSRI antidepressant sertraline ( SERT ) placebo ( PBO ) randomize trial patient MDD . In addition , second stage collect data explore moderator mediator treatment outcomes pharmacologically distinct active treatment arm : sertraline ( SERT ) , serotonergic antidepressant bupropion ( BUP ) , nonserotonergic antidepressant . To reduce biologic heterogeneity , enroll patient early onset DSM IV MDD ( age 30 ) criterion probands show associated increase familial loading family . Patients also recurrent MDD 2 recurrence ( include current episode ) . Additionally , patient require current symptom severity score 14 Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report ( QIDS-SR ) , study screen randomization ( baseline ) visit . In first stage , patient receive 8−week course treatment one two study arm . As part Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ( SMART ) design patient achieve response end 8 week stage one treatment , define &lt; 50 % improvement Clinical Global Improvement scale ( CGI ) , switch Stage 2 treatment ( 8 week ) . Patients achieve satisfactory response ( &gt; = 50 % improvement CGI ) continue treatment additional 8 week . Specific Aims Moderator Aims ( Aim 1 ) : To identify baseline clinical , neuroimaging , neurophysiological , behavioral moderator differential treatment outcome ( mean symptom change tolerability ) sertraline ( SERT , serotonergic antidepressant ) versus placebo ( PBO ) treatment MDD . Symptom change measure use mean change baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD17 ) . Tolerability measure use Frequency , Intensity , Burden Side Effects Rating ( FIBSER ) Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale ( TESS ) . Mediator Aims ( Aim 2 ) : To identify early phase ( week 1 ) change neuroimaging , neurophysiological , behavioral task mediator differential treatment outcome ( symptom change , tolerability ) SERT PBO . Main Treatment Effects Aim ( Aim 3 ) : To compare 8-week outcome SERT vs. PBO use mixed model regression analysis maximize power discriminate treatment efficacy difference .</detailed_description>
