	<brief_summary>The primary objective Part A determine safety tolerability natalizumab administer 24 week Japanese participant relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The endpoint include assessment adverse evetns ( AEs ) , change laboratory evaluation , vital sign , Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score , change physical neurological examination finding . The secondary objective Part A characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile pharmacodynamics ( PD ) natalizumab . The primary objective Part B determine natalizumab , compare placebo , effective treat Japanese participant relapsing-remitting MS , measure new active lesion cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan 24 week . New active lesion sum gadolinium-enhancing ( Gd+ ) lesions new newly-enlarging T2-hyperintense lesion enhance . The primary endpoint rate development new active lesion 24 week . Secondary objective Part B determine 24 week whether natalizumab , compare placebo , effective reducing frequency clinical exacerbation , reduce number Gd+ lesion , reduce number new newly-enlarging T2-hyperintense lesion brain MRI scan , increase proportion relapse-free participant , improve outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) assess participant 's global impression his/her well-being . Additional objective assess safety tolerability , incidence serum antibody natalizumab PK profile natalizumab .</brief_summary>
