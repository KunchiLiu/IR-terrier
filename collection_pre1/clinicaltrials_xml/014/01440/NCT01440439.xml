	<brief_summary>Exercise important part healthy lifestyle , many people Type 1 Diabetes like take part regular sport exercise . The majority people Type 1 Diabetes treat `` basal bolus '' insulin regimen , background insulin provide long-acting `` basal '' insulin dose , `` bolus '' dose short-acting insulin use accompany food intake . Evidence show main factor prevent people diabetes pursue active lifestyle fear low blood glucose ( hypoglycaemia ) . A previous study show type background insulin affect likelihood individual suffering hypoglycaemia exercise 2 half hour afterwards . The aim study examine . The two commonly use long-acting insulin , insulin glargine insulin detemir , compare . Previous data suggests great likelihood hypoglycaemia insulin glargine insulin detemir . Exercise intensity influence likelihood hypoglycaemia , previous study exercise intensity measure use heart rate . This study use formal definition exercise intensity . The investigator study blood glucose exercise , also metabolism measure hormone affect blood glucose level well marker fat metabolism . The investigator also use continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) consider hypoglycaemia thei night follow exercise recognise consequence exercise type 1 diabetes . The null hypothesis test study difference two insulin effect blood glucose level metabolism exercise rate nocturnal hypoglycaemia exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A1 : At first appointment , potential participant screen regard inclusion criterion , eligible take part study information sheet discuss detail . Written , inform consent obtain participant willing take part study . Participants give advice support point order optimise basal insulin therapy use usual basal insulin . A2 : Following period least 3 week recruitment study , participant maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 MAX - measure capacity physical exercise ) assess . A3 : After least 4 week follow recruitment , allow time optimisation basal insulin therapy , least one week follow A2 , participant 's metabolism assess 60 minute exercise 50 % VO2 MAX . Participants fit continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) monitor glucose level 24 hour exercise finish . A4 : At least 24 hour 7 day A3 participant switch use trial insulin basal insulin therapy . Again , participant provide advice support order optimise treatment . A5 : At least 4 week follow A4 , participant 's metabolism assess 60 minute exercise 50 % VO2 MAX . Participants fit CGMS monitor glucose level 24 hour exercise finish . A6 : Once 24 hour exercise complete , study finish participant re-start usual basal insulin .</detailed_description>
