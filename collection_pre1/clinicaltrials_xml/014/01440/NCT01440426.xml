	<brief_summary>This study deal coverage multiple denude root . The current standard treatment require surgical correction use soft tissue take roof mouth enhance result . The hypothesis trial synthetic collagen matrix ( call Mucograft ) use replace soft tissue take subject . If collagen matrix prove equally effective patient tissue , possible avoid extensive surgery decrease pain discomfort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Connective Tissue Graft Versus Mucograft Collagen Matrix Coverage Multiple Gingival Recession Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The main objective study ass Mucograft Collagen Matrix reduce morbidity , shortens time recovery improve patient base outcome respect use autologous connective tissue graft harvest patient palate use obtain root coverage multiple adjacent gingival recession . The secondary objective ass non-inferiority - term complete root coverage , percentage root coverage professional evaluation aesthetic - use Mucograft Collagen Matrix autologous connective tissue harvest patient 's palate . Design Outcomes This parallel group , standard care-controlled , assessor-blind , randomize , multicenter , multinational , clinical trial . The statistical design superiority trial term primary outcome ( patient base outcomes ) non-inferiority trial term professional outcome measure root coverage aesthetic . Sample size estimate 140 subject per treatment arm use pilot case series analyze multilevel statistical approach non inferiority margin 0.25 mm recession coverage . Randomization perform computer generate random code , use random permute block block size 4 avoid uneven split minimization key prognostic factor cigarette smoking . Allocation conceal surgeon completion preparation recipient bed opaque envelope . A central study registrar perform patient registration . Study location include academic center practice-based research network Italy , Switzerland , Germany , Belgium , France , Spain Greece . A single examiner , blind respect treatment assignment , perform measurement center . Trained personnel involve surgical intervention : ) administer patient questionnaire , ii ) provide instruction collect patient diary . A single calibrate investigator specific experience use specific score centrally perform assessment esthetic score standardize digital image . A biostatistician blind respect treatment assignment perform analysis . Interventions Duration The two intervention group consist surgery connective tissue graft ( standard care control ) surgery application Mucograft Collagen Matrix ( MCM , Test group ) . Experienced clinician deliver treatment consist root coverage surgery use coronally advanced flap , utilized procedure coverage multiple recession . Surgery standardize procedures/materials employ ensure consistency . Follow-up individual patient 6 month ( extend 3 year fund available )</detailed_description>
