	<brief_summary>Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent public health problem result progressive atherosclerosis artery low extremity . PAD also associate major detrimental effect quality life functional status , important cause limb amputation . More importantly , PAD major manifestation cardiovascular disease potent predictor myocardial infarction , stroke death . Despite frequent occurrence , little known natural history PAD Hispanics represent 12.5 % United States . Because access health care limit among Hispanics , CBPR ideal process reach target population . The goal propose study evaluate community-based strategy detection treatment peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) Hispanics . The propose project consist two phase : cross-sectional phase ( PAD detection ) , follow randomization phase.During PAD detection study , prevalence severity PAD population determine . Specific risk factor associate PAD among Hispanic participant identify . During second phase patient enrol randomized , non-blinded trial compare community-based risk factor modification supervise exercise program versus usual care PAD . These individual undergo baseline evaluation similar one obtain first phase study , also include functional test low extremity .</brief_summary>
