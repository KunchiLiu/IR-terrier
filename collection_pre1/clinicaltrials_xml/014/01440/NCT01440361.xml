	<brief_summary>Chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) longterm disease blood clot normally . This due low number blood cell fragment call platelet . Platelets clot seal small cut break blood vessel wall stop bleeding . Normally immune system make protein call antibody fight harmful substance enter body . In ITP , immune system produce antibody attack destroy body 's platelet mistake . Patients suffer bleed skin , nosebleed , blood urine stool severe case bleed brain . Patients increase frequency death bleeding complication compare normal . Chronic ITP fairly rare , incidence 32 new cases/million people year . Existing treatment work lower activity immune system directly increase platelet count . These treatment work effectively patient side effect . We hope understand belimumab work ITP help development future treatment ITP autoimmune disease . We test safety , blood level effect study medication people chronic ITP . Patients receive study medication intravenously ( needle insert vein ) blood sample take several occasion afterwards . Up 40 patient chronic ITP , age 18 75 participate . Approximately 11 patient take dummy medicine instead study medicine neither study doctor know one give . Participants take 57 week finish study . They 'll make 12 outpatient visit . The study take place hospital UK . Other site mainland Europe may also initiate . A pharmaceutical company , GlaxoSmithKline , funding study .</brief_summary>
