	<brief_title>IL-12 Gene Vivo Electroporation-Mediated Plasmid DNA Vaccine Therapy Patients With Merkel Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure effect intratumoral injection IL-12 plasmid ( pIL-12 ) ( interleukin-12 gene ) follow vivo electroporation ( EP ) ( electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy ) local expression interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) tumor microenvironment patient Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety intratumoral pIL-12 injection vivo EP MCC . II . To assess clinical efficacy treatment approach MCC . III . To assess immunologic change result treatment approach . OUTLINE : Patients receive interleukin-12 gene intratumorally ( IT ) undergo electrical discharge around tumor site electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy day 1 , 5 , 8 . Patients unresectable disease may receive second course treatment week 7 . Patients localized disease proceed definitive treatment determine treat physician start 2-4 week first injection . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 4-8 ( patient receive definitive treatment ) 12 ( patient unresectable disease ) annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
