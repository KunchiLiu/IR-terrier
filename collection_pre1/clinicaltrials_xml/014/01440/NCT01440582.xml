	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose drug panobinostat give combination drug Velcade ( bortezomib ) , Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) , Decadron ( dexamethasone ) patient MM . The safety drug combination also study . Panobinostat design cause chemical change different group protein attach DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may slow growth cancer cell cause cancer cell die . Bortezomib design block protein cause cell grow . This may cause cancer cell die . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may slow growth cancer cell . Dexamethasone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Dexamethasone often give MM patient combination chemotherapy treat cancer .</brief_summary>
