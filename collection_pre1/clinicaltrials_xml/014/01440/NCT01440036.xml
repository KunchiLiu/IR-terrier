	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Enzyme Paraoxigenase 1 ( PON1 ) Carotid Artery Atheromatous Plaque</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis major risk factor morbidity mortality western world . It characterize accumulation fat ( cholesterol ) arterial wall , creation atheromatous plague creation arterial stenosis occlusion . The cellular content thesis plaque include : fibroblast , endothelial cell , smooth muscle cell , macrophage , lipid : phospholipid , cholesterol , oxysterols fatty acid . Lipids penetration blood stream collaborate different protein , include anti-atherogenic enzyme - paraoxygenase 1 - PON1 . This enzyme many ani-atherogenic activity , e.g . Protection oxygenation increase cholesterol efflux macrophage HDL . Although enzyme verity substrates know anti-atherogenous function , mechanism still vogue . The enzymes accumulation rate function advancement fatty strike towards advance lesion . There evidence presence accumulation activity PON1 within plaque , defense mechanism atherosclerosis development . The assumption prove PON1 control plaque 's content influence atherogenous factor . Furthermore , try identify factor PON1 act . Beside plaque 's content PON1 's influence , would like investigate phenotype haptoglobin subject plaques remove . It known diabetic genotype haptoglobin 2-2 , characterize increase risk oxygenation stress cardiovascular event ( 5 time ) . We would like examine correlation plaque 's content , PON1 's ability disassemble oxygenized factor within plaque , phenotype haptoglobin . Methods : The plaque source carotid endarterectomy , vascular unit . This procedure routine operation patient suffer carotid artery stenosis , base clinical decision . The plaque transport lipid laboratory soon harvest , frozen liquid nitrogen process powder . This material origin protein try extract . Patient 's blood sample ( drawn routinely operation ) source characterization haptoglobin 's genotype . It critical emphasize routinely , plaque waste product , 5 cc additional blood withdrawn patient research purpose .</detailed_description>
