	<brief_summary>The purpose study asses efficacy 4 week low-intensity resistance training program concurrent application partial blood flow restriction ( PBFR ) exercise limbs improve quadriceps strength size , leg muscle power , mobility woman risk develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis . The primary outcome change isotonic double leg-press 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM ) strength . The investigator test follow hypothesis . In comparison low-intensity resistance training without use PBFR , four-week low-intensity resistance-training program PBFR : Primary Hypothesis : Increase ( ) double leg-press 1RM strength ( b ) isokinetic knee extensor strength Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Increase quadriceps muscle volume assess MRI 2 . Increase low limb muscle power ( ) double leg-press 40 % 1RM ( b ) time stair climb 3 . Not adversely effect knee pain quality life assess Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire</brief_summary>
