	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well dasatinib work together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient stage III , stage IV endometrial cancer come back period improvement . Dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving dasatinib together paclitaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib , Paclitaxel , Carboplatin Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine impact dasatinib ephrin type-A receptor 2 ( EphA2 ) expression tissue biopsies patient previously untreated , advanced-staged , measurable primary recurrent endometrial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4 ( CTCAE v. 4 ) dasatinib administer combination paclitaxel carboplatin patient advanced-staged measurable primary recurrent endometrial cancer . II . To record objective response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v.1.1 . III . To describe progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) 520d-3p ( miR520d-3p ) EphA2 pretreatment biopsy . II . To evaluate downstream EphA2 signal effector , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , paxillin , p130cas pre- post-tissue treatment biopsy . III . To explore effect dasatinib expression Eph family member EphB2 EphB4 . IV . To quantify circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) individual treatment phase . OUTLINE : Patients receive induction therapy comprise dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 14 day . *Beginning 7 day later , patient receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV day 1 , dasatinib PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : * Patients prior external-beam pelvic extended-field pelvic/para-aortic radiation therapy must receive treatment reduce dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
