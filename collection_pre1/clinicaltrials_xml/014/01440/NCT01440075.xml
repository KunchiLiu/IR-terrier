	<brief_summary>Kawasaki disease ( KD ) acute systemic vasculitic syndrome coronary tropism . It report worldwide , ten time common Asian population . The annual incidence child 5 year Europe estimate 8 100000 . It second vasculitis child frequency rheumatoid purpura . It occur 80 % case 1 5 year , maximal incidence around age 12 month . It may result acquire heart disease child develop country , may cause premature coronary artery disease adulthood . A polymorphism recently associate occurrence disease Japanese U.S population . ( C allele SNP itpkc_3 , risk multiply 2 ) . However , data conflict issue prevalence allel unknown North America Europe population . The clinical picture KD associate persistent fever antipyretic resistance mucocutaneous sign bulky cervical lymphadenopathy usually unilateral . Diagnosis confirm presence five clinical sign ( major criterion ) . The presence inconsistent coronary lesion cardiac ultrasound confirm diagnosis . KD resolve spontaneously treatment . The severity disease primarily relate complication coronary aneurysm acute chronic stage . Several argument support fact adult patient diffuse vascular lesion different aneurysmal lesion initially describe childhood . Despite abundance publication KD , prospective retrospective study explore anomaly result KD adult subject . Therefore , project describe patient 's vascular evolution , prevalence atherosclerotic lesion determine biological functional abnormality , marker accelerate atherosclerosis . Hypothesis : A history Kawasaki disease represent cardiovascular risk factor adulthood . The main objective evaluate prevalence atherosclerotic lesion , extent severity adult history KD childhood compare control population .</brief_summary>
