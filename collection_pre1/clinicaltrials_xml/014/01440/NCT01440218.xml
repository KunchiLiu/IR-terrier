	<brief_summary>This research do learn possible genetic cause currently undiagnosed condition , find development new technology , DNA sequencing , increase knowledge role genetic variant play disorder possibly genetic variant may help de-termine best treatment option . The recent development new technology increase ability understand genetic mutation associate disease . Using technology find genetic variant responsible rare disease rapidly grow field already begin transform way condition unknown cause diagnose treat . Hypothesis : Identification new genomic variant associate idiopathic disease and/or disease unknown etiology advance medical knowledge rare common disease .</brief_summary>
