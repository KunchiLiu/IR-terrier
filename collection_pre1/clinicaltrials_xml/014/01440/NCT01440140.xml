	<detailed_description>Achievement tight glycaemic control type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) use intensive insulin regimen , show important prevention long term diabetes-related complication , limited significantly increase risk hypoglycaemia . The average patient T1D suffers two symptomatic episode hypoglycaemia per week , one episode severe hypoglycaemia , define event require assistance another person administer rescue treatment form carbohydrate and/or glucagon , per year.Despite rapid advancement insulin pump technology ongoing development physiological insulin preparation , currently available therapeutic regimen still unable achieve optimal glycaemic control.The emergence continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) last decade , enable user view real-time estimate plasma glucose receive alarm impend hypo- hyperglycaemia , thus facilitate appropriate change insulin therapy , major step towards improve diabetes monitor . The desirable goal development insulin delivery glucose responsive development effective real time glucose monitoring allow . Glucose responsive insulin delivery allow achievement ideal glucose target le risk hypoglycaemia . Closed-loop system may provide realistic treatment option people T1D . The research conduct University Cambridge focus develop closed-loop system overnight glucose control patient T1D . The study perform far employ model predictive control ( MPC ) - algorithm estimate patient-specific parameter CGM measurement take every 1 15 minute make prediction glucose excursion , use calculate basal insulin infusion rate . We hypothesize overnight automate closed-loop glucose control home set efficacious safe compare CGM alone , T1D subject insulin pump treatment .</detailed_description>
