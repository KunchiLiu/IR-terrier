	<brief_summary>High risk neuroblastoma ( NB ) aggressive , prevalent non-brain cancer derive nerve cell body . It mostly affect infant , child die tumor year cure . Standard therapy include combination chemotherapy , surgery , bone marrow transplant , radiation immunotherapy . NB sensitive radiation , due 's aggressive spread pattern , radiation use currently limited toxicity . This study seek improve delivery radiation reduce toxicity quantify outcome , measure difference renal toxicity organ motion radiation focus effectively tumor spar normal tissue reduce side-effects .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) High Risk Abdominal Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma receive high-risk neuroblastoma treatment regimen eligible enroll prior surgical resection primary tumor . Following implantation fiducial marker within tumor bed autologous hematopoietic rescue , patient begin plan process abdominal irradiation ; require multiple baseline study , include compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , renal scintigraphy , bloodwork . Most test repeat vary schedule five year follow-up period protocol , order evaluate impact conformal radiotherapy intra-abdominal tissue . Intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) delivery follow current conventional volume-targeting guideline , however , appropriate application within abdomen determine ascertain intra-abdominal organ motion potential reduce normal tissue dose , simultaneously increase dose deliver target tissue , particularly dose escalation gross residual disease require . Concurrent neuro-hormonal test , cytokine analysis , functional morphologic image generate novel data describe acute chronic effect radiotherapy within abdomen . NOTE : This study currently close accrual , however , expect re-open accrual later 2015 .</detailed_description>

Prior treatment regimen must follow guideline applicable highrisk neuroblastoma regimen . Slight variation timeframe acceptable base recovery blood count concern leave discretion treat radiation oncologist . Patients receive surgical management elsewhere still consider eligible enroll protocol therapy assessment primary local control objective , renal motion toxicity assessment . Target motion objective may exclude analysis patient . Exclusion Criteria Patients receive prior definitive radiotherapy adjacent primary abdominal tumor bed . Patients unable cooperate acquisition 4dimensional compute tomography ( 4DCT ) , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) base imaging procedure . Patients know brain metastasis . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , cardiac , hepatic , renal disease ) . Pregnant woman . Mediastinal primary tumor . Patients receive surgery elsewhere , St. Jude within 3 month prior study activation , exclude assessment target motion objective . However still eligible enroll assessment primary objective , renal motion toxicity .</criteria>
