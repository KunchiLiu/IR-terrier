	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether TH-302 combination Doxorubicin safe effective treatment Locally Advanced Unresectable Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial TH-302 Combination With Doxorubicin Versus Doxorubicin Alone Treat Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TH-302 design target hypoxic region tumor generally locate distant tumor vessel . Doxorubicin poor tissue penetration target region tumor locate proximity tumor vessel . The presence hypoxia solid tumor associate malignant phenotype resistance chemotherapy . The hypoxia-activated prodrug , TH-302 , design selectively target hypoxic microenvironment . Soft tissue sarcomas evidence support presence hypoxia base pO2 histography , F-MISO gene expression profile . There absence therapeutic option subject soft tissue sarcoma . Combining doxorubicin TH-302 may enable target normoxic hypoxic region soft tissue sarcoma .</detailed_description>
