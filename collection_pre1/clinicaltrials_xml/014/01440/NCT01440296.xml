	<brief_summary>The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network ( CAIN ) pan-canadian imaging network fund grant Canadian Foundation Innovation ( CFI ) Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) . This unique research network focus pathobiology atherosclerotic disease pertains coronary carotid circulation . The CAIN research program involve creation unique national network focus vivo image vessel wall disease , combine image occult end-organ disease well acquisition clinical pathological end point . CAIN enables unprecedented cross-sectional longitudinal clinical study patient atherosclerotic disease coronary carotid vascular bed , establish international resource study natural history , progression , regression novel therapeutic intervention aim atherosclerosis . The primary outcome study accurately characterise carotid plaque morphology non-surgical patient mild severe ( 30-95 % ) carotid disease . The investigator also assess evidence ischaemic brain disease . Patients undergo MRI scan brain carotid US scan carotid baseline thereafter 1 2 year sooner present clinically order monitor natural history carotid atherosclerosis effect end-organ brain disease . Patients consent baseline scan follow 1 2 year , databasing clinical imaging data . After image session image process , store locally also sent central repository . 500 patient recruit 2 year period anticipation study completion within 4 year .</brief_summary>
