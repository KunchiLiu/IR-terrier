	<brief_summary>The classical method spinal anesthesia relies use bony landmark identify level point entry spinal needle . Over year , experience hand , method consistently prove successful safe . The introduction ultrasound guide neuraxial anaesthesia clinical practice relatively slow compare peripheral nerve block central venous catheterization . This could due technical difficulty pose bony structure surround spinal cord dura block path ultrasound beam . Many anesthetist reluctant change conventional landmark technique , particularly study show change success rate ultrasound guide landmark technique . Several study however show ultrasound guide approach reduces number attempt achieve successful block reduces procedure time particularly obese patient technical difficulty . In study investigator try answer follow question : Is advantage use ultrasound guide spinal anaesthesia non obese obstetric patient easily palpable bony landmark ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients randomize use web base randomization program two group : Ultrasound guide spinal anesthesia ( US ) &amp; conventional spinal anesthesia ( C ) . In group , level third fourth lumbar inter-space ( L3/4 L4/5 ) identify use either ultrasound ( transverse longitudinal approach ) palpation method use anatomical landmark . All ultrasound examination spinal anesthesia perform 3 anesthetist experience ultrasound guide neuraxial block ( 100 200 case ) . The ultrasound examination do use Logiq e TM ultrasound machine ( GE Solingen Germany ) 4C RS 2 - 5.5MHz Broadband multi-frequency probe . The predetermined point entry introducer needle mark patient 's back . The spinal anaesthesia administer patient sit position , use 26 gauge pencil point needle ( PortexTM ) 15 mg heavy Bupivacaine 20 microgram Fentanyl . An independent observer , blind method use identify point entry introducer needle , collect data.The spinal anesthesia label successful bilateral block sixth thoracic dermatome ( T6 ) , judge loss cold touch discrimination , establish 5 minute spinal injection .</detailed_description>
