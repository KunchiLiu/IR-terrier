	<brief_summary>Background : - Fenoterol use treat asthma opening airway lung . It also increase heart rate without significantly increase blood pressure . This mean may help improve heart function boost heart 's output . Researchers develop different form drug may give individual heart trouble . This new form need test . It especially important compare new form original form drug use treat asthma . Objectives : - To compare safe effective two different form Fenoterol improve heart function . Eligibility : - Healthy people 21 60 year age history heart disease . Design : - People screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , heart function study . - Those study two 36-hour inpatient study visit . At visit , physical exam blood urine test . They fast overnight receive one two form Fenoterol first thing morning . They know whether get original modified form drug . After receive drug , provide frequent blood urine sample 24 hour . They final exam discharge . - Those take part study followup visit 5 7 day end study visit . They provide blood urine sample physical exam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Study Fenoterol Treatment Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fenoterol drug use treatment disease like asthma many year . It available Canada inhale form call Berotec . Fenoterol stimulate receptor body call Beta Adrenergic Receptors therefore family drug call Beta Agonists . While one particular form drug , call Racemic mixture traditionally use asthma , multiple form drug produce possible use one new form drug benefit people heart failure . Treatment heart failure complex problem . It problem heart pump enough blood meet demand body number change ultimately prove harmful attempt compensate failure . Scientists observe several effect Fenoterol may prove beneficial people heart failure . Use old Fenoterol ( Racemic ) mixture indicate drug cause heart pump blood rest body increase person heart rate little effect blood pressure . These effect provide rationale attempt develop Fenoterol possible treatment congestive heart failure . It hop new form drug prove even benefit . However , new form drug ( call R R form ) yet test human . Animal study scientific understand type mixture suggest little difference old Racemic form . To test think determine dos use future study , conduct Phase I , escalate dose study healthy volunteer use orally administer form old Racemic mixture newer R R form . This study consist three group 6 people take dos drug mouth monitor heart rate , blood pressure , blood chemistry , genetic factor , heart function . The first group get 2.5 mg dose R R form drug one visit 5 mg dose racemic mixture visit . The second group get 5mg dose R R form one visit 10mg dose Racemic mixture . Finally , third group get 10mg dose R R form one visit 20mg dose Racemic mixture . Also , blood collect regular interval monitor level drug , rate breakdown , change blood chemistry , test various gene . All research perform National Institute Aging ( NIA ) Clinical Research Unit locate 5th floor Harbor Hospital Baltimore , MD . Testing safety breakdown drug compare old Racemic form important first step development new drug heart failure . The specific aim : 1 . A Phase 1 study healthy volunteer establish body absorption breakdown new form Fenoterol ( R R form ) comparison old , establish Racemic mixture . 2 . To monitor effect drug heart rate , blood pressure , cardiac structure function person take drug . Endpoint : This study provide safety assessment determine pharmacokinetics bioavailability ( R , R ) - racemic Fenoterol healthy subject . In addition , information gain pharmacodynamics Fenoterol . This provide information future study evaluate ( R , R ) -Fenoterol potential treatment congestive heart failure .</detailed_description>
