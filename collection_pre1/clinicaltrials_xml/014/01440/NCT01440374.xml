	<brief_summary>This worldwide , three-part ( Part 1 : open-label , Part 2 : randomize , double-blind , Part 3 : extension ) , multi-center study evaluate effect eltrombopag subject myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) thrombocytopenia due bone marrow insufficiency underlie disease prior chemotherapy . This objective assess composite primary endpoint consist follow : proportion ≥Grade 3 hemorrhagic adverse event , platelet count &lt; 10 Gi/L , platelet transfusion . Patients MDS AML Grade 4 thrombocytopenia due bone marrow insufficiency underlie disease prior chemotherapy enrol study . No low intermediate-1 risk MDS subject enrol study . Subjects must least one follow 4 week prior enrolment : platelet count &lt; 10 Gi/L , platelet transfusion , symptomatic hemorrhagic event . Supportive standard care ( SOC ) , include hydroxyurea , allow indicate local practice throughout study . The study 3 sequential part . Subjects enrol Part 1 ( open-label ) enrol Part 2 study ( randomize , double-blind ) ; however , subject complete treatment period Part 1 Part 2 ( 8 12 week , respectively ) continue Part 3 ( extension ) investigator determines subject receive clinical benefit treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult subject ( 18 year age old ) MDS AML ( bone marrow blast ≤50 % ) thrombocytopenia due bone marrow insufficiency disease prior treatment . Subjects transient thrombocytopenia due active treatment disease modify agent chemotherapy ( except hydroxyurea ) exclude Subjects must Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 25 Gi/L ) due bone marrow insufficiency ( Grade 4 thrombocytopenia , platelet count great equal 25 Gi/L due platelet transfusion ) . In addition , subject must least one follow 4 week screening period : platelet transfusion , symptomatic bleeding platelet count &lt; 10 Gi/L . Subjects whose thrombocytopenia 10 Gi/L due cause bone marrow insufficiency ( e.g. , fever , infection , autoimmune disease ) eligible . Subjects must platelet count , bleed platelet transfusion data available period least 4 week prior randomization . Prior systemic treatment malignancy , exception hydroxyurea , ﻿must discontinue prior entry study : least 4 week Day 1 follow : chemotherapy , demethylating agent ( azacitidine decitabine ) , lenalidomide , thalidomide , clofarabine IL11 ( oprelvekin ) ; least 8 week Day 1 antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin . Subjects prior stem cell transplant ( SCT ) must relapse SCT . Subjects must stable , opinion investigator , expect complete 12 week treatment period . ECOG Status 02 . Subject must able understand comply protocol requirement instruction . Subject sign date informed consent form . Adequate baseline organ function define criterion : total bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN except Gilbert 's syndrome case clearly indicative inadequate liver function ( i.e . elevation indirect ( hemolytic ) bilirubin absence ALT abnormality ) , ALT ≤ 3xULN , creatinine ≤ 2.5xULN Women must either nonchild bear potential woman childbearing potential men reproductive potential must willing practice acceptable method birth control study Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate , beneficiary , social security category . Subjects MDS IPSS low intermediate1 risk screen . Subjects diagnosis acute promyelocytic megakaryocytic leukemia AML secondary myeloproliferative neoplasm . History treatment romiplostim TPOR agonists . Subjects QTc &gt; 480 msec ( QTc &gt; 510 msec subject Bundle Branch Block ) . Leukocytosis ≥25,000/uL Day 1 treatment study medication . Subjects know thrombophilic risk factor . Exception : Subjects potential benefit participate study outweigh potential risk thromboembolic event , determine investigator . Female subject nurse pregnant ( positive serum urine βhuman chorionic gonadotropin [ βhCG ] pregnancy test ) screen predose Day 1 . Current alcohol drug abuse . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Active uncontrolled infection ( e.g . sepsis , hepatitis B , hepatitis C ) . Subjects infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . Subjects liver cirrhosis ( determined investigator ) . Subjects receive plan receive prohibit medication . Have know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate eltrombopag excipient ( microcrystalline cellulose , mannitol , polyvinylpyrrolidone , sodium starch glycolate , magnesium stearate , hypromellose , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol 400 polysorbate 80 ) contraindicate subject ' participation . In France , subject participate study use investigational drug previous 30 day .</criteria>
