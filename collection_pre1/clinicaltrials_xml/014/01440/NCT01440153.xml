	<brief_summary>Professional dancing require almost perfect control technical skill , combine good physical condition . To meet demand choreography , dancer need adequate aerobic endurance capacity , muscular strength well flexibility motor control ( Twitchett et al . 2009 ; Roussel et al . 2009 ) . One could compare requirement athlete . In contrast athlete , attention give prevention injury dancer . Professional dancer high risk develop musculoskeletal injury , especially , soft tissue overuse injury low extremity spine ( Hincapi√© et al , 2008 ) . Several potential risk factor injury suggest , reduce level aerobic fitness , lack muscular strength , hypermobility joint alter motor control lumbopelvic region conclusive evidence exists item separately . Applying sport science principle dance training may improve performance dancer ( Twitchett et al . 2009 ) . Dancers demonstrate low aerobic fitness muscle strength , contrast high demand .

After baseline assessment , consist evaluation physical condition ( maximal exercise test , evaluation respiratory capacity &amp; evaluation explosive muscle strength use field test ) , motor control evaluation lumbo-pelvic region evaluation anthropometric measurement , participant randomly divide 2 group . They receive 4 month last intervention addition regular dance lesson . The time schedule intervention identical group . Participants group A receive active program aim improve cardiovascular endurance , muscular strength motor control . The level cardiovascular training base result maximal exercise test perform baseline assessment .
