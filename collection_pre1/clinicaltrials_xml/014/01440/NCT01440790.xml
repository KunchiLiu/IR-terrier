	<detailed_description>Recently , much attention pay evidence abnormality postprandial state ( hyperglycemia ) important contribute factor development chronic disease . This attention increase interest role low glycemic index ( GI ) food could potentially play prevent postprandial oxidative burst/stress . GI mean categorize carbohydrate accord postprandial glycemic response . Low GI food promote slow intestinal absorption , prolong less pronounced postprandial glycemia , may decrease risk chronic disease , well provide metabolic benefit people live glucose abnormality well normal glucose . Few study conduct look potential relationship GI oxidation limit dietary/lifestyle confounders . The propose study develop eliminate confounders . Hypotheses ( 3 ) : 1 . Sipping glucose slowly 3h result less oxidative stress ingest amount glucose bolus 5min . 2 . Sipping glucose reduce oxidative stress extent 1g oral vitamin C. 3 . The effect sip glucose oxidative stress occur sooner vitamin C .</detailed_description>
