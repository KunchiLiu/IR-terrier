	<brief_summary>Many researcher suspect individual Tourette Syndrome ( TS ) may poor cognitive ability ( i.e. , response inhibition ; RI ) essential inhibit inappropriate response vocal motor tic . The investigator aim test whether well-established behavior therapy TS improve increase individual 's RI capability . To end , 20 child randomly assign behavior therapy computer-based RI training behavior therapy placebo computer-based cognitive training . The investigator test hypothesis computer-based RI training useful addition well-established behavior therapy enhance therapeutic effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current research seek examine feasibility use computer-based RI training program adjunctive intervention Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention Tics ( CBIT ) . Our central hypothesis cognitive training design enhance RI potentiate treatment outcomes CBIT . To end , investigator conduct two-arm placebo-controlled double-blind trial , 20 child TS randomly assign CBIT computerized RI training ( CBIT+RIT ; n=10 ) CBIT placebo computer training ( CBIT +PLT ; n=10 ) . CBIT consist eight weekly session present awareness training , compete response training , relaxation train functional contingency management manualized format . The adjunctive computer training ( RIT PLT ) deliver first 4 week CBIT/HRT ( i.e . 8 twice-weekly 40-min session ) . Tic symptom RI capability assess baseline , mid-treatment , post-treatment , 1 month follow-up . This project expect increase understanding nature response inhibition deficit TS generate knowledge guide development effective cognitive intervention TS .</detailed_description>
