	<brief_summary>This Phase I trial combine ADI-PEG 20 docetaxel patient advance solid tumor emphasis castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . The investigator hypothesize combination result great tumor cytotoxicity acceptable toxicity profile ( i.e. , manageable side effect ) cancer patient due unique mechanism action ADI-PEG 20 . The investigator also hypothesize combination ADI-PEG 20 docetaxel result enhance tumor cell apoptosis part due autophagy particularly relevant CRPC .</brief_summary>

Patients must 18 year age old . 3 . Patients must Zubrod ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 4 . Patients must estimate survival least 3 month . 5 . Any prior chemotherapy must complete least 4 week prior start treatment . Prior radiation must complete least 2 week prior start therapy . Patients must recover acute reversible side effect prior chemotherapy regimen radiotherapy &lt; grade 1 ( exclude alopecia , lymphopenia , hyperglycemia ) accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCICTCAE ) , version 4.0 . 6 . Radiographs ( Xrays , CT scan , etc ) follow disease response progression must complete within 28 day prior registration . 7 . Patients must adequate renal function document calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45 ml/min ( see Appendix formula calculate creatinine clearance ) . 8 . Patients must adequate liver function : AST ALT &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal , bilirubin &lt; upper limit normal . MTD Expansion Phase Cohort 1 CRPC 1 . All patient must histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate measurable nonmeasurable . 2 . Patients must metastatic prostate cancer deem unresponsive refractory hormone therapy one following ( despite androgen deprivation antiandrogen withdrawal applicable ) : Progression measurable disease assess within 28 day prior registration . Progression nonmeasurable disease assess within 28 day prior registration . Rising PSA Rising PSA define least two consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( measure 2 ) must take least 7 day reference value . A third confirmatory PSA measure require ( 2nd beyond reference level ) great second measure , must obtain least 7 day 2nd measure . If case , fourth PSA require take great second measure . The patient must PSA â‰¥ 5 ng/ml addition increase PSA eligible rise PSA criterion alone . However , minimum PSA require patient whose progression base measurable nonmeasurable disease . 3 . All patient must prestudy PSA obtain within 28 day prior registration . 4 . All patient must image study within 28 day prior registration . The choice image study follow disease discretion investigator . 5 . Patients must offer opportunity participate specimen bank future use ( include serum tissue correlative study ) . 6 . Patients must surgically medically castrate . If method castration LHRH agonist ( leuprolide goserelin ) LHRH antagonist , patient willing continue use LHRH agonist . Patients stop treatment willing restart . 7 . If patient treat nonsteroidal antiandrogens ( flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ketoconazole ) , must stop least 14 day prior registration ketoconazole least 28 day prior registration flutamide , bicalutamide nilutamide patient must demonstrate progression . 8 . Prior , plan , ongoing bisphosphonate therapy denosumab allow . ( DoseEscalation Phase ) 1 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . The effect drug unborn fetus unknown . Documentation negative serum pregnancy test require woman reproductive potential . 2 . Patient clinically significant concurrent illness . Patients must serious intercurrent medical psychiatric illness , include serious active infection . 3 . Patient currently enrol different clinical study investigational procedure perform investigational therapy administer . Also , patient may enroll clinical trial participate study . 4 . Patient history allergy hypersensitivity study drug taxane . 5 .
