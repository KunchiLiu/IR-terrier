	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib tosylate together hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose give sorafenib tosylate together hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 see well work treat patient advanced kidney cancer liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug TH-302 Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dosing ( RP2D ) combination sorafenib tosylate hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 ( TH-302 ) patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ; non-HCC ) advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate overall response rate ( RR ) determine base modify RECIST criterion ( Lencioni Llovet 2010 ) patient advance HCC receive sorafenib tosylate TH-302 . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To characterize overall toxicity profile sorafenib tosylate + TH-302 within patient HCC RCC ( non-HCC ) advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) - To characterize response sorafenib tosylate + TH-302 within patient HCC RCC ( non-HCC ) advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) - To assess adverse event ( AEs ) profile safety profile sorafenib tosylate combination TH-302 patient advance HCC . ( Phase II ) - To estimate overall response rate base standard RECIST criterion study population . ( Phase II ) - To estimate duration response base modify ( standard ) RECIST criterion study population . ( Phase II ) - To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) study population . ( Phase II ) - To estimate overall survival ( OS ) study population . ( Phase II ) - To estimate alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) response rate ( define &gt; 20 % decrease AFP baseline ) study population . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 IV 30 minute day 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo blood sample collection periodically study alpha-fetoprotein analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
