	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose dovitinib lactate give together gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine treat patient advanced metastatic solid tumor advance pancreatic cancer . Dovitinib lactate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving dovitinib lactate together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose dovitinib ( dovitinib lactate ) administer concurrently gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) capecitabine patient advance solid malignancy . II . To characterize safety profile dovitinib , gemcitabine capecitabine combination patient advance solid malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile dovitinib , capecitabine , gemcitabine metabolite administer concurrently patient advance solid malignancy . II . To determine preliminary efficacy study combination patient advance adenocarcinoma pancreas biliary tract . III . To explore serum tumor biomarkers predictive efficacy study combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dovitinib lactate . Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 , capecitabine PO twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
