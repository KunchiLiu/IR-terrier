	<brief_summary>The Problem Distal radius fracture ( DRF ) common result variable amount disability . The investigator complete considerable work developing tool measure impairment disability DRF . The investigator initial study indicate associate disablement process multifactorial variable 25 % resultant disability predict baseline patient injury characteristic . The investigator see DRF signal event people at-risk transition active lifestyle inactivity subsequent health risk . The investigator recent data confirms variable participation follow DRF . The traditional focus orthopedic/rehabilitative approach DRF fracture management localized wrist , largely ignore potential transition health impact . The investigator initiate line investigation profile at-risk older adult present DRF ultimate goal accurate identification prevention adverse activity transition ( active inactive ) . In study investigator identify extent problem quantifying change activity/participation short-term health impact . The investigator also identify risk factor present time injury predict loss mobility/activity/participation . This work potential identify tool and/or clinical prediction rule identify at-risk individual critical time early intervention might easily prevent adverse outcome associate inactivity .</brief_summary>
