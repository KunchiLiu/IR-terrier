	<brief_summary>This study address follow question : Does cyclosporine affect pharmacokinetics pravastatin healthy volunteer ? Studies show cyclosporine inhibits organic anion transporter require pravastatin transport liver , thus increase pravastatin level blood . The investigator hypothesize inhibition vary among people base genetic difference . This knowledge important help develop safe effective drug therapy reduce side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug-Drug Interaction Study With Pravastatin Cyclosporine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening Procedures : Prior enrollment , subject ask come Clinical Translational Science ( CTSI ) Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) San Francisco General Hospital ( SFGH ) . The study protocol procedure explain detail , question answer , subject provide consent form sign . The screen visit conduct within 14 day first inpatient visit ( i.e . first pravastatin placebo pravastatin cyclosporine dose day ) Only subject consent participate study screen procedure commence . During screen visit , vital sign well blood sample ( 10 mL ) take venipuncture measure complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrolytes , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , liver function test ( LFTs ) screen anemia renal hepatic insufficiency ( see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria ) Procedures During Main Study : An equal number subject randomize , computer program , one two study arm describe . On first day study , subject dose either 100 mg cyclosporine placebo 8PM , follow overnight fast . On morning Day 2 , subject ask take second dose 100 mg cyclosporine placebo 8AM . At 9AM Day 2 , subject ask take 40 mg pravastatin . Plasma sample ( 5 ml ) collect baseline ( prior pravastatin administration ) , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 hour post-dose . Whole blood also collect 12 hour post-dose measure cyclosporine level . The procedure second visit study identical first , dose 100 mg cyclosporine placebo , opposite dose first study visit . Clinical Laboratory Determinations : Analytical Methods : Measurement pravastatin plasma perform High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS ) , use assay previously describe validate .</detailed_description>
