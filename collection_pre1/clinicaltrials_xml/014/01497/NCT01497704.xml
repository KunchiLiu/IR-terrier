	<brief_summary>This protocol divide two part : Part 1 evaluate safety pharmacokinetics three dos YN968D1 single administration follow 28-Day continuous course therapy ; Part 2 evaluate safety preliminary efficacy open-label administration YN968D1 MTD maximum 750 mg. All subject Part 1 Part 2 study permit continue therapy safety monitor bimonthly assessment progression , product well tolerated subject stable disease well . Up 72 subject enrol clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Safety Trial YN968D1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 include sequential evaluation 3 subject per cohort ; cohort 1 dose 100 mg YN968D1 , follow cohort 2 , 3 4 dos 250 mg , 500 mg 750 mg respectively . Initially , subject receive one dose YN968D1 follow 7-Day observation period , single dose PK assessments safety monitoring perform . If initial dose well tolerate , subject return Day 8 receive 28-Days continuous YN968D1 oral administration daily . Each subject subsequently assess safety disease progression Day 35±2 steady state pharmacokinetic sampling obtain . Patients may continue therapy additional 28-Day cycle without dose interruption therapy well tolerate . Efficacy assessment ( biomarkers ) disease progression ( RECIST image ) assess every two 28-Day cycle . The subject assess safety least 28-Days last dose YN968D1 . For Part 1 study , Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) event define follow event assess Investigator probably possibly relate YN968D1 occur initial dose Day 1 Day 35 first cycle therapy . - CTCAE Grade 4 event - Grade 3 febrile neutropenia ( &lt; 1,000 neutrophils/mL ) - Grade 3 hematologic toxicity duration &gt; 7 day - Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity ( except nausea , vomit , diarrhea continue despite optimal medical management ) If DLT experience cohort , cohort expand 6 subject . If two ( 2 ) DLTs experience cohort , study pause safety event evaluate discussed FDA determine trial may continue . Part 2 study include 30 subject . Each subject receive 750 mg dose maximum tolerate dose YN968D1 part 1 study continuous 28-Day cycle therapy . If subject experience intolerable side effect dose reduction dose interruption 7-Days allow discretion investigator . Subjects evaluate RECIST ( version 1.1 ) response end second cycle therapy Day 56±3 Part 2 study . Safety report continue 28-Days last dose study medication . All subject Part 1 2 trial eligible continue therapy provide least stable disease well , opinion investigator , adequately tolerate treatment YN968D1 .</detailed_description>
