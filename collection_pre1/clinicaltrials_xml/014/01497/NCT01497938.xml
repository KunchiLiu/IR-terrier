	<brief_summary>Introduction : The purpose pivotal In Home study collect clinical data safety efficacy Paradigm LGS System actual use environment intend use population . ASPIRE multi-center , home , randomize parallel adaptive study design type 1 diabetes . The study compare A1C CGM base nocturnal hypoglycemic event treatment arm control arm . Arms define : - Treatment Arm ( LGS ON ) use Paradigm® VEO™ Pump - Control Arm ( NO LGS FEATURE ) use Paradigm® Revel™2.0 Pump The study 's objective two-fold : 1 . The first study objective demonstrate home use Low Glucose Suspend ( LGS ) safe associate glycemic deterioration , measure change A1C baseline end study participation . 2 . The second study objective demonstrate home use Low Glucose Suspend ( LGS ) associate reduction nocturnal hypoglycemia patient fail respond . Primary Safety Endpoint : The change A1C randomization end treatment period use demonstrate automatic insulin delivery suspension ( LGS ON ) result unacceptable worsen glycemic control .</brief_summary>
