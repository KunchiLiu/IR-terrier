	<brief_summary>This study patient advance type cancer curative treatment exists . The purpose study test safety efficacy combination study drug , lapatinib bortezomib . Lapatinib drug target two protein important growth cancer cell know HER1 ( EGFR ) HER2 . By inhibit protein , lapatinib inhibit cancer cell growth even lead death . Lapatinib oral pill give mouth every day . Lapatinib approve FDA patient breast cancer . Bortezomib drug target part cancer cell know proteosome . By inhibit proteosome , bortezomib inhibit cancer cell growth even lead death . Bortezomib give intravenously , week , 2 every 3 week . Bortezomib approve FDA patient multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma . This research do know combination lapatinib bortezomib work well lapatinib bortezomib alone , although lab animal study combination two drug much effective either drug alone . As part study biopsy take patient ' tumor treatment , start lapatinib alone , receive lapatinib bortezomib . Investigators want study marker inside tumor may relate well two medication work . These biopsy require part study .</brief_summary>
