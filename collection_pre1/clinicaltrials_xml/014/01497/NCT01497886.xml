No difference baseline knowledge exist parent assign intervention control arm child assign intervention control arm . Hypothesis 2 . Children intervention arm demonstrate great knowledge immediately three month intervention concern stroke symptom identification response compare control arm . Hypothesis 3 . Compared student Control condition , child intervention arm likely communicate stroke information parent ( assessed 1-week follow-up ) . Hypothesis 4 . In home communication enact , parent school assign intervention arm demonstrate great ability name symptom stroke appropriate action , compare baseline knowledge , 1 week 3 month follow-up , compare parent control arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significance : Stroke lead cause serious long-term adult disability U.S. third lead cause death , 2-fold great incidence Blacks compare majority Americans . Thrombolytic revascularization treatment administer within maximum 3 hour symptom onset reduces morbidity , mortality cost3Í¾ however , 3 % patient arrive hospital within 3 hours,4 mostly due public 's lack knowledge concern stroke symptom , appropriate response recognize , call 911 . The investigator propose reduce delay use novel behavioral intervention improve symptom recognition response high-risk , minority , economically disadvantage population . Despite abundance stroke education material available , study continue reveal severe deficiency stroke literacy ( knowledge symptom , urgent action , prevention measure ) . Expensive mass medium stroke education campaign sustainable purpose , particularly economically disadvantaged population . Instead , investigator propose intervene school classroom child age 9 11 year , teach five cardinal stroke symptom , correct course action occur , highlight potential therapeutic benefit early hospital arrival , intent child educate parent . To help accomplish , investigator develop program call Hip Hop Stroke ( HHS ) , comprise rap song two animate musical cartoon incorporate stroke knowledge . Innovation : Targeting child intervene parent rarely sporadically attempt various content area , intervention use traditional teaching method engage child , little success report . In contrast , HHS intervention design collaboration school-aged child , child 's education television/media expert , well public health expert , school principal , neurologist . As result , target child purpose important innovation , careful development material design appeal . Moreover , investigator note utilizing child `` transmission vector '' carry intervention aim parent potential serve basis intervention number area , example , medication adherence , healthy eat weight loss , treatment diabetes , . Thus , significance propose trial address public health problem study stroke symptom identification response well development refinement general model intervention . Primary Aims . The investigator propose conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) two arm : HHS Intervention control , 14 public school New York City , evaluate effect HHS intervention : 1 . The child 's ' ability name cardinal symptom stroke , recommend action , three month follow end intervention . ( This provide replication first trial ) . 2 . The likelihood child expose HHS intervention communicate , attempt communicate , content one person household . 3 . In home communication occur , parent 's ability name cardinal symptom stroke , recommend action , 1 week 3-months follow end intervention . Secondary Aim : The average annual age-adjusted stroke incidence rate among Blacks New York City ( northern Manhattan ) age &gt; 20 , per 100,000 person 223 , double rate see white . Although incidence stroke high , beyond scope trial provide sufficient statistical power ass effect intervention interval recognition ( whether self otherwise ) arrival emergency room . However , collect follow-up data ( minimum 2year ) observe trend .</detailed_description>
