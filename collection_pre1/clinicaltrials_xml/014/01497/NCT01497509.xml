	<brief_summary>Although intrapartum epidural analgesia frequently implicated adverse breast-feeding outcome , many previous study feature major design limitation preclude widespread applicability finding . Some fail control precise pharmacologic composition epidural infusion , include whether opioid , fentanyl , even use addition local anesthetic whether combined spinal/epidural purely epidural technique use . The drug use epidural infusion different mechanism action lipophilicities also transfer across placenta varying proportion , one study identify umbilical vein/maternal vein ratio 0.94 epidural fentanyl 0.30 bupivacaine , another find significantly different umbilical cord fentanyl concentration among neonate whose mother ' epidural infusion contain &gt; 150 microgram fentanyl , &lt; 150 microgram , none . It also possible total dose epidural fentanyl could affect neonate differently depend upon time course administer - namely , whether fentanyl include initial epidural bolus subsequent infusion solely infusion . In two study , mean umbilical vein concentration fentanyl correlate total epidural infusion time , featured sample size few 30 , necessitate research . Another limitation previous study define success solely time cessation breast-feeding . Questionnaires mailed mother month even year postpartum may generate unreliable data . If epidural medication truly mediate physiologic effect upon breast-feeding , optimal study period immediately post-delivery , specifically drug clear maternal neonatal circulation . After hospital discharge , many new factor - mother 's need return work lack social support - begin confound picture breast-feeding success . Full-time employment outside home significantly associate decreased likelihood breast-feeding 6 month postpartum . Some study also fail control intent breast-feed time hospital admission , number infant previously breast-fed , labor duration . Failure account oxytocin augmentation labor also problematic , intravenous intrapartum oxytocin infusion show decrease woman 's endogenous serum oxytocin concentration second day postpartum dose-dependent fashion , subsequently impair milk release , thus , decrease breast-feeding success . Epidural analgesia may worsen breast-feeding outcome attenuate neonatal exhibition neurobehaviors tie feeding , suck , root , swallow , immediate postpartum period . This critical period mother baby make first attempt breast-feeding set precedent subsequent interaction . Neonatal feed behavior early postpartum period important predictor long-term breast-feeding success ; baby fee vigorously first day life significantly likely still breast-feeding 3 6 month exhibit less degree breast-feeding enthusiasm . Radzyminski et al . find significant dose-response relationship either epidural bupivacaine fentanyl regard neonatal feeding behavior , Porter et al . find significant effect epidural fentanyl , mean dose 184 microgram , upon neonatal APGAR score , incidence respiratory depression , NACS score ( Neurologic Adaptive Capacity Scores ) 2 24 hour post-delivery . Beilin et al . find neonatal NACS score significantly low mother ' epidural infusion contain great 150 microgram total epidural fentanyl contain bupivacaine . In randomized , control , double-blinded study , investigate whether intrapartum epidural fentanyl significantly decrease likelihood breast-feeding hospital discharge increase incidence neonatal deficit latch breast audibly swallow first three hour life . We hypothesize effect dose-dependent relation time course epidural fentanyl administer . We also investigate whether oxytocin augmentation labor decrease amount skin-to-skin contact first hour life associate significantly decrease breast-feeding rate hospital discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrapartum Epidural Fentanyl Breastfeeding Immediate Postpartum Period : Randomized , Controlled , Double-blinded Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NACS score specifically measure feed behavior , rather five general area adaptive capacity , passive tone , active tone , primary reflex , alertness/crying/motor activity . Conversely , Preterm Infant Breastfeeding Behavior Scale ( PIBBS ) specifically examine neonatal rooting , latching , suck , swallow behavior well general activity level , thus produce comprehensive picture breast-feeding interaction . Beilin et al . previously perform randomize , control , double-blinded study multiparous woman randomize receive intrapartum epidural analgesia contain , addition bupivacaine , either great 150 microgram total fentanyl , less 150 microgram , zero . This study several limitation . Breast-feeding difficulty assess 24 hour postpartum , long neonate would expect fully metabolize drug . Like previous study , Beilin et al . also control skin-to-skin mother-infant contact . According prospective cohort study 21,842 mother 19 hospital , likelihood exclusive breast-feeding throughout hospital stay positively , significantly correlate number minute skin-to-skin contact first three hour postpartum , even control intention breast-feed time hospital admission . Another randomize , control , double-blinded study find significant difference regard breast-feeding initiation breast-feeding rate 12 month postpartum among woman receive bupivacaine-only epidural analgesia , combine spinal-epidural analgesia mean fentanyl dose 107.3 microgram , epidural infusion mean fentanyl dose 162.8 microgram . All fentanyl administer part continuous infusion never initial bolus , potentially different effect result large loading dos fentanyl compare gradual infusion could study . The author objectively measure neonatal feeding behavior , rely solely upon maternal interview 24-48 hour post-delivery , study nulliparous woman . In pilot study 310 mother deliver University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( Cleveland , Ohio ) September 2009 February 2010 , find duration epidural infusion significantly correlate decreased neonatal ability successfully latch onto breast audibly swallow first three hour life . All infusion contain identical dos fentanyl bupivacaine .</detailed_description>
