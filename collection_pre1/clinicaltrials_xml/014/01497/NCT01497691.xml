	<brief_summary>Previous investigation anecdotal experience show safety utility Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation/Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure ( NIPPV/BiPAP ) treatment asthma child . If NIPPV/BiPAP show beneficial effect child respiratory insufficiency , emergency department ICU stay may shorten , need invasive dangerous airway procedure may decrease . This would result change standard care asthma treatment emergency department . The investigator hypothesis use new NIPPV , conjunction current standard care therapy , acute moderate severe asthma exacerbation lead rapid improvement patient ventilation , fast resolution respiratory distress , overall improve secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
