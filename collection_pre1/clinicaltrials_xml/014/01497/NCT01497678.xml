	<detailed_description>Loss musculotendinous tissue result trauma inevitably lead severe morbidity subject surgical challenge caregiver . The reconstruction tissue follow injury often possible surgical option extremely limited . Amputation affect limb uncommon outcome . Free muscle graft , pedicle graft , use prosthetic material attempt primary repair possible due loss tissue domain . The result effort typically dishearten . If autologous graft use , donor site morbidity compound post surgical problem resultant diminish quality life . Stated differently , exist treatment option treatment loss large amount skeletal muscle tissue scar extremely limited exist tendon structure damage lack strength . A Repair Reinforcement approach biocompatible device would represent paradigm shift treatment traumatic tissue injury . This approach involve release scar tissue constricts movement exist tendon , repair damage tendon musculotendinous unit suture repair , reinforce repair biologic scaffold material . The biologic scaffold compose animal derive collagen approve FDA device reinforcement soft tissue repair suture suture anchor , tendon repair surgery . '' Additionally , list FDA 510k approval , device '' provide remodelable scaffold replace subject 's soft tissue . '' These biologic material fall category implantable device know extracellular matrix ( ECM ) compose protein surround cellular element mammal . No living cell find ECM implantable device . ECM device make many commercial manufacturer use variety reconstructive surgical procedure year . Because ECM implant becomes populate subject cell blood vessel , repair may stronger new tissue grow within device could possibly contribute improved function augment tendon structure allow ingrowth adjacent muscle fiber . The objective study assess mechanical strength function subject undergo Musculotendinous Tissue Unit Repair Reinforcement ( MTURR ) use biologic scaffold restoration mechanical strength function subject . This study formally evaluate heal return function extracellular matrix device implantation 40 male female subject participate 4-5 military sty suffer injury loss skeletal muscle tissue . The University Pittsburgh Department Plastic Surgery Coordinating Center multi-site study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients follow characteristic eligible participate study : Age : 18 70 year age able provide inform consent Civilian , current former military personnel eligible participate Have suffer injury result structural deficit minimum 20 % muscle group mass functional deficit minimum 25 % compare contralateral limb ; bilateral injury present extremity , potential surgical extremity compare normal expect value sample population similar age gender , evidence remain tendon musculotendinous unit could surgically repair suture . Injuries may encompass single muscle belly compartment . Whether area expect repaired suture determine image study physical examination . Have suffer traumatic injury within last 18 month upper and/or low extremity ; Target 18 month less subject 's may enrol injury outside range principal investigator determines viable muscle injure compartment determine clinical exam image study . Eligible study procedure 3 month post injury stability determine Principal Investigator and/ MD CoInvestigator Willing able comply follow examination , radiographic study , physical therapy , muscle biopsy laboratory test . Patients follow characteristic exclude participate study : Inability provide inform consent Poor nutrition ( demonstrate abnormal lab range serum Albumin PreAlbumin value ) Chronic disease congestive heart failure , liver disease , renal disease , diabetes Active unstable disease state infection anywhere body per MD 's evaluation determination ( demonstrate state medical record history abnormal lab range CBC Differential Platelet , chemistry panel value ) Known coagulopathy ( demonstrate state medical record history diagnosis ) Pregnancy ( demonstrate positive result urine pregnancy test ) Diagnosis cancer within last 12 month /or actively receive chemotherapy radiation treatment Axis I diagnosis DSMIV ( e.g. , Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder ) . Subjects find stable medication receive psychiatric clearance could eligible study participation per Physician 's discretion Subjects complete muscle/tendon gap great 5 cm obvious image study unlikely reasonably repaired suture reinforcement , exclude .</criteria>
