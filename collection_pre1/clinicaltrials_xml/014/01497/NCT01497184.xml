	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn researcher successfully safely give HSCT patient infusion white blood cell ( call T-cells ) genetically change . The process change DNA ( genetic material cell ) T-cells call `` gene transfer . '' Researchers want learn genetically-changed T-cells effective attacking cancer cell patient advance B-cell lymphoma leukemia , receive standard allogeneic HSCT . Researchers want find high dose special T-cells give safely leukemia lymphoma patient . Researchers also want learn long change T-cells stay body , add standard transplant improve respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infusion Allogeneic CD19-Specific T Cells From Peripheral Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gene Transfer : Gene transfer involve draw blood transplant donor , separate T-cells use machine . Researchers perform gene transfer change T-cells ' DNA , inject change T-cells body patient receive transplant . This process call modify donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 4 study arm , base age , treatment schedule , disease status : - Participants Arm 1 receive T-cells vein 6-12 week stem cell transplant . ( Adults participant ) - Participants Arm 2 receive T-cells vein , point , disease come back stem cell transplant . Your doctor may decide need receive chemotherapy give T-cells , order clear T-cells body already . This may help infuse T-cells work well . If chemotherapy need , sign another informed consent document , chemotherapy risk detail . ( Pediatric adult participant eligible ) - Participants Arm 3 receive T-cells vein 6-12 week stem cell transplant . ( Pediatric participant [ age 1-17 ] ) - Participants Arm 4 give T-cells scheduled infusion disease come back . This group also schedule receive stem cell transplant mismatch family member donor . ( Pediatric adult participant eligible ) Once assign study arm , assign 1 4 dose level genetically-changed T-cells , base join study . The first group participant receive low dose T-cells , new group receive high dose change T-cells group , long intolerable side effect see . Chemotherapy HSCT : After donor 's stem cell successfully collect , admit hospital receive chemotherapy HSCT . These procedure consider part research study . You discuss procedure study doctor sign inform consent document specific detail HSCT procedure possible risk , another time . The T-cell Infusion : After HSCT , study chair decide eligible T-cell infusion . You must least 42 day past transplant without serious evidence active graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD occur donor cell attack cell person receive transplant . Before infusion , receive drug low risk allergic reaction T-cells . Tylenol® ( acetaminophen ) give mouth , Benadryl® ( diphenhydramine ) may give mouth vein minute . The T-cell infusion give vein , usually 15-30 minute . During infusion , vital sign check . The infusion may give one day , may divide two part least 24 hour apart . The first part infusion much small part ensure immediate side effect . Before T cell infusion , receive drug low risk allergic reaction T cell . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol® ) give mouth , diphenhydramine ( Benadryl® ) give vein minute . If cancer return transplant , may receive additional T-cell infusion . If receive additional T-cell infusion , screen test repeat . The study doctor discus result repeat screening test . If screening test show eligible receive additional T-cell infusion , treatment option discuss . Study Tests : Within 3 day T-cell infusion , 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 8 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month T-cell infusion , follow test perform : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon time ) drawn research test check level infuse T-cells measure number B-cells ( non-transplanted ) T-cells . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test test blood chemistry , blood sugar . During 4 week , 8 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month visit , part blood sample use test certain protein level . During Month 3 visit , part blood sample use check HAMA immune system reaction . If leave study Month 3 visit , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may collect HAMA immune system reaction test , possible . - You check possible reaction treatment , include GVHD graft failure . Graft failure occur donor cell may able grow multiply body . If happens , high risk infection and/or bleed . If number white blood cell get back high enough level within 3 week transplant , blood stem cell stem cell donor may give . - You may need skin biopsy endoscopy check GVHD and/or graft failure , well . To collect skin biopsy , biopsy area numb anesthetic , small amount skin collect use needle scalpel . An endoscopy exam mildly sedate allow thin , flexible , lighted tube , call endoscope , insert inside esophagus , stomach , first part small intestine . This allow doctor look abnormal area might easily see x-ray . Within 3 month T-cell infusion , CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy check status disease . An extra sample bone marrow aspirate ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn research test whenever bone marrow aspirate/biopsy do possible . These sample use research test study immune system respond infusion T-cells . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Length Study : You may continue take part study 3 month . You take study disease get bad , infection , intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete plan study visit 3 month T-cell infusion . Retreatment : If take study disease get bad , may able enroll study high tolerate dose T-cells found . If happens , follow schedule dosing study test describe . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require patient receive infusion stem cell treat gene transfer procedure must long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . This investigational study . The gene transfer DLI ( infusion genetically-changed T-cells ) commercially available FDA approve use type disease . Their use study consider investigational . The donor 's leukapheresis procedure collect cell manufacture change T-cells provide cost study . Up 140 patient ( 140 donor ) take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
