	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial evaluate ACTIVE memory training intervention ACTIVE speed process train waitlist , no-contact control condition . Specific aims hypothesis : Aim 1 : Evaluate acceptability usefulness ACTIVE memory intervention among Breast Cancer Survivors ( BCS ) . Hypothesis 1 : BCS assign memory intervention arm perceive intervention acceptable useful BCS assign attention control condition . Aim 2 : Establish preliminary efficacy ACTIVE memory training intervention relative attention control no-contact control condition . Hypothesis 2 : Memory training result great memory enhancement immediately post 2-months post-intervention relative attention control no-contact control condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Memory deficit prevalent , bothersome , potentially debilitate symptom million breast cancer survivor ( BCS ) . Evidence-based treatment difficult little intervention research area . Memory training may viable treatment option BCS need . Therefore , purpose study examine acceptability , usefulness , preliminary efficacy memory train intervention Advanced Cognitive Training Vital Elderly ( ACTIVE ) trial , large control trial cognitive intervention behavioral science . The memory training intervention compare attention control no-contact control group . Specific aim ( 1 ) evaluate acceptability usefulness memory intervention BCS ( 2 ) establish preliminary efficacy ACTIVE memory training intervention relative attention control no-contact control condition . Acceptability usefulness assess self-report . Memory assess objective neuropsychological test . A total 108 eligible BCS randomize memory training , attention control , no-contact control . A blinded trained tester perform data collection neuropsychological test three time point : baseline prior intervention , immediately post-intervention , 2 month post-intervention . Findings provide information acceptability , usefulness , preliminary efficacy ACTIVE memory training intervention memory performance BCS . Positive result lead large , full-scale study determine efficacy memory training intervention BCS . Nursing interventional research area vital development evidence-based intervention address memory deficit BCS .</detailed_description>
