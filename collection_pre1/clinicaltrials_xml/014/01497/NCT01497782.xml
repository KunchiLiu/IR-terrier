	<brief_summary>With worldwide proliferation simulation center , essential explore optimal set laparoscopic train investigate different learning approach , e.g . self-directed approach . Therefore , researcher investigate follow randomize controlled trial : impact instructor feedback vs. independent , self-directed approach training complex operational task laparoscopic virtual reality simulator . The study hypothesis instructor feedback pivotal effect surgical skill train virtual reality simulator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The FEEDBACK Trial , Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For virtual reality ( VR ) simulation benefit clear ; drawback less clear . Throughout last decade several study find positive effect learn curve well improvement basic psychomotor skill operate room VR training . VR simulator offer standardize reproducible laparoscopic task , range simple basic skill train full procedure cholecystectomy salpingectomy . Despite well-established advantage VR simulator , majority surgical gynecological department encounter hurdle implement form training surgical education . This mainly due lack knowledge concern time human resources/cost need train novice surgeon adequate level . This randomized trial investigate whether instructor feedback pivotal trainee train operational task ( laparoscopic salpingectomy ) VR simulator . The VR simulator use trial LapSim Surgical Science , Sweden . Instructor feedback consist standardized feedback ten minute maximum three optional feedback session ; trainee ( intervention group ) decide self want feedback session . The trainee control group intervention group reach predefined proficiency level VR simulator within 8 week 3-hour training session time . Furthermore , trial focus different learn approach , e.g . self-directed approach independent approach . The randomization process take place central unit ; Copenhagen Trial Unit , Denmark . Stratification variable : 1 ) Gender 2 ) Computer game experience ( le 20 hour annually )</detailed_description>
