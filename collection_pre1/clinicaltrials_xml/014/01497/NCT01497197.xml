	<brief_title>A Trial Compare Efficacy Safety Ovarian Stimulation With GONAL-f® Luveris® Starting Day 1 Versus Day 6 Women Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject complete screen assessment fulfil eligibility criterion start down-regulation treatment day 21-22 cycle . Down-regulation treatment must start within 2 month follow screen visit . The routine long luteal phase protocol Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist treatment follow . Once down-regulation confirmed , pregnancy test perform within 1 week prior start Recombinant human follicle stimulate hormone ( r-hFSH ) treatment rule pre-existing pregnancy . If result negative , subject randomly assign one two treatment arm trial : - GONAL-f® ( Liquid Pen ; 300 IU per day ) stimulation day 1-5 follow Luveris® ( vial/powder , 150 IU per day ) stimulation Day 1 require r-hCG level meet . The dose adjusted stimulation Day 6 ( increase decrease ) base upon subject 's ovarian response accord center 's standard practice . - GONAL-f® ( Liquid Pen ; 300 IU per day ) stimulation Day 1-5 add Luveris® ( vial/powder , 150 IU per day ) stimulation Day 6 require recombinant Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( r-hCG ) level meet . The dose adjusted stimulation Day 6 ( increase decrease ) base upon subject 's ovarian response accord center 's standard practice . Randomization across two treatment arm keep balanced 1:1 ratio . Subjects provide subject diary ( include r-hCG Crinone® administration safety information ) record daily dose information GONAL-f® Luveris® . Follicular development monitor accord center 's standard practice US and/or Oestradiol ( E2 ) level , protocol r-hCG requirement meet ( i.e. , least 1 follicle great equal 18 mm 2 follicle great equal 16 millimeter [ mm ] ) . After , single injection 250 microgram ( mcg ) r-hCG ( Ovidrel®/Ovitrelle® ) , administer order induce final oocyte maturation . At time 34-38 hour r-hCG administration , oocytes recover vaginally US monitoring . Oocytes fertilized vitro embryo replace 2-3 day oocyte recovery . Ovum pick ( OPU ) , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , Embryo Transfer ( ET ) luteal support perform per center 's standard practice . In addition , Crinone® 8 % ( progesterone gel ) administer daily . A post-treatment safety visit perform subject receive r-hCG ( pregnant non-pregnant ) post r-hCG Day 15-20 . For subject withdraw treatment ( i.e . start Luveris® GONAL f® r-hCG give ) visit take place 20-30 day first Luveris® GONAL-f® treatment injection ( exclude pregnancy test ) .</detailed_description>
