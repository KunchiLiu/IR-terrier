	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine B type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level use predict hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) . This peptide produce ventricle heart stress , ductus remain open . If use simple inexpensive blood test determine whether PDA need treat , potentially treat infant sooner need wait availability cardiologist perform echocardiogram . This might decrease deleterious effect PDAs preterm infant bronchopulmonary dysplasia , necrotizing enterocolitis , renal hypoperfusion , pulmonary hemorrhage . In situation follow echocardiogram course medical therapy show persistent PDA , test may help decide whether baby need treatment , either medical surgical .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do Elevated BNP Levels Predict Hemodynamically Significant PDAs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) mainly synthesize ventricle heart release response volume pressure load ventricular stress , therefore , play important role regulation extracellular fluid volume . BNP cause diuresis , natriuresis , arterial venous vasodilation antagonize renin-angiotensin system result reduction intravascular volume decrease ventricular preload afterload . In adult , BNP level routinely use diagnose measure degree congestive heart failure . In healthy term infant , BNP level initially elevate first day life decline ensue week birth near adult level 3 month age . However , premature newborn infant still normative value BNP , therefore , agreed-upon cut point diagnose ventricular overload without confirmatory echocardiography . Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) common cause ventricular overload congestive heart failure premature neonates cause significant morbidity . Excessive pulmonary blood flow due aortopulmonary shunt result increase ventilatory dependency thereby contribute chronic lung disease . Other possible sequela PDA include renal hypoperfusion , necrotizing entercolitis , pulmonary hemorrhage . Early closure PDA show reduce risk . Delayed ductal closure inversely related GA birth incidence vary 20 % baby great 32 week gestation 60 % baby le 28 week gestation . Currently , infant screen PDA echocardiography . This require center access cardiologist perform analyze study . A simple blood test could help diagnose hemodynamically significant PDA would extremely helpful low birth weight infant , especially remote center routine access cardiology service . To date , accept blood test although numerous study emerge suggest BNP might test . It show magnitude shunt PDA major determinant BNP level , however , level publish various study hemodynamically significant varies greatly . In addition , study do previously small sample size ( less 70 patient , one retrospective study 88 patient ) various gestational age , therefore , difficult extrapolate normative data . It already know BNP level elevate neonate hsPDA , however , little agreement high BNP level need get imply hsPDA . We propose study measure BNP value infant bear less 32 week gestation without PDA . We also serial BNP level concurrent echocardiograms infant PDA determine cutoff value BNP infant likely hsPDA . We hope study , large sample size infant without PDA , able gather definitive data cutoff BNP level , also gather normative BNP data premature infant without PDAs .</detailed_description>
