	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see combination ofatumumab high dose methylprednisolone follow additional treatment ofatumumab lenalidomide help people relapse refractory CLL/SLL get rid CLL/SLL long period time . Researchers also want find combination ofatumumab methylprednisolone follow additional treatment ofatumumab lenalidomide safe tolerable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab/Methylprednisolone Followed Ofatumumab/Lenalidomide Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single institution , non-randomized study patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL , utilize two-stage trial design . The primary endpoint trial combine complete partial response rate 3 month ( end cycle 3 ) protocol therapy . Investigators anticipate trial complete response partial response ( CR+PR ) rate least 55 % . A two-stage design employ trial . The null/unacceptable CR+PR response rate ≤35 % anticipated true response rate protocol treatment least 55 % disease cohort . At first stage , 25 patient accrue trial . If 9 few patient respond , trial terminate early response rate protocol treatment deem unacceptable ( ≤35 % ) . Otherwise , 9 patient respond first stage , additional 31 patient enrolled trial stage 2 total 56 patient . If 25 few 56 patient respond protocol treatment end stage 2 , investigation protocol treatment consider warrant . On hand , 25 patient 56 enrolled patient respond , protocol treatment consider promising . If true response rate ≤35 % , probability end trial stage 1 0.63 . If , however , true response rate least 55 % , probability end trial stage 1 0.04 . This two-stage design overall alpha level 0.047 power 0.90 . For purpose interim analysis end stage 1 , objective response measure end 3 month ( end cycle 3 ) start protocol treatment prior initiation combination ofatumumab lenalidomide . The accrual suspend wait result interim analysis unless observed objective response rate among patient whose objective response data available 30 % .</detailed_description>
