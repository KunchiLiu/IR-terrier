	<brief_summary>Background : - Essential tremor ( ET ) condition out-of-control shaking . Several drug use treat ET . However , often partly helpful side effect . Many people ET get relief drinking alcohol . Octanol , food additive similar alcohol , improve tremor animal less likely make people feel drunk . One form octanol , call 1-octanol , show improve tremor people side effect . 1-octanol converted octanoic acid , research suggest octanoic acid might suppress ET significant side effect drunkenness . Researchers want see dose octanoic acid useful reduce ET . Objectives : - To test different dos octanoic acid treat essential tremor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 21 year age ET respond treatment alcohol . - Participants must able stop take certain ET medication study . Design : - This study require three visit . Visit 1 screen visit take 5 hour . Visit 2 2- 3-day inpatient admission National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Visit 3 followup outpatient visit 1 2 week hospital admission . - At screen visit , participant physical exam , neurological exam , medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Participants also alcohol dose test measure tremor response alcohol . - For study visit , participant enter hospital testing . Participants study drug test tremor 's response . Frequent blood sample collect . - One two week leave hospital , participant final followup study visit . Blood sample collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To determine maximum tolerate dose oral octanoic acid ( OA ) patient essential tremor . Further study objective include evaluation efficacy tolerability octanoic acid escalation dos , well pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile . STUDY POPULATION : Up 30 subject ethanol-responsive essential tremor ( ET ) include study . Subjects recruit group 6 per dose level . DESIGN : The study objective test use 3+3 dose escalation design . Per dose level , 3 subject recruit , dose level 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 mg/kg , additional 3 subject level one three subject exhibit dose limit toxicity . Subjects undergo screen visit , follow 2 3-day inpatient admission study drug OA administer . An outpatient follow-up visit conclude study . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure evaluate dose-limiting toxicity , reach 2 subject exhibit grade 2 adverse event ( CTCAE ) dose-level , related OA . The dose level 2 grade 2 OA-related adverse event observe , define maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) study stop . Toxicity primary outcome monitor unblinded independent data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) , determine primary outcome reach . Secondary measure include safety measure routine laboratory parameter , EKG measure , vital sign well standardized assessment sign intoxication . Additional secondary outcome measure include efficacy measure tremor accelerometry digital spiral analysis , well standardized clinical tremor rating scale . Furthermore , pharmacokinetic sampling perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis essential tremor bilateral hand tremor predominant feature , know responsive ethanol . Unequivocal accelerometric tremor hand screen examination ( bilateral central tremor component postural tremor accelerometry , consistent ET ) Reduction accelerometric tremor power least 35 % follow formal ethanol challenge screen visit . Subjects must willing safely able abstain medication treatment tremor period least 5 plasma halflives individual drug prior study participation . ( For Propranolol/Inderal , Gabapentin/Neurontin 1 day ; Primidone/Mysoline : 26 day ) . Subjects must willing refrain alcohol drink food contain caffeine start 48 hour prior study visit EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients significant pathological find neurological examination typical symptom ET Acute chronic severe medical condition would preclude subject participating ( e.g. , severe heart disease NYHA grade 3 4 , renal failure , hepatic failure , lung disease , uncontrolled hyperthyroidism ) Subjects concomitant therapy warfarin NSAIDs ( aspirin ) , take regular basis discontinue least 14 day prior study participation , potential interaction octanoic acid ( displacement albumin bind human serum ) ( Noctor et al . 1992 ) Established diagnosis diabetes mellitus , fastingperiods 12 hour require protocol . Subjects active past alcohol abuse dependence ( AUDIT score great equal 8 ) Elevated liver function parameter ( AST , ALT , GGT ) , high 1.5 fold upper limit normal range ( define NIH Clinical Center Laboratory Medicine Department ) , clinically significant abnormality baseline laboratory test . The limit AST therefore 51 U/l , ALT 62 U/L , GGT 128 U/l . Female subject pregnant breastfeed Subjects age &lt; 21 year Known flush symptom alcohol intake allergy alcohol ( yes answer standardized Alcohol Flushing Questionnaire )</criteria>
