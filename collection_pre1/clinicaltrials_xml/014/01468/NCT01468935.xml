	<brief_summary>Background : - Some transplant recipient find cell uterus come donor . Researchers want study uterine tissue three different group woman : ( 1 ) healthy volunteer , ( 2 ) people stem cell transplant , ( 3 ) people rare diseases condition affect reproduction . These sample help researcher learn way stem cell work reproductive tract . Objectives : - To collect cell uterus study stem cell work reproductive tract . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test . - Participants endometrial biopsy collect cell study . The biopsy visit take 1 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transplantation hematopoietic cell use wide variety blood disorder , also diseases like solid organ cancer . Interestingly , woman bone marrow transplant find donor tissue endometrium , raise possibility cellular therapy use bone marrow derive cell gynecologic indication . Donor engraftment appear occur transplantation perform stem cell collect peripheral blood donor . Therefore , subtype cell bone marrow responsible engraftment yet know , ideal transplantation regimen know . The immediate aim tissue procurement protocol obtain endometrial ( uterine ) stem cell many human volunteer order examine biological property cell . We collect tissue 3 primary group patient : normal control , patient rare disease reproductive disorder , patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Each volunteer undergo endometrial biopsy office visit . The endometrial tissue study well understanding biological property , growth differentiation . One specific area interest study hematopoietic transplantation impact endometrial cell function . These endometrial cell analyze in-depth laboratory determine come donor recipient , , specific population cell . Hematologic pre-transplant conditioning information correlate research study identify factor may assist understand adult endometrial stem cell biology .</detailed_description>
