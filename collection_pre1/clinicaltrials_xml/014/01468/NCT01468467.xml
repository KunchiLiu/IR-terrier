	<brief_title>A Study AC220 Given After Transplant Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part , sequential group dose escalation study . In Part 1 , subject enrol successive cohort determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Dose escalation decision make base dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) occur subject treated date give dose level . In Part 2 , confirmation cohort open confirm safety MTD . Subjects allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) enter treatment AC220 30 60 day receive allogeneic HSCT . AC220 administer every day , 28 consecutive day define treatment cycle . Subjects may receive 24 continuous treatment cycle . Subjects study visit week first 2 cycle , Day 1 cycle .</detailed_description>
