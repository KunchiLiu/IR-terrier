	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical trial compare effect different direct pulp cap method human pulpal response term inflammation &amp; dentinal bridge formation . Methods : Eight patient provide 32 sound first premolars select . As recommended ISO / TC 7405 pulpal exposure perform class I cavity . Four group eight specimen define accord pulp cap method . Group A , receive chemical set calcium hydroxide ( Dycal ) . Group B , receive mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( MTA ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . Group C , receive MTA primary setting , within 15 minute , cavity restore appointment . Group D , receive Multical direct pulp cap agent . Specimens assess term dentinal bridge formation , appearance compare natural dentin , thickness inflammatory pulpal response . The last item score 0-3 0 corresponds none , 1 minimal , 2 moderate 3 severe inflammation . In case abscess true tissue necrosis , score 4 give recommend ISO / TC 7405 .</detailed_description>
