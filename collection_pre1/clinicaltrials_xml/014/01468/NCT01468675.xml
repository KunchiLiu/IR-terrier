	<brief_summary>Growing evidence understanding inherit component several common , chronic disease lead increase importance information family health history , integration information risk factor common disease , like lifestyle risk factor . The US Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) recommend use family health history routine genetic screening test common disease , obtain complete family health history first step identify patient need intervention ( e.g. , intensive screening , lifestyle modification , preventative therapy , genetic counseling ) . The importance integrate family health history individual 's medical record increase understand genome evolves essential put detail personal genetic information clinical context . Because limited time typical primary care visit , concern primary care provider ( PCPs ) self-efficacy estimate provide guidance risk , PCPs frequently obtain family health history provide individualize risk assessment . These issue highlight need leverage technology collect data independent clinic visit , yet data interoperate individual 's electronic health record ( EHR ) . Telephonic interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) self-administered web-based tool low-cost , sustainable way reach primary care population , independent visit . We propose develop , implement , evaluate patient-reported , EHR-integrated personalize risk assessment module provide tailor disease risk risk reduction information . The Specific Aims propose project : Aim 1 : Develop patient-reported , EHR-integrated , personalize risk assessment module provide tailor disease risk risk reduction information four common disease ( breast cancer , colorectal cancer , coronary heart disease , type II diabetes ) patient his/ PCP . Aim 2 : Measure reach effectiveness integrate risk assessment module conduct cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) adult primary care patient Brigham Women 's Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network . Aim 3 : Evaluate facilitator barrier adoption implementation integrate risk assessment module . This project understand technology use fill gap current clinical practice facilitate systematic collection family health history lifestyle risk factor data integrate data individual 's EHR personalize care variety setting diverse patient population . This work use current national data standard interoperability , lesson learn project exportable healthcare setting throughout United States .</brief_summary>
