	<brief_summary>Background : - Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) highly treatable cancer . However , HL respond chemotherapy return chemotherapy , treatment often successful . - Some HL cell molecule call CD25 surface . Daclizumab drug detect CD25 cell . In treatment study HL respond chemotherapy , daclizumab plus radioactive atom call Yttrium 90 help kill HL cell . Researchers want combine 90Y daclizumab high-dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant . This treatment may effective daclizumab alone . Objectives : - To see yttrium-90 daclizumab , high-dose chemotherapy , stem cell transplant treat HL respond earlier treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age Hodgkin lymphoma respond chemotherapy . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test . - Participants filgrastim plerixafor move stem cell blood . Stem cell collect apheresis . - Four week stem cell collect , participant 90Y daclizumab normal daclizumab treat HL . Chemotherapy start 9 day first treatment . - Most participant second dose 90Y daclizumab 6 week first dose . - After daclizumab treatment , participant several image study chest abdomen . Blood sample also collect . - On day last day chemotherapy , participant receive stem cell collect earlier . Filgrastim injection help stimulate stem cell growth ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Although Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) consider highly treatable cancer , patient relapse chemotherapy refractory disease represent major therapeutic challenge . - Only 30-65 % relapsed patient achieve long-term disease free survival current standard care high-dose chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) . - The malignant Reed-Sternberg cell HL surround benign T cell infiltrates often express CD25 , high affinity interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R alpha ) . - In study NCI-97-C-0110 , treat 30 patient CD25-expressing relapsed refractory HL radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) use ( 90 ) Y-labeled daclizumab ( anti-CD25 ) , achieve 63 % response rate include 12 complete response serious adverse event MDS 4 patient . - We propose integrate ( 90 ) Y-labeled daclizumab RIT induction regimen ASCT effort improve response disease-free survival relapse refractory HL . Objectives : Phase I Primary Objectives : - To assess safety adverse event associate ( 90 ) Y-daclizumab ( humanize anti-CD25 ) radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) combination high-dose BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , [ Ara-C , cytosine arabinoside ] melphalan ) chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) patient relapse refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) adverse prognostic factor . - To determine maximum tolerate dose mCi ( 90 ) Y-daclizumab RIT combination high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ASCT patient relapse refractory HL . Phase II Primary Objectives : - To assess frequency failure engraft , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , secondary leukemia development abnormal bone-marrow cytogenetics refractory relapse HL patient treat ( 90 ) Y-daclizumab RIT combination high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ASCT . - To estimate response rate ( number complete partial response ) patient refractory relapse HD ( 90 ) Y-daclizumab RIT administer combination high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ASCT . Eligibility : - Patients must confirm diagnosis relapse refractory HL least 10 % malignant Reed-Sternberg cell infiltrate T-cells express CD25 ( IL-2R alpha ) . A . Patients must least one following : ( 1 ) initial relapse le 12 month achieve CR primary chemotherapy HL ; ( 2 ) Staged III/IV diagnosis ; ( 3 ) exhibit chemotherapy resistant disease ( 4 ) achieve CR cytoreductive chemotherapy prior plan transplant . B . Patient must lesion least 1.0 cm great diameter . C. Patients lymphocyte predominant HL exclude . D. Patients pre-existing MDS marrow cytogenic abnormality eligible participate . - Omission cytotoxic chemotherapy systemic therapy HL least 4 week prior entry trial . - No prior ASCT allogeneic stem cell transplant . Design : - A single institution non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial . - Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) mobilization granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF , filgrastim ) Plerixafor follow apheresis collect target dose 4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg ( minimal dose 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ) actual body weight . - Phase I study carry use standard 3 + 3 cohort dose-escalation design : - Dose level 1 : Patients receive single dose 15 mCi 90Y-daclizumab RIT ( day -15 2 day ) follow high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ( begin Day -6 ) ASCT ( Day 0 ) . - Dose level 2-7 : Patients receive two dos 90Y-daclizumab RIT 6 week apart ( Day -56 -15 2 day ) follow high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ( begin day -6 ) ASCT ( Day 0 ) . The first dose 90Y-daclizumab fix 15 mCi . The second dose escalate 15 mCi increment 15 mCi maximum tolerate dose , exceed 90 mCi . - Phase II : All patient receive two dos 90Y-daclizumab ( Day -56 -15 2 day ) follow high-dose BEAM chemotherapy ( begin Day -6 ) ASCT ( Day 0 ) . The first dose RIT 15 mCi . The second dose maximum tolerate dose determined phase I . 111In-daclizumab ( 5 mCi ) imaging may perform concurrently 90Ydaclizumab RIT day 100 ASCT .</detailed_description>
