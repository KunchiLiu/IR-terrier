	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well paclitaxel give together without pazopanib hydrochloride work treat patient ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cavity cancer persistent come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . It yet know whether paclitaxel effective give without pazopanib hydrochloride treat ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With Without Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival hazard ratio combination weekly paclitaxel pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) compare weekly paclitaxel placebo patient persistent recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . II . To estimate compare proportion patient respond therapy Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) response , overall survival ( OS ) , duration response arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore association plasma cytokine angiogenic marker progression-free overall survival . II . To explore association single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) progression-free overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 placebo orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel Arm I pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
