	<detailed_description>The excessive mortality dialysis patient , particularly cardiovascular event , undoubtedly relate large part hypertension cardiac damage ( 1 ) . Most study reveal hypertension persist despite antihypertensive drug . Some author ( Parfrey ) use term `` natural history '' heart disease dialysis , suggest deterioration inevitably link procedure ( 2 ) . In sharp contrast , study ( Charra , Özkahya ) ( 3,4 ) show strict volume control strategy decrease blood pressure ( BP ) without drug , prolongs survival . This suggest volume control insufficient dialysis center , despite fact treat physician may consider `` Dry Weight '' ( DW ) patient reach . In fact , easily applicable method determine extra cellular volume consequently estimate DW . Thus DW clinically define `` trial error '' several indirect method . Recently , device measure DW Bioimpedance spectroscopy ( BİS ) become available . This non-invasive , cheap easily repeatable method potential improve dialysis outcome majority patient world , The aim present project assess feasibility volume control use BİS device compare result conventional way treatment . Conventional way estimate DW ( 5 ) Intradialytic hypotension continue lead problem , especially elderly cardiovascularly compromise patient . This predominance explain fact structural functional abnormality heart blood vessel increase sensitivity patient change fluid status . It cause discomfort , also increase mortality . In recent study , low post-dialytic blood pressure associate significantly increase risk mortality . Therefore prevention intradialytic hypotension , remain important challenge dialysis physician . The occurrence hypotension ultrafiltration ( UF ) necessitate termination UF procedure commonly consider sign DW reach . However , although intradialytic hypotension commonly consider sign hypovolemia , always correct , rapid removal large amount fluid within hour cause temporary state disequilibrium . It show achievement DW volume control fact decrease number hypotensive episode ( 5 ) Therefore , need objective method estimate body fluid volumesThis prospective , randomize , control study aim evaluate usefulness new BCM device method improve volume control dialysis patient compare result obtain conventional volume control modality . To knowledge investigation do elsewhere . The investigator believe propose study produce powerful evidence convince nephrological society need strict volume control strategy use new device BCM hemodialysis patient . The expect data may change routine practice cause achievement normal blood pressure level without use anti-hypertensive medication .</detailed_description>
