	<brief_summary>This study open-label , single-treatment , single-dose , parallel group study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) droxidopa subject mild , moderate , severe renal dysfunction End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) single dose compare match healthy subject normal renal function . A total 48 male female subject , 16 subject normal renal function ( eGFR great 90 mL/min/1.73m² ) eight ( 8 ) mild ( 60 less eGFR less 89 mL/min/1.73m² ) , moderate ( 30 less eGFR less 59 mL/min/1.73m² ) , severe ( 15 less eGFR less 29 mL/min/1.73m² ) renal impairment ESRD ( eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m² require hemodialysis ) select accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The medical laboratory examination take place within 28 day dose . A single dose 600 mg droxidopa investigational drug administer 240 mL water overnight fast ( minimum 10 hour ) . Blood sample measurement plasma concentration droxidopa metabolite include limited 3-OM-DOPS , NE , vanillic acid , protocatechuic acid collect 0 , .5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 30 , 36 hour dose healthy volunteer subject mild , moderate , severe renal impairment ESRD . For latter , sample collect non-hemodialysis hemodialysis visit . During dialysis , sample dialysate , arterial venous side dialyzer collect 30-minute interval dialysis period . In addition , entire dialysate collect , volume record , sample retain measurement droxidopa metabolite include limited 3-OM-DOPS , NE , vanillic acid , protocatechuic acid concentration . Urine sample measurement urinary excretion droxidopa metabolites include limited 3-OM-DOPS , NE , vanillic acid , protocatechuic acid collect follow interval dose : 0 2 , 2-4 , 4-6 , 6-8 , 8-12 , 12-24 , 24-36 hour healthy volunteer subject mild , moderate , severe renal impairment . A post-study visit physical examination laboratory test take place within seven ( 7 ) day last PK blood sampling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Droxidopa ( L-DOPS ) orally administer , synthetic catecholamine convert sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine ( NE ) single step decarboxylation endogenous enzyme 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DOPA ) decarboxylase . Droxidopa originally develop Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. , market Japan since 1989 indication list . - Improvement frozen gait dizziness stand patient Parkinson 's Disease . - Improvement orthostatic hypotension , syncope , dizziness stand patient Shy-Drager syndrome familial amyloid polyneuropathy . - Improvement follow symptom orthostatic hypotension patient undergoing hemodialysis : dizziness , light-headed feeling , dizziness standing , malaise , weakness . Chelsea hypothesizes indication deficiency lack activity adrenergic neurotransmitter NE affect use NE prodrug . In Phase 1 clinical study conduct Japanese Caucasian subject , droxidopa well tolerated difference note oral absorption two group . Apart moderate increase heart rate one Caucasian subject ( receive 600 mg droxidopa ) , consider possibly relate study medication , adverse event ( AEs ) consider related droxidopa treatment . The maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) reach 2 3 hour single , oral dos droxidopa ( 100 900 mg ) . The plasma elimination half-life ( t½ ) droxidopa 1.4 - 1.5 hour approximately 15 % drug recover unchanged urine . No drug accumulation observe multiple oral dosing droxidopa ( 300 mg twice daily 5 day ) . Although therapeutic effect droxidopa believe due conversion droxidopa NE , major metabolite droxidopa methylated droxidopa ( 3-OM-DOPS ) . After administration single 100 mg 300 mg dos healthy volunteer , droxidopa , 3-OM-DOPS , NE observe urine . The 24-hour excretion droxidopa 3-OM-DOPS account approximately 15 % 8 % administer dose ( 3-OM-DOPS uncorrected molecular weight ) , suggest renal function may impact clearance droxidopa 3-OM-DOPS.1,2 A population PK study conduct patient Primary Autonomic Failure indicate increase age associate decreased clearance droxidopa 3 OM DOPS ( Apparent clearance decrease 0.8 % per year age [ reference age 65 year ] ) . Further identify patient 's concurrently take L-Dopa dopamine derivative approximately 50 % clearance see patient take droxidopa . 6 From safety perspective , droxidopa generally well-tolerated across large variety patient population . As precursor NE administer orally , droxidopa expect provide therapy NOH patient autonomic failure associate neurodegenerative disease . The Investigator 's Brochure3 review complete description non clinical clinical experience droxidopa . 2.0 Objectives 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) droxidopa subject mild , moderate , severe renal dysfunction ESRD single oral dose compare match healthy subject normal renal function . The PK parameter Cmax , Tmax , AUC ( inf ) , CL/F , Vz/F , t½ , CLr consider primary parameter evaluation . 2.2 Secondary Objective The secondary objective study assess safety tolerability Droxidopa match healthy subject mild severe renal dysfunction ESRD participant AEs laboratory measure . 3.0 Investigational Plan 3.1 Study Description This study open-label , single-treatment , single-dose , parallel group study evaluate PK droxidopa subject mild , moderate , severe renal dysfunction ESRD single dose compare match healthy subject normal renal function .</detailed_description>
