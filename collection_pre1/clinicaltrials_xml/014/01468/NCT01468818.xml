	<brief_summary>Background : - The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) drug keep white blood cell active . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 200 patient melanoma . - This study use chemotherapy prepare immune system white blood cell treatment . Our prior study indicate aldesleukin may require cell transfer . Objectives : - To see chemotherapy white blood cell therapy without aldesleukin safe effective treatment metastatic melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age less equal 70 year age metastatic melanoma . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient National Institute Health ( NIH ) clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need . - Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . - Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer autologous patient along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - IL-2 administration show increase number T regulatory cell trial find direct relationship number IL-2 dose reconstitution patient one week cluster differentiation 4 + forkhead box P3 ( CD4+ Foxp3 ) + T regulatory cell . - In analysis factor relate ability treatment mediate objective response , find highly significant inverse correlation reconstitution CD4+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cell likelihood achieve objective response . - In prior clinical trial cell transfer use TIL lymphodepletion without 2 ( gray ) Gy total body irradiation , patient experience objective response receive few dos IL-2 compare non-responders ( p=0.007 0.03 respectively ) . - High level homeostatic T cell growth factor , IL-15 , present patient serum lymphodepleting regimen time cell transfer . - These factor raise possibility IL-2 administration require cell transfer . OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective trial determine whether objective response mediate patient metastatic melanoma receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen adoptive transfer young tumor infiltrate lymphocyte IL-2 administration . - The secondary objective involves determination level transfer cell blood persist 1 week 1 month transfer . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm diagnosis metastatic melanoma . - Patients measurable disease , absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . - Patients eligible receive IL-2 . DESIGN : - Patients metastatic melanoma undergo resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture . - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow administration young autologous TIL . - Patients evaluate objective clinical response persistence transfer cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Measurable metastatic melanoma available autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 . Life expectancy great three month Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month receive treatment . Serology : Seronegative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV RNA ) negative . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . Hematology Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) without support filgrastim White blood cell ( WBC ) great equal 3000/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl Chemistry : Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum Creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilberts Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . Six week must elapse since prior antibody therapy include anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody therapy could affect anticancer immune response , time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . NOTE : patient previously receive ipilimumab document gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity must colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . ) Patients must ineligible receive interleukin2 ( IL2 ) base evidence may include ischemic heart disease , arrhythmia , poor ventricular ejection fraction ( &lt; 50 % ) , respiratory compromise ( forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) &lt; 60 % ) , clinically significant patient history judgment investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate aldesleukin . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . Concurrent systemic steroid therapy . History severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction agent use study . Patients ventricular ejection fraction ( less equal 30 % ) , respiratory compromise ( FEV1 le equal 40 % ) .</criteria>
