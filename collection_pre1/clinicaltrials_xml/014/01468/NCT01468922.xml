	<brief_summary>Background : - Pazopanib anticancer drug block growth new blood vessel tumor . It approve treat renal cell cancer . ARQ 197 experimental drug block protein call c-MET , cancer cell need grow . Studies suggest drug block blood vessel growth increase production c-MET tumor , help cancer cell keep grow . Blocking blood vessel growth c-MET pazopanib ARQ 197 may help kill cancer cell faster . This study use drug treat solid tumor respond earlier treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness pazopanib ARQ 197 advance solid tumor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance solid tumor respond earlier treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test , image study . - The study drug give 4-week cycle treatment . Participants take pazopanib day ARQ 197 twice day mouth . Some participant start pazopanib ARQ 197 alone first week . Then take drug together rest study . - Participants monitor frequent blood test image study . Optional tumor sample may collect different treatment cycle ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) signal transduction pathways synergistic effect promote angiogenesis growth factor expression . Hypoxia cause treatment VEGF inhibitor result upregulation c-MET , receptor HGF . In mouse model , combine blockade VEGFR c-Met significantly prolong survival compare inhibition either target alone . - We hypothesize co-administration MET inhibitor ARQ 197 prevent adaptive response hypoxia result treatment VEGFR inhibitor pazopanib , conversely , co-administration pazopanib prevent effect increase VEGF reduce thrombospondin 1 tumor treatment ARQ 197 . Therefore , combination agent may result improved antitumor effect . Objectives : - Establish safety tolerability combination pazopanib ARQ 197 patient refractory advanced solid tumor . - Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination pazopanib ARQ 197 patient refractory advanced solid tumor . - Evaluate change MET phospho-MET follow treatment pazopanib ARQ 197 patient refractory advanced solid tumor . - Determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pazopanib ARQ 197 . - Determine compare level total MET , phospho MET , HIF-1 , epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker ( e-cadherin , beta catenin ) tumor biopsy sample prior follow administration study drug . - Determine compare level circulate level HGF , soluble MET ( sMET ) , VEGF-A , soluble VEGFR2 ( sVEGFR2 ) prior follow administration study drug . - Determine polymorphism CYP2C19 correlate observe toxicity , PK ARQ 197 . - Evaluate antitumor activity combination pazopanib ARQ 197 patient refractory advanced solid tumor . Eligibility : -Adults advance , refractory solid tumor . Patients enrol expansion cohort must advance sarcoma , gastric cancer , MET-expressing malignancy , disease amenable biopsy , willing undergo pre-and post-treatment biopsy . Study Design : - ARQ 197 administer orally twice daily pazopanib orally daily , 28-day cycle . - Dose escalation proceed use traditional 3+3 design . - Once MTD establish , additional cohort accrue pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study tumor biopsy ( required expansion phase ) . For first week , patient receive pazopanib alone compare PK PD result ; combination therapy give week 2 onwards .</detailed_description>
