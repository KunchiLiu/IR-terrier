Although benefit-finding report , provide care spouse love one cancer stressful negative consequence individual psychological physical health . In cancer caregiver , study document negative outcome include symptom fatigue , impaired sleep quality , poor quality life , anxiety depression . These outcome particular concern cancer patient receive intense treatment hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) caregiver embed treatment trajectory extend 4 12 month . In dementia caregiver , additional outcome report include poor health habit impair immunity . In addition , longitudinal study also report caregiver increase risk morbidity mortality , particularly cardiovascular disease . The stress response initiate brain , determine physiological behavioral response event . The normal physiologic response complex dynamic process body respond daily event effort maintain equilibrium . If stress becomes overwhelm individual , either due number magnitude stressor , burden overload lead dysregulation biologic mediator behavioral change ( poor sleep , eat drinking much , smoking , lack physical activity ) exacerbate disease ( e.g . cardiovascular disease ) . A recent study cancer caregiver demonstrate marked change neurohormonal inflammatory process year follow love one cancer diagnosis may place caregiver risk morbidity mortality disease . The relationship among physiologic psychological response well behavioral change stress explore HSCT caregiver . What clear literature caregiving stressful , appear increase one risk morbidity mortality , particularly increase cardiovascular risk . What less clear behavioral , psychological , physiological clinical change associate process caregiver individual undergo allogeneic HSCT , particularly long stressful experience . The purpose exploratory , pilot study threefold : longitudinally examine physiological , behavioral clinical factor HSCT caregiver acute transplant recovery period , compare factor HSCT caregiver non-caregivers , explore association among physiological , psychological , behavioral clinical factor HSCT caregiver . Subjects accrue protocol adult caregiver transplant recipient participate first allogeneic HSCT protocol Clinical Center . An equal sample healthy volunteer non-caregivers recruit serve control subject . A sample 40 subject ( 20 caregiver 20 non-caregiver volunteer ) recruit capture essence experience adequately explore population . Each caregiver participant data collect prior recipient HSCT ( day 0 ) , first week outpatient visit follow recipient initial discharge inpatient setting , finally 6 week post transplant recipient initial discharge hospital . Questionnaires capture psychological behavioral outcome include : Caregiver Reaction Assessment ( caregiver ) , Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II , Perceived Stress Scale , The UCLA Loneliness Scale ( Version 3 ) , General Self-Efficacy Scale , PROMIS Short Forms Anxiety , Depression , Sleep disturbance Fatigue . Clinical variable ( e.g . vital sign ) physiological variable ( e.g . cortisol ) collect along questionnaire clinic visit follow history physical exam Licensed Independent Practitioner ( LIP ) . A sample non-caregivers minimally match age , gender , race/ethnicity , complete study procedure except questionnaire specific caregiver experience ( e.g . caregiver burden ) . There long term follow-up study participation period . Exploratory , hypothesis generating analysis perform use parametric non-parametric technique .</detailed_description>
