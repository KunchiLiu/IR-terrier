	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recurrent glioma patient limit treatment option . A major cause gliomarelated morbidity mortality extensive infiltrative invasive nature glioma cell . Thus , inhibition glioma invasion potentially promising strategy . Work Neuro-Oncology Branch laboratory Dr. Howard Fine identify TrkA important signal receptor mediate glioma cell invasion . Both genetic pharmacological inhibition Trk potently inhibit glioma invasion tumor progression vitro vivo . AZD7451 first in-class inhibitor Trk . OBJECTIVES : To establish maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) continuous twice day AZD7451 dose patient recurrent glioblastoma enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAED ) . To generate pharmacokinetic data continuous twice day AZD7451 dosing . ELIGIBILITY : Patients histologically proven glioblastoma eligible study . Patients fail prior standard treatment radiotherapy . DESIGN : This study accrue 60 evaluable patient . Cohorts 3 6 patient receive continuous AZD7451 twice day orally 28 day . The MTD base tolerability observe first 4 week treatment . Up three patient may enrol simultaneously dose level . The dose AZD7451 progressively escalate 0/3 1/6 patient experience dose limit toxicity prior dose level . At end Cycle 1 , patient may choose continue receive AZD7451 disease progression experience unmanageable drug relate toxicity , long continue derive clinical benefit fulfill criterion removal protocol therapy . Each cycle extension period last 28 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologically prove malignant primary glioma progressive disease radiotherapy eligible protocol . Patients must MRI scan perform within 14 day prior registration fix dose steroid least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline MRI require . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : 1 . Patients eligible four week surgery recover effect surgery . 2 . Residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI do : later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day registration , stable steroid dosage least 5 day . If 96 hour scan 14 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) ( patient deem treat physician cognitively impaired questionably impaired way ability patient give inform consent questionable ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must great equal to18 year old , must life expectancy &gt; 8 week . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AZD7451 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric trial . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 Patients must least 4 week radiation therapy . Additionally , patient must least 6 week nitrosoureas , 4 week temozolomide , 3 week procarbazine , 2 week vincristine 2 week last bevacizumab administration . Patients must least 4 week cytotoxic therapy list 2 week noncytotoxic agent ( e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen ) include investigative agent . With exception alopecia , toxicity prior therapy resolve CTCAE less equal grade 1 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC great equal 3,000/microl , ANC great equal 1,500/mm ( 3 ) , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) , hemoglobin great equal 9 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( AST , ALT alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5 time ULN bilirubin less equal 1.5 time ULN ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine less equal 1.5 time ULN and/or creatinine clearance great equal 50 cc/min calculate CockcroftGault ) start therapy . Patients must also serum potassium great equal 3.5 mmol/L , magnesium , phosphate calcium level within normal level ; supplementation allow . In case serum calcium normal range , 2 option would available : 1 ) calcium adjust albumin obtain substitute measure serum value . Exclusion base adjust albumin value fall normal limit . 2 ) Determine ionize calcium level . Exclusion base whether ionized calcium level normal range despite supplementation . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must either receive steroid , stable dose steroid least five day prior registration . The effect AZD7451 develop human fetus unknown .

Congenital long QT syndrome 1st degree relative unexplained sudden death 40 year age . QTc Bazett correction unmeasurable , &gt; 470 msec screen ECG . ( Note : If subject QTc interval &gt; 470 msec screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must less equal 470 msec order subject eligible study . Patients receive drug risk QTc prolongation exclude QTc great equal 460 msec . Any concurrent medication may cause QTc prolongation induce Torsades de Pointes 1 ) Drugs list Appendix H , Table 2 , investigator opinion discontinue allow ; however , must monitor closely .
