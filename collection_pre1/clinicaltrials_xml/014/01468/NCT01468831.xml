	<detailed_description>Objective : Retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) significant source vision loss , affect mostly healthy people 55 year age . The common source vision loss macular edema accompany retinal injury . Very recently , study employ monthly anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) treatment demonstrate benefit line treatment ; however , duration effectiveness appear short live length time need monthly injection remain unknown . A histologic study human retina RVOs find presence activate microglia . Microglia capable migrate retina site inflammation associate closely neurons vasculature , key cellular player mediation process chronic inflammation . For reason , microglia represent promise cellular target form therapy limit deleterious inflammatory change find vein occlusion . Minocycline , second-generation tetracycline , show exhibit anti-inflammatory property , include microglia inhibition . The objective study investigate safety efficacy minocycline microglia inhibitor participant branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Study Population : A minimum ten maximum 20 participant meet eligibility criterion may enrol . Eligibility criterion include : foveal center-involved macular edema secondary BRVO , retinal thickness central subfield great 350 micron measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) visual acuity ( VA ) 20/32 20/200 study eye . Design : In pilot , double-masked , randomize , multi- center study , participant receive monthly bevacizumab injection first three month , follow PRN dose . In addition , participant take oral dose 100 mg minocycline placebo twice daily 24 month . During monthly visit , participant visual acuity measure undergo OCT test measure retinal thickness . At Month 3 visit thereafter , participant evaluate `` improvement '' `` worsen '' eligible additional bevacizumab treatment and/or investigational product ( IP ) depend criterion fulfill . Additionally , Month 12 , participant also evaluate improvement . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome difference mean change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , measure ETDRS letter , minocycline placebo group study eye 12 month compare baseline . Secondary outcome include difference minocycline placebo group number intravitreal bevacizumab injection 12 24 month baseline , change mean macular sensitivity measure microperimetry 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , mean change BCVA 24 month compare baseline , change retinal thickness measure OCT 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , number participant improve great equal 1 logOCT scale step 12 24 month compare baseline , well change fluid leakage macula demonstrate fluorescein angiography 12 24 month compare baseline . Safety outcomes include number participant withdrawal , number severity systemic ocular toxicity number adverse event .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present : Participant another investigational study actively receive investigational product BRVO . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . Participant known hypersensitivity sodium fluorescein dye . Participant condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Participant history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . Participant history chronic hepatitis liver failure . Participant allergy hypersensitivity minocycline drug tetracycline family . Participant currently take tetracycline medication . Participant take medication could adversely interact minocycline methoxyflurane . Participant blood pressure great 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , participant become eligible . Participant currently treat systemic antiVEGF agent systemic steroid . Participant cerebral vascular event ( CVA ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) within three month prior study entry . Participant history thyroid cancer . Study Eye Eligibility Criteria : The participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list : Study Eye The study eye bestcorrected ETDRS visual acuity score 78 34 letter ( i.e. , 20/32 20/200 ) . The study eye show evidence definite retinal thickening due BRVO base clinical examination involve center macula refractory therapy base investigator clinical judgment . BRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence RVO ( e.g. , telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate ( previously dilate ) venous system one two quadrant less retina drain affected vein . Hemiretinal vein occlusion ( HRVO ) RVO involve two altitudinal quadrant . In study , eye HRVO consider BRVO give treatment BRVO eye . The study eye retinal thickness central subfield baseline OCT measurement &gt; 350 micron , measure Zeiss Cirrus spectral domain OCT , equivalent retinal thickness similar OCT machine . The study eye medium clarity pupillary dilation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . Furthermore , participant must able cooperate procedure accurate fundus photograph . Study Eye The study eye macular edema consider due cause BRVO . An eye consider eligible : The macular edema consider related cataract extraction , Clinical examination and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface disease ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema , Clinical examination , medical history and/or fluorescein angiography suggest diabetic retinopathy primary cause edema . The study eye history recurrent RVO . The study eye history RVO present &gt; 18 month . A brisk afferent pupillary defect ( APD ) present study eye . An ocular condition present study eye , opinion investigator , visual acuity would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigmentary change , dense subfoveal hard exudate , laser scar fovea , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition ( RVO ) present , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc. ) . A substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity three line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) present study eye . The study eye panretinal sectoral scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within four month prior study entry . The study eye par plana vitrectomy within six month prior study entry . The study eye undergone major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within three month prior study entry .
