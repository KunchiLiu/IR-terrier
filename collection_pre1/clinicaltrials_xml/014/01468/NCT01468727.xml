	<brief_summary>Mutans streptococci ( MS ) lactobacillus specie ( LB ) two group infectious cariogenic ( caries-causing ) bacteria strongly associate dental caries ( dental decay ) . Infants acquire cariogenic bacteria mother early development via saliva . There several study demonstrate significant reduction dental caries associate consumption food additive know xylitol child adult . Xylitol non-toxic 5 carbon polyol , approve food additive FDA , taste like behaves like sucrose human . Xylitol use sugar substitute reduce dental caries fermentable caries cause bacteria . In addition , observe positive beneficial side effect sugar substitute xylitol show reduce mother child bacterial transfer use mother . It commonly recommend wipe infant ' teeth gum soft cloth reduce formation dental bacterial plaque . Recently wipe market contain xylitol provide safe sweet sensation infant cleaning procedure . However , study conduct ass biological effect apply xylitol directly teeth gums infant . This study conduct test whether xylitol apply swab directly infant 's teeth gum effectively reduce bacterial transfer mother child . Children age two year old whose mother high cariogenic bacterial count recruit use xylitol wipe 3-4 time daily addition normal preventive regimen . This randomized double blind study control group receive placebo wipe ( xylitol ) experimental group receive xylitol wipe . The mother-child pair MS LB bacterial count caries score child measure baseline , 3 month , 6 month 1 year . We contact patient recruit study inquire whether willing return follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 year post-wipe treatment completion . If successful , study support use simple caries preventive measure could easily safely implement young child . Ten MS isolate unique LB colony isolate saliva sample study genetic diversity virulence factor . The investigator also investigate whether specific MS gene relate ECC prevention effect daily xylitol-wipe application use genomic sequence MS isolate current study active intervention apply .</brief_summary>
