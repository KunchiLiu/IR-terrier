	<brief_summary>The study serve identification early form pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) connective tissue disease hemodynamic follow-up investigated patient . The basic hypothesis PAH may start remodel small pulmonary artery , lead stiffen vessel , indicate inability vasodilatation thus disproportional increase pulmonary pressure exercise . Recent study show proportion patient may develop manifest PAH within year . The early identification patient understanding natural course disease may improve prognosis . The aim present study investigate hemodynamic clinical change patient connective tissue disease time interval 3-5 year focus development pulmonary hypertension .</brief_summary>
