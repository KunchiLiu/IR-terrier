	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence remain serious public health problem ; however clearly effective pharmacological treatment identify date . The investigator hypothesize identification subgroup cocaine-dependent patient help develop targeted effective treatment . The investigator observe 30-40 % cocaine-dependent patient enter medication trial achieve abstinence lead-in period ( two week prior start medication ) . Initial abstinence strongly predictive abstinence subsequent medication trial . The investigator also observe low dopamine release striatum associate great choice cocaine volunteer failure cocaine-dependent patient respond behavioral treatment . The investigator hypothesize individual difficulty achieve abstinence deficit dopaminergic function correct deficit use dopaminergic medication LCE ( levodopa combination carbidopa entacapone ) result clinical improvement . The propose study consist three consecutive phase : 1 ) 2-week outpatient lead-in phase behavioral therapy administer ; 2 ) 15-21 day inpatient phase ( participant start study medication undergo brain imaging ; one PET two fMRI scan session ) ; 3 ) 24 week outpatient treatment trial . Study medication ( LCE placebo ) administer double-blind , placebo control manner one week inpatient phase follow 12 week outpatient trial . During remain 12 week outpatient trial participant receive therapy . The purpose lead-in phase identify patient achieve abstinence response behavioral treatment . Subsequently , two match subgroup participant ( half achieve abstinence half achieve abstinence ) undergo [ 11C ] raclopride displacement PET brain imaging procedure . This procedure allow measurement dopamine release response single dose methylphenidate , investigator determine failure achieve abstinence lead-in period associate low dopamine transmission . All participant propose study also undergo functional MRI Motivational Incentive Delay task ( fMRI/MID ) . This task think reflect dopaminergic transmission brain-reward system safer feasible PET . The investigator hypothesize fMRI/MID correlate strongly result PET procedure , thereby suggest also reflect status striatal dopamine functioning . In addition , group healthy control undergo one fMRI scan order validate procedure ass deficit detect cocaine-dependent participant . Cocaine-dependent participant undergo two fMRI/MID , one baseline another week treatment LCE ass treatment LCE may reverse baseline deficit change associate clinical improvement .</detailed_description>
