	<brief_title>Cetuximab Recombinant Interleukin-12 Treating Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck That Recurrent , Metastatic , Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find safe tolerable interleukin ( IL ) -12 ( recombinant interleukin-12 ) dose use combination cetuximab patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck . ( Phase I ) II . To determine response rate combination IL-12 cetuximab . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize immunologic effect IL-12 administer combination cetuximab . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study recombinant IL-12 follow phase II study . Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 5 begin course 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve clinical response stable disease may continue therapy disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
