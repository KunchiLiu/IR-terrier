	<brief_summary>The objective Phase II study assess diagnostic accuracy sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) identification patient breast cancer use near-infrared ( NIR ) fluorescence optical imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-Time Near-infrared ( NIR ) Mapping Sentinel Lymph Nodes Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty participant consent Brigham Women 's Hospital ( currently enrol ) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( currently non-enrolling ) , undergo standard care breast cancer SLN map Tc-99m enrol study . Prior surgery , patient undergo lymphoscintigraphy standard care . At time SLN mapping , patient inject indocyanine green dye ( ICG ) . Concurrently , custom-designed imaging platform utilizes NIR fluorescence optic employ identify dye path lymphatic track , eventual highlighting SLN . Both color image NIR image merge give operating surgeon clear picture ICG track superimpose anatomical landmark . This technique identify SLN provide accurate video image location . The surgeon resect SLNs identify Tc-99m NIR fluorescence , confirm radioactivity NIR fluorescence signal resection .</detailed_description>
