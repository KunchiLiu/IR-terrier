	<brief_summary>Background : - In eye disease central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) , fluid collect retina back eye . CSC resolve , people last several month come back . The fluid buildup CSC cause vision loss . The drug interferon gamma-1b help reduce fluid accumulation retina . Researchers want see interferon gamma-1b help treat prevent vision loss CSC . Objectives : - To see interferon gamma-1b eye drop safe effective treatment CSC . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age CSC least one eye . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also eye exam blood test . - This study require least ten visit National Institutes Health eye clinic total 52 week ( one year ) . Most visit last 4 hour . - Participants return eye clinic 2 day first visit 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 week start study eye drop . These visit involve blood test eye exam . - Participants receive study eye drop initial visit . The drop must use three four time day 2 week . They must store cool place ( like refrigerator ) . The dos follow escalation schedule first participant receive 2 drop three time day last participant receive 4 drop four time day . To maximize safety , most-recently enrolled participant complete Week 4 next participant enroll ( e.g. , second enrol participant enrol first complete Week 4 visit ) . - If CSC improve first 2 week , participant receive another 2 week eye drop . This set drop start 4 week initial study visit . - If CSC improve 8-week study period , participant may receive additional eye drop maximum dose 4 drop four time daily . - The study end participant one year ( 48 week initial study visit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) retinal disorder characterize accumulation serous fluid retina think due excessive choroidal hyperpermeability . The retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) play critical role remove fluid subretinal space . This RPE `` pump '' believe key player reabsorption subretinal fluid maintenance retinal attachment . Fluid transport assay examine whether interferon gamma induces change fluid transport across human fetal RPE monolayers show increase fluid absorption retinal choroidal side tissue . An vivo rodent model retinal detachment use measure effect interferon gamma re-absorption follow retinal detachment show addition interferon gamma anterior eye surface cause significant , rapid decrease retinal detachment volume first hour observation . This pilot study investigate safety , tolerability potential efficacy serial ocular instillation topical interferon gamma-1b classic CSC . Study Population : Five participant subretinal fluid due classic CSC initially enrol . However , additional two participant may enrol order obtain five participant include analysis participant withdraw study . Design : In Phase I/II , non-randomized , prospective , uncontrolled , dose-escalation , single-center pilot study , series ocular instillation topical interferon gamma-1b administer study eye two-week period . If fluid re-accumulates increase , participant eligible re-challenging topical interferon gamma-1b study eye Week 4 . Participants follow one year . Participants may eligible additional re-challenges initial eight week study period end fluid re-accumulates increase . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure relate safety tolerability serial ocular instillation topical interferon gamma-1b assess number severity adverse event ( AEs ) relate investigational product number withdrawal . Secondary efficacy outcome include change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , central retinal thickness maximum lesion volume measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , leakage observe fluorescein angiogram ( FA ) , autofluorescence pattern observe fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) image mean macular sensitivity assess microperimetry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant must 18 year age old . Participant must understand sign protocol inform consent document . Female participant childbearing potential ( see Appendix 1 definition ) must pregnant breastfeeding , must negative pregnancy test screening must willing undergo pregnancy test schedule study visit . Female participant must postmenopausal ( see Appendix 1 ) , must hysterectomy , partner vasectomy , completely abstinent intercourse must agree practice two reliable method contraception throughout course study six week administration investigational product . Acceptable method contraception include : hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) ; intrauterine device ; barrier method ( diaphragm , condom ) spermicide ; surgical sterilization ( tubal ligation ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant actively receive investigational medication another research trial may unknown effect CSC determine investigator . Participant evidence ocular disease CSC study eye may confound outcome study ( e.g. , neovascular agerelated macular degeneration ) . Participant evidence choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) study eye . Participant expect need ocular surgery study eye eight week study . Participant expect need focal laser treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) study eye eight week study . Participant medication enhance RPE pump fluid ( e.g. , acetazolamide ) . Participant steroid medication ( oral ( e.g. , prednisone ) , topical ( e.g. , hydrocortisone cream ) inhale ( e.g. , fluticasone inhaler ) ) . Participant systemic condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , Hypertension control medication active infection require treatment ) . Participant allergic fluorescein dye . Participant multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , interferon gamma may cause MS exacerbation . Participant anticortisol antiandrogen medication ( e.g. , finasteride mifepristone ) , data suggest medication may reduce CSC fluid .</criteria>
