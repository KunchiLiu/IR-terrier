	<brief_summary>The patient number metabolic syndrome diabetes double last decade . Data physical exercise ameliorate metabolic syndrome convincing , although mechanisms effect man clear . Numerous endocrine molecular mechanism modify physical exercise know hypoxia-sensitive , i.e . hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) regulation . Thus , relative hypoxia may link physical exercise modification endogenous metabolism . Medical community seem ill equip address primary issue involve . The investigator experience normobaric `` hypoxia chamber '' test ( physical exercise ) training program , use state-of-the-art assessment available nowhere else Germany . The investigator compare hypoxia chamber , ambient training , test notion specific exercise condition could regulate specific molecular pathway involve pathogenesis metabolic syndrome . Indeed , hypoxia chamber training could superior conventional training term reduce cardiovascular risk factor improve fitness . The investigator test overall metabolism-related effect metabolic chamber . The investigator test local metabolism microdialysis exercise routine , investigator perform fat muscle biopsy investigate tissue-related effect . The investigator include experience broad-ranging spectrum . The investigator finding might improve understand mechanism link physical exercise endogenous metabolism . Furthermore , could influence decision-making regard non-pharmacological intervention .</brief_summary>
