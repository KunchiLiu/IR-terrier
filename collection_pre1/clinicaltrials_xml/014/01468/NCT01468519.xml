	<detailed_description>Background Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) common form organic sexual dysfunction male diabetes , estimate incidence rate 35 75 % . Fifty percent men diabetes afflicted ED within 10 year diagnosis . Long-term poor glycemic control increase risk ED . Neuropathy major contributor diabetic ED . Other cause ED diabetes include vascular disease , metabolic control , nutrition , endocrine disorder , psychogenic factor , drug . Continuous Sub-cutaneous Insulin Infusion The Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII ) Pump ( insulin pump short ) pager-sized device connect body infusion set deliver insulin continuously . It consist disposable reservoir insulin , disposable infusion set , include cannula subcutaneous insertion tube system connects insulin reservoir cannula . Insulin pump therapy new therapy diabetes mellitus . It alternative delivery mechanism administration insulin find superior ordinary syrinx insulin pen . Insulin pump popularly use T1DM nowadays insulin pump commonly use T2DM patient well . A guideline use insulin pump India recently publish Diabetes Technology Therapeutics journal , include participation Jothydev 's Diabetes Center . Although comparatively costly , advantage CSII mode insulin delivery include good glycemic control , few hypoglycemic episode , improve quality life . Our center report significant reduction HbA1c subject multiple daily insulin switch CSII . Relevant Clinical Data In aforementioned study CSII Type 2 diabetes patient study , 83 % men report improvement sexual function query 6 month CSII . The mode improvement magnitude effect know , need ascertain prospective trial . The present study proposal corroborate finding , obtain clarification effect size . Potential Benefits &amp; Risks The following improvement expect follow initiation insulin pump therapy . - Improvement HbA1c - Reduction blood sugar fluctuation - Reduction major minor hypoglycemic episodes - Reduction total daily dose insulin - Improvement QOL The following risks/disadvantages use insulin pump therapy - Cost pump consumables high mode insulin delivery - There risk infection cannula change every three day . - Improper use insulin pump boluses lead insulin stack low sugar . Proper patient education monitor part study overcome risk insulin pump therapy .</detailed_description>
