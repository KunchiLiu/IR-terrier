	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose pasireotide see well work give together docetaxel prednisone treat patient metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pasireotide may inhibit secretion hormone . Giving pasireotide together docetaxel prednisone may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) level SOM 230 ( pasireotide ) combination docetaxel prednisone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability combination metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . II . To evaluate preliminary efficacy combination SOM 230 docetaxel prednisone define response rate ( measurable prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] ) , time progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) combination . IV . To assess pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect combination see baseline level change insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 , serum chromogranin A ( SCA ) , neuron specific enolase ( NSE ) , associate TTP OS . V. To assess pretherapy circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) count change CTC therapy , associate TTP OS . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study pasireotide follow phase II study . Patients receive pasireotide intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 , docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour , prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) continuously . Courses docetaxel repeat every 21 day course pasireotide repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
