	<brief_title>Comparison Biliary Stenting Alone vs. Stenting With Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) During ERCP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful palliation biliary obstruction main goal reduce morbidity mortality patient biliary disease biliary obstruction relate cholangiocarcinoma . Surgical biliary bypass unfortunately complicate 30-day postoperative mortality rate 7 24 % . Moreover , recovery time quality life follow surgery improved minority . At present endoscopic insertion plastic metal stent method choice relieve obstructive jaundice without high morbidity mortality associate surgery . But relief unfortunately temporary since stent tend become obstructed fact effective biliary drainage proximal lesion challenge . Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) new therapeutic approach specifically target neoplastic cell . This therapy involve intravenous administration photosensitize agent follow activation agent illumination non-thermal light specific wavelength , result cell death direct cytotoxicity ischemic necrosis . Cytotoxicity directly proportional tissue oxygenation . A prospective , randomize control trial study Ortner et confirm significant advantage PDT regard relief jaundice , quality life , survival . The improvement survival randomize PDT group impressive believe unethical continue randomization first 39 patient ( 20 19 group ) .Previously , principal investigator conduct study ( also conduct Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography PDT ) University Virginia , would continue conduct procedure , well study WCMC .</detailed_description>
