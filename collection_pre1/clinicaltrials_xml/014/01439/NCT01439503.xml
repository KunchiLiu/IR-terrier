	<detailed_description>The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) term AIDS `` health crisis '' African Americans call heighten national response . The crisis especially dramatic South apparent young African American men sex men ( MSM ) exceedingly likely infect . Unfortunately , ever-expanding HIV epidemic experience population match equal attention development efficacious prevention program . The propose project expand upon NIMH-funded study ( R21 MH066682-01A1 ) conduct Dr. Crosby . His study young African American male find brief , clinic-based intervention reduce incidence subsequent STDs 50 % . This brief , one-on-one , intervention program , know Focus Future ( FOF ) , practical alternative group-based safer sex program difficult translate science practice . The program classify `` Best Practice '' intervention CDC . This project begin extensive formative phase design adapt FOF MSM . The adapted program seek `` sexualize '' condom promote consistent correct use well prevent STD/HIV . The program uniquely flexible apply MSM regardless HIV serostatus . The adapted program test two-arm efficacy trail . We recruit 620 MSM ( 15-29 year age ) publicly-funded STD clinic Jackson MS. Men treatment condition compare men receive control condition comprise standard care counsel clinic plus free ditty bag supply `` condom lube buffet '' ( condom/lube distribution ) . The trial test four hypothesis : 1 ) Men randomize receive intervention low incidence rate laboratory-confirmed STDs ( urine assay rectal swab ) 6-month 12-month follow-up assessment ) compare control . 2 ) Men randomize receive intervention report significantly few act unprotected penetrative sex ( penile-vaginal penile-anal ) follow-up assessment compare control . 3 ) Men randomize receive intervention report significantly few unprotected penetrative ( penile-vaginal penile-anal ) sex partner follow-up assessment compare control . 4 ) Men randomize receive intervention report significantly fewer negative experience condom use follow-up assessment compare control . Given dearth evidence-based option intervene vulnerable population clinical setting , demonstrate efficacy adapt program important implication U.S. public health effort direct towards prevention STD/HIV .</detailed_description>
