	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine change specific gene product placenta cord/infant blood affect baby 's birth weight , increase risk premature birth , increase risk develop disease prematurity . We would also like characterize whether placental epigenetic change placental marker environmental exposure associate premature birth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prematurity , diseases prematurity growth-disorders newborn infant contribute significantly morbidity mortality see newborn infant [ 1,2,3 ] . One eight newborn infant USA born premature ( gestational age le 37 completed week ) . In 2004 , 27,860 infant die within first year life , great 16,000 born premature [ 2 ] . Moreover , premature infant survive neonatal period increase risk cerebral palsy , developmental delay , growth impairment long-term respiratory disability [ 3-5 ] . Additionally , fetal growth restriction fetal growth excess result infant deliver small gestational age infant large gestational age infant , respectively . Infants born growth-disorders increase risk perinatal morbidity mortality adult significant risk obesity , type II diabetes heart disease [ 6,7 ] . While etiology preterm birth growth-disorders ascribe maternal condition , chromosomal defect specific maternal environmental exposure newborn infant , majority etiology remain unknown [ 8,9 ] . There increase evidence point role genetic susceptibility factor causation prematurity growth-disorders newborn infant [ 8 , 10-12 ] . Further , epigenetic change growth regulate inflammatory gene placenta program fetus premature birth , growth-disorders disease postnatal period . The overall objective application four-fold . 1 . To determine whether altered placental fetal expression imprint gene associate disorder growth , prematurity postnatal diseases newborn infant . 2 . To determine whether altered placental expression gene regulate innate immune response associate premature birth postnatal disease newborn infant . 3 . To determine whether placental marker environmental exposure ( Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAH ) epigenetic change placental inflammatory gene growth gene associate prematurity postnatal diseases newborn infant . 4 . To determine whether cord blood immune responses marker immune-cell function different preterm term infant associate postnatal disease preterm infant .</detailed_description>
