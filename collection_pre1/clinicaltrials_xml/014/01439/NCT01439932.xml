	<brief_summary>Background : Plantar fasciitis ( PF ) common problem tend attack 10 % population life . This degenerative condition plantar fascia insertion bottom heel . Pain appear mainly first step morning prolong lack weight bearing . The pain intensity high cause functional limitation reduce quality life . Despite high prevalence PF , treatment controversial support extensive research . Review previous study various treatment , mention steroid injection , shock wave , night splint , orthotics , heel pad stretch exercise . Limitation ankle dorsi flexion common find thought contribute factor development pathology . So far , issue address mainly soft tissue therapy technique improve ankle range motion patient PF . Only one study ( Joshua et al 2009 ) evaluate effect ankle joint mobilization PF . However , study mobilization part complex therapy therefore effect treatment attribute solely . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness ankle mid-foot joint mobilization pain function patient PF . The hypothesis manual mobilization ankle midfoot joint addition conventional physical therapy improve pain function significantly conventional treatment , patient PF . Methods : 50 patient , age 18-75 diagnosis PF meet inclusion criterion recruit randomly divide two group . Both group receive commonly accept physical therapy treatment include stretch exercise plantar fascia triceps surae muscle ultrasound therapy site symptom . The study group receive addition manual mobilization ankle midfoot joint . The procedure take place physiotherapy clinic Bat-Yamon General Health Services last four week , twice week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective randomize double-blinded controlled clinical trial . Setting : Bat-Yamon physical therapy clinic Clalit health service Bat Yam . Ethical consideration : The research proposal submit approval Helsinki Committee Meir Hospital Kefar Saba . All patient sign inform consent form accord law medical ethic . Subjects recruited population patient refer physical therapy treatment PF diagnosis plantar fasciitis calcaneal spur . Randomization carry use envelope prepare advance . Each patient receive end baseline examination envelope type treatment deliver therapist examiner patient blind treatment group . Baseline final evaluation perform examiner-therapist treatment perform three physical therapist Bat-Yamon clinic experience least 3 year receive proper instruction training . Baseline examination perform complete informed consent form include demographic information fill patient , clinical interview examination examiner . Demographic information include age , gender , weight , BMI ( calculated examiner ) , history problem , habit related physical activity occupation general health . The interview refer etiology nature symptom . The clinical examination include observation foot structure gait pattern , presence hit swell . Palpation pain location ruling fat pad Syndrome , clunk test neurodynamic tibial nerve perform rule tarsal tunnel syndrome ( TTS ) . Patients suspicion one diagnose recruit . Dorsi flexion range motion leg measure compare range end treatment . Measurement take two way , weight bear inclinometer - patient stand lounge position test leg front ask bend knee leg possible without lift heel floor . The angle measure angle tibia vertical line floor.Second time without weight bear Goniometer- patient lie back pillow test knee , therapist performs maximum dorsi flexion passively ask patient add active movement direction . The angle measure fibula fifth metatarsus</detailed_description>
