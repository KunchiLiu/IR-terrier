	<brief_summary>The relative risk psoriasis severity directly relate body mass index ( BMI ) .Patients psoriasis likely undergo vicious circle obesity skin disease reinforce . To investigate patient ' opinion body weight ( BW ) , possibility dietary approach psoriasis , examine adherence effect hypo-energetic diet maintain disease remission obese patient dedicate questionnaire administer 200 consecutive patient ( 125 men 75 woman ) moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis investigate whether diet factor could influence psoriasis severity course . In second part study , obese patient psoriasis remission ( PASI improvement ≥ 75 % ) least 12 week methotrexate therapy randomly assign receive hypo-caloric diet free diet 24 week , follow additional 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weight Reduction Alone May Not Sufficient Maintain Disease Remission Obese Patients With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic plaque psoriasis inflammatory skin disease associate obesity 13-34 % case . In recent year , prevalence overweight obesity increase almost develop countries.Obesity high body mass index show risk factor development psoriasis large , prospective study obesity precede development psoriasis . More recently , obesity adulthood show risk factor also psoriatic arthritis . On hand , one psoriasis establish may favor behavior facilitate overweight obesity . To investigate patient ' opinion BW , possibility dietary approach psoriasis , specific questionnaire administer 200 consecutive patient moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis . In second part study , 24-week randomized , control , investigator-blinded clinical trial perform limited number patient see whether hypo-caloric diet maintain disease remission obese patient previously treat methotrexate . Patients recruit consecutively admit psoriasis outpatient clinic University Hospital Verona . The inclusion criterion : patient ≥ 18 year age moderate severe psoriasis BMI ≥ 30 without psoriasis arthritis , treat methotrexate obtain reduction psoriasis severity least 75 % ( PASI 75 ) 12 week enrol study . Exclusion criterion type psoriasis ( guttate , erythrodermic pustular psoriasis ) severe obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 ) . All patient give write informed consent study-related procedure perform . All subject visit two dermatologist record demographic , biometrical , relevant patient 's data . Visits schedule screening , baseline , every 4 week 24 . Collected data include age , sex , weight , height , BMI , psoriasis duration concomitant medication . The dermatologist perform PASI score unaware randomization assignment . Patients stop methotrexate therapy randomly assign either two group : first group receive low-calorie diet administer dietitian ( intervention group ) whereas second group receive dietetic recommendation ( control group ) . Randomization perform use computer-generated random number block size 4 subject . Patients underwent clinical nutritional follow-up every month . The low-calorie diet design achieve loss 5-10 % initial body weight . The caloric restriction 500 kcal rest energy expenditure , evaluate Harris-Benedict equation . Intervention group patient receive balanced diet scheme , base caloric intake reduction relate BMI sex ( range : 1200-1500 kcal/d woman , 1300-1600 kcal/d men ) . Relapses consider loss 50 % PASI improvement score baseline pre-methotrexate value .</detailed_description>
