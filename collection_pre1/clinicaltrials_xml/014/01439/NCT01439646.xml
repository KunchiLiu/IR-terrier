	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Clinical Outcome High Risk Patients Who Received Empirical Antifungal Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Primary Objective : - To study effect Empirical Antifungal therapy clinical outcome high risk patient suspect Invasive Fungal Infection admit ICU/Critical care unit - Secondary Objectives : 1 . To know current epidemiology IFI management approach patient high risk Invasive fungal infection 2 . Identify risk factor associate Invasive fungal infection 3 . To comment appropriateness empirical therapy use base proven/probable diagnosis Inclusion criterion : All Non-neutropenic patient admit intensive care/critical care unit prescribed form pre-emptive / empirical Antifungal therapy specify study duration period Exclusion criterion : Neutropenic patient Patients proven invasive fungal infection antifungal therapy initiate confirmation Invasive fungal infection/Candidemia Patients receive prophylactic antifungal agent Study Design - Multi Center ( Dual-center - Fortis Hospital Apollo Hospital ) Retrospective , Observational Study - Study Patients : 100 number Retrospective data collect patient admit intensive care unit/Critical care unit ( study investigator ) receive form Empirical / Preemptive ( prophylactic ) Antifungal therapy ( duration , irrespective culture positivity ) suspect case Invasive Fungal Infection . Following detail patient capture Demographics , primary secondary diagnosis , co-morbidities , grade infection , severity sepsis disease . Daily hemodynamic parameter , routine blood test include Total count hematologic profile , renal profile , Liver function test , electrolyte status , additional test whatever do course therapy . Fungal C/S report sample culture report Duration treatment , Changes therapy , Adjuvant therapy - relevant case , Any Surgical procedure undertaken : e.g. , surgical debridement , fasciotomy dressing ( part standard treatment accord available guideline ) - relevant case , Any additional invasive procedure ( eg : Mechanical ventilation ) , Reported adverse event Recording Risk factor invasive fungal infection detail limited : 1 . Diabetes , 2 . Use immunosuppressant ( Eg . steroid ) 3 . Chronic Hemodialysis , TPN , Mechanical ventilation , 4 . Sepsis/Septic shock , Multiorgan dysfunction ( one organ ) , 5 . Non response &gt; 4 day broad spectrum antibiotic , 6 . Structural lung disease , 7 . Major abdominal surgery , 8 . Multifocal colonization - Study Duration : A period one year starting backwards December 2010 till January 2010 . ( max . 100 patient retrospectively track back Dec 2010 whichever come first ) . Statistical analysis Appropriate statistical tool `` Multiple logistic regression '' model use analyze linkage different parameter record study Primary Endpoint : 1 . Mortality Short term ( antifungal therapy ) Long term ( within 12 week completion antifungal therapy ) 2 . Mean Duration ICU ( Intensive Care Unit ) / HDU ( High Dependency Unit stay initiation Antifungal Therapy Secondary Endpoints : The common pathogen associate Invasive Fungal Infections The common empirical antifungal agent use suspected Invasive Fungal Infection The mean time initiation Antifungal therapy suspicion invasive fungal infection . The mean duration antifungal therapy The risk factor patient proven/probable invasive fungal infection The appropriateness antifungal agent base microbiological and/or clinical outcome</detailed_description>
