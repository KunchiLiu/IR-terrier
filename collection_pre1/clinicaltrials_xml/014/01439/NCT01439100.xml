	<brief_title>A Randomised Placebo Controlled Study OXN PR Severe Parkinson 's Disease Associated Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management PD recognise unmet need . Estimates incidence vary literature 29 % 83 % . The type source pain experienced PD patient vary include : musculoskeletal pain , PD relate chronic pain , fluctuation-related pain , nocturnal pain , coat-hanger pain , oro-facial pain peripheral limb abdominal pain ( also include drug-induced pain ) . Whilst modification dose dopaminergic therapy represent common method control pain symptom , must balance worsen side effect increase dos treatment type . Oxycodone hydrochloride naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate combine oral prolonged release tablet ( OXN PR ) , investigational product use study . OXN PR prolong release tablet consist oxycodone naloxone 2:1 ratio . Due local competitive antagonism opioid receptor-mediated oxycodone effect naloxone gut , naloxone reduces opioid-associated bowel dysfunction . The purpose study investigate whether effective pain control treatment PD associate pain may achieve OXN PR . The secondary consideration study examine whether OXN PR may offer additional benefit patient Quality Life symptom PD . If effective pain relief achieve analgesic without side effect describe , could reduce need increase dose dopaminergic medication manage pain , therefore reduce negative side effect dopaminergic therapy described . Given prevalence constipation patient population bowel spar effect OXN PR combination treatment may provide ethical rationale use opioids .</detailed_description>
