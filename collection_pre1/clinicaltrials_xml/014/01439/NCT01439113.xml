	<brief_summary>The placement peripheral intravenous line ( IVs ) central treatment patient emergency department ( ED ) . The procedure use phlebotomy administration variety therapeutic medication intravenous fluid . This procedure standard care , IVs routinely place experienced emergency nurse . Occasionally , nurse difficulty place IV line . The common reason underlie medical condition , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease , obesity , history intravenous drug use . When nurse unable place IV , option : 1 . Ask another nurse attempt line placement 2 . Ask physician establish access , usually involve placement central venous catheter , time-consuming procedure high risk infection peripheral line . The use bedside ultrasound become commonplace modern ED , Tufts Medical Center ED possess machine , use variety indication include diagnosis pregnancy , gall bladder disease , abdominal free fluid pericardial effusion . Another key use bedside ultrasound location blood vessel . In fact , expect place central venous catheter clinician use ultrasound guidance , ultrasound clearly demonstrate blood vessel . The procedure completely pain-free harmless , cost nothing perform . Recently , grow body evidence demonstrate placement peripheral IVs facilitate use ultrasound . Just useful central venous catheter , ultrasound also clearly show small peripheral vein . Multiple study demonstrate physician place IVs ultrasound guidance . However , nurse de facto expert place peripheral IVs usual procedure perform perform procedure multiple time day . In study , provide two-hour training program cohort nurse . The training program instruct use single-operator ultrasound-guided IV placement . After training , nurse encounter patient difficult IV access ( either 2 fail attempt history difficult access ) , patient consent randomize either standard care ( whatever nurse elect ) use bedside ultrasound . In meantime , research assistant measure time IV placement start enrollment , number skin puncture necessary place IV , ask patient question satisfaction IV placement pain experience . Our hypothesis single-operator , ED nurse use bedside ultrasound facilitate IV placement patient difficult IV access , save time also improve patient satisfaction comfort .</brief_summary>
