	<brief_summary>BAY94-9343 antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) direct cancer antigen mesothelin tumor cell . This study attempt answer follow question : - What side effect BAY94-9343 give different dose level schedule ? - What dose level schedule BAY94-9343 test future clinical research study ? - How much BAY94-9343 blood specific time administration ? - Does treatment BAY94-9343 show effect tumor growth ? - Are specific biomarkers might able explain patient respond treatment others ?</brief_summary>
