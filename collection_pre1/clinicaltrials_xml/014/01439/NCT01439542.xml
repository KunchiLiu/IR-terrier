	<brief_title>FASTR : Fairly Brief Androgen Suppression Stereotactic Radiotherapy High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial establish improved efficacy ( well biochemical control disease free survival ) combine radical radiation ( 70-80Gy/7-8 week ) combine long term hormone therapy ( 2-3 year adjuvant luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ) compare primary hormone therapy radiotherapy alone men locally advanced/high risk disease . While approach may tolerable fit individual , combination may well tolerate frail individual live distance may find difficult attend 7 week radiation due travel consideration . Those individual co-morbidities diabetes , coronary artery disease osteoporosis may condition exacerbate long term hormone therapy . This pilot study explore combination stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) approach ( design iso-effective late effect standard radiotherapy ) combine one year LHRH agonist old men high risk disease less fit ( Vulnerable Elderly Score &gt; 3 ) men unwilling undertake conventionally fractionate therapy three year adjuvant hormone therapy .</detailed_description>
