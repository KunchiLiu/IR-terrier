	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe safety immunogenicity repeat administration Adacel vaccine approximately 10 year follow initial administration vaccine . Antibody level prior revaccination also use characterize antibody persistence follow initial vaccination 10 year earlier . Primary Objectives : - To compare seroprotection rate tetanus diphtheria induced Adacel vaccine induce Td Adsorbed vaccine . - To compare booster response rate tetanus diphtheria induced Adacel vaccine induce Td Adsorbed vaccine . - To compare anti-pertussis geometric mean antibody concentration ( GMCs ) induce Adacel vaccine GMCs induce Daptacel® vaccine give infant . Secondary Objectives : - To describe rate immediate reaction , solicit reaction , unsolicited adverse event ( AEs ) , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) follow vaccination Adacel Td Adsorbed vaccine . - To describe booster response rate pertussis antigens follow revaccination Adacel vaccine .</brief_summary>
