	<brief_title>Radio Frequency Ablation Management Pancreatico-biliary Disorders : A Multicenter Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bile duct cancer pancreatic cancer cancer surgically remove . As cancer grows , block drainage bile duct carry digestive juice gall bladder pancreas small intestine . ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ) often prescribe tube tiny camera attach inserted subject 's mouth advance place small intestine bile duct empty . Through scope doctor enlarge duct tiny balloon place plastic metal stent ( straw ) help keep bile duct open drain properly . However , due cancer , stent block eventually . The purpose registry record information evaluate impact radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) endoscopic radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) probe improve management bile duct cancer pancreatic cancer ablate tissue bile duct ( ) stent ( ) implant . By use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy heat tissue duct ( ) prior stent ( ) insertion , surround tissue becomes coagulate may delay tumor growth time stent lumen become block . Thereby , allow increase period need intervention stent implantation ( ) . The registry evaluate efficacy safety RFA procedure conduct pancreatico-biliary disorder . The safety efficacy various radio frequency ablation probe assess series study . This multi-center registry initiate : 1 . To document immediate post procedure clinical performance radio frequency ablation 'real world ' patient population require stent implantation pancreaticobiliary disorder . 2 . To assess immediate 6 month post procedure adverse event rate patient . 3 . To assess impact RFA life expectancy patient suffer pancreaticobiliary malignancy .</detailed_description>
