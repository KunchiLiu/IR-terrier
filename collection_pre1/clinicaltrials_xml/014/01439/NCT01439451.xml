	<detailed_description>A total 48 old adult enrol , evaluate train . They randomly assign two group : one exercise group ( perturbation training ) one group without perturbation . No gender base difference expect recovery outcome measure able pool male female individual analysis . Each subject experimental control group train 24 occasion period 10-12 week ( 20-30 minute , 2-3 times/week ) . This regimen base previous balance training study demonstrate improvement balance control similar training duration frequency . Gait balance function physical activity level test group , immediately , 3 6 month completion training period explore benefit carryover training . In addition use monthly phone call , fall , severity , functional activity limitation home community set health status monitor 12 month train period .</detailed_description>
