	<brief_summary>The purpose study test efficacy family nurture intervention neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Infants receive enhance mother-infant family nurture compare infant receive standard NICU care . The intervention enhance mother/infant interaction vital early development infant . The main goal get mother infant biological synchrony , emotional attunement mutual calm activity refer `` calming cycle '' . Mother 's encouraged engage calm cycle activity much possible . Her increased effectiveness calm infant hypothesize improve mother 's view baby , reduce negative emotion deliver baby prematurely , help gain confidence care-taking ability , study predict short length stay few re-hospitalizations . Another goal assist mother repeat calm cycle activity provide appropriate type stimulation baby important social , emotional , neurobehavioral development . Since preterm baby often easily upset , mother teach comfort calm baby . Assessments NICU follow-up visit two year test immediate long-term effect new approach nurture prematurely born infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The stress result preterm birth , requisite acute care prolong physical separation NICU adverse physiological/psychological effect infant mother . In particular , experience compromise establishment maintenance optimal mother-infant relationship . Within neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , parental involvement care necessarily supersede healthcare staff . Thus , necessary detrimental separation mother infant create critical period mother-infant bonding synchrony develop . The physiological challenge associate born soon , along disturbance normal mother-infant interaction key factor underlie risk premature infant broad range early midlife disorder . This study aim highlight importance investigate early intervention design overcome reduce effect environmental insult challenge implement randomize controlled trial Family Nurture Intervention NICU . The important source regulatory input contact mother nurture behavior . Mother-infant interaction foundation organization infant 's neurobiological , sensory , perceptual , emotional , physical , relational system . The infant 's response mother provide critical feedback shape behavior well . There many co-regulatory process embed synchronous reciprocal interaction cross neurophysiological neurobehavioral domain . The intervention design increase biologically important activity behavior enhance maternally-mediated sensory experience preterm infant , well infant-mediated sensory experience mother . The investigator hypothesize repeat engagement mother infant intervention 's calming activity increase effectiveness co-regulation immediate long-term beneficial effect . The study assess physiological behavioral outcome infant mother receive Family Nurture Intervention versus Standard Care course NICU stay .</detailed_description>
