	<brief_title>Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) Biliary Stricture Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct approximately 20 patient know suspected common bile duct common hepatic duct stricture schedule endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) duodenoscope-assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy ( DACP ) biopsy . Following initial fluoroscopic evaluation , study experimental procedure begin . The catheter pass auxiliary channel duodenoscope , across papilla common bile duct . The extra-biliary portion catheter visible duodenoscope time . The intrabiliary portion catheter visible fluoroscopy , position across biliary stricture . Rotational cross-sectional image bile duct obtain use OFDI image catheter pull back internal optical component pre-determined length . OFDI image conduct approximately 1 cm distal 1 cm proximal stricture margin identify fluoroscopy .</detailed_description>
