	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : This prospective single blind study aim compare influence two different catheter ablation strategy , long-term ablation outcome term AF recurrence quality life ( QoL ) patient present coexistent AF AFL . The two strategy evaluate 1 ) ablation paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) without flutter ( AFL ) ablation ( AF ± AFL ) versus 2 ) AFL ablation alone . Hypothesis : Ablation AF ± AFL result well long-term procedure outcome AFL-ablation alone patient document history AF AFL . Background : Coexistence AF AFL commonly encounter clinical practice . Patients arrhythmias experience symptom palpitation often describe sudden irregular flutter sensation chest , dyspnea , fatigue , dizziness fainting attack . These symptom make patient anxious tire seriously compromise QoL ( 1 ) . Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) emerge best therapeutic option drug-refractory AF case often use first-line therapy AFL ( 2 ) . Several study demonstrate significant improvement QoL follow catheter ablation ( CA ) patient either AF AFL ( 3-9 ) . However , little known impact CA QoL patient present coexistent AF AFL . No standard treatment guideline exist coexistent AF AFL . Determining best ablative approach type patient remain challenge . Roithinger et al ( 10 ) postulate mechanism AFL patient present arrhythmia could organization AF AFL . However , always possible determine predominate arrhythmia . In case , AFL ablation eliminate AF AFL , less extensive procedure AF ablation . As two arrhythmia inter-twined , possible AFL ablation alone may sufficient cure arrhythmia . Should AF ablation require later date , supportive data suggest second procedure associate additional complication . Therefore , perform AFL ablation alone expose patient unwarranted risk . ( 11 ) Several publish study report variety ablation strategy different type AF , include paroxysmal , persistent long stand persistent , variable result AF recurrence . ( 12-16 ) Compared previous study , scope APPROVAL study narrow include patient AF fall 'paroxysmal ' category . In randomized trial , Wazni et al compare outcome PV disconnection alone AF versus PV disconnection plus cavotricuspid isthmus ablation AFL . They conclude patient coexistent AF AFL , comparable long-term outcome term arrhythmia-free existence observe among patient undergo either AF ablation AF+AFL ablation . Performance lack performance AFL ablation along AF ablation , significantly affect long-term outcome . Therefore , APPROVAL study allow group 1 patient undergo AFL ablation undergo AFL ablation base physician discretion , belief AFL ablation set affect outcome . Ablation AFL treatment AF / AFL , follow anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy 3 month commonly use approach . QoL assessment focus physical , social emotional consequence illness . The subjective perception 'illness intrusiveness ' , disease burden affect general well-being great interest population . ( 17 ) Several standardized questionnaire available quantitatively assess QoL . In study , 4 use , namely Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Score ( HAD ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) . Study Objective : To compare long-term procedure-outcome , follow AF without AFL ablation versus AFL ablation alone , patient present PAF AFL . Study Design : This prospective , single blind randomize study would enroll 86 patient present document symptomatic PAF typical isthmus dependent AFL schedule undergo catheter ablation . Endpoints : Primary : Recurrence atrial arrhythmia : episode AF/AT longer 30 sec consider recurrence . Episodes occur first 3 month procedure ( blanking period ) consider recurrence . Secondary : Change QoL score baseline Study Procedures : Baseline : Consenting patient would randomly assign either AF±AFL ablation ( group 1 ) AFL ablation ( group 2 ) . In group 1 , AF ablation perform case . In addition , physician also perform AFL ablation one follow criterion meet : - The patient demonstrate spontaneous right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter upon arrival ablation procedure - Right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter inducible anytime ablation procedure - The patient spontaneous convert right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter anytime ablation procedure In group 2 , patient undergo ablation AFL . Because QoL could affect placebo effect procedure , patient blind group assignment . Baseline QoL survey collect patient prior ablation . Ablation Procedure : Standard map ablation technique conduct discretion physician , RF lesion administer location determine randomization assignment . This include pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) ablation extra-pulmonary trigger detect standard mapping procedure AF ( 18 ) cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation atrial flutter ( 2 ) . The endpoint procedure define termination non-inducibility AF AFL . Follow-up : Study follow-up last one year . Following ablation , patient discharge previously ineffective AADs continue 90 day ( blank period ) . The blanking period allow time inflammatory process subside . AADs discontinue blanking period patient . If patient suffers recurrence atrial arrhythmia , primary end point meet AAD therapy may administer discretion physician . Patients use event recorder 5 month ablation , ask transmit rhythm every time experience symptom compatible arrhythmia , least twice week even asymptomatic . Any episode AF/AT longer 30 sec 3 month blanking period consider recurrence . A 7 day Holter monitor wear 3 , 6 , 9 12 month time point procedure . QoL survey self-administered 3 12-month time point . Risk Analysis : This study pose additional risk patient . The risk group standard atrial fib flutter ablation . Per standard care , ablation procedure schedule pregnant patient . A pregnancy test routinely perform prior ablation procedure confirm patient pregnant . There risk associate study withdraw since study collect routine data , protocol specific follow-up procedure . Probability require repeat ablation : The probability arrhythmia recurrence ( AF and/or AFL ) AF ± AFL ablation report 52 % [ Scharf et al ( 19 ) ] 58 % [ Husser et al ( 20 ) ] . According Scharf et al , recurrence typical flutter alone AF ± AFL ablation 12 % . The recurrence typical flutter among patient undergo AFL ablation alone , report 11 % [ Bertaglia et al ( 21 ) ] 12 % [ Luca CT et al ( 22 ) ] . However , cumulative probability recurrence combine AF AFL AFL ablation population 50 % 2 year 58 % 3 year . ( 21 ) Therefore , overall probability go redo ablation AF ± AFL ablation compare AFL ablation alone significantly different ( 52 % vs 50 % , p &gt; 0.5 ) . Regarding risk associate repeat procedure , additional identifiable risk report patient undergoing second procedure ( 19 ) ( 23 ) . However , potential study subject advise standard procedural risk would present repeat procedure . These include cardiac tamponade CVA , esophageal fistula , pulmonary vein stenosis , bleeding , myocardial infarction , death injury cardiac conduction system . Benefits : The subject may incur benefit participate study . Statistical Methodology : Sample size determination power analysis : Reported success rate previous study use determine minimal difference outcome ( effect size ) . Published result indicate observed success rate ( freedom arrhythmia ) 65 % group 1 30 % group 2 . The sample size necessary detect effect size 35 % primary outcome determine use alpha = 0.05 power = 0.80 ( beta= 0.20 ) . The minimum required sample size ( two-sample parallel design test superiority model ) group come 43 patient . Sampling Plan : A central database create hold eligible subject . Permuted block randomization method use treatment allocation . Analysis Plan : The continuous variable report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . The categorical variable report number case ( n ) percentage . The bivariate analyse compare characteristic across two study group perform use Student 's t-test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . A stratified sub-analysis perform assess outcome across AF AF+CTI group multivariable risk-adjusted model . A two-tailed p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Time series analysis perform , use Kaplan Meier test multivariate analysis Cox proportional-hazards model , compare recurrence follow-up . SAS 9.2 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) use statistical analysis . Statistical test compare Group 1 &amp; 2 , well provide subanalysis Group 1 ( without AFL ablation ) .</detailed_description>
