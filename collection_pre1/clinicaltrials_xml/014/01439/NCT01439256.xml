	<brief_summary>This study focus important patient behavior , medication-taking , important physician behavior : promote medication regimen adherence patient appropriately modify therapy exist therapy result inadequate therapeutic effect . The study also explore caregiver ' ( clinician ) behavior relevant information patient ' medication adherence blood pressure control provide . The investigator focus behavior change patient physician seek change behavior improve health care delivery process outcomes .

	<brief_title>Telehealth &amp; Remote Measurement Technologies Improve Medication Adherence Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study use state-of-the-art technology , include two system use telephone-based platform call TLC ( Telephone-Linked Care ) . The two TLC application develop patient hypertension ( TLC-HTN ) well patient difficulty adhere medication regimen ( TLC-MED ) . The investigator also use state-of-the-art medication monitoring technology ( electronic pill tray ) monitor patient ' medication-taking behavior intervention control arm . The TLC-HTN system design patient hypertension ( HTN ) whose blood pressure ( BP ) control give home blood pressure monitor . All study subject ( intervention control ) ask take blood pressure home weekly basis . The system give feedback report blood pressure compare previous blood pressure value goal set physician . Using self-reported medication-taking behavior provide TLC-MED module , TLC-HTN give patient additional feedback link adherence blood pressure control . At end weekly TLC-HTN conversation , system send report patient 's physician display recent previous blood pressure value , identify trend , compare blood pressure physician 's goal patient accept norm , display anti-hypertensive medication use/adherence level similar manner physician could relate adherence blood pressure control . TLC-Medication Adherence ( TLC-MED ) : TLC-MED additional module add TLC chronic disease system include TLC-HTN , purpose promote medication regimen adherence . In TLC conversation , TLC-MED ass patient 's adherence medication prescribe disease . In project , investigator evaluate two version TLC-MED , one use electronic medication event monitoring system determine medication taking , use patient self-report information determine information . The investigator compare self-report method obtain medication-taking behavior/adherence electronic pill trays usual care . Commercially available electronic pill trays oral , solid medication ( e.g. , tablet capsule ) use arm assess patient medication adherence along subject self-report medication-taking . There number method conduct medication event monitoring solid medication . The investigator use electronic pill tray , consist pillbox contain 28 cup arrange 7x4 matrix . Each cup sensor register cup open .</detailed_description>
