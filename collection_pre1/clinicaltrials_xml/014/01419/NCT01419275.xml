	<brief_title>Quantifying Collateral Perfusion Cerebrovascular Disease-Moyamoya Disease Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early hour follow large vessel occlusion , ultimate severity stroke largely determine ability collateral flow network supply blood ischemic tissue via circuitous route bypass proximal clot . Robust collateral flow improve response thrombolytic therapy decrease risk intracranial hemorrhage . Despite central importance , collateral acute stroke poorly understood , largely assessment require invasive imaging test , cerebral angiography . This proposal assess whether noncontrast MRI perfusion technique , call arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) , yield important information collateral flow .</detailed_description>
