	<brief_summary>Delayed sleep phase syndrome ( DSPS ) common circadian rhythm sleep disorder ( CRSD ) . A person DSPS sufficient sleep quality , circadian clock delay compare normal 24-h period . They fall asleep around 03.00-04.00 night sleep 02.00-03.00 afternoon . This syndrome frequent among young people 16-25 year , conveys school attendance education affect , also often result severe social consequence . DSPS sometimes associate depression personality disorder may aggravate psychiatric symptom . This syndrome highly underdiagnosed detail guideline treat . The treatment usually consist light therapy , chronotherapy melatonin . There lack guideline often , wavelength , long treatment DSPS patient shall go . Previous study show light therapy often effective . The effect get even well melatonin administer concurrently . However , frequency relapse high . Thus , DSPS prevalent syndrome young adult severe consequence normal daytime functioning . There almost treatment option available health care setting . There clear need study topic . The main purpose present study evaluate clinical effect short long-term treatment use light therapy cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) . CBT recommend mild moderate depression anxiety . It also evidence treat insomnia . Patients DSPS often al symptom therefore investigator would like investigate CBT enhance effect light therapy . Firstly , investigator want evaluate short-term effect light therapy without CBT . Secondly , investigator want evaluate patient get CBT maintain `` normal '' sleep rhythm prevent relapse DSPS compare light therapy two week .

	<detailed_description>DSPS patient delay sleep wake time accompany insomnia excessive sleepiness result functional impairment . The sleeping-problems impairment important area function quality life sometimes lead psychiatric problem , depressive symptom , irritability , problem memory concentration . It yet fully establish long treatment go , long light treatment , exact intensity light . Although long-term study DSPS patient sparse , known clinical experience patient often fall back old circadian schedule treatment . This study prospective randomise study . In short-term study patient randomise two group . Group I light therapy ( LT ) two week Group II LT two week + CBT four week . Group I II follow questionnaire concern depression/anxiety , sleepiness day , sleep-diary insomnia-problems . The aim evaluate CBT enhance LT-treatment home . The two group follow sleep-diary monthly questionnaire . Method . Questionnaires . All patient fill questionnaire treatment start , treatment follow-up . I ) Horne-Ostberg Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire ( MEQ ) measure diurnality . II ) Insomnia Severity Scale ( ISI ) , scale measure severity insomnia III ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , scale measure habitual daytime sleepiness . IV ) Hospital anxiety- depression scale ( HADS ) V ) Penn state Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) VI ) Symptom-focused Rumination Scale ( SRS ) VII ) Brief COPE ( BC ) The questionaires give match reference group , without sleep problem . Light therapy : It today consider effective light intensity 10 000 lux approximately one foot person 30-45 minute . This treatment apply home . The exact time schedule light treatment decide individually depend patient 's sleep diary . Each day time light therapy bring back one hour earlier thereby get bed . CBT give 90-120 minute psychologist per week four week Sleep Department . The therapy give group 4-6 person . DLMO . DLMO take study start evaluate shift circadian rhythm . DLMO time endogenous melatonin reach threshold 3 ng/L 4 ng/L saliva . To measure melatonin saliva commonly use way determine DLMO since easy safe patient give value follow melatonin blood-value , three time low . The saliva test take hourly five hour , window suspect DLMO appear . It important saliva collection must do dim light condition ( less 10 lux ) .</detailed_description>
