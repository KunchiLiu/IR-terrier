	<brief_summary>An estimate 8 million individual America affect peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , blockages leg artery cause excruciate calf pain walking . PAD tremendous impact patient ' quality life . It also associate high rate heart attack premature death . While number treatment , previous study prospectively examine treatment pattern PAD seek systematically identify opportunity improve care . Most importantly , rigorous study examine impact disease patient ' perspective - symptom , function quality life - function different patient characteristic treatment . The PORTRAIT study ( Phase II ) systematically document treatment health status ( symptom , function quality life ) outcomes 840 US patient course one year ( assessment baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month ) 10 center address gap knowledge . It illuminate whether disparity treatment health status outcome exist function patient ' age , gender , race , socioeconomic psychological characteristic . PORTRAIT substantially elevate field identify critical gap way PAD currently manage , include potential disparity care , quality care improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent , undertreated atherosclerotic disease disproportionately poor cardiovascular prognosis , compare cardiovascular disease . Cardiac event , however , one manifestation PAD . Patients ' health status ( symptom , function , quality life ) critical outcome patient ' perspective . To date , systematic prospective evaluation disease-specific health status outcomes PAD vary treatment patient characteristic . The long-term goal work create evidence-based multi-modal PAD management program individualize patient . Following preparatory work Pilot PCORI grant 1 IP2 PI000753-01 , current proposal develop multi-center observational registry call PORTRAIT ( Patient-centered Outcomes Related Treatment Practices peripheral Arterial disease : Investigating Trajectories ) . PORTRAIT prospectively define relate patient ' care health status outcomes function treatment receive specialty clinic new-onset , exacerbation , PAD . We hypothesize substantial variability treatment pattern across provider patient characteristic explain much variation patient ' health status outcome . Four hypothesis-driven specific aim test ; 5th aim result direct deliverable study : Aim 1 : We hypothesize strong association severity patient ' health status use revascularization vary age , gender , race , socio-economic status . This aim examine variation treatment patient characteristic foundation identify disparity care . Aim 2 : We hypothesize revascularization associate rapid , large , improvement health status compare non-invasive option , benefit vary age , gender , baseline health status , smoke cessation , minority race , depressive symptom . The primary objective PORTRAIT quantify patient ' PAD-specific health status outcomes overall , function treatment patient characteristic . Aim 3 : We hypothesize variation performance measure adherence exist across provider , great adherence pharmacologic therapy prevention , exercise treatment improve function . We compare real world PAD care 4 PAD performance measure provide insight quality PAD care . Aim 4 : We hypothesize variation pharmacologic supervise exercise associate difference health status outcome provide evidence suggest failure prescribe evidence-based treatment result low health status score . Aim 5 : Use new information create educational tool assist patient select treatment .</detailed_description>
