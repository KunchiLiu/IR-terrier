	<brief_summary>This research examine effectiveness vitamin D placebo ( placebo tablet look like Vitamin D study drug , Vitamin D study drug ) , without physical activity ( walk progressive resistance exercise ) , treat bone loss woman undergone treatment breast cancer . The investigator would also like find physical activity program improve cardiovascular fitness , energy expenditure , muscular strength , muscle mass , balance . One hundred five ( 105 ) subject expect take part study . The investigator n't know bone loss breast cancer survivor treat differently bone loss woman .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must female primary diagnosis Stage I , II , III hormonereceptor positive breast cancer . Women must postmenopausal time enrollment . Must provide informed consent . Must willing discontinue use calcium and/or vitamin D supplement . Participants must ionize serum calcium level within normal limit ( 1.191.29mmol/L ) total correct serum calcium &lt; 10.6 mg/dl . Participants must slightly vitamin D deficient ( serum vitamin D level &lt; 32ng/ml ) Must functional capacity rating ≤ 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status assess baseline.132 Must approval treat physician ( physician 's nurse practitioner physician 's assistant ) participate submaximal physiological fitness test low moderate homebased walk progressive resistance exercise program receive 24week supplementation vitamin D. Must less five year diagnosis breast cancer must within 12 month start treatment aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) accordance American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) guideline . Subjects lifethreatening condition would preclude breast cancer treatment include chronic cardiac failure , unstable despite medication use , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , unstable coronary artery disease . Patients myocardial infarction within past year . Patients severe metabolic disorder , include phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , homocystinuria , Fabry 's disease , would preclude take calcitriol . Patients impaired renal function ( CRCL &lt; 60 mL/min ) kidney stone ( calcium salt ) within past 5 year . Patients hypercalcemia ( correct serum Ca ≥ 10.6 mg/dl ) history hypercalcemia vitamin D toxicity . Patients currently take calcium supplement aluminumbased antacid must willing discontinue use enroll study . Patients currently take vitamin D supplement must immediately discontinue use enroll study . Patients know sensitivity vitamin D. Patients severely vitamin D deficient ( &lt; 10 ng/ml ) . Women antiresorptive drug ( e.g . bisphosphonates ) within past year . Patients capable participate exercise intervention due severe knee arthrosis ligament/cartilage injury low extremity . Women malabsorptive syndrome ( i.e . cystic fibrosis , chronic pancreatitis ) take medication decrease absorption fat soluble vitamin ( i.e . Orlistat , Questran ) .</criteria>
