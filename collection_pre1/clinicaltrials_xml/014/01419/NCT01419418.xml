	<brief_title>Patients ' Perspectives Factors That Support Management Peripheral Arterial Disease Improved Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD ) affect many life year cancer , chronic low respiratory disease , accident diabetes mellitus combine . One three American adult ( 80,000,000 ) one type cardiovascular disease . Prevention management CVD public health goal , yet , remain major challenge . Even hypertension , easily detect usually controllable , 50 percent control rate . Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) one type CVD , affect eight million Americans also associate significant morbidity mortality . PAD increase age disproportionately affect African Americans . Interestingly , despite prevalence cardiovascular risk implication , 20 30 percent PAD patient undergo treatment . Medical management disease substantially contribute improved morbidity mortality . However , medical therapy successful patient need take medication adjust lifestyle , prescribe . Overall , `` typical adherence rate general population 50 percent medication much low lifestyle prescription behaviorally demand regimen '' . Few study investigate reaction thought regard efficacy therapies/interventions perspective participant . Meta analyse adherence also reveal patient ' perspective often absent present adherence theory successful explain non-adherence improve adherence . Therefore , important understand , perspective patient ; factor believe improve cardiac outcome emphasis adherence prescribed therapy . This qualitative study investigate question : What patient ' perspective factor support management cardiovascular condition improve outcomes Peripheral Arterial Disease population ? Cardiac outcomes interest health status define symptom burden , functional status , health relate quality life , patient ' perception quality care receive , experience living PAD .</detailed_description>
