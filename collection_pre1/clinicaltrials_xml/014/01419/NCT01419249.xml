	<detailed_description>This study open-label , interventional , retrospective , multicenter , international study , single-arm , non-randomized , non-controlled study . The subject 's trial participation include single visit . During visit , subject give consent participate trial undergo blood sample genetic marker test retrospective data collect relative first year subject 's r-hGH treatment . The r-hGH treatment follow subject indicated pediatric population , therefore subject include trial 18 year old . This study non-investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) trial therefore drug product data provide .</detailed_description>
