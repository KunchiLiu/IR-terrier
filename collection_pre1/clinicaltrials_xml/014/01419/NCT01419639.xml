	<brief_title>Phase II Study Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Children Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) clinical development since 1996 immunosuppressant solid organ transplantation obtain marketing authorization ( Certican® ) prophylaxis rejection renal cardiac transplantation number country , include majority European Union . Everolimus development patient various malignancy since 2002 . Everolimus 2.5mg , 5mg 10mg tablet approve trade name Afinitor® patient advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) failure treatment Sutent® ( sunitinib ) Nexavar® ( sorafenib ) US , EU several country undergo registration region worldwide . Afinitor® also recently approve treatment patient subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) associate tuberous sclerosis ( TS ) require therapeutic intervention candidate curative surgical resection . Everolimus investigate anticancer agent base potential act : 1 . Directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation ; 2 . Indirectly inhibit angiogenesis lead reduced tumor vascularity . For pediatric cancer patient , safety RAD001 establish phase 1 trial recommend phase II dose 5 mg/m2 daily . This exist pediatric data allow inclusion child phase 2 trial , important consideration since NF2 patient aggressive clinical course present school age . RAD001 recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment child adult subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) , benign brain tumor associate tuberous sclerosis ( TS ) . Although surgical resection effective tumor reduction , serious complication may follow radical resection , permanent deafness facial nerve damage . Most importantly , tumor often recur surgery . Radiation therapy ( RT ) propose alternative . However , safety efficacy NF2 population establish . A medical therapy option desperately need . This study single-center , 2-stage , phase II open-label study . All subject get RAD001 take continuously disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary objective study look objective response rate RAD001 patient NF2-related tumor include cranial nerve schwannomas , meningioma ependymomas . Participation consist screening/baseline visit ( ) , Day 1 , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 ; 12 cycle include standard care procedures medical history , vital sign , physical examination , ECGs , MRIs , audiograms , laboratory test . Novartis provide RAD001 free charge eligible study subject . The primary efficacy response study purpose great equal 15 % reduction tumor volume target tumor ( partial response ) . Complete disappearance target tumor constitute complete response ( CR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 3 year body surface area ≥ 0.5 m2 Meets diagnostic criterion NF2 At least one volumetrically measurable ≥ 0.5 cc NF2related brain spinal tumor ( schwannoma , ependymoma , meningioma histological confirmation require ) radiographic evidence progression ( either unequivocal progression conventional MRI , &gt; 10 % volume increase 3D volumetrics ) past ≤12 month , designate primary target tumor OR Volumetrically measurable ≥ 0.5 cc VS ipsilateral progressive hearing loss past ≤12 month , designate primary target tumor Progressive Hearing Loss Criteria Enrollment : Audiogram show drop pure tone average ( PTA ) 10dB HL ≥ 2 nonconsecutive consecutive frequency drop speech discrimination score ( SDS ) 95 % critical difference threshold , compare previous audiogram ≤ 1 year prior . Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ( PS ) 50100 % . Note : Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : 1. serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 2 . ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN INR ≤ 1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time enrollment . ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Fully recovered acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , biological modifier radiotherapy Any neurologic deficit must stable ≥ 1 week Able provide sign informed consent ( consent parent/legal guardian minor ) Patients currently receive medical anticancer therapy receive medical anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Radiation therapy study target tumor within 1 year prior enrollment , radiation therapy within 4 week prior enrollment . Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : 1 . Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV 2. unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease 3. severely impaired lung function define spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air 4. uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN ( Note : Optimal glycemic control achieve start trial therapy . ) 5. active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection 6. liver disease cirrhosis severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) . Note : A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . HBV DNA HCV RNA PCR test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection . A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption everolimus ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Adequate contraception must use throughout trial 8 week last dose study drug , sex . ( Females childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration everolimus ) Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) WOCBP willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity everolimus rapamycins ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol</criteria>
