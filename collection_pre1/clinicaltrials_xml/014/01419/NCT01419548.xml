	<brief_summary>Background : - Paclitaxel carboplatin two standard drug stop cancer cell reproduce . ABT-888 experimental cancer drug may prevent cancer cell `` fix '' damage do chemotherapy drug . This may make chemotherapy work well . More test need determine safety effectiveness ABT-888 plus chemotherapy . Researchers also want find best dose ABT-888 people kidney liver problem addition cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness ABT-888 plus carboplatin paclitaxel people cancer kidney liver problem . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment , also kidney liver problem . - A small group people solid tumor normal kidney liver function may also receive treatment study comparison purpose . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test , tumor sample , test liver kidney function , image study . Participants also provide hair sample start study . - Participants take one dose ABT-888 1 week start chemotherapy . The two chemotherapy drug give day 3 21-day cycle . Participants take ABT-888 daily first 7 day cycle . - They keep diary record medication dose side effect . They also frequent blood test image study . Participants provide hair sample day 3 cycle 1 paclitaxel . - Participants continue treatment 18 week long cancer stop grow shrink serious side effect . Participants may option continue treatment study do .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) family enzymes critical maintain genomic stability regulate variety DNA repair mechanism . The carboplatin/paclitaxel combination demonstrate wide spectrum clinical antitumor activity , make ideal platform evaluation novel agent , PARP inhibitor ABT-888 . Objectives : To determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ABT-888 patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 combination carboplatin paclitaxel patient vary degree liver kidney dysfunction . To provide dose recommendation ABT-888 combination carboplatin paclitaxel base degree hepatic renal impairment . To define dose-limiting toxicity toxicity associate use combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter ABT-888 , carboplatin paclitaxel administer combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . To evaluate pharmacodynamic measurement PAR platinum adduct peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) tumor cell associate use combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . Eligibility : Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective , expectation response combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( e.g. , lung , ovarian , breast , melanoma ) . Patients must adequate bone marrow function . Patients normal organ function , patient degrees renal dysfunction , patient mild severe hepatic dysfunction allow . Study Design : ABT-888 ( 80 mg ) give orally day -6 ( 1 day ) cycle 1 cohort . ABT-888 varying dos give day 1-7 cycle , dose depend patient 's degree renal hepatic dysfunction . Fixed dose chemotherapy give intravenously day 3 cycle . For patient renal dysfunction , carboplatin give AUC 6 paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 . For patient hepatic dysfunction , carboplatin give AUC 6 paclitaxel dos adjust patient 's degree hepatic dysfunction . The dose ABT-888 escalate determine MTD combination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective , expectation response combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( e.g. , lung , ovarian , breast , melanoma ) . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ABT888 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric phase 1 combination trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great eqaul 100,000/mcL hemoglobin great eqaul 8.0 g/dL Patients degrees renal dysfunction allow include patient hemodialysis . Patients mild severe hepatic dysfunction allow define : total bilirubin less eqaul 5 time ULN AND AST ALT less eqaul to10 time ULN For patient recently place biliary stent , patient consistent result within hepatic group two laboratory reading within 3 day apart , take least 10 day follow biliary stent placement . For patient biliary stent place 2 month ago , obstruction blockage occur within last 2 month . The effect ABT888 develop human fetus unknown . For reason therapeutic agent modality use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study whose adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier resolve stabilized . Patients administer ABT888 part single combination , Phase 0 I study , necessarily exclude participate study solely receive prior ABT888 . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ABT888 agent use study . Peripheral neuropathy severity great grade 1 . Inability take oral medication continuous basis . Evidence bleed diathesis . Patients brain metastasis stable disease least 4 week follow therapy brain metastasis ( surgery , radiotherapy stereotactic radiosurgery ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study ABT888 PARP inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ABT888 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ABT888 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential PK interaction ABT888 well possible interaction paclitaxel . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . However , HIVpositive patient without AIDSdefining diagnosis receive agent potential PK interaction ABT888 may eligible . Patients hepatic renal dysfunction also exclude . Patients receive progressed combination carboplatin/paclitaxel eligible .</criteria>
