	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give lenalidomide without rituximab work treat patient progressive relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) , non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving lenalidomide together without rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Rituximab Treating Patients With Progressive Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , Prolymphocytic Leukemia , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Previously Treated With Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve overall survival patient relapse NHL CLL/SLL/PLL within 180 day allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Rate response ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] ) time progression . II . Grade III-IV toxicity . III . Incidences grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) limit extensive chronic GVHD . IV . Compare efficacy safety first , second third cohort . V. Laboratory research study efficacy toxicity : blood sample store baseline , day 7 , day 28 cycle 1 day 28 cycle 3 investigate : 1. change plasma cytokine peripheral blood lymphocyte correlation treatment lenalidomide ; 2. pharmacokinetics rituximab ; 3. donor host polymorphism FCgamma RIIIa receptor impact disease response relapse . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients relapsed/progressed within 180 day post-transplant ( Cohort 1 ) , beyond day 180 post-transplant ( Cohort 2 ) , within 6 month start within 3 month relapse , receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ( patient CLL/SLL/PLL ) day 1-21 ( patient NHL ) . Patients Cohorts 1 2 also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 every two month course 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . ARM II : Patients relapsed/progressed time point post-transplant contraindication , prior severe hypersensitivity reaction rituximab infusion , receive rituximab CD20 negative disease ( Cohort 3 ) receive lenalidomide Arm I . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 60 day every 3 month 18 month .</detailed_description>
