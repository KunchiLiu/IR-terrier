	<criteria>Subject must least 18 year age . Subject ( legal guardian ) indicate understand trial requirement treatment procedure provide write informed consent trialspecific test procedure perform . Subject eligible percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Subject symptomatic coronary artery disease document silent ischemia . Subject acceptable candidate coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Subject leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥30 % measure within 60 day prior enrollment . Subject willing comply protocolrequired followup evaluation . Angiographic Target lesion must de novo lesion locate native coronary artery visually estimate reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) ≥ 2.25 mm ≤4.5 mm . Target lesion length must measure ( visual estimate ) follow : ≤28 mm stent diameter lengths 2.75 mm , 3.00 mm , 3.50 mm , 4.00 mm 4.50 mm ≤24 mm stent diameter lengths 2.25 mm 2.50 mm Target lesion must major coronary artery branch visually estimate stenosis ≥50 % &lt; 100 % Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) flow &gt; 1 . Target lesion must successfully predilated . Subject clinical symptom and/or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change consistent acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Subject unstable angina recent MI ( clinically diagnose within 3 day ) must creatine kinase ( CK ) / creatine kinasemyoglobin band ( CKMB ) troponin document prior procedure exclude follow criterion meet time index procedure : 1 . If CK MB &gt; 2× upper limit normal ( ULN ) , subject exclude regardless CK Total . 2 . If CK Total &gt; 2× ULN , CKMB must draw subject exclude CKMB abnormal . 3 . If CK/CKMB result available time procedure , subject exclude troponin &gt; 1× ULN subject least one following : Subject ischemic symptom ECG change indicative ongoing ischemia ( e.g. , &gt; 1 mm stent thrombosis ( ST ) segment elevation depression consecutive lead new left bundle branch block [ LBBB ] ) Development pathological Q wave ECG ; Imaging evidence new loss viable myocardium new regional wall motion abnormality Note : Subjects unstable angina recent MI must still CK/CKMB drawn prior index procedure . However , result subject need available prior index procedure exclusion criterion base study . Subject receive chronic ( ≥72 hour ) anticoagulation therapy ( e.g. , heparin , coumadin ) indication acute coronary syndrome . Subject platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 . Subject white blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3 . Subject document suspected liver disease , include laboratory evidence hepatitis . Subject dialysis know renal insufficiency ( e.g . serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ) . Subject active peptic ulcer disease , active gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed , bleed diathesis coagulopathy refuse transfusion . Subject cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within past 6 month , permanent neurologic defect may cause noncompliance protocol . Target vessel ( include side branch ) treat type PCI ( e.g. , balloon angioplasty , stent , cut balloon , atherectomy ) within 12 month prior index procedure . Target vessel treat within 10 mm proximal distal target lesion ( visual estimate ) type PCI ( e.g. , balloon angioplasty , stent , cut balloon , atherectomy ) time prior index procedure . Nontarget vessel side branch treat type PCI ( e.g. , balloon angioplasty , stent , cut balloon , atherectomy ) within 1 day prior index procedure . Note : 1 lesion nontarget vessel may treat index procedure prior treatment target ( study ) lesion . Planned actual target vessel treatment unapproved device , directional rotational coronary atherectomy , laser , cut balloon , transluminal extraction catheter immediately prior stent placement . Planned PCI CABG index procedure . Subject previously treat time coronary intravascular brachytherapy . Subject know allergy study stent system protocolrequired concomitant medication ( e.g. , stainless steel , platinum , chromium , nickel , iron , thienopyridines acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) ) contrast ( adequately premedicated ) . Subject serious medical illness ( e.g. , cancer , congestive heart failure ) may reduce life expectancy le 12 month . Subject current problem substance abuse ( e.g. , alcohol , cocaine , heroin , etc. ) . Subject planned procedure may cause noncompliance protocol confound data interpretation . Subject participate another investigational drug device clinical trial reach primary endpoint intend participate another investigational drug device clinical trial within 12 month index procedure . Subject female childbearing potential positive pregnancy test within 14 day index procedure , lactating , intend become pregnant study . Subject 1 target lesion , 1 target lesion 1 nontarget lesion , treat index procedure . Angiographic Target lesion meet follow criterion : Aortoostial location ( i.e. , lesion locate within 5 mm ostium visual estimate ) Left main location Located within 5 mm origin leave anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery leave circumflex ( LCX ) coronary artery Right Coronary Artery ( RCA ) visual estimate Located within saphenous vein graft arterial graft Will access via saphenous vein graft arterial graft Involves side branch ≥2.0 mm diameter visual estimate Involves side branch &lt; 2.0 mm diameter visual estimate clinically significant stenosis ostium TIMI flow 0 ( total occlusion ) TIMI flow 1 prior guide wire cross Excessive tortuosity proximal within lesion Extreme angulation proximal within lesion Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal target lesion moderately severely calcified visual estimate Restenotic previous intervention Thrombus , possible thrombus , present target vessel Target lesion cover single study stent ( unplanned bailout stenting allow ) Nontarget lesion treat index procedure meet follow criterion : Located within target vessel Located within bypass graft ( venous arterial ) Left main location Chronic total occlusion Involves complex bifurcation ( e.g. , bifurcation require treatment 1 stent ) Requires additional unplanned stent ( treatment nontarget lesion one stent permit long stent initially plan ) Treatment deem clinical angiographic success Treatment complete prior treatment target lesion Subject unprotected leave main coronary artery disease ( &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis ) . Subject protected left main coronary artery disease target lesion LAD LCX . Subject additional clinically significant lesion ( ) target vessel intervention within 12 month index procedure may require .</criteria>
