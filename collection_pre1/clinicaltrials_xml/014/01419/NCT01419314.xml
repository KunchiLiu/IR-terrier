	<brief_summary>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY ? The investigator want know wear pair splint night work bring pain help sleep good ( people live HIV/AIDS related neuropathy ) . HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE ? About 58 88 people take part study Harris County Hospital District ( HCHD ) . WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY ? As participant , assign one two treatment group . In one group , ask wear leg splint night wear liner splint . You ask answer question well sleep , long sleep , discomfort leg . The researcher help , investigator want answer question . You ask reach forward stand next wall walk 6 minute . The test de do random order . The session do beginning , week three week six . You finish test questionnaire hour less , total three hour six week investigator clinic . You receive instruction use splint liner liner alone home . You ask wear night next 6 week . Finally , principal investigator contact weekly phone , discus issue comfort ability adhere instruction provide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower Extremity Splinting Manage Pain Sleep Disturbances Associated With HIV/AIDS Related Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical management people live Human Immunodeficiency Virus ultimately lead development Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome progress dramatically since begin pandemic early 1980 's . Despite advance management prevention , estimate 33 million people worldwide infect virus . Of , 1.1 million people live HIV/AIDS reside United States , 56,000 new case add total every year . Medical provider challenge achieve delicate balance offer effective anti-retroviral therapeutic intervention monitoring undesired side effect age population `` People Living HIV/AIDS '' ( PLWA ) . Indeed , life expectancy PLWA continue increase industrialized world , approach parity non-infected individual . Pain sleep disturbance commonly associate chronic systemic disease fibromyalgia , arthritis , chronic liver disease HIV/AIDS . Data collect cohort 317 PLWA , indicate 55 % experienced ranked increase pain sleep disturbance among top four symptom associate living HIV/AIDS . Pain sleep disturbance precede report prevalence self-reported fatigue drowsiness . A review systemic disease ' impact sleep , suggest alteration rapid eye movement ( REM ) , non-REM sleep stage , well increase sleep disturbance associate HIV disease progression AIDS ; moreover , 26 % variance sleep disturbance experience PLWA study attribute pain psychosocial factor . Peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) among common complication associate long-term survival HIV/AIDS . It estimate 30-60 % PLWA develop PN point course disease , increase prevalence see patient population disease progress HIV AIDS . Functional impairment also report presence neuropathy . Different author report significant difference gait quality , walk speed total distance walk individual damage peripheral nervous system . Despite advance medical management HIV infection , direct impact commonly experience symptom associate living HIV/AIDS , pain sleep disturbance current era anti-retroviral therapy extensively report literature . In recent pilot study , conduct author colleague , use night time low extremity ( LE ) splinting show promising result management pain sleep disturbance . This pilot study design crossover study include 22 PLWA PN evaluate effect three-week bilateral low splint application pain sleep . A 20 % improvement pain sleep score report pilot study . Additionally , moderate effect size pain sleep score find . The result suggest analgesic effect splint application persist period several week follow discontinuation lower splint application . These result obtain use relatively small sample patient without long-term follow-up post-splinting application . Finally , study could determine whether source pain inhibition due application full contact protective sheath lower leg short-term immobilization ankle joint provide splint . Purpose Hypotheses Therefore , purpose primary aim study evaluate management pain sleep disturbance people live HIV/AIDS-related PN use bilateral LE splint versus control/placebo intervention bilateral LE splint liner application . The null hypothesis primary aim : - There difference pain sleep score bilateral LE splint obtain use splint liner follow three six-week application . - There difference pain sleep score baseline follow six-week LE splint application . The secondary aim identify factor influence function , measure functional reach test six-minute walk test ; relationship pain sleep disturbance presence HIV/AIDS relate neuropathy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult PLWA 18 old , clinical diagnosis symptomatic bilateral LE PN invite participate . The participant stable pain HIV/AIDS management regimen without foreseeable alteration change say pharmacological regimen , may include pain sleep medication . The participant community dwell individual , able walk modify independence level without need assistive device ambulate , cane walker . Eligible participant report least one follow clinical symptom : paresthesia , dysesthesia , report night cramp LE Participants exclude clinical diagnosis following : significant cardiovascular pulmonary disease ( specifically , myocardial infarction within past six month , angina , dyspnea rest ) , paraplegia , hemiplegia , major neurological dysfunction , diabetes , absent pedal pulse examination , sleep apnea , pregnant . Additionally , patient unable read English , patient change pharmacological management study use mechanical device assist normalize sleep exclude study .</criteria>
