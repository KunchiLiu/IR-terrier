	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) one common inherit disease worldwide exhibit high frequency people African descent . Patients SCD currently treatment option , hydroxyurea medication approve reduce frequency vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) prevent SCD complication acute chest syndrome . Once patient develop VOC , hospitalization aim alleviate pain ; specific therapy currently available otherwise affect course VOC . However , increase interest role coagulation pathogenesis SCD . The investigator hypothesize low dose anticoagulant therapy , prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) , could novel way ameliorate vaso-occlusive process thereby hasten resolution pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Sickle Cell Patients Hospitalized Pain Crisis With Prophylactic Dose Low-molecular-weight Heparin ( LMWH ) Versus Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind prospective randomize placebo control study enrollment target 100 patient . All subject SCD meet inclusion criterion inpatient , eligible study randomize receive prophylactic LMWH placebo . Treatment either LMWH ( dalteparin 5000 IU subcutaneously daily ) placebo occur initial 7 day hospitalization . Randomization occur within Investigational Drug Services , dispense label medication patient . All patient follow throughout hospitalization well outpatient clinic . The initial blood sample obtain within 36 hour admission . Following randomization , blood drawn perform : D-dimer , prothrombin fragment 1.2 , thrombin-antithrombin complex , Thrombin Generation Assay ( TGA ) . Blood drawn inpatient ( admission , day 3 , day 5 ) , well single outpatient follow-up visit two week post discharge . Patients prolonged hospitalization blood drawn admission , day 3 , day 5 , final blood draw outpatient ( least 14 day discharge ) . Treatment prophylactic LMWH placebo occur initial 7 day hospitalization discharge . Clinical pain score perform twice daily throughout initial 7 day hospitalization patient . The primary pain assessment tool 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale ( VAS ) , `` 0 '' correspond pain one end `` 10 '' indicate bad pain . The VAS test administer blind study coordinator PI throughout study , use standardized instruction . Pain also assess follow outpatient visit ( confirm patient 's pain return baseline ) . Patients recommend follow outpatient clinic approximately 2-4 week follow hospitalization . At time , patient examine , clinical pain score determine , final blood draw test detailed . Should patient return within 4 week , patient contact phone determine clinical status .</detailed_description>
