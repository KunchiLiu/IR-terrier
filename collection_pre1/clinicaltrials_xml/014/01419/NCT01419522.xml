	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people traumatic brain injury difficulty walk . Training treadmill often use help people walk difficulty . Supporting person body weight harness use treadmill help improve walk skill people brain injury . Varying rate people walk treadmill may also help walk constant rate . Treadmill train body weight support walk different speed may improve walk skill people traumatic brain injury . More research need see one method well . Objectives : - To compare effect two type treadmill train people traumatic brain injury . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age mild moderate traumatic brain injury least 6 month ago mild moderate walking difficulty . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also take basic walk test ( treadmill ) . - Participants divide two group . The first group treadmill train constant speed . The second group treadmill train different speed . All participant wear support harness walk treadmill . - At first train visit , participant gait assessment different test walk . Then treadmill walk session . - After first visit , participant return twice week 6 week treadmill train session ( visit 3 12 ) . They also grip strength walking test . - At end 6 week , participant final treadmill training session , gait assessment exactly like one first train visit . - At 6 month final session , participant followup visit final gait assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : To test effectiveness use time vary walk velocity Body-Weight Supported Treadmill Training ( BWSTT ) compare use constant velocity subject Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) . We hypothesize use time vary velocity result great improvement ambulatory function . Study Population : 30 adult subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating TBI functional deficit gait enrol . Subjects recruit NIH , affiliate hospitals/clinics , community . Design : This pilot study use instrument treadmill ( Bertec Co. , Columbus , Ohio ) force control harness system call ZeroG ( Aretech LLC , Ashburn , Virginia ) . Subjects randomly assign one two group ( 12 subject per group ) : first group receive BWSTT constant velocity ( also know standard treadmill training ) ; second group receive BWSTT randomize time vary velocity . BWSTT time vary velocity consist two component : 1 ) subject passively adjust walk speed continuously change speed treadmill ; 2 ) subject actively change walk speed follow instructed walk speed display monitor screen treadmill automatically adjust subject speed . Each group receive 8 gait training session ( 30 minute per session , twice per week ) four week . Gait performance test ( pre-test ) ( post-test ) 8 session gait training program . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure parameter represent gait performance : maximum walk speed , self-selected walk speed , cadence , stride length , percentage swing , stance double stance period , gait symmetry , Time Up Go ( TUG ) , Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) score . The secondary outcome measure physical cognitive effort exert training session evaluate grip-strength test LNS ( Letter-Number Sequencing ) test .</detailed_description>
