The MOD consist 3 subscales measure lung , nutrition-hydration psychological consequence patient swallow difficulty . Unlike expensive complex test , MOD design in- outpatient . This research validate MOD subscale ensure retention item reliable valid use patient dysphagia due disease etiology . The final MOD subscales first allow clinician track medical complication patient ensure treatment effective . Globally , MOD subscales direct limited health care resource effective treatment swallow disorder .</brief_summary>
