	<detailed_description>STRUCTURED RESEARCH ABSTRACT Introduction Patients present ED ( emergency department ) undifferentiated , non-trauma associate hypotension often affect condition prognosis largely dependent time take presentation correct diagnosis intervention . The ACES protocol ( Abdominal Cardiothoracic Evaluation Sonography Shock ) provide rapid focus ultrasound protocol make refining diagnosis patient present ED type hypotension . This first study compare clinical outcome patient assess ACES protocol part initial workup patient assess without intervention ultrasound . The goal study determine ACES enhance patient 's clinical outcome , measure : 1 ) Time restoration ( improvement ) CVS ( cardiovascular system ) parameter , 2 ) Rate normalization acid-base balance , well venous lactate 3 ) Significant change diagnosis recommend intervention 4 ) Frequency unexpected diagnosis , 5 ) Patient 7 30-day , discharge mortality rate . Methods SHoC-ED 1 stratified randomize control trial run multiple center across Canada internationally . The data stratify center involve recruit equal amount control intervention patient . While different center recruit different number participant , individual center recruit near-equal amount arm study . ED nurse identify potential candidate SHoC-ED 1 study , flag chart notify attend physician . ED Physicians train ACES protocol proceed review exclusion criterion ( part patient inclusion sheet/patient flag ) appropriate , obtain consent . After complete , physician retrieve envelope contains already randomize form appropriate whichever arm patient randomize . This randomization place patient either ACES group ( refer Group 1 ) , control group ( refer Group 2 ) . Physicians follow group 1 protocol perform normal initial assessment ACES , record data step . Physicians group 2 simply record data initial assessment . Both group physicians record impression 60 minute enable project determine change diagnosis affect non-ultrasound factor first hour patient ED . These diagnosis compare `` final '' diagnosis make patient 's admission . Exclusion criterion study include follow : A ) necessity CPR advance life support intervention enrollment , B ) History significant trauma past 24 hour , C ) A 12 lead ECG diagnostic STEMI , D ) Mechanism shock clear ( i.e . undifferentiated shock ) , E ) previously know diagnosis hospital , F ) previously confirm pregnancy , G ) vagal episode H ) Low blood pressure actually pathologic hypotension , instead normal variant phenomenon . To ensure scan perform properly consistently sit include study local principal investigator responsible ensure appropriate training monitoring standard physician center perform ACES . The data collect Group 1 Group 2 compare , follow-up conduct ascertain early intervention ACES implication long-term outcome . Results Given much data interpret compare numerical value different stratum ( Example : Time take operate theatre compare Group 1 2 ) , ANOVA test use . The result ANOVA test use determine significant difference outcome , measure 1 ) Time restoration ( improvement ) CVS parameter , 2 ) Rate normalization acid-base balance ( use either venous arterial blood gas ) , blood lactate . For categorical data ( Example : Mortality rate group ) , chi-square analysis perform determine statistically significant increase clinical outcome . This do : - Significant change diagnosis/recommendations intervention change , - Frequency unexpected diagnosis . Conclusion This SRCT ( stratify randomize control trial ) determine whether ACES protocol lead improved clinical outcome patient present ED undifferentiated , non-trauma associate shock . It compare intervention ACES protocol intervention ultrasound .</detailed_description>
