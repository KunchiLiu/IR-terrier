	<brief_summary>There 24 million people diabetes mellitus ( DM ) United States . Over one-third patient present coronary angiography know DM , additional 20 % patient without know DM present hyperglycemia day coronary angiography . Hyperglycemia set urgent elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) associate 40 % relative increase long-term mortality regardless diabetic status . Mechanisms link periprocedural hyperglycemia adverse outcome poorly understood effect treatment unknown . This pilot study aim determine effectiveness , feasibility safety continue long-acting hypoglycemic medication morning coronary angiography . Since hyperglycemia may cause increased platelet reactivity , secondary aim evaluate possible mechanism benefit periprocedural glycemic control platelet activity . Patients DM hypoglycemic medication undergo coronary angiography randomize either continue hold clinically-prescribed long-acting hypoglycemic medication day procedure . Patients without DM randomize either routine care additional glycemic control Yale insulin infusion protocol 6 hour post-PCI . The primary endpoint study mean blood glucose level time arterial access hold versus continue group . Secondary endpoint mean blood glucose level 6 hour post-PCI Yale versus routine care group number hypoglycemic event glycemic control versus glycemic control group . The exploratory analysis assess effect glycemic control platelet activity guide study evaluate translation individual 's platelet phenotype clinical risk increase long-term mortality follow PCI . The outcome study ( glucose level platelet function ) measure hospital stay average 1 day .</brief_summary>
