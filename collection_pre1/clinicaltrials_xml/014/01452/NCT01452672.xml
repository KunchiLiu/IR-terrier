	<brief_summary>This study compare two different field set-ups patient breast cancer follow breast resection ( mastectomy ) . These two set-ups follow : arm - radiotherapy chest-wall , arm b - radiotherapy chest-wall supraclavicular fossa . Patients treatment arm receive radiotherapy shorten fractionation schedule . Study hypothesis : irradiation chest-wall inferior irradiation chest-wall supraclavicular fossa term loco-regional control , survival treatment toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resource-sparing Post-mastectomy Radiotherapy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-mastectomy radiotherapy ( PMRT ) substantially reduce risk loco- regional failure show several study meta-analyses . Two large trial pre-menopausal node-positive breast cancer patient treat mastectomy chemotherapy show PMRT reduce loco- regional failure rate also improve disease-free overall survival rate . Although benefit PMRT clear , optimal volume tissue cover radiotherapy field controversial . Since chest wall likely location recurrence , uniform consensus chest wall irradiate . However , area controversy exist regard irradiation regional lymph node ( axillary , supraclavicular internal mammary lymph node ) , optimal radiation dose , dose-fractionation . If equivalent result could achieve omit irradiation supraclavicular region patient receive adjuvant systemic therapy , simplify expedite treatment patient population . Furthermore , use shorten fractionation schedule 40 Gy 15 fraction ( 2.67 Gy per fraction ) 3 week use UK Canada post-mastectomy patient several decade shorten duration treatment reduce number patient visit radiotherapy increase number patient treat . Treatment convenient patient reduction number treatment could result saving strain health care system . This randomized comparison two different radiotherapy field set-ups post-mastectomy treatment locally advance breast cancer . Patients undergone modify radical mastectomy include axillary lymph node dissection randomize receive one two radiotherapy treatment arm , A B follow completion adjuvant chemotherapy . The radiotherapy treatment Arm A consist irradiation chest wall Treatment Arm B include irradiation chest wall ipsilateral supraclavicular field . Patients treatment arm receive radiation shorten fractionation schedule . Patients evaluate local control , regional control , survival treatment toxicity .</detailed_description>
