	<brief_summary>Young child present Emergency Department ( ED ) wheeze often prolong stay ED even get admitted hospital . This prospective observational study investigator use bedside 2D ultrasound evaluate lung ultrasound finding child le 24 month present ED wheezing . The investigator hypothesize child less 24 month present Emergency Department wheeze range lung ultrasound finding include normal finding , B line , subpleural consolidation , pleural effusion . The investigator also hypothesize finding reproducible two equally trained provider . The investigator also hypothesize lung ultrasound finding patient 0-24 month present ED wheeze correlate specific clinical outcome . An exploratory analysis perform look correlation lung US finding acute severity , final diagnosis , present symptom , prematurity , risk factor atopy , response treatment radiologic viral study perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bedside Lung Ultrasound Young Children Presenting Emergency Department ( ED ) With Wheezing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To qualify lung US finding convenience sample young child present ED bronchiolitis review second provider determine reproducibility finding . reproducibility finding . Hypothesis 1a : Children le 24 month present Emergency Department wheeze range lung ultrasound finding include normal finding , B line , subpleural consolidation , pleural effusion . Hypothesis 1b : Findings reproducible two equally trained provider . Specific Aim 2 : The frequency B line , subpleural consolidation , pleural effusion lung US convenience sample patient 0-24 month present ED wheeze quantify use continuous variable mean standard deviation . An exploratory analysis perform look correlation lung US finding clinical outcome include discharge ED admission hospital , include intensive care unit , length stay ED . A exploratory analysis do look correlation lung ultrasound finding acute severity , final diagnosis , present symptom , prematurity risk factor atopy . Hypothesis 2a : The presence B line , subpleural consolidation , pleural effusion lung US convenience sample patient 0-24 month present ED wheeze correlate specific clinical outcome . Hypothesis 2b : The presence B line , subpleural consolidation , pleural effusion lung US convenience sample patient 0-24 month present ED wheeze positively correlate history prematurity negatively correlate history consistent atopy .</detailed_description>
