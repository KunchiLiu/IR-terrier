	<brief_summary>The objective RAPID STEMI study evaluate feasibility , efficacy , safety pharmacogenetic approach anti-platelet therapy treatment ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) use point-of-care genetic testing CYP2C19*2 , *17 , ABCB1 3435 C &gt; T allele .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Approach Anti-platelet Therapy Treatment ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual anti-platelet therapy follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment STEMI traditionally consist aspirin clopidogrel . Despite treatment approach , substantial portion patient experience recurrent adverse cardiovascular event include death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis . This persistent vulnerability associate inadequate platelet inhibition response clopidogrel administration , phenomenon refer high on-treatment platelet reactivity . Although multiple variable implicate alter clopidogrel response , mount evidence suggest crucial role common genetic variant include : CYP2C19*2 , *17 , ABCB1 3435 C &gt; T allele . Presence CYP2C19*2 allele associate 1.5- 6-fold increase risk cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis follow PCI patient treat clopidogrel . These finding , recently bolster 2 separate meta-analyses , lead American Food Drug Administration issue box warn clopidogrel state poor metabolizers may receive full benefit drug . The ABCB1 3435 TT genotype also link increased adverse cardiovascular event individual treat clopidogrel follow PCI acute coronary syndrome . In contrast , CYP2C19*17 gain-of-function allele appear enhance activity clopidogrel associate reduced ischemic event increase bleed . As result finding , expert begin advocate routine genotyping context PCI . A personalized approach dual anti-platelet therapy follow PCI feasible give presence treatment alternative prasugrel capable overcome clopidogrel resistance . Selective administration prasugrel patient increase risk clopidogrel resistance potential successfully minimize adverse ischemic event , simultaneously minimize associate bleed event health care cost . A prospective pharmacogenomic approach anti-platelet therapy previously hamper limited access time-delay associate genetic testing . The development point-of-care genetic testing CYP2C19*2 , *17 , ABCB1 3435 C &gt; T alleles require minimal train perform carry potential overcome obstacle may facilitate incorporation pharmacogenetic strategy routine clinical practice . Patients receive PCI context STEMI undergo point-of-care genetic testing CYP2C19*2 , *17 , ABCB1 3435 C &gt; T allele . CYP2C19*2 carrier individual homozygous ABCB1 3435 T allele subsequently randomize prasugrel 10mg daily 1 month clopidogrel 150mg daily 1 week follow 75mg daily . The remain individual without at-risk genotype receive standard therapy clopidogrel . At end 1 month period , efficacy treatment strategy evaluate use VerifyNow platelet function test . The effect CYP2C19*17 allele prospectively evaluated treatment period .</detailed_description>
