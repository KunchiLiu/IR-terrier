	<detailed_description>Introduction : Bariatric surgery appear effective solution improve health morbidly obese individual . However , intervention associate risk could lower pre-surgery intervention . According study , low physical capacity surgery link small weigh loss surgery increase risk peri-surgical complication . Practice regular physical activity obese individual improve physical capacity . No specific recommendation physical activity prescription currently available reduce fitness population . This project aim evaluate Pre-Surgical Physical Activity Training ( PreSPAT ) improve physical capacity , surgery effectiveness decrease peri-surgical complication morbidly obese individual . Hypotheses : In bariatric surgery patient , PreSPAT improve : - subjects'health ( physical capacity , weight , comorbidities , quality life ) - subject ' motivation regular physical activity , perceive benefit barrier physical activity include pain , discomfort dyspnea satisfaction physical activity management - duration surgery complication - postoperative management ( duration , complication , re-operation , re-hospitalization ) . These two last item probably require large population future project complete data conclusive . Materials method : This pilot project divide 2 phase : Phase 1 : Ten candidate bariatric surgery include phase . In pre-training focus group , subject interviewed expectation availability PreSPAT . These result combine literature use design PreSPAT . To measure effectiveness , anthropometric parameter , body composition , physical capacity , motivational stage , perceive benefit barrier face physical activity quality life evaluate PreSPAT . Subjects satisfaction physical activity intervention measure questionnaire 6 week end PreSPAT . Phase 2 : 50 candidate bariatric surgery randomize 2 group : Control group : receive usual care integrate medical surgical treatment obesity clinic Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke , include individual counselling exercise physiologist every 6 week . Intervention group : attend three month surgery session supervise physical activity develop phase 1 addition usual care integrate medical surgical treatment obesity clinic . Physical capacity , anthropometry , body composition , readiness change , comorbidities , perceive benefit barrier physical activity , usual practice physical activity , quality life patient satisfaction physical activity intervention evaluate two group intervention every 3 month surgery one year .

Phase 2 project may generate information improve management obese candidate bariatric surgery order ensure optimal result health . This project also allow good understand criterion lead successful surgery effect exercise train morbidly obese individual .</detailed_description>
