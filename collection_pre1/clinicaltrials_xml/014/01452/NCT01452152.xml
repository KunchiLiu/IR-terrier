	<brief_summary>It standard treatment take anti-platelet medication cardiac catheterization stent placement help prevent formation blood clot may cause heart attack stroke . The commonly use anti-platelet medicine clopidogrel ( Plavix® ) . However , researcher find people vary response clopidogrel , part difference gene . Prasugrel ( Effient® ) another anti-platelet medication use prevent clot . The genetic difference affect clopidogrel response affect prasugrel response . Recently , FDA add warn label clopidogrel notify doctor patient certain genetic difference may get full benefit clopidogrel . Despite , genetic test variation usually do standard medical practice . The purpose study see patient certain gene difference few major cardiac event stent placement give anti-platelet therapy guide individual genetic type compare standard anti-platelet therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Anti-platelet Intervention-2 ( PAPI-2 ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over three-year period , total 7,200 patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) dual anti-platelet therapy indicate least one year meet eligibility criterion , recruit five clinical site . Patients present cardiac clinic , emergency department , catheterization laboratory , acute care unit ( e.g . CCU ) coronary angiography angiography PCI offer participation . Following informed consent , patient baseline data specimen collect , eligibility confirm . Patients randomize equal number G-D arm SOC arm . Immediately follow randomization , blood sample patient assign G-D arm send CYP2C19 genotype analysis . Upon receipt CYP2C19 genotype result , patient randomize G-D arm CYP2C19 *1/*1 genotype ( extensive metabolizers ) *1/*17 , *17/*17 genotype ( ultrarapid metabolizers ) receive clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin 81-162 mg/day ( group ) . Those *1/*2 , *1/*3 , *2/*17 , *3/*17 genotype ( intermediate metabolizers ) *2/*2 , *2/*3 , *3/*3 genotype ( poor metabolizers ) receive prasugrel 5-10 mg/day plus aspirin 81-162 mg/day ( group b ) . Patients randomize SOC arm genotyped prospectively . They receive dual anti-platelet therapy guide judgment treat physician accord standard medical practice irrespective genotype ( group c ) . Optionally , subgroup patient return 10 day randomization visit platelet aggregation study . If hypothesis correct , i.e. , intermediate poor metabolizers , G-D anti-platelet therapy result few cardiovascular event less equivalent bleed complication compare SOC therapy , cost effective , prospective randomize clinical trial provide evidence base implement genotype-directed anti-platelet treatment algorithms broadly clinical practice .</detailed_description>
