	<detailed_description>Background An alteration pancreatic blood flow may important number clinical condition . Reduction blood flow see patient acute chronic pancreatitis quantification perfusion may useful management pancreatic malignancy assessment pancreatic transplant . Unfortunately , measurement pancreatic blood flow technically difficult due anatomical location organ complex blood supply . The pancreas receives blood supply rich plexus artery foremost arterial supply arise splenic pancreaticoduodenal artery , superior inferior . Various method use attempt quantify blood flow potential drawback . The use endoscopic laparoscopic method invasive use intravenous contrast medium . Furthermore , use compute tomography expose patient ionise radiation . As arterial supply pancreas complex , measure single artery flow provide accurate measure perfusion . Furthermore , name branch supply artery secondary tertiary branch major vessel , narrow arterial diameter precludes accurate radiological measurement . Arterial Spin Labelling ( ASL ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , hand validate technique allow accurate measurement visceral perfusion . Transient physiological change occur pancreatic blood flow secondary increase demand eat . Changes also induce pharmacologically use pancreatic stimulating agent , secretin . This naturally occur peptide produce within S cell proximal small bowel mucosa . It cause increase bicarbonate secretion duct cell pancreas biliary tract via oxygen dependant cyclic AMP mediate pathway . Secretin use previously assess alteration blood flow use clinically assessment sphincter Oddi dysfunction conjunction magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography . Aims Hypothesis This pilot study aim evaluate MRI technique measure pancreatic perfusion blood flow rest secretin stimulation healthy volunteer , prior evaluation chronic pancreatitis patient group . Experimental protocol method Volunteers recruit advertisement place designated University Nottingham notice board . All volunteer complete questionnaire abdominal symptom , Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HAD ) patient health questionnaire 15 ( PhQ15 ) . Each volunteer attend 1.5T Brain Body Imaging centre University Nottingham Campus study evaluation . Following overnight fast baseline MRI scan undertaken . Volunteers receive 1 IU/kg secretin ( Sanochemia Pharmazeutika AG , Wien , Germany ) via intravenous route 3 minute . The volunteer scan 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 40 min follow stimulus . MRI scan carry Philips 1.5T Achieva MRI scanner locate Brain Body Imaging Centre University Nottingham . The volunteer place supine scanner receiver body coil wrap around abdomen . All image analysis carry use commercial and/or house package . Outcome measure baseline follow secretin stimulation : 1 . Pancreatic perfusion 2 . Superior mesenteric artery blood flow 3 . Gastroduodenal artery blood flow 4 . Hepatic artery blood flow 5 . Splenic artery blood flow</detailed_description>
