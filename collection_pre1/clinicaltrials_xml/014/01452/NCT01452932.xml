	<brief_summary>Objective : To estimate effectiveness muscle training , degree dyspnea aerobic capacity patient 50 COPD , health care institution provider Antioquia . Question : What effectiveness muscle training , degree dyspnea aerobic capacity COPD patient 50 year , health service institution provider department Antioquia ? Hypothesis : Muscle training cause change degree dyspnea aerobic capacity , breathe exercise relaxation Design : Randomized clinical trial allocation blind autcomes assesor . Participants : COPD patient stage II II , male female , 50 year old , attend community health service provider department Antioquia . Intervention : A physiotherapeutic intervention use PNF technique apply experimental physiotherapy group versus Yoga session apply group . Twelve week protocol perform three session per week . Outcome measure : Dyspnea degree aerobic capacity measure use MMRC scale six minute walk test respectively begin end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) define GOLD ( The Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ) disease process characterize progressive airflow limitation associate abnormal inflammatory response lung particle harmful gas fully reversible . This restriction generate expiratory flow air entrapment result hyperinflation , couple effect systemic , structural change occur skeletal muscle lead great fatigue cause dyspnea . Consequently , patient COPD require participation accessory muscle respiration , dual function activity involve upper limb , supply ventilatory requirement movement shoulder girdle , increase dyspnea carry patient stop activity , lead physical deconditioning progressively decrease aerobic capacity . This demonstrate need improve resistance upper limb muscle patient , thus contribute reduction degree dyspnea improve aerobic capacity . The investigator propose study aim determine effectiveness muscle training degree dyspnea aerobic capacity COPD .</detailed_description>
