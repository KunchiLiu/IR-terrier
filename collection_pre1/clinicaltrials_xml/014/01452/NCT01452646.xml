	<brief_title>Risk-adapted , MRD-directed Therapy Young Adults With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general objective study set multicentre , risk-adapted study relies pre-treatment cytogenetic/genetic feature post-consolidation assessment Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) establish final risk assignment treatment younger ( ≤ 60 year ) patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) . Aim clinical trial verify whether delivery post remission therapy whose intensity risk-driven improve outcome term increase anti-leukemic efficacy reduce therapy-related toxicity . All patient receive induction consolidation chemotherapy accord Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto ( GIMEMA ) LAM99P protocol . After first consolidation , patient belong low-risk category ( core binding factor positive AML without c-Kit mutation , NPM1 positive FLT3 negative AML ) receive autologous stem cell transplantation , patient high-risk feature ( adverse-risk karyotype , FLT3-ITD mutation ) , assign allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Patients FLT3-TKD mutation c-Kit mutate core binding factor positive AML belong intermediate-risk karyotype category stratify accord MRD flow cytometry receive risk-adapted treatment ( autologous vs. allogeneic stem cell transplantation ) . All patient meet criterion high-risk definition offer allogeneic transplantation option regardless availability Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) identical sibling . In fact , lack HLA identical sibling source hematopoietic stem cell ( match unrelated donor international registry , unrelated cord blood , family haploidentical donor ) consider . Autologous allogeneic stem cell transplantation perform within 3 month end consolidation therapy .</detailed_description>
