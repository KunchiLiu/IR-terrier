	<brief_summary>In past many author report abnormal contact rotator cuff coracoacromial arch , exact etiology clearly understood . Thus , objective study relate specifically improve symptom rehabilitation shoulder function patient : 1 . Assess effectiveness magnet therapy treatment impingement rotator cuff ; 2 . Assess whether application magnetic therapy 3 time week three week , may effective single treatment impingement rotator cuff ; 3 . Assess whether combination magnetic therapy therapeutic exercise effective magnetic therapy ; 4 . Evaluate benefit magnetic therapy associate therapeutic exercise short long term . 5 . Assess effectiveness modulation pulse electromagnetic field 25 Hz 20 mT patient shoulder impingement syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Randomization patient 1.1 ) Duration wash-out Having make proper screening patient undergo study , pre-selected patient discontinue medication might influence symptoms impingement syndrome ( analgesic , antiinflammatory , chondroprotective , etc . ) period 7 day . 1.2 ) Randomization The investigator choose total sample 30 patient undergoing study . Only one treat shoulder patient , case bilateral impingement syndrome ( IS ) . Patients equally distribute two group , receive first place : Group 1 : treatment magnetic therapy , three time per week last 30 minute session . Group 2 : placebo magnet therapy ( MT ) , three time per week last 30 minute session . Randomization do follow : initially 10 patient select evaluate blinded evaluator end evaluation , patient randomly choose paper fold 2 part , inside plastic bag . Inside bag 10 paper fold way color size , three say `` A '' , two write `` B '' , three write `` C '' two `` D '' . Patients drawn paper write `` A '' `` D '' select group 1 patient raffle paper write `` B '' `` C '' select group 2 . After draw paper , place back bag . Randomization do way patient also divide two group blind assessor know group patient allocate . 2 . PLAN OF STUDY 2.1 ) Assessment 1 : Patients select study refer outpatient musculoskeletal physiotherapy diagnosis impingement syndrome grade II grade III . All evaluate blind investigator , use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , rating scale Constant University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) shoulder rating scale , measurement rotator cuff muscle force ( external internal rotation ) shoulder elevation . 2.2 ) Assessment 2 : After 3 week treatment application magneto therapy , new assessment equal evaluation make assessor blind , know patient expose placebo . After third evaluation , patient continue session magnetic therapy ( placebo ) , associate specific therapeutic exercise treatment impingement syndrome shoulder . The assessment consist two re-evaluation parameter previously evaluation . 2.3 ) Evaluation 3 : The third evaluation happen three week treatment magnetic therapy exercise blind assessor evaluate patient manner evaluation 1 2 . After evaluation , patient receive high treatment receive booklet exercise help practice proper exercise shoulder home . 2.4 ) Evaluation 4 : The fourth review occur six month third evaluation , main objective evaluate efficacy treatment without guidance physiotherapist without weekly application magnetic therapy . - Application method : The investigator choose total sample 30 patient undergoing study . Only one treat shoulder patient , case bilateral impingement syndrome . Patients equally distribute two group , receive first place : Group 1 : treatment magnetic therapy , three time per week last 30 minute session . Group 2 : placebo magnet therapy , three time per week last 30 minute session.After first 3 week application magnetic therapy , begin program therapeutic exercise ( kinesiotherapy ) equally patient group . These exercise conduct application magnetic therapy patient receive brochure guide perform exercise home . The application magnetic therapy continue 3 time per week 30 minute duration application , time associate exercise , treatment do another 4 week . After four week , patient reassess scale Constant UCLA evaluate overall function shoulder receive placebo treatment magneto .</detailed_description>
