	<brief_title>Study Compare Reduction Pain After Surgery With Without Local Anesthesia During Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The literature divide efficacy preincisional local analgesia injection laparoscopic port site decrease post operative pain . One reason lack clear conclusion fact prior study include small large port size . Many small port sit little pain associate show reduction medicine statistically difficult . The investigator note large , lateral port site require fascial closure sit patient consistently note pain . Our protocol include use 0.25 % marcaine injection surgical port large lateral port use gynecologic laparoscopy . Patients would randomize surgeon would blind patient receive marcaine saline injection large lateral port site . Visual analog pain scale assess 4 24 hour surgery . An additional two arm add include 50 patient randomize 0.25 % marcaine saline injection prior incisional closure absence preincisional intervention .</detailed_description>
