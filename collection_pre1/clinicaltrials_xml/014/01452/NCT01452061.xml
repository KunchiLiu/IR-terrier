	<brief_summary>There three purpose study . The first purpose evaluate value genetic test determine risk autism spectrum disorder . Processing genetic sample complete Cleveland Clinic use research equipment provide IntegraGen . The second purpose identify genetic change may associate autism spectrum disorder attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder . The third purpose examine whether genetic difference change may predict individual benefit medicine use treat attention problem psychiatric difficulty . Between 600-800 people expect participate study - approximately 300 individual autism spectrum disorder , 75 individual attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder another developmental psychiatric disorder , 100 healthy sibling , 125 unrelated individual without developmental psychiatric disorder . Study procedure vary base upon specific group participant suspect fall ( autism , attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder , psychiatric concerns/developmental delay , healthy sibling , unrelated healthy control ) . - All individual ask participate cheek swab ( gently swab inside cheek ) obtain cell use genetic testing . Genetic material store identifier number , letter code . - Parents caregiver ask complete questionnaire examine medical family history well current symptom quality life participant . - Participants may undergo speech language test . This involve answer question , look picture identify item . - Information record participant medical record review collect study .</brief_summary>
