	<brief_summary>investigator first aim determine effect low intensity exercise ( without weight loss ) insulin sensitivity , muscle lipid metabolism , factor regulate process skeletal muscle 1 day , 2 wks , 12 wks training , 3 day without exercise obese adult . investigator second aim determine effect combine low intensity exercise train 10 % weight loss insulin sensitivity , muscle lipid metabolism , factor regulate process skeletal muscle . Although single 40 minute session exercise low exercise intensity improve insulin sensitivity , investigator anticipate adaptation two week exercise training ( 6 session/wk ; 12 session total ) improve insulin sensitivity accompany reduction fatty acid intermediate reduction marker pro-inflammatory activation muscle . investigator anticipate change insulin sensitivity , fatty acid partitioning , pro-inflammatory marker day last session 12 wk train program ( without weight-loss ) similar measure 2 week training . investigator anticipate insulin sensitivity , accumulation fatty acid intermediate , pro-inflammatory activation markedly improve 10 % weight loss measure day exercise . investigator would expect improvement Insulin sensitivity , accumulation fatty acid intermediate , marker inflammatory stress significantly attenuate measured 3 day recent exercise session , beneficial effect 10 % weight loss metabolic endpoint persist compare weight loss .</brief_summary>
