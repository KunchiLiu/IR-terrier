	<brief_summary>Introduction : Patients undergo noncardiac surgery increase risk cardiovascular complication . The development method accurately predict occurrence event critical importance large study publish purpose . Based study , several algorithm propose predict cardiovascular event postoperatively . However , quantification risk often difficult measure , especially patient subclinical disease , always detect routine evaluation . The ankle brachial index ( ABI ) prove valuable tool quantification cardiovascular risk , perhaps promise compare method . It easy , cheap , fast feasible office care , great acceptance patient small intra inter observer variability . Despite strong evidence utility ABI tool assess cardiovascular risk , data use ABI patient refer non vascular surgery , constitute majority operation perform worldwide . Objectives : To evaluate use ABI predictor cardiovascular event patient undergo non-cardiac non-vascular surgery applicability tool reclassification patient risk group establish guideline perioperative evaluation . Methods : 300 moderate high risk patient refer non-vascular non-cardiac include . Data risk factor , sign symptom , physical examination treatment use collect surgery . The ABI measure patient monitor 30 day detection cardiovascular event : death cardiovascular cause , unstable angina , nonfatal myocardial infarction , isolated elevation troponin , decompensated heart failure , cardiogenic shock , stop nonfatal heart failure , pulmonary edema , stroke low limb ischemia . Postoperative electrocardiogram , total creatine kinase , MB fraction troponin I measure daily 3ยบ day whenever clinically indicate .</brief_summary>
