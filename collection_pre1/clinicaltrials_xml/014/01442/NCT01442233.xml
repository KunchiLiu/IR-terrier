	<brief_title>Plasma Exchanges Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Relapses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) relapse usually treated steroid patient respond well treatment . In 40 % MS patient experience relapse , residual disability accumulate spite steroid treatment recover . Plasma exchange ( PE ) frequently use treat severe attack inflammatory demyelination central nervous system resistant steroid ( Tumani , 2008 ) . This strategy evaluate far study . Only one randomize control study perform ( Weinshenker et al , 1999 ) include patient severe attack inflammatory demyelinate disease various origin ( MS , acute transverse myelitis , acute disseminate encephalomyelitis , neuromyelitis optica ) , improve treatment steroid . A moderate important improvement incapacity observe 8 case 19 ( 42.1 % ) treatment PE 1 17 ( 5.9 % ) sham treatment . This study concern 12 patient relapse MS. Based first control study experience treatment 42 MS patient department Neurology University Hospital Pellegrin ( CHU de Bordeaux ) design randomize control study PE sham PE moderate severe acute exacerbation MS respond steroid treatment . The purpose compare plasma exchange versus sham exchange residual disability MS patient demyelinate inflammatory episode ( MS syndrome high risk MS ) experience disable relapse improve steroid treatment . The primary end-point evaluate one month start therapy . Secondary endpoint include safety evaluation improvement 3 6 month evaluation safety</detailed_description>
