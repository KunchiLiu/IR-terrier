	<brief_summary>Exposure ambient level air pollution increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Advanced age among factor associate susceptibility adverse effect air pollution . Dietary fatty acid supplementation show decrease cardiovascular risk multiple mechanism . This study evaluate efficacy supplementation marine fish oil olive oil protect cardiovascular effect induce controlled exposure middle-aged healthy volunteer concentrate ambient air pollution particle . Subjects ( age 50 to72 year ) , randomly assign receive 3 g/d fish oil ( 1.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid 0.82 g docosahexaenoic acid ) , olive oil ( 3g/d ) 28 d. Subjects expose concentrated ambient air pollution particle filter air 2 hr sequential day . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) , plasma lipid , coagulation marker , endothelial function measure flow-mediated dilation brachial artery ( FMD ) assess pre- , immediately post- , 20 hr post-exposure .</brief_summary>
