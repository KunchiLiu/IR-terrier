	<brief_summary>Metformin drug normally use treat people diabetes . New research discover metformin may also kill cancer stem cell . These cancer stem cell make small portion cancer , may responsible resistance chemotherapy cause recurrence cancer . Future study envision test efficacy administer metformin chemotherapy . The purpose study assess safety administer metformin combination chemotherapy . Since chemotherapy cancer cause adverse event , study design run-in stage well subsequent randomization metformin metformin . The primary endpoint compare rate dose-limiting toxicity two arm . After period 3 week primary endpoint comparison , patient receive metformin .</brief_summary>
