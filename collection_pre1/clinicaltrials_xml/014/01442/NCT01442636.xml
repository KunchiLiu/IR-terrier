	<detailed_description>The aim research evaluate immediate long term outcome XIENCE PRIME EverolimusEluting Coronary Stent System prospective investigation treatment patient critical limb ischemia due presence lesion 3cm 10cm length level knee artery . The research question `` Dose use Everolimus coat stent long tibial artery occlusion , 3 10cm offer superior patency 12 month compare historical cohort bare metal stent similar lesion ? '' Our hypothesis use everolimus coat stent tibial artery occlusion 3 10cm result low binary restenosis historically find equivalent non-drugcoated bare metal stent . Currently , evidence angioplasty drug elute stent use therapy patient critical limb ischemia due occlusive infrapopliteal disease . The XIENCE PRIME™ Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( XIENCE PRIME EECSS XIENCE PRIME stent system ) manufacture Abbott . It device/drug combination product consist CobaltChromium MULTILINK VISION 8 Coronary Stent System coat formulation contain everolimus , active ingredient , embed nonerodible polymer . The XIENCE PRIME Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent coat everolimus ( active ingredient ) , embed nonerodible polymer ( inactive ingredient ) . Everolimus active pharmaceutical ingredient XIENCE PRIME stent . It novel semisynthetic macrolide immunosuppressant , synthesized chemical modification rapamycin ( sirolimus ) . The everolimus chemical name 40O ( 2hydroxyethyl ) rapamycin . The XIENCE PRIME stent contains inactive ingredient include poly n-butyl methacrylate ( PBMA ) , polymer adheres stent drug coating , PVDFHFP , comprise vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene monomer drug matrix layer contain everolimus . PBMA homopolymer molecular weight ( Mw ) 264,000 376,000 dalton . PVDFHFP nonerodible semicrystalline random copolymer molecular weight ( Mw ) 254,000 293,000 dalton . The drug matrix copolymer mixed everolimus ( 83 % /17 % w/w polymer/everolimus ratio ) apply entire PBMA coat stent surface . The drug load 100 μg/cm2 product size . No top-coat layer use .</detailed_description>
