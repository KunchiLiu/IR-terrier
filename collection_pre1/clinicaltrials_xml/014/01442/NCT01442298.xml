	<brief_summary>The use bloodless field helpful important method orthopedic surgery . The surgery do without interrupt bleeding , keep exact overlook anatomy . However method without risk , complication various kind may occur . One important factor minimise risk complication , keep low possible cuff pressure . Previous electromyography ( EMG ) study indicate neuromuscular abnormality bloodless field among many patient may lead prolonged rehabilitation period since cause postoperative weakness muscle . Although study unnecessary high tourniquet pressure use EMG test make 6 week 6 month surgery . With today 's demand fast rehabilitation , need good knowledge low tourniquet pressure bloodless field surgery may lead less neuromuscular abnormality . Limb Occlusion Pressure ( LOP ) tourniquet cuff pressure require occlude blood flow . It account patient limb vessel characteristic type fit tourniquet cuff . The method develop simplify , use automatic ( plethysmographic ) sensor place second toe involve limb , administration anaesthesia , immediately limb preparation drape measure limb occlusion pressure . When surgery start , cuff inflate ; plus safety margin base LOP pressure measure . The LOP method still rarely use see difficult time consume . The primary aim study investigate whether reduce use tourniquet pressure new LOP measurement technique still adequate bloodless field ; lead clinical difference regard postoperative pain . The secondary aim investigate difference test group concern muscle function wound heal remain clinical importance . The third aim study common neuromuscular abnormality use bloodless field lower cuff pressure differences standard method LOP method .</brief_summary>
