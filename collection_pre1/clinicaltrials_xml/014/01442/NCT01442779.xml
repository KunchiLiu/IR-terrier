	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Low Dose Oral Interferon Alpha Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study determine oral administration low dos Interferon alpha might effective treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . This disease damage lungs lead mark decrease quality life death within 3-5 year diagnosis . The cause unknown . The standard treatment time steroid prednisone prednisolone anti-inflammatory action , little evidence steroid either improve condition , prevent deterioration improve life expectancy . Additionally , many side effect . In disease , normal cell damage unknown reason replace type scar . This scar tissue prevents easy movement oxygen lung blood , make difficult patient perform normal activity . With progression , usually occur rapidly , patient require supplemental oxygen perform even simple task . Interferons chemical normally produce body rate production show reduced lung patient IPF . They involve regulate activity immune system may play role initiate damage lung IPF also inhibit activity cell form scar tissue . Our hypothesis treat patient interferon might prevent damage additional normal tissue prevent formation additional scar tissue . This would prevent progression , improve quality life extend expect life span successful . Another study ongoing IPF patient give injection large dos another type interferon . This treatment regimen expensive side effect fairly frequent . In contrast , treat IPF patient low dos interferon administer orally . The interferon take three time per day let lozenge dissolve mouth . These low dos show produce effect patient disease produce side effect . If side effect occur , usually severe go away quickly . Those report commonly subject headache , nausea , rash , respiratory infection , sore throat diarrhea . No one stop take medicine side effect . The medicine provide free charge . This study go 5 year . The subject give test receive part standard care . These include chest x-rays , High Resolution CT scan , pulmonary function test blood test . They do start interferon alpha , , depend test , repeat 3- , 6- , 9- 12 month interval . In addition subject ask complete questionnaire quality life , cough history dyspnea index visit .</detailed_description>
