	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent 2 . Males female age 18 year old 3 . History chronic angina define least 2 episode anginal pain discomfort chest , jaw , shoulder , back , neck , arm precipitate exertion emotional stress , relieve rest sublingual nitroglycerin , occur least 2 separate day least 14 day prior PCI ( case stag PCI procedure , least 14 day prior first PCI series ) . Participants may may additional angina episode within 14 day prior first PCI series , well time prior Randomization . 4 . PCI indication ( ACS nonACS ) . For purpose stratification randomization , ACS define hospitalization anginal pain discomfort within previous 24 hour hospitalization one ( ) follow criterion : i. Elevated troponin creatinine kinaseMB ( CKMB ) consistent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , report local laboratory measure prior index PCI ii . Electrocardiographic change ( include transient change ) comprise new presumably new ST segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV ( ≥ 1 mm ) , ST segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV ( ≥ 1 mm ) least 2 contiguous lead , new presumably new Left Bundle Branch Block 5 . Randomization within 14 day postPCI . In case stag PCI procedure , randomization occur within 14 day last PCI series . Participants may randomize start day PCI anytime follow 14 day . PCI define attempt cross lesion wire intention perform revascularization . 6 . PostPCI ( post last PCI stag procedure ) evidence incomplete revascularization define presence one visually estimate ≥ 50 % stenoses one coronary artery reference vessel diameter least 2.0 mm , whether target vessel nontarget vessel regardless presence absence coronary collateral . In case participant postcoronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , incomplete revascularization define presence one visually estimate ≥ 50 % stenosis unbypassed epicardial vessel reference diameter ≥ 2.0 mm , one visually estimate ≥ 50 % stenosis bypass graft supply otherwise unrevascularized myocardial territory . 7 . Clinically stable postPCI . Participants randomized inhospital day plan discharge clinic consider stable . Participants randomize inhospital prior day plan discharge must meet following criterion : i. CKMB &lt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) least 3 hour postPCI , ≥ 3 time ULN evidence decrease CKMB ( decrease least 20 % prior measurement ) report local laboratory . If CKMB available , participant must evidence normal decrease troponin level ( least 20 % prior measurement ) least 3 hour postPCI , report local laboratory . ii . Systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg receive pressor inotropes iii . No current requirement intraaortic balloon pump ( IABP ) leave ventricular assist device iv . No current requirement intravenous ( IV ) nitroglycerin 8 . Ability willingness comply study procedure course study 9 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Screening ( unless surgically sterile postmenopausal ) must agree use highly effective contraception method Screening throughout duration study treatment 14 day follow last dose study drug . 1 . Any future plan revascularization ( include stag procedure ) possible plan revascularization ( ie , plan stress test ass imminent need additional revascularization ) . Future plan stress test purpose monitoring permit strongly discourage . Participants may enrol last PCI stag series decision make perform follow PCI , long Randomization occur within 14 day last PCI . If participant stress test postPCI prior Randomization intervention plan , participant may enrol within 14 day last PCI . 2 . Unrevascularized leave main coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50 % . Participants history CABG leave coronary system consider revascularized leave main least one graft patent . 3 . Major complication index PCI ( case stag PCI , last series ) include : . Major bleeding ( TIMI Bleeding classification bleed require blood transfusion ≥ 2 unit red blood cell ) ii . Coronary perforation require treatment iii . Procedural complication require surgery ( include CABG peripheral vascular surgery ) 4 . Stroke within 90 day prior Randomization , history stroke permanent major neurologic disability ( eg , aphasia significant motor dysfunction ) 5 . Cardiogenic shock within 90 day prior Randomization ( transient decrease blood pressure without clinical sequela consider cardiogenic shock ) 6 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure 7 . Severe renal insufficiency assess estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 use 4 variable modification diet renal disease ( MDRD ) equation per local laboratory ( base last available measurement prior Randomization , collect within 1 month prior index PCI [ case stag PCI , last series ] ) 8 . Liver cirrhosis 9 . Use Class Ia , Ic , Class III antiarrhythmic , except amiodarone 10 . Current treatment strong inhibitor CYP3A 11 . Current treatment CYP3A4 inducer Pgp inducer 12 . Participants take &gt; 20 mg simvastatin daily &gt; 40 mg lovastatin daily reduce dose 20 mg daily simvastatin 40 mg daily lovastatin , switch another statin 13 . Participants take great total 1000 mg daily metformin reduce dose maximum total 1000 mg daily ( additional antidiabetic medication may add clinically indicate allow participant decrease metformin dose maintain glycemic control ) 14 . Previous treatment ranolazine &gt; 7 consecutive day within 30 day prior Randomization , know hypersensitivity intolerance ranolazine excipients 15 . Participation another investigational drug investigational device study within 30 day prior Randomization ( participation registry allow ) 16 . Women pregnant breast feed 17 . Noncoronary artery disease comorbid condition ( eg , advanced malignancy , severe aortic stenosis ) likely result death within 2 year Randomization 18 . Any condition opinion investigator would preclude compliance study protocol</criteria>
