	<brief_summary>Childhood cancer survivor ( CCS ) prone develop obesity increase risk develop cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes compare general pediatric population . Few lifestyle modification trial conduct overweight/obese CCS unclear whether CCS respond similarly lifestyle modification compare overweight/obese individual cancer ( non-CCS ) . We propose 3-year pilot study enroll separate cohort overweight/obese CCS overweight/obese non-CCS every September family-based lifestyle modification program consist weekly session University Minnesota . The goal program facilitate improve physical fitness , weight management , heart health , quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances cancer detection treatment last decade lead marked increase survival rate child adolescent diagnose cancer . As result , number CCS burgeon continue grow . Unfortunately , damage multiple physiological system often occur many effective , yet toxic , cancer therapy use . In particular , radiation chemotherapy think promote environment favorable obesity , atherosclerosis , impair glucose metabolism . More specifically , cardiometabolic risk factor profile CCS characterize abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia , hypertension , impair glucose metabolism/insulin resistance . Excess adiposity adolescence young adulthood , even otherwise healthy individual cancer , associate increase risk CVD T2DM . Moreover , longitudinal data uniformly implicate obesity early life strong predictor future risk factor cluster vascular abnormality later adulthood . Therefore , obesity adolescence young adulthood , even without history cancer , associate greatly increase risk CVD T2DM . The risk likely compound obesity present context cancer survivorship . Lifestyle modification prefer approach reduce risk develop CVD T2DM CCS . However , study conduct area none assess multiple physiological outcome . Furthermore study evaluate response lifestyle modification overweight/obese CCS vs. overweight/obese non-CCS . It possible cancer therapy responsible increase risk CCS ( necessarily behavioral habit ) , CCS may respond less-favorably lifestyle modification compare overweight/obese non-CCS . Therefore , purpose pilot study evaluate effect 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program cardiovascular metabolic health overweight obese child survive childhood cancer type overweight obese child cancer . SPECIFIC AIMS The follow specific aim address pilot study : 1 . Evaluate effect 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program physical fitness overweight/obese child survive childhood cancer overweight/obese child cancer . We hypothesize compare overweight/obese non-CCS child , overweight/obese CCS engage 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program attenuate improvement peak V02 . 2 . Evaluate effect 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program body weight , waist circumference , blood pressure , lipid , artery health , quality life overweight/obese child survive childhood cancer overweight/obese child cancer . We hypothesize compare overweight/obese non-CCS child , overweight/obese CCS engage 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program attenuate improvement body weight , waist circumference , blood pressure , lipid , artery health , quality life .</detailed_description>
