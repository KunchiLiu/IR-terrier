	<brief_summary>Balloon angioplasty ( Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) ) commonly use treat patient obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Although PCI highly effective management CAD , potentiate exist prothrombotic state around lesion area . A certain level anticoagulation require perform plan PCI safely minimize periprocedural risk thrombosis attendant complication , include myocardial ischemia infarction ( heart attack ) . Many different anti-thrombotic regimen investigate currently use . The aim study explore whether Rivaroxaban , compare unfractionated heparin , background standard dual antiplatelet therapy , effectively suppress thrombosis related adverse ischemic event , upon balloon inflation stent expansion , elective PCI , without increase bleeding . The treatment assignment do semi-blinded design , eg , blind randomization either Rivaroxaban ( one three arm ) control ( UFH ) group . However , blind treatment dose rivaroxaban ( either 10mg 20 mg ) .The 10 mg rivaroxaban plus 50 IU UFH arm blind .</brief_summary>
