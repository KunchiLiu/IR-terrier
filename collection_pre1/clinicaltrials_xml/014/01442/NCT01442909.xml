	<brief_summary>Both pemetrexed docetaxel report similar activity non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) fail previous chemotherapy large randomized phase III study . However , study show different toxicity efficacy profile within individual patient . Present phase II randomize clinical trial design answer question , addition information whether sequential therapy prolong disease-free overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Docetaxel first third-generation anti-cancer drug find activity second-line chemotherapy NSCLC , prolongation patient survival phase III randomize trial compare docetaxel vinorelbine ifosfamide , best supportive care , NSCLC patient fail previous chemotherapy ; thus , recommend second-line treatment NSCLC . Four year trial , pemetrexed show similar activity less toxicity , compare docetaxel treatment phase III randomize trial NSCLC patient previously treat chemotherapy . Pemetrexed multitargeted antifolate exhibit clinical activity variety solid tumor , especially malignant mesothelioma NSCLC . It inhibit thymidylate synthase , dihydrofolate reductase glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase . Pemetrexed confirm activity previously chemotherapy-treated NSCLC good toxicity profile docetaxel , study docetaxel dosage use 75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion ( IV ) every 3 week . However , docetaxel dosage use Japan Taiwan usually 60 mg/m2 every 3 week . Whether toxicity profile two different drug individual patient similar finding patient receive specific drug unknown , unknown toxicity profile docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 3 week compare alimta 500 mg/m2 every 3 week . Present phase II randomize clinical trial design answer question , addition information whether sequential therapy prolong disease-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
