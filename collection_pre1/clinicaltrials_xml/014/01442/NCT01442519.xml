	<brief_summary>Intravesical treatment superficial bladder cancer use past 4-5 decade . Intravesical chemotherapy beneficial term recurrence time recurrence grade 1-2 stage Ta tumour , usually non-invasive . Intravesical chemotherapy negligible effect disease progression high-risk superficial bladder cancer—ie , grade 3 , stage T1 , carcinoma situ . However , BCG induction maintenance treatment effectively delay progression . Electromotive mitomycin increase tissue uptake compare passive diffusion . Electromotive mitomycin emerge alternative complementary treatment BCG . The rationale combining anticancer drug base need increase efficacy reduce emergence resistant malignant cell . This approach frequently apply use intravesical agent treatment superficial bladder cancer , immunotherapeutic BCG chemotherapeutic mitomycin seem potentially effective combination . Studies address concurrent use mitomycin BCG , assign two role mitomycin : antitumor action tissue-scarifying ( ie , surface-modifying ) effect enable BCG attach efficiently urothelium . The investigator therefore aim assess whether induction inflammation use BCG mitomycin treatment make bladder mucosa permeable thus enable mitomycin reach target easily . This randomised trial compare efficacy sequential BCG electromotive mitomycin current standard BCG alone patient high-risk superficial bladder cancer . After transurethral resection multiple biopsy patient stage pT1 bladder cancer randomly assign : 81 mg BCG infuse 120 min week 6 week ; 81 mg BCG infuse 120 min week 2 week , follow 40 mg electromotive mitomycin ( intravesical electric current 20 mA 30 min ) week one cycle three cycle ( n=107 ) . Complete responder underwent maintenance treatment : assign BCG alone one infusion 81 mg BCG month 10 month , assign BCG mitomycin 40 mg electromotive mitomycin month 2 month , follow 81 mg BCG month one cycle three cycle . The primary endpoint disease-free interval ; secondary endpoint time progression ; overall survival ; disease-specific survival . Analyses intention treat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient histologically proven stage pT1 urothelial carcinoma bladder , whether papillary solid , regard high risk tumour recurrence moderate high risk progression : multifocal pT1 , primary recurrent , grade 2 transitional-cell carcinoma ; primary recurrent pT1 , multifocal solitary , grade 3 transitional-cell carcinoma ; pT1 carcinoma situ . Inclusion criterion : age 18 year old ; adequate bone-marrow reserve ; normal renal function ; normal liver function ; Karnofsky performance status 50 100 . Exclusion criterion : previous treatment BCG electromotive mitomycin ; treatment intravesical cytostatic agent within past 6 month ; concomitant urothelial tumour upper urinary tract ; previous muscle-invasive ( ie , stage T2 high ) transitional-cell carcinoma bladder ; bladder capacity le 2 L ; untreated urinary-tract infection ; severe systemic infection ( ie , sepsis ) ; urethral stricture would prevent endoscopic procedure repeat catheterisation ; disease upper urinary tract ( eg , vesicoureteral reflux urinary-tract stone ) would make multiple transurethral procedure risk ; previous radiotherapy pelvis ; concurrent chemotherapy ; treatment radiotherapy-response biological-response modifier ; history tuberculosis ; malignant disease within 5 year trial registration ( except basal-cell carcinoma ) ; pregnancy nursing ; psychological , familial , sociological , geographical factor would preclude study participation . Study design The institutional review board every participate centre approve study design . Every patient enrol sign informed-consent form approve institutional review board . All patient underwent : urinary cytology bladder upper urinary tract ; random cold-cup biopsy bladder prostatic urethra—ie , sample seemingly healthy urothelium suspicious area ; complete transurethral resection bladder tumour visible endoscopy , ensure muscle include resected sample . Patients positive suspect cytology , carcinoma situ , multifocal tumour , grade 3 tumour underwent restaging transurethral resection 4-5 week later . All clinical assessor adequately trained procedure , method use enhance quality measurement . All biopsy sample tumour bladder review pathologist stage grade . Tumour stage classify accord 1997 TNM classification International Union Against Cancer , tumour grade define accordance 1973 WHO classification . Patients randomise within 10 day first restaging transurethral resection . Randomisation data collection do use central computer . Patients allocate BCG alone BCG electromotive mitomycin use stratify , block randomisation cross 14 stratum result four factor : primary versus recurrent tumour ; multifocal versus unifocal tumour ; grade 3 versus grade 2 tumour ; presence versus absence carcinoma situ . MV generate coordinated randomisation process . This study blind difference treatment schedule drug appearance . Treatment schedule All patient schedule receive allocate intervention 3 week transurethral resection multiple , random biopsy sampling . The BCG instillation consist 81 mg wet weight BCG Connaught substrain ( ImmuCyst® , Alfa Wassermann SpA , Bologna , Italy ) . Lyophilised ( ie , freeze-dried ) BCG suspend 50 mL bacteriostatic-free solution 0·9 % sodium chloride . After drain bladder , suspension infuse intravesically Foley catheter . The solution retain bladder 120 min , follow empty bladder removal catheter . Patients randomly allocate BCG mitomycin , place fluid restriction 2 g ingest sodium bicarbonate night treatment , morning treatment , 2 h treatment mitomycin . A Foley catheter insert postvoid residual volume reduce less 10mL . 40 mg mitomycin ( Mitomycin , Kyowa Italiana Farmaceutici , Srl , Milan , Italy ) dissolve 100 mL water infuse intravesically Foley catheter gravity retain bladder 30 min , 40-60 mA per maximum 20 mA 30 min pulse electric current give externally.13 Two dispersive cathode electrode place low abdominal skin degrease alcohol 2-5-mm layer conductive gel apply . The bladder empty catheter remove . The BCG-alone group assign one course intravesical treatment per week 6 week ; patient assign sequential BCG electromotive mitomycin assign one course treatment per week 9 week , one cycle consist two BCG infusion one mitomycin infusion ( three cycle total ) . Patients BCG-alone group disease-free 3 month treatment schedule receive monthly infusion BCG 10 month . Patients BCG-and-mitomycin group disease-free 3 month treatment schedule receive one infusion month 9 month : three cycle mitomycin , mitomycin , BCG ( ie , six infusion mitomycin three infusion BCG . Maintenance treatment group give dose method infusion initial allocate treatment .
