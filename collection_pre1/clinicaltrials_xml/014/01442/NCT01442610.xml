	<detailed_description>Sleeping disorder common patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . Mainly initiation maintenance sleep disturbed , therefore many patient suffer daytime sleepiness sleep attack . Polysomnographic study show increased sleep fragmentation frequent awakening , increase amount wakefulness time bed well reduced sleep efficacy deep sleep time . In addition , increase sleep latency , REM-latency decrease amount REM sleep document . PD patient also suffer primary sleep disorder like sleep disorder breathe especially REM sleep behaviour disorder ( RBD ) periodic limb movement sleep ( PLMS ) . Not neurochemical change affect cholinergic monoaminergic system , nocturnal hypokinesia rigidity painful dystonia due disease , also medication side effect lead impaired sleep-wake-control reduce REM sleep . Although levodopa medication dopamine agonists reduce nocturnal hypokinesia therefore improve insomnia also potential impact daytime sleepiness able cause sleep disruption . The impact dopaminergic therapy complex show biphasic effect increase wakefulness decrease REM-sleep frequency via stimulation dopamine D1 receptor whereas low dos promote sleep via dopamine D2 receptor . In addition , act dopamine agonist via dopamine D3 receptor might responsible daytime sleepiness sleep attack . However , stimulation subthalamic nucleus improves mainly motor skill also show important increase sleep duration quality , could suggest decrease nocturnal hypokinesia improvement sleep quality achieve . Rasagiline mesylate develop selective irreversible MAO-B- inhibitor - unlike Selegiline - metabolize amphetamine derivates find partly responsible negative effect RBD REM-sleep well sleep efficacy . Rasagiline able delay need initiate dopaminergic therapy , improve motor function early moderate advance PD show exhibit neuroprotective potential . As different mechanism dopaminergic medication different dopamine receptor still fully elucidate contrast selegiline side effect due development amphetamine derivates need take consideration , study aim evaluate effect sleep daytime sleepiness treatment Rasagiline mesylate . As Rasagiline able improve motor skill might positive effect sleep disruption reduce nocturnal akinesia . As report cause less sleep disruption PD Patients placebo might able improve sleep architecture . Until clinical trial use polysomnographic technique perform evaluate effect Rasagiline sleep . To study effect Rasagiline sleep disturbance measure polysomnographic ( PSG ) evaluation sleep efficacy PDSS-2 . Secondary measure sleep variable measure PSG . In addition , sleep quality daytime sleepiness assess standardized scale well cognitive function , depression index QoL index measure .</detailed_description>
