	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES To identify combine set predictor ( i.e . statistical modeling , machine learn classifier neural network ) predict progression glaucoma patient To determine sensitively specifically determine progression trial potential neuroprotective agent . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To evaluate genetic potential biomarkers associate progression glaucoma . To evaluate test currently use glaucoma patient well predict one sensitive detect disease progression measure rate change . To assess progression structural functional test : - Optic disc stereophotographs - Cirrus OCT - RTVue OCT - Standard Automated Perimetry ( SAP ) - Frequency Doubling Technology Matrix</detailed_description>
