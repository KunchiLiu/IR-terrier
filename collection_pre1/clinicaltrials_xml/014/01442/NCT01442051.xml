	<brief_summary>The purpose study help u learn low risk blood transfusion surgery remove ovarian cancer . Acute normovolemic hemodilution ( ANH ) technique perform operating room procedure begin may reduce risk need transfusion ovarian cancer surgery . During surgery , patient 's blood give back need , usually due bleeding . If n't need blood surgery , blood give back end case . The idea behind ANH remove blood replace fluid , remain blood becomes dilute . This dilute blood lose surgery , usually due bleeding . The original non-diluted blood transfuse back need . This may mean low chance need additional blood transfusion . ANH study hospital type cancer . These study suggest ANH may help conserve blood . Although study suggest ANH perform safely , one study show ANH could associate high rate serious bowel complication standard treatment . In study , patient underwent ANH high rate anastomotic leak bowel surgery . An anastomotic leak occur two end bowel cut sewn back together ( anastomosis ) , fall apart . The investigator n't know whether ANH result high rate anastomotic leak patient ovarian cancer surgery . In fact , another study evaluate ANH patient kind bowel resection often occur ovarian cancer surgery ( colon ) , increase risk anastomotic leak observe . For reason , researcher MSKCC conduct study find ANH use safely patient undergo surgery ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
