	<brief_summary>The cardiac variant Fabry disease rare cardiomyopathy affect 1/50000 individual general population . It generally diagnose advanced stage disease , present clinical feature similar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy one , make difficult correct diagnosis . In Fabry disease remodel process myocardial interstitium apoptosis myocytes lead fibrosis development later systolic dysfunction . The investigator propose evaluate utility several biomarkers diagnosis cardiomyopathy , facilitate early diagnosis , clue establish early enzyme replacement therapy intensify patient ' follow . In order achieve objective , investigator analyze marker endothelial dysfunction , fibrosis apoptosis peripheral blood sample patient carry mutation without clinical manifestation investigator compare level dose obtain two different control group : diagnose patient present clinical manifestation index case healthy control without carry mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myocardial Affectation Patients With Fabry Disease Without Phenotypic Manifestation . Diagnostic Value Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fabry disease X-linked recessive disease , affect lysosomal storage variable phenotype characterize accumulation glycosphingolipids several tissue . It describe 200 mutation alfa-galactosidase A ( GLA ) gene cause Fabry disease . Nowadays , treatment Fabry disease consist enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) development show reversal abnormal accumulation glycosphingolipids different tissue clinical improvement stabilization ( 1 ) . Unlike classic systemic Fabry disease multiple organ affectation , cardiac variant disease characterize myocardial hypertrophy . Hence , cardiac Fabry variant define storage myocyte disorder mimic clinical feature hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) ( 2 ) . The gold standard diagnosis Fabry disease electron microscopy evaluation cardiac sample obtain endomyocardial biopsy ( 2 ) , although publish determination alfa-galactosidase activity plasma patient diagnose Fabry disease , follow sequence GLA gene individual low activity level good non-invasive diagnostic method allow identification disease carrier early start enzymatic replacement therapy ( 3 ) . Due similarity clinical characteristic disease extraordinary low incidence Fabry disease , biopsy execution rarely carry diagnosis . Hence , speculate high disease incidence exist hide among patient present clinical symptom HCM . Several study evaluate incidence Fabry disease among patient diagnose HCM , find even 8-10 % patient actually present Fabry disease ( 4,5 ) , although bias patient selection exist . In recent study include one carry group higher number patient , low incidence ( 1-3 % ) find ( 3,6 ) . So , Fabry rare disease affect 1/50000 individual population ( 3 ) . Extracellular matrix dynamic structure intense participation myocardial remodel occurs different cardiovascular disease ( 7 ) . Alterations extracellular matrix could perform important role diastolic dysfunction process link myocardial hypertrophy . Collagen deposit increase leave ventricular chamber stiffness ventricular load diastole compromise . Collagen turnover increase compare healthy control , synthesis predominant degradation , find associate change metalloproteinase activity ( MMP , principal enzyme charge matrix degradation ) inhibitor ( TIMP ) ( 8 ) . Our group recently publish several paper relevance fibrosis patient MCH ( 9,10,11,12 ) . The investigator find fibrosis , assess late Gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance , related ventricular remodeling , hypertrophy , ventricular tachycardia ( 10 ) functional state patient ( 11 ) MMP-9 value independently associate fibrosis ( 9 ) . There also study describe structural change matrix associate Fabry disease , fibrosis presence evident interstitial level replace myocardiocytes loss ( 13 ) . However , yet demonstrate whether alteration interstitial matrix take place due fibroblast activation response humoral mechanical factor without myocardiocytes loss , contrary , associated cellular death . The interest apoptosis , program cell death , increase heart failure . Apoptosis activate interaction cell surface death receptor ( i.e . receptor tumoral necrosis factor superfamily -TNFR- Fas protein receptor ) , ligands ( TNF-alfa Fas ligand , FasL ) ( 14 ) , activation mitochondrial pro-apoptotic mechanism , response unfavorable change intracellular environment ( 15 ) . The subsequent development regulate Bcl-2 protein group ( 16 ) execute caspase family ( 17 ) . During apoptosis , Annexin 5 , produce myocytes secrete interstitial space ( 18,19 ) . Annexin 5 seem contribute intracellular calcium management alteration , lead systolic dysfunction ( 20 , 21 ) . Myocardiocytes death via apoptosis could common process previously think , estimation repair process contribute interstitium expansion . GDF-15 member TGF-Î² superfamily , well establish marker risk prognosis acute coronary syndrome . It recently propose regulator fibrosis tissue remodel process probably prevention apoptosis ( 22 ) . Apoptosis myocardiocytes lead progressive ventricular wall slimming , previously report MCH ( 23 ) , systolic dysfunction . Many molecule involve apoptosis ventricular remodel detected peripheral blood know biomarkers . Biomarkers give information normal biological process physiopathologic mechanism useful differential diagnosis even prognosis . Nowadays , raise interest study utility biomarkers cardiovascular disease , use ischemic cardiopathy heart failure ( 24-27 ) . Unfortunately study HCM less develop , even less Fabry disease . Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) study biomarker HCM relate presence heart failure symptom ( 28-30 ) , poor functional capacity ( 30 ) leave ventricular outflow obstruction ( 31-34 ) . On hand ST2 start recently consider good biomarker myocardial-specific response stretch , synergistic implication prognosis BNP ( 35 ) . Our group currently develop project study several biomarkers ( myocardial stress , endothelial damage , hypercoagulable state ) order explore different system involve ventricular remodel HCM ( assess echocardiography cardiac magnetic resonance ) could similar Fabry disease . In Fabry disease , plasma urine level globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) use biomarker . This glycosphingolipid store lysosome Fabry patient , although show detected plasma urine concentration vary , due different mutation provoke complete loss alfa-galactosidase activity . In addition , heterozygous woman plasma level normal data suggest high concentration urine ( 36 ) . On hand , suggest lactosylceramide , catabolic product Gb3 , regulate expression pattern TNF-alfa ICAM-1 , contribute atherosclerosis development ( 37 ) . The investigator dispose specialize cardiomyopathy clinic three hospital : Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca , Murcia , Hospital General Universitario de Alicante , Hospital General Universitario de Elche . The investigator already recruit 12 family diagnose Fabry probands total 60 relative clinically check within last 4 month . The investigator consider recruitment patient successful ready carry present project . However , investigator would like participate centre order share patient mutate relative without phenotypic disease expression . The aim present project study biomarkers apoptosis , fibrosis interstitial remodel peripheral sample patient diagnose Fabry disease relative . Our objective establish whether exists myocardial affectation data mutation carrier without phenotypic disease criterion . The investigator also focus different polymorphism implication development Fabry disease .</detailed_description>
