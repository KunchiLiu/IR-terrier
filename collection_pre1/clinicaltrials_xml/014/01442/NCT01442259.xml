Female subject must nonchild bear potential define postmenopausal females regular menstrual bleeding least 1 year prior inclusion Body weight : ≥50kg ; BMI : 1834 kg/m2 Ability communicate well investigator comply requirement study . For subject renal impairment No current clinically significant disease ( renal impairment ) , except stable underlying disease cause renal impairment , determine clinical history physical examination . MDRDcalculated eGFR &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 base serum creatinine Vital sign ( 3 minute rest measure supine position ) within normal range deem Investigator . For healthy subject No current clinically significant disease determine clinical history physical examination . MDRDcalculated eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 base serum creatinine . Vital sign ( 3 minute rest measure supine position ) within normal range deem Investigator . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) female Use prescription overthecounter ( OTC ) drug , herbal ( e.g . St. John 's wort ) ordietary supplement ( e.g . broccoli , vitamin ) within three week five half life ( whichever longer ) prior dose AFQ056 study completion . This include drug use ( symptomatic ) treatment renal impairment ( e.g . antihypertensive antidiabetic drug ) provide drug : use dose within three week five half life ( whichever longer ) prior dose AFQ056 study completion . know inhibitor inducer CYP1A1 , 1A2 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 , 3A5 gp ) . Participation clinical investigation use investigational drug within 30 day five ( 5 ) halflives give investigational drug ( whichever period longer ) ; longer require local regulation prior screen study completion Donation loss 400 mL blood within 8 week prior first dose , longer required local regulation . History renal transplantation History presence prolong QTc interval ( male : &gt; 450ms ; female : &gt; 470 m ) , 2nd 3rd degree AVblock clinically significant ECG abnormality determine medical history 12lead ECG recording screen baseline 1 . History presence clinically significant disease major system organ class , within past 2 year prior screen , except renal impairment underlie disease cause renal impairment subject belong renal impairment group . Subjects undergo method dialysis ( hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis ) History ongoing active substance abuse ( include alcohol ) within past 2 year . Smokers ( use tobacco product previous 3 month ) . Urine cotinine level measure Screening Baseline subject . Smokers define subject report tobacco use and/or urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL screen Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
