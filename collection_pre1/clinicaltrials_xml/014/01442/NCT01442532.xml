	<detailed_description>Participants assign either Part 1 Part 2 study . Part 1 single-center , double-blind ( participant study personnel know identity treatment ) , randomize ( treatment assign chance ) , single- multiple-dose study . There 3 group Part 1 , dose follow : Group A receive single oral dose 30 mg JNJ-38518168 ( give three 10-mg tablet JNJ-38518168 ) placebo ( treatment identical appearance JNJ-38518168 contain active drug ) ( Period 1 ) , multiple oral dos 30 mg JNJ 38518168 ( give three 10-mg tablet JNJ-38518168 ) match placebo daily 14 consecutive day ( Period 2 ) ; Group B receive single oral dose 10 mg JNJ-38518168 placebo ( Period 1 ) , multiple oral dos 10 mg JNJ-38518168 placebo daily 14 consecutive day ( Period 2 ) ; Group C receive single oral dose 3 mg JNJ-38518168 placebo ( Period 1 ) , multiple oral dos 3 mg JNJ-38518168 placebo daily 14 consecutive day ( Period 2 ) . At least 20-day washout period separate dose administration Period 1 first dose administration Period 2 . The duration Part 1 approximately 78 day . Part 2 study single-center , open-label ( participant study personnel know identity treatment ) , non-randomized , multiple dose , drug-drug interaction study . Eligible participant receive single oral dose 2.5 mg midazolam oral solution Day 1 , three 10-mg tablet JNJ-38518168 ( 30 mg ) daily 14 consecutive day ( Day 2 Day 15 ) ; another single oral dose 2.5 mg midazolam Day 15 . The duration Part 2 study approximately 42 day . Following interim safety PK data analysis , one additional treatment group may study evaluate effect JNJ-38518168 dose lower 30 mg daily PK midazolam . During Parts 1 2 , participant may admit clinical unit period 7 18 day , follow-up return visit clinic also require .</detailed_description>
