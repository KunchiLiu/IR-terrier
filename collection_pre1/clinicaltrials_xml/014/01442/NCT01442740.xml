	<detailed_description>Our objective determine whether 15-degree RTP FESS influence intra-operative blood loss surgical field score compare patient supine position . Our hypothesis 15-degree RTP position inferior supine position reduce intra-operative blood loss improve surgical field view FESS . Specific Aims Aim 1 : To determine effect 15-degree RTP total blood loss , time surgery endoscopic surgical view , compare patient supine position , FESS . Participants sinus cavity assess rigid endoscopy surgery . The Boezaart scaling system use primary endoscopic surgical field measure . Total Blood Loss ( TBL ) , Mean Arterial Pressure ( MAP ) , pulse rate Time Surgery ( TOS ) record intra-operatively anesthesiologist support nurse staff . The result experiment determine whether utilize 15-degree RTP effective reduce blood loss ESS . Background significance : Chronic Rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) associate nasal obstruction , discolor nasal discharge , facial congestion pressure last least twelve week ( 1,2 ) . Nasal polyposis may also present CRS ( 1,2 ) . Corticosteroids medicate nasal irrigation recommend preliminary treatment options3 . Sinus surgery recommend patient whose symptom refractory maximal medical management . FESS evolve become preferred surgical method treat CRS sinus relate diseases4 . When compare previous open craniofacial approach , technique find less invasive , low-risk reduces operate time improve post-operative outcomes4 . FESS perform supine position standard St. Paul 's Sinus Centre . Surgeon experience indicate patient 0-degree operate position , allow consistent orientation sinus anatomy . However , bleed within surgical area obscure endoscopic field view , increase risk surgical complication may include cerebrospinal fluid leak , hemorrhage , infection damage optic nerve internal carotid artery ( 4,6 ) . There several factor available control hypotension surgery use total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , pre-operative topical treatment steroid , local vasoconstrictor patient position4 . TIVA observe reduce intra-operative hemorrhage lower mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) compare inhalational anesthesia ESS5 . The use corticosteroid prior surgery find reduce peri-operative blood loss ( 6 ) . Results indicate TIVA pre-operative steroid treatment significantly low surgical grade score improve endoscopic visualization ( 5,6 ) . However , alter patient position operation may provide simple option reduce presence blood within surgical field . The Reverse Trendelenburg Position ( RTP ) head-up , feet-down tilt vary 10 30 degree ( 7 ) . When use surgery , RTP find reduce hydrostatic force venous congestion ( 6,7 ) . In morbidly obese patient anesthesia alter respiratory function RTP identify safe intra-operative procedure , improve oxygenation minimal MAP change ( 9 ) . This position find reduce intra-cranial pressure craniotomy thereby , decrease surgical risk cerebral swell herniation ( 8 ) . The role RTP factor relate intra-operative blood loss FESS recently examine . Ko et al . ( 2008 ) equally randomize 60 CRS patient receive FESS 10-degree RTP complete supine position . Patients CRS without nasal polyposis , mild moderate hypertension , diabetes , chronic renal disease , uncritical medical condition include study ( 10 ) . Patients exclude severe uncontrolled case hypertension , cardiovascular disease preoperative use anticoagulant medication ( 10 ) . All patient receive combination intravenous inhaled anesthesia . This induced fentanyl , xylocaine , propofol cisatracurim . Desflurane sevoflurane use intra-operatively maintain anesthesia ( 10 ) . In addition , 1 % solution lidocaine hydrochloride , local anesthetic , adrenaline dilution 1:80,000 injected surgical field pterygopalatine fossa . Total blood loss ( TBL ) measure suction bottle surgery OR nurse . Blood loss per minute ( BL/Min ) calculate divide TBL total time surgery . The Boezaart grading system use evaluate effect bleed within surgical field ( SF ) . The inverse trendelenburg position find significantly reduce TBL ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , BL/Min ( P &lt; 0.001 ) SF score ( P &lt; 0.004 ) . Due highly vascularized nature paranasal sinus , small amount blood cause substantial impairment endoscopic view . The RTP reduce venous return cardiac output retain blood low part body ( 10,11 ) . As result , reduce intraoperative blood loss report previous study employ operate position surgery ( 10,11,12 ) . Although RTP utilized Otorhinolaryngology , previously mention study use combination total intravenous inhale anesthesia study subject ( 10 ) . Previous literature show TIVA reduce intra-operative blood loss compare inhaled anesthesia5 . We aim evaluate 15-degree RTP patient receive TIVA preoperative steroid treatment reduce endoscopic visual impairment . Experimental Design Methods : Research Method : Randomized unblinded , prospective study Recruitment CRS patient Patients require endoscopic sinus surgery approach partake study . These patient individual fail conventional medical therapy require expertise tertiary rhinologist treat sinus disease . This tertiary base rhinology centre average 6000 outpatient visit &gt; 400 FESS case year . This busy rhinology centre Western Canada . The site coordinator one Principal Investigator 's designates describe study design patient . Patients one month prior surgery sign consent form plan partake study . Patients place study provide direct line St. Paul 's Sinus Centre therefore talk co-investigators question concern . Inclusion Criteria : - Patients 19 year age old - Patients undergo primary revision functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) - Patients CRS without polyposis Exclusion Criteria : - Patients age 19 - Patients history coagulation disorder - Patients severe uncontrolled case hypertension cardiovascular disease - Patients undergo sinonasal tumor resection Experimental Control Arm All patient treat one-week course prednisone 20mg day oral antibiotic ( clavulin clindamycin penicillin allergic ) prior surgical intervention . Patients randomized experimental ( 15-degree RTP ) control ( supine ) arm base close envelope system . Procedure Pre-Operative : - Obtain informed consent 64 patient prior surgery - Randomize patient experimental ( 15-degree RTP ) arm control ( supine position ) arm . - 32 patient receive FESS 15-degree RTP position - 32 patient receive FESS standard supine ( 0-degree ) position - Pre-existing health condition , current medication patient demographic ( age , sex ) record - Patients instructed take standard pre-operative medication use St. Paul 's Hospital ( prednisone antibiotic 1 week ) . Intra-operative : - Patients initially place 0-degree supine position , blood pressure pulse rate record . - All patient undergo total intravenous anesthesia , prescribe infusion administer reside anesthetist . Anesthesia infusion document record . - The Principal Investigator one designate electronically calibrate operate table bring patient experimental arm study 15-degree RTP . Those control arm remain supine position . - Primary Outcome Measures : - MAP , pulse rate endoscopic field view record every 15 minute intra-operatively . - Once procedure complete , total time surgery total estimate blood loss record . - Blood loss per minute calculate use total blood loss divide total operating time . Aim 1 : To determine effect 15-degree RTP total blood loss , time surgery endoscopic surgical field view compare patient supine position , FESS . Primary outcome measure document periodic interval intra-operatively completion surgery . The Principal Investigator one designate record MAP , pulse rate endoscopic surgical field score every 15 minute start surgery . Documentation MAP , pulse rate , endoscopic surgical field score periodic interval standard practice surgery do study patient case . Once procedure complete , total blood loss time surgery record . The total amount blood lose calculated suction bottle measure milliliter surgery . This confirm circulate nurse anesthetist . Total time surgery record minute , circulate nurse anesthetist . In certain circumstance operation may extend due unexpected complication , therefore total blood loss may increase due prolong surgery . To determine blood loss per minute ( mL/min ) , total estimate blood loss divide time surgery . Ko et al ( 2008 ) previously calculate blood loss per minute formula analysis role RTP endoscopic sinus surgery . The Boezaart intra-operative surgical field scale use grade level bleeding surgery . This 0 5-point scale use outline amount suction require rid area blood disrupt vision . A score 0 give area bleeding , 1 slight bleed suction require , 2 slight bleed require suction , 3 moderate bleed improves several second suction occur , 4 moderate bleeding restarts directly suction 5 severe bleeding occur faster remove ( 12 ) . Data Collection Statistical Analysis Discussion statistician indicate base previous study10 , population size 64 patient would need achieve power rating 80 % . Both experimental control arm 32 patient enrol . To determine sample size , confidence interval 95 % utilized create responsive range double standard deviation . In consideration location vascularity paranasal sinus , Boezaart score 3 expect surgery . Clinically significant change intra-operative bleeding define change Boezaart score 20 % , one point relation scale . All data collect study gather password protect Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file . Each patient assign unique identification allow patient data record . The Microsoft Excel database include : - Age - Sex - Pre-existing health condition - Current medication - Lund-Kennedy CT score - CRS without polyposis - Primary revision surgery - Anesthesia infusion - Surgical position ( 15-degree RTP Supine ) - MAP ( 15 minute interval ) - Pulse rate ( 15 minute interval ) - Endoscopic surgical field score ( 15 minute interval ) - Intra-operative complication - Microdebrider usage - Total blood loss - Total time surgery Risks No adverse risk expect place patient experimental 15-degree reverse trendelenburg position . Patient care compromise time surgery . Patients able withdraw study stage without affect quality medical care receive . Difficulties Limitations Aim 1 : No difficulty expect . Standard practice FESS St. Paul 's Sinus Centre document total time surgery blood loss anesthetist nurse progress note , post-operative surgical report . For best result , include periodic measurement MAP , pulse rate endoscopic surgical field view 15-minute interval intra-operatively . Unexpected sudden adverse event surgery may hinder periodic assessment primary outcome measure , priority give patient safety .</detailed_description>
