	<brief_summary>This study evaluate novel micrografting technique see influence heal rate cosmetic result second intention wound . The graft harvest micrografting process design MoMelan Technologies The Epidermal Expansion System , compose commercially available Blister Generation Device Microblister Generation Excision Device ( MBGED ) , generate array small microblisters transfer micrografts sterile dress ( Tegadermâ„¢ - FDA approve wound dress ) application subject 's surgical area . The investigator predict apply expand micrografts wound otherwise would heal second intention alone hasten heal possible reduce scarring .</brief_summary>
