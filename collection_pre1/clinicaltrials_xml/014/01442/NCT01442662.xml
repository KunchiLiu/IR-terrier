	<brief_title>Efficacy Gemcitabine With Pazopanib Second Line Treatment Patients With Metastatic Relapsed Uterine Soft Tissue Leiomyosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To determine PFS use combination gemcitabine pazopanib patient metastasis relapse leiomyosarcoma ( uterine soft tissue ) already receive first line anthracycline base therapy . Secondary objective : To determine disease control rate To determine response rate To determine toxicity associate combined gemcitabine pazopanib To determine correlation metabolic response PFS Design : All eligible patient enter study receive daily oral pazopanib 800mg , supply 200 mg aqueous film-coated tablet 2 intravenous gemcitabine every three week ( 8 cycle max ) . The treatment continue development unacceptable toxicity evidence disease progression patient 's / investigator 's decision withdrawal .</detailed_description>
