	<brief_summary>The axillary region regularly use brachial plexus block . The technique may guide nerve stimulation , ultrasound combination nerve stimulation ultrasound . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) beneficial present anatomy interest regional anesthesia demonstrate spread local anesthetic ( LA ) . An axillary MRI-study department support suggestion multiple rather single injection technique . Using 0.5 Tesla open MR scanner study , investigator able distinguish terminal nerve equally sized vessel . Therefore investigator could definitely answer whether LA reach pertinent nerve . The investigator recently perform axillary block study 3.0 Tesla scanner . Now terminal nerve identify patient investigator could observe LA reached nerve . The aim study demonstrate anatomy brachial plexus axillary region different level . The investigator present best picture nerve without LA inject . The image demonstrate axial coronal plane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Axillary Region High Resolution MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For upper limb surgery , brachial plexus block interscalene , supraclavicular , infraclavicular axillary level alternative general anesthesia . The axillary block require deposit achieve complete block . MRI investigation interest well understand block specific distribution LA . With new MRI Achieva 3.0T X-series ( Philips Electronics , Eindhoven Netherlands ) , resolution beyond 100Î¼m use 2k imaging , expect new information also compare early axillary MRI publication department . In former study use single deposit technique open 0.5 Tesla scanner . We could study recognize terminal nerve determine LA reach axillary plexus . MRI publication brachial plexus mostly study shoulder region describe axillary region . We find article describe axillary brachial plexus use 3.0 Tesla high resolution MRI . Ultrasound visualize plexus nerve axilla demonstrate dynamically spread LA . This usually occur 2-dimensional image initially observe LA fade minute . MRI provide easy 3 - dimensional image also oblique plane compare ultrasound . This study do order demonstrate relevant anatomy volunteer spread LA patient . We also present used protocol MRI - stack optimize configuration 3.0 MRI scanner .</detailed_description>
