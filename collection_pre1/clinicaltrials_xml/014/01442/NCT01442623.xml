	<brief_summary>Dizziness common disable symptom associate unsteadiness stand walking , sometimes result fall . People problem often disease process affect inner ear . A proportion people recover spontaneously time ; may benefit specialized form physiotherapy know vestibular rehabilitation . This consist exercise regime individualize person depend problem . These regime aim decrease dizziness , help patient re-learn movement pattern improve balance stand walk . There considerable research support vestibular rehabilitation clear best type , set frequency treatment . How therapy impact walk ability also clear . Recent development suggest force plate virtual reality therapy may benefit . This form therapy provide feedback unavailable conventional exercise . Exposure virtual environment challenge balance help retrain . The aim study compare conventional vestibular rehabilitation force plate/virtual reality therapy base vestibular rehabilitation , use universally available virtual reality system ( Nintendo Wii Fit Plus速 ) . In study , consent patient vestibular disorder assign randomly either conventional treatment virtual reality base treatment customized individual problem . They receive treatment 8 week . The effect treatment measure state art computerize analysis walk balance . Questionnaires obtain information severe dizziness also administer . The study help therapist understand inner ear problem affect walk balance . It also provide information optimum method provide vestibular rehabilitation thus improve patient care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Versus Virtual Reality Based Vestibular Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral vestibular disease result vertigo , dizziness , dysequilibrium gait problem . Recovery result process know vestibular compensation visual proprioceptive input upregulated , remain vestibular function recalibrated utilised effectively ( Curthoys , 2000 ) . Patients compensate remain significantly impair . They benefit specialised assessment treatment technique collectively refer vestibular rehabilitation ( Hillier McDonnell , 2011 ) . This form rehabilitation root empirical work Cawthorne Cooksey , 1940 's first document important role exercise recovery vestibular injury ( Cooksey , 1945 ) recently study investigate vestibular adaptation ( Schubert et al. , 2008 ) . Vestibular rehabilitation program consider motor learn program thus require practice feedback . In conventional rehabilitation difficult patient gain feedback performance perform balance exercise repetitive boring . Force plate technology use clinical set provide visual auditory feedback show promising result ( Teggi et al. , 2009 ) . Virtual reality , define ' high-end-computer interface involve real time simulation interaction multiple sensorial channel ' ( Burdea Coiffet , 2003 ) also investigated laboratory setting . There support use virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation ( Viirre Sitarz , 2002 ) technology presently prohibitively expensive universally available . They require considerable therapist time unlikely used frequency require motor learning ( particularly vestibular rehabilitation program entail daily exercise ) . Recent development game industry result Nintendo Wii 速 Fit Plus , combine force platform accelerometer provide visual auditory feedback subject ' centre gravity virtual reality exercise game . It stimulate movement perturbs balance order retrain . Use low cost gaming system could easily adapt meet requirement vestibular rehabilitation program . The system allow accurate monitoring use term time frequency area proven difficult monitor research clinical application due inaccurate patient recall . It fun use therefore may motivate patient . The rehabilitation community begin investigate technology area balance retraining ( Nitz et al . 2009 ) . Anecdotal report indicate Wii use vestibular rehabilitation ( Hain , 2011 ) yet randomise control trial exist . It important measure effect technology easily incorporate home environment compare conventional treatment recommend use . In tandem also important gain insight patient satisfaction treatment . Aim To compare outcome conventional vestibular rehabilitation virtual reality base vestibular rehabilitation treatment unilateral vestibular disease . Objectives To compare effect conventional vestibular rehabilitation virtual reality base rehabilitation gait . To compare effect conventional vestibular rehabilitation virtual reality base rehabilitation subjective complaint dizziness/vertigo . To compare effect conventional vestibular rehabilitation virtual reality base rehabilitation balance . To compare effect conventional vestibular rehabilitation virtual reality base vestibular rehabilitation dynamic visual acuity . To quantify patient satisfaction conventional virtual reality base vestibular rehabilitation . Trial design The study design assessor blind randomise control trial . There moderate strong evidence literature efficacy vestibular rehabilitation , therefore `` '' treatment group deem ethical . Participants Patients attend otolaryngology neurology outpatient clinic Beaumont Hospital Royal Victoria Eye Ear Hospital invite participate trial . Sample Size Calculation . Allowing 10 % drop , maximum 48 participant need recruit group ( 80 % power detect p &lt; 0.05 outcome ) . A two year recruitment period require . The inclusion criterion ; - Clinical diagnosis peripheral vestibular dysfunction neurological deficit ( confirm possible vestibular function test ; canal paresis &gt; 20 % ) . - One follow subjective complaint indicate failure vestibular compensation ; disequilibrium , gait instability , vertigo/dizziness , motion sensitivity . - Not take medication vertigo willing discontinue permission consultant physician . The exclusion criterion ; - Bilateral peripheral vestibular pathology . - CNS involvement . - Fluctuating Symptoms ( Meniere 's disease , migrainous vertigo ) active BPPV . - Other medical condition acute phase ( orthopaedic injury ) . - Previous vestibular rehabilitation . - Pacemaker , Epilepsy ( per Nintendo Wii Guidelines ) . - Unwilling unable use Nintendo Wii . Randomisation Following baseline assessment participant randomise one two group ; 1 . Conventional vestibular rehabilitation 2 . Virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation A third party ( involved day day run trial ) use online randomisation program assign participant either conventional treatment virtual reality treatment advance recruitment . The treat physiotherapist inform group allocation consent obtain baseline assessment complete . Intervention Based current evidence literature time frame 6 treatment 8 week provide . The intervention group base six identify core element vestibular rehabilitation use current clinical practice- education , relaxation , adaptation exercise , habituation exercise , balance gait retrain re-conditioning ( Meldrum McConn Walsh , 2011 ) . Programs customise participant depend presenting symptom impairment , progressive . All participant ask perform home exercise program daily 30 minute . Where participant deem risk fall , provide necessary preventative instruction . Participants virtual reality group instruct use Nintendo Wii 速 give one loan . They provide customised program virtual reality equivalent conventional exercise . Those conventional group provide foam balance mat . Participants see weekly re-assessment , progression exercise advice . Measurement compliance home treatment All participant provide diary record compliance home exercise program . The Nintendo Wii 速 fit plus record type , duration frequency exercise also use record virtual reality group . Data enter cod Microsoft Excel statistical analysis perform use PASW Stata 11 . Intention treat analysis perform . Data examine normality normal distribution observe t-tests , ANOVA model use analysis interval data adjustment baseline value . The non-parametric equivalent use data normally distribute non-parametric . Differences baseline calculate primary secondary outcome within group group time point . A significance level p &lt; 0.05 set . Effect size within group comparison calculate .</detailed_description>
