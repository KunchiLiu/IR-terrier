	<brief_summary>Increased use radial access cardiac catheterization advocate study show low arterial access relate complication rate higher patient satisfaction compare femoral access . However , little known patient prior coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) . The RADIAL CABG Trial randomized-controlled trial propose test hypothesis bypass graft angiography intervention via radial access provide low vascular complication rate , similar contrast equipment utilization higher patient satisfaction compare transfemoral approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RADIAL Versus Femoral Access Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Angiography Intervention ( RADIAL-CABG ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III , single-center , prospective , randomized trial compare resource utilization , clinical outcome patient satisfaction radial femoral access patient prior coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery undergo coronary graft angiography intervention . During clinically-indicated coronary angiography patient prior CABG , amount resource use , radiation exposure patient operator , occurence complication patient satisfaction compare two treatment arm determine whether compare femoral approach radial access result : 1. similar contrast utilization ( primary endpoint ) 2. similar procedure time ( secondary endpoint ) 3. similar fluoroscopy time ( secondary endpoint ) 4. similar radiation exposure patient - measure DAP [ dose area product ] AK [ air kerma ] ( secondary endpoint ) 5. similar radiation exposure operator use portable radiation dose measure device ( secondary endpoint ) 6. similar number type catheter guidewires use ( secondary endpoint ) 7. reduction vascular access complication ( secondary endpoint ) 8. reduction overall complication ( vascular access complication , injury , bleeding , death , emergency coronary bypass surgery , stroke , acute myocardial infarction ) ( secondary endpoint ) 9. high patient satisfaction measure standardized survey 24-hours procedure ( secondary endpoint )</detailed_description>
