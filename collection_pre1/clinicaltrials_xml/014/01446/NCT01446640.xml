	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) traumatic disorder result functional deficit usually lead severe permanent paralysis . Pharmacological rehabilitation therapy SCI get limited effect . Another promising therapeutic approach SCI cellular transplantation . Cell type use SCI therapy include Schwann cell , olfactory ensheathing cell adult stem cell , neural stem cell , umbilical cord blood derive cell , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) induce pluripotent stem cell . There yet conclusive evidence type glial adult stem cell effective SCI treatment . MSC show promote anatomical functional recovery animal model SCI promote tissue sparing , axonal regeneration , remyelination . Therapeutic effect MSCs primarily due secretion soluble factor provision extracellular matrix provide protection support repair . MSC attractive candidate transplantation human patient easily harvest , expand bank , derive directly patient allow autologous transplantation , obviate need immune suppression . The clinical translation cellular transplantation strategy require safe efficient mean cellular delivery . In animal model SCI , common delivery direct injection injury site , allow define number cell deliver , risk injure cord . Less invasive method cell delivery investigate , include intravascular delivery ( intravenous ( IV ) intra-arterial ) delivery cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal ) . These minimally-invasive technique decrease risk patient allow delivery multiple cell dos . Maybe intrathecal administration superior IV delivery , cell engraftment tissue spar significantly well intrathecal delivery , research need get conclusion .</detailed_description>
