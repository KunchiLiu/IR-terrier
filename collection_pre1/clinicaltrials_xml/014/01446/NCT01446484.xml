	<brief_title>Treatment Children With Kidney Transplants Injection CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T Cells Prevent Organ Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation common procedure hospital , organ rejection serious side effect potential problem patient . Alemtuzumab monoclonal antibody CD52 bind deplete excess T cell bone marrow leukemia patient . In study alemtuzumab use deplete recipient 's white blood cell ( WBCs ) time transplantation . An experimental group patient receive two injection autologous CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+ T regulatory cell expand ex vivo day 30 day 180 transplantation . T regulatory cell responsible immune system tolerance induction . Treatment cell believe create tolerance T cell immune response transplant alloantigens decrease . This study evaluate safety effectiveness antirejection regimen include alemtuzumab immunosuppressive medication combine autologous T regs injection patient undergo kidney transplantation ( Tx ) . Patients receive i.v . injection alemtuzumab Days 14-21 Tx Day 0 . Starting Day 0 , patient begin take either tacrolimus cyclosporine , Day 2-3 - mycophenolate mofetil . This study continue three year . Participants randomly assign receive either full immunosuppressive therapy autologous T regs s.c. injection ( group 1 ) immunosuppressive therapy alone ( group 2 ) . Prior immunosuppressive therapy group 1 , blood sample collect twice least one-week interval collection amount 70 ml/1,73 m2 . Two ml blood collect start immunosuppressive therapy level T regs periphery blood examine flow cytometry analysis group . T cell CD4+ separate blood sample freeze liquid nitrogen . All patient undergo kidney transplantation . One month transplantation flow cytometry analysis blood sample perform group . The patient group 1 undergo subcutaneous injection approximately 2x10^8 autologous T regs expand previously frozen CD4+ cell month 180 day transplantation . One week follow injection , additional flow cytometry analysis perform evaluate T reg level patient 's blood . The level T regs patient 's blood repeat group 90-120 day follow transplantation . Patients monitor three year post-transplantation . Urine sample collect one week 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 month follow transplantation . Kidney biopsy perform Months 1 , 12 , 36 . Based result biopsy analysis , kidney function sign over-immunosuppression , patient switch CNIs ( calcineurin inhibitor , tacrolimus cyclosporine ) PSIs regiment ( sirolimus everolimus ) .</detailed_description>
