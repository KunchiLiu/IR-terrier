	<brief_title>R-2cda Prolongation Therapy With Rituximab Alone Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia ( CLL ) lymphoproliferative disorder characterize progressive accumulation monoclonal peripheral B cell bone marrow , peripheral blood lymphoid tissue . Median survival 10 year . It clear front line therapy patient CLL require treatment association purine analogue rituximab without cyclophosphamide . Concerning choice purine analogue , similar result obtain use cladribine instead fludarabine . Although cladribine le commonly use , direct comparison two analogue concern efficacy toxicity , confirm profile two drug . Encouraging result obtain use monoclonal antibody association purine analogue . The utilization rituximab maintenance therapy could improve response case persistence minimal residual disease well delay insurgence relapse thus increase DFS . The objective study confirm efficacy association R-2cda evaluate efficacy prolongation therapy additional infusion Rituximab alone increase prolong duration response . The result study compare exist clinical result group 42 pt already treat standard R-2cda without additional rituximab infusion . Patients enrol study receive 4 cycle R-2-CdA therapy . Patients , achieve partial response complete response therapy R- 2-CdA , prolong therapy Rituximab . The therapy begin 3 month end induction therapy patient receive one administration every 2 month total 8 administration .</detailed_description>
