	<brief_title>Reducing Alcohol Exposed Pregnancy Risk : EARLY Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drinking woman risk alcohol-exposed pregnancy ( AEP ) use contraception ineffectively . Binge drinking among woman childbearing age increase , risky frequent drinking remain stable group woman . Although many woman stop reduce drink realize pregnant , pregnancy recognition occur 4th 6th week gestation woman . Serious harm occur fetus , especially week 3 10 gestation , woman drink period . Additionally , increase number woman drink pregnancy , despite public health warning scientific proof alcohol teratogen . Although many woman aware Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ( FAS ) , aware even low level alcohol exposure could lead alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder alcohol-related birth defect ( ARND , ARBD ) , know Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ( FASD ) . Intervening conception woman risk AEP could eliminate case FASD . Women risk problem drinker fail use contraception effectively , ineffective contraception sometimes drink risk level . Intervention could focus postponing pregnancy among problem drinker , reduce drinking among woman forgo pregnancy prevention , . Motivational interview focus dual behavior compose risk AEP promising approach . A five session , dual-focused motivational interviewing plus contraception counsel intervention effective woman risk AEP seek treatment . Unfortunately , even though intervention may prove effective , unlikely adopt community setting due length cost . What need less costly , transportable brief intervention use effective component longer intervention , delivers condense format . A briefer intervention could use woman await service add exist therapeutic service , thus could large public health impact reduce risk AEP woman draw diverse setting . A single-session intervention , Project Balance , show evidence efficacy college woman , require adaptation less educate community-based woman severe drink problem le contraception use . The next step need advance field develop test less time-intensive intervention build effective theory-based intervention , test intervention woman draw high risk setting . The purpose Stage 1b project develop test efficacy brief , theory-based , behavioral intervention among high-risk community sample fertile woman particularly high risk alcohol-exposed pregnancy ( AEP ) . Because prevention AEP achieve whether woman change drinking OR contraception , primary endpoint rate risky drink ineffective contraception six-month follow-up , addition dichotomously define `` successful outcome '' observe whenever woman sufficiently alter one behavior place risk AEP . The goal identify transferable intervention effectively reduce behavior put woman risk AEP alcohol-related birth defect include FASD . The specific aim : 1 . Develop `` Exploring Alcohol Contraception Risks Limit You '' ( EARLY ) intervention , refine train method material , train therapist deliver intervention accurately . 2 . Develop measure internal validity fidelity intervention , establish psychometric property . 3 . Test efficacy EARLY intervention minimal intervention condition control effect assessment , time , attention . Efficacy retain participant , reduce drinking , increase contraception test pilot randomize trial woman draw target population : setting serve problem drinker ( outpatient drug alcohol treatment setting ) woman ineffective contraceptive habit ( STD public health clinic ) 4 . Develop material need Stage 2 efficacy trial , include evidence feasibility promise EARLY intervention , treatment manual , therapist training material , final instrumentation package . 5 . Examine role variable group assignment ( alcohol problem severity , psychiatric co-morbidity , drug use/severity , trans-theoretical model variable ( readiness , stage , process change , self efficacy , therapeutic alliance ) mediate moderate response , examine secondary outcome intervention , change readiness .</detailed_description>
