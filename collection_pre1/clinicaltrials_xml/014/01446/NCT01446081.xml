	<brief_title>An Exercise Trial Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML ) Patients Undergoing Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) life-threatening malignant blood disorder . Curative treatment require multiple cycle intensive chemotherapy . The first cycle , induction , intense intend achieve complete disease remission ( CR ) . Induction therapy require 4-6 week inpatient admission associate extend bed rest multiple toxicity , lead physical deconditioning . Regular exercise induction may reduce decline physical fitness , lead improve quality life ( QOL ) , reduce fatigue , improve tolerance chemotherapy , potentially great survival . Four prior study exercise AML patient undergo induction suggest improvement QOL , fatigue , physical function , treatment tolerability . However , 4 study suffer major limitation include small sample size , design limitation , generalizability concern , limited safety information . The investigator conduct pilot non-randomized study 35 AML patient demonstrate feasibility , safety , potential improvement QOL , fatigue , physical fitness outcomes . The investigator propose rigorous evaluation intervention phase II randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Primary objective include : ( 1 ) To determine efficacy supervise mixed-modality exercise program induction chemotherapy QOL fatigue ; ( 2 ) To determine efficacy physical fitness . Our secondary objective determine efficacy AML treatment tolerability ( hospital length stay , development sepsis , intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission , delay consolidation chemotherapy ) .</detailed_description>
