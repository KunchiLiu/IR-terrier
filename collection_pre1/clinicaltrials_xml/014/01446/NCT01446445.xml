	<brief_summary>The objective present study optimize intravenous ganciclovir ( GCV ) oral valganciclovir ( VGCV ) dose , advise drug exposure , indicate area concentration time curve ( AUC ) , renal transplant patient receive oral VGCV intravenous GCV CMV prophylaxis treatment . The initial dos calculate accord population pharmacokinetic model . Subsequent dos adjust accord plasma GCV concentration , use Bayesian approach . This method dose adjustment could lead increase percentage patient achieve therapeutic exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualization Ganciclovir Valganciclovir Doses Using Bayesian Prediction Renal Transplant Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The area concentration time curve serum concentration GCV indicator systemic exposure drug relate effectiveness safety . According population model develop group , less 16 % patient treat achieve therapeutic goal AUC ( 40 50 mcg â€¢ h / L ) drug dose accord summary product characteristic ( SPC ) . Especially , patient impair renal function value ( creatinine clearance ( CrC ) l &lt; 30 ml / min ) high ( CrCl &gt; 70 ml / min ) would overdose underdosed , respectively , risk adverse effect therapeutic failure . Therefore , individualization dosage GCV , contribute greatly achieve optimal exposure drug transplant patient , especially case extreme value renal function ( CrCl decrease high ) . As consequence , minimize adverse effect , ensure great efficiency target population reduce associate cost .</detailed_description>
