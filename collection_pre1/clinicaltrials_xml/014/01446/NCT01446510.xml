	<brief_title>Systematic Review Meta-Analysis Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) Risk Assessment Hospitalized Medical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( `` VTE '' include pulmonary embolism `` PE '' deep venous thrombosis `` DVT '' ) associate significant morbidity mortality . Only half eligible hospitalized medical patient receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis . Understanding VTE risk factor predictive VTE among hospitalized medical patient may promote superior thromboprophylaxis . To date systematic review VTE risk assessment strategy among hospitalized medical patient , meta-analysis reporting rate VTE among patient group vary level risk VTE exist . The investigator use Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) checklist report systematic review meta-analyses develop systematic review meta-analysis . The investigator perform systematic review literature report VTE risk assessment model derive validated among hospitalized medical patient . The investigator perform meta-analysis study report rate VTE among patient identify elevated risk VTE . The investigator pre-specify go analyze prospective retrospective study capture literature search two way . First , investigator perform analysis group prospective retrospective study together . The investigator also perform analysis separate prospective retrospective study . While decrease sample size ( thus power ) , approach may allow u identify bias confound present due retrospective study design control . Notably confirmation retrospective prospective study identify finding would enhance clinical usefulness finding .</detailed_description>
