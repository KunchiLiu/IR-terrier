	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study pazopanib hydrochloride follow chemotherapy surgery treat patient soft tissue sarcoma . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth may also stop growth soft tissue sarcoma block blood flow tumor . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Followed Chemotherapy Surgery Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine absolute value change standardize uptake value ( SUV ) fludeoxyglucose F18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) 14 day Run-in period pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) versus placebo , compare change SUV follow pre-operative chemotherapy . II . To evaluate correlation antiangiogenic activity pazopanib drug exposure . III . To assess response rate Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria 14 day Run-in period pazopanib versus placebo compare response rate follow pre-operative chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine activity antiangiogenic therapy pazopanib combine pre-operative chemotherapy high risk extremity soft tissue sarcoma measure : histological necrosis surgery ; change plasma tumor biomarker assay angiogenesis II . To evaluate safety sequential treatment pazopanib pre-operative chemotherapy doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) ifosfamide . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD . Treatment continue 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-3 ifosfamide IV day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Beginning 2-4 week later , patient undergo surgery follow 2 course chemotherapy 2-4 week completion surgery . Some patient may also undergo adjuvant external beam radiation therapy 5 day week 5 day follow boost . Patients treat Arm I may resume pazopanib hydrochloride 1 week completion adjuvant therapy 1 year . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
