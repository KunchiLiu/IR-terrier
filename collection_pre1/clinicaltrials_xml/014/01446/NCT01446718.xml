	<brief_title>A Cohort Study Assess Sustained Immunogenicity qHPV Vaccine Among HIV-infected Girls Boys Age 9-14 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected individual bear disproportionate disease burden HPV-related disease suggest rapid progression HPV acquisition malignancy . HIV infected woman 2-22 fold increase risk cervical cancer compare uninfected woman . The quadrivalent HPV vaccine market `` Gardasil '' demonstrate efficacy type specific HPV infection know cause 70 % cervical cancer ( HPV 16 &amp; 18 ) HPV 6 &amp; 11 know cause 90 % anogenital wart population HIV negative young woman .

Extended follow HIV-uninfected individual show sustained response HPV vaccine 8.4 6 year respectively bivalent quadrivalent vaccine . However , vaccine hepatitis B vaccine show require additional dosage effective among HIV-infected person . Data immunogenicity HPV vaccine among HIV infect adolescent limit 12 month follow period . Current HPV vaccine guideline target pre-sexual adolescent . Since risk HPV exposure persist throughout individual 's sexual life , duration protection provide vaccination critical overall vaccine effectiveness . Duration sustain HPV 6/11/16/18 antibody response directly relate vaccine effectiveness determines need booster dose . The investigator therefore propose extend follow 179 girl boys Kenya , age 9-14 year receive 3 dos quadrivalent 'Gardasil ' vaccine ass immunogenicity annually .
