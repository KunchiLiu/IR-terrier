	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common progressive neurodegenerative disorder cause loss dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra . A combination genetic environmental factor likely important produce abnormal protein aggregation within select group neurones , lead cell dysfunction death . A large number agent together surgical intervention available treat early late complication PD , suffer two main drawback : side effect loss efficacy disease progression . Bone marrow ( BM ) derive mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) differentiate certain circumstance cell various neuronal glial type lineage ; also exert immunomodulatory effect . PD-derived MSCs similar normal MSCs phenotype , morphology , multidifferentiation capacity . Moreover , PD-derived MSCs capable differentiating neuron specific medium 30 % characteristic dopamine cell . These finding indicate MSCs derive PD patient ' bone marrow may promise cell type cellular therapy . BM-MSCs culture cocktail growth factor ( contain FGF BDNF ) differentiate neuronal/glial lineage cell predominance cell express astrocyte ' marker . They effective suppression chronic EAE mouse induce neuroprotection , preserve axon CNS successfully-treated animal . Histopathological study reveal MSCs could efficiently migrate CNS inflamed tissue ( administer intravenously intraventricularly ) differentiate cell express neural-glial lineage marker . Such approach may provide feasible practical way PD .</detailed_description>
