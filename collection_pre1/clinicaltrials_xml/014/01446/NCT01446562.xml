	<brief_title>Y90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Post R-CHOP Chemotherapy Advanced Stage Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized , open label , single-centre phase II trial R-CHOP follow 90Y-RIT patient previously untreated , high-risk , advanced stage follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients meet inclusion criterion ( exclusion criterion ) receive first line treatment R-CHOP regimen . R-CHOP comprises rituximab 375 milligram per square meter ( mg/m2 ) intravenously ( IV ) , cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2 IV , doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV , vincristine 1.4mg/m2 IV ( maximum dose 2.0mg ) day 1 prednisone 100mg per o ( po ) daily 5 day . Treatment cycle repeat every 3 week total 6 cycle . Patients evaluate response accord 3 6 cycle R-CHOP ( see response definition ) . Dose modification non-hematologic hematologic adverse event guide NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 3.0 ( CTCAE ) . After 3 cycle R-CHOP , patient disease progression go study responder continue treatment . Patients stable disease continue protocol discontinue study , decide treat physician . Final response evaluation R-CHOP induction take place 4-6 week 6th cycle . Patients disease progression go study , stable disease evidence response eligible post-induction 90Y-RIT . Post-induction 90Y-RIT administer within 4-8 week completion R-CHOP regimen . Patients must meet criteria administration 90Y-RIT therapy , include : ( 1 ) achievement least stable disease determine 4-6 week completion R-CHOP therapy ; ( 2 ) repeat bone marrow investigation confirm less 25 % marrow involvement follicular lymphoma ; ( 3 ) platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 . Eligible patient receive infusion rituximab 250mg/m2 day 1 follow week later ( day 8 ) additional dose rituximab single dose 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan dose 0.4 milliCurries per kilogram ( mCi/kg ) patient platelet count â‰¥150,000/mm3 0.3 mCi/kg patient platelet &lt; 150,000/cubic millimeter ( mm3 ) . The maximum dose regardless weight 32 mCi . Dosimetry image study biodistribution mandate protocol . The primary endpoint study final complete response ( CR ) rate , define accord International Working Group criterion , measure 3 month completion treatment ( measure day 1 90Y-RIT therapy ) . Hence , CR imply elimination lymphoma manifestation include complete disappearance detectable clinical radiographic evidence disease disease-related symptom present therapy . Secondary outcome include determination overall partial response ( PR ) rate conversion partial responses/stable disease complete response . A subset patient ( pre-treatment polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis positive characteristic ( 14 ; 18 ) ( q32 ; q21 ) B Cell Lymphoma-2 gene/Immunoglobulin Heavy chain ( BCL2/IGH ) translocation associate follicular lymphoma ) monitor quantitative PCR minimal residual disease molecular remission rate document ( conversion PCR positive negative ) . Time-to-event outcome include time-to-treatment failure , time progression , overall survival . The frequency severity side effect record accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 3.0 ( CTCAE ) . The safety tolerability study drug evaluate relevant laboratory parameter 2 week interval induction chemotherapy follow administration 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan final response assessment ( 3 month radioimmunoconjugate dose ) . Thereafter , parameter repeat quarterly first 2 year , restaging visit thereafter . Long-term adverse event include development myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia , secondary cancer . Immunoquantitation vaccine-specific immunity ( serology ) also assay long-term follow-up period . The study expect accrue 24-month period . The time-to-event outcome continue assessed follow-up period , schedule end 2 year last patient receive 90Y-RIT . Restaging carry 3 6 cycle R-CHOP induction therapy , 3 month administration 90Y-RIT ( final response assessment ) . Thereafter , restaging carry every 6 month completion 2 year follow-up period .</detailed_description>
