It know whether use cell phone electronic monitoring bipolar disorder way describe improve outcome compare use cell phone usual communication . A total 60 patient bipolar disorder randomise ( 1:1 ) use active cell phone program ( intervention group ) use cell phone usual communication ( control group ) . All randomise patient receive cell phone ( Android ) use study period . Stratification do age ( 18-30 versus 30-60 year ) prior hospitalisation ( none versus hospitalisation ) . Study period : 6 month The assessment do PhD.-student involved treatment randomise patient blind versus receive intervention system control system .
