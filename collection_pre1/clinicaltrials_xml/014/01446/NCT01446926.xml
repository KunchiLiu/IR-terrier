	<brief_summary>This study design explore safety tolerability investigational pneumococcal vaccine step-down enrollment . Primary Objective : - To evaluate safety tolerability investigational pneumococcal vaccine . Secondary Objective : - To evaluate immunogenicity investigational pneumococcal vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigational Pneumococcal Vaccine Healthy Adults , Toddlers Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult participant receive single injection study vaccine placebo . After satisfactory safety evaluation , toddler participant receive single injection study vaccine placebo . After satisfactory safety evaluation , infant participant receive 3 injection study vaccine placebo dose-ascending order ( low , medium , high dose ) , safety evaluation dose level study proceeds next high dose . All participant undergo immunogenicity test monitoring safety .</detailed_description>
