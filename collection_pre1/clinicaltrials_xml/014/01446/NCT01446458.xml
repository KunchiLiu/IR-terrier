	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether use FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) prior surgery patient pancreatic cancer safe well tolerate . This study obtain preliminary data response cancer therapy Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) study cancer resect surgically . In addition , investigator perform biochemical study tumor tissue obtain tissue biopsy well tumor remove surgeon order measure effect treatment FOLFIRINOX SBRT several protein may important behavior pancreatic cancer cell . The data obtain trial extremely valuable help improve approach treat pancreatic cancer future . If undergo surgery completion FOLFIRINOX + SBRT , investigator request second biopsy tumor computer tomography ( CT ) -guidance order measure effect treatment tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy FOLFIRINOX Neoadjuvant Therapy Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care treat early stage pancreatic cancer involve surgery follow chemotherapy / chemoradiotherapy use conventional fractionated external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) . Despite incorporation multi-modality adjuvant therapy follow surgery , patient surgically resect pancreas cancer high likelihood recurrence cancer and/ death disease . Patients advance pancreatic cancer experience even bad outcome face unresectable disease lower likelihood achieve negative margin resection . In particular group patient , chemotherapy radiation give prior surgery may help select patient likely ultimately benefit pancreaticoduodenectomy may improve rate margin negative resection , factor may influence outcome . Systemic chemotherapy traditionally use treatment pancreatic cancer include drug gemcitabine 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Recently , multi-agent chemotherapy regimen call FOLFIRINOX show significant efficacy patient advance pancreatic cancer improve tumor response improve overall outcome reasonable toxicity profile . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) unique radiation technique allow high dos radiation deliver cancer significantly short period time compare conventional radiation . SBRT 's advantage conventional radiation include : short duration therapy ( one three day versus two five week ) well ability deliver full dose chemotherapy . In treat patient pancreatic cancer , SBRT tolerate effective compare historically conventional radiation . SBRT combine chemotherapy also well tolerated patient pancreatic cancer . This study ask whether give chemotherapy FOLFIRINOX follow short sequence radiation therapy use Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) safe feasible . This study also begin ask effect approach rate margin negative resection patient may subsequently undergo surgery pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
