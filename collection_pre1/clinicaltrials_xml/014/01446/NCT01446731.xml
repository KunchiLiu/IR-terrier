	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial include 40 patient castration resistant metastatic cancer prostate ( CRMPC ) . Patients randomize treatment dendritic cell vaccine plus docetaxel docetaxel alone . The primary objective evaluate vaccine specific immune response patient evlauated blood test DTH reaction treatment course . Secondary objective evaluate clinical response objective response ( RECIST-criteria , 18F-NaF-PET/CT scan ) , PSA response , pain response finally determine time progression overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell Vaccination Docetaxel Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment detail : Dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccination The DC vaccine consist adherent monocyte collect leukapheresis . Monocytes stimulate GM-CSF IL-4 , IL-1β , TNFα , IL-6 PGE2 use maturation . DCs transfected PSA , PAP , survivin hTERT mRNA . DC vaccine give patient ARM A Docetaxel : Docetaxel give i.v . infusion every third week , 75 mg/m2 accord standard treatment . Patients pretreated prednisolon infusion Docetaxel . Continuous treatment prednisolon administer . Treatment schedule : The DC vaccination administer week two three week first 12 week . After 12 week DC vaccination give every three week long Docetaxel give . If disease progress patient stop treatment Docetaxel ( side effect ) vaccine treatment continue disease progression . Evaluation detail : Immunological evaluation : Blood test : 100 ml blood drawn patient together first ( baseline ) , third fourth infusion Docetaxel , every third month thereafter . DTH : DTH 3 i.d . injection consist medium ( neg . test ) , naked DCs mRNA transfected DCs perform baseline ( together 1st vaccine ) , together 5th vaccine three month treatment ( 8th vaccine ) . 48 hour DTH 5th vaccine biopsy take DTH area . Clinical evaluation : PSA : Patients evaluate PSA measurement treatment . All patient receive least 4 treatment Docetaxel even PSA rise . 18F-NaF ( `` bone '' ) PET/CT scan : All patient bone-PET/CT scan baseline . For patient measurable lesion PET/CT scan perform every three month .</detailed_description>
