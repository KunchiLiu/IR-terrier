	<brief_summary>Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BM-MNC ) treat patient chronic limb ischemia prove safe effective . However , process bone marrow Ficoll density gradient centrifugation time consume also expensive . Manually process bone marrow also result large variation therapeutic cell quantity quality directly lead deviation safety efficacy cell therapy . This study aim compare automate bone marrow processing system conventional manual method term safety efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BM-MNC ) treat patient chronic limb ischemia prove safe effective . However , process bone marrow Ficoll density gradient centrifugation time consume also expensive . Manually process bone marrow also result large variation therapeutic cell quantity quality directly lead deviation safety efficacy cell therapy . This study aim compare automate bone marrow processing system conventional manual method term safety efficacy . ResQ system develop Thermogenesis USA provide automatic cell processing system bone marrow . The system take less 30 minute concentrate therapeutic mononuclear cell include stem cell close system without add additive separation reagent ( Ficoll ) . The system also able operate point care . The study design prove inferior safety efficacy bone marrow cell process ResQ cell use conventional manual method . The conventional manual method involve Ficoll density gradient centrifugation cell wash stem open system . Each test arm ( ResQ vs manual method ) consist 25 patient . The primary outcome safety measure cell treatment-related adverse event . The secondary endpoint include rest ankle-brachial pressure index ( ABI ) toe brachial pressure index ( TBI ) , transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( TcPO2 ) , claudication distance , rest pain scale evaluation , collateral vessel scale , etc .</detailed_description>
