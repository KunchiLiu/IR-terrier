	<brief_summary>Parkinson´s disease ( PD ) diagnosis base upon clinical examination . Although imaging help doctor identify many disease , still add much information diagnosis Parkinson´s disease . The investigator go perform large sample study include PD patient , essential tremor healthy volunteer order evaluate MRI help diagnosis . Our hypothesis fractional anisotropy ( FA ) caudal portion substantia nigra decrease PD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Diagnosis Parkinson 's Disease Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) base set clinical assessment provide great accuracy . Although magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) transcranial sonography ( TCS ) provide important advance diagnosis number neurological disease , biomarkers PD describe order support clinical diagnosis . Recently , one single study show high field MRI use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) able discriminate PD healthy volunteer . This study small sample size ( 14 patient 14 control ) include main differential diagnosis PD . The main objective study confirm previous finding , large sample size , describe possible change DTI parameter patient essential tremor ( one main differential diagnosis PD ) , compare DTI MRI TCS . Our primary outcome fractional anisotropy ( FA ) caudal portion substantia nigra . As consequence , new algorithm discriminate PD , essential tremor healthy volunteer propose . This pivotal importance order provide support clinical diagnosis PD increase accuracy .</detailed_description>
