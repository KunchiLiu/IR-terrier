	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate predictive value presence absence cardiac activity bedside ultrasound cardiac arrest . The investigator anticipate base previous research patient suffer cardiac arrest cardiac activity bedside ultrasound great chance survive hospital admission . The investigator hypothesis mortality rate patient cardiac arrest cardiac activity ultrasound mortality rate 100 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REASON 1 Trial : Sonography Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , observational trial involve site across United States Canada . Patients enrol emergency department either present cardiac arrest , go cardiac arrest emergency department . Patients develop cardiac arrest inpatient also enrol center capable enrol inpatient subject . Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) protocols institutional policy resuscitation follow , current standard care . A patient encounter conclude upon halt cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Final disposition patient evaluate chart review . After initial cardiac arrest disposition direct patient interaction part study except set repeat cardiac arrest . Patients repeat arrest undergo repeat ultrasound exam continue meet inclusion criterion . The repeat episode record continuation event separate enrollment . Subject data , Protected Health Information ( PHI ) remove , uploaded REDcap web-based database soon possible within 7 day final disposition . Data obtain initial patient encounter , patient record , EMS record available . Additional data may obtain chart review obtain data point available initial contact . Individual sit keep secured record enable identification patient source data review require . Patient information include 6 type data , past medical history , event surround cardiac arrest , action take health care professional , peri-arrest presentation , peri-arrest intervention , patient outcomes . Health care professional action include ACLS medication administration , airway management , chest compression , defibrillation , pacing , resuscitative intervention . Specific data point list paper version electronic Case Report Form , CRF , see Appendix A. Sonography hinder impair resuscitative effort way , include halt CPR prolong pause cardiopulmonary rescusitation ( CPR ) . Sonographic image obtain designated pause chest compression , routine care , CPR pulse check , rhythm check , necessary resuscitative procedure . Single multi-view echocardiography perform appropriate obtain diagnostic information particular patient resuscitative effort . Recording image loop perform image acquisition accord standard technology availability site . To facilitate image acquisition , ultrasound probe may place epigastrium parasternal region CPR heart center field view , interfere ongoing resuscitation . Recording image begin immediately upon pause CPR use whatever mean available site . Sonographic image obtain competent personnel experience bedside cardiac ultrasound . This information make available physician take care patient Ultrasound image consist single multiple view ( ) include subxiphoid , parasternal long axis , and/or apical 4 chamber . While primarily prefer view ; also acceptable parasternal short axis apical 2 chamber view . Image requirement base adequate echocardiographic window adequate image acquisition determine physician perform bedside ultrasound . In set difficult image patient combination view may require obtain adequate information . There least two ultrasound exam perform . The initial ultrasound exam video obtain upon first pause pulse rhythm check inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion present . The final ultrasound exam video obtain resuscitative effort halt . All ultrasound image record later review Regional Coordinating Site Local Site . Ultrasound videos interpret acquisition cardiac activity present absent valvular movement present absent . Specific video file format acceptable include MPEG4 , Quicktime ( MOV ) , DV , AVI , WMV . Files forward least monthly Site Coordinator Regional Site send within 1 week request regional coordinating site . INITIAL INTERPRETATION OF CARDIAC IMAGES The Local Site PI interpret ultrasound image information uploaded central database another database specify Central Coordinating Site . Cardiac activity initially categorize `` Cardiac Activity Present '' , `` Cardiac Activity Absent '' , Valve Movement Present '' , Valve Movement Absent '' . Cardiac activity define intrinsic movement myocardium , isolated movement cardiac valve . Valve movement define movement cardiac valve . FINAL INTERPRETATION OF CARDIAC IMAGES Cardiac image review regional site PIs sub-categories cardiac activity . A heart intrinsic cardiac movement outside isolate valvular motion categorize `` Cardiac Activity Present '' . Ultrasound image patient cardiac activity categorize : 1 . Cardiac motion No decrease chamber size 2 . Cardiac motion decrease chamber size &lt; 10 % 3 . Cardiac motion decrease chamber size &gt; 10 % . The estimated duration subject participate length cardiopulmonary resuscitation vary patient , 15 minute 1 hour , later follow ( hour day later ) determine final disposition . A summary sequence duration research activity follow . Patient interaction ( estimate 15 minute 1 hour ) - Patient identify cardiac arrest confirmation pulse . - Chest compression ACLS protocol initiate per standard care - Bedside ultrasound heart perform interpreted standard pause cardiac compression per routine care institution ( 3-6 second ) - ACLS protocol continue per standard care treat physician - Resuscitation activity halt either pronouncement patient return spontaneous circulation allow disposition plan - Bedside ultrasound heart perform interpret ( 3-6 second ) Data Acquisition ( Immediate day later via chart review ) - Final patient disposition determine - Interval event record ( ie : repeat cardiopulmonary arrest ) Data Management ( immediate day week later ) - Subject data PHI remove enter research database - Subject data PHI remove updated research database CRF complete initially - Cardiac ultrasound image PHI remove send regional site review</detailed_description>
