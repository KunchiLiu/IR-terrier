	<brief_summary>This screening study address lack molecular strategy early detection lung cancer integrate epidemiological imaging strategy . The hypothesis repeat measure biomarkers risk obtain molecular analysis biological specimen include bronchoscopy ( bronchial brushing biopsy ) may contribute refinement high-risk population allow earlier clinical diagnosis . The goal investigator study provide screen lung cancer high-risk population . In prospective cohort test whether repeat measure biomarkers risk allow early detection lung cancer .</brief_summary>
