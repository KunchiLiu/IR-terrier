	<brief_summary>Nicorandil potentially effective prevent cardiovascular event patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) receive hemodialysis . The purpose study prospectively investigate whether nicorandil effective reduce incidence cardiovascular event patient CAD hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study End Stage Renal Disease Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Treated Oral Nicorandil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hemodialysis end-stage renal disease high risk death ischemic heart disease . It report nicorandil , hybrid compound adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener nitric oxide door , potentially effective prevent cardiovascular event patient CAD receive hemodialysis . Therefore , investigator prospectively examine whether nicorandil effective reduce incidence cardiovascular event patient CAD hemodialysis . The primary endpoint composite cardiovascular death , sudden cardiac death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , hospitalization recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia stroke . The secondary endpoint total mortality , revascularization therapy , hospitalization heart failure , hospitalization peripheral artery disease newly onset atrial fibrillation . Patient population need prove hypothesis estimate 300 case total ( 150 case group ) . Investigators set parameter need calculate number study patient follow ; drop rate 10 % , event rate primary end point two year 50 % , risk reduction rate bring nicorandil 60 % , statistical power 80 % two-sided significant level 0.05 . Investigators refer event rate risk reduction rate previous study Ishi H et al . In study , event rate primary end point two year 50 % risk reduction bring nicorandil 60 % . Event rate present study lower , drug-eluting stent widely use prevent restenosis present era . Moreover , investigator include patient underwent coronary bypass graft present study . In addition , non-cardiovascular mortality high patient hemodialysis . Considering various factor together , investigator estimate study sample size .</detailed_description>
