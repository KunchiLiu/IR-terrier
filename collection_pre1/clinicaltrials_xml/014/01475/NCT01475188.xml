	<detailed_description>Allergy constitute important problem worldwide thus effective treatment crucial reduction symptom severity , patient ' activity quality life well reduction direct indirect cost disease . Specific allergen immunotherapy ( SIT ) potentially curative specific method treatment allergic disease , particularly intermittent allergic rhinitis . Specific subcutaneous immunotherapy induce peripheral tolerance suppress inflammation tissue . In periphery , effector T cell unresponsiveness antigen mediate mainly allergen specific regulatory T cell . Regulatory T cell induce peripherally comprise IL-10 produce type 1 regulatory T cell ( Tr1 ) regulatory T cell subset arise vitro CD4+CD25- vivo peripheral memory T cell whereas naturally occur Tregs ( nTregs ) originate thymus represent 5 % peripheral CD4 T cell constitutively express high level high-affinity IL-2 receptor ( CD25hi ) . They coexpress Forkhead Box Protein P3 ( Foxp3 ) , glucocorticoid induced tumor necrosis factor receptor ( GITR ) , cytotoxic T lymphocyte associate antigen ( CTLA-4 ) , display low expression alpha chain IL-7 receptor . Although clinical immunological outcome SIT , associate regulatory T cell function profoundly study , little known molecular mechanism crucial nTregs activation function course SIT . Since histamine key mediator allergy exerts effect 4 type histamine receptor decide investigate expression histamine 2 receptor , potent immunomodulatory property , regulatory lymphocytes patient treated SIT . Furthermore , since T cell receptor activation essential T effector lymphocytes activation want check expression zeta chain associate protein ( ZAP70 ) , constitute linker TCR low level intracellular downstream signal transduction , regulatory T cell course SIT . This 3-year prospective , placebo control , double blind trial grass SIT . 41 patient seasonal allergic rhinitis randomize receive SIT ( n = 21 ) placebo ( n = 20 ) 15 healthy include control . The primary secondary outcome assessed baseline treatment period - start pollen season , height pollen season end pollen season.Results compare treatment year baseline group treat SIT , placebo healthy control .</detailed_description>
