	<brief_summary>Introduction : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease condition characterize airflow limitation usually progressive associate inflammatory response lung noxious particle . During physical activity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient may develop dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation , increase dyspnea perception decrease activity performance . The investigator hypothesize specific activity daily live induce dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation COPD patient . Objective : To measure dynamic lung hyperinflation influence dyspnea perception moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient activity daily live . Methods : The investigator measure inspiratory capacity , dyspnea sensation , peripheral oxygen saturation , heart rate respiratory rate 19 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient . These measurement take rest daily living activity ( go set stair , go ramp sweep mopping room ) .</brief_summary>
