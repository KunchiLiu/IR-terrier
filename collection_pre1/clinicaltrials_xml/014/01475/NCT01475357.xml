	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal address widespread health problem pediatric cardiac infant population - poor postnatal growth - collaborative effort pediatric cardiology , cardiothoracic surgery , neonatology , microbiology , immunology . The foundational hypothesis proposal term neonate ( ≥ 37 week gestation ) complex congenital heart disease ( CHD ) vulnerable disturbance intestinal mucosal function , permeability , microflora , local immune function , ultimately result feed intolerance poor somatic growth . By identify biologic target perioperative intestinal protection , project potential shift improve paradigm perioperative care neonates complex CHD . This pilot study generate data necessary pursue K23 R01 fund investigate postnatal intestinal maturation function neonates complex CHD cyanosis , specifically pertain local immune function inflammatory response . The objective proposal perform single-center ( MUSC ) , prospective , randomized pilot trial investigate postnatal intestinal function cardiac infant follow Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To compare decrease intestinal permeability determine urine lactulose : mannitol ratio trophic breastmilk feed group ( intervention ) vs. NPO ( nothing mouth ) group ( current care ) amongst neonate complex CHD 3 different time point ( postnatal day 3-4 , post-operative day 7-8 , post-operative day 13-14 ) . H1 : Infants receive trophic breastmilk feed pre-operative period demonstrate rapid decrease intestinal permeability ( improved postnatal intestinal maturation ) first 2 week life compare infant strictly NPO pre-operative period . Specific Aim 2 : To compare duration ( day ) goal enteral feed successfully achieve trophic breastmilk feed group vs. NPO group . H1 : Infants receive trophic breastmilk feed pre-operative period successfully achieve goal enteral feed short duration time compare infant strictly NPO pre-operative period . Specific Aim 3 : To qualitatively compare intestinal microflora pattern first postpartum month determine stool microbiota trophic breastmilk feed group vs. NPO group . H1 : The microbiota pattern infant receive trophic breastmilk feed pre-operative period differ infant strictly NPO pre-operative period .</detailed_description>
