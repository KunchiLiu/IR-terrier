	<brief_title>The CHARM Trial : Chemotherapy Ablation Resolution Mucinous Pancreatic Cysts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While half pancreatic cystic lesion little malignant potential , mucinous cystic neoplasm ( MCNs ) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) carry high potential progression pancreatic cancer . Therefore , either close radiographic surveillance surgical resection generally recommended cyst . However , pancreatic surgery associate significant risk morbidity mortality patient good surgical candidate . As alternative , endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle injection ( EUS-FNI ) show moderately effective ablate cystic lesion . The goal investigation improve efficacy safety procedure compare previous version technique . This study design evaluate efficacy chemotherapeutic cocktail without prior ethanol lavage ablation pancreatic cystic neoplasm use EUS-FNI agent delivery . This paired , prospective , double-blind , randomized study include 78 patient refer Penn State Hershey Medical Center . Mucinous indeterminate pancreatic cyst 1-5cm less 5 compartment without clear communication main pancreatic duct include . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio control arm study arm . Patients randomize control arm receive ethanol lavage cyst follow injection two carefully select chemotherapeutic agent . Study arm patient receive normal saline lavage follow injection chemotherapy admixture . Patients monitor 2 hour post-procedure , follow-up CT perform 3 , 6 , 12 month , determine necessary evaluate cyst resolution . Patients may elect undergo evaluation surgical resection time , regardless response , case dedicate pathologist evaluate surgical specimen .</detailed_description>
