	<brief_summary>Primary objective : Determine whether mipomersen ( ISIS 301012 ) significantly reduce atherogenic lipid level patient severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( severe HeFH ) , define low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level ≥200 mg/dL plus presence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) /risk equivalent LDL-C level ≥300 mg/dL regardless presence CHD/risk equivalent ( refer Cohort 1 ) compare placebo . Two different mipomersen dose regimen study : subcutaneous ( SC ) mipomersen 200 mg weekly versus placebo , SC mipomersen 70 mg thrice weekly versus placebo . Secondary Objectives : - Determine whether qualitative difference safety profile 2 dosing regimen placebo Cohort 1 , patient HeFH LDL-C level ≥160 mg/dL &lt; 200 mg/dL plus presence CHD/risk equivalent ( refer Cohort 2 ) , overall study population - Determine whether qualitative difference tolerability 2 dosing regimen placebo Cohort 1 , Cohort 2 , overall study population - Further characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) 2 dose regimen Cohort 1 , Cohort 2 , overall study population - Determine whether 2 mipomersen dose regimen significantly reduce atherogenic lipid level Cohort 2 compare placebo - Obtain additional data regard ongoing safety efficacy mipomersen patient FH inadequately control LDL-C complete primary efficacy assessment visit ( PET ) Blinded Treatment Period continue treatment Open-Label Continuation Period</brief_summary>
