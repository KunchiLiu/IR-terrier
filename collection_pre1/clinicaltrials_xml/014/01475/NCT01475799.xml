	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All candidate study must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Severe aortic valve stenosis determine echocardiogram Doppler , define : mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg peak jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2 2 . Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis demonstrate angina , congestive heart failure , NYHA Functional Class ≥ II , syncope 3 . Patient extreme risk candidate open surgical aortic valve repair site Investigators ( interventional cardiologist cardiothoracic surgeon ) agree medical factor preclude operation , base conclusion probability death serious morbidity exceed probability meaningful improvement due patient 's comorbidities ( , limit , severe COPD , porcelain aorta , previous thorax irradiation ) logistic EuroSCORE ≥ 20 4 . ≥ 70 year old 5 . Patient informed nature study provide write informed consent 6 . Patient treat physician agree patient return require postprocedure followup visit Exclusion Criteria Candidates exclude study follow criterion present : 1 . Patient surgical candidate aortic valve replacement 2 . Congenital bicuspid unicuspid valve determine echocardiography 3 . Native valve annulus diameter &lt; 17mm &gt; 22mm determine screen CT scan 4 . Extreme asymmetrical calcification native aortic valve determine screen CT scan 5 . Native valvular peripheral vascular anatomy appropriate DFM bioprosthesis 18F delivery system 6 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 30 % determine rest echocardiogram 7 . Evidence acute myocardial infarction ( Refer Definitions Section 8 ) within 30 day prior study procedure 8 . Any percutaneous coronary peripheral interventional procedure perform within 30 day prior study procedure 9 . Any planned surgical percutaneous coronary peripheral procedure perform study procedure prior 30 day followup visit 10 . Need emergency surgery reason 11 . Untreated clinically significant ( &gt; 70 % obstruction ) coronary artery disease require revascularization 12 . Prior aortic mitral valve surgery 13 . Preexisting prosthetic heart valve position 14 . Mitral insufficiency great moderate determine rest echocardiography 15 . Echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation 16 . Thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) 17 . Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) &gt; 4.5 cm 18 . Presence endovascular stent graft treatment AAA TAA 19 . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 20 . Hemodynamic instability ( e.g . require inotropic support ) 21 . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) contraindicate 22 . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ) and/or endstage renal disease require dialysis time screen 23 . Active endocarditis sepsis within 6 month prior study procedure 24 . Stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 6 month prior study procedure 25 . Cardiogenic shock within 30 day prior study procedure 26 . Active peptic ulcer upper GI bleeding within 3 month prior study procedure 27 . Leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 3000/mm³ ) , acute anemia ( Hb &lt; 9 g/dL ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 ) 28 . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy refusal blood transfusion 29 . A known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel , sensitivity contrast medium , adequately premedicated 30 . Currently participate investigational drug another device trial 31 . Previously enrol study 32 . Patient refusal surgery 33 . Life expectancy think &lt; 12 month 34 . Dementia ( result either inability provide inform consent trial/procedure , prevents independent lifestyle outside chronic care facility , fundamentally complicate rehabilitation procedure compliance followup visit )</criteria>
