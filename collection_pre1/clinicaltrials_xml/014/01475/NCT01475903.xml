	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery recognize procedure choice treatment morbid obesity , result long-term effectiveness weight loss comorbidities . The two type procedure , often perform Europe , adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) , purely restrictive reversible procedure , gastric bypass ( GBP ) , irreversible procedure , associate restriction mild malabsorption . Longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) another bariatric procedure tend develop quickly . More recent , technique recognize France High Authority Health since 2008 , consist fundus great curvature resection , remove 75 % gastric volume , leave narrow gastric tube `` sleeve '' . Although malabsorption occur bariatric procedure , micronutrient deficiency possible . GBP known induce nutritional vitamin deficiency concern iron , calcium , vitamins B12 , B9 , D proteins . Restrictive procedure minor effect normal physiological digestive process could lead vitamin deficiency secondary decrease nutrient intake tendency towards avoidance certain type food due intolerance . Studies nutritional complication bariatric surgery concern essentially AGB , GBP vertical band gastroplasty ( VBG ) longer perform France . The nutritional impact LSG remain evaluate . To date , data concern evaluation nutritional status patient underwent LSG almost non-existent . Considering type surgical procedure , investigator expect observe essentially deficiency vitamin B12 iron . Indeed , define purely restrictive intervention , LSG consist gastric fundus resection site intrinsic factor production , necessary vitamin B12 absorption . Moreover , decrease hydrochloric acid production potential vomiting cause gastric resection alter iron absorption . In view increase popularity surgical technique , assessment nutritional consequence longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy seem necessary . MAIN OBJECTIVE The main objective study ass 2-year prospective follow-up , prevalence nutrient deficiency patient undergo longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy morbid obesity Obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) high 30 kg/m2 , chronic metabolic disease prevalence reach epidemic proportion . Obesity increase risk hypertension , diabetes , atherosclerosis , risk factor lead cause death worldwide—cardiovascular disease . Moreover , obesity lead obstructive sleep apnea , osteoarthritis , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , cancer , etc… ( Fried 2007 ) . It represent one society 's major public health problem ( WHO 2000 ) . The treatment obesity primarily medical matter . A multidisciplinary approach recommend nutritional , dietary psychological follow-up . It require modification life-style long-term support . However , long-term result conventional medical therapy disappointing , especially morbid obesity . Bariatric surgery recognize procedure choice treatment morbid obesity . It 's role therapeutic strategy justify long-term effectiveness weight loss comorbidities associate high body mass index . There two type bariatric procedure : - Restrictive procedure , consist reduction stomach volume : vertical band gastroplasty ( VBG ) , adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) , sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) - And combine procedure ( restrictive malabsorptive ) : gastric by-pass biliopancreatic diversion ( BPD ) without duodenal switch ( DS ) . The two type procedure often perform Europe AGB et GBP ( Coupe 2009 ) . VBG tend disappear France , biliopancreatic diversion ( BPD ) , without duodenal switch ( DS ) complex procedure reserve specific situation ( Ziegler 2009 ) . Sleeve gastrectomy relatively new bariatric procedure . It initially introduce either restrictive component BPD-DS first step stag approach weight loss . In latter , super-obese patient increase operative risk undergo SG initiate enough weight loss allow second stage gastric bypass BPD-DS . It recently use definitive bariatric surgery procedure follow report significant reduction BMI comorbidities . It recognize France High Authority Health since 2008 . SG laparoscopic bariatric procedure , fundus great curvature stomach remove , leave narrow gastric tube `` sleeve '' ( Hakea 2009 ) . Because partial gastrectomy , SG also affect ghrelin secretion orexigenic hormone . These change concentration gut peptide induce loss appetite . The acceleration gastric emptying could also participate weight loss ( Ankar 2008 ) . The advantage sleeve gastrectomy reside low rate complication compare BPG due particular absence implant device , conservation digestive continuity absence malabsorption ( Gums 2007 ) . In term weight loss , gastric by-pass appear effective , follow sleeve gastrectomy , adjustable gastric ring . According recent meta-analysis , loss weight express percentage reduce excess weight 61,6 % BPG 47,5 % GB within 2 year procedure ( Buchwald 2004 ) . Concerning sleeve gastrectomy , review literature comprise 15 study include 646 patient , show evidence reduction excess weight 49 % 56 % 6 month 1 year respectively resolution co-morbidity arterial high blood pressure type 2 diabetes , 60 100 % ( Gums : 2007 ) . The data long-term follow-up less well document . The risk nutritional deficiency depend percentage weight loss type surgical procedure perform The nutritional deficit observe gastric surgery explain various mechanism accord technique use . T BPG , restrictive malabsorptive surgery , frequently origin nutritional vitamin deficiency essentially concern protein , iron , calcium , vitamins B12 , B9 D. In contrast , absence malabsorption , nutritional deficit induce AGB less pronounce particularly link contribution deficiency due vomit , food aversion modification food supply .Studies evaluate nutritional status patient surgery scarce prevalency report deficit varies greatly accord population study , type surgery use , systematic prescription vitamin complement , duration follow-up . The frequent deficit deficiency vitamin B12 , find 1/3 one year follow BPG patient ( Malone 2008 ) . Folate deficiency ( vitamin B9 ) also frequent , arise 20 % case ( Pournaras 2009 ) . Both origin macrocytic anaemia , leucopenia , thrombopenia glossitis . Sometimes irreversible neurological affection also arise case B12 deficiency . The effect bariatric surgery vitamin D calcium rarely specify long term , important note rare observe vitamin D deficiencies pre-existent surgery affect 21 57 % obese subject accord certain study , ( Toh 2009 , Hamoui 2004 ) , responsible increase osseous fragility secondary hyper-parathyroidism . The patient risk osteomalacia would one whose BMI 50 , menopause woman , patient undergone massive loss weight surgery patient deficient vitamin D prior surgery ( Malone 2008 ) . Bariatric sideropenic anaemia also frequent surgery whether restrictive malabsorptive , affect 5 10 % subject study many 74 % accord one study ( Sadoul 2007 ) . It link contribution deficiency due decrease consumption meat , case malabsorption ( BPG ) also due lack production gastric hydrochloric acid allow conversion ferrous iron foodstuff ferric iron , absorbable form . Other vitamin deficiency report , particular deficit vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) , essentially due vomit gastric limitation , reveal intravenous drip thiamine-free glucose . Vitamin B1 deficiency , although rather rare , potentially serious neurological damage sometimes irreversible Gayet-Wernicke 's syndrome , ( Poitou 2008 ; Morel 2008 ) . Deficits liposoluble vitamin A , E K exceptional except case serious malabsorption induce bilic-pancreatic diversion duodenal switch . Zinc , magnesium selenium deficiency also describe remain rare originate mostly exoskeleton cutaneous disorder case cardiomyopathy selenium deficiency also report . To date , recommendation optimal vitamin supplementation prescribe accord method surgery use clearly define . According recent recommendation HAS surgical care adult obesity , `` medical surgical follow-up must emphasize prevention , detection , vitamin nutritional deficiency include identification clinical ( particular neurological ) biological symptom undernutrition vitamin deficiency . A systematic multivitamin supplementation must establish malabsorptive surgery ( multivitamin , vitamin D , calcium , iron vitamin B12 ) . `` However , certain author report deficiencies spite systematic prescription multivitamin supplement by-pass surgery .Data prescribed dos , control , even preliminary nutritional state surgery remain badly specify . On one hand , rarity prospective study evaluate parameter explain difficulty estimate nutritional complication . On hand , various study list refer essentially gastric by-pass , adjustable gastric ring , calibrate vertical gastroplasty tend disappear . The impact sleeve gastrectomy nutritional state patient remain specified . To date , data concern vitamin nutritional evaluation patient operate sleeve gastrectomy almost non-existent . A recent review literature reveal nutritional recommendation specifically sleeve gastrectomy mostly due small number study available . An American team study evolution nutritional assessment case sleeve gastrectomy parameter study limited albumin , haemoglobin calcium . A decrease haemoglobinaemia objectivized 5 36 patient follow 1 year .An Australian team also retrospectively estimate prevalency nutritional deficiency bariatric surgery , data concern sleeve gastrectomy significant consider large number patient lose sight 1 year ( &gt; 80 % ) ( Toh 2009 ) . The grow interest LSG surgical procedure manage morbid obesity require investigation 's metabolic consequence . In view increase popularity surgical technique evaluation nutritional repercussion sleeve gastrectomy appear indispensable . If investigator consider surgical aspect procedure , investigator would expect observe deficiency vitamin B12 iron . Indeed , define purely restrictive procedure , sleeve gastrectomy consist resection gastric fundus , seat production intrinsic factor , necessary absorption vitamin B12 . Moreover , decrease production hydrochloric acid potential vomiting cause vast gastric resection potentially effect absorption iron . The study propose aim make prospective follow-up nutritional vitamin assessment obese patient operate sleeve gastrectomy University Hospital Clermont-Ferrand . Every patient receive clinical biological assessment include dosage vitamin trace element prior surgery 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . The effect sleeve gastrectomy nutritional status operate patient thus evaluate view answer question : Is sleeve gastrectomy purely restrictive surgical technique ?</detailed_description>
