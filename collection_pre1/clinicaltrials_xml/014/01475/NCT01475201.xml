	<brief_summary>Many people diabetes and/or high blood pressure ( hypertension ) active . When people active , reduce chance heart attack stroke . Walking cheap effective way active low risk heart attack stroke . The problem many people walk enough ! The investigator study people diabetes and/or hypertension walk doctor give prescription number step walk every day . The investigator compare group , call 'active ' , another group , call 'control ' , doctor patient usually , period one year . The investigator measure number step investigator walk everyday step counter pedometer . In step count prescription group , doctor give 'active ' group pedometer , step count record book , step count prescription . The overall goal gradually increase daily step . The speed increase step count slow less active people . At visit doctor look step count record book . The doctor give new step count prescription patient . Patients two group see doctor four time year , often usually see doctor . At end one year , investigator see difference hardness artery 'active ' 'control ' group , use simple safe measurement , similar ultrasound pregnant lady . People hard artery likely heart attack stroke . The investigator suspect patient get step count prescription walk artery less hard control group . Our study help find true . In case , doctor take time prescribe step patient diabetes and/or hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High walking level reduce myocardial infarction , stroke , mortality rate overweight/obese patient diabetes and/or hypertension , work , lead Nominated Principal Applicant K. Dasgupta , indicate low daily step count patient , approximately 5,000 steps/day average 15 % reduction fall winter . A meta-analysis physical activity program indicate pedometer-based monitoring program lead high daily step count , evidence impact arterial health limit , evidence effectiveness pedometer-based strategy specifically implement usual clinical care patient diabetes and/or hypertension . The SMARTER trial address knowledge gap . PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION : Among sedentary overweight/obese adult diabetes and/or hypertension physician-delivered step count prescription integrate usual care reduce arterial stiffness usual care alone , one-year period ? Arterial stiffness ( primary outcome ) , summative indicator arterial health , precise reliable individual risk factor . An analysis Framingham Heart Study demonstrate , even adjustment traditional risk factor , increase arterial stiffness independently associate 48 % increase vascular disease risk . Co-Principal Applicant S. Daskalopoulou expert noninvasive assessment arterial stiffness well-equipped Vascular Lab fund CFI grant . STUDY DESIGN : Randomized , allocation conceal , single-blind ( outcome assessor ) , intervention allocation ratio 1:1 , multisite clinical trial . This design allow level A evidence necessary justify widespread change clinical practice . TRIAL SYNOPSIS : Given majority diabetes hypertension patient manage primary care setting , SMARTER trial intervention deliver large network primary care clinic accessible Co-Principal Applicant E. Rosenberg well diabetes internal medicine clinic throughout Montreal patient may receive primary diabetes hypertension follow-up . Twenty-four collaborate physician identify . Physicians/clinic staff obtain assent candidate within practice contact SMARTER coordinator . The number collaborate physician continue increase , include physician primary care , diabetes , hypertension , internal medicine , endocrinology clinic . Eligibility : Candidates adults 25≤BMI &lt; 40 kg/m2 follow diabetes and/or hypertension sedentary somewhat active . Evaluations : Formal trial evaluation , conduct baseline 12 month , include assessment arterial stiffness ( carotid femoral pulse wave velocity measure noninvasively applanation tonometry ) ; step count ( pedometer conceal window ) physical activity ( accelerometer ) wear one week ; fitness ( exercise stress test ; ˙VO2max ) ; anthropometric parameter ; individual vascular risk factor . Intervention arm : The physician give active trial participant pedometer , log book , step count prescription base baseline daily step count . The time frame &gt; 3,000 steps/day net increase 10 month sedentary participant ( &lt; 5,000 steps/day ) , 7 month low active participant ( 5,000-7,499 steps/day ) , 5 month somewhat active participant ( 7,500-9,999 steps/day ) . There four clinic visit one year . Control arm : Same visit frequency advice engage 30-60 minute activity day week . Sample Size : Allowing loss follow-up 17 % base previous study , investigator require sample size 364 individual ( i.e . 182 per arm ) detect 10 % difference change arterial stiffness active control arm accuracy +/- 5 % one-year period . Analysis : Intention-to-treat . Between-arm difference 'after minus change ' 95 % CIs main analysis . Addedum stress testing : Due timeline limitation , oblige forego stress test assessment October 20 , 2014 . This impact primary outcome . Moreover , stress testing require engaging walk program type 2 diabetes . We able assess impact intervention fitness ( secondary outcome ) subgroup patient ( i.e. , complete assessment October 20 , 2014 ) . IMPORTANCE : With increase number diabetes hypertension patient , press need effective efficient clinical practice strategy help physician support patient achieve arterial health benefit higher physical activity level . The SMARTER trial seek provide tool . If effectiveness demonstrate , effort make inclusion approach Clinical Practice Guidelines diabetes hypertension , investigator develop training tool ( manual , website , CD-ROMs ) allow maximal uptake propose strategy . AN OBSERVATIONAL SUBSTUDY : Novel Real-Time Measurement Physical Activity Patterns Type 2 Diabetes Hypertension Through GPS Monitoring Accelerometry In addition main clinical trial , conduct additional measurement among consent type 2 diabetes patient order examine effect walkability home neighbourhood baseline step count time different physical activity intensity ( accelerometer measurement already perform SMARTER ) . The additional measurement include wear Geographical Positioning Systems ( GPS ) device 7-day period wear pedometer conceal view window accelerometer . The GPS device collect time-stamped location information X , Y coordinate collect . These use determine time within outside neighbourhood buffer zone . For assessment neighbourhood walkability , parameter assess include population density , pedestrian-friendly design diversity destination - commonly refer urban planning literature 3D 's . The variable best capture density , design , diversity include residential density , street connectivity land use mix . Residential density define number residence per square kilometre residential land area . Street connectivity define number ≥3-way intersection per square kilometre neighbourhood , great number intersection facilitate movement origin ( e.g. , residence ) destination ( e.g. , shop park ) .Land-use mix measure number different land us locate within neighbourhood.Land use mix assess via entropy score - value zero one capture degree heterogeneity land use neighbourhood . A subcomponent land use mix may particularly important encouraging individual walk within neighbourhood easily incorporate design new neighbourhood greenspace/recreational land area . We use Geographical Information System ( GIS ) mapping ( computer-based assessment neighbourhood characteristic derive exist data source spatially reference identification , home address ) measure facets neighbourhood walkability.In brief , variable derive geocoding participant six-digit home postal code , construct 1-kilometre polygonal buffer zone around participant home address ( i.e. , geographical zone around centroid postal code area ) calculate measure interest neighbourhood use tool within GIS software package ( ArcGIS ) publically available shape file . Means standard deviation use describe number step per day occur specifically home neighbourhood ( i.e. , determine GPS ) overall . Multiple linear regression analysis use ass relationship 1 ) home neighbourhood environment number step take per day home neighbourhood 2 ) home neighbourhood environment number step take per day take location . These analysis repeat time moderate vigorous activity lieu step outcome variable . Several variable measure SMARTER consider exclusion model ( e.g. , age , sex , educational level , BMI ) . This observational substudy partly fund operating grant Heart Stroke Foundation ( Quebec ) award K. Dasgupta ( Principal Investigator ) Nancy Ross ( Co-Principal Investigator substudy ) lead Samantha Hajna , doctoral candidate student .</detailed_description>
