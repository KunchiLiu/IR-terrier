	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate Fibrinogen Concentrate ( Human ) ( FCH ) reduce amount donor blood product need complex cardiovascular surgery , safe well tolerate . Subjects study get either FCH placebo infusion surgery . This addition standard treatment , donor blood blood product . Placebo contain effective medicine . The study randomise . This mean likelihood subject get FCH placebo 50 % . To make comparison FCH placebo fair possible , study `` double blind '' . This mean neither subject study doctor know FCH placebo administer . If necessary , study doctor find treatment subject receive .</brief_summary>
