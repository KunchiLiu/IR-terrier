	<brief_title>Impact Noninvasive Targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field ( tPEMF ) Opioid Use , Pain , Joint Function Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgeons continually look mean minimize postoperative pain follow TKA order reduce eliminate need opioid pain medication . Reductions pain edema along improvement range motion encourage quicker recovery joint function normal activity . Pulsed radio frequency ( PRF ) , type electromagnetic field treatment proven effectively modulate postoperative pain edema plastic surgery . Therefore , PRF potential adjunct therapy patient recover TKA . The purpose current double-blind , randomize , sham-controlled clinical trial determine effectiveness safety Ivivi Torino II , device delivers pulse radio frequency ( PRF ) , type electromagnetic field treatment , patient recover TKA treatment severe knee OA .</detailed_description>
