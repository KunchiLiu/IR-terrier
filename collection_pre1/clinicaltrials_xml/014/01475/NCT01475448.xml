	<brief_title>Long Distance Running Training Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study investigator conduct elderly runner , main observe difference first time elderly individual present great foot abduction ( toe-out ) run young adult . This alteration observe elderly individual general walking , identify protective mechanism overload medial compartment knee joint . It also know elderly individual present different joint torque distribution lower limb walk comparison young adult . However , 's know relation movement pattern , particularly foot abduction pattern , mechanical load knee joint run elderly individual neither longitudinal effect run practice relation mechanical joint load distribution . Another unknown aspect actual effect run practice posture control elderly individual . With project , investigator want understand elderly individual change movement pattern run , determine subject alter pattern also present walk standing , determine effect run practice elderly posture control . Our hypothesis strategy great foot abduction present movement task use strategy relate integrity knee joint , even consider highly active elderly individual practice run contributes well postural control population . These finding contribute great understanding benefit practice run adaptation develop elderly runner way contribute prescription activity elderly population .</detailed_description>
