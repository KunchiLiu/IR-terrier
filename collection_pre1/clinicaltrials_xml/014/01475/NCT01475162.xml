	<brief_title>Tocilizumab Treatment Steroid Refractory Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , biopsy proven GVHD , active acute GVHD require systemic immune suppressive therapy fail respond first line therapy ( corticosteroid ± agent ) . Tocilizumab administer intravenously dose 8 mg/kg every three week . Patients documented response continue receive treatment 8 mg/kg every 3 week least two month ( day 56 ) . Patients degree response without complete resolution sign symptom acute GVHD may continue receive 8 mg/kg 3-week cycle complete response achieve lack improvement . In patient beyond day 56 whose GVHD resolve , dose Tocilizumab reduce 4 mg/kg every 3 week . Subsequent discontinuation Tocilizumab occur patient immune suppressive medication ( include extracorporeal photopheresis , ECP ) receive sub therapeutic level immunosuppression ( ie . FK level &lt; 5ng/mL ) prednisone dose &lt; 20mg/day ( equivalent ) free acute GVHD sign symptoms least one month . Patients fulfill criterion progression GVHD set immunosuppressive taper , response GVHD require initiation immune suppressive treatment GVHD Tocilizumab discontinue . Tocilizumab shall discontinue re-instituted one follow criterion meet . The patient take study drug therapy point , still follow primary secondary study endpoint . A response assessment make time therapy discontinuation subsequent define study endpoint . The patient replace study . Follow-up data require unless consent data collection withdrawn : - Additional systemic GVHD therapy add disease progression non-response - Steroid dose escalate ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day prednisone ( methylprednisolone equivalent 2 mg/kg/day ) GVHD progression response - Development toxicity require withhold study medication 14 day</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 old underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Patients require biopsy proven GVHD . Patients must active acute GVHD require systemic immune suppressive therapy fail respond first line therapy . First line therapy need minimum corticosteroid , methylprednisolone 1.6mg/kg/day prednisone 2mg/kg/day , alone combine agent . Failure GVHD therapy define flare sign symptom acute GVHD progression GVHD grade least 72 hour start therapy . No response GVHD treatment ( corticosteroid ± agent ) minimum 7 day treatment . Patient must able give informed consent . Intolerance allergy Tocilizumab Active uncontrolled infection require ongoing treatment antifungal , antibiotic antiviral drug . Relapsed/persistent malignancy require rapid immune suppression withdrawal . Liver enzymes : ALT AST &gt; 3x upper limit normal . Patients severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome judgment treat physician expect normalized bilirubin day 56 enrollment . Serum bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limit normal .</criteria>
