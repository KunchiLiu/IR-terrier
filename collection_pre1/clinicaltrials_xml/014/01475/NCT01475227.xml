	<brief_summary>The study conduct common side effect HIV drug atazanavir ( take ritonavir ) hyperbilirubinaemia . Bilirubin normal waste product body get break liver leave body gut . Atazanavir slow breakdown chemical , cause jaundice ( yellow skin ) and/or scleral icterus ( yellow eye ) . This completely harmless ; fact 1 10 UK population inherit condition cause yellow . However , patient n't like side effect common reason switch drug . A study people Gilberts syndrome ( inherited condition cause change chemical bilirubin ) show mineral supplement ( zinc sulphate ) reduce level bilirubin blood . The aim study see use zinc supplement achieve effect patient high bilirubin due atazanavir use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atazanavir/Ritonavir Zinc Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atazanavir protease inhibitor ( PI ) , like agent class , require pharmacological 'boosting ' cytochrome p450 inhibitor ritonavir . Ritonavir slow hepatic clearance PIs , increase plasma concentration allow u eof low , less frequent dos . Atazanavir , boost ritonavir , approve once-daily use , internationally preferred first-line agent ( combination backbone two nucleoside [ NRTI ] ) commonly prescribe PI UK . Once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir two NRTI effective well-tolerated therapeutic option people live HIV infection . The common adverse event associate atazanavir use unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia . This observe 40 % patient 5 % patient discontinue drug due jaundice and/or scleral icterus . Truvada fix dose combination two NRTI , tenofovir ( 245mg ) emtricitabine ( 200mg ) , administer one tablet daily . Truvada prefer NRTI backbone national international guideline first line , therefore commonly use , NRTI backbone unit . Benefits atazanavir/ritonavir compare alternative agent include daily dosing , low pill burden , low rate gastro-intestinal toxicity , importantly patient population already elevate risk cardiovascular disease , favourable lipid profile . If simple intervention could reduce incidence hyperbilirubinaemia could reduce risk treatment discontinuation/switch . The aim study explore benefit , safety , add zinc sulphate patient stable regimen Truvada , atazanavir ritonavir .</detailed_description>
