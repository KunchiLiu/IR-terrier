	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Chitosan Chewing Gum Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given public health importance increase P level general population specifically patient chronic kidney disease , great importance evaluate ability medical food K2CG reduce elevate serum P level . In patient CKD receive dialysis estimate sustain control serum P may result approximate 17 % reduction mortality . The investigator conduct previous pilot double blind randomize control study K2CG 20 mg 40 mg BID 4 week 90 patient ESRD . In initial study investigator observe statistically significant reduction either serum P salivary P active therapy compare placebo . However , clear trend towards reduction serum P see randomize phase study active gum administer twice day . During open-label period gum administer thrice-daily investigator see statistically significant reduction serum P 0.3 mg/dL . Moreover , patient CKD dialysis , investigator observe reduction mean serum P approximately 0.2 mg/dL . While statistically significant , trial power detect level change serum P underpowered so.. Differences range ( 0.2-0.4 mg/dL ) report study utilize dietary manipulation ( plant protein versus animal protein ) use Niacin felt clinically meaningful reduction . The investigator previously also conduct cross-sectional observational study evaluate salivary P level across wide spectrum eGFR . The data indicate mean salivary P uniformly increase ( 15-25 mg/dL ) relative serum P ( 2.5- 4.5 mg/dL ) approximately 5-7X high show ( group 1 = eGFR &gt; 90 , group 7= eGFR &lt; 15 ) . Importantly , salivary P similar across entire spectrum eGFR . The investigator previously conduct clinical trial evaluate several different formulation K2CG vary amount chitosan load gum base , variable weight gum base 2 different formulation gum base . In trial investigator study effect gum chew either fast fed state effect vary amount gum chew time . Results study demonstrated maximal amount P loading K2CG see 1g chew gum contain 20 mg chitosan maximal effect see 30 minute gum chew . Based data study investigator choose strength/formulation primary efficacy endpoint assessment current protocol . Similar efficacy result regard total P load per chew gum see 2.0 gram , 60 mg chitosan chew gum indication subject subjective preference formulation . As result , protocol also assess ( secondary efficacy endpoint ) reduction serum P strength/formulation open label phase subject respond primary efficacy assessment phase . This allow comparison efficacy 2 gum sizes/strengths among known 'responders ' regard serum P reduction .</detailed_description>
