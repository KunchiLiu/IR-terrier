	<detailed_description>People atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , also know eczema , experience hot , dry , scaly skin severe itching . In addition , people AD prone skin infection inflammation . Little known cause AD people AD prone infection . The purpose multi-center , clinical registry study determine genetic marker associate susceptibility AD patient infection also serve potential participant database future study . Study procedures usually complete one visit clinic ; however , participant may need return one additional visit provide blood skin swab meet sample criterion initial Screening Visit . A subset participant National Jewish Health may ask return clinic 2 additional visit approximately 7 14 day original sample collection collection skin swab assessment antimicrobial activity . All participant may also ask return Unscheduled Visit provide additional blood and/or skin swab . Atopic Dermatitis previous current Eczema Herpeticum ( ADEH+ ) , Atopic Dermatitis previous current Eczema Vaccinatum ( ADEV+ ) Methicillin-Resistant S. Aureus ( MRSA+ ) participant contact every 6 month duration study . Recruitment emphasis include Non-Hispanic Caucasian , Non-Hispanic African American , Mexican American since constitute three large racial/ethnic population accord U.S. Census Bureau 2009 data ; however , racial/ethnic group exclude .
