	<brief_title>Phase I Stereotactic Body Radiation Metastatic Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response platinum-resistant ovarian cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) use fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) 3 month therapy . II . Determine rate grade 3 great non-hematologic acute toxicity SBRT use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response SBRT use cancer antigen-125 ( CA-125 ) symptom assessment use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -Ovarian Symptom Index ( FOSI ) . II . Determine rate late non-grade 3 acute toxicity use CTCAE version 4.0 . III . Evaluate local control , progression-free survival , overall survival follow SBRT . OUTLINE : Patients undergo SBRT 5 day week approximately 1 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
