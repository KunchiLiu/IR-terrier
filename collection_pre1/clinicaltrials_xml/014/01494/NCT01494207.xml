	<detailed_description>Study Design : `` Working Wellness - WOW '' randomise control trial South African worksites 12 month follow-up . Randomisation take place company level , participate company assign either intervention control group . Study Population Recruitment The study conduct cooperation major national health insurer . Large company ( &gt; 300 employee ) client insurer , offer health wellness day August 2009 February 2010 base Cape Town Johannesburg approach participate study . Thereafter , course two month employee company invite participate wellness day ( ) company . The invitation take place part feedback session wellness day comprehensive information provide study . Employees agree participate ask sign inform consent provide email address contact detail . Participants receive small incentive start research study , upon completion . Because company host wellness day research study client major national health insurer , able access data employee volunteer screen activity . The data employee choose participate sent researcher without personal identifier , thus ensure employee confidentially . Being able describe non-responders one strength study design , insured population work , provide insight problem selection bias . Control Group The employee control group receive usual care . This comprise feedback health wellness day , refer employee physician need , encouraging increase level physical activity improve nutrition generic way . They receive general health promotion material detail risk CVD advice improve lifestyle behaviour . The participant control company also participate follow measurement 6 12 month . Intervention Group Individuals intervention group receive advice health promotion material control group . Additionally , offer individually tailor intervention consist one-on-one counsel educational material . The counselling session incorporate motivational interviewing technique , help employee identify goal strategy improve lifestyle . An intervention mapping ( IM ) approach conduct start research study 13 . This IM process inform type nature intervention , include variable optimal number face-to face contact telephone contact . Based research study Groeneveld et al . envisage approximately two face face four telephone contact require 8 . Outcome Measures Health Risk Appraisal ( HRA ) Questionnaire The HRA comprise demographic , health lifestyle factor , well question related stage change various risk behaviour . The demographic variable include age gender ; lifestyle measure include smoke status , fruit vegetable intake , habitual alcohol consumption habitual physical activity . For smoking , fruit vegetable intake habitual physical activity , participant also report readiness change improve behaviour . The question readiness change base Transtheoretical Model stag change 2 . Global Physical Activity Questionnaire Habitual physical activity measure use 'Global Physical Activity Questionnaire ' ( GPAQ ) 14 . This self administer questionnaire include question habitual level light , moderate vigorous activity . Furthermore , sub sample employee randomly select wear pedometer 4 consecutive day measure number step take per day 15 . This provide objective measure physical activity baseline , 6 12 month . Dietary Habits Habitual dietary fat intake measure use Short Fat Questionnaire 16 . In addition , participant complete food frequency questionnaire record type amount food consume average week . Presenteeism Absenteeism The Healthy Days Questionnaire devise test US Centers Disease control , use measure health-related quality life . Healthy day calculate use series 4 question , focus general perceive health , self-rated physical mental health extent physical and/or mental health may limited activity within past 30 day 17 . Absenteeism data obtain company 's Human Resource office , addition participant keep log book . Clinical Measures All screening conduct qualified , trained staff , provide health insurer form part wellness day offer corporate client . The following clinical measure perform wellness day . Cholesterol screen conduct use finger-prick capillary blood sample ( Accutrend ® GC analyser , Roche Diagnostics ) measure total serum cholesterol concentration . Blood pressure measure twice per person use automate sphygmomanometer . Employees instruct sit quietly approximately three minute measure . Standing height ( cm ) measure near 0.1 cm , use stadiometer . Body weight measure use portable calibrate scale record nearest 0.1 kg . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) calculate body mass ( kg ) divide height ( ) square ( kg/m2 ) . Process Evaluation A process evaluation conduct determine intervention implement intend . The counselor participant ' require critically appraise various component intervention grade experience . Fidelity intervention measure research team , use MITI software monitor content quality interview take place , attendance number miss re-scheduled appointment ) . Cost-effectiveness analysis The cost-effectiveness intervention programme determine societal perspective . The two main outcome change habitual physical activity level CVD risk profile determine SCORE . The intervention cost include model include cost wellness day NCD risk screening , train counsellor , employment cost counsellor , opportunity cost may lose employee 's session work hour , health promotion material , incentive , travel telephone call . Direct health care cost base health-related claim data obtain medical insurer . Indirect cost include cost sickness absenteeism cost presenteeism .

Mean , standard deviation standard error calculate continuous variable . Frequency table use determine percentage individual risk , also stag change data . Chi square analysis do compare percentage employee meet physical activity recommendation intervention . An Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) perform determine whether significant change physical activity habit nutrition intervention control group 6 12 month . Logistic regression analysis complete , adjust confounders age . For economic evaluation , cost effective ratio 's calculated dividing difference mean total cost intervention usual care group , difference mean effect ( change physical activity ) . The confidence interval ratio determine use bootstrapping technique . Furthermore , cost effective ratio graphically present cost effectiveness plane .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Employees identify 'increased ' 'high ' risk CVD eligible take part research study . Risk status determine use ( Euro ) SCORE 12 , together habitual physical activity level , Body Mass Index . SCORE incorporate age , total cholesterol , blood pressure smoking status . This score rank individual accord level risk , range low high 10year risk fatal CVD ( Appendix 1 ) . Those risk 5 % high consider eligible . Independent risk score , employee inactive ( i.e. , comply least 30 minute moderate vigorous activity least 5 day per week ) , smoke , employee overweight ( i.e. , Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) also eligible take part study . Other inclusion criterion include old 18 year contract employer end 12month measurement period Employees exclude follow reason : pregnancy , diagnosis treatment cancer , disorder make physical activity impossible . Contract worker whose employ company end 12 month follow measurement , also exclude study .</criteria>
