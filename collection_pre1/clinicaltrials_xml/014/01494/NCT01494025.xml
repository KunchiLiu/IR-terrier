	<brief_summary>Elevated fat level within skeletal muscle cell ( intramyocellular lipid ) highly correlated muscle whole-body insulin resistance , prevalent obesity . The molecular link metabolic shift drive association remain open debate , notably , reduce muscle mitochondrial fatty acid ( FA ) ß-oxidation prevalent among insulin-resistant/diabetic person . Therefore , discovery biomarkers reflective status individual 's muscle FA ß-oxidation activity capacity would tremendous prognostic diagnostic value term diabetes . Furthermore , characterization metabolite associate muscle mitochondrial fat metabolism uncover candidate signal factor tie FA ß-oxidation insulin signal . The investigator propose identify , first time , specific biomarkers muscle FA ß-oxidation use multiple metabolomic analytical platform compare metabolite profile sample derive biological system display disparate muscle fat combustion . The current experiment test whether plasma metabolite and/or metabolite signature track efficient muscular FA ß-oxidation experimentally increase obese , insulin-resistant subject via diet-exercise regimen design improve muscle fitness FA combustion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Muscle-specific Biomarkers Fatty Acid Beta-oxidation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator use several comprehensive state-of-the-art metabolite analysis platform test hypothesis specific systemic metabolite metabolite signature correlate myocellular fatty acid combustion . The investigator determine whether say metabolite fact reflect metabolic health status predict , determine whether profile alter obese subject whose insulin sensitivity muscle FA ß-oxidation improve aerobic exercise dietary intervention . Specifically , study investigate usefulness metabolomic profile reflective muscle fat combustion predict metabolic health change follow diet &amp; exercise intervention obese subject . The investigator hypothesize biomarkers reflective normal , efficient muscle ß-oxidation increase , marker indicative poor muscle fat combustion reduce , cohort sedentary obese subject undergo 4 month diet-exercise protocol increase muscle fitness improve insulin action . In anticipation 16 subject complete study , 20 obese female subject recruit Davis Sacramento area ask participate weight loss regimen involve caloric restriction ( reduction ~25 % typical caloric intake , rotate 7-day menu base nutrient composition reflective U.S. Dietary Guidelines ) regular aerobic exercise design target 10 % weight loss 4 month ( Goodpaster et al. , Diabetes 52 : 2191-97 , 2003 ) . Volunteers include study follow characteristic : age 30-50 , BMI 30-34.9 stable self-reported body weight last 6 mos. , sedentary ( participate regular exercise program , typical plan exercise ≤30 min . per week assess pre-screening telephone questionnaire ) , non-smoker , clinical sign infection ( i.e. , fever , CBC wnl ) , personal history cardiovascular disease , clinically-significant elevation blood pressure , diabetes , regular medication ( except oral contraceptive , allergy med ) drug abuse . These initial study involve woman order ( ) reduce potential sex-related metabolite variability ( b ) good match subject characteristic previous study . Each subject serve control , change metabolite profile follow intervention calculate individual . Post-absorptive insulin glucose measurement make estimate insulin sensitivity HOMA , pattern follow OGTT pre- post-treatment use assess insulin sensitivity index use method Matsuda et al . ( Matsuda &amp; DeFronzo , Diabetes Care 22:1462-70 , 1999 ) . Individual change HOMA insulin sensitivity value compare pre- post-intervention period consider indicative change insulin action . An acute exercise protocol elicit muscle work carry 20 min . increase metabolic flux FA muscle , strategy design enrich plasma muscle metabolite . Differences outcome variable test repeated-measures ANOVA determine significance fitness intervention exercise bout , intervention exercise bout interaction . Screening : After sign Consent Form , initial fast blood draw ( 20 mL ) vital sign take ensure potential subject meet clinical criterion . Height weight determine interview conduct evaluate whether meet aforementioned criterion . Body weight measure near 0.1kg subject wear light-weight surgical scrub . Height measure near 0.1cm use wall-mounted , Ayrton Stadiometer Model S100 ( Ayrton Corporation , Prior Lake , MN ) . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) calculate kg/m2 . Waist circumference measure stand position , measurement obtain midway lateral low rib margin iliac crest . The measurement take mid-exhalation , average two reading record . Hip circumference measure maximum protuberance buttock . An additional 5 mL blood drawn 2 hour subject consume drink contain 75 g dose sugar ( abbreviated oral glucose tolerance test ) order evaluate insulin sensitivity . A Baecke questionnaire use assess physical activity level use DRI calculation maintenance calorie pre-intervention lead-in . To minimize variability outcome measure may introduce menstrual cycle hormonal shift , endeavor maintain consistency evaluate subject follicular phase menstrual cycle ( estimate cycle record woman ) , preferably begin day 4 menstrual cycle . Subjects birth control medication also preferably evaluate day 4 menstrual cycle . Subjects give calendar instruction record menstrual cycle throughout study . Eligible subject ask visit WHNRC several time , follow : Test Week 1 : On day 4 menstrual cycle , subject come clinic begin Test Week 1 . Each day subject give prepared meal eat WHNRC , pack go along final preparation instruction . During test week subject receive meal snack 7 day menu prepare WHNRC Metabolic Kitchen base U.S. Dietary Guidelines prescribe maintain stable body weight . Volunteers provide daily multivitamin supplement study require refrain take personal dietary supplement vitamin study . This design ensure similar nutritional profile across subject , prior obtain biofluids metabolomic analysis minimize physiological variability . Subjects weigh daily Test week 1 2 ensure body weight maintenance diet prescription adjust necessary . During test week subject participate instruction session regard diet diet compliance provide guidance register dietitian . This instruction may do individually group set . Each individual 's diet ( base U.S. Dietary Guidelines ) exercise plan design elicit target 10 % body weight loss improve fitness 16 week intervention period . Test Week 2 : Test week 2 duplicate Test Week 1 . Subjects schedule base prediction menstrual calendar . This might mean subject continue exercise additional day order coincide menstrual day 4 diet provide test begin . The acute exercise 40-50 % Test week 1 VO2max .</detailed_description>
