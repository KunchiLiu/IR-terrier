	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immediate Versus Deferred Isoniazid Preventive Therapy Among HIV-Infected Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB disease common HIV-related opportunistic infection lead cause death among HIV-infected person low-income setting . When TB occur soon pregnancy , cause complication mother well infant TB death . Infant TB difficult diagnose , half infant TB case cause maternal TB . It show treatment active TB safe effective pregnancy IPT safe effective prevent TB infection HIV-infected adult . However , safety IPT HIV-infected pregnant woman know , especially regard combination highly active retroviral therapy ( HAART ) . This study evaluate safety immediate ( antepartum , delivery ) versus defer ( postpartum , delivery ) IPT among HIV-infected pregnant woman high TB incidence setting . HIV-infected pregnant woman randomly assign one two arm . Arm A ( immediate/antepartum INH ) receive oral INH daily study entry Week 28 antepartum . At Week 28 antepartum , Arm A receive oral placebo daily Week 40 postpartum . Arm B ( deferred/postpartum INH group ) receive oral placebo daily study entry Week 12 postpartum . At Week 12 postpartum , Arm B receive oral INH daily Week 40 postpartum . Women arm receive oral prenatal multivitamin pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) daily study entry Week 40 postpartum . Study visit woman occur screen , entry , every 4 week labor delivery , labor delivery , every 4 week delivery 48 week postpartum . Visits consist give medical history undergoing physical exam blood collection ; visit delivery visit also include obstetrical exam . Presence HIV infection document screen tuberculin skin test ( TST ) administer delivery visit Week 44 postpartum visit . Some postpartum visit include urine pregnancy test . Study visit infant occur birth several time point Week 48 . These visit include medical history , physical exam , blood collection . Plasma collect woman infant study stored future study .
