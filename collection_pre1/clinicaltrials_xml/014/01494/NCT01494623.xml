	<brief_summary>Deficits work memory ( WM ) performance significant cognitive impairment schizophrenia ( SCZ ) . It also show WM performance contingent cortex synchronization , process relies brain inhibition . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) demonstrate effective treatment patient SCZ show increase brain inhibition improve cognitive performance . In study investigator intend : - evaluate rTMS treatment WM deficits SCZ - evaluate rTMS method increase WM performance healthy individual - determine improvement WM performance relate enhanced synchronization brain network - determine whether genetic polymorphism predict cortical function treatment response - evaluate influence rTMS treatment brain structure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Working Memory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To directly investigate whether enhanced gamma synchrony mediate rTMS enhancement WM patient SCZ , healthy individual investigator propose follow study . The relationship improvement WM performance increase gamma synchrony follow rTMS DLPFC investigate . Moreover , use statistical model , investigator examine whether increase gamma synchrony mediate WM improvement patient . Therefore , study investigator hope clarify neurophysiological mechanism rTMS exerts therapeutic effect WM performance develop rTMS novel therapeutic tool enhance treatment option available one core cognitive deficit disorder . There considerable evidence support fact WM deficits schizophrenia heritable strong genetic component . This evidence emerge genetic association study , study demonstrate unaffected relative schizophrenia patient also suffer WM deficit . Therefore , treatment response rTMS may least partly contingent genetic variation within individual . In particular , GABAergic gene code GABAergic proteins largely determine cortical inhibition may play key role treatment response rTMS DLPFC . However , several gene system interact GABAergic system may also play role , would also merit investigation . Similarly brain structure may also determine treatment response . For instance , volume thickness DLPFC DLPFC relate circuitry show play role WM performance , therefore , may biomarker treatment response . Objective 1 : To improve WM patient SCZ , healthy individual use rTMS . Hypothesis 1:20 Hz rTMS DLPFC superior sham stimulation improve WM performance patient SCZ , healthy individual . Objective 2 : To evaluate high frequency rTMS result enhance gamma synchrony SCZ healthy individual . Hypothesis 2 : 20 Hz rTMS DLPRC superior sham stimulation increase gamma synchrony patient SCZ , healthy individual . Objective 3 : To determine rTMS induced increase gamma band synchrony mediate therapeutic effect rTMS WM performance patient SCZ healthy individual . Hypothesis 3 : Increased gamma band synchrony show mediate therapeutic effect rTMS WM performance SCZ healthy individual . Objective 4 : To test whether key polymorphism GABAergic system , related gene system determine γ oscillatory activity WM improvement follow rTMS . Hypothesis 4 : GABAergic gene related gene polymorphism determine variation γ oscillatory activity WM performance follow rTMS treatment . Objective 5 : To examine whether brain structure biomarker treatment response rTMS Hypothesis 5 : Increase cortical thickness DLPFC microstructural integrity cortico-cortical white matter tract connect DLPFC correlate n-back task performance rTMS treatment .</detailed_description>
