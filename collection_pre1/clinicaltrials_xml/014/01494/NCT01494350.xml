	<brief_summary>The U.S. Army recently complete Phase 3 clinical trial Tunisia . This open-label single site trial design expand safety database capture additional efficacy ( final clinical cure rate index lesion ) WR 279,396 Topical Cream Tunisian subject non-complicated , non-severe Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) . Subjects patient visit Ministry Health sponsor clinic Tunisia present least one CL lesion ulcerate amenable topical treatment . Potential trial subject consent screened eligibility include medical history , physical exam , lesion parasitology , renal liver function test . If eligible study , subject receive WR 279,396 ( 15 % paromomycin + 0.5 % gentamicin topical cream ) ( target n = 110 ) . The cream apply topically CL lesion daily 20 day investigator study nurse . If subject develop new lesion study , new lesion may also treat topical cream .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects in-clinic follow-up Days 28 +/- 2 day , 42 +/- 4 day 98 +/- 8 day assess safety cure rate . Safety variables include adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect Day 98 . For primary efficacy evaluation , index ulcerative lesion assess clinical response measurement length width area ulceration . All treat lesion also assess cure secondary efficacy endpoint ulcerated non-ulcerated lesion evaluate independently . An ulcerated lesion consider completely cured 100 % reepithelialization observe . The length width non-ulcerated lesion ( nodule , plaque ) also measure evaluated cure ( ie , absence sign active lesion ) . The primary efficacy endpoint final clinical cure rate calculate number index lesion 100 % reepithelialization Day 98 divide total number index lesion receive least one topical treatment WR 279,396 .</detailed_description>
