	<brief_summary>Air Structuring Protein ( ASP ) small protein derive fungus already widely use produce enzymes add food . ASP possibility stabilise air phase ice-cream therefore interest ASP potential ice-cream ingredient . Toxicological test also carry confirm safety material evidence genotoxicity acute toxicity observed test . As part safety evaluation new protein use food , potential allergenicity also investigate Unilever sponsor study evaluate aspect ASP . This study investigate : - Whether ASP potential elicit positive skin prick test ( SPT ) population participant prove sensitivity mould . - Whether ASP responsible positive SPT reaction , occur . - And positive SPT reaction ASP occur , whether reaction clinically relevant respect food allergy . The study divide three stage . In Stage 1 Stage 2 , SPT `` open label , '' mean participant study doctor know material test . In Stage 3 , food challenge `` crossover '' design , mean participant take one product ( ASP placebo [ food contain ASP ] ) first half study treatment second half . The order ASP placebo decide randomly , like toss coin . To make comparison ASP placebo fair possible , food challenge `` double blind . '' This mean neither participant study doctor know kind product ( ASP placebo ) participant take . This multi centre study take place UK .</brief_summary>
