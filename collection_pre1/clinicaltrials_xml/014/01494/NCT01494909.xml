	<brief_summary>Malnutrition significant problem child adult Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . An impaired intestinal digestion absorption capacity one main factor responsible malnutrition CF . This impairment start early life , lead malnutrition , muscle weakness , impair immune lung function associate poor prognosis . As low BMI body weight strongly associate morbidity mortality , reduction weight loss CF manifestation would save healthcare system substantially per year . Simple method measure digest portion utilization nutrient effectiveness pancreatic enzyme preparation medication CF available . Developing panel method accurately measure gut digestion , absorption function lead study optimize nutritional regimen pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy CF . Furthermore , provide detailed insight disease age relate mechanism gut dysfunction CF . Finally , provide require information lead implement new strategy improve gut health order enhance nutritional status , quality life survival . The hypothesis intestinal macronutrient digestion , absorption function CF quantify innovative panel method use stable isotope . With panel method , information obtain effect disease progression lipid , protein glucose digestion absorption gut function CF well diseases condition characterize compromise gut . Furthermore , optimal nutritional regimen pancreatic enzyme therapy applicable evaluated disease . In present study investigator study : 1 . Pediatric patient CF Arkansas Children 's Hospital ; 2 . Adult patient CF University Arkansas Medical Sciences . 3 . Healthy control subject . Diagnosis CF make base universal diagnostic criterion . All CF patient characterize abnormal lipid digestion base clinical laboratory ( 72 hour fat analysis fecal elastase measurement ) diagnosis , require pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy , presence unstable metabolic disease . Additional criterion CF pediatric inpatient : admit ACH treatment exacerbation CF disease , clinically stable . The CF outpatient stable outpatient pancreatic insufficiency .</brief_summary>
