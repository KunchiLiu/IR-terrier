	<brief_summary>Patients receive stem cell transplant treatment disease . As part stem cell transplant , patient give strong dos chemotherapy , kill exist stem cell . A close relative patient identify , whose stem cell perfect match patient 's , use . This type transplant call `` allogeneic '' , mean cell donor . With type donor perfect match , typically increase risk develop GvHD , longer delay recovery immune system . Seventy ninety percent people receive unchanged marrow stem cell type donor develop severe GvHD . GvHD serious sometimes fatal side-effect stem cell transplant . GvHD occur new donor cell ( graft ) recognize body tissue patient ( host ) different donor . When happen , cell graft may attack host organ , primarily skin , liver intestine , cause severe rash , diarrhea , liver disease , even death . GvHD cause type immune cell graft call T cell . While stem cell selection procedure reduce risk GvHD , also result slow recovery patient 's immune system . As immune system responsible fight infection body , long recovery time transplant mean patient may increase risk infection become life-threatening . In patient , immune system also fight leukemia cell reduce risk relapse . In study , investigator try see whether make special T cell laboratory give patient help immune system recover faster . As safety measure , want `` program '' T cell , give patient , start cause GvHD , destroy ( `` suicide gene '' ) . Investigators obtain T cell donor , culture laboratory , introduce `` suicide gene '' make cell sensitive specific drug call AP1903 . If specially modify T cell begin cause GvHD , investigator kill cell administer AP1903 patient . We encourage result previous study regard effective elimination T cell cause GvHD vitro , whilst spar sufficient number T cell fight infection potentially cancer . More specifically , T cell make carry gene call iCasp9 kill encounter drug AP1903 . To get iCasp9 gene T cell , insert use virus call retrovirus make study . The drug ( AP1903 ) use `` activate '' iCasp9 experimental drug test study normal donor bad side-effects . We hope use drug kill T cell . Other drug kill damage T cell help GvHD many study , profound reduction immune defense . However , patient develop significant GvHD , also receive standard therapy complication , addition experimental drug . The major purpose study find safe effective dose `` iCasp9 '' T cell give patient receive allogeneic stem cell transplant . Another important purpose study find whether special T cell help patient 's immune system recover faster transplant would otherwise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient well stem cell transplant , severe GvHD , s/he eligible receive special `` iCasp9 '' T cell Day 30 90 transplant . The specially select treated T cell give vein ( IV ) . This dose escalation study . This mean beginning , patient start low dose ( 1 5 different level ) T cell . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 5 dose level study . If side-effects severe , dose lower T cell injection stop . If patient develop GvHD give specially treat T cell , prescribe AP1903 , show kill cell carry iCasp9 gene . This drug give 2-hour IV infusion . We continue follow patient weekly bone marrow transplant clinic first month infusion , check side-effects treatment GvHD . The patient standard test perform patient transplant , even receive special T cell .</detailed_description>
