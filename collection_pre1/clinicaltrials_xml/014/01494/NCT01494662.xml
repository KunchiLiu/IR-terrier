	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine well neratinib work treat breast cancer spread brain . Neratinib recently discover oral drug may stop breast cancer cell grow abnormally inhibit ( block ) member family proteins include Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . In research study , investigator look see well neratinib work decrease size stabilize breast cancer spread brain . The investigator also look previous treatment affect thinking ( cognition ) much neratinib reach central nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects receive neratinib drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . This drug give orally daily basis , continuously . Each treatment cycle last 4 week time subject take neratinib every day . - Physical Exams vital sign : At start cycle , physical exam . You ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . You also neurological examination assess neurological symptom . - Scans ( Imaging test ) : We assess tumor brain MRI every 2 cycle ( 6 8 week ) every 3 cycle ( 9 12 week ) . CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform every cycle , time point brain MRI . Your research doctor may ask bone scan time point clinically indicate . - Photographs : Photographs may take tumor ass response tumor treatment . Care take ensure reveal identity . - MUGA Echo : You MUGA ECHO do every 12 week , every 3 4 treatment cycle , depend cohort . - Blood test : You blood test do begin treatment cycle check blood cell count well organ function . In addition regular blood test , collect 2-3 tablespoon blood research prior study treatment start . - Neurocognitive Function : If previously receive treatment cancer spread brain ( prior enrollment study ) , ask take battery test assess cognition ( think ) start study , 2 cycle treatment , possibly end study . With test , try good understand previous treatment ongoing treatment affect memory , attention , learn , related skill . These test administer trained research assistant may take 30-45 minute complete . - For preoperative patient : If patient planning operation remove cancer brain , surgery 7-21 day start neratinib . These test allow u measure much drug ( neratinib ) reach central nervous system help u understand well neratinib . - At surgery , part tumor cerebrospinal fluid collect test level neratinib . For cerebrospinal fluid collection , may require lumbar puncture surgery begin ( spinal tap ) neurosurgeon feel he/she collect fluid easily surgery . A lumbar puncture test often use detect tumor cell cerebrospinal fluid . In case , collect fluid test cancer cell also examine fluid neratinib concentration . This provide information much drug ( neratinib ) reach central nervous system . There separate consent form procedure give neurosurgeon ( applicable ) . This procedure do already general anesthesia surgery . If contraindication procedure wish refuse undergo procedure , may . - You also blood test day surgery test level neratinib - You resume neratinib recover surgery After final dose study drug : You follow-up visit one month come study treatment . During visit , physical examination , functional assessment , assessment toxicity current medication , neurological examination . If continue ongoing toxicity relate study treatment , continue follow toxicity resolve . In addition , collect 5-6 tablespoon blood research measure marker particular breast cancer exist . We would like keep track medical condition two year stop study treatment . If see follow-up participate center ( enrol study ) , would like follow call telephone send letter year see . We may also contact doctor every 6 month see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study . If wish contact stop study treatment , must notify research study staff withdrawal consent follow-up</detailed_description>

Patients without pathologic cytologic confirmation metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis physical exam radiologic study . Invasive primary tumor metastatic tissue confirmation HER2positive status Overexpression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) score 3+ ( &gt; 30 % invasive tumor cell ) AND/OR HER2 gene amplification ( &gt; 6 HER2 gene copy per nucleus FISH ratio [ HER2 gene copy chromosome 17 signal ] ≥ 2.0 ) Note : Patients negative equivocal overall result ( FISH ratio &lt; 2.0 ≤ 6.0 HER2 gene copy per nucleus ) IHC stain score 0 , 1+ , 2+ eligible enrollment No increase corticosteroid dose week prior baseline brain MRI Prior trastuzumab lapatinib therapy allow . There limit number previous line therapy ( include chemotherapy , trastuzumab , endocrine therapy ) No prior therapy neratinib allow At least 2 week washout period post chemotherapy , prior protocol therapy , lapatinib , target biologic therapy , radiation therapy require prior study entry No washout require hormonal therapy concurrent hormonal therapy allow patient study Patients progressive disease ( Cohort 1 ) : For cohort 1 , patient must new progressive CNS lesion , assess patient 's treating physician . In cohort 1 , patient must measurable CNS disease , define least one parenchymal brain lesion accurately measure least one dimension long dimension ≥10 mm local radiology review . Note : measurable nonCNS disease NOT require study participation It anticipate patient may multiple progressive CNS lesion , one several treat SRS surgery residual untreated lesion remain . Such patient eligible enrollment study provide least one residual ( i.e . nonSRStreated nonresected ) lesion measurable ( ≥10 mm ) . Patients prior cranial surgery eligible , provide evidence measurable residual progressive lesion , least 2 week pass since surgery . If patient surgical resection follow WBRT , must evidence progressive CNS disease completion WBRT . Patients prior WBRT and/or SRS whose prior treat lesion progress thereafter also eligible . In case , lesion treat SRS may consider target lesion unequivocal evidence , opinion treat physician , progression . Patients operable disease ( Cohort 2 ) : In cohort 2 , eligible patient include CNS disease amenable surgery ( typically &lt; 3 brain metastasis plan resection neurosurgery ) . These patient may include receive received previous treatment ( ) CNS . It anticipate patient intracranial disease amenable surgery measurable CNS disease prior study entry resection . However , eligibility requirement . Measurable disease also require continue protocol subsequent surgical resection . For patient undergo surgery , postoperative whole brain radiation therapy allow patient study ( concurrent neratinib radiation therapy study toxicity unknown ) . Patients require discontinuation neratinib radiation therapy administer . Patient Cohort 3 : In cohort 3 , eligible patient must measurable Central Nervous System disease . Cohort 3a participant prior lapatinib therapy . Cohort 3b prior lapatinib therapy . Not pregnant breastfeed Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy ( include investigational agent ) within 2 week prior enter study recover adequately adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier ( exclude alopecia ) .

Participants currently receive investigational agent History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition neratinib Concurrent use enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) , include phenytoin , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , fosphenytoin , phenobarbital , pentobarbital , primidone Patients receive cancerdirected concurrent therapy , concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , hormonal therapy study . Concurrent treatment bisphosphonates allow start first dose neratinib .
