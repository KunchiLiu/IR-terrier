	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adalimumab Induction Clinical Response Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) one two primary form idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Recent study show TNF- α may play major role etiopathogenesis UC , justify use anti-TNF-α therapy . Adalimumab immunoglobulin G1 specifically bind TNF-α , neutralize function ; also modulate biological response , induce regulate TNF-α . Conventional UC therapy quite commonly bring satisfactory result ; therefore , interest new treatment method grow recently . Biological therapy highly promising prospect , since enables discontinue use glucocorticosteroids immunosuppressive dose reduction , shorten hospitalization period , allow avoid surgical treatment , extend clinical response , remission period improve patient 's quality life . Thus , present study assess clinical response active ulcerative colitis adalimumab treatment .</detailed_description>
