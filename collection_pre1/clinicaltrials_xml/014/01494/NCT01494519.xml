	<brief_title>Assessment Fixation Strategies Severe Open Tibia Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe open fracture tibia ( shin ) bone difficult treat associate high rate infection complication . There controversy regard best treatment , particularly fracture large wound trauma . The two current standard treatment option place internal fixation device ( nail plate screw ) use device pin stick skin attach ring outside body ( modern ring external fixator ) . It unknown standard care treatment option result low complication rate better function leg . Our goal perform multi-center randomize controlled trial use modern ring external fixation versus internal fixation fracture stabilization severe open tibia fracture . Patients refuse randomization option participate prospective observational study treatment decide surgeon patient . Primary Aim : To compare outcomes associated modern ring external fixators versus standard internal fixation technique treat `` severe '' open tibia shaft metaphyseal fracture without bone defect size . Primary Hypothesis : Among patient open tibia shaft metaphyseal fracture ( without bone defect size ) , rate re-hospitalization major limb complication low patient treat ring fixators treat standard internal fixation . Secondary Hypotheses : Among patient open tibia shaft metaphyseal fracture ( without bone defect size ) , overall rate infection low patient treat ring fixators treat standard internal fixation . Measures fracture heal , limb function , patient report outcome ( include pain ) good good among patient treat ring fixators treat standard internal fixation . Secondary Aim # 1 : To determine percentage Gustilo IIIB open tibia shaft fracture treat successfully ( i.e . without amputation ) without soft tissue flap secondary use ring external fixators . Secondary Aim # 2 : To determine two-year treatment cost associate fixation `` severe '' open tibia shaft metaphyseal fracture ( without bone defect size ) use modern ring external fixators versus standard internal fixation technique . Secondary Aim # 3 : To determine patient report level satisfaction fixation method overall treatment compare satisfaction two treatment group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All open tibia fracture meet least one 1 follow criterion : Diaphyseal metaphyseal Type IIIB ( Gustilo IIIB Fractures open fracture require either rotational free flap coverage soft tissue defect ) . Diaphyseal metaphyseal Type IIIA extensive contamination muscle damage ( e.g . military injury IED ) preclude nail/plate placement first debridement . Diaphyseal metaphyseal Type IIIA , injury would classify IIIB , enough muscle remove , skin could close . Diaphyseal metaphyseal Type IIIA , debridement , bone gap great 1cm . Diaphyseal metaphyseal Type IIIA , fasciotomies perform impend diagnosed compartment syndrome , wound could close primarily ( i.e . need skin grafting ) . 2 . Ages 18 64 year inclusive 3 . Study fracture suitable limb salvage use either modern ring external fixator internal fixation ( internal fixation =locked intramedullary nail plate ) . Inclusion note : 1 . Patients may coexist nontibial infection , without antibiotic treatment . 2 . Patients may risk factor infection include diabetes , immunosuppression steroid medication , HIV , infection . 3 . Patients may traumatic brain injury . 4 . Patients may treat initially temporary external fixator prior randomization . 5 . Patients may treat initially outside institution prior transfer study institution , long definitive fixation perform prior entrance study . 6 . Patients bilateral injury meet inclusion criterion may include , limb rat `` severe '' treat surgeon enrol study . 7 . Fractures may gap debridement size , include gap . 1 . Patients present traumatic amputation tibia 2 . Patients already receive definitive fixation IM nail , plate ring fixator prior study enrollment 3 . Tibia already infect diagnosed surgeon currently receive treatment 4 . Patient speak neither English Spanish 5 . Patient prisoner 6 . Patient diagnose severe psychiatric condition 7 . Patient intellectually challenge without adequate family support 8 . Patient live outside catchment area 9 . Nonambulatory patient due associate complete spinal cord injury 10 . Nonambulatory injury due preexist condition . 11 . Complex pilon plateau fracture . The study tibia fracture may extension joint surface , primarily metaphyseal diaphyseal fracture ipsilateral tibial plateau pilon fracture.Contralateral tibial plateau pilon fracture allow</criteria>
