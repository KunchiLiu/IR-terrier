	<brief_summary>This double blind , fix dose , parallel group study characterize dose response ropinirole PR adjunctive therapy L-dopa patient late stage Parkinson 's disease . The primary endpoint study , mean change baseline total awake time spend `` ' endpoint use ropinirole PR pivotal study advance Parkinson 's disease patient . This study include wide range ropinirole dos ( 4-24mg ) 8mg , 12mg , 16mg per day dos power detect 1.7 hour difference total awake time spend `` '' compare placebo . The dose Ldopa remain stable study , unless subject experience tolerability issue require L-dopa dose reduction . Up three L-dopa dose reduction allow , make total reduction approximately 30 % . Keeping L-dopa dose constant possible important avoid confound efficacy data . Clinical review primary secondary endpoint perform order establish low maximally effective therapeutic dose .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( accord modify Hoehn &amp; Yahr criterion Stages IIIV ) demonstrate lack control Ldopa therapy ( e.g . end dose akinesia , simple on/off fluctuation ) . Subjects receive stable dose Ldopa least 4 week prior screen . A minimum 3 hour awake `` offtime '' diary day record baseline period . Men nonpregnant/nonbreastfeeding woman least 30 year age screening . Women childbearing potential must practice clinically accept method contraception study least one month prior randomization one month follow completion study . Acceptable contraceptive method include abstinence , oral contraception , injectable progestogen , implant levonorgestrel , estrogenic vaginal ring , percutaneous contraceptive patch , surgical sterilisation , male partner sterilization , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) plus spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Provide write informed consent study . Be willing able comply study procedure , include diary card completion followup clinic visit . Late stage advance subject demonstrate incapacitate peak dose diphasic dyskinesia stable dose Ldopa Consumption dopamine agonist , include ropinirole , within four week randomization study . Subjects severe , clinically significant condition ( ) Parkinson 's disease , opinion investigator , would render subject unsuitable study ( e.g. , psychiatric , haematological , renal , hepatic , endocrinology , neurological [ Parkinson 's disease ] , cardiovascular , active malignancy [ basal cell carcinoma ] ) . Subjects cripple degenerative arthritis physical mental condition would preclude accurate assessment efficacy safety . Subjects prior current major psychosis ( e.g. , schizophrenia psychotic depression ) e.g . score 3 4 UPDRS item 2 [ think disorder ] item 3 [ depression ] . Subjects severe clinical dementia e.g . score 3 4 UPDRS item 1 [ mentation ] . Subjects severe dizziness fainting due postural hypotension stand . Subjects personal history melanoma . Subjects clinically significant abnormality laboratory ECG test Screening . If finding outside normal range subject include , must document investigator finding clinical significance . Subjects diagnose impulse control disorder . The modified MIDI conduct screen . Subjects score positive screen must refer specialist diagnostic evaluation . Subjects active suicidal plan/intent active suicidal thought past 6 month . Subjects history suicide attempt last 2 year 1 lifetime suicide attempt . Current alcohol drug dependence . Definite suspect personal family history clinically significant adverse reaction hypersensitivity ropinirole ( drug similar chemical structure ) would preclude longterm dose ropinirole . Withdrawal , introduction , change dose hormone replacement therapy and/or drug know substantially inhibit CYP1A2 ( e.g . ciprofloxacine , fluvoxamine , cimetidine , ethinyloestradiol ) induce CYP1A2 ( e.g . tobacco , omeprazole ) within 7 day prior enrolment ( randomization ) . Subjects already chronic therapy agent may enrol dos must remain stable 7 day prior enrolment ( randomization ) end treatment period . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Use investigational drug 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior enrolment ( randomization ) end treatment period . 15 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 16 . Use investigational drug 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior enrolment ( randomization ) end treatment period .</criteria>
