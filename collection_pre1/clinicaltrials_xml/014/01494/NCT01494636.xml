	<brief_summary>This First Time Human ( FTIH ) study sodium channel inhibitor , GSK2339345 . The study split two part . Part A ass safety tolerability new drug . Part B ass safety tolerability well effect GSK2339345 induce cough .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety , Tolerability , PK PD GSK2339345 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect GSK2339345 healthy subject . GSK2339345 blocker neuronal voltage gate sodium channel development treatment chronic cough , excessive cough post-viral viral ( acute ) cough . Inhaled pan NaV inhibitor associate oropharyngeal sensation perturbation study establish potential local sensate effect GSK2339345 multiple predict inhaled therapeutic dose . This study also aim define maximum tolerate dose GSK2339345 . Part A study conduct healthy volunteer investigate safety tolerability GSK2339345 , particular examine oropharyngeal sensation perturbation . Part A open label , oral , single-dose escalating rinse , gargle spit study . Assessments sensate change include 4 point scale , assessment sensation base tongue , sensation temperature , assessment taste , water swallow test assessment potential paraesthesia . Part A also include PK assessment investigate PK profile GSK2339345 . Part B study randomise , double blind , placebo control , inhale dose escalation study two study day per dose examine possible adverse event transient mouth , throat upper airway numbness healthy volunteer . Similar assessment sensation use Part A performed . The potential systemic cardiovascular ( CV ) central nervous system ( CNS ) effect also assess . Pharmacodynamic effect GSK2339345 investigate Part B use capsaicin cough challenge . The study investigate whether GSK2339345 alter capsaicin cough threshold ( determine capsaicin concentration require induce 2 ( C2 ) 5 ( C5 ) cough ) healthy volunteer . Part B also include PK assessment investigate PK profile GSK2339345 . Placebo use control nebulised lidocaine use control blind purpose .</detailed_description>
