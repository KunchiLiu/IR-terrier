	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE It objective REMEDEE OCT study ass vascular heal deployment Abluminal Sirolimus Coated Bio-Engineered Stent ( Combo Bio-Engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent ) patient Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) single de novo native coronary artery lesion range diameter ≥2.5 mm ≤3.5 mm ≤ 20 mm length . STUDY DESIGN The REMEDEE OCT study prospective , multicenter , randomize study design enroll 60 patient ACS randomize 1:1 treated Combo stent versus commercially available everolimus elute stent ( Xience V Promus ) . Patients receive Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Quatitative Coronary Angiography ( QCA ) follow-up image 60 day post procedure . Clinical follow-up schedule 30 , 60 , 180 , 360 540 day . Furthermore , QCA OCT also perform baseline participant study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The implantation bare-metal stent ( BMS ) significantly reduce clinical angiographic restenosis compare balloon angioplasty alone PCI due eliminate elastic recoil reduce arterial remodeling . However , in-stent restenosis still occur frequently BMS implantation 20 % 40 % patient due neointimal proliferation . The development , clinical validation widespread use drug-eluting stent ( DES ) revolutionize treatment patient coronary artery disease . Large-scale , prospective , multicenter double-blind randomized trial provide strong evidence drug-eluting stent significantly reduce angiographic restenosis enhance event-free survival compare BMS implantation native coronary artery ( 3-6 ) .However , despite improve efficacy prevention restenosis target vessel failure safety concern raise DES , focus small clinically important increase stent thrombosis occur great one year index procedure . In patient receive drug-eluting stent , acute coronary syndrome identify one major risk factor stent thrombosis ( 10 ) . Therefore , concern long-term outcome safety drug-eluting stent implantation due late stent thrombosis late stent malapposition raise . Stent thrombosis , particular late stent thrombosis , relate impaired stent healing , reduce endothelial repair , i.e . reduce stent strut coverage , implantation drug-eluting stent . This result recommendation prolong 12-month double antiplatelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel drug-eluting stent implantation , however , long double antiplatelet therapy need unknown present . These observation result intense search alternative strategy promote stent heal endothelial repair , rather inhibit endothelialisation stent , common substance use prevent neointima formation . Notably , endothelial repair substantially stimulate CD34+ endothelial progenitor cell . The Combo stent therefore cover CD34+ antibody attract endothelial progenitor cell promote endothelial stent healing , abluminal side release sirolimus prevent neointima formation restenosis . Several preclinical study porcine coronary artery model show , endothelialisation stent heal accelerate Combo stent . The present study therefore design compare stent heal Combo stent everolimus-eluting stent optical coherence tomography analysis ( optical frequency domain imaging ; OFDI ) , high resolution intracoronary imaging technique allow accurate evaluation stent coverage healing , patient acute coronary syndrome . Previous study indicate , coronary stent heal DES implantation particularly impaired patient ACS , therefore patient population particular need improve `` pro-healing '' stent concept high efficacy . RATIONALE An important limitation stent elute growth-inhibiting substance , also desirable endothelial cell growth stent strut prevent , think represent major cause `` late-stent-thrombosis '' . The rationale design `` combo-stent '' therefore combine growth inhibit substance abluminal release endothelial progenitor cell attract design promote endothelial repair . In pre-clinical study , `` Combo Stent '' demonstrate significantly low neointimal hyperplasia , also show improve endothelial coverage relative commercially available DES . There also noticeably low presence inflammation foreign body reaction . OCT- Examination Vessel Healing Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) novel intravascular image modality base infrared light emission 10-20 fold high resolution ( 10-20 µM ) compare current intravascular ultrasound system , allow detailed examination stent heal . Strut coverage , strut apposition neointima quantify micron-scale level resolution 10-20 time higher conventional intravascular ultrasound . The quantification stent heal intravascular OCT analysis recently validate histology , demonstrate excellent accuracy OCT examination . Moreover , safety feasibility OCT examination multicenter study demonstrate . Newer modality OCT image acquisition , use study , report simplify technique reduce procedural time .</detailed_description>
