	<brief_summary>Computer tomography coronary angiogram ( CTCA ) emerge noninvasive alternative assess coronary artery luminal disease . Although use noninvasive CTCA detection coronary artery disease rise , current technology 64-row multidetector computer tomography ( MDCT ) subject multiple patient artifact affect image quality.To eliminate patient relate artifact advance 320-row MDCT recently develop . The investigator therefore propose newly develop 320-MDCT provide accurate noninvasive assessment severity coronary artery luminal stenosis alternative invasive coronary angiogram .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study consist prospective non-randomized observational trial team surgeon , anesthesiologist , evaluator blind CTCA result . We hypothesize preoperative use noninvasive computer tomography , 320-row MDCT , visualize degree coronary artery stenosis lead improve clinical prediction perioperative cardiac complication . The 320-row MDCT base 64-row technology significant addition large detector capable scan heart within 1 sec cardiac cycle , thereby , eliminate patient-related artifact may produce high image quality.13 , 14 The scanning time 5 second 320-row MDCT significantly reduce compare 8-10 second 64-row MDCT</detailed_description>
