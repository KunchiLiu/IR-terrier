	<brief_summary>Every five minute someone UK stroke . It main cause long-term disability among adult UK despite fall age-specific stroke incidence , grow number survivor remain dependent activity daily live . While people stroke regain walking ability , upper limb problem voluntary arm hand activity , affect third people stroke , poor prognosis . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive procedure use polarise brain region application weak direct current potential develop useful aid treatment strategy neurorehabilitation . Recent literature application tDCS people arm hand impairment stroke show promising result upper limb function measure like Jebsen-Taylor hand function test . Furthermore , recent pilot study evaluate six-week training programme combine tDCS robot-assisted hand training report significant improvement upper limb function . However , robot latter study focus single-plane distal movement long-term effect tDCS assess . Recent robotic development include robot three rotational degrees-of-freedom upper limb , effectiveness type robot combine tDCS early stroke setting unknown . Ethical Approval seek NHS NRES Committee South Central- Southampton B ( Ref : 11/SC/0345 ) conduct study .</brief_summary>
