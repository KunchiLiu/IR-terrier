	<brief_summary>The purpose study quantify variation radiation dose level across CT technologist , determine effectiveness combine radiation dose audit report educational seminar mean reduce variation level patient exposure radiation . The investigator expect radiation dose audit report educational seminar lead reduce radiation exposure patient make technologist aware risk radiation exposure CT exams identify technologist high radiation exam compare peer . The investigator expect degree technologist concern aware radiation exposure cancer risk associate adherence radiation reduction protocols subsequent level radiation patient expose receive CT examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use advance diagnostic imaging increase dramatically past decade , contribute rise medical cost also exposure ionize radiation , CT image play prominent role require relatively high dose radiation produce image compare conventional X-rays . The growth use CT imaging along advance medical image well document , take whole use service grow quicker service provide physician . Research also show great variability amount radiation exposure individual patient , even patient characteristic control . Given increase use CT image variability radiation exposure similar imaging exam , important study way standardize reduce radiation level CT imaging . Little understood role CT technologist ' attitude may influence patient radiation exposure , therefore , project also give u opportunity survey technologists determine relationship technologist attitude awareness radiation exposure patient .</detailed_description>
