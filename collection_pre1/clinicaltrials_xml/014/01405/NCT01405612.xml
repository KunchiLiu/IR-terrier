	<brief_title>Study Examine Effect Ulimorelin Pharmacokinetics Midazolam Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulimorelin first-in-class new chemical entity . It ghrelin agonist gastroprokinetic activity develop intravenous therapy use treatment gastrointestinal ( GI ) hypomotility disorder post-operative ileus ( POI ) gastroparesis . POI transient disruption co-ordinated bowel motility contribute patient morbidity , discomfort prolong recovery time . POI commonly occur abdominal surgery annually , POI main determinant length hospital stay major abdominal surgery factor patient hospital re-admissions , increase healthcare resource use cost , decrease patient satisfaction . Current strategy attenuate POI aim enhanced recovery surgery ( ERAS ) `` fast track '' . These multimodal care protocol design reduce impact external internal factor POI duration . Recently , few complication quicker return work normal activity patient ERAS programmes implement report . In spite strategy 20 % subject undergoing partial bowel resection recover GI function within 72 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
