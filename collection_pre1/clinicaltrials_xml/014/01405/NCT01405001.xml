	<detailed_description>Stabilizing trauma victim out-of-hospital set often require critical intervention definitive airway management . Prehospital airway management study U.S. demonstrate variable success endotracheal intubation paramedic , range 75-94 % recent well design study . Initial prehospital airway effort show significant improvement patient outcome endotracheal intubation perform field . Yet , recent review cite 14 study demonstrate either difference even high mortality note among patient receive prehospital endotracheal intubation paramedic . Of note , previous study perform non-combat setting involve civilian paramedic . There currently prospective study literature involve prehospital combat advance airway management . Furthermore , even clear commonly advance airway procedure perform modern battlefield . Data Vietnam show 6 % soldier kill action suffer isolated airway injury . In current Global War Terror , estimate 27 % wound occur head , neck airway structure . Military database demonstrate patient require emergency airway management reach combat support hospital constitute 5 10 % total combat casualty population , acute airway compromise significant cause preventable traumatic death modern warfare . During Operation Iraqi Freedom , approximately 10 % 3600 trauma patient reach Combat Support Hospital ( CSH ) airway compromise primary cause death . This may represent conservative estimate give clear many patient airway compromise die battlefield never transfer CSH . In today 's world , finding important civilian physician well parallel combat setting austere environment wilderness medicine , medical support law enforcement , manage mass casualty effect terrorist attack weapon mass destruction . The purpose study evaluate advance airway management performance prehospital provider Operation Iraqi Freedom . Our intention provide preliminary analysis prehospital airway management within combat setting , identify mean improve outcomes associate prehospital endotracheal intubation . Other point interest include gain insight provider risk perform incorrect intubation ; theorize endotracheal intubation could improve combat setting ; compare rate miss intubation previous study perform civilian setting . This prospective , observational study perform combat condition Operation Iraqi Freedom . This study approve U.S. Army Clinical Investigation Regulatory Office . The primary outcome independently physician verified correct placement endotracheal tube prehospital provider within combat setting .</detailed_description>
