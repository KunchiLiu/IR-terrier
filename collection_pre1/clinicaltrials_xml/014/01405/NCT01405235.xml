	<brief_summary>Current planning study involve patient recurrent , persistent , metastasized cervical cancer must take consideration 75 % patient assume already treat cisplatin conjunction radiation therapy . It seem questionable continue treat patient cisplatin cancer recur . Thus , important seek alternative active combination . The study GOG 169 179 demonstrated combination paclitaxel cisplatin superior cisplatin monotherapy respect therapeutic response progression-free survival , combination topotecan cisplatin respect therapeutic response , progression-free survival , total survival . To achieve improvement total survival answer question regard value use platinum-free combination , propose study conduct compare efficacy platinum-free combination paclitaxel topotecan combination cisplatin topotecan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This prospective , randomize , multicenter , non-blinded phase III A study . Dosages : Arm A Paclitaxel 70 mg/m2/d i.v . Days 1 , 8 , 15 combination Topotecan 1.75 mg/m2/d i.v . Days 1 , 8 , 15 , q 28 Arm B Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/d i.v . Days 1- 3 combination Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v . Day 1 , q 21 Duration Therapy : Each patient participate study maximum six cycle complete , evidence disease progression , toxicity prevents therapy . Patients continue response stable disease may continue participate study additional 3 cycle beyond original 6 cycle consent Study Director , must document CRF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm recurrent , persistent , metastasize squamous cell carcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma , adenocarcinoma cervix , curative treatment operation and/or radiation therapy possible . Patients must previously treat cisplatin context radiochemotherapy . All patient must present measurable disease . Measurable disease define minimum one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , xray , CT , MRI , ≥ 10 mm measure spiral CT . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use evaluate response accord RECIST criterion study . When biopsy perform , perform lesion . A lesion outside irradiated area ideally select `` target lesion '' patient tumor inside outside previously irradiated area . A previously irradiate lesion may consider `` target lesion '' , radiation therapy complete , lesion objectively lead diagnosis recurrence , progress specific lesion observe . Patients must display follow : Sufficient hematologic function : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 . 500/μl ; granulocyte &gt; 3,000/μl ; thrombocyte ≥ 100,000/μl . Sufficient renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl . In patient serum A prospective , randomized phase III study compare effect Paclitaxel Topotecan Cisplatin Topotecan treatment patient recurrent persistent cervical cancer Page 24 Study Protocol Version 1.1 date 09/25/2006 creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl , result 24hour creatinine clearance must yield level &gt; 50 cm3/min eligibility . Sufficient liver function : bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal , GOT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 time institutional upper limit normal . Patients must display ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Patients must recover aftereffect surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . A minimum six week must pass since last administration chemotherapy , least three week must pass since last treatment radiation alone . Patients must sign official consent document also authorize release personal health information . Patients unable give consent independently may participate study . Patients must fulfill requirement define Section 8.1 , include completion baseline quality life questionnaire , prior inclusion study . Patients must free clinically significant infection . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients bilateral hydronephrosis alleviate ureteral stent percutaneous drainage . Patients serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl &lt; 1.5 mg/dl 24hour creatinine clearance result &lt; 50 cm3/min . Patients serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl . A prospective , randomized phase III study compare effect Paclitaxel Topotecan Cisplatin Topotecan treatment patient recurrent persistent cervical cancer Study Protocol Version 1.1 date 09/25/2006 Page 25 Patients receive prior chemotherapy , unless chemotherapy administer concomitant radiation therapy . Patients pregnant lactate . Patients craniospinal metastasis . Patients concomitant malignant disease , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients previous invasive malignant disease ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) show evidence disease within last 5 year , therapy administer study contraindicate due previous treatment receive malignant disease . Patients participate another clinical study time do 30 day plan end study .</criteria>
