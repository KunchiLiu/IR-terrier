	<brief_title>Modified Adaptive Servoventilation ( ASV ) Compared Conventional ASV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adaptive servoventilation ( ASV ) type non-invasive ventilation ameliorate central sleep and/or mixed apnea periodic breathing . Previous study field show treatment periodic breathe ASV improve sleep quality quality life . In reduce central apnea , ASV reduce overall arousal index , increase overall slow wave sleep rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep oxygen , continuous positive airway pressure bi-level treatment . ASV also effectively reduce central apnea overall apnea/hypopnea index ( AHI ) patient long-term opiate , appear effectively treat Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome . It effective form non-invasive ventilation patient central and/or mixed apnea periodic breathing , well tolerate . This prospective , randomise , crossover , observational study . Subjects spend one night conventional ASV one night modify ASV full in-lab polysomnography ( PSG ) therapy night . Objective subjective parameter record analyse .</detailed_description>
