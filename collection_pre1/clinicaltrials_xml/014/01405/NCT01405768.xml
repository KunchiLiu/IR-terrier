	<brief_title>Buffered Lidocaine Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedures ( LEEPs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aim : 1 . To determine whether buffer agent use intracervical anesthetic time cervical loop excision reduce injection-related pain . ( Hypothesis : buffering significantly reduce injection-related pain . ) 2 . To determine whether component pain LEEP ( procedural pain , cramp ) reduce buffer intracervical anesthetic among woman undergo cervical loop excision . ( Hypothesis : injection pain reduce buffering , procedural pain reduce lidocaine equally arm cramp reduce either arm . ) Background : Although cervical cancer rate dramatically reduce Pap test screen eradication precursor , 100,000 U.S. woman develop premalignant cervical lesion year require treatment ( 1 ) . The cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) common therapy CIN among U.S. gynecologist . LEEP perform use one 1-2 cm electrosurgical diathermy loop excise involve at-risk cervical epithelium include underlying stroma contain gland . Destroying tissue eliminate cell infected human papillomavirus , proximate cause cervical cancer , radically reduce risk later develop cervical cancer ( 2 , 3 ) . LEEP usually perform outpatient procedure use intracervical anesthesia , commonly combine lidocaine anesthetic agent epinephrine hemostatic agent ; final hemostasis achieve use electrosurgical fulguration topical hemostatic agent ( 4 ) . Prior literature suggest pain LEEP 3 component : pain injection anesthetic combination , pain excision , cramp reflex uterine contraction ( 5 ) . While cramp controlled oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent , injection procedural pain . Most woman categorize pain LEEP 3-7 0-10 Likert scale ( 5 , 6 ) . Studies dermal ocular anesthesia bone marrow biopsy find buffer acidic local anesthetic agent reduce injection pain ( 7-14 ) , 66 % reduction pain significant result randomize trial involve 30-50 participant . However , use buffer lidocaine yet test LEEPs . The principal investigator use form anesthesia considers acceptable form therapy ; unaware evidence support superiority either arm .</detailed_description>
