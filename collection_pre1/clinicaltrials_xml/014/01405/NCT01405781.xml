	<brief_summary>The objective study twofold : First , determine whether high level pre-operative psychological distress predict bad outcome arthroscopic rotator cuff repair ; second , obtain functional outcome ( VAS pain , VAS satisfaction , VAS function , Simple Shoulder Test ( SST ) American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ( ASES ) Score ) , physically examine perform radiographic analysis patient minimum 6 month reverse total shoulder arthroplasty , total shoulder arthroplasty , arthroscopic scapulothoracic bursectomy , acromioclavicular joint reconstruction arthroscopic rotator cuff repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical outcome study perform evaluation variety shoulder pathology surgical treatment . Among disease process include glenohumeral osteoarthritis , rotator cuff arthropathy , acromioclavicular separation scapulothoracic bursitis . A variety outcomes study perform pathology although utilized several functional outcome measure . Also respect diagnosis , several specific area research regard outcome assessment investigate . Glenohumeral osteoarthritis one common shoulder pathology treat orthopedic surgeon . For endstage osteoarthritis , anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty provide excellent pain relief functional improvement . In order perform replacement , rotator cuff tendon front shoulder ( subscapularis ) need take repaired completion case . There three basic method takedown repair : tenotomy , peel-off lesser tuberosity osteotomy . The osteotomy compare clinically tenotomy find provide low rate subscapularis tear , high outcome score universal heal evaluate use ultrasound PENN shoulder score.1 Gerber et al also evaluate long-term outcome total shoulder arthroplasty less osteotomy use Constant score measure outcomes.2 Unfortunately , many outcome study evaluate total shoulder arthroplasty utilize Simple Shoulder Test American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ( ASES ) Score evaluate . Also , osteotomy perform utilizing `` fleck '' bone instead entire less tuberosity . No study date evaluate TSA osteotomy entire less tuberosity . Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty show predictable operation treatment rotator cuff arthropathy clinical improvement pain function long term . 3,4 Dislocation report 0 % 9 % reverse total shoulder arthroplasty define one top three common complication associated reverse TSA.3-10 There considerable debate regard whether subscapularis tendon need repair reverse TSA . Edwards et al report statistically significant reduction dislocation rate 9 % 0 % addition subscapularis repair.10 These result significant bias regard randomization patient . Similarly , patient non-repair group initial portion learn curve . Consequently , risk instability likely lower report series . Acromioclavicular joint separation represent one common shoulder injury account approximately 9 % shoulder girdle injuries.11 Acromioclavicular injury classify increase severity I VI base upon disruption various ligamentous muscular support include acromioclavicular ligament , coracoclavicular ligament deltotrapezial fascia.12 Recommended initial treatment grade I III injury nonoperative reasonable clinical result initial surgical stabilization recommend high grade injuries.12-15 A variety surgical stabilization technique acromioclavicular joint separation report include transfer coracoacromial ligament acromion end resect distal clavicle originally describe Weaver Dunn 1972.16 A modification Weaver-Dunn acromioclavicular reconstruction subsequently describe include coracoclavicular stabilization nonabsorbable suture.17 Despite modification , residual subluxation dislocation acromioclavicular joint identify 29 % patients.17 Consequently , alternative construct describe include anatomic reconstruction utilize tendon graft show superior biomechanical strength compare Weaver-Dunn reconstruction.18 As part surgical transition modify Weaver-Dunn reconstruction describe Weinstein et al . reconstruction use tendon graft , augmentation coracoclavicular suture fixation either allograft autograft tendon well perform coracoacromial ligament transfer described.17,19 This differs anatomic reconstruction describe Mazzocca et al. , include transfer coracoacromial ligament hamstring graft stabilization instead graft.11 Coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction tendon graft report treatment option fail Weaver-Dunn reconstructions.20,21 Possible benefit combine reconstruction include improve construct strength vascularize ligament . Drawbacks include increased surgical dissection , increase operating room time disruption coracoacromial arch . With advance arthroscopic technique , acromioclavicular reconstruction utilize tendon graft perform arthroscopically describe without addition coracoacromial ligament transfer.22 Reconstructions without coracoacromial ligament transfer may increase ease perform reconstruction small incision arthroscopic assistance . No study evaluate clinical effect add coracoacromial ligament transfer acromioclavicular joint reconstruction utilize coracoclavicular tendon graft . Scapulothoracic bursitis `` snapping scapula syndrome '' under-recognized shoulder disorder bursal sac scapula chest wall becomes irritate inflamed . The etiology overuse cause reactive bursa formation scapula thorax . If conservative measure fail initial attempt management , surgical excision inflame bursa resection superior medial angle scapula perform . The procedure perform either arthroscopically open . A two-portal three-portal technique utilize perform arthroscopically . Very limited data exists regard outcomes two-portal three-portal technique use validated patient-based outcome scores.23,24 Rotator cuff tear common shoulder pathology treat orthopedic surgeon . Healing rate rotator cuff repair vary literature le 5 % 100 % dependent tear size , age , repair construct muscle quality.25,26 A variety method use repair tendon . A recent biomechanical study show repair triple-loaded suture anchor improve initial biomechanical property compare constructs.27 No clinical data exists heal repair triple load anchor heal effect function .</detailed_description>
