	<brief_summary>Using establish model human typhoid infection , whereby healthy adult deliberately infect typhoid-causing bacteria , investigator determine effective new oral typhoid vaccine ( M01ZH09 ) prevent infection . A previously license oral typhoid vaccine ( Ty21a ) use make sure challenge model use work properly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Typhoid serious infection kill 600,000 people every year ; frequent cause fever hospital admission area disease common . As infection restrict human , possible eliminate typhoid ; good vaccine way confirm infection require order succeed . We propose use recently establish human typhoid challenge model order evaluate novel oral vaccine candidate develop new method diagnose typhoid . Although vaccine available prevent typhoid , offer little protection population typhoid predominates , especially young child . Currently , effectiveness vaccine typhoid predict , measure protection typhoid unknown . As result , implementation vaccine program disease endemic region currently require large expensive trial new population , significantly delay programmatic implementation . We use typhoid challenge model achieve goal accelerate introduction effective vaccine population high burden disease . Healthy adult vaccinate either novel oral typhoid vaccine vaccine-placebo prior infect bacteria cause typhoid . This allow u measure effectiveness vaccine identify component immune response important produce protection infection . Current method confirm typhoid infection slow insensitive , particularly endemic region cost laboratory equipment prohibitive . In project , also explore way diagnose typhoid , aim develop test quick , reliable cost-effective resource-poor setting . This would improve individual patient management , allow accurate measurement disease burden , vital improve effort vaccine programme .</detailed_description>
