	<brief_summary>Astragalus membranaceus ( AM ) use treat stroke long period , number study know AM reduce cerebral infarction area anti-oxidation . Hemorrhagic stroke induce secondary peri-blood clot edema may increase intracranial pressure exacerbate clinical symptom . Therefore , purpose present study investigate effect AM hemorrhagic stroke edema . The investigator select 80 hemorrhagic stroke patient , stroke first attack , randomly divide control experimental group , group 40 patient follow : 1 ) control group , accept AM placebo 2.8 g three time per day ( tid ) treatment continuously 14 day second day admission operation , except standard ordinary treatment ; 2 ) experimental group , accept AM 2.8 g tid treatment continuously 14 day second day admission operation , except standard ordinary treatment . Computer tomography ( CT ) examination do first day , 4th day 7th day admission , respectively . The ratio brain edema calculate CT image , inflammatory index include level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) ï¼ŒCreatine Kinase BB Isoenzyme ( CMBB ) . D-dimer venous blood also measure . In addition , score include Glasgow outcome scale ( GOS ) , Modified rankin scale ( MRS ) , Function independence measure ( FIM ) , Barthel index ( BI ) record one week , four week 12 week admission surgical operation , index clinical symptom . The index therapeutic effect AM accord above-mentioned ratio brain edema , inflammatory index clinical symptom . The investigator expect result present study may provide scientific evidence hemorrhagic stroke edema treatment AM , thus , present study may contribute use method integrate Chinese Western Medicine treatment stroke , research Chinese Medicine .</brief_summary>
