	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common sleep disorder associate excessive daytime sleepiness cardiovascular disease . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy effective standard treatment widely prescribe patient OSA . Successful CPAP treatment also show improve cognitive , cardiovascular metabolic function . Sustainable CPAP treatment would alleviate substantial cost burden health-related consequence untreated OSA . However , use CPAP patient disappointingly low limit effectiveness treatment . Early CPAP education follow show important help subject handle side-effects problem associate use CPAP . Good education program initial phase use CPAP essentially affect acceptance adherence CPAP therapy . Good CPAP adherence medically essential patient ' health also economically importance society alleviate substantial cost burden health-related consequence . To best knowledge , randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) prove long-term efficacy extended education program improve continuous positive airway pressure use treatment outcome . The primary purpose study ass long-term efficacy on-going RCT extend education program improve CPAP compliance . The investigator hypothesize application MI technique SCT-based extended education program initial phase use CPAP also would enhance CPAP adherence even one year attend education class .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Efficacy Education Programme Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disease characterize recurrent episodic collapse upper airway sleep . It affect 4-5 % middle-aged population . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) effective treatment relieve repetitive upper airway obstruction sleep , improve cognitive , cardiovascular metabolic function . However , compliance CPAP treatment less ideal limit effectiveness . Sustained CPAP treatment would alleviate substantial cost burden health-related consequence untreated OSA . Early CPAP education follow show important help subject handle side-effects problem associate use CPAP . However , current randomize controlled trial evaluate short-term efficacy 6months . Only one retrospective observational study assess long term ( 1 year ) effect education program assess patient ' re-attendance rate CPAP clinic . However , study suffers residual effect confounders . Therefore , investigator need long term assessment education program CPAP compliance base properly conduct randomize control trial . Our team develop theory-based behavioral education program improve CPAP compliance . It utilize social cognitive theory ( SCT ) motivation interview ( MI ) popularly use theory-based education strategy widely adopt show effective traditional approach health education program . However , program examine long term effect education program OSA patient . The investigator recently start RCT assess 3-month effect program . To date , investigator recruit 36 subject 5 month . The subject recruitment conservatively expect complete July 2011 . By time review process proposal complete , subject treatment 1 year . Hence , timely u catch group subject assess long-term effect education program . In additional , team highly experienced management OSA patient . The investigator recently demonstrate use CPAP improvement cardiovascular metabolic function . Currently , investigator conduct randomize control trial `` Education CPAP '' ( IRB . UW10-177 ) ( NCT01173406 ) , assess short-term ( 3-months ) efficacy extended education program , use concept SCT MI . To best knowledge , randomize study investigator long-term efficacy CPAP education intervention ( either use traditional theory-based education strategy ) . This propose study assess long-term efficacy current on-going extended education program improve CPAP compliance Chinese subject OSA .</detailed_description>
