	<brief_summary>The purpose study find darbepoetin alfa child less 1 year age anemia ( decrease red blood cell ) due kidney failure . This study see darbepoetin alfa safe well tolerate whether cause side effect take blood sample check vital sign ( heart rate , body temperature , blood pressure test ) specific time throughout study . In addition , study evaluate amount darbepoetin alfa blood time look special marker blood evaluate darbepoetin alfa work anemia . Darbepoetin alfa approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) use adult , age pediatric subject .
