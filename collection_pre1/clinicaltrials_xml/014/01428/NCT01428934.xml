	<detailed_description>Primary prevention cardiovascular disease priority public health policy develop develop country . The fundamental strategy consist identify people high risk situation preventive measure effective efficient . However , specificity sensitivity risk equation modest , mean approximately 50 % patient likely develop vascular event would benefit preventive measure consider high risk . While 30 % subject consider risk n't really benefit preventive measure . Moreover , decision imply thousand people determine drug treatment indication take every day primary care center . These decision base mostly result estimation probability develop vascular disease 10 year . Improvement prediction country immediate , clinical welfare impact short term public health effect . The purpose study analyze ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) , measure arterial stiffness , postprandial glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , self-measured blood pressure presence comorbidity independently associate incidence vascular event whether improve predictive capacity current risk equation intermediate-risk population .</detailed_description>
