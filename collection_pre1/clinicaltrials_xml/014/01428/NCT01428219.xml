	<brief_title>Trial Cabozantinib ( XL184 ) Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Metastatic Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant proportion patient prostate cancer develop metastatic disease , commonly affect skeleton . Bone metastases cause significant morbidity mortality patient , require long-term management . Study participant research study diagnosis castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic bone . Cabozantinib approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat people castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic bone type cancer . Giving cabozantinib human cancer patient experimental . Cabozantinib currently give patient study . Cabozantinib known anti-tumor effect reduce bone metastasis base early clinical study prostate cancer cancer . The drug know side effect . The common side effect fatigue , diarrhea , anorexia , rash , palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( PPE ) syndrome . To date , know cabozantinib safe and/or effective .</detailed_description>
