	<brief_title>Ph 1b Study Evaluate GSK2110183 Combination With Bortezomib Dexamethasone Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase Ib , open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) clinical activity GSK2110183 dose combination bortezomib dexamethasone relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) subject fail least one line systemic treatment . Part 1 identify maximum tolerate dose ( ) ( MTD ) combination regimen . Part 1 , Schedule A ass safety pharmacodynamics GSK2110183 administer daily bortezomib ( 1.3 mg/m2 ) dexamethasone ( 20 mg ) give biweekly . It estimate 35-45 evaluable subject enrol Part 1 . Part 2 explore safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics clinical activity MTD ( ) identify Part 1 . A minimum 15 maximum 40 subject enroll Part 2 Safety/Clinical Activity Cohort Schedule explore . The Part 2 PK/PD cohort enroll 18 subject . This pharmacokinetic cohort explore whether exposure GSK2110183 MTD similar GSK2110183 administer alone combination bortezomib dexamethasone . The relationship explore bortezomib dexamethasone two drug give combination GSK2110183 . The identified MTD ( ) pharmacodynamic result study inform dos future development regimen GSK2110183 dose combination bortezomib dexamethasone subject relapsed/refractory MM .</detailed_description>
