	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis characterize brain area focal neuroinflammation . Imaging microglia activation multiple sclerosis could represent useful marker neuroinflammation . A novel PET tracer high affinity TSPO , [ 18F ] PBR111 , promise tool PET imaging activate microglia . This study aim characterize [ 18F ] PBR111 vivo marker microglial activation Multiple Sclerosis . Regional bind [ 18F ] PBR111 quantify PET brain 24 patient multiple sclerosis 24 age- gender- match healthy volunteer . A subgroup patient healthy volunteer scan twice consecutive day , test reproducibility measure . Another subgroup patient re-scanned [ 18F ] PBR111 4-6 month . MRI-based measure acquire baseline , patient later repeat PET scan , also 4-6 month . Data study inform possible implementation [ 18F ] PBR111 ligand monitor neuroinflammatory process , disease progression , response treatment MS patient .</detailed_description>
