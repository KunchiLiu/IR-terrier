	<brief_summary>Acute cellular rejection relatively common liver transplantation , typically affect graft survival , associate development chronic rejection . Acute cellular rejection diagnose liver enzymes and/or liver function test elevate compare baseline . The mean differentiate acute rejection liver pathology liver biopsy . However , even invasive diagnostic procedure , may difficult distinguish acute rejection another disease process , injury cause hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) native liver . This study evaluate whether certain pattern biomarkers peripheral blood and/or liver tissue liver transplant recipient use determine transplant liver reject recipient sustain HCV injury . Diagnostic biomarkers specific acute rejection informative severity HCV recurrence could allow modulation immunosuppression therapy treat clinical condition without need invasive liver biopsy .</brief_summary>
