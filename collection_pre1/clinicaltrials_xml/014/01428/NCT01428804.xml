	<brief_title>Study Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) add-on Treatment Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate effect tDCS apply anodic left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) patient resistant depression compare patient treat conventional therapy . The tDCS use add-on drug treatment antidepressant reference resistant depression . This randomized 2-arm parallel , double blind study compare 2 group 12 patient : patient treat sham tDCS whose medication reference stabilize month vs. patient treat active tDCS 10 session five day whose medication reference stabilize month . The 24 patient resistant depression select psychiatric department University Hospital Besançon . After give informed consent , patient evaluate psychiatrist use Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . The complete assessment take 40 minute . After locate leave DLPFC , treatment active tDCS current 2 mA sham direct 20-minute session . A psychometric assessment conduct end treatment week one month , three month finally six month stop treatment . Scales comfort acceptability also propose patient determine whether gene cause treatment . This study include two parallel arm : - group name G1 treat medication escitalopram ( Seroplex® ) stabilize least 1 month 10 session tDCS anode active 2 session per day ( 1 morning 1 afternoon ) 5 day electric current 2 mA ; - group name G2 treat medication escitalopram ( Seroplex® ) stabilize least 1 month sham tDCS . These two group match age ( +/- 5 year ) gender . The population study comprise patient age 18 unipolar depressive episode resistant episode characterize failure two antidepressant treatment depressive episode treat medication escitalopram ( Seroplex® ) ( 20 mg/day ) , since least 1 month . The delay one month minimum observe non-response . Moreover , term ethical point view , 's difficult wait 6 8 week observe non-response treatment . These people recruit voluntary basis , notification consent research center , Psychiatry Clinical Department University Hospital Besançon . This study conduct period 15 month .</detailed_description>
