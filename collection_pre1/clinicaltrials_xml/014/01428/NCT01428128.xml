	<brief_summary>Many type cancer treat chemotherapy drug and/or radiation therapy . These form treatment , however , also damage normal ( non-cancer ) cell cause variety side effect . There many side effect chemotherapy . A example : lower red blood cell count ( anemia ) lead tiredness , weakness shortness breath ; lower white cell count ( white blood cell help body fight infection ) ; low platelet count ( platelet help blood clot ) ; nausea vomiting ; diarrhea ; lip mouth sore hair loss . These side effect range mild severe . P53 protein body regulates cell cycle . If cell become damage chemotherapy radiation treatment , p53 protein become activate . This activation cause cell die involved cause side effect chemotherapy radiation therapy . Arsenic trioxide drug currently approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) treatment acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , type blood bone marrow cancer . It give I.V ( intravenous , vein ) . New preclinical study show give small normal dos treatment chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy , arsenic trioxide block activation p53 protect normal tissue treatment damage . Preclinical mean study do laboratory human . This study two purpose . The first find dose range arsenic trioxide block p53 activity . This dose determine first five subject take part study receive arsenic trioxide . The dose arsenic trioxide study 1/30 normal dose give arsenic trioxide use treat acute promyelocytic leukemia . The second see arsenic trioxide decrease side effect chemotherapy . In study , arsenic trioxide investigational . `` Investigational '' mean arsenic trioxide yet approve FDA block p53 activity . This study help find small ( best ) dose give effect , good and/or bad , drug people take . The safety drug human test prior research study ; however , whether side effect still present low dose yet know .</brief_summary>
