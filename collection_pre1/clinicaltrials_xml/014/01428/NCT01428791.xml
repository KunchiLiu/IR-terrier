	<detailed_description>Chicago characterize one America 's segregated city , many neighborhood characterize black Hispanic population live concentrated pocket poverty . In addition lower socioeconomic status , neighborhood also characterize remarkable health disparity relative wealthy , predominantly white neighborhood mile away . Disparities access health service contribute poor health outcome , wholly explanatory . For cardiovascular disease , lead cause death US , black Hispanic adult elevate rate many major risk factor include physical inactivity , obesity , elevate level Fasting Blood Glucose , dyslipidemia . Blacks also elevate rate hypertension , experience well-documented excess mortality rate . Experts anticipate , give high prevalence risk factor , importantly metabolic syndrome , similar disparity cardiovascular mortality may soon emerge Hispanics well . Beyond cardiovascular disease , population face psychosocial challenge poverty , unemployment , societal racism , high rate major traumatic life stress , contribute high rate depression anxiety symptom . Even physical environment add level stress : empty building become criminal drug haven , board storefront , lack grocery provide access fresh fruit vegetable ( so-called `` food desert '' ) . Disparities access health service , environmental condition , well personal familial factor associate poverty related health disparity outcomes complex way begin understood . Linkages depression cardiovascular disease well document . These appear association , may reflect causal relationship number propose pathway , include decreased physical activity , poor dietary habit , medication non-adherence , direct impact inflammatory mediator . Aging often associate worsen health disparity . The vulnerable subpopulation among urban poor elderly , naturally vulnerable due old age , compound lifetime exposure poverty , diminished defense violence home neighborhood , include route health service provider . To date , health care intervention target specific individual risk factor elderly limit success reduce health disparity cardiovascular disease . The investigator hypothesize due two reason . First , change healthcare system need feature multidisciplinary team rather individual practitioner . Second , treatment cardiovascular risk factor require attention patient 's emotional state guard possibility provider patient work cross-purpose ; , provider want patient take action improve long-term survival , patient experience low self-esteem , hopelessness , helplessness , even passive active wish die . Reducing risk heart disease complex bio-psychosocial context require prescribe right medication recommend individual modify diet exercise . The investigator hypothesize multi-level intervention target healthcare system individual 's psychosocial behavioral risk factor may succeed past intervention fail . The investigator therefore propose test hypothesis enhance primary care delivery system intervention provide evidence-based , patient-centered mental health service target depression cardiovascular risk factor reduce risk development cardiovascular disease low-income elderly black Hispanics . Researchers Rush University Medical Center develop test several `` virtual '' interdisciplinary team intervention , healthcare provider communicate team via e-mail , telephone , fax , video conferencing . The first , Virtual Integrated Practice project demonstrate primary care practice could partner community-based team improve care older adult chronic illness . A subsequent program call BRIGHTEN ( Bridging Resources Geriatric Health Team via Electronic Networking ) enhance assessment treatment late life depression anxiety primary care . The propose `` BRIGHTEN Heart study '' determine virtual interdisciplinary clinical team ( BRIGHTEN Heart ) reduce depression older ( age ≥ 65 ) minority adult comorbid depression metabolic syndrome . The overall purpose study reduce racial disparity cardiovascular morbidity mortality black Hispanic elderly effectively control behavioral psychosocial risk factor . A second , exploratory purpose study well understand impact current major stressor lifetime current traumatic stressor , may `` hide '' factor impact emotional state , individual behavior , access care , intervention adherence . It goal incorporate investigator learn impact major traumatic stressor later intervention part overall Center effort . Study Hypothesis : Compared educational group , old minority patient symptoms depression comorbid metabolic syndrome receive BRIGHTEN Heart virtual team intervention demonstrate 1 . Significant reduction symptom depression [ Primary trial outcome ] 2 . Significant reduction metabolic syndrome 3 . Improved adherence medication prescribe medical illness Primary Aim 1 . To determine whether BRIGHTEN Heart reduce depression symptom old adult metabolic syndrome Secondary Aims 2 . To determine whether BRIGHTEN Heart intervention result reduce prevalence metabolic syndrome compare control population 3 . To test mediate hypothesis BRIGHTEN Heart intervention result improvement adherence medication Exploratory Aim 4 . To explore impact trauma major life stressor result intervention</detailed_description>
