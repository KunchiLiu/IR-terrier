	<brief_title>Japanese Phase 1 Study GSK2585823</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject apply adequate amount GSK2585823 , Benzoyl peroxide 3 % , Benzoyl peroxide 5 % , placebo ( Vehicle ) negative control ( distilled water ) use Finn Chambers Scanpor ( tape patch test Finn Chamber® put Scanpor® tape advance ) upper back time simple patch test photo patch test . The empty Finn Chamber® also apply time . The position application product ( include empty Finn Chamber® ) randomize The position application subject simple patch test photo patch test . For simple patch test , dermal condition assess 48 hour removal Finn-Chambers® . After remove Finn-Chambers® , skin area gently wipe wet absorbent cotton first evaluation 30 minute . For photo patch test , two set Finn-Chambers® apply skin . Twenty-four hour single application last application repeat dosing , set Finn-Chambers® remove . The skin area gently wipe expose 6.0 J/cm2 ultraviolet A . The set Finn-Chambers® cover avoid ultraviolet A exposure serve un-irradiated control photo-allergy assess 30 minute ultraviolet A exposure . After assessment , skin area cover empty Finn-Chambers® additional 24 hour prevent exposure light . Photo-toxicity assess 24 48 hour ultraviolet A exposure . Assessment Simple Patch test 1 . The dermatologist examine plan application sit skin reaction application site , make assessment follow time point accord criterion propose patch test study group Japan . &lt; Single application phase &gt; Day 1 : application Day 3 : 30 minute removal study medication ( 48.5 hour application ) Day 4 : 24 hour removal study medication ( 72 hour application ) &lt; Repeat application phase &gt; Day 5 : application Days 6-11 : every 24 hour ( 30 minute removal ; 23.5 hour application ) . This result use safety assessment calculation irritation index . Day 12 : 30 minute removal last study medication ( 24.5 hour last application ) Day 13 : 24 hour removal last study medication ( 48 hour last application ) Day 14 : 48 hour removal last study medication ( 72 hour last application ) Assessment Criteria Proposed Patch Test Study Group Japan No visible reaction ( - ) ; 0 Minimal visible erythema ( ± ) ; 0.5 Erythema ( + ) ; 1 Erythema + edema ( ++ ) ; 2 Erythema + edema + papule + vesicle ( +++ ) ; 3 Erythema bullosum ( ++++ ) ; 4 2 . The dermatologist examine application site Day 4 single application phase Day 14 repeat application phase determine whether symptom allergic reaction . Assessment Photo Patch Test 1 . The scorer ( dermatologist ) examine plan application sit skin reaction application site , make assessment follow time point accord criterion propose patch test study group Japan Dermatology Society ] . &lt; Single application phase &gt; Day 1 : application Day 3 : 24 hour irradiation ( 48 hour application ) Day 4 : 48 hour irradiation ( 72 hour application ) &lt; Repeat application phase &gt; Day 5 : application Day 13 : 24 hour removal last study medication ( 48 hour last application ) Day 14 : 48 hour removal last study medication ( 72 hour last application ) 2 . The dermatologist examine irradiation sit 30 minute irradiation ( 24.5 hour start application ) Day 2 ( single ) determine whether photo-urticaria . 3 . 30 minute irradiation determine whether photo-urticaria . Then , 24 48 hour irradiation , skin reaction irradiation site compare correspond non-irradiation site photo patch test , use criterion show Table 1 photo-toxicity investigational product assess accord follow criterion . Assessment Criteria Photo-toxicity No reaction similar non irradiation site ; － Slightly strong non irradiation site ; ± Definitely strong non irradiation site ; + 2 rank strong non irradiation site accord criterion Japan ; ++ 3 rank strong non irradiation site accord criterion Japan ; +++</detailed_description>
