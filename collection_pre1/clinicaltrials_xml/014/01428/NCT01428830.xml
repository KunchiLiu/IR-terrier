	<brief_title>Non-inferiority Short-term Catheterization Following Fistula Repair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vaginal fistula devastate condition , affect estimate 2 million girl woman across Africa Asia . Finding way provide service efficient cost-effective manner , without compromise surgical outcome overall health patient , paramount . Shortening duration urethral catheterization follow fistula repair surgery would increase treatment capacity ( free available bed space increase availability nursing staff ) , low cost service , potentially low risk healthcare-associated infection among fistula patient . There lack empirical evidence support particular length time urethral catheterization follow fistula repair surgery . This facility-based , multi-center randomize control trial ( RCT ) test non-inferiority short-term ( 7 day ) urethral catheterization compare longer-term ( 14 day ) urethral catheterization term predict fistula repair breakdown . The primary outcome fistula repair breakdown three month follow fistula repair surgery assess urinary dye test , routine practice fistula repair service . t. Secondary outcome include repair breakdown one week follow catheter removal , intermittent catheterization due urinary retention occurrence septic febrile episode , prolong hospitalization ( define stay facility beyond one week follow initial catheter removal related adverse event ) , catheter blockage , self-reported residual incontinence . This study conduct among 507 woman simple fistula present 8 study site fistula repair surgery course 16-18 month site .</detailed_description>
