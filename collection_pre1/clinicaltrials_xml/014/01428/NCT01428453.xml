	<brief_title>A Phase 2a Study Evaluate Effect Rilapladib ( SB-659032 ) Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study subject Alzheimer 's disease evidence cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) currently treat acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AChEI ) and/or memantine . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo control , parallel group , repeat dose design , subject ( 60 randomize subject per arm ) receive oral placebo rilapladib ( 250 mg ) , daily 24 week addition stable background AD therapy consist acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AChEI ) and/or memantine . Subjects take 250mg rilapladib placebo daily period 24 week . The total duration participation subject approximately 30 week comprise approximately 4 week screen , 24 week treatment 2 week follow-up . From time randomization throughout treatment period subject attend visit 1 week , 4 week thereafter every 4 week Week 24 . A follow-up visit occur approximately 2 week final dose study medication . Cognitive assessment perform screen visit , randomization ( baseline ) visit week 12 24 treatment period . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample take via lumbar puncture baseline Week 24 biomarker analysis related Alzheimer 's disease . Blood sample collect throughout study pharmacokinetics range biomarker analysis . A range safety tolerability assessment also perform ( include vital sign , laboratory test , eye examination ECGs ) .</detailed_description>

Subject provide full write informed consent prior performance protocolspecified procedure ; subject unable provide inform consent due cognitive status , subject provide assent full write informed consent provide legally acceptable representative 8 . The subject dedicate caregiver willing supervise participation study 9 . In opinion investigator , subject ability comply study procedure ( cognitive testing ) fluent language use administration cognitive test . 1 . History and/or evidence CNS disorder could interpret cause dementia : e.g . structural developmental abnormality , epilepsy , infectious , degenerative inflammatory/demyelinating CNS condition , Parkinson 's disease frontotemporal dementia 2 . History significant psychiatric illness schizophrenia bipolar affective disorder opinion Investigator would interfere participation study ; major depressive disorder ( accord DSMIV ) past year ; current active depression require initiation treatment ( believe account substantial degree cognitive impairment ) 3 . Evidence follow disorder : current vitamin B12 deficiency , positive syphilis serology ( unless neurosyphilis rule ) active thyroid dysfunction ( particularly suggestive hypothyroidism ) , include abnormally high low serum level thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , think cause , contribute severity subject 's dementia . 4 . History alcohol substance abuse , accord DSMIV criterion , recent remote history could contribute factor dementia . 5 . History intra cerebral haemorrhage due follow cause : cerebral amyloid angiopathy , uncontrolled hypertension , cerebral arteriovenous malformation , coagulopathy , CNS vasculitis condition investigator and/or medical monitor considers relevant risk factor intracerebral haemorrhage 6 . Recent ( i.e. , &lt; 6 month Screening Visit ) cardiovascular event define : 1 . STelevation MI nonSTelevation MI , confirm cardiac enzyme elevation ECG change 2. coronary revascularization ( percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft ) 3. stroke etiology 4. resuscitate sudden death 5. prior carotid surgery stenting procedure 7 .

Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ( per Cockcroft &amp; Gault ) Screening 16 . Other clinically significant abnormality physical ( include neurological ) , laboratory ECG examination could detrimental subject opinion Investigator could compromise integrity study . 17 . Planned major surgery within study period . 18 . Use systemic steroid immunosuppressant within last 30 day prior screen . 19 . Current treatment barbiturate , MAO inhibitor , butyrophenones , phenothiazine `` conventional '' antipsychotic within 30 day 5 halflives prior Screening , whichever longer . 20 . Treatment antidepressant , ( MAO inhibitor ) , thyroid hormone , atypical antipsychotic ( e.g . risperidone ) , benzodiazepines sedative / hypnotic unless prescribe stable dose least 2 month prior Screening . Note : Benzodiazepines sedatives/hypnotics ( include antihistamine ) halflife less 6 hour take prn ( need ) basis must take within 5 half life prior cognitive testing . 21 . Current treatment know potent inhibitor CYP3A4 ( e.g . ketoconazole , rifampin , modafinil ) . 22 . Current treatment know potent Pgp inhibitor ( itraconazole , ketoconazole , cyclosporin , loperamide , diltiazem , verapamil , spironolactone , quinidine , bepridil , quinine , carvedilol ) 23 .
