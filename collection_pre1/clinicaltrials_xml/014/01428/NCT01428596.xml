	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity HIVAX HIV-1 Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos replication defective HIV-1 vaccine ( HIVAX™ ) subject receive stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml CD4 cell count &gt; 500 cells/mm3 . Following randomized placebo-controlled vaccination phase subject receive active vaccine meet eligibility undergo 12-week analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption follow reinstitution antiretroviral therapy ( continued interruption ) follow week 48 .</detailed_description>
