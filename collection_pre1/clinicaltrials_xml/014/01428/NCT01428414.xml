	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator study compare efficacy safety combine trastuzumab paclitaxel base regimen plus carboplatin epirubicin neoadjuvant therapy Chinese HER2-positive breast cancer patient . 100 patient multicenter would randomly assign two treatment arm receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow operation adjuvant treatment . The main end point study would efficacy safety two treatment arm , trend two curve anticipate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Trastuzumab Paclitaxel Based Regimens Treat HER2-positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With increased awareness development diagnosis breast cancer , breast cancer diagnose early . Amplification overexpression , , human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER2 , also know ERBB2 ) , transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase , present around 22 % early breast cancer , 35 % locally advanced metastatic tumor , 40 % inflammatory breast cancer , associate aggressive disease poor prognosis . The significant efficacy good safety profile Trastuzumab target HER 2 combination chemotherapy adjuvant treatment EBC accept . Currently Trastuzumab move Neoadjuvant treatment combine chemotherapy base many publication , among pCR accept primary endpoint evaluate efficacy neoadjuvant therapy . In investigator study , Trastuzumab concomitantly administer different chemotherapy randomization determine effect approach pathologic CR rate . 100 patient multicenter would randomly assign two treatment arm receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow operation adjuvant treatment . Pathological complete response rate ( pCR ) , disease free survival ( DFS ) , response rate ( RR ) , percentage conserve breast surgery adverse event include Serious AEs non-serious AEs would compare . The follow time patient would 3 year .</detailed_description>
