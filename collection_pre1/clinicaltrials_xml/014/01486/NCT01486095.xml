	<brief_summary>Treatment bifurcation lesion drug-eluting stent ( DES ) ( especially double stent technique use ) associate high risk stent thrombosis . Different factor may play role high risk stent thrombosis bifurcation lesion . Possible mechanisms delay endothelialisation due action drug , coat polymer , overlap stent segment , incomplete stent apposition specific sit bifurcation lesion high thrombogenicity due turbulent flow bifurcation site . In human pathological data , RUTSS ( ratio uncover total stent strut ) appear powerful predictor stent thrombosis . This prospective study ass difference stent strut coverage stent strut apposition complex bifurcation lesion treatment dedicate AXXESS Biolimus A9-eluting bifurcation stent bifurcation site additional Biomatrix Biolimus A9-eluting stent distal main vessel side branch versus treatment culotte technique use Xience Prime everolimus-eluting stent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There ongoing controversy efficacy safety different bifurcation stenting technique . Critical consideration rate restenosis side branch ostium , completeness heal site overlap stent strut , may affect risk stent thrombosis . AIMS : To compare vessel heal 9 month use OCT image two different treatment technique treat bifurcation lesion . Quantitative assessment OCT image use assess re-endothelialisation quality strut apposition vessel wall . METHODS : Patients true bifurcation lesion involvement significant side branch require stent randomly assign one two treatment strategy . Group A comprise 20 patient treated Axxess™ Drug Eluting Coronary Bifurcation Stent System ( Biosensors Europe SA ) additional Biomatrix™ Drug Eluting Coronary Stent Systems ( Biosensors Europe SA ) implant distal main branch ( MB ) side branch ( SB ) require . Group B consist 20 patient treated culotte technique use Xience Prime everolimus-eluting stent ( Abbott-Vascular , US ) . Kissing balloon dilatation use non-compliant balloon complete index procedure case . At 9 month , control angiography patient ( QCA use dedicate software ) OCT ( main vessel side branch ) perform . ENROLMENT PLAN : Start : Third quarter 2011 Enrolment period : ± 12 month Clinical follow-up : 5 year Angiographic OCT result expect third quarter 2013</detailed_description>
