	<brief_title>Observational Study Rapid Sequence Intubation ( RSI ) Drug Delivery Using Intraosseous ( IO ) Intravenous ( IV ) Access .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study evaluate intubate condition patient receive rapid sequence intubation receive paralytic drug delivery via intravenous intraosseous vascular access perspective medical professional performing rapid sequence intubation . The investigator believe medical professional find equal intubating condition intravenous intraosseous drug delivery .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Requires rapid sequence intubation Succinylcholine choose paralytic agent IV IO access establish rapid sequence intubation For IV access patient , rapid sequence intubation case next occur IV rapid sequence intubation case follow enrol IO RSI case . Vascular access IV IO establish</criteria>
