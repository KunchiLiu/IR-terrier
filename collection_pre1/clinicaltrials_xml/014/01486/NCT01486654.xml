	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death common cause disability United States . According American Stroke Association , prevalence stroke U.S. approximately 4.8 million approximately 700,000 additional stroke occur annually . Approximately 150,000 250,000 stroke survivor become severely permanently disabled year . A common neurological deficit among stroke survivor , thus substantial contributor post-stroke disability , aphasia . The loss , difficulty language extremely debilitate enormous social economic impact quality life . Presently , treatment available person aphasia speech-language rehabilitation . With rehabilitation , however , many patient achieve less satisfactory improvement speech-language function , thus leave significant disability . Enhancing stroke recovery facilitate brain plasticity direct application stimulation cerebral cortex new area investigation show promise improve language recovery stroke-induced aphasia , probably combine intense learning . There several method deliver cortical brain stimulation modulate cortical excitability , study animal model promise result , subsequently apply rehabilitation motor deficit stroke . Applications language problem stroke emerge . Nevertheless , result suggest potential role cortical stimulation adjuvant strategy aphasia rehabilitation . Of cortical stimulation method available , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) great potential clinical use view non-invasive application , ease administration relatively low cost . tDCS method deliver weak polarize electrical current cortex via two electrode place scalp . The nature effect depend polarity current . Anodal tDCS excitatory effect ; cathodal tDCS induces inhibition . This study propose evaluate safety , feasibility , effectiveness anodal cathodal tDCS study subject Broca 's aphasia stroke , deliver concurrent speech-language rehabilitation . Subjects receive speech language therapy combine either anodal , cathodal , sham stimulation apply lesioned left hemisphere . The polarity condition compare sham stimulation , determine safety , degree improvement language performance occur , degree maintain time . The protocol single-blind . Neither subject outcomes assessor know stimulation subject receive study 's conclusion ; investigator apply stimulation know .</detailed_description>
