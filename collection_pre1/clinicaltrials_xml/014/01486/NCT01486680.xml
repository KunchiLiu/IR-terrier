	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) obesity become increasingly common New Zealand ( NZ ) worldwide . Both associate risk early mortality ( death ) . Whilst weight loss surgery know effective weight loss , current research suggest may also effective resolve T2DM around 60-80 % patient , long require medication . The mechanism remain unclear . Two main type weight loss surgery perform NZ public hospital , include gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy . The gastric bypass complex procedure compare sleeve gastrectomy . Whilst appear effective weight loss ( patient lose 60 % excess weight ) , still know one good treat T2DM . This study therefore compare two surgical procedure effective treat T2DM obese patient , well compare whether difference amount weight lose , side effect quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EFFECTS OF DIABETES AND OBESITY The World Health Organization indicate 346 million people worldwide diabetes . This expect double 2005 2030 . Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) account 90 % people diabetes known result combination physical inactivity excess weight . In New Zealand ( NZ ) 200,000 people diabetes , incidence amongst Maori Pacific population three time great NZ ethnic group . Obesity also prevalent amongst population , 5 kg/m2 high BMI result 30 % high overall mortality . Over last 10 year bariatric surgery recognise effective strategy treat morbid obesity T2DM . Indeed systematic review 2004 , Buchwald et al , overall T2DM remission rate 76 % see follow bariatric surgery . In March 2011 International Diabetic Federation release position statement recognise bariatric surgery appropriate treatment option patient T2DM body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; OR = 35kg/m2 BMI 30-35kg/m2 medical treatment fail . SURGICAL PROCEDURES Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB ) : Currently commonly perform bariatric procedure worldwide . It combine restrictive malabsorptive ( duodenal bypass ) component , mean excess weight loss ( EWL ) 61.6 % T2DM remission rate 83.8 % report . Analysis series identify T2DM remission rate 1 year 88 % . Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) : A predominantly restrictive procedure ( bypass component ) , initially use staged approach biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch ( BPD-DS ) , gain increase popularity due relatively low technical complexity . In recent systematic review mean EWL &gt; 45 % ( range 6.3 - 74.6 % ) report overall T2DM remission rate 66 % , reduce 59 % study report 1 year outcomes analyse . There however lack medium long term data meta-analysis currently feasible view high heterogeneity study lack randomise controlled trial . MECHANISM OF ACTION The mechanism T2DM remission follow procedure remain unclear may relate effect reduce caloric intake gut hormone effect proximal distal intestine . Following LRYGB , improvement glycaemic control appear occur weight loss may explain exclusion duodenum / proximal jejunum reduce insulin resistance enhance hormonal response result nutrient distal small bowel . Following LSG hormonal change hindgut theory propose . In addition increase evidence change bone mineral density body composition , reduction body fat lean tissue mass , increase rest energy expenditure , may also occur follow gastric bypass restrictive surgical procedure . It unclear whether change correlate degree comorbidity resolution surgery . CONCLUSION At current time much data relate LSG base non-randomised observational study remain unclear whether promise T2DM remission rate excess weight loss report sustainable long term . In publish randomised trial , Lee et al . Taiwan , compare T2DM remission rate 1 year LSG gastric bypass BMI &lt; 35 , much high remission rate 93 % see follow gastric bypass compare 47 % follow LSG . Given potential technical benefit LSG , urgent need compare efficacy procedure commonly perform LRYGB procedure , time clinical equipoise remain , order determine optimum approach T2DM future .</detailed_description>
