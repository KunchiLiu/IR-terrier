	<brief_summary>Despite decade research , mortality acute lung injury remain high treatment option limit . Given fact , best treatment modality may prevention lethal syndrome . Historically , image play crucial role understand ALI . The appearance chest radiography one consensus criterion define ALI , commute tomography ( CT ) scan advanced understand pathoanatomy ALI . While valuable , image modality nonspecific incorporate functional cellular physiology . PET image measure concentration radioisotope body . By embed , alter molecule , natural fate tracer study PET image . Advances understand ALI include blood flow distribution , well response alveolar recruitment maneuver prone position . Not patient receive mechanical ventilation develop ALI . Inflammation lung know play key early role development progression ALI . Secondary inflammation , lung develop edema exchange oxygen well . This early inflammation part drive specific type immune cell call neutrophil . These cell seem travel become sequester lung- `` recruit '' lung inflammatory stage . When , neutrophils release inflammatory substance integral development ALI . Neutrophils use primarily glucose fuel source . The radio isotope [ 18F ] Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) glucose analog therefore take up/ingested neutrophils part normal metabolism . Because fact , positron emission tomography ( PET ) use radio isotope [ 18F ] FDG highly sensitive marker look recruitment neutrophil lung , therefore quantify degree pulmonary inflammation prior development ALI . The investigator seek examine relationship pulmonary inflammation patient risk ALI , without clinical evidence syndrome . The investigator seek enroll ten patient pilot trial .</brief_summary>
