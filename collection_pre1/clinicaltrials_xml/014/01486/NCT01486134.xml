	<brief_summary>Object study : To assess effectiveness MR temperature monitor RFA large hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ( ≥ 5 cm ) term complete tumor necrosis rate achieve term reduction number procedure require obtain complete ablation tumor . Experimental plan : This pilot study consist perform single center single procedure multipolar RF ablation MR temperature monitoring treatment three HCC diameter range 5 cm 10 cm 20 inoperable patient . The main judgement criterion study rate complete ablation one month one RFA procedure perform MR temperature monitoring . The secondary criterion , 2-years local recurrence rate ( first initial RF ablation procedure perform MR temperature image ± additional RF ablation procedure ultrasound monitor case remnant viable foci tumor ) , potential reduction number RF procedure require achieve complete necrosis complication rate RF ablation procedure perform MR temperature monitoring . In exploratory attempt , study include comparative assessment criterion historic leg patient previously treat operator center similar large tumor multipolar RFA use exclusively ultrasound monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The RF procedure result assessment : 1 . In prepare MR room , patient position MR bed put dedicate MR compatible trolley . The abdominal antenna instal . 2 . General anesthesia tracheal intubation perform . 3 . Up six RF electrode ( 6 depend size location tumor ) insert ultrasound guidance . 4 . The patient translate without direct manipulation magnet . 5 . With usual T1 T2 weight MR morphologic sequence poison electrode check necessary adjust 6 . Adjustment MR temperature imaging ( RF energy deposition ) 7 . Starting RF procedure MR temperature monitor 8 . According thermal dose map data reposition electrode complementary energy deposition necessary 9 . Hot withdrawal electrodes 10 . Immediate ( T0 ) post procedure MR assessment limit ablation zone ( T2 SPIRCHOL , Diffusion B600 , In phase , THRIVE dynamic intravenous gadolinium injection ) . After procedure patient monitor least 48 h. MR assessment treatment response perform one month procedure ( MR protocol perform T0 ) . If ablation complete follow ensure MR every three month . If ablation appear incomplete case recurrence additional RF ablation perform patient still meet criteria treatment . The eventual additional RF ablation perform ultrasound monitoring ( response additional RF ablation procedure assess MR one month ) . At end study patient complete radiological response tumor ( ) initially treat ( local distance recurrence ) never achieve , consider treatment failure . Local recurrence define reappearance viable tumor contact ablation zone tumor consider least one MR post therapeutic examination completely ablate . All adverse effect complication record report . Quantitative analysis 2D 3D parameter tumor related ablation zone observe end RF procedure temperature map use thermal dose concept ( previously extensively investigate ) usual morphologic MR imaging ( used sequence ) , procedure ( one month ) record compare . Antibioprophylaxy : prescribed patient antecedent endoscopic sphincterotomy ( accord CLIN protocol Jean Verdier Hospital ) extend patient : 1 old 75 year , 2 patient vesicular lithiasis 3 ) patient nodule previously treat embolization severe diabetes</detailed_description>
