	<brief_title>A Study Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ( HDACi ) Quisinostat ( JNJ-26481585 ) Patients With Previously Treated Stage Ib-IVa Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm ( group ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multicenter study . The study consist 3 phase include , screen phase ( within 28 day prior start study medication ) , treatment phase ( participant receive quisinostat ) follow-up phase ( 30 day last dose study medication death clinical cutoff ) . Clinical cut-off define last participant assess progressive disease die , 6 month last participant enrol , whichever occur first . However , participant still receive study treatment time clinical cut-off , participant enter long-term extension phase continue receive study medication reason discontinuation meet ( ie , disease progression , toxicity , availability effective medication participant may receive , treat physician advice ) . The long-term extension phase continue maximum 2 year beyond clinical cut-off primary analysis . Safety evaluate assessment adverse event , vital sign , physical examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory test monitor study . Any participant respond treatment end 2-year long-term extension phase able continue receive quisinostat long assess investigator meeting treatment discontinuation criterion ; time , information relate serious adverse event collect .</detailed_description>
