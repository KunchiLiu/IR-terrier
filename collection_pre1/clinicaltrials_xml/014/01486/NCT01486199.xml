	<brief_summary>The investigator develop new nuclear medicine imaging technique measure liquid absorption airway apply screen new medication develop treat cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . The investigator believe absorption small molecule radiopharmaceutical Indium 111-DTPA indicate change liquid absorption airway demonstrate whether new CF medication effective . In study investigator develop technique test involve pediatric CF patient healthy control subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Airway Liquid Absorption Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recently develop novel aerosol-based imaging technique detect change liquid absorption airway - central pathophysiological process know important cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease . This technique may provide measure disease severity indication therapeutic correction advance currently available outcome measure . It involve simultaneous delivery two radiopharmaceutical inhalation : one absorbable small-molecule ( Indium-111 label diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ; In-DTPA ) non-absorbable particle ( Technetium 99m label sulfur colloid ; Tc-SC ) . The overarch hypothesis DTPA absorption provide quantifiable , non-invasive measurement airway liquid absorption ( ) sensitive CF genotype , ( b ) uniquely identify basic disease phenotype predict disease severity , ( c ) modulate therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult healthy control arm : subject 18 year old old without diagnosis lung disease . Pediatric CF arm : subject 614 year diagnosis cystic fibrosis determine sweat test genotype subject clinically stable determined pediatrician coinvestigator subject must previously demonstrate ability perform reproducible pulmonary function test base previous clinical visit . Females group childbearing potential need negative urine pregnancy test . Adult healthy control arm : FEV1 % p &lt; 80 % predict nursing mother positive urine pregnancy test unwilling test cigarette smoker ( regular smoking within 6 month study ) . Pediatric CF arm : FEV1 % p &lt; 40 % predict nursing mother positive urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential unable unwilling comply test procedure cigarette smoker ( regular smoking within 6 month study ) . Subjects unable lie recumbent without move 80 minute image period exclude .</criteria>
