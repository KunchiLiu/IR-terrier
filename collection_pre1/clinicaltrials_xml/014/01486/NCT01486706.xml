	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome define International Continence Society pathological condition characterize irritative symptom : urinary urgency , without incontinence , urinary frequency nocturia . The syndrome often seriously compromise quality life patient . The etiology OAB consider multifactorial . Neural plasticity bladder afferent pathways one propose mechanism OAB . The detrusor muscle many year target drug treatment antimuscarinics . However , depression detrusor contractility , may result reduce ability empty bladder lead sympathetic adverse effect , limit treatment OAB . Currently focus OAB treatment change bladder structures/mechanisms , afferent nerve urothelial signal target intervention . C-fiber bladder afferent nerve may critical symptom generation pathologic state OAB fiber demonstrate remarkable plasticity . Up-regulation bladder C-fiber afferent nerve function may also play role urge incontinence , overactive bladder ( OAB ) sensory urgency . The mechanism Gabapentin 's action neuropathic pain fully elucidate appear inhibitory activity afferent C-fibers nerve activity ; moreover , several study establish safety Gabapentin treatment different condition . Due propose mechanism , investigator suggest Gabapentin may new alternative treating OAB .</brief_summary>
