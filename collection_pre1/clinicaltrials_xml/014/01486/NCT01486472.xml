	<brief_summary>S-1 effective drug gastric cancer ( GC ) palliative chemotherapy Eastern Western patient . Recently , S-1 also report effective adjuvant therapy GC patient receive D2 surgery Eastern Asian patient . Recently , development lacrimal drainage obstruction ( LDO ) cause S-1 report case small-sized study . The incidence develop LDO estimate 15~20 % patient receive S-1 therapy retrospective study . However , prospective report incidence LDO patient receive S-1 chemotherapy . Moreover , mechanism develop S-1-induced LDO systemically study . Suggested mechanism LDO involve direct secretion S-1 tear . Therefore , study initiate prospectively investigate incidence LDO GC patient receive adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy . In addition , correlation development LDO concentration S-1 ( metabolite ) tear plasma explore . These result help clinician identify patient high risk develop S-1-associated LDO .</brief_summary>
