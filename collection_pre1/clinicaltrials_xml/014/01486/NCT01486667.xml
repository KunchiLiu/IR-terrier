	<detailed_description>Research Problem : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) hypothyroidism commonly find clinical practice , share number symptom clinical feature . It show hypothyroid subject high risk develop sleep disorder breathe OSA , adequate thyroxine treatment may reduce sleep disorder breathing.. However , time-course effect treat subclinical hypothyroidism OSA patient respiratory event sleep know . Subclinical hypothyroidism associate increase risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Dyslipidemia known complication subclinical hypothyroidism ( 2 ) effect thyroxine treatment lipid profile controversial . Some report suggest high serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , healthy subject ; however , effect levothyroxine controversial . Research Significance : This project help u know treatment subclinical hypothyroidism improve symptom reduce progression OSA , may improve patient ' quality life reduce complication OSA ( hypertension , , depression , Cardiovascular diseases , etc . ) may even reduce mortality . It help u know effect subclinical hypothyroidism treatment lipid profile hs-CRP . Research Objectives : Primary objective : â€¢ Effect treatment subclinical hypothyroidism apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) score . Secondary objective : - Effect treatment subclinical hypothyroidism lipid profile patient dyslipidemia . - Effect treatment subclinical hypothyroidism hs-CRP Research Methodology : Patients subclinical hypothyroidism undergo first Polysomnography ( PSG ) ( night 0 ) laboratory investigation include lipid profile hc-CRP enrol randomly assign receive either levothyroxine replacement therapy identical placebo tablet blind manner . The start dose 25 mcg/day dose adjust every 6 week target TSH level ( 0.25 -2.5 IU/mL ) . We keep patient replacement dose duration 24 week . PSG perform twice OSA patient , 12 week ( night 1 ) 24 week ( night 2 ) . Lipid profile hs-CRP do end 24th week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients &gt; 18 year old With Subclinical hypothyroidism define serum TSH concentration 5.0 IU/mL serum FT4 level within reference range With OSA define mild OSA : AHI 5 15/h ; moderate OSA : AHI 15 30/h ; severe OSA : AHI great 30/h ( 30 ) enrol . With confirmed sustained subclinical hypothyroidism , thus exclude patient temporary condition recovery nonthyroidal illness , measurement TSH FT4 conduct within four week randomization . Current treatment Levothyroxine lipid lower medication within two month randomization . Conditions know cause dyslipidemia e.g . uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( HbA1c &gt; 9 ) , alcoholism medication use e.g . Estrogens . Glucocorticoids , Retinoids Interferons . Conditions indicate levothyroxine treatment ( 34 ) ; include TSH level 10 mU/l , clear symptom sign associate thyroid failure relate OSA . e.g . goiter . State pregnancy , Breast feed allergy levothyroxine .</criteria>
