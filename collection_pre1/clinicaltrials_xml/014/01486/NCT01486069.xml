	<brief_summary>The present study intend clarify whether positional mandibular stability patient submit orthognathic surgery . In case instability exists , need understand could relate particular type dentofacial deformity could short-term long-term influence outcome orthognathic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mandibular Stability Dentofacial Deformity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment skeletal discrepancy nowadays mainly perform combination clinical surgical procedure orthodontics intend align teeth accord respective alveolar bone surgical procedure - orthognathic surgery - realign jaw adequate position among related rest craniofacial skeleton . Orthognathic surgery develop throughout year technically well regard fixation device operate segment , provide prediction result low complication incidence . A debate point relate possible instability mandibular position reference surgical planning due articulation temporal fossa , temporomandibular joint . However , study show always mandible position obtain articulator reflect position observe subject induction general anesthesia . Since evidence indicate alteration position mandible could influence outcome orthognathic surgery relationship certain type dentofacial deformity would beneficiate specific order surgery skeletal reference ( maxilla mandible ) , present study intend clarify question .</detailed_description>
