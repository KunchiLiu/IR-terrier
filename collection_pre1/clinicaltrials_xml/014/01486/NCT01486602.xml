	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose hypofractionated radiation therapy give together chemotherapy treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Hypofractionated radiation therapy deliver high dos radiation therapy short period time may kill tumor cell few side effect . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy together chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerable radiotherapy ( RT ) dose fraction accelerate hypofractionated radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate rate radiographic response treatment . II . To estimate rate progression : local/regional/distant . III . To estimate progression-free survival . IV . To estimate overall survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study accelerate hypofractionated radiotherapy . CONCURRENT THERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo accelerate hypofractionated radiotherapy use 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily , 5 day week , approximately 4-5.5 week . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Beginning 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
