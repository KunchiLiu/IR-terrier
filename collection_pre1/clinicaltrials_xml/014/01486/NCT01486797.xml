	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy NOX A12 combination background therapy bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) chemotherapy previously treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NOX-A12 Combination With Bendamustine Rituximab Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLL cell express high level CXCR4 chemokine receptor , cause leukemia cell migration adhesion stromal cell secrete CXCR4 ligand , CXCL12 ( stromal-derived-factor 1 , SDF-1 ) . NOX A12 specific CXCL12 antagonist may improve BR therapy disrupt CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction , thereby mobilize CLL cell protective tissue microenvironments blood . Furthermore , SDF-1 inhibition may alter activation status CLL cell , thereby trigger apoptosis sensitization CLL cell towards chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
