	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common serious problem critically ill patient , know independent risk factor mortality . Renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) mainstay supportive treatment patient severe acute kidney injury . The goal RRT achieve adequate correction uremia , electrolyte abnormality , volume overload ensure good hemodynamic tolerance . The advantage continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) increase time-averaged dialysis dose , less hemodynamic instability , possibly , removal high molecular weight solute , inflammatory cytokine . Solute removal occur several different mechanism CRRT . For relatively small solute , importance diffusion convection emphasize , solute large molecular weight , importance convection adsorption emphasize . The ability specific CRRT remove certain solute determine membrane characteristic . But actual measurement middle molecule clearance large clinical trial available trial . During CRRT , blood conduct extracorporeal circuit , circuit clot major problem daily practice CRRT , increase blood loss , workload , cost . Early clotting related bioincompatibility , critical illness , vascular access , CRRT circuit , modality . Therefore , one major intervention influence circuit survival anticoagulation . However , systemic anticoagulation , usually heparin , produce hemorrhagic complication patient high risk bleeding . To minimize risk bleeding , number alternative regimen propose , however , method limitation complication . Nafamostat mesilate , serine proteinase inhibitor , inhibit various clot factor filter circuit , characterize short half life result little systemic anticoagulation effect . A recently develop CRRT AN69ST membrane® ( Gambro Inc ) coat polyethylene imine ( PEI , cationic biopolymer ) membrane surface . Once adsorbed onto membrane , heparin keep anticoagulant property . Therefore CRRT manage without systemic administration heparin . The investigator conduct multicenter prospective randomize control open-label trial compare difference circuit survival nafamostat infusion heparinized saline prim anticoagulation CRRT . The primary end-point study circuit survival , time 1st membrane exchange . The secondary end-point clearance small molecule ( urea ) middle molecule ( β2 microglobulin ) 0 , 1 , 6 , 24h , ACT ( activate coagulation time ) measurement 1hr CRRT , Hemorrhagic complication . This noninferiority trial . The aim demonstrate nafamostat infusion inferior heparinized saline priming . For purpose , least 80 subject ( total 160 ) would require group type I error rate 5 % type II error 20 % give 20 % drop-out rate study period . Block randomization use mean dedicated website . There still conflict data effective exchange time circuit membrane . Our study may help improve prognosis patient severe AKI .</brief_summary>
