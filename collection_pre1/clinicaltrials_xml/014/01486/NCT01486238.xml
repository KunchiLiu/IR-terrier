	<brief_title>Pegaptanib Retinal Edema Secondary Diabetic Vascular Disease ( Preserve ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 24 week clinical study double-masked . Subjects randomly assign 2:1 Macugen® every 4 week ( IVMac q4 arm ) Macugen® every 6 week ( IVMac q6 arm ) . If eye eligible , one eye randomize trial . Fellow eye patient two eligible eye monitor treated standard clinical care . If sufficient fellow eye treat , provide internal control group direct comparison Macugen® treat study eye versus fellow eye . Both study eye fellow eye assess fashion every time point study . Each site least one Unmasked investigator perform study injection one Masked investigator perform study evaluation assess adverse event . Roles reverse study treatment give subject begin . Patients assign IVMac q4 receive total 6 intravitreal Macugen® injection administer 4 week interval begin Day 0 end Week 20 . Patients assign IVMac q6 receive total 4 intravitreal Macugen® injection administer 6 week interval begin Day 0 end Week 18 . Each Macugen® injection administer described package insert .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must macular edema involve center macula correspond leakage fluorescein angiogram . 2 . Foveal thickness least 250 micron ( OCT center point thickness ) , standard deviation center point &lt; 10 % , OCT signal strength &gt; 5 , properly draw ILM RPE border . 3 . Best correct distance visual acuity study eye must 137 letter score 70 20 inclusive ( 20/40 20/400 Snellen equivalent ) . 4 . Clear ocular medium adequate pupillary dilatation permit good quality stereoscopic fundus photography . 5 . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) 21 mmHg less ( local antihypertensive medication duration permit ) . 6 . The treat ophthalmologist comfortable focal laser ( direct grid need ) defer least 18 week study eye , even though focal laser indicate . 7 . Type I , Type II diabetic subject , gender , age 18 year . 8 . Women must use effective contraception , postmenopausal least 12 month prior trial entry , surgically sterile . All woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test baseline negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior injection use two effective form contraception trial least 60 day follow last dose pegaptanib sodium . 9 . Ability provide write informed consent . 10 . Ability return study visit . 1 . Eyes panretinal photocoagulation need likely need within next 6 month . 2 . Eyes active PDR high risk characteristic ( HRC ) define DRS : 1 . Mild neovascularization disc ( NVD ) least 1/3 disc area show standard photograph 10A DRS . 2 . Moderate neovascularization retina elsewhere ( NVE ) least 1/2 disc area show standard photograph 7 DRS . 3 . Presence abnormality likely confound assessment visual acuity improvement eye macular edema resolve , improves , nonperfusion &gt; 1 disc area involve foveal avascular zone , epiretinal membrane associate sign contraction and/or significant opacification , presence chorioretinal atrophy involve center macula . 4 . Vitreomacular traction determine clinically and/or OCT , , investigator 's opinion , contribute macular edema ( cause associate foveal detachment ) , would preclude improvement pegaptanib sodium 5 . Any cause macular edema vitreous extension , entrapment anterior segment wound , retinal vein occlusion involve macula . 6 . Any subfoveal hard exudate , RPE atrophy ; present evidence , past documentation foveal cyst ( fundus examination , FA OCT ) . 7 . Previous treatment intravitreal corticosteroid study eye within 3 month Day 0 visit . 8 . Previous treatment intravitreal antiangiogenic drug study eye within 3 month Day 0 visit . 9 . Previous PRP laser treatment study eye within 90 day Day 0 visit . 10 . Subjects receive YAG laser peripheral retinal cryoablation laser retinopexy ( retinal tear ) , focal photocoagulation within previous 16 week .</criteria>
