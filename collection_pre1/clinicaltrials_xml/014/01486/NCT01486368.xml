	<brief_title>A Phase II Study PF-03446962 Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess efficacy ( response rate , complete partial ) PF-03446962 give IV infusion Day 1 2 week cycle ( 14 day = 1 cycle ) patient advance malignant pleural mesothelioma previously treat cytotoxic therapy . To assess toxicity , safety tolerability PF-03446962 . To assess duration response stable disease , stable disease rate , progression-free , median overall survival rate . To collect tissue blood banking correlative science evaluation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm malignant pleural mesothelioma . Patients must advance and/or metastatic disease , incurable standard therapy . All patient must tumour block primary metastatic tumour available consent release block correlative analysis . Centre/pathologist must agree submission specimen Stage I II accrual . For patient entered Stage I accrual , archival tissue available , patient must undergo biopsy prior registration . All patient enter Stage II accrual must accessible tumour lesion ( primary metastatic disease ) fresh biopsy , formalin fix paraffin embed . These patient must consent biopsy entry trial . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . At least one site disease must unidimensionally measurable follow : Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT scan ( slice thickness ≤ 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm measure short axis All radiology study must perform within 21 day prior registration ( Exception : Within 28 day negative ) . Age ≥ 18 year . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Performance Status 2 patient eligible , , opinion investigator , suitable inclusion study likely compliant study procedure ( particular recommendation supportive care dose modification ) . Previous Therapy Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : Patients eligible first line cytotoxic chemotherapy fail Patients must receive one , one , combination chemotherapy regimen advance disease , must contain platinum agent , treatment failure must document Exchange one chemotherapy agent another within combination chemotherapy regimen due toxicity ( due progressive disease ) consider new regimen follow circumstance Carboplatin substitute cisplatin due nephrotoxicity ototoxicity One agent combination regimen change due hypersensitivity occur first cycle 28 day must elapse since last chemotherapy treatment ( least 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) patient must recover toxic effect . Other AntiCancer Therapy : • Patients may receive noncytotoxic investigational therapy ; 28 day must elapse since last treatment , antiangiogenic growth factor antagonist . Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy . A minimum 28 day must elapse end radiotherapy registration onto study . Radiation must involve &lt; 30 % function bone marrow must measurable disease outside previously irradiate area ( patient whose sole site disease previously irradiate area ineligible ) unless evidence progression new lesion document , irradiated field ) . [ Exceptions may make however low dose palliative radiotherapy ] . Previous Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 28 day prior patient registration wound heal occur . Laboratory requirement must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥100 x 109/L Chemistry : Bilirubin ≤ULN AST ALT ≤2.5 x ULN Calcium ≤3 mmol /L INR ≤1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ULN Or Creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min creatinine &gt; ULN Creatinine clearance measure directly 24 hour urine sampling calculate Cockcroft Formula : Females : GFR=1.04 x ( 140age ) x weight kg serum creatinine μmol/L ; Males : GFR=1.23 x ( 140age ) x weight kg serum creatinine μmol/L Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior registration trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment , response assessment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event follow . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥5 year . Patients know brain metastasis . ( A head CT necessary rule brain metastasis , unless clinical suspicion CNS involvement ) . Patients know brain metastasis exclude trial due poor prognosis likelihood develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PF03446962 . Patients receive concurrent treatment anticancer therapy investigational anticancer agent . Patients follow cardiovascular finding exclude : QTc prolongation ( define mean QTc interval Bazetts correction equal great 470 msec ) screen ECG history familial long QT syndrome . An ECG must do within 14 day prior registration . Patients rest BP consistently high , systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ( presence absence stable dose antihypertensive medication ) poorly control hypertension , history labile hypertension poor compliance antihypertensive medication . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history even control , LVEF &gt; 50 % . History pulmonary embolism within past 12 month ; exception may make incidental pulmonary embolus find routine scanning provide within past 6 month . History cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack within 12 month prior study entry . Patients overt bleed site ( &gt; 30 ml bleeding/episode ) within 3 month study entry eligible . No clinically relevant hemoptysis ( &gt; 5 ml fresh blood ) within 4 week prior study entry permit . Patients fleck blood sputum permit . Patients require use therapeutic dos anticoagulant warfarin , heparin low molecular weight heparin ( except low dos prophylaxis ) . INR must do within 7 day prior registration . Patients bowel obstruction condition gastrointestinal tract disease would increase risk gastrointestinal perforation , include abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol include , limited : History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement ; Active uncontrolled infection ; Any medical condition might aggravate treatment ; Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . The following exclusion enrollment study : Pregnant lactate woman . ( N.B . : All woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration ) . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use two reliable form contraception study 6 month discontinue therapy . Men must surgically sterile use barrier method contraception spermicide . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately .</criteria>
