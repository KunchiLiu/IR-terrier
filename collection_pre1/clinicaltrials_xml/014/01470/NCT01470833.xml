	<brief_title>Non-operative Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture Using Dynamic Rehabilitation . Influence Early Weight-bearing Compared With Non-weight-bearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Acute achilles tendon rupture relatively frequent ( 11 37 per 100,000 ) potentially debilitate . Age distribution bimodal , maximum incidence sports-related injury around 40 year age . This follow second small increase incidence 50-60 year age due , non sports-related injury ( 1-3 ) . The disease cost million dollar treatment lose earnings . There consensus best treatment acute achilles tendon rupture . It author ' belief decision non-operative operative treatment significantly differ orthopedic surgical department individual orthopedic surgeon . Surgery traditionally consider superior conservative treatment due low risk rerupture achilles tendon ( 4 ) . Despite fact surgery significantly increase risk serious side effect deep infection ( 4 ) . The decision operative treatment base study compare surgical treatment early dynamisation non-operative treatment without dynamisation . Recent study show increase evidence non-operative treatment early dynamisation ankle give functional outcome operative treatment without significantly increase risk rerupture ( 5.6 ) . The study show overall complication rate high surgery non-operative treatment . The surgical complication include infection , nerve damage , adhesion , contracture cosmetic problem . Pajala et . al compare outcome patient suffer rerupture suffer deep wound infection . They conclude outcome rerupture without complicate infection satisfactory , whereas outcome deep wound infection devastate ( 7 ) . The risk debilitate complication thus great surgery case conservative treatment . Traditionally non-operative treatment involve non-weightbearing 6 week . This evidence base rather due tradition . Suchak et . al show early weight bear surgical treatment ASR improve health relate quality life period surgery negative effect tendon healing . ( 9 ) It well document mechanical load improve tendon healing ( 10 ) . Thus reasonable believe early loading tendon control condition affect tendon heal beneficially . Objective study Primary purpose The objective randomized study compare early weight-bearing non-weight-bearing follow non-operative treatment acutely rupture Achilles tendon . All patient treat dynamic rehabilitation DJO Walker orthosis . Functional outcome self assess use Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score ( ATRS ) biomechanically quantification stiffness achilles tendon force development concentric eccentric work . Secondary objective Rerupture , time return work , time return sport . Method subject : The survey conduct clinical randomize trial ( RCT ) . Patients allow bear weight day 1 compare patient allow bear weight first 6 week treatment . The orthosis equip pressure sensor detect patient bear weight foot . The project approve medical ethic committee . Population 30 person include group . Altogether 60 person include . Timeplan The study plan period 3 year . Recruitment patient start 1st April 2011 expect complete 2012 . The follow period 2 year . Procedures In emergency room ankle orthosis ( DJO Walker ) apply foot 30 degree plantar flexion . The orthosis wear 8 week gradually bring foot 0 degree . From day 15 dynamisation ankle joint perform . Treatment Week 1 2 3 wedge . The orthosis must wear 24 hour day . Can remove bath night . Week 3 4 2 wedge . Dynamic rehabilitation . The boot remove night . Week 5 6 1 wedge . Dynamic rehabilitation . The boot remove night . Week 7 8 No wedge . Dynamic rehabilitation . The boot remove night . The group allow early weight-bearing instructed follow : Week 1 2 Weightbearing allow pain limit . Crutches recommend . Week 3 4 Full weightbearing allow . Week 5 8 Full weightbearing allow . Crutches avoid . The group non-weightbearing instructed follow : Week 1 6 No weightbearing . Crutches obligatory . Week 7 8 Full weightbearing allow . Dynamic rehabilitation From day 15 patient group must ankle exercise . Minimum 5 time day patient must take orthosis . Sitting table leg hang freely edge series 25 active dorsal flexion passive plantar flexion exercise must make . Verification compliance All DJO walker use study equip integrated pressure sensor detects load apply boot . Rehabilitation After 8 week patient see patient clinic . They instruct rehabilitation regime physiotherapist . Rehabilitation design home exercise program emphasis movement , stability , coordination strength . Week 9 16 The patient may cycle swim . Week 16 26 Jogging soft surface . Week 26 Sports resume . We recommend badminton , tennis squash well contact sport week 40 - 52 . Week 52 No restriction</detailed_description>
