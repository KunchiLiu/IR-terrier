	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Erlotinib Operable Stage II IIIA NSCLC With EGFR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain common cause cancer-related death world . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) common type , account 85 % case . Unfortunately , majority patient NSCLC metastatic disease diagnosis . However , even patient resectable disease poor survival . The need improve survival rate patient prompt research explore role systemic therapy operable NSCLC . In 1990s , several clinical trial preoperative chemotherapy ( also know induction chemotherapy ) follow surgery radiation patient locally advance NSCLC show improvement survival . Erlotinib orally administer tyrosine kinase inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The presence somatic mutation kinase domain EGFR strongly correlate increased responsiveness EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Recently three randomize phase III trial show first-line use EGFR-TKIs patient EGFR mutant NSCLC significantly improve response rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare platinum-based chemotherapy . These finding prompt phase II trial preoperative Erlotinib patient operable stage II IIIA NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation .</detailed_description>
