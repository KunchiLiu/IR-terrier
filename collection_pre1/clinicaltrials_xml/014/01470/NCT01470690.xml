	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study HCV Protease Inhibitor Bo-cePRevir Proton Pump Inhibitor OMeprazOle ( PROMO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know drug significantly influence bioavailability drug . For example proton pump inhibitor decrease absorption protease inhibitor use HIV treatment oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor use oncology . Proton pump inhibitor increase pH stomach might therefore decrease solubility drug decrease absorption consequence . Boceprevir ( BOC ) Hepatitis C ( HCV ) NS3 serine protease inhibitor recently receive FDA approval treatment chronic HCV infection . The drug substance slightly soluble water administration food increase oral bioavailability BOC relative fast state , 40 % 60 % base AUC . Omeprazole ( OME ) frequently use proton pump inhibitor . It second prescribed drug The Netherlands , 5 million prescription year . OME metabolize CYP2C19 CYP3A4 know induce CYP1A2 inhibit CYP2C19 . BOC potent inhibitor CYP3A4/5 metabolise CYP1A2 CYP2C19 . No interaction metabolism BOC expect . However , increase OME level may expect due inhibition CYP3A4 BOC . As proton pump inhibitor widely use relevant know drug-drug interaction proton pump inhibitor BOC exists might influence bioavailability BOC . This study design determine effect multiple dose omeprazole pharmacokinetics boceprevir vice versa . Furthermore , safety steady state boceprevir combine multiple dose omeprazole evaluate .</detailed_description>
