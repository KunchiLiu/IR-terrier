	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( CRT ) intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) treat patient recurrent tumor . Radiation therapy ( RT ) use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Palliative radiation therapy may help patient recurrent tumor live comfortably .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reirradiation pulse low dose rate technique . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate dosimetric tolerance normal structure reirradiation pulse low dose rate technique . II . To determine palliative efficacy quality life patient treat protocol . III . To determine duration response time progression . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo 3-dimensional CRT IMRT daily ( QD ) , 5 day week 10-30 day . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every month 6 month every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
