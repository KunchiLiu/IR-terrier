	<brief_title>Pilot Study 1 Outpatient Control-to-Range - System Monitoring Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Automated closed-loop control ( CLC ) , know `` artificial pancreas '' ( AP ) tremendous impact health live people type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . Our inter-institutional international research team forefront CLC development since begin JDRF Artificial Pancreas initiative 2006 . Thus far , conduct three closed-loop control clinical trial ( total 60 subject T1D ) , demonstrate significantly time acceptable `` target '' blood glucose range CLC , significantly few hypoglycemic event CLC compare open loop . Our overall objective sequentially test , validate , obtain regulatory approval , deploy home , closed-loop Control-to-Range ( CTR ) system comprise two algorithmic component : Safety Supervision Module ( SSM ) automate Range Correction Module ( RCM ) . The SSM monitor safety subject 's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump ( CSII ) prevent hypoglycemia , also monitor integrity continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) data signal sensor deviation loss sensitivity . The RCM responsible optimal regulation postprandial hyperglycemic excursion correction bolus . The first phase address overall objective pilot study test ability cell-phone-based system ( 1 ) run CTR outpatient setting , ( 2 ) remotely monitor . Specifically , pilot study entail hybrid hotel/hospital design target adult T1D experience insulin pump user . Subjects spend one night local hotel , phone-based system remotely monitor adjacent hotel room validation remote system monitor successfully occur . Subjects spend follow day hospital , CTR activate , challenge meal CGM sensor replacement . Subjects spend second night hotel continue evaluation remote system monitoring , along outpatient test CTR system run phone-based system . This series admission address first major hurdle need overcome home deployment close loop CTR system : Specific Aim 1 : The phone-based CTR system remotely monitor nurses/physicians/technicians confirm appropriate functioning outside hospital setting . Specific Aim 2 : The CTR deploy outside hospital setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must age 21 ( inclusive ) 65 year old . The age 21 choose trial support US Foundation . Patient must clinically diagnose Type 1 diabetes mellitus . For individual enrol least one criterion list must meet : Criteria document hyperglycemia ( least 1 must meet ) : Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL confirm Twohour OGTT glucose ≥200 mg/dL confirm HbA1c ≥6.5 % document confirmed Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL symptoms No data diagnosis available participant convince history hyperglycemia consistent diabetes Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( 1 must meet ) : Participant require insulin diagnosis continually thereafter Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) require insulin eventually use continually Participant start insulin diagnosis continue hyperglycemic , positive islet cell antibody consistent latent autoimmune diabetes adult ( LADA ) require insulin eventually use continually Use insulin pump treat his/her diabetes least 1 year Actively use carbohydrate [ CHO ] / insulin ratio insulin bolus adjustment order keep blood glucose predefined range Patient HbA1c 6.0 % 9 % measure DCA2000 equivalent device Patient must demonstrate proper mental status cognition study Patient must willing avoid consumption acetaminophencontaining product study intervention involve DexCom use Patient must affiliate beneficiary social medical insurance Patient sign informed consent form prior study entry Diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 month prior enrollment Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 12 month prior enrollment Pregnancy , breast feeding , intention become pregnant Uncontrolled arterial hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg ) Conditions may increase risk hypoglycemia uncontrolled coronary artery disease previous year ( e.g . history myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , therapeutic coronary intervention , coronary bypass stenting procedure , stable unstable angina , episode chest pain cardiac etiology document EKG change , positive stress test catheterization coronary blockage &gt; 50 % ) , congestive heart failure , history cerebrovascular event , seizure disorder , syncope , adrenal insufficiency , neurologic disease atrial fibrillation History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans Use device may pose electromagnetic compatibility issue and/or radiofrequency interference DexCom CGM ( implantable cardioverterdefibrillator , electronic pacemaker , neurostimulator , intrathecal pump , cochlear implant ) Anticoagulant therapy aspirin Oral steroid Medical condition require use acetaminophencontaining medication withheld study admission . Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g . inpatient psychiatric treatment within 6 month prior enrollment ) Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation Known current recent alcohol drug abuse Medical condition would make operating CGM , cell phone , insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , immobility ) Any skin condition prevents sensor pump placement abdomen arm ( e.g . bad sunburn , preexist dermatitis , intertrigo , psoriasis , extensive scarring , cellulitis ) Impaired hepatic function measure alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase ≥three time upper reference limit Impaired renal function measure creatinine &gt; 1.2 time upper limit normal Uncontrolled microvascular ( diabetic ) complication ( diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy ) , history laser coagulation , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , know diabetic nephropathy ( microalbuminuria normal creatinine ) neuropathy require treatment Active gastroparesis require current medical therapy If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Uncontrolled thyroid disease Known bleeding diathesis dyscrasia Known allergy medical adhesive , component insulin pump insertion set continuous glucose monitor sensor Unwillingness withhold dietary supplement two week prior admission duration study participation . Unwillingness withhold pramlintide , liraglutide exenatide duration study intervention . Patient actively enrol another clinical trial part study within 30 day whose annual study income 4 500€ Persons deprive freedom , adult protect law vulnerable person</criteria>
