	<detailed_description>Four million Americans chronic hepatitis C ( HCV ) , 30 % HIV+ patient co-infected HCV . Until May 2011 , standard treatment HCV combination alpha interferon ( injected weekly ) ribavirin ( daily pill ) ( IFN/RBV ) 48 week order achieve sustain virologic remission ( cure ) . HCV treatment initiation low , often concern severe treatment side effect well high rate virologic failure . Among minority medically eligible HCV+ patient ( without co-morbid HIV/AIDS ) actually begin treatment IFN/RBV , side effect cause substantial attrition ( 20 % Week 12 , 40 % Week 24 ) . The common adverse event flu-like symptom , fatigue prominent . Depressed mood also common ( mostly somatic symptom ) . Two new medication , telaprevir boceprevir ( protease inhibitor ) successful treatment HCV clinical trial , approve FDA patient genotype 1 HCV , market May 2011 . One new drug add current regimen genotype 1 infection . Because drug protease inhibitor , develop rapid resistance administer alone , must add current standard care rather replace . This expect vastly increase willingness doctor recommend treatment , patient agree treatment . The investigator expect hepatologists recommend , patient agree addition one medication . However , note commonly cause fatigue n't already present HCV , peginterferon ribavirin . The major adverse event associate telaprevir rash , boceprevir , anemia . This 14-week placebo control double blind trial armodafinil patient begin HCV treatment , start armodafinil placebo 2 week prior initiation HCV treatment . Patients recruit hepatology clinic respective site . Randomization 1:1 . Placebo patient continue HCV treatment offer 14 week armodafinil start Week 12 HCV treatment armodafinil/placebo blind broken . Patients see weekly first 4 week titrate armodafinil dose manage side effect , , biweekly , telephone contact intervene week Week 12 . After , monthly telephone call Week 24 conducted patient randomize armodafinil , biweekly visit placebo patient begin armodafinil Week 12 . The primary outcome measure concern non-adherence INF/RBV treatment : 1 ) miss dos ; 2 ) dose reduction , 3 ) attrition due side effect . Secondary outcome include rating fatigue Fatigue Severity Scale , depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , quality life Endicott Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
