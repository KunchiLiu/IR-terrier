	<brief_summary>This multicenter study evaluate safety tolerability increase dos Toca 511 , retroviral replicate vector , inject resection cavity subject Grade III Grade IV Gliomas elect undergo surgical removal tumor . Approximately 6 week injection Toca 511 , subject take oral course 5-FC , antifungal antibiotic . These one week course 5-FC repeat 31 week study . In subject , Toca 511 Toca FC also evaluate either follow standard treatment glioma : lomustine , drug approve FDA treat brain tumor bevacizumab , alternative drug approve FDA treat brain tumor . After completion study , subject eligible enrollment encourage long-term continuation protocol enable additional Toca FC treatment cycle give , well permit collection long-term safety survival data .</brief_summary>
