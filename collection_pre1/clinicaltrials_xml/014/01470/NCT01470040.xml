	<brief_title>Does Discontinuation Aspirin Treatment Following Head Trauma Decrease Incidence Chronic Subdural Hematoma ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Background Chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) well-described sequelae minor head trauma elderly population . Known risk factor development condition old age , previous bleed , intracranial hypotension , anticoagulant antiaggregant therapy prior trauma [ 1-3 , 10 ] . Anti-aggregation therapy , include treatment low-dose aspirin ( LDA ) establish risk factor development CSDH . Among patient present chronic subdural hematoma , 16-76 % history antiaggregation therapy [ 6 , 9 , 13 ] , however remain unclear whether increase risk relate treatment prior trauma continue treatment LDA trauma , hematoma supposedly develop . This implication daily clinical practice . It unclear whether continued antiaggregation therapy minor head trauma increase risk development CSDH , therefore unclear whether cessation treatment minor head trauma indicate . We aim ass whether continued aspirin treatment increase risk CSDH mild head trauma patient 50 year older present negative head CT. Brief Review Literature The risk bleed complication associate LDA prophylaxis extensively report . In 2006 , McQuaide Laine [ 4 ] perform systematic review meta-analysis assess relative absolute risk clinically relevant adverse event patient treat LDA clopidogrel cardiovascular prophylaxis . They include randomize control trial compare cardiovascular outcome adverse event patient treat placebo , LDA , clopidogrel 1966-2004 analysis . The author find modest 0.3 % ( 3 patient per thousand ) increase absolute risk intracranial bleeding associate use aspirin , although CSDH wake head trauma specifically discuss . A year earlier , Serebruany et al [ 11 ] compare risk hemorrhage associate &lt; 100mg , 100-200mg , &gt; 200mg dos aspirin meta-analysis 31 study involve 192,036 patient . They report major bleed event ( intracranial bleeding ; overt bleed decrease ≥ 5g/dl hemoglobin ≥ 15 % hematocrit ) 1.5 % patient dose &lt; 100 mg , 1.5 % patient 100-200 mg , 2.3 % patient high dose . Incidence CSDH report . Aspirin associate increase risk postoperative intracranial hemorrhage [ 5 , 7 ] , CSDH [ 13 ] However spite strong evidence aspirin treatment increase risk intracranial hemorrhage , surprising dearth research guide decision continue discontinue aspirin patient sustain mild head trauma sign injury CT. Tauber et al [ 14 ] recently assess incidence secondary intracranial hemorrhage prospective study 100 mild head trauma patient 65 year old LDA prophylaxis . Primary CT scan participant reveal evidence intracranial hemorrhage . Repeat CT , perform within 12-24 hour , reveal secondary intracranial hemorrhage lead death one patient , surgical intervention one , conservative management uneventful clinical course two patient . The author recommend repeat CT 12-24 hour 48-hour in-hospital observation elderly patient LDA prophylaxis . In 2003 , Spektor et al . investigated role LDA prophylaxis evolvement acute traumatic finding mild-to-moderate head injury [ 12 ] . They evaluate 231 patient , compare aspirin treatment . Interestingly , author find significant increase frequency intracranial hemorrhage patient receive prophylactic LDA treatment , however assess incidence delay bleeding . In 1992 , Reymond et al review characteristic 39 patient develop chronic subdural hematoma population 198 patient admit severe head trauma various form intracranial bleed original CT [ 8 ] . They find risk factor intracranial hemorrhage age , alcohol consumption , anticoagulation antiaggregation therapy . Five ( 13 % ) patient chronic subdural hematoma treat aspirin . The author conclude patient prophylactic LDA treatment risk develop chronic subdural hematoma . Several study retrospectively evaluate role LDA treatment evolution chronic subdural hematoma . The proportion patient chronic subdural hematoma treat aspirin vary widely . O'Brien et al report treatment w LDA 93 123 ( 76 % ) patient spontaneous hematoma [ 6 ] . On end scale , Rust et al . report treatment 18 81 patient ( 22 % ) [ 9 ] Stroobandt 16 100 ( 16 % ) [ 13 ] . Two study report effect aspirin treatment recurrence rate chronic subdural hematoma drainage . Torohashi et al [ 15 ] retrospectively review 343 consecutive patient treat surgical drainage CSDH subsequent recurrence . Patients advise discontinue anticoagulation antiaggregation one week initial drainage . The author find statistically significant relationship anticoagulation antiaggregation therapy recurrence CSDH , however recurrence occur short interval patient treat anticoagulation antiaggregation therapy . Research Objectives Assess whether continuation low-dose aspirin therapy increase risk development chronic subdural hematoma 3-5 week follow mild head trauma patient 50 year . Assess whether cessation LDA therapy decrease risk development chronic subdural hematoma 3-5 week follow mild head injury patient 50 year . Assess whether cessation LDA therapy associate increase clinically significant adverse event , include myocardial infarction , transient ischemic attack , vascular thrombo-embolic event 3-5 week follow mild head trauma patient 50 year . Establish study protocol may serve basis large definitive multi-institutional study . We hypothesize continuation LDA increase risk CSDH 3-5 week follow-up period minor head trauma . We hypothesize discontinuation LDA 3-5 week associate increase number clinically significant cardiovascular event . Expected Significance There currently consensus regard continuation cessation prophylactic aspirin treatment follow mild head trauma patient immediate evidence hemorrhagic injury . The evidence-based knowledge gain study , large multi-institutional study significant clinical implication . Methods All patient see Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center 's Department Emergency Medicine head trauma examine neurosurgeon call . A complete history take , patient undergo thorough physical neurological examination . Patients report Emergency Department mild trauma treat LDA time injury routinely refer immediate non-contrast head CT . Blood test ass prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , INR , platelet count perform . A detailed history take ascertain reason aspirin therapy . Patients head CT negative traumatic finding , normal neurologic examination change neurological baseline trauma , discharge emergency department . The policy regard continuation discontinuation LDA mild head trauma well establish . We propose offer patient age 50 suffer mild head trauma , LDA therapy ( 75-100 mg ) time trauma , normal neurological examination change neurological baseline trauma , evidence intracranial hemorrhage initial CT , meet inclusion exclusion criterion , participation randomize trial ass effect aspirin continuation versus aspirin cessation . Intake- follow-up examination complete accord standard form use physician involve care participant study ( Appendix 1-2 ) . Informed consent obtain ( Appendix 3 ) . Patients randomize . An attending neuroradiologist read admission CT . Patients find intracranial hemorrhage , possible intracranial hemorrhage exclude study follow appropriately physician Department Neurosurgery . Two week injury , study nurse contact patient telephone , schedule follow-up CT clinic evaluation , follow-up reminder need . Follow-up clinical / neurological examination head CT perform 3-5 week injury . Achieving follow-up CT 3-5 week injury routine patient ' population include study . At final assessment participant evaluate clinical imaging evidence CSDH well intracranial hemorrhage , cardiac , thrombotic , embolic condition . In case clinically significant adverse cardiovascular cerebrovascular event , IRB notify , patient treat appropriate clinical situation . At study completion , LDA prophylaxis prescribe individual patient clinically indicate , cardiology consultation appropriate . Informed Consent The attend neurosurgeon fully explain basis study clinical importance , well risk involve continuation cessation LDA prophylaxis , invite eligible patient participate study . Eligible patient fully conscious agree participate study , legally authorize representative , ask sign inform consent form ( Appendix 3 ) . Patients legal guardian suffer dementia concurrent illness prevents give informed consent , exclude study . Randomization Randomization participant perform remotely via online program . Patients arm 1 request continue aspirin therapy accord previous instruction ; arm 2 request cease aspirin therapy initial 3-5 week follow mild head trauma . Primary Endpoint - Occurrence CSDH Secondary Endpoints - Intervention surgical evacuation CSDH - Occurrence clinically significant intracranial hemorrhage - Intervention surgical evacuation intracranial hemorrhage - Occurrence clinically significant cerebrovascular , cardiovascular , thrombolic , embolic event - Intervention treatment cerebrovascular , cardiovascular , thrombolic , embolic event The possible relationship LDA prophylaxis variety demographic clinical variable also assess , include patient age gender , coagulation profile , mechanism injury , loss consciousness , time elapse traumatic head injury clinically significant sequela . We assess relationship aspirin cessation incidence clinically significant event patient ischemic heart disease . Statistical Analysis Since incidence CSDH patient LDA study directly , currently possible estimate number patient require achieve statistical power research . Study enrollment continue first year , estimate 100 participant period . Based preliminary finding point , expect determine total require study population . The two-proportions test use ass whether statistically significant difference rate CSDH patient randomized cessation LDA therapy randomize continuation LDA . Relationships explanatory dependent variable explore classical parametric nonparametric statistical method , include multivariate analysis , logistic regression , two proportion test , independence test . Several measure association/correlation pair variable analyzed well . With pilot data 100 patient , statistician consult perform power analysis ass require sample size great 80 % chance detect significant difference two group significance level p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
