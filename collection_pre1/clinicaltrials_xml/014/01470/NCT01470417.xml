	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Abraxane Other Investigational Therapies Neoadjuvant Treatment Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This current study proposes conduct prospective non-randomized open-label phase II trial use Gemcitabine Abraxane neoadjuvant treatment resectable borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer . For patient low-risk resectable ( base prediction rule ) plan administer 2 cycle Gemcitabine Abraxane follow additional systemic therapy chemotherapy radiation therapy ( chemoRT ) , follow surgical resection . For patient either borderline-resectable high-risk resectable ( see schema ) , plan administer 2 cycle Gemcitabine Abraxane follow chemoradiotherapy concurrent gemcitabine follow surgical resection . For without high-risk feature , systemic chemotherapy alone administer . The primary endpoint R0 surgical resection rate , biochemical ( CA 19-9 ) , pathologic radiologic response rate . Secondary endpoint include progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , 30-day post-op mortality , toxicity , quality life , pain control , correlative molecular exploratory analysis involve pancreatic tumor stromal SPARC expression level . The investigator also assess patient , tumor , clinical characteristic may predict R0 resectability , thus refine predictive rule high-risk patient define Bao colleague . The investigator ' hypothesis use target risk-adapted chemotherapy chemoRT , improve R0 surgical resection achieve effective systemic therapy deliver , translate significant improvement overall survival patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma , compare publish historical control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas . Patients must locally advanced pancreatic cancer , classify either lowrisk resectable ( LR ) , highrisk resectable ( HR ) borderline resectable ( BR ) Age 18 90 year time consent . Patients biliary obstruction must adequate drainage prior start treatment . Patients must ≤ Grade I peripheral neuropathy ( CTCAE v 4.0 ) Patients must ≤ ECOG Performance status 2 Pretreatment laboratory parameter : Absolute granulocyte/neutrophil count ( AGC/ANC ) ≥ 1.8 thou/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl ALT/SGPT &lt; 10x upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 3 mg/dl Calculated creatinine clearance ( via CockcroftGault ) &gt; 30 mL/min Baseline CA 199 level Signed study specific , IRB stamp informed consent • Evidence distant metastasis include peritoneal seed and/or malignant ascites Previous irradiation abdomen would compromise ability deliver prescribe treatment Prior treatment pancreatic cancer Active , untreated infection Surgical resection tumor ( include biopsy ) Other malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diseasefree least 5 year .
