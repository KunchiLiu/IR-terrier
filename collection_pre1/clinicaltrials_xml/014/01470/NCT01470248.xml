	<brief_summary>The purpose study study effect anticancer drug , Arsenic Trioxide , patient small cell lung cancer fail least one standard chemotherapy regimen well patient unable tolerate standard treatment cancer . The investigator seek establish safety efficacy Arsenic Trioxide patient group . The study include 36 participant small cell lung cancer . The investigator want find effect , good bad , study drug cancer . This study also look specific biomarkers blood tumor tissue may help investigator determine level biomarkers related tumor response treatment . Arsenic Trioxide , also know brand name , Trisenox , chemotherapy drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type blood cancer call Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia . It work part make cancer cell become mature thereby stop grow number likely die .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm small cell lung cancer Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patient must fail find intolerant standard frontline platinumbased regimen . There limit number prior regimen provide patient meet eligibility criterion . Adult patient 18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available use arsenic trioxide patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Life expectancy great 3 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0,1 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m² patient creatinine level institutional normal . Negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hour start study treatment woman childbearing potential Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . No history QTc prolongation syndrome cardiac conduction abnormality evidence normal baseline EKG ( QTc ≤ 450 male ≤ 470 female ) Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Need treatment chemotherapy ( within 4 week ; 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) ; radiotherapy biologic agent ( within 2 week ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis require undergo screen prior enrolment . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition arsenic trioxide . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study Trisenox category D agent potential cause fetal harm . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Trisenox , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Trisenox . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Trisenox . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients require ongoing treatment hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factor ( e.g. , granulocytecolony stimulate factor [ GCSF ] , granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor [ GMCSF ] ) ≤ 2 week prior start study drug . Patients currently receive treatment medication potential prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy History another malignancy within 3 year , except curatively treat basal cell carcinoma skin , ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , early stage prostate cancer without detectable prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) excise carcinoma situ cervix Patient unable unwilling abide study protocol</criteria>
