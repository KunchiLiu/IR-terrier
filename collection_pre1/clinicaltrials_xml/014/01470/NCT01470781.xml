	<detailed_description>Cognitive dysfunction increasingly recognize major feature bipolar disorder ( BD ) , present illness onset , persistent euthymia , associate functional outcome . Deficits qualitatively similar see schizophrenia ( SZ ) , may quantitatively similar patient group , e.g . patient history psychosis . Despite strong association cognitive impairment functional outcome BD , treatment symptom present inadequate . Pharmacotherapies little address cognitive symptom , may even worsen . Psychosocial cognitive remediation ( CR ) treatment develop target symptom functional correlate , show early promise patient SZ improve neurocognition community functioning . However , despite overlap neurocognitive deficit patient SZ BD , study date extend neuroscience-based CR patient BD . The present study aim assess efficacy CR treatment patient BD history psychosis use 70-hour CR paradigm compare dose-matched computer-based control . It hypothesize patient CR group exhibit improvement cognitive community functioning compare control , persist 6-month durability phase . Additionally , putative mechanisms functional change examine , include mediator effect cognitive clinical change community functioning . 130 patient BD history psychosis recruit Psychotic Disorders Programs McLean Hospital randomize either CR computer control group . CR administer use BrainWorks program , neuroscience-based training program show early promise patient SZ . Participants assess measure clinical , cognitive , community function baseline , follow 70-hour treatment control phase , 6 month later . Participants may opt participate fMRI study pre- post-treatment ; rest state , task-based functional connectivity , diffusion tensor image data collect evaluate preliminary evidence neurobiological change train versus control . Additionally , participant may opt participation two task reward sensitivity include Probabilistic Reward task Richard 's Delay Discounting . These task administer pre- post-treatment evaluate role reward treatment response well potential CR modulate reward processing . This project keep NIH 's state strategic priority improve mental health outcome patient strengthen impact National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) -supported research public health , specific recommendation broad implementation effective psychosocial intervention .</detailed_description>
