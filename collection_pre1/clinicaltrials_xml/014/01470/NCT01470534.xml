	<brief_summary>Having operation place enormous burden body , lead development inflammation call 'insulin resistance ' . Insulin resistance mean body unable respond important hormone control use energy . Recent study show patient develop 'higher ' insulin resistance inflammation serious complication take long recover surgery . The investigator know control development insulin resistance inflammation surgery . Similarly , investigator know certain patient develop much insulin resistance inflammation others , even though operation . The main purpose study try find patient prone develop great 'amounts ' insulin resistance inflammation . The investigator also want find whether investigator reduce 'amount ' insulin resistance inflammation patient ( example give carbohydrate [ sugar-based ] drink surgery - show reduce insulin resistance patient group ) . Information study improve way investigator prepare patient surgery help improve patient outcome follow surgery ( reduce complication speed recovery major surgery ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interested participant undergo abdominal ( tummy ) surgery recruit surgical clinic . They ask attend Greenfield Human Physiology Laboratory ask complete two questionnaire . In addition , sample blood , small sample muscle fat thigh take . They undergo low dose X-ray ( DXA scan ) insulin clamp . The insulin clamp involve connect insulin glucose drip around four hour blood pressure pulse monitor regular blood sample take . Participants allocate randomly one two group . One group receive carbohydrate ( sugar ) drink surgery group receive dummy ( placebo ) drink . On day surgery , pre-operative check assessment proceed normal . After participant asleep anaesthetic , blood sample tummy muscle fat sample take surgeon surgical incision . At end surgery , another blood sample muscle fat sample tummy thigh take participant still anaesthetic . On day surgery , blood test tummy thigh muscle fat sample take . Participants also undergo another insulin clamp . The research team follow participant ' progress surgery , decision allow home make medical team responsible care .</detailed_description>
