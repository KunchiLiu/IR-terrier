	<brief_title>A Phase I Study BKM120 Everolimus Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study study combination two anticancer drug , everolimus ( RAD001 ) BKM120 , patient whose cancer longer respond standard treatment patient unable tolerate standard treatment cancer . The investigator seek establish safety take two medication together determine appropriate dos two drug give together well identify potential side effect drug administer together . Another purpose study determine effectiveness side effect combination RAD001 BKM120 look patient 's response treatment . The investigator want find effect , good bad , drug patient 's cancer . This study also look specific biomarkers patient 's blood tumor tissue involve growth tumor cell determine level biomarkers related patient 's response treatment development side effect . Everolimus , also know brand name , Afinitor , biologic drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment kidney cancer . It work prevent cancer cell multiply also render easily susceptible death . BKM120 new study drug test ability treat cancer . However , yet approve FDA treatment specific cancer type .</detailed_description>
