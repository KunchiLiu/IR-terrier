	<brief_summary>Atrogin-1 muscle RING finger-1 skeletal muscle specific gene , ubiquitin ligase activity , upregulated muscle atrophy mouse . The Akt/GSK3 Akt/mTOR pathways involve muscle hypertrophy mouse . Recent study investigator team others demonstrate implication signal pathway control muscle mass human . However study yet investigate involvement system early stage spinal cord injury induce human skeletal muscle atrophy . The investigator propose investigate level expression different component ubiquitin-proteasome system together level expression activity Akt/mTOR Akt/GSK3 signal pathway SCI human first month follow injury . A second aim project ass novel apparatus electrical stimulation generate movement closed-loop electrical muscle stimulation may improve strength muscle mass patient . The patient recruit jointly Clinique Romande de RÃ©adaptation ( CRR ) Sion Swiss paraplegic centre Nottwil . They randomly divide two group , first group patient undergo conventional treatment rehabilitation second set patient treat use brand new system electro-stimulation call MotionMaker TM . Biopsies obtain first week admission ; two biopsy take respectively 3 6 month post-lesion . Our result provide increase understanding molecular mechanism contribute skeletal muscle atrophy early stage follow SCI characterization impact endurance training voluntary innervated muscle . Moreover study also investigate potential improvement rehabilitation process use new system electro-stimulation .</brief_summary>
