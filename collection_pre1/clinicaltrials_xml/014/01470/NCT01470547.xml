	<brief_summary>The portal vein thrombosis ( PVT ) complicate medical condition like liver cirrhosis ( LC ) , neoplasms , myeloproliferative disease , thrombophilic genotype , infection , inflammatory disease , trauma surgery . LC important predisposing disease responsible 20 % case . However , data regard PVT cirrhosis insufficient . Early study show , absence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , PVT occur approximately 10 % cirrhotic patient . Most study support prevalence 5 20 % patient LC . A study transplant recipient , document variable etiology cirrhosis , PVT present 15.7 % patient , high percentage find patient liver cancer ( 34.8 % ) , primary biliary cirrhosis ( 7.9 % ) sclerosing cholangitis ( 3.6 % ) less frequently complicate PVT . The PVT development due stagnation portal circulation , alteration sense inherit acquire pro-coagulant may favor appearance . The causal association PVT bleeding bowel infarction suggest PVT may reduce survival cirrhosis , data lack issue . It also know whether asymptomatic patient PVT different survival compare cirrhotic patient without PVT . Further study conduct clarify issue . Likewise , prospective study need well identify risk factor predispose PVT LC patient well clarify relationship cirrhosis severity PVT . The impact PVT natural history cirrhosis issue today still debate . The PVT favour life-threatening complication ( gastrointestinal bleeding mesenteric thrombosis ) could also contribute deterioration liver function reduce portal flow . Obtaining information would crucial importance consider evidence increase mortality relate PVT liver cirrhosis may indicate need randomize controlled trial clarify potential effectiveness anticoagulant therapy improve survival . To purpose 's proposed establish Italian register patient cirrhosis . In second phase project plan 2-years follow-up program order ass whether PVT additional risk factor mortality deterioration natural history patient cirrhosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective Longitudinal Study . The investigator plan assess baseline schedule follow visit : - Medical history collection thrombosis risk factor evaluation ; - Clinical parameter collection ; - Upper abdomen ultrasound portal district echo color doppler evaluate presence PVT ; - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ; - Routine blood sample collection plasma urine storage ; At every follow visit evaluate relevant clinical event record treatment receive follow-up period . Sample Size : The investigator plan include study n = 1100 patient . The sample size calculate assume expect prevalence 18 % time zero , order obtain confidence interval 95 % prevail time zero whose distance edge less equal 3 % .</detailed_description>
