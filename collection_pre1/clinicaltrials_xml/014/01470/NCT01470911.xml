	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder three distinct component : airway hyper-responsiveness ( respiratory hypersensitivity ) , airway inflammation , intermittent airway obstruction . One characteristic disease inflammatory reaction immune system cause cytokine production . A substantial number asthma patient satisfactorily respond steroid therapy consequently unmet medical need novel target therapy improve specificity , tolerability , compliance . Novel therapeutic strategy treatment chronic inflammatory disease target early disease-causing mechanism promise approach treatment asthma . The transcription factor GATA-3 play key role mediate asthmatic immune response show necessary sufficient production cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -4 , IL-5 , IL-13 . The active principle hgd40 investigational medicinal product SB010 belong new class antisense oligonucleotide therapeutic , 10-23 DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) zymes ( antisense oligonucleotide ) . DNAzymes catalytically active nucleic acid cleave complementary RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) molecule . By cleave GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production thereby reduce key feature allergic airway inflammation . DNAzymes completely generate chemical synthesis produce Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) control condition . The DNAzymes biological drug , i.e . generate use live organism include cell culture bacteria . The molecule highly water-soluble applied solution directly synthesize form . The current study evaluate safety tolerability increase single dos inhale SB010 healthy male subject .</brief_summary>
