	<detailed_description>There evidence certain parasitic infection may protect autoimmune inflammatory disease , include multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , asthma type1 diabetes . The 'hygiene hypothesis ' postulate exposure infectious agent confers protection disorder . One putative mechanism depend activity regulatory T cell ( Treg ) , naturally occur induced cell prevent excessive immune activation autoimmunity . Reports last 5 year lend credence hygiene hypothesis MS : epidemiological investigation show inverse relationship infection nematode Trichuris , study serial clinical , immunological MRI follow-up show MS patient develop intestinal parasitoses much mild disease course compare uninfected match MS control follow 5 year . A role Treg also novel population B regulatory ( Breg ) cell suggest study . The University Nottingham extensive experience human parasite research complete essential safety study control infection hookworm normal volunteer people atopy . Asthma Crohn 's disease study underway show immunological effect even 10 larva . This first control parasite exposure study patient relapse MS 36 patient 25 hookworm larva vs 36 patient placebo . Patients follow clinically ( relapse rate , disability score ) , immunologically radiologically ( serial MRI scan Gadolinium ) 1 year . The cumulative number new active lesion T2 weight MRI primary outcome measure . Regulatory network induction ( Treg induction , Breg/Tr1 NK ) immunological secondary outcome measure . Relapse rate secondary clinical outcome measure . A number clinical , MRI immune parameter exploratory measure . Cytokine profile , eosinophil egg count , IgE IgG subsets IgE/IgG4 ratio measure , relate alter immune response disease modulation . Immune response assess neuroantigen mitogen , parasite antigen ( excretory/secretory product ) . This study essential early step assess potential therapeutic immunomodulation parasite MS .</detailed_description>
