	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well SNS01-T tolerate relapsed refractory multiple myeloma , B cell lymphoma plasma cell leukemia patient give intravenous infusion various dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study SNS01-T Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies ( Multiple Myeloma , B Cell Lymphoma , Plasma Cell Leukemia ( PCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose test safety tolerability SNS01-T . The first group patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma , plasma cell leukemia B cell lymphoma give relatively low dose . If tolerate , second group receive high dose . If tolerated second group , third fourth group receive high dos . Treatment-related adverse event ( side effect ) , change vital sign , physical examination , laboratory value monitor . Patients receive twice weekly infusion 6 week follow monthly 6 month . A secondary purpose explore whether SNS01-T effective treatment multiple myeloma , B cell lymphoma plasma cell leukemia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . B cell lymphoma patient must diagnosis confirm histologically . Plasma cell leukemia ( PCL ) patient must peripheral clonal plasma cell &gt; 20 % peripheral WBC &gt; 2 x 109/L . Multiple myeloma PCL patient must diagnose meet three follow IMWG criterion : Clonal bone marrow plasma cell &gt; 10 % Presence serum and/or urinary Mprotein , absent , kappa lambda serum FLC must &gt; 10 mg/dl accompany abnormal kappa lambda ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) Evidence endorgan damage attribute underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder , specifically , one following : Hypercalcemia : serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/100 mL Renal insufficiency : serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dL Anemia : normochromic , normocytic hemoglobin value &gt; 2 g/100 mL low limit normal hemoglobin value &lt; 10 g/100 mL Bone lesion : lytic lesion , severe osteopenia , pathologic fracture 2 . B cell lymphoma patient must measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure response least two perpendicular dimension . Multiple myeloma patient must measurable disease define follow : Serum Mprotein ≥0.5g/dL urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hour protein electrophoresis If neither serum urine Mprotein meet criterion , kappa lambda serum FLC must ≥10 mg/dL accompany abnormal kappa lambda ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) ( Serum FLC use patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein spike . ) If neither criterion meet , presence plasmacytomata measurable radiographically ( CT , PET MRI ) direct measurement . 3 .
