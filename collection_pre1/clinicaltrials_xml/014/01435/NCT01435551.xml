	<brief_summary>From past research do investigator learn brain cell die &amp; leave deposit brain know beta-amyloid . Since alzheimer 's slow acting disease natural immune system respond illness build brain . As builds get neurotransmitter brain cause brain cell die . As buildup occur dementia set due brain die &amp; effect normal activity . STUDY WAS CANCELLED Hypnotherapy use follow thing : - Increase immune system - The immune system begin clean beta-amyloid buildup - That remove damage cell brain - Increase blood flow brain - Allows active brain cell trained carry daily activity STUDY WAS CANCELLED</brief_summary>

Using hypnotherapy could increase white blood cell brain clean damage . In theory primitive part brain ( 1 % ) job protect body harm . It give fight flight response subconscious mind ( 88 % ) brain . Then conscious mind control body either fight flight . Since Alzheimer 's slow move disease primitive part brain react slow action . So subconscious never get message 's disease brain body could fight . As immune system clean beta-amyloid buildup healthy neurotransmitter able function . Healthy brain cell retrain quality life normal . EXAMPLE : * If imagine drive path across field day day . Before long grass die &amp; rut start form . Next thing know auto hit high center . So move keep get stuck rut . The brain work way . The person thing without think brain trained . But brain retrain function illness . Hypnotherapy session : - One hour long - one session per month 9 month - 3 month free session measure effect STUDY WAS CANCELLED</detailed_description>
