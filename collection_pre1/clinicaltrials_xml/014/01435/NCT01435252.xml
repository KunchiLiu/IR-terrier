	<brief_summary>Sixty patient advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck enrol study . Patients treated standard chemoradiation combination concurrent add-on cetuximab . Subsequently patient randomize cetuximab consolidation therapy ( three month , Arm A ) versus consolidation therapy ( Arm B ) . The aim study investigate cetuximab consolidation therapy improve 2-year locoregional control rate . - Trial medicinal product - Trial radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study In Patients With Advanced Head And Neck Cancer Of Standard Chemoradiation And Add-On Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study translate preclinical finding concurrent consolidation cetuximab improve efficacy RT clinic . It phase II , randomize , open-label , single center study patient locoregionally advanced stage III-IV and/or total gross tumor volume ( tGTV ) &gt; 70cc head neck cancer . This study population high risk locoregional recurrence chemoradiation alone . Tumor stage include T3-4 Nx , Tx N2b-N3 ( N2b ≥ 3 ipsilateral node involve ) M0 and/or tGTV &gt; 70 cc ( T , N , M0 ) squamous cell cancer head neck ( HNSCC ) . All patient receive , call 'Induction Phase ' standard chemoradiation ( RT 70 Gy combination weekly CDDP 40 mg/m2 ) add-on concurrent cetuximab ( load Dose 400 mg/m2 , concurrent dose 250 mg/m2 weekly ) . The patient randomize either add-on consolidation cetuximab ( 500 mg/m2 biweekly x 6 12 week ) ( Arm A ) treatment ( Arm B ) . Randomization take place Induction Phase . The total number patient include study 60 ( 30 patient per arm ) . Up 6 patient may replace case early drop reach aim . The sample size 60 patient consider sufficient collect first information clinical efficacy possible impact various biomarkers clinical endpoint . If result study demonstrate novel treatment regimen safe efficacious , randomized multicenter phase III study follow .</detailed_description>
