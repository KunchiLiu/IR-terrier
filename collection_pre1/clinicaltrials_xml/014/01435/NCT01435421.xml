	<brief_summary>Acute liver failure ( ALF ) result abrupt loss hepatic metabolic synthetic function lead encephalopathy potentially multi-organ dysfunction . Aetiologies include autoimmune metabolic disease , infectious agent hepatotoxin . Worldwide , infectious hepatitis ( A , B E ) common cause . In Western Europe USA , ALF frequently cause paracetamol intoxication . The MBT produce immediate result aid decision make patient acute liver disease . Such test may affect decision-making regard transplantation setting , facilitate appropriate discharge critical care hospital unit home , provide point care assessment therapeutic intervention . The BreathID potentially help determine : - Parameter include patient transplant list ( UNOS 1A group ) - Identification patient deteriorate need extended hospitalization/referral ICU/change management - An addition MELD score estimate risk acute patient - Additional information commonly utilized prognostic score system The primary end-point study develop model predict deterioration liver disease , incorporate measurement MBT along potential variable . The data collect used develop prediction model use data-mining methodology ( linear non-linear regression model , binary tree , neural network , etcâ€¦ ) . The predictive model may include measurement MBT , blood test result , single measurement trend time . The model develop , attempt predict disease deterioration vs. recovery accurately , early time point standard procedure . A threshold determinate base adequate sensitivity specificity level .</brief_summary>
