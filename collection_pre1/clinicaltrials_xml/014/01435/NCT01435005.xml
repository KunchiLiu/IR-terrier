	<detailed_description>Overview The propose project evolution previous randomize control intervention trial conduct applicant know Alberta Physical Activity Breast Cancer Prevention ( ALPHA ) Trial examine one-year aerobic exercise intervention , compare usual sedentary lifestyle , influence specific hypothesize biologic mechanism association physical activity breast cancer risk . In proposed project , plan extend research examine one-year high versus moderate volume aerobic exercise intervention influence establish novel biologic mechanism think influence breast cancer risk . We specifically interested study dose exercise require influence biologic mechanism involve breast cancer etiology . Rationale Significance Inadequate physical activity , high total caloric intake , obesity , central adiposity weight gain throughout lifetime clearly associate increase postmenopausal breast cancer risk risk factor amenable intervention . Over one third breast cancer attribute three risk factor . The exact dose type physical activity require breast cancer risk reduction , however , unknown . No trial conduct systematically examine different volume activity influence mechanisms breast cancer etiology . Study Aims The primary aim compare effect high versus moderate volume exercise intervention specific hormonal biological intermediate endpoint breast cancer group previously sedentary postmenopausal woman . The primary objective examine effect intervention measure adiposity , insulin resistance , sex hormone level , marker obesity inflammation serum vitamin D. The secondary aim evaluate impact high versus moderate exercise intervention among postmenopausal , sedentary woman psychosocial factor . The secondary objective compare effect exercise intervention quality life perceive stress among participant . Adherence exercise intervention 12 maintenance exercise 24 month also assess . Research Plan A two-centered , two-armed randomize controlled trial propose . In total , 330 postmenopausal , sedentary woman age 50-74 year recruit screen program medium campaign . Strict eligibility criterion apply ensure woman enrol study expect change breast cancer risk one-year long intervention . Randomization stratify centre ( Calgary Edmonton ) body mass index ( &lt; â‰¥27.5 ) . The intervention arm undertake aerobic exercise session 300 mins/week 12 month . The control arm ask undertake 150 mins/week 12 month . Baseline 12-month measurement adiposity ( do computerize tomography dual energy X-ray absorbitometry scan ) , fitness , diet , physical activity , quality life stress , determinant exercise adherence medical , health demographic characteristic make . Bloods , drawn baseline , six 12 month , assayed measure estrone , estradiol , testosterone , androstenedione , insulin , glucose , adiponectin , leptin , interleukin-6 , tumour necrose factor-alpha , C-reactive protein serum hydroxyvitamin D. One year completion study , maintenance physical dietary habit measure . Intent-to-treat analysis use Laird-Ware mixed effect model compare change baseline 12-month follow-up . These data direct relevance effectiveness trial exercise diet breast cancer prevention refinement physical activity guideline .</detailed_description>
