	<brief_summary>This proposal design mitigate hemodilution ( blood dilute electrolyte solution ) loss plasma proteins responsible normal blood clot well platelet completion cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . The Hemobag® system device qualify US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Many cardiac center , Englewood Hospital Medical Center Englewood NJ use Hemobag® system Jehovah 's witness patient go center bloodless cardiac surgery ( cardiac surgery perform without use blood blood product ) . The system design filter excessive water blood leave heart lung machine ( cardiopulmonary bypass ) separate patient performance cardiac surgery . Consequently likelihood excessive post-operative bleeding transfusion allogeneic blood ( blood bank blood donor ) decrease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Hemobag® Ultrafiltration System Blood Conservation Coagulation After Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) consist extracorporeal ( outside body ) circuit allow circulation oxygenation blood cardiac surgery . The circuit include oxygenator , reservoir tubing , need prim balanced electrolyte solution . Prior initiate CPB , venous arterial end CPB circuit appropriately attached patient . The volume circuit usually 1.5 liter equivalent 30-38 % typical patient 's total blood volume generally 4 5 liter . When CPB initiate , patient 's blood mixed dilute CPB prim fluid . Consequently , operation complete CPB discontinue , content CPB circuit consist patient 's diluted whole blood . The standard practice return much hemodiluted CPB content patient accommodate process rest content circuit cell washer return pack red blood cell patient . When cell washer use , plasma protein , clot factor platelet return patient . An alternate approach would use ultrafiltration device remove non-cellular water preserve protein , clot factor platelet well red blood cell return patient . This alternate approach basic principle Hemobag® , ultrafiltration technology method . Ultrafiltration well document technique usually use in-line ( interposed circuit ) CPB . The Hemobag® collection reservoir use facilitate ultrafiltration CPB circuit patient disconnect CPB ) . It represent novel safe modification modify ultrafiltration system ( MUF ) . MUF technique commonly use cardiac surgery many year , especially small hemodiluted patient , mainly pediatric population . The focus Hemobag® system whole blood volume recovery oppose red cell volume recovery , help satisfy requirement patient CPB discontinue : hemostasis , reversal dilutional effect , return back homeostasis , normal physiologic metabolic status patient . The investigator hypothesize Hemobag® method return residual CPB blood superior current practice cell wash concentration . This hypothesis base previous study show ultrafiltrated whole blood product superior cell-washed RBC product . The main purpose study discover difference outcome measure , end CPB , residual dilute pump blood process either cell wash Hemobag® method . The null hypothesis state would difference post-operative patient outcome residual pump blood process either cell wash method Hemobag® protocol . Pilot Study : The investigator Maine Medical Center ( MMC ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) -approved pilot study March 2011 consist ten ( 10 ) case order confirm significant treatment effect show study familiarize team Hemobag® system . Outcome metric include chest catheter drainage first 24 hour post-operative , allogeneic blood component requirement ( red blood cell ( RBC 's ) , platelet , plasma ) , platelet count , evidence acute kidney injury Acute Kidney Injury Network ( AKIN ) definition , mortality , stroke , requirement inotropic support second post-operative day . The result pilot study show promising trend regard less chest catheter drainage high platelet count . Materials Methods Analysis : The investigator propose randomize , control trial compare two method describe : The standard method return residual pump volume patient wash , centrifuge cell ( control group ) Hemobag® method return residual CPB blood ( study group ) . Outcome metric pilot study : ( 1 ) Chest catheter drainage first 24 hour post-operative ; ( 2 ) Allogeneic blood component requirement ( RBC 's , platelet , plasma ) ; ( 3 ) Pre post operative platelet count ; ( 4 ) Evidence acute kidney injury AKIN definition ; ( 5 ) Mortality ; ( 6 ) Stroke ; ( 7 ) Requirements inotropic support 2nd post-operative day . The investigator propose enroll 100 patient , 50 control group 50 study group . The study limit adult ( 18 year old ) heart surgery ( valve /or coronary ) use CPB anemia coagulation disorder preoperatively . An interim analysis perform independent , unblended analyst determine efficacy safety half way study ( 50 patient ) . Terminating study early would consideration one group clearly superior safety issue . In event concern regard superiority safety , study would continue entire sample size study . The result interim analysis submit IRB . Conclusion : There number intra-operative blood management strategy cardiac surgery salvage post-CPB whole blood use ultrafiltration CPB circuit emerge one significant contributor reduce allogeneic blood component use cardiovascular surgery . The investigator hypothesize Hemobag® method return residual CPB blood superior current practice cell wash concentration expeditious modify ultrafiltration ( MUF ) .</detailed_description>
