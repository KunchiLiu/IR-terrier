	<brief_summary>Thromboembolic complication ( TCs ) important cause morbidity mortality pediatric cardiac surgery , result long hospital stay , increase risk early late post-surgical complication , early reoperation , neurologic organ damage , potentially death . The true incidence blood clot pediatric surgical patient unknown . The overarch objective study understand TCs , include quantification , characterization risk stratification . This study ultimately allow development effective tool prevention early identification TCs , rather focus treatment alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There limit data TCs associate cardiac surgery pediatric patient . The actual incidence TCs context currently know reflect lack clinical suspicion , report bias , and/or use inappropriate diagnostic test Pediatric cardiac surgery associate disruption blood flow , platelet dysfunction activation , blood hypercoagulability ; contribute clot formation All congenital heart defect associate blood flow disturbance associate extreme disturbance . The investigator hypothesize type CHD repair risk TCs base extent blood flow disturbance cause . The investigator hypothesize line location , difficulty line insertion , include multiple insertion attempt long duration indwell associate increased risk TCs . Pediatric cardiac surgery associate inflammation platelet activation , potent contributor blood hypercoagulability : CPB present hemostatic challenge associate abundance pro-thrombotic risk factor opposite presence pro-hemorrhagic risk factor . The investigator hypothesize factor associate increased platelet activation inflammation , consequence , great laboratory value marker platelet activation inflammation , associate increase risk TCs . Coagulation system activity child immature , hyporeactive exhibit high degree resistance heparin anticoagulation . The investigator theorize low level coagulation system activity , presence high-risk genetic polymorphism , great CPB hemodilution , increase heparin requirement low blood heparin activity express anti-factor X activity ( anti-Xa ) concentration CPB great requirement allogeneic blood associate increase risk TCs . There lack consensus clinical laboratory signs/symptoms active thrombosis patient routinely screen TCs . One difficult aspects management TCs fact many episode asymptomatic non-specific symptom . Creating risk stratification model include clinical laboratory abnormality could indicative TCs post-operative period order identify patient undergo target screening third aim study . Many method TC management limit effectiveness highly effective method often associate much risk . The use thrombolytic child rare partially effective many case . The margin safety treatment think narrow ; report frequency major bleed episodes varies 5 % 40 % . Outcomes TCs suboptimal , early surgical long-term complication survivor frequent . The creation risk stratification model suboptimal surgical outcome , PTS syndrome , low functional health status surgery fourth final aim study .</detailed_description>
