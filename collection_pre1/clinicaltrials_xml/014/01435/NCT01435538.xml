	<brief_title>European Quality Care Pathways Study Effect Care Pathways Interprofessional Teamwork ( EQCP-TEAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Although care pathway often say promote teamwork , high-level evidence support statement lacking . The objective European Quality Care Pathway ( EQCP ) study therefore study impact care pathways interprofessional teamwork . Methods/design An international post-test-only cluster Randomized Controlled Trial ( cRCT ) , combine process evaluation , perform Belgium , Ireland , Italy Portugal . Teams care Proximale Femur Fracture ( PFF ) patient patient hospitalized exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) randomize intervention control group . The intervention group implement care pathway PFF COPD contain three active component : formative evaluation actual team ' performance , set evidence base key intervention train pathway-development . The control group provide usual care . As effect measure set team input , process output indicator use . Main outcome indicator team process indicator relational coordination . Next , process measure use evaluate implementation process . In total , 132 team agree participate , 68 randomly assign intervention group 64 control group . Based power analysis , sample 475 team member per arm require . To analyze result , multilevel analysis perform . Discussion The EQCP-study teamwork first cluster-randomized control trial impact care pathways interprofessional teamwork . Results study enhance understanding active component care pathway . Through , preferred implementation strategy define .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion cluster level require write agreement participate form hospital management , medical head division head nurse Next , agree develop implement care pathway COPD exacerbation PFF within time frame study randomize control group Finally , participate hospital need expect volume one hundred COPDexacerbation PFF patient annually . To comparable sample across cluster , follow inclusion criterion individual level set : 1 . All professional accord medical head division head nurse member interprofessional team care COPDexacerbation PFF patient admission discharge acute hospital ward 2 . To part interprofessional care team conceptualize part group clinicians staff share clinical purpose direct care responsibility respective patient group set time period 3 . All individual participant need member team one specific week , patient follow two trial EQCPproject ( 8 ) . This specific week choose study coordinator define average week , normal staff ratio 4 . Because want study interprofessional teamwork , cluster ask minimally include orthopedic surgeons/pneumologists , head nurse , nurse , physiotherapist social worker sample . Based judgment , chief medical doctor , consensus head nurse , decide include professional group sample 5 . In hospital COPDexacerbation PFF patient admit multiple nursing ward , e.g . due capacity problem organizational issue . If case , cluster ask include team member work ward respective patient group admit frequently . All team member work ( e.g . leave ) choose week All team member temporarily part team ( e.g . student nurse train ) .</criteria>
