	<brief_summary>Recurrent major depressive disorder affect 3−5 % population . It anticipated 2020 , depression common cause disability worldwide 18−55 age group . About two−thirds patient respond first−line treatment ( antidepressant ) . In addition , prolonged administration antidepressant patient respond result remission 80 % patient per year . However , significant proportion patient either fail respond spite determine pharmacological treatment , electroconvulsive therapy treatment achieve sustain remission . The personal , psychiatric , medical , social economic consequence devastate , treatment resistant , patient . This investigation aim evaluate feasibility deep brain stimulation patient treatment resistant depression viable alternative ablative neurosurgery.The hypothesis patient respond stimulation one site rather patient respond double rather single site stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients select accord inclusion/ exclusion criterion referral psychiatric team , exceptional case , GP . Patients refer trial assess Dr Malizia ( Consultant Senior Lecturer ) Treatment Resistant Disorders Psychopharmacology clinic Bristol Royal Infirmary . Informed write consent baseline measure take patient . We plan recruit 8 patient treatment resistant unipolar depression single blind trial bilateral consecutive deep brain stimulation Cg25 ventral anterior capsule separately together . Medication leave unchanged maintain level end study postoperatively . However , medication think potentially detrimental long term stop reduce prior surgery period least 6 week stability prescribe medication require prior baseline assessment . The surgical procedure general anaesthesia consist implant bilateral deep brain stimulating electrode ( four overall ) Brodmann 's area 25 nucleus accumbens/ ventral anterior capsule . Following operation period one−week recovery allow minimise effect secondary target impact effect surgery post−operative oedema . After recovery combination electrodes maximal response assess double blind design ( patient raters ) . Stimulation bilateral . Four patient randomise receive Cg25 stimulation first 4 patient randomise receive anterior capsule/ventral striatal stimulation first . Patients blind order stimulation , contact select 'off ' period contact selection process . After least four month patient crossover alternative site stimulation unless achieve remission ( MADRS &lt; 8 least two month ) . Patients raters still blind site stimulation . After four month selection set contact achieve best result . If MADRS score &lt; 8 one location significant improvement occur ( MADRS &gt; 18 improvement &lt; 25 % ) , one set contact stimulate . Clinical assessment least two monthly average . The full evaluation procedure last average 18 month surgical implantation electrode .</detailed_description>
