	<brief_summary>In survivor extreme prematurity 36 week Post Menstrual Age ( PMA ) , specific biologic , physiologic clinical data obtain initial hospitalization predict respiratory morbidity define respiratory health care utilization respiratory symptom , discharge 1 year correct age . This protocol describe collaboratively developed multicenter study preterm infant birth time discharge Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) 1 year age , correct degree prematurity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prematurity Respiratory Outcomes Program ( PROP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal PROP study identify biomarkers ( biochemical , physiological genetic ) clinical variable associate thus potentially predictive pulmonary status preterm infant 1 year correct age . An objective validated measure pulmonary outcome 1 year currently exist . Some promising measure development yet ready use multi-center large clinical study . Moreover , burden chronic respiratory illness infant family utmost importance . A composite primary outcome morbidity base serial parental report respiratory symptom , medication , hospitalization dependence technology first year life develop . Data collection outcome assessment base interview conduct infant 's main caregiver 3 , 6 , 9 12 month correct age . The time frame data collection base question `` since last contact . '' Numerous epidemiological study asthma use parental self report symptom , physician-diagnosed asthma allergy , use medication ( may abrogate symptom ) critical outcome . Survey item select determination primary outcome focus follow four domain , positive response element identify morbidity : 1 . Respiratory medication : inhaled bronchodilator , inhaled steroid , systemic steroid , methylxanthines , diuretic , pulmonary vasodilator 2 . Hospitalizations cardiopulmonary cause : hospitalization regardless duration 3 . Symptoms : wheeze , cough without cold 4 . Home technology dependence : use home oxygen , ventilator continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP BiPAP ) duration since last contact The primary outcome dichotomous , define `` No substantial post-prematurity respiratory disease '' `` Post-prematurity respiratory disease . '' To classify post-prematurity respiratory disease , infant must positive response least 1 4 morbidity domain least 2 separate parental interview . Quarterly data collection 1 year correct age allow u identify phenotype base trajectory post-prematurity respiratory disease different trajectory predict later lung function diagnosis asthma , continue follow cohort child . During hospitalization , center obtain sample tracheal aspirate , urine saliva ( DNA extraction ) enrol infant . At 36 week PMA , infants respiratory assessment dependent upon respiratory status : ) respiratory inductive plethysmography ( RIP ) assess alteration tidal breathe result reduce lung compliance airway obstruction , ii ) room air challenge ( RAC ) .</detailed_description>
