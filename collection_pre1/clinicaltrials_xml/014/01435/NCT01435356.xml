	<detailed_description>This study assess investigational treatment patient Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer urinary bladder surgically remove . The investigational treatment aim increase body 's immune response specific antigen express cancer . The tumour tissue first test whether express MAGE-A3 antigen . The MAGNOLIA study open male female patient pathologically confirm muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma urinary bladder expression antigen MAGE-A3 without limited lymph node involvement evidence disease surgery confirm imaging procedure ( scan CT/MRI ) .</detailed_description>

TNM classification pathological examination surgically remove specimen : Stage T2,3 N0 N1 N2 M0 disease Stage T4 N0 M0 disease . 5 . The patient free residual disease free metastasis , confirm negative baseline Computer Tomogram ( CT scan ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) pelvis , abdomen chest 13 week prior randomization . Other examination perform clinically indicate . 6 . Patient fully recover surgery within 13 week follow cystectomy . For patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy , patient fully recover within 36 week follow chemotherapy . 7 . The patient must adequate bonemarrow reserve , define absolute neutrophil count 1.0 x 109/L , platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L , adequate renal function , define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , adequate hepatic function , define Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN , Alanine transaminase ( ALAT ) Aspartate Transaminase ( ASAT ) ≤ 2.5 time ULN assess standard laboratory criterion . 8 . World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 time randomization . 9 . If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e . current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy post menopausal , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception 30 day prior administration study treatment , negative pregnancy test continue precaution study treatment period 2 month completion injection series . 10 . The patient affiliate health insurance benefit insurance 1 . The patient previous concomitant malignancy sit except effectively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , incidental localise prostatic carcinoma effectively treat malignancy remission 5 year . 2 . The patient receive anti cancer systemic treatment , include immunotherapy ( local intravesical BCG allow ) , chemotherapy , except : For treatment previous malignancy allow protocol ( i.e. , nonmelanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , incidental localise prostatic carcinoma effectively treat malignancy remission 5 year ) . For treatment neoadjuvant chemotherapy muscle invasive bladder cancer For treatment adjuvant cisplatinumbased chemotherapy muscle invasive bladder cancer 3 . The patient receive radiotherapy abdominal pelvic region , within 6 month prior randomization . 4 . Women pregnant breast feeding . 5 . The patient know infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) chronic hepatitis B C. 6 . The patient history allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component study investigational product . 7 . The patient confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition potential immunemediated disease . Patients vitiligo excluded participate trial . 8 . Patient receive major organ allograft . 9 . The patient require concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent . Note : use prednisone , equivalent , &lt; 0,125 mg/kg/day ( absolute maximum 10 mg/day ) , inhaled corticosteroid topical steroid permit . 10 .
