	<detailed_description>As recommend Expert Committee Selection Use Essential Medicines , WHO ( http : //www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/en/index.html ) , oral solid formulation prefer form medicine child , especially develop country , relatively inexpensive less complicated manufacturing , transport storage process . Whereas solid dosage form advantageous pharmaceutical logistics , administer solid formulation infant child challenge issue . Dissolving medicine water may acceptable , safety drinking water infant develop country water solubility drug major concern . These challenge exemplify treatment infectious disease diarrhea infant . Commonly use drug infant low income setting include antibiotic amoxicillin . Expert source suggest drug administration breast milk may effective . However , little data currently available support recommendation administer medication dissolve breast milk infant . The second stage project use information obtain first stage , combine pre-existing data , define rational dosing schedule target drug dissolve human milk young child , use population PK model simulation . This study silico .</detailed_description>
