	<brief_summary>The purpose study , Effects Interaction Caffeine Hydration Voice Performance , gather information effect caffeine hydration upon voice performance . The research question involve whether systemic hydration may reduce degradation voice performance cause caffeine ingestion . It hypothesize hydration condition result less degraded vocal performance compare nonhydration condition.The investigation involve abstention caffeine ingestion 24 hour - 8pm day test 8am morning testing . In addition , preparation participation involve abstain ingest food liquids 12 hour - 8pm 8am follow morning . Each test take 10 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective investigation explore interaction water caffeine voice performance ( ) acoustic measure voice , ( b ) aerodynamic measurement ( minimum lung pressure require initiate phonation . The acoustic aerodynamic measurement select study effort demonstrate effect four level hydration caffeine status voice quality : 1 ) caffeine water1 ( i.e.. , Experimental Group 1 - ingestion 200 mg caffeine conjunction 500 ml water ) , 2 ) caffeine water2 ( i.e. , Experimental Group 2 - ingestion 200 mg caffeine conjunction 1.0 liter water ) , 3 ) caffeine ( i.e. , Experimental Group 3 : ingestion 200 mg caffeine water ) , 4 ) control ( i.e . ingestion caffeine water ) . The research question involve whether systemic hydration may reduce degradation voice performance cause caffeine ingestion . It hypothesize hydration condition result less degraded vocal performance compare nonhydration condition . Additionally , hypothesize ingestion 1.0 liter water great effect voice performance ingestion 500 ml water . An additional objective study increase scientific knowledge voice function provide data effect interaction water caffeine voice performance . The result project may valuable addition scientific literature vocology , may also contribute prevention plan minimize vocal disturbance . Therefore , vocational program may include vocal prevention direction base study . In addition , knowledge prevention voice disorder may include academic curriculum student enrol training program profession involve substantial voice use .</detailed_description>
