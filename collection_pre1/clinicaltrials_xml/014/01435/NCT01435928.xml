	<criteria>Open Label : Subject provide write informed consent willing able comply protocol opinion Investigator . Subject ≥ 18 ≤ 75 year age , day signing inform consent . Subject meet DSMIVTR criterion primary diagnosis schizophrenia [ include disorganize ( 295.10 ) , paranoid ( 295.30 ) , undifferentiated ( 295.90 ) subtypes establish clinical interview ( use DSMIVTR reference confirm use SCIDCT ) ] . The duration subject 's illness whether treat untreated must ≥ 1 year . Subject least one prior episode psychotic exacerbation judge Investigator two year precede screening . Subject PANSS Total score ≥ 80 score ≥ 4 1 PANSS Positive subscale item screen openlabel baseline ( Visit 2 ) . Subject CGIS score ≥ 4 screen openlabel baseline ( Visit 2 ) . Subject pregnant ( must negative serum pregnancy test screening ) nursing ( must lactate ) planning pregnancy within project duration study . Female subject reproductive potential agrees remain abstinent use adequate reliable contraception throughout study least 30 day last dose lurasidone take . In Investigator 's judgment , subject adhere requirement . Adequate contraception define continuous use either two barrier method ( e.g. , condom spermicide diaphragm spermicide ) hormonal contraceptive . Acceptable hormonal contraceptive include follow : ) contraceptive implant ( Norplant® ) implant least 90 day prior screen ; b ) injectable contraception ( medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ) give least 14 day prior screen ; c ) oral contraception take direct least 30 day prior screen . Subjects nonreproductive potential , i.e. , subject surgically sterile , undergone tubal ligation , postmenopausal ( define least 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) concentration within postmenopausal range determine laboratory analysis ) require remain abstinent use adequate contraception . Subject able agrees remain prior antipsychotic medication duration study . Subject stable living arrangement time screen agrees return similar living arrangement discharge , hospitalize . This criterion mean exclude subject temporarily leave stable living arrangement ( e.g. , due psychosis ) . Such subject remain eligible participate protocol . Chronically homeless subject enrol . Subject good physical health basis medical history , physical examination , laboratory screening . Subject require concomitant medication treatment follow agent may include stable dos ( i.e. , minor adjustment ) specify time : 1 ) antidepressant agent ( except fluvoxamine ) and/or mood stabilizer ( except carbamazepine oxcarbazepine ) must stable least 30 day prior openlabel baseline , 2 ) oral hypoglycemics must stable least 30 day prior screen , 3 ) antihypertensive agent must stable least 30 day prior screen , 4 ) thyroid hormone replacement must stable least 90 day prior screen . ( Note : CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor allow ) . Subject willing able comply protocol assessment visit , opinion study nurse/coordinator Investigator . Doubleblind Subject must achieve maintain clinical stability total least 12 week open label phase , define : 1. PANSS Total score ≤ 70 , CGIS score &lt; 4 PANSS item score ≤ 4 ( moderate less ) PANSS Positive subscale item least 12 week allowance two excursion ( except last 4 week openlabel phase ) assess weekly study visit : • An excursion define PANSS total score maximum 80 and/or CGIS score maximum 4 and/or PANSS Positive subscale item score maximum 5 . 2. PANSS item score ≤ 4 ( moderate less ) item G8 ( uncooperativeness ) 3. take stable dose lurasidone last 4 week openlabel phase . Open Label Subject DSMIV Axis I Axis II diagnosis schizophrenia primary focus treatment within 3 month screen . Subject answer `` yes '' `` Suicidal Ideation '' item 4 ( active suicidal ideation intent act , without specific plan ) item 5 ( active suicidal ideation specific plan intent ) CSSRS assessment screening ( past month ) baseline .

Subject currently clinically significant medical condition include follow : neurological , metabolic ( include Type 1 diabetes ) , hepatic , renal , hematological , pulmonary , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , and/or urological disorder unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( uncontrolled ) , central nervous system ( CNS ) infection would pose risk subject participate study might confound result study . Subjects human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositivity ( history seropositivity ) exclude . Note : Active medical condition minor wellcontrolled exclusionary affect risk subject study result . In case impact condition upon risk subject study result unclear , Medical Monitor consult . Any subject know cardiovascular disease condition ( even control ) must discuss Medical Monitor screen . Subject evidence chronic organic disease CNS tumor , inflammation , active seizure disorder , vascular disorder , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease form dementia , myasthenia gravis , degenerative process . In addition , subject must history mental retardation persistent neurological symptom attributable serious head injury . Note : Past history febrile seizure , druginduced seizure , alcohol withdrawal seizures exclusionary . Note : Past history febrile seizure , druginduced seizure , alcohol withdrawal seizures exclusionary . Subject demonstrate evidence acute hepatitis , clinically significant chronic hepatitis , evidence clinically significant impaired hepatic function clinical laboratory evaluation . Note : Subjects serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level ≥ 3 time upper limit reference range provide central laboratory require retesting . If retesting , laboratory value remain ≥ 3 time upper limit , subject discuss Medical Monitor enrollment consideration . Subject history stomach intestinal surgery condition could interfere judge Investigator interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion study drug . Subject Type 1 Type 2 insulindependent diabetes . Subject newly diagnose Type 2 diabetes screen . Subject Type 2 diabetes eligible study inclusion follow condition meet screening : subject currently treat oral antidiabetic medication ( ) , dose must stable least 4 week prior screen . Such medication may adjust discontinue study , clinically indicate . Subject abnormal laboratory parameter screen indicates clinically significant medical condition determine Investigator . Subjects fast blood glucose screen ≥ 126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L ) HbA1c ≥ 7.0 % exclude . Note : Subjects random ( nonfasting ) blood glucose screen ≥ 200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L ) must retested fasted state . Subject prolactin concentration &gt; 100 ng/mL screen history pituitary adenoma . Subject history malignancy &lt; 5 year prior sign inform consent , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer . Pituitary tumor duration exclude . Subject judge resistant antipsychotic treatment define one following : 1. failure respond &gt; 2 market antipsychotic agent , give adequate dose adequate duration ( within past 2 year ) 2. history treatment clozapine refractory psychosis Subject unlikely achieve stable condition ≥ 12 week openlabel lurasidone phase base totality evidence psychiatric history and/or current presentation . Subject receive antipsychotic medication maximum recommend ( countryspecific ) dose prior screening , judgment Investigator , unlikely respond standard dose lurasidone . Subject receive depot antipsychotic unless last injection least one treatment cycle least 30 day ( whichever longer ) prior screen phase . Subject receive treatment MAO inhibitor within 14 day prior screen phase . Subject require treatment potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer study ( see Appendix 3 ) .

The exception include caffeine nicotine abuse/dependence . Subject test positive drug abuse screen . In event subject test positive cannabinoids ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) , Investigator evaluate subject 's ability abstain use drug study . This information discuss Medical Monitor prior study enrollment . Subject history presence abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , Investigator 's opinion clinically significant ( Medical Monitor may consult determine clinical significance ) . Subject poor peripheral venous access limit ability draw blood judge Investigator . Subject history hypersensitivity 2 distinct chemical class drug ( e.g. , sulfas penicillin ) .
