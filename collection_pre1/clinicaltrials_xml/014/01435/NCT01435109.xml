	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common chronic condition lead cause pain disability among adult . Many adult OA significant pain functional limitation , even though receive medical care OA . Efforts need help adult improve OA-related outcome . This study examine three different approach help adult manage OA-related symptom . The study compare patient-based intervention ( involve exercise , weight management , cognitive behavioral pain management ) , provider-based intervention ( involve provision patient-specific recommendation care , base evidence-based guideline ) , combination two intervention , relative usual care among patient hip and/or knee osteoarthritis . The intervention relatively low cost easy disseminate , patient component telephone base . This study provide novel , valuable information effectiveness ( cost-effectiveness ) three intervention context real-world clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evidence-based guideline emphasize adequate management osteoarthritis ( OA ) require combination medical behavioral modality . However , many recommend guideline regularly incorporated clinical practice , recommend behavioral strategy ( e.g . exercise weight management ) practice patient . Prior study examine strategy improve patient behavior manage OA-related symptom , study examine provider-based intervention specifically patient OA , combination patient- provider-based intervention . The objective study compare patient-based intervention ( involve exercise , weight management , cognitive behavioral pain management ) , provider-based intervention ( involve provision patient-specific recommendation care , base evidence-based guideline ) , combination two intervention , relative usual care . This study provide novel , valuable information effectiveness ( cost-effectiveness ) three intervention context real-world clinical setting . This randomize controlled trial involve follow four study arm : 1 ) Patient Behavioral Intervention OA Only , 2 ) Provider Intervention OA Only , 3 ) Patient Behavioral Intervention + Provider Intervention OA , 4 ) Usual Care Control ( intervention ) . Approximately 10 primary care practice Duke Primary Care Research Consortium ( PCRC ) randomize either Provider Intervention Provider Control group . Within clinic , patient symptomatic knee and/or hip OA ( n=560 total ) randomly assign either Patient Intervention Patient Control group . Participants equally allocate four study group , randomization stratify accord gender race ( white/non-white ) . The patient behavioral intervention twelve-month program include follow element : write educational material ( focused exercise , weight management , cognitive behavioral pain management ) , exercise video tailor patient low extremity OA , telephone call counselor support behavior change . All participant study continue usual medical care receive OA . The provider intervention involve give information patient ' OA symptom treatment , well patient-specific evidence-based recommendation care . Providers access information , well facilitated referral patient-specific treatment recommendation ( e.g . physical therapy , orthopedics ) , point clinical care . The primary time point outcome assessment 12-months . The investigator also assess limited set outcome via telephone 6-months , 18-months , 24-months . Following completion study follow-up assessment , participant assign one two Participant arm give material intervention , health care provider part one two Provider arm give information involve intervention . The primary outcome Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . Secondary outcome include objective physical function ( Short Physical Performance Test ) depressive symptom ( PHQ-8 ) . The main study analysis compare outcomes four study group . The investigator also assess cost-effectiveness intervention .</detailed_description>
