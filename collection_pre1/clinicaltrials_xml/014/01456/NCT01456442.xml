	<brief_summary>The aim monocentric , prospective , non randomise study 25 healthy volunteer assess anorectal function ( i.e rectal compliance sensory threshold ) health short protocol barostat versus conventional procedure ( i.e . standard barostat protocol high resolution anorectal manometry ) . Anorectal dysfunction key mechanism development fecal incontinence symptom obstructive defecation . In study volunteer examine - explanation , physical examination verification in- exclusion criterion - anorectal barostat short standard protocol well proctoscopy endoanal ultrasound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Protocol Barostat Assessment Anorectal Function Versus Standard Protocol Barostat Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For coordinate anorectal function addition anal sphincter perception rectal distension ( visceral perception ) elasticity / compliance anorectum stool consistency important . A disturbed anorectal function may lead functional defecation disorder incontinence . The currently available method measure physiological assessment anorectal function mostly focus measurement sphincter pressure , generally provide complete explanation underlie pathophysiology defecation disorder . By voluntary contraction striate muscle external anal sphincter puborectalis muscle defecation delay . In addition , however , continence mechanism play important role . The Group Study functional gastrointestinal disorder Clinic Gastroenterology University Hospital Zurich great expertise establishment new research method already routine clinical practice use high-resolution anorectal manometry conduct numerous study anorectal Barostat . To use result Barostat also everyday clinical practice patient defecation disorder technique mean significant simplification instrumental methodology shorten work described literature . Before simplified barostat use shorten protocol different patient group clinical practice , generally require validation technique healthy subject define range normal value .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Healthy men woman 18 65 year age without gastrointestinal disease need medical surgical treatment . No medication ( exception occasional intake paracetamol ) Availability investigation ( high resolution anorectal manometry , anorectal barostat short standard protocol , proctoscopy endoanal ultrasound ass sphincter morphology ) Good communication study doctor meeting study requirement . Written consent detail explanation study . Exclusion criterion : Gastrointestinal symptom especially fecal incontinence obstruct defecation Structural functional change upper low GI Tract ( i.e gastric ulcer , malignancy , symptom IBS ) Symptomatic manometrically diagnose motility disorder upper low GI tract example anismus Surgery intervention low upper GI tract ( appendectomy hernia exclude ) include congenital malformation Pelvic radiation therapy Fecal incontinence , define involuntary loss liquid hard stool Functional defecation disorder define ROME III criterion . Pregnancy history vaginal delivery . Acute chronic disease ( example IBD ) Malignancy Intake medication one week prior study begin . Anticoagulants medication influence GI motility like prokinetics , calcium channel blocker antibiotic Drug alcohol use Pregnancy lactation Women reproductive age receive pregnancy test inclusion study . Physical , mental , neurological psychiatric condition limit ability meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
