The insecticide release characteristic enable deltamethrin diffuse slowly out surface become available pick-up insect land surface . Consequently ITPS dual purpose : provide shelter vector-control potential . Deployment erection ITPS do way standard tarpaulin shelter . Until evaluation ITPS limit small scale entomological test scientifically control environment 'entomological platform ' Asian 'experimental hut ' rural African setting ( Refer Citation Section ) . Before novel control tool go forward recommendation WHO , use routinely humanitarian crisis , clear demonstration impact malaria morbidity emergency refugee setting essential . A Phase III field evaluation therefore conducted evaluate impact ITPS malaria incidence young child area intense transmission . A unique feature trial set - true emergency - two newly build refugee camp Liberian refugee displace Sierra Leone .
