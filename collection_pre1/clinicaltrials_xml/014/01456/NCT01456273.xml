	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Addressing high cost involve new medical technology ( biotechnology ) problem lead individual public health service feel increasingly powerless . Many author say even efficient use resource ensure good care health care , true bottomless pit . The problem conceptual ideological base think act professional involve . The first misunderstanding `` narrow approach '' second `` process medicalization . '' The curative model restrict approach The curative model get name concerned cause disease process ( prevention ) , effect ( disease ) . As effect mitigate even extinct , temporary , sooner later return format , individual another . It extremely costly individual society , solution palliative . The approach limit result . The process medicalization Medicalization ultimate expression distortion think consequence model health care regulation . It understand increasingly high dependence individual society overestimate role biotechnology could play , create dependency one believe problem , regardless severity causal link , life-saving treatment . The wrong posture maintenance unhealthy habit The model health care lead wrong posture . Many today 's health problem direct causal relationship passive attitude individual , delegate ( health care biotechnology ) full responsibility treat ailment , reluctant bring change habit behavior `` curative medicine hold doctor take magic bullet get problem solve . '' The strong interest maintain heal model The curative model tendency concentrate application biotechnology strengthen multinational pharmaceutical industry large firm highly sophisticated biomedical equipment . This generate stunning increase expenditure health well strong interest market maintain hegemonic space emphasis `` cure ( medicalization life '' , rather emphasis prevention change habit . Aim study This study aim test , patient functional dyspepsia , model example medical care base upon biopsychosocial model ( call : therapeutic encounter ) compare standard medical care base upon biomedical model ( call : medical consultation ) . What biopsychosocial model The biopsychosocial model focus exclusively organic disease . It consider think process become ill multiple causality . It try understand man , psychological , biological , socio-cultural spiritual interconnection . It argue way become ill construction life history individual , psychological physiological inextricably link . In perspective , disease become expression internal conflict , personal character link person 's relationship world ( environment ) . This approach important consequence medical practice doctor 's focus attention shift individual disease . The medical care base upon biopsychosocial model conserve characteristic art medicine . Art sense craftsmanship ( `` tailor '' ) oppose biomedical technique ( systematize , generalize ) . In fact one must know deeply technique apply art . The primary focus continue patient common others , quirk ( art medicine ) . It consider less important particular treatment work , think majority patient ( technique ) , whether work particular patient , personal problem moment life environment , location country region world . Why test functional dyspepsia patient Functional dyspepsia part group diseases call `` Functional Disorders Gastrointestinal Tract '' go beyond biomedical model : - They define variable combination symptom , explain structural biochemical change . - The diagnostic criterion parameter well bad base symptom report patient , cause skepticism face traditional medical view . There objective criterion assess disorder . Why use placebo The use placebo study justify due fact : - Symptoms functional dyspepsia high rate improvement placebo . Comparative study drug show placebo effect order 30 40 % . - rule placebo effect , magnitude drug therapy compare placebo . Justification study This study justify several reason , mainly limitations biomedical model . - The change epidemiological profile ( occur recent decade ) increasingly leave clear role psychological , socio-cultural spiritual factor , express personality lifestyle . - The biomedicine progress sophistication show inability provide satisfactory conclusive answer many problem , especially subjective component come great less degree disease . Biomedicine limit explanatory power . Many medical professional realize psychological reaction patient socioeconomic problem involve disease see incorporate information formulate diagnosis treatment decision . The idea ilness phenomenon less accidental , originate biochemical process body restrict , therefore produce restricted result .</detailed_description>
