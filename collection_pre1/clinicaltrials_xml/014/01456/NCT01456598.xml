	<brief_summary>- It confirm laparoscopic surgery decrease postoperative pain reduces recovery period various surgical field cholecystectomy colectomy etc . Also , clinical evidence laparoscopic surgery applicable malignant tumor accord development surgical technique medical instrument . - In case early stage gastric cancer , diverse clinical evidence , gastrectomy commonly apply , however , open surgery still apply advanced gastric cancer due lack clinical evidence . - In Korea , approximately 38 % patient undergo surgery gastric cancer diagnose T2-T3 ( AJCC 6th edition ) ( www.i-kgca.or.kr , National gastric cancer registration business 2009 ) . There various clinical evidence apply laparoscopic surgery patient , however , retrospective cohort study result . - For clinical application surgical treatment regard locally advanced gastric cancer use laparoscopic surgical technique , require confirmation definite execution laparoscopic gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection safety surgery oncological usefulness verify . - In order , possible confirm comparison short-term surgical result ( complication , mortality , operative time duration hospitalization etc ) long-term result ( survival rate recurrence rate etc ) laparoscopic surgery open surgery base multicenter large-sized randomized prospective study current standard treatment .</brief_summary>
