	<brief_summary>Thank interest investigator Genetics Blood Pressure Research Study . The National Institutes Health sponsor u investigate patient develop high blood pressure , atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) , heart disease . There two part investigator research program . The first part screen visit . At visit give brief physical exam ask question concern medical history . During visit blood drawn routine screening prepare DNA genetic testing . You also ask collect urine sample routine screening . If doctor find healthy candidate invite participate second part study . During Phase II , investigator perform physiological test place low salt diet place high salt diet . If blood pressure medication , may necessary discontinue take present medication three month begin study . Patients discontinue current blood pressure medication may place different blood pressure medication washout period necessary maintain blood pressure pre-study level . The investigator take medication two week prior schedule in-patient study ( overnight visit ) . Once blood pressure medication discontinue , closely monitored make sure encounter difficulty . If home blood pressure monitor , investigator provide one use study keep daily record blood pressure reading . The investigator ask call u every three day report blood pressure reading . Less 20 % patient significant increase blood pressure short time therapy . After stop take medication , dieticians hospital make low salt meal eat home seven day . On seventh day low salt diet , ask begin 24-hour urine collection bring admit hospital evening . That morning , require come Clinical Research Center one-hour test check body correct salt balance . You return even inpatient Clinical Research Center admit study occur next morning . On morning low salt study , naturally occur hormone administer blood sample draw intravenous needle . The investigator also take ultrasound picture heart see salt hormone affect way heart function . These test last approximately five hour discharge around 2:00 PM . For next five day , place high salt diet . During five day , eat food , investigator give supplement eat meal . After five day high salt diet , morning second admission hospital , ask begin final 24-hour urine collection . That morning , require come Clinical Research Center one-hour test check body correct salt balance . You return even inpatient Clinical Research Center admit final study occur next morning . The study do low salt study repeat high salt study . You discharge around 2:00 p.m . This study determine salt-sensitive . In addition , investigator hope learn hormone regulate blood pressure gene responsible regulate hormone . You place back initial blood pressure medication ( ) return regular physician care . The investigator provide clinically relevant information physician .</brief_summary>
