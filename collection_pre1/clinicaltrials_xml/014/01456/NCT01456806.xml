	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate effect system intervention ( data recording procedure complete coverage medication supply ) without physician and/or patient education , upon psychological , clinical , metabolic therapeutic indicator cost care people type 2 diabetes . Design : Randomized 2x2 design ; sample size determine consider change haemoglobin A1c ( primary outcome variable ) use two-sided test 5 % level significance , 80 % power use paired t-test . Sample size increase 25 % account non-independence patient drop-out . Setting : Primary care level city Corrientes , Argentina involvement three Argentinean health subsectors ( public health , social security private , prepaid system ) . Participants : 36 general practitioner 468 adult ( 62-71 % woman , mean age 62 year ) type 2 diabetes . Patients participate physician ( nine group ) , randomly select assign one four group ( 117 patient ) : control , provider education , patient education , provider/patient education . Intervention : Structured group education programme deliver provider and/or people type 2 diabetes trained professional ; identical system intervention apply four group . Main outcome measure : Body mass index , blood pressure , fast glucose , haemoglobin A1c level , lipid profile , drug consumption , resource use , patient well ( WHO-5 questionnaire Lowe score ) , baseline 42 month every 6 month interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study protocol evaluate approved external ethical committee ; patient give inform consent participate study accord guideline International Conference Harmonisation WHO good clinical practice standard . The study design previously describe detail.30 Briefly , investigator implement randomized 2x2 design address effectiveness different education strategy involve health provider people diabetes ) . Sample size : determination four group , investigator consider change haemoglobin A1c ( baseline end study ) primary outcome variable . This do use two-sided test 5 % level significance 80 % power use paired t-test . The sample size increase 25 % account non-independence dropout , result number provider patient list table 1 . Educational strategy The investigator use Diabetes Training Course Physicians Diabetes Structured Education Courses People T2DM , whose characteristic usefulness previously report . Data collection Patients ' clinical , psychological , biochemical , therapeutic economic data PRODIACOR record use Physician Data Form , Annual Bi-annual Clinical Record Form Feedback Report Form . The investigator develop software compare first two mention form generates Biannual Feedback Report physicians patient ; compare value record haemoglobin A1c , serum lipid blood pressure , goal propose parameter accord international standard . It also include recommendation appropriate treatment achieve therapeutic goals.31 Additionally , investigator use Patient Questionnaire , base one previously use Diabetes Advantage Program ( DAP ) include question disease , WHO-5 well-being questionnaire . Data collection complete Personalized Checkbook , tool initially develop PROPAT study , whose aim content previously describe . It serve order procedure , consultation , laboratory test , prescription drug strip glucose self-monitoring , record communicate result , payment voucher item . Study Data management The Local Coordinator ( city Corrientes ) together Central Cordinating Center ( CENEXA ) , oversaw education course overall trial maintain periodic contact participate physician . Performance physicians patient monitor regular interval ( 6 month ) whole study period . Every physician visit twice year physician monitor assess quality data recorded.30 Participating physician collect patientsÂ´ data , send Local Coordinator control completeness forward Central Coordinating Centre . Resource utilization cost The data record include direct medical item use patient ascribed programme , obtain checkbook utilization cost record participate health coverage entity . Utilization classify five group : ) hospitalization , ii ) drug supply , iii ) diagnostic test , iv ) special study , v ) physician office visit . Drugs identify generic commercial name correspond presentation . Their cost assess retail price publish Alfabeta.net adjust July 2004 use health chapter local Consumer Price Index . Estimated drug cost haemoglobin A1c reduction experience treatment group use construct marginal figure cost-consequence ratio . For purpose , investigator calculate ratio figure experimental group , i.e. , investigator express total drug cost associate 1 % haemoglobin A1c decrease 10 mm Hg systolic blood pressure 10 mg/dL triglyceride level . The investigator currently estimate cost educational intervention , namely , physical human resource involve management administrative activity programme . Statistical analysis To estimate effect different educational intervention test , intention treat analysis use . Initial univariate difference among group quantitative data analyze one-way ANOVA ( Bonferroni post hoc test ) . Factorial ANOVA two-way ANOVA model ( Bonferroni post hoc test ) use assess difference among group along study . ANOVA also use explore initial vs. end-of-study difference among quantitative data . Differences among qualitative measure explore Chi-squared ( Yates correct ) . P value less 0.05 consider significant ( two tail ) . Missing data strategy apply primary endpoint last observation carry forward complete case analysis . Both strategy compare evaluate impact miss data efficacy analysis primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
