	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) auto-immune neurodegenerative disease affect 400,000 individual United States , 2.5 million worldwide ( www.nationalmssociety.org ) . The main pathogenic mechanism MS involve inflammatory condition damage myelin central nervous system ( CNS ) , result axonal damage neurological impairment , often lead severe disability . MS one common cause neurological disability young middle-aged adult individual , tremendous physical , psychological social impact patient ' life . MS complex disease diagnose McDonald criterion different clinical pathological phenotype . Several form MS describe : Relapsing-Remitting ( RRMS ) , Secondary-Progressive MS ( SPMS ) , Progressive-Relapsing MS ( PRMS ) , Primary-Progressive MS ( PPMS ) . Glatiramer Acetate ( GA ) Beta-Interferons ( Î²-IFNs ) well establish first-line immunomodulating treatment option relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) excellent safety profile . The mechanisms action GA IFNs different . It well known general Disease-Modifying Treatments ( DMTs ) reduce relapse rate half multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient receive DMT , little effect rest . It speculate response beta-interferon GA may genetic basis . As Axtell RC et al . indicated experimental autoimmune encephalomyeilits ( EAE ) mouse cause TH1 cell generally respond well interferon-beta , EAE cause TH17 cell get bad interferon-beta . Autoimmune disease extreme situation autoimmune response overshoot go control . The extreme degenerative disorder , autoimmune response strong enough effective protection , degeneration therefore continue . GA immunomodulator may provide properly regulate immune suppression ( case autoimmune disease ) properly regulate immune activation ( case neurodegenerative disease ) . Autoimmune condition cluster family high risk multiple sclerosis general population suggest disease might arise background generalized susceptibility autoimmunity . Occurrence psoriasis , autoimmune thyroiditis , vasculitis , rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma , lupus see commonly MS patient . Many patient initially get start beta-IFNs , usually well . According Investigator 's USC MS Comprehensive Care Center experience , autoimmune co-morbidity associate MS serve biological marker predict good response GA unfavorable response IFNs .</detailed_description>
