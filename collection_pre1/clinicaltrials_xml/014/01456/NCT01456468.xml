	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether combination UDCA ATRA take 3 month improve laboratory test liver bile duct inflammation patient Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) . Our hypothesis combination medication improve liver inflammatory test patient , specifically reduction alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) least 30 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Ursodeoxycholic Acid ( UDCA ) All-Trans Retinoic Acid ( ATRA ) Treatment Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients PSC often ongoing inflammation fibrosis ( scar ) along length bile duct , eventually involve liver lead cirrhosis ( severe scarring ) , severe infection ( cholangitis ) , bile duct cancer death . Although many patient treat UDCA , experience improvement liver test relief symptom , medical treatment date find produce long-term improvement inflammation scarring , improve survival . For reason , great need identify new medication effective treatment PSC . Recent work animal research group Yale University School Medicine show combination UDCA ATRA produce significant improvement liver scar inflammation animal bile duct disease similar see PSC . This improvement include lowering level bile acid , harmful liver , lower inflammation liver tissue animal . The benefit see study great animal receive combination UDCA ATRA compare animal receive either medicine alone . The medication ATRA relate vitamin A , use many year topical medication treatment skin condition acne psoriasis . It also use nearly 20 year oral medicine treatment form blood cancer ( acute promyelocytic leukemia ) , give 90 day time . ATRA show produce remission leukemia currently standard treatment patient specific condition . ATRA use routinely care patient liver bile duct disease . Based benefit observe treatment ATRA UDCA animal study , investigator plan study combination patient PSC believe may effective regimen patient condition . The investigator check blood test liver bile duct , , treatment order look change liver test would due medication combination . Therefore , goal study study change liver test patient PSC take combination UDCA ATRA 90 day , compare level begin study end study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis PSC least 6 month , make clinical evaluation addition one following : prior endoscopic retrograde cholangiography ( ERC ) , magnetic resonance cholangiography ( MRC , also term MRI/MRCP ) liver biopsy . Progressing disease stable disease persistent elevation AP despite treatment UDCA ( 15 mg/kg/day ) least 6 month . Measures progress disease : 1 . Cholangitis within past 12 month . 2 . Presence progression biliary abnormality MRI/MRC . 3 . Elevated liver test ( alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ) . Age 18 80 . Pregnancy plan pregnancy study period within 6 month study completion . Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 3 high cardiac disease , hyperlipidemia , hypertriglyceridemia , hepatic injury , adverse event relate administration UDCA ATRA . Prior intolerance UDCA ATRA ( related oral vitamin A compound ) . Evidence decompensated cirrhosis within past 6 month ( i.e . variceal bleeding , uncontrolled ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , jaundice ) . Estimated need liver transplantation within 1 year . Any evidence hepatocellular carcinoma , cholangiocarcinoma , malignancy .</criteria>
