	<brief_title>Long-term Study Alogliptin Add-on Rapid-Acting Insulin Secretagogues Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One alogliptin 25 mg tablet orally administer daily breakfast 52 week . The dose alogliptin adjust accord severity participant 's renal dysfunction base serum creatinine ( SCr ) level . Participants moderate renal dysfunction ( SCr , &gt; 1.4 - ≤2.4 mg/dL men &gt; 1.2 - ≤ 2.0 mg/dL woman ) receive alogliptin 12.5 mg tablet .</detailed_description>
