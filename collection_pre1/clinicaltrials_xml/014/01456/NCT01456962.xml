	<brief_summary>Increases cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) + T cell blood well document human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individual start antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , increase CD4+ T cell cervix variable fully understood . Although amount HIV vagina decline parallel plasma antiretroviral therapy HIV start , HIV still detect frequently cervical sample woman undetectable plasma viral load , suggest low level viral replication female vaginal tract could lead inflammation incomplete increase CD4+ T cell . Two class HIV medication , nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor substantially low female genital tract compare plasma , whereas concentration another class , nucleos ( ) ide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor similar high find plasma . Thus , many widely use first-line three drug HIV therapy achieve high concentration two medication female genital tract . Importantly , recent development raltegravir ( RAL ) , achieve concentration female genital tract high plasma , ART regimens deliver high concentration 3 antiretroviral drug female genital tract available . The investigator hypothesize cervical CD4+ T cell reconstitution well inflammatory marker lower HIV-infected woman HIV-therapy include tenofovir ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) RAL versus ritonavir ( RIT ) -boosted atazanavir ( ATZ ) , due therapeutic concentration 3 versus 2 antiretroviral drug female genital tract .</brief_summary>
