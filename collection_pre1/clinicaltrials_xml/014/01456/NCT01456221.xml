	<brief_title>Intervention Study With Omega-3 Fatty Acids Weight Loss Insulin Resistance Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In 2006 , prevalence overweight obesity combine scholar adolescent Mexico 26 % 31 % respectively , represent double report year 2000 . Together increments obesity rate , observe similar increase incidence metabolic condition insulin resistance ( IR ) . In simplistic manner , seem link obesity IR chronic inflammatory status adipose tissue-derived inflammatory molecule interfere uptake fatty acid glucose peripheral tissue . On hand , accept long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) omega-3 exhibit anti-inflammatory property . In addition , also demonstrate beneficial effect exert fatty acid insulin sensitivity , stabilize weight lose achieve hypocaloric diet . At present , prevalence overweight obesity combine range 41-43 % adolescent population attend four area influence Mexican Institute Social Security ( IMSS ) Mexico City . Interventions address improve nutritional status group age expect impact risk IR associate co-morbidities . Objective : To evaluate impact supplementation LCPUFA omega-3 , together dietary strategy , obesity insulin resistance sample obese adolescent attend IMSS . Methods : In randomized clinical design , 300 obese individual , 12-18 year old , select . At selection , individual randomly assign receive daily capsule 1.1 g LCPUFA omega-3 three mo together hypocaloric diet follow WHO recommendation ( D+O3 ) , receive daily capsule 1.0 g sunflower oil similar diet ( P+D ) . After randomization , dietary information ( 24h-recall FFQ ) , anthropometric measurement , peripheral blood sample , obtain . Blood sample use determine fast plasma glucose insulin , erythrocytes fatty acid profile ; determination repeat three six mo follow-up . Anthropometry 24 h-recalls repeat monthly . For follow-up , studied subject evaluate monthly deliver capsule check dietary adherence . Treatments administer three month follow-up continue throughout six month . At end follow-up expect D+O3 group present : ) high decrease mean weight BMI , b ) great decrease mean fast insulin concentration , HOMA index , IR frequency , c ) long duration weight lose . Statistical analysis : Student paired-t test use inter intra group comparison respectively . Logistic regression model repeat measure analysis conduct evaluate effect treatment , adjust diet weight loss , well confounders puberty treatment adherence . Infrastructure : The Unit Research Medical Nutrition owe equipment need conduct laboratory determination propose research , well personnel qualify conduct , monitor , analyze evaluate data field investigation , specially related obesity IR .</detailed_description>
