	<detailed_description>This uncontrolled , randomize , parallel-group , open-label phase I trial patient advance epithelial ovarian cancer . Patients randomized treatment group A weekly administration versus treatment group B bi-weekly administration . Patients treatment group receive maximum eight injection administer one one week eight time treatment group A fortnight eight time treatment group B . The treatment complete within seven week Arm A within 14 week Arm B . Independently treatment arm assign , patient follow period cover total 12 19 week disease progression . Safety parameter ( primary objective ) efficacy parameter ( secondary objective ) record . Upon completion treatment , one follow-up visit take place week 12 ( group A , ) 19 ( group B , ) . To protect patient ' safety , first six patient treat described : - The first patient hospitalize keep medical observation 72h administration first second dose investigational product ; - After observational period 3 day follow second dose first patient , second third patient administer first dose investigational product , hospitalize keep medical observation 72h . The two patient treat simultaneously consecutively ; - After observational period 3 day second dose first three patient , interim safety report send Ethics Committee ; - Additionally next three patient hospitalize , administer first dose vaccine keep medical observation 72h .
