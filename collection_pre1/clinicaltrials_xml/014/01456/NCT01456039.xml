	<brief_title>A Japanese Phase 1/2 Study Assess Efficacy , Safety Pharmacokinetics Romidepsin Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma ( PTCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 , non-randomized , open-label , single-arm trial two phase . The first phase 3 + 3 dose escalation phase determine recommend dose treating patient Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma ( PTCL ) Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma ( CTCL ) base assessment Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) .The second phase ass efficacy recommend dose measure objective response [ Complete Response ( CR ) , Unconfirmed Complete Response ( CR ( u ) ) Partial Response ( PR ) ] determine best overall response patient . Phase 1 enroll maximum 12 patient Phase 2 enroll approximately 40 patient</detailed_description>
