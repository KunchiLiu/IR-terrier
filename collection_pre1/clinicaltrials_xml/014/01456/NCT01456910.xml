	<brief_summary>Resistance exercise ( RE ) propose possible strategy prevention rehabilitation disease . The increase muscle strength ability perform task day-to-day work environment well-characterized benefit type training . The literature investigate effectiveness RE human , yet study conduct intellectual disability ( ID ) . It known sedentary lifestyle contributes development cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes , hypertension , arthritis , stress , depression , difficulty socializing , stigma discrimination . In particular , ID less active likely develop secondary disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim correlate peak torque work task performance ( WTP ) application resistance training program ( RTP ) , consist 40 session , twice week last 90 minute session . The sample constitute 40 individual , select survey record file Parents Friends Exceptional Children Federal District/Brazil Association ( APAE/DF ) , take consideration follow criterion : insert Professional Education Labor Program ( PELP ) APAE/DF , age 14 36 year active labor , show physical disability , cardiac problem , wish inform study voluntarily sign Free Informed Term Consent tutor . Although participant resident various city Federal District , possible avoid selection bias , since sample select single institution , limit , thus , generalization result . After perform pre-testing peak torque , Biodex System3Pro Dynamometer , WTP 800m , climb stair labor skill ( decorate two table 4 people , separate one meter , lunch 2 tablecloth , 8 plate , 8 fork , 8 knife 8 glass ) , participant randomly assign experimental group - G1 ( 20 participant ) control - G2 ( 20 participant ) , match accord age , sex per capita income , order form group similar characteristic . The G1 group participate RTP number eight , four upper limb four low limb . In order avoid confound bias , participant G2 group , along tutor , instructed continue daily activity normally participate RTP , well G1 also instruct participate physical activity . The first Monthly cycle ( two week ) develop order familiarize participant equipment learn perform exercise , avoid , thus , evaluation bias . Subsequently , apply test one maximum repetition - 1MR , elaborate spreadsheet individual training participant . The second , third fourth Monthly cycle develop accord spreadsheet elaborate timeline orientation instructor , duly inform . After four month intervention , 40 participant reassess .
