	<detailed_description>It difficult majority case estimate correct intra-operative mass fluid therapy patient und need high degree clinical experience . Among circumstance problem surgery ( kind surgery , length time , bleed , loss liquid via wound ) kind anesthesia , also concomitant disease patient relevant action anesthetist . These concomitant disease correct detect deduce correspond consequence call likewise high clinical experience . Furthermore , pre-operative fasting important fact . Considering influence factor anesthetist tend rather apply much volume surgery , follow much problem PACU / intensive care unit . However , much volume correct patient kind surgery ? How could investigators estimate really intra vessel volume deficit ? Which available parameter helpful , monitor useful ? These question confront daily every anesthetist . Monitoring clinical `` traditional '' factor diuresis , blood pressure und heart rate experience inexactly . Actually exist expert uniform opinion kind amount fluid administration , apply , well adequate monitoring . The central venous pressure , commonly use parameter , fall behind . Cardiac filling pressure correlate bad filling volume unsuitable parameter fluid therapy . It seem dynamic parameter stroke volume ( SV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) good marker . SV SVV could measure usual invasive blood pressure via LiDCO- FloTrac-Monitoring . In study investigator would show , necessary optimize process already anesthetic ambulance , evaluate patient concomitant disease correctly follow improvement intra-operative process . With help questionnaire good structure classified cardiac risk patient accordance actually ACC / AHA guideline ( 8 ) . Depending surgery risk , development intra-operative monitoring happen standardize preoperatively ( NIBP vs. IBP vs. SVV via FlowTrac LiDCO ) . The intra-operative fluid regime perform group NIBP IBP basis standard operating procedure ( SOP ) well group SVV basis targeted-volume protocol . There lot surgery increase fluid turnover increase risk cardiac complication . This demonstrate study limit kind surgery orthopedic operation different requirement intra-operative volume . Hypothesis The daily challenge anesthetic correctly estimate volume status surgery . Multiple factor concomitant disease , pre-operative fluid fasting , anesthesia well circumstance surgery inclusive bleeding risk important influence follow difficult peri-operative management . The aim study improvement peri-operative fluid management due process optimisation already anesthetic ambulance include cardiac risk factor patient follow intra-operative fluid protocol . Primary outcome parameter administer fluid volume ( include blood transfusion ) , secondary measure amount blood loss , postoperatively frequency PONV , delir well PACU ICU stay . The investigator believe investigator could reduce intra-operative fluid volume well blood loss due process optimization follow increase patient satisfaction . Furthermore , investigator could possibly reduce PACU ICU stay .</detailed_description>
