Teach-to-Goal ( TTG ) education employ instruction follow patient `` teach-back , '' repeat cycle learn assessment skill , i.e . respiratory inhaler technique , master . By contrast , Brief Intervention ( BI ) education consist provide patient verbal write instruction skill , i.e. , respiratory inhaler technique . The investigator hypothesize hospital-based TTG compare BI increase patient 's ability learn respiratory inhaler technique .

	<detailed_description>Respiratory inhaler often use incorrectly hospitalize patient asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . As mainstay bronchodilator anti-inflammatory therapy patient , implication difficulty self-management patient risk under-treatment bad health outcome . Several factor think contribute poor self-management skill , particularly inadequate patient education healthcare encounter inadequate patient health literacy ( HL ; ability understand use healthcare instruction ) . Inadequate HL patient asthma lead bad knowledge medication general inhaler technique specifically , patient inadequate HL likely hospitalize . As result , national international guideline asthma COPD recommend patient education improve self-management skill regard use respiratory inhaler assess patient comprehension point care , include hospital . However , effective strategy instruct patient respiratory inhaler use hospital setting unclear , particularly population enrich inadequate HL . Teach-to-goal ( TTG ) method patient instruction employ repeated round teach assessment patient comprehension mastery confirm . Our preliminary data hospitalize patient suggest TTG may particularly powerful method teach high-risk population use respiratory inhaler correctly , include patient inadequate HL . However , TTG likely resource-intensive ( personnel train time ) approach use everyday clinical setting ( usual care ) . Further , relative magnitude effectiveness TTG compare less resource-intensive method patient comprehension health outcome know . As healthcare resource limit , empiric data comparative effectiveness TTG alternate approach patient education need . Therefore pilot comparative effectiveness study compare TTG approach versus brief intervention ( BI ) patient hospitalize asthma COPD evaluate feasibility conduct randomized clinical trial two educational intervention population collect preliminary estimate relative benefit TTG vs. BI . These data help inform design subsequent large study comparative effectiveness . The primary research goal evaluate feasibility conduct randomized clinical trial two different strategy teach respiratory inhaler use determine preliminary estimate effect size intervention ; specifically , investigator assess recruitment retention rate , pilot test case report study procedure evaluate resource ( staff &amp; investigator time , cost patient incentive study material ) need perform trial . These data inform subsequent study provide important information regard feasibility , effect size sample calculation preliminary data secure funding development research . The Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate feasibility enrol randomize patient educational intervention teach appropriate respiratory inhaler technique . Specific Aim 2 : To obtain preliminary estimate effect size TTG vs. BI order determine necessary sample size large comparative effectiveness study design improve health outcome .</detailed_description>
