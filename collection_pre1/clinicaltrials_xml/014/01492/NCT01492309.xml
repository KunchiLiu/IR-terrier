	<detailed_description>We hypothesize decline Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HDRS-17 ) score begin end treatment . We expect decrease significantly great subject receive active transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) compare receive placebo TMS . Treatment response define great 50 % reduction HDRS-17 score . We also hypothesize level Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) , protein think regulate mood cognitive functioning , increase subject respond TMS treatment . We expect BDNF level increase great equal 20 % respond TMS . As previously state , TMS response define significant decrease ( 50 % great ) HDRS-17 baseline end treatment .</detailed_description>
