	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study collect information long-term safety gene transfer therapy . This study also design create database medical information patient receive gene transfer therapy , order researcher track review long-term safety effect ( good bad ) gene transfer therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Follow-Up Recipient Gene Transfer Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures Years 1-5 : If agree take part study , come clinic study visit year Years 1-5 . It choice whether visit regular local doctor study doctor MD Anderson . ( If visit regular local doctor , need test result blood sample mail study staff . ) You receive reminder phone call year , time schedule visit . At visit , follow procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-4 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You fill questionnaire asks medical history ( general health , status medical condition , illness hospitalization may occur ) . It take 15-30 minute complete . - You ask change contact information . - If necessary check status disease , scan ( x-rays and/or compute tomography [ CT ] scan ) and/or additional routine blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) . Study Procedures Years 6-15 : Once year Years 6-15 , research staff contact . Either phone , email , mail ( usually mail , enclosed questionnaire ) , ask medical history ( include child since infusion ) whether change contact information . The phone call questionnaire take 15-30 minute time . Results Study Testing : If test perform study suggest may medical condition and/or side effect likely relate gene transfer therapy , study doctor contact . You receive referral case would like seek medical care condition and/or side effect . You and/or insurance provider responsible cost CT scan x-ray may need study . Study Database : Your medical information collect study store research database MD Anderson use future research relate safety effect gene transfer therapy . Your data give code number . No identify information directly link data . Only researcher authorized personnel charge database access code number able link data . This allow medical information relate data update need . Other researcher use data able link data . Changes Parent/Guardian Contact : If young 18 year old joining study turn 18 study , start , research staff contact directly study instead parent/guardian . However , would prefer parent/guardian still main contact person , please tell study staff . Length Study Participation : After 15 year , participation study unless FDA decide follow-up must continue . This investigational study . Up 130 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
