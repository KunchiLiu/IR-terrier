	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Antioxidant Effects Resveratrol Healthy Adults .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect resveratrol human still well define . The number study resveratrol increase extraordinarily since 1997 , anticancer effect report . However , study in-vitro animal study . Preclinical observation human suggest resveratrol safe potential treatment obesity insulin resistance human . In particular , improve insulin sensitivity , might due resveratrol-induced decrease oxidative stress lead efficient insulin signal via Akt pathway . Studies toxicity resveratrol human demonstrate compound well tolerated adverse effect find high dosage ( 5g/day ) . Resveratrol available people over-the-counter health food store internet dietary supplement . In human , resveratrol efficiently absorb oral administration ; however , rapid phase II metabolism drastically limit plasma bio-availability . The high concentration resveratrol colorectal tissue , excess required activity vitro , support colon target organ . The efficacy resveratrol tissue may largely dependent whether metabolite significant activity able regenerate resveratrol either locally systemically ( e.g . metabolite , mainly sulfate-conjugated resveratrol , show biological effect cellular model ) . There study evaluate anti-inflammatory property resveratrol human . An extract Polygonum Cuspidatum contain resveratrol give 6-weeks 10 healthy subject able significantly suppress plasma concentration inflammatory cytokine ( C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α ) . Similarly , nutritional supplement contain resveratrol play acute antioxidant antiinflammatory effect postprandial state high-fat , high-carbohydrate meal 10 healthy female . The anti-inflammatory antioxidant effect resveratrol may particularly interesting smoker . Resveratrol increase NO bioavailability inhibition cyclooxygenase 5-lipoxygenase activity Cox-1 prevents vascular leucocyte migration damage organ decrease expression endothelial vascular adhesion molecule pro-inflammatory gene . The inflammatory response induce oxidize LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ) partially avoid addition reveratrol author conclude could affect vascular inflammation or/and injury antioxidant , also modulator inflammatory redox signal pathway . However , currently publish demonstration therapeutic protective effect resveratrol appropriately design clinical trial .</detailed_description>
