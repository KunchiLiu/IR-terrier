	<brief_summary>Total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ) effective procedure reduce pain improve function patient disable osteoarthritis ( OA ) hip knee . However , invasive procedure , TJA associate certain risk substantial cost . Since indication TJA heavily dependent patient ' quality life expectation . TJA utilization rate vary widely throughout United States , see 'preference-sensitive ' procedure . Early evidence suggest share decision making ( SDM ) strategy effective enhance patient decision quality , degree treatment decision reflect preference fully inform patient , especially preference-sensitive procedure like TJA . Despite advantage , however , SDM embrace widely adopt orthopaedics . To investigate limited uptake , investigator propose series evaluation individual-level strategy . The investigator innovative unique contribution approach patient , surgeon healthcare purchaser symmetric equally valid concern benefit cost associate SDM . The investigator overall objective facilitate wider dissemination SDM strategies orthopaedic practice . The specific aim project ass , SDM strategy , impact key patient , surgeon , healthcare purchaser priority ; By achieve aim project produce new intervention incentive disseminate SDM endorse feasible acceptable coalition patient , surgeon , purchaser . The investigator plan evaluation include randomize controlled trial evaluate impact SDM outcomes interest patient , surgeon , purchaser .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose RCT base non-randomized pilot study conduct UCSF include 115 patient referred evaluation hip knee OA . The result pilot study suggest DESI 's associate great patient knowledge , high decision quality , high patient surgeon satisfaction , substantial impact length office visit treatment decision . As pilot study , RCT intervention include package decision communication aid show prior study increase patient knowledge , question-asking , information recall . The intervention include digital video disc booklet produce Foundation Informed Medical Decision Making Health Dialog ; question-prompting phone call train health coach ; audio-recordings patient-surgeon consultation ; copy surgeon 's dictated note . The control arm consist usual care . Our primary outcome proportion patient arrive informed decision first visit . This outcome interest patient , surgeon healthcare purchaser , value efficiency quality delivery care . Our hypothesis high proportion patient intervention group arrive inform decision first visit , result knowledgeable prepared visit , thus conserve resource advance quality . Secondary outcomes interest include treatment decision ( e.g. , surgical vs. non-surgical ) ; patient provider satisfaction ; length office visit ; adherence treatment recommendation . We assess whether patient inform use survey instrument test 19 consensus `` key fact '' develop FIMDM base evidence expert opinion . We measure whether patient arrive decision use Stage Decision Making instrument . We administer instrument immediately patient 's first consultation surgeon .</detailed_description>
