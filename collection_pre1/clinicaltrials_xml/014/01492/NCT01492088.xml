	<brief_title>Study Brentuximab Vedotin ( SGN-35 ) Pediatric Participants With Relapsed Refractory Systemic Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call brentuximab vedotin . Brentuximab vedotin test treat people relapse refractory anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( sALCL ) Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . This study look maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase 2 dose pharmacokinetics brentuximab vedotin along overall response people take brentuximab vedotin . The study enrol 36 patient . In phase 1 portion study , 12 participant enrol receive brentuximab vedotin 1.4-1.8 mg/kg , 30-minute IV infusion , Day 1 every 21-day cycle , evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( 7 cycle ) . Once maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase 2 dose pharmacokinetics brentuximab vedotin reach , participant enrol diagnosis two phase 2 study arm : relapse refractory sALCL relapse refractory HL receive brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg 30-minute IV Day 1 every 21-day cycle 20 cycle . This multicenter trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 4.5 year . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone every 12 week 12 month end treatment ( EOT ) progression free survival every 6 month death , study closure , 2 year enrollment last participant overall survival .</detailed_description>
