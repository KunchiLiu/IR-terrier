	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluation clinical profile depression HCV patient ( newly diagnose treatment na√Øve ) , individual , 24 week begin IFN+Ribavirin therapeutic ( n=100 ) . To characterize depression associate HCV without interferon ( IFN ) , investigator use clinical , behavioral , biochemical genetic marker , distinguish different symptomatologic dimension . The control group compose 100 individual Major Depression diagnosis , general population , investigator try study incidence depression general population , characterize clinical profile patient HCV ( IFN+Ribavirin ) compare major depression . Thus , investigator total 300 evaluation 200 individual , 100 group , consider clinical group evaluate therapeutic re-evaluated 24 week begin . Hypotheses 1 . Depression individual affect HCV associate genetic vulnerability . 2 . Genetic vulnerability increase risk depression IFN therapeutic use . 3 . Depression associate infection HCV present symptomatological profile different general depression , maintain IFN therapeutic . 4 . A high state depression begin treatment , treat , risk factor abandon therapeutic . 5 . When compare gender , woman present severe symptomatological profile men .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 3 % world population ( 170 million people ) infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . In Portugal , estimate 150.000 case , 10 % confirm diagnosis . The disease 's potential evolution towards chronicity , hepatic cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma , make main indicator liver transplant . Besides natural history disease burden cause economy , individual frequently present neuropsychiatric symptom like fatigue , anxiety , depression cognitive disorder . Among , depression stand enormous impact individual society . Reaching high 15 % , second prevailing disease world 2020 , accord WHO prediction . Regarding neuropsychiatric symptom , one identify two distinctive pattern relation HCV infection . On one hand , individual chronic hepatitis C high prevalence psychiatric disorder , include depression . On hand , individual psychiatric record present high HCV infection rate average population . A combined therapeutic pegylated interferon ( IFN ) ribavirin use patient standard treatment , prove fundamental consensual intervention favorable change natural history disease . However , treatment associate high number adverse reaction like : `` influenza-like '' symptom , irritability , insomnia , fatigue loss appetite . Apart , neuropsychiatric symptom ( specially depression , sometimes suicidal ideation ) , among common secondary effect therapeutic IFN , one main cause patient interrupt treatment . It noteworthy , certain extent , psychopathologic symptom ( depression , cognitive disorder ) may associate HCV infection , even without interferon treatment , may relate direct HCV neurotoxicity . This symptomatology negatively affect individual 's perceive quality life , general functioning , work capacity , overall well-being quality life . Furthermore , therapeutic use HCV treatment associate impairment dimension . Over last year , increase research mechanisms likely responsible serious collateral effect associate therapeutic , specially cognitive disorder depression case . IFN induces change endocrine function ( hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ) neurotransmission activity ( specially serotonin dopamine ) . The mechanism depression induce IFN still research , likely , multifactorial . Several study suggest imbalance Th1 Th2 cytokine pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine may important role modulation cellular response brain psychological stress psychological disorder . A recent study , agreement grow literature relation inflammatory cytokine serotonin pathway ( 5-HT ) , show IFN affect expression serotonergic 1A receptor ( 5-HT1A ) , consistent observe depressed individual . IFN also reduce level peripheric tryptophan , effect correlate depression . Several study meta-analysis implied polymorphism promotor region serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTT ) , call 5-HTTLPR , response treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patient major depression . In way , 5-HTTLPR seem associate high occurrence disease IFN treatment . This allude association exposition inflammatory cytokine ( IFN ) existence variability 5-HTTLPR major depression . The cytokine therapy model use study physiopathology depression induce cytokine . Here , worth distinguish two behavioral syndrome different phenomenology response capacity antidepressants patient become depressed cytokine . On one hand , mood cognitive syndrome , characterize typical depression symptom , like depressed mood , anxiety , irritability , memory attention disorder , usually develop first third month IFN treatment vulnerable patient . On hand , neurovegetative syndrome , manifest symptom fatigue , psychomotor slowness , anorexia change sleep pattern , develop relatively early ( two week treatment IFN ) , large number individual remain late stage treatment . In term response capacity antidepressant , mood cognitive syndrome good effectiveness pre-treated paroxetine ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) , whereas neurovegetative syndrome response . Thus , data suggests different physiopathological pathway may connect development specific symptomatic dimension , include mood/cognitive symptom versus neurovegetative symptom , context cytokine activation system . However , available literature HCV associate depression wide contradictive . For instance , percentages depression incidence population vary 15 % 60 % , depend many sample methodology use . This way , seem pertinent perform research project focus characterization depressive profile , clinical point view , also use biochemical genetics marker population . Thus , intention work pursue well understand neuropsychiatric symptom associate hepatitis C , depression particular . This way intend achieve relevant contributes , preventive therapeutic approach population .</detailed_description>
