	<brief_summary>Muscle mass normally maintain regulated balance process protein synthesis ( i.e . make new muscle protein ) protein breakdown ( break old muscle protein ) . Proteins compose amino acid know amino acid increase muscle protein synthesis . However , amino acid . Essential amino acid one must consume food , non-essential amino acid make body . Interestingly , essential amino acid require increase rate muscle protein synthesis . In addition , essential amino acid leucine appear particularly important regulate protein synthesis . However , leucine able increase protein synthesis entirely understood . Previously , show 20-25 g high-quality protein , find milk , appear amount protein maximize rate muscle protein synthesis perform bout resistance exercise . Thus , aim measure synthesis new muscle protein ingest follow : 1 . 25g whey protein 2 . 6.25g whey protein supplement leucine 3 . 6.25g whey protein supplement essential amino acid leucine Thus , measure muscle protein synthesis consumption beverage leg do exercise ( ie . rest leg ) leg do resistance exercise . We hypothesize 6.25g whey supplement leucine stimulate muscle protein synthesis effectively 25g whey , 6.25g whey supplement essential amino acid except whey less effective increase muscle protein synthesis . Whey protein dairy base protein find cow 's milk , thus drink glass milk consume whey protein . However use isolated form whey protein , mean remove milk . As mentioned previously , amino acid 'strung-together ' make protein . The 'essential ' amino acid must consume food body make , thus consume eat protein rich food like milk chicken .</brief_summary>
