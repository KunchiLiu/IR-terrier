	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Continuous Intermittent Intraabdominal Analgesia Using Local Anaesthetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open abdominal hysterectomy common procedure perform many benign malignant gynaecological disease associate moderate severe pain . Traditional method postoperative pain management include patient control intravenous analgesia ( PCA ) use morphine , epidural analgesia spinal analgesia opiate recently , even local aesthetic ( LA ) use intra-abdominally abdominal wall . Although epidural analgesia may consider gold standard pain relief follow abdominal surgery , recent publication past experience several year may question use invasive technique lower abdominal surgery . Thus , trend towards movement central block towards non-invasive method pain relief . PCA morphine commonly use management pain follow major surgery compare central block , advantage relatively safe , easy use associate high degree patient satisfaction . However , large dos morphine necessary ensure adequate postoperative analgesia mean side effect postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , tiredness , pruritus , headache constipation may major problem group patient . Therefore , alternative technique reduce morphine requirement increasingly use . These include use paracetamol , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) recently local anaesthetic ( LA ) . The latter find result morphine spar 30 - 40 % even reduction postoperative nausea ( PON ) . LA infuse intraperitoneally safe effective recent study show use 12.5 mg/h levobupivacaine could attain adequate analgesia . Thus , efficacy LA establish well dose . However , method administration LA intraperitoneally remain unclear . This study design primary aim study whether morphine consumption reduce postoperatively use patient-controlled administration system intraperitoneal LA compare continuous infusion , whether translates improve recovery parameter reduce side effect improve patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
