	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies show alcohol change amount many brain chemical . These change may relate continue drinking , crave alcohol , relapse . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) look brain area brain chemistry infusion alcohol . It also study change brain chemistry relate participant report feel drunk . Objectives : - To use magnetic resonance imaging measure effect alcohol brain chemistry Eligibility : - Individuals 21 45 year age . - Participants either light drinker ( 1 14 standard alcoholic drink per week ) heavy drinker ( 20 40 standard alcoholic drink per week ) . A standard drink 12-ounce beer , 4-ounce glass wine , shot liquor . - Participants must able go without alcohol least 3 day row without severe withdrawal symptom . Design : - This study require two three outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . - Participants physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Participants ' alcohol drinking habit also assess determine whether may alcohol use disorder . - At first study visit , participant infusion alcohol . Blood sample collect measure blood alcohol level . - The MRI study visit take place 3 day first study visit . Participants MRI scan brain , follow infusion alcohol another scan . Blood sample collect . - Participants complete questionnaire infusion measure response alcohol . - Heavy drinker come clinic third visit discus possible future treatment risky behavior associate high level alcohol use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rodent study indicate modulation glutamatergic transmission contribute alcohol intoxication , reinforcement , tolerance , dependence . Brain microdialysis study general show acute alcohol suppresses glutamate release , alcohol withdrawal lead progressively increase extracellular level . Here , use acute , pharmacokinetically control alcohol challenge magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) study relationship brain alcohol glutamate concentration , correlate subjective feeling alcohol effect , measure Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ ) human subject . Correlations MRS data behavioral data Sensitivity Punishment Sensitivity Reward Questionnaire ( SPSRQ ) , Alcohol Sensitivity Questionnaire ( ASQ ) , Alcohol Effects Questionnaire ( AEFQ ) investigate . Healthy participant age 21-45 , without gross impairment judgment complicate psychiatric morbidity , receive preliminary infusion ensure adverse effect intravenous ( IV ) alcohol administration target BAC 0.08g/dl . In subsequent session , participant infuse alcohol target level scan MR scanner report subjective feeling use DEQ . Two group subject recruit : heavy drinker , classify female consume 15 plus drink per week male consume 20 plus drink per weekthose consume 20 40 drink per week , light drinker , classify female consume 1 10 drink per week male consume 1 14 drink per week . consume 1 14 drink per week . Central glutamate level quantify 3T use pharmacologically validate MRS methodology recently publish laboratory , relationship central alcohol level determine . Relationships also analyze DEQ score brain glutamate alcohol level . Finally , examine whether drink history ( i.e . light versus heavy drinker ) moderator relationship .</detailed_description>
