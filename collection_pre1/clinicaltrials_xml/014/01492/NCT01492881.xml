	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine multiple myeloma responds study drug vorinostat add standard treatment bortezomib pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) . After participant complete three drug combination multiple myeloma decrease , investigator also want learn effect ( good bad ) vorinostat bortezomib give people multiple myeloma longer period time . This type treatment call 'Maintenance Therapy ' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vorinostat With Doxil Bortezomib Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label single arm phase II trial vorinostat , bortezomib pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) follow vorinostat/bortezomib ( VB ) maintenance therapy patient relapse relapsed refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The primary hypothesis evaluate addition vorinostat PLD bortezomib backbone ( VB-PLD ) improve overall response rate ( ORR ) compare historical control PLD combination bortezomib . [ 1 ] We anticipate addition maintenance therapy improve ORR , may improve quality ( depth ) response progression free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary endpoint include PFS , high quality response rate ( good partial response ( VGPR ) + complete response ( CRs ) ) , duration remission ( DOR ) , quality life ( QOL ) , overall survival ( OS ) tolerability regimen patient relapse relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Relapsed relapsed refractory multiple myeloma : Relapsed MM define clinically active disease , patient receive one prior therapy , refractory recent treatment . ( Refractory prior treatment mean either progressive disease ( PD ) last prior therapy ; best response stable disease ( SD ) last prior therapy , PD within 60 day complete therapy ) . Relapsed refractory MM define relapsed disease , either becomes nonresponsive salvage therapy , progress within 60 day last therapy . 1 3 prior line therapy multiple myeloma ( single line treatment may consist 1 agent regimen .
