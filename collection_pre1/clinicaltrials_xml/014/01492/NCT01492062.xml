	<detailed_description>You invite participate research study development artificial pancreas . An artificial pancreas us program take information continuous blood glucose monitor use information tell insulin infusion pump much insulin deliver . The primary purpose study gain experience insulin delivery algorithms program program ( algorithm ) provide best regulation glucose level severe low blood glucose reaction blood glucose level generally 70 180 mg/dl . If system work properly , would need enter amount food eating , give insulin bolus , change basal rate wear device . You would need periodically check sure continuous glucose sensor function properly would need respond alarm might occur blood glucose high , low , glucose sensor pump work well . In addition investigator also gain experience insulin delivery algorithm minimize number glucose reading target . It intention modify algorithms study . In study investigator plan use commercially available insulin infusion pump ( OmniPod ) deliver lispro ( Humalog ) insulin . The investigator use Navigator continuous glucose sensor monitor glucose level ( sensor 1 ) provide glucose concentration close loop algorithm ( sensor 2 ) . The signal second Navigator send serial cable computer patient 's bedside . A control algorithm reside computer , amount insulin deliver transmit OmniPod Personal Device Manager send radiofrequency ( rf ) signal Omnipod pump reside subject . A health care provider attendance monitoring discrete blood glucose level ( YSI , GlucoScout , HemoCue measurement ) least every 30 minute . While Navigator Omnipod commercially available use study part investigational system hospital , investigational system one approve use FDA .</detailed_description>
