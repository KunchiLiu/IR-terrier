	<brief_summary>The incidence prostate cancer rise however number deaths prostate cancer stable . Meaning investigator diagnose many men prostate cancer impact life . The rise incidence mainly due increase use blood test Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) , screen test . Currently men suspect prostate cancer , identify raise PSA undergo trans-rectal ultrasound guide prostate biopsy ( TRUS biopsy ) . Many men test unnecessarily , 1/3 diagnosed prostate cancer . TRUS biopsy problematic random perform blind-the operator know cancer . Thus many low-risk cancer need treat diagnose many high risk cancer miss incorrectly classify . So , men negative biopsy low risk disease usually advise undergo another TRUS biopsy . An imaging test need could help men doctor decide whether biopsy true reflection inside prostate . The investigator test role two imaging test . The first , multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mp-MRI ) use magnetic signal body form image . The second , Prostate HistoScanningâ„¢ ( PHS ) use sound-waves . The investigator compare result test detail biopsy map-transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy ( currently best way find prostate require multiple biopsy take general anaesthetic . Eligible men undergo one TRUS biopsy advise test part standard care . They recruit UCLH referral letter clinic . The investigator aim see either test confidently rule presence clinically important disease .</brief_summary>
