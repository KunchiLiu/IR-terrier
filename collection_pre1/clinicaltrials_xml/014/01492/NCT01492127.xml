	<brief_summary>This study evaluate usefulness plasma proteasome level tumor marker hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) study variation follow curative treatment HCC . The hypothesis study plasma proteasome level decrease follow curative treatment , proteasome level could use marker detect early recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Proteasome Marker Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cirrhotic Patients Following Curative Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCC occur vast majority case context cirrhosis . Cirrhosis consider pre-cancerous state , justifies systematic screen HCC . Screening currently rely measurement alpha-foetoprotein ( AFP ) level ultrasound scan every 4 6 month . However , AFP poor sensitivity marker HCC . We recently show plasma proteasome level higher sensitivity HCC detect HCC cirrhotic patient , particularly tumor small still benefit curative treatment . The hypothesis study plasma proteasome level decrease follow curative treatment , proteasome level could use marker detect early recurrence . The goal study determine whether plasma proteasome level cirrhotic patient HCC decrease follow curative treatment ( radiofrequency , surgical resection , liver transplantation ) . Plasma proteasome level measure treatment 3 month treatment , subsequently 3 month interval one year follow treatment . The variation proteasome level compare AFP level . The sensitivity proteasome marker detect tumor recurrence evaluate , compare AFP .</detailed_description>
