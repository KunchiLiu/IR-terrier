	<detailed_description>This study compare epigenetic response healthy adult adult mild asthma diesel exhaust ozone exposure . Up fifty subject recruit healthy adult group thirty subject mild moderate asthmatic group . Both normal healthy group asthmatic group randomly expose clean air , diesel exhaust ozone exposure separate minimum two week follow bronchoscopy procedure 18-24 h post-exposure . Additionally , healthy group participate second arm study randomly expose clean air ozone separate minimum 2 week follow bronchoscopy procedure 1 h post-exposure . Responses primary interest include : 1 ) genetic epigenetic change 2 ) FEV1 measure spirometry , 3 ) lung inflammation cell change evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage . The performance test procedure consider essential conducting study . Exploratory endpoint include : blood CBC differential , fibrinogen platelet , change IL 6 IL 8 compare pre-exposure post-exposure value . Safety endpoint include comparison temperature , telemetry , respiratory rate , O2 saturation symptom score pre- post-exposure , 18-24 hour post-exposure . All medical procedure perform study personnel . Up additional 15 healthy subject recruit specifically expose ozone generate use heavy non-radioactive isotope oxygen ( 18O ) . There risk subject inhale isotope , naturally occur small concentration . We previously use 18Ozone study approve UNC IRB 1993 . The purpose exposure measure amount 18O label attach airway epithelial cell remove bronchoscopy thus calculate dose ozone cell receive . We draw small blood sample test perform subject routine spirometry ensure risk bronchoscopy . Physical Examination Day : Prior recruitment study , subject undergo physical exam . During visit , short review subject 's history perform vital sign , height weight assess ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , determine whether individual meet major exclusion criterion study . Up 50 ml blood may collect CBC/ differential , chemistry lipid panel . At time subject may undergo physical examination bronchoscopy may schedule one another time . In order participate study , subject ask : - Avoid smoke fumes 24 hour visit . - Avoid drinking alcohol 24 hour visit . - Avoid strenuous exercise 24 hour prior visit . - No caffeine 12 hour prior study visit . - Eat normal breakfast prior exposure bronchoscopy perform ~24 h post-exposure . - Not eat drink anything midnight night bronchoscopy . This include eat drink prior exposure bronchoscopy perform 1 h post-exposure . Training Day 1 . Eligible subject report research lab approximate 2-hour training session . 2 . Informed consent obtain . 3 . Assessment vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation 4 . Pregnancy test administer woman may child-bearing potential . 5 . Subjects trained cycle ergometer work load elicit minute ventilation normalize body surface 25L/m2/BSA determine . In subject 50 L/minute ( IE . VO2 approximately 2.0 L/m ) . A cycle ergometer work set 75 100 watt usually achieve physiological response 6 . Subjects perform spirometry . 7 . Subjects show chamber exposure take place . Study Arm 1 - Bronchoscopy ~24 h Post-Exposure ( Healthy &amp; Asthmatic Subjects ) Exposure Day 1 The subject expose ozone , diesel exhaust clean air three separate occasion , exposure separate minimum two week ( 2-visit exposure session ) . Subjects receive 18Ozone , expose ozone . 1 . Subjects ask arrive study site sooner 8 AM undergo assessment vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation , symptom score assessment . 2 . Pregnancy test administer woman may child-bearing potential . 3 . A telemetry unit attach cardiac monitoring . 4 . Subject fitted Holter monitor subject ask recline quiet dark place 30 minute . After approximately 20 minute time marker activate heart rate variability frequency reading take next 10 minute . The subject wear Holter monitor next 24 hr . Subjects expose 18Ozone fitted Holter . 5 . Venipuncture : Up 80 ml blood collect CBC/ differential , may use assessment coagulation function marker , phagocytic function , inflammation , cell surface marker . A portion sample may use RNA isolation microarray analysis DNA isolation genotyping purpose . Pre-exposure blood take subject expose 18Ozone 6 . Baseline Spirometry 7 . Exposure session : Exposure ozone , diesel exhaust clean air conduct exposure chamber EPA Human Studies Facility UNC campus . Each subject expose 0.3ppm ozone , diesel exhaust ( 300 ug/m3 ) clean air 2 hour . Subjects begin exercise exercise bike . Each exercise session consist 15 minute exercise interval level 25 L/m2/BSA follow 15 minute rest period . Minute ventilation may measure exercise period . Continuous heart rate rhythm , oxygen saturation , monitor use telemetry pulse oximetry respectively . Blood pressure may monitor intermittently . Subjects ask refrain prohibit use inhaled bronchodilator exposure ; medication use necessary subject instruct maintain consistent medication use across two exposure . The subject able end exposure exit chamber time . Indications terminate exposure include significant respiratory distress dyspnea , chest angina-like pain , significant cardiac arrhythmia , pallor , ataxia , great 5 point drop saturate oxygen ( drop low 89 % ) . They monitor continuously trained personnel physician call whenever subject undergoing procedure facility .

The medical station Human Studies Division include fully-equipped medical examination room , cardiac/respiratory emergency cart , subject recovery room , nurse 's station , wait room conference room . The facility staff qualified RNs , on-site physician available respond medical emergency timely manner . The exposure atmosphere approximately 40 + 10 % RH approximately 22 + 2 oC . The DE generate diesel generator use power load bank locate outside Human Studies Facility , subsequently introduce exposure chamber different dilution clean HEPA charcoal filter humidified air give chamber concentration 300 μg/m3 . The monitoring analyzer register concentration real time . Exposures terminate value ≥ 400 µg/m3 run exposure target 300 µg/m3 DE . This safety limit prevent inhalational exposure great 1080 µg , assume subject inhale 2.7 m3 120 min exposure . Levels carbon monoxide ( CO ) , oxides nitrogen ( NOx ; mainly NO , NO2 ) , keep 10 ppm CO , 15 ppm NO , 2.5 ppm NO2 exposure terminate . [ The OSHA 8 hr time-weighted average ( TWA ) substance : CO=50 ppm ; NO=25 ppm ; NO2=5 ppm ; Diesel fuel use study purchase commercial ultra low sulfur fuel . Subjects enter exposure chamber ( 6 ft x 6 ft x 8 ft ) . Particle mass measure real time . Particle size distribution may determine subject exposure regular interval ( e.g. , monthly ) show size distribution change radically . Filter sample also analyze chemical composition particle . Ozone exposure conduct ( 6 ft x 6 ft x 8 ft ) stainless steel chamber continuous supply exposure medium . Ozone monitor continuously . Immediately post exposure , subject undergo spirometry , Holter monitor frequency reading , symptom score assessment vital sign . 8 . Then , 80 ml blood collect CBC/ differential , assessment coagulation function , blood leukocyte phagocytic function , cytokine , cell surface marker RNA isolation microarray analysis . Subjects expose 18Ozone 20 ml blood remove analysis 18O tag present blood cell post exposure Spirometry measurement . 9 . Subjects expose 18Ozone bronchoscopy perform 1 hr post-exposure . Exposure 18Ozone undergoing bronchoscopy approximately one hour later increase risk subject . We complete two early study subject underwent bronchoscopy follow exposure concentration ozone high use study , encounter problem . Others also publish study subject expose ozone follow bronchoscopy one hour later 10 . Subjects assess discharged nursing staff .
