	<brief_title>Acetyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate therapeutic efficacy acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride ( ALC ) prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) patient recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect ALC chemotherapy-induced fatigue base upon Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -Fatigue scale . II . Evaluate effect ALC sensory peripheral neuropathy measure first 4 item FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) -Neurotoxicity ( Ntx ) subscale ( FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale ) . III . Evaluate effect ALC health-related quality life measure FACT-Ovarian ( O ) trial outcome index ( TOI ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan dosage paclitaxel ( &lt; 150 mg/m^2 v ≥ 150 mg/m^2 ) , age ( &lt; 60 year age vs ≥ 6 year age ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride ( ALC ) orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 ( chemotherapy treatment ) . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-21 ( chemotherapy treatment ) ( maximum 8 course ) . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also complete questionnaire comprise Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -Fatigue scale , FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity subscale ( FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale ) , FACT-Ovarian trial outcome index ( FACT-O TOI ) baseline , prior course 3 5 , within 4 week completion treatment , 3 month completion treatment .</detailed_description>
