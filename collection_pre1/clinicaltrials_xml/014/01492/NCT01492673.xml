	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad treatment new combination drug , cyclophosphamide , topotecan , bevacizumab patient cancer . The medication , cyclophosphamide topotecan , standard drug often use together treatment cancer child either Ewing 's sarcoma neuroblastoma . Bevacizumab experimental drug call antibody target protein important growth cancer cell call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF make tumor surround cell help make blood vessel need growth spread cancer cell body . The way bevacizumab work stop cancer cell make blood supply , cause tumor stop grow big spread . In adult clinical trial , bevacizumab show promising anti-cancer activity patient cancer colon/rectum ( colorectal ) breast . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient colorectal cancer cancer find child . Bevacizumab test early clinical study child show safe . Other goal study include research test design test follow change patient cancer : see body handle break bevacizumab ( pharmacokinetics ) , look change protein blood may affect way cancer respond combination ( angiogenic profile , angiogenesis associate serum biomarkers ) , look change gene may affect cancer respond treatment combination medication ( metabolic signature ) , monitor effect change way body grow develop bevacizumab give .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm relapsed/refractory Ewing 's sarcoma neuroblastoma . Patients must measurable disease . Patients diagnosis neuroblastoma MIBG avid disease permit enroll study . Patients must ≤ 21 year age time diagnosis Life expectancy ≥ 3 month Lansky Karnofsky performance ≥ 70 % Written inform consent Organ marrow function define follow : Hematologic function , follow Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/μL Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L ( without transfusion &lt; 14 day enrollment ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dl Renal function , follow : Serum creatinine ≤ ULN age . Refer Appendix H normal value serum creatinine child . If serum creatinine value , calculate creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR must ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 Urinary protein &lt; 2+ ( unless total quantitative protein &lt; 500 mg protein/day determine 24 H urine collection ) pediatric patient please refer CTCAE V4.0 value . Hepatic function , follow : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN institution ≤ 5x ULN institution clearly attributable liver metastasis Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dl . Coagulation : INR ≤ 1.5x ULN . Prior Treatment : Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiation therapy prior entry study . Patients must least one prior treatment regimen . Patients may receive treatment previously cyclophosphamide topotecan prior bevacizumab . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Two week must elapse since administration previous chemotherapy . Biologic agent : At least 2 week must elapse since completion therapy monoclonal antibody . Seven day must elapse since last dose retinoids Radiation therapy : For patient , ≥ 4 week must elapse local XRT ; ≥ 6 month must elapse prior radiation ≥ 50 % pelvis substantial bone marrow irradiation . Patients history prior radiation field include heart ( e.g . mantle ) exclude . Stem cell transplant : Patients undergo prior stem cell transplantation exclude study entry . At least 3 month must elapse since autologous allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Patients must evidence active graft versus host disease . Patients centrallylocated pulmonary mediastinal primary tumor metastases adjacent invade large blood vessel . Prior leave chest wall irradiation cumulative anthracycline dose great equal 300 mg/m2 , unless ejection fraction fraction shorten within normal institutional limit , case patient enrol . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure Life expectancy le 3 month Current , recent ( within 4 week first infusion study ) , plan participation experimental drug study Genentechsponsored bevacizumab cancer study Active second malignancy , superficial basal cell superficial squamous ( skin ) cell , carcinoma situ cervix within last five year History malignancy , except solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 3 year prior enrollment . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Uncontrolled hypertension ( sBP &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg , find two consecutive measurement separate one week period time despite adequate medical support ) . Prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior Day 3 . History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior Day 3 . Known CNS disease , except treat brain metastasis . Treated brain metastasis define evidence progression hemorrhage treatment ongoing requirement dexamethasone , ascertain clinical examination brain imaging ( MRI CT ) screen period . Anticonvulsants ( stable dose ) allow . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , radiosurgery ( RS ; Gamma Knife , LINAC , equivalent ) combination deem appropriate treating physician . Patients CNS metastasis treat neurosurgical resection brain biopsy perform within 3 month prior Day 3 exclude . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , require surgical repair recent peripheral arterial thrombosis ) within 6 month prior Day 3 . History hemoptysis ( ≥ 1/2 teaspoon bright red blood per episode ) within 1 month prior Day 3 . Evidence bleed diathesis significant coagulopathy ( absence therapeutic anticoagulation ) . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 3 anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . ( A major procedure constitute invasive procedure require general anesthetic support , hospitalization , supportive care laparotomy , laminectomy , etc . ) Core biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device , within 7 day prior Day 1 . ( Minor surgical procedure include minimally invasive procedure fine needle aspiration , core biopsy , etc require little supportive care exclude lumbar puncture bone marrow aspiration/biopsy . ) History abdominal fistula gastrointestinal perforation within 6 month prior Day 3 . Serious , nonhealing wound , active ulcer , untreated bone fracture . Thrombolytics treatment dose warfarin within 28 day initiate treatment . Patients require low dose warfarin central venous catheter patency allow enter dose &lt; 2 mg per day total AND International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 . Patients require treatment dos heparin reason . The use heparin flush maintenance central venous catheter permit Patients require aspirin &gt; 325 mg per day nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication know inhibit platelet function . Patients take cyclooxygenase2 inhibitor ( COX2 ) inhibitor allow enroll . History clinical evidence deep venous thrombosis include pulmonary embolus within 6 month treatment . Patients proteinuria &gt; 1+ urine dipstick UPC ratio ≥ 1.0 screening . If &gt; 1+ proteinuria detect surveillance , 24hour collection must perform eligibility desire .
