	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To assess Quality Life impact treatment ' side effect ( radical prostatectomy , external beam radiotherapy prostate brachytherapy ) patient localized prostate cancer short , mid long-term follow-up . Secondary Objectives : - To assess biochemical disease-free survival treatment risk group , mid long-term follow-up . - To assess overall survival treatment risk group , mid long-term follow-up . - To assess prostate cancer-specific survival treatment risk group , long-term follow-up . - To assess disease-free survival treatment risk group , long-term follow-up . - To assess perceived general health cancer-specific quality life treatment risk group , short , mid long-term follow-up . - To calculate resource use cost three primary treatment . - To assess preference direct indirect method . Outline : This prospective observational study cohort clinically localized prostate cancer treat either radical retropubic prostatectomy , three-dimensional external-beam radiotherapy , interstitial brachytherapy . Participants consecutively recruit 10 Spanish hospital department ( locate five autonomous community ) . Patients eligible inclusion stage T1 T2 , treat one participating center without previous prostate transurethral resection . Patients stag accord 1992 American Joint Committee Cancer clinical stag guideline use directed history physical examination . The decision regard treatment make jointly patient health professional . Demographic clinical characteristic baseline record clinical site include age , Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) , Gleason grading , prostate volume , risk group use neoadjuvant hormonal treatment . According tho national health guideline participant visited every 6-12 month treatment . Quality Life questionnaire administer centrally telephone interview treatment follow-up 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month treatment first year , annually 10 year , every 5 year thereafter . Quality Life evaluation gather use computer-assisted telephone administration include : ( 1 ) Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) , specifically design measure impact different treatment ; ( 2 ) SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire ; ( 3 ) Functional Assessment cancer Therapy , General Prostate specific ( FACT-G FACT-P , respectively ) ; ( 4 ) International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) ; ( 5 ) International Index Erectile Function ( IIES ) . A total 120 patient calculate required treatment group detect between-treatment group difference 5-points urinary irritative-obstructive score EPIC questionnaire give standard deviation 18.99 statistical power least 80 % significance level 5 % , expect loss follow-up 10 % . The analyst blind treatment assignation .</detailed_description>
