	<brief_summary>Patients schedule total knee replacement suitable sciatic nerve block randomize one 2 group . Group 1 nerve block perform use standard Pajunk block needle ultrasound guidance electrical nerve stimulation ( ENS ) , catheter placement also guide electrical nerve stimulation . Group 2 block perform use Sonoplex echogenic block needle echogenic catheter sit , ultrasound ( US ) guidance . Group 2 needle location aid ENS , ENS use catheter location . An observer blind needle type ass quality needle visualisation record US image take procedure , along adequacy spread local anesthetic . The primary outcome needle visibility , secondary outcome block success rate , block performance time , complication rate , number needle pass per block , adequacy spread local anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 70 patient ASA physical status 1 4 , schedule elective total knee arthroplasty deem suitable receive sciatic nerve block include study . They randomise one two group prior block procedure use close envelope system . Recruitment take place preoperative clinic . All block perform block room use standard monitoring , sterile precaution titrate intravenous sedation . Prior sciatic nerve block continuous femoral nerve block perform accord standard procedure . Once complete patient position sciatic nerve block . A preprocedural scan do per standard practice skin infiltrate 1 % lidocaine . The anaesthetist perform block aware study group allocation due requirement physically handle block needle , proceed position needle required location site facilitate catheter insertion , aid electrical nerve stimulation via needle . This record use ultrasound machine cineloop facility . If 6 pass operator unable either contact nerve accord ultrasound image elicit twitch response , procedure abandon consider failed block . In case analgesia cover periarticular infiltration opioids . During needle positioning , observer record number needle redirections require optimally locate needle , redirection define every movement follow withdrawal 2cm . The observer also record number skin puncture require arterial venous puncture . Group E block perform use echogenic needle , echogenic catheter place use ultrasound guidance . The catheter insert needle second anesthetist . This process continuously record use cineloop feature ultrasound machine . Once catheter deem appropriate position , local anaesthetic inject second anaesthetist observe disposition local anaesthetic perineurally short axis . This confirm long axis view nerve ( also record ) . Group S block perform standard needle catheter , guide electrical nerve stimulation . Acceptable muscle twitch response plantar- dorsiflexion , inversion eversion initial nerve current strength 0.5mA frequency 2Hz . If satisfactory motor response elicit , current increase stage 1.5mA . If response still elicit record catheter still use position deem satisfactory use colour Doppler - medley colour adjacent nerve injection agitate dextrose 5 % . Once catheter deem appropriate position , local anaesthetic inject second anaesthetist observe disposition local anaesthetic perineurally short axis . This confirm long axis view nerve ( also record ) . Once catheter sit use technique , bolus agitate 5 % dextrose inject catheter Doppler ultrasound use locate tissue inject fluid deposit . This also record subsequently assess . An assistant present block time two aspect procedure : 1 . Time first skin contact needle first muscle response nerve stimulation . This do day surgery block procedure desire muscle twitch elicit . 2 . Time first skin contact completion catheter insertion ( Block time ) .This do block procedure day surgery note Once catheter position assess total 20 millilitre 2 % mepivacaine inject via catheter group . Over subsequent 30 minute second blind observer take observation every 5 minute assess degree motor sensory block . The video record block procedure send along data collection form two co-investigators , independently assess following : 1 . At time nerve contact needle , assign rating visibility needle shaft tip accord follow scale : 1. visualise poorly visualise - needle tip/shaft isoechoic slightly echogenic background parenchyma . 2. tip shaft visualise difficulty - tip/shaft readily identify echogenic background parenchyma see entirety 3. excellent visibility shaft tip strongly echogenic relative tissue visualise entirety . 2 . Assign rating completion injection 3 . Judge whether circumferential longitudinal spread local anaesthetic either adequate inadequate . Following operation standard infusion 0.1 % ropivacaine 4cc/hr commence via sciatic catheter . Post operative care per standard practice institution . One week post operatively patient telephone home check persist neurological symptom .</detailed_description>
