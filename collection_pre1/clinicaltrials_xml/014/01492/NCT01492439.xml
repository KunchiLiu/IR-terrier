	<detailed_description>Cognitive remediation intervention find effective reduce degree cognitive problem experience person schizophrenia . Investigators propose project examine effectiveness cognitive remediation support education set George Brown College Toronto , Ontario . This study would build upon feasibility study investigator recently complete represent emerge line inquiry intervention increasingly test community rehabilitation setting . A large body research demonstrate frequency significant cognitive challenge among person schizophrenia ability level , average , 1-2 standard deviation low general population area problem solving , attention , memory . These cognitive difficulty show marked impact psychosocial functioning , make difficult succeed many people schizophrenia work school setting . Work school require people prioritize , multi-task , sustain attention prolong period , remember material present wide range format . Given central role education employment recovery person mental illness , crucial effort make address cognitive difficulty ensure provision spectrum service good address quality life person schizophrenia . In past 10 year rapidly increase interest development mean impact cognitive deficit might ameliorate person psychosis . This body work concentrate largely upon cognitive remediation strategy . Cognitive remediation ( CR ) refers intervention range cognitive task repeatedly practice improve attention , memory , problem solve ability . Most intervention computer base , typically set form game , others paper-and-pencil . Randomized control trial consistently show beneficial impact CR intervention cognitive psychosocial functioning . Key finding include moderate effect size improvement attention , memory , problem solving , modest impact psychosocial function good finding CR pair supported employment . Less substantive impact psychosis symptomatology find , though self-esteem find improve . Furthermore , gain observe CR find sustain period 2 year post-intervention . Examination non-specific effect also indicate CR lead significant benefit task capture non-specific factor ( e.g. , computer skill train ) . In general clear shift cognitive remediation literature towards examine functional outcome pair cognitive remediation psychosocial intervention . This movement likely build criticism narrow scope earlier cognitive remediation study look pre post measure cognitive function questionable association 'real world ' outcome . In response criticism Susan McGurk pioneer examination CR support employment context . To date , however , outside work present investigator , study CR support education setting find . Research area important ( 1 ) education core component recovery people severe mental illness ( 2 ) cognitive impairment markedly limit people might achieve education setting . Given repeat call literature randomize trial cognitive remediation interest outcomes partner psychosocial rehabilitation , study address follow question : 'Does cognitive remediation adjunct support education result improve cognitive functioning , symptom , performance academic domain person psychosis ? ' This study employ randomize design term 1 student psychosis randomize either support education alone ( SE ; n = 8 ) support education cognitive remediation combine ( SE + CR ; n = 8 ) . The cognitive remediation intervention two component complete course 10 week within academic term . First , participant take part total 20 , 45 minute computer-based cognitive exercise session hold twice weekly basis use COGPACK . This computer program facilitate practice across broad range cognitive function , include attention concentration , psychomotor speed , learn memory , executive function . Participants receive assistance complete cognitive exercise give suggestion strategy improve performance challenging exercise . In addition computer exercise , participant take part 10 weekly group discussion session ( approximately 60 minute duration ) . Topics group include role cognitive factor academic performance , development compensatory strategy deal challenge academic setting ( e.g. , study strategy , mean address attention difficulty ) , strategies manage difficulty anxiety psychosis symptoms school setting . Evaluations complete pre-intervention/control , post-intervention/control 3 month follow group . The sequence complete course 5 academic term allow total sample 64 ( term 1 student enrol every academic term 5th term would follow-up 4th group ) . Each trial within academic term 10 week length allow pre post test take place within term .</detailed_description>
