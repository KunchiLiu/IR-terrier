	<brief_title>Cholecystectomy First vs Sequential Common Bile Duct Imaging + Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergency cholecystectomy nowadays accept surgical procedure routinely perform worldwide . The main indication include acute cholecystitis , cholangitis gallstone migration . Abnormal liver function test upon admission suspicion accompany common bile duct ( CBD ) stone delay surgical management due need investigation and/or therapeutic maneuver . These procedure include magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography ( MRCP ) , endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography ( ERCP ) . While useful detect exclude potential CBD stone , procedure include inherent risk , delay surgical treatment , extend hospital stay result , increase overall medical cost . They also potentially increase morbidity and/or mortality delay emergency cholecystectomy ( due presence local inflammation adherence ) . Finally , center perform systematic intra-operative cholangiogram cholecystectomy ( laparoscopic open ) , allow accurate assessment CBD potentially lead subsequent exploration ( endoscopic surgical ) . In study , investigator assess follow hypothesis : - Patients SUSPICION gallstone migration ( without associate cholecystitis ) undergo emergency cholecystectomy intra-operative cholangiogram ( IOC ) first - `` Cholecystectomy first '' strategy decrease length hospital stay morbidity/mortality decrease number unnecessary EUS , MRCP ERCP therefore decrease overall number complication , well decrease complication relate delayed cholecystectomy ( increased adherence due inflammation , especially case associate cholecystitis , increase risk bleeding , CBD lesion , duodenal lesion , gastric lesion , colon lesion , gallbladder perforation intra-abdominal gallstone spillage potential</detailed_description>
