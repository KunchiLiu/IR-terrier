	<brief_summary>The overall objective study test effectiveness systems-level approach primary care recognition management PTSD depression military health system . More specifically , investigator test effectiveness telephone care management preference-based step PTSD/depression care -- STepped Enhancement PTSD Services Using Primary Care ( STEPS UP ) -- compare Optimized Usual Care ( OUC ) . Primary Hypothesis 1 : Active duty primary care patient PTSD , depression , randomly assign STEPS UP report significantly great reduction PTSD depression symptom severity compare participant assign OUC 12-months follow-up . Hypothesis 2 : Active duty primary care patient either PTSD , depression , randomly assign STEPS UP report significantly great improvement somatic symptom severity , alcohol use , mental health functioning , work functioning compare participant assign OUC 12-months follow-up .

	<brief_title>Stepped Enhancement PTSD Services Using Primary Care ( STEPS UP ) : A Randomized Effectiveness Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant prevalence posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) depression among veteran return Operations Iraq Afghanistan , less half service member refer specialty mental health assessment actually receive specialty mental health treatment . Systematic knowledge regard access care quality care deliver civilian , VA , military facility encounter barrier difficulty scant , recent policy review strongly question availability quality care . These problem access quality major , overarch problem war-related PTSD research . There scientifically tested strategy non-military setting mental disorder improve access quality care ; unfortunately , strategy unstudied military health system PTSD depression . These strategy include care manager coordination ( connect patient , provider , specialist ) , collaborative care ( negotiate patient-provider problem definition , monitor status treatment response , self-management support , telehealth sustain follow-up ) , step care ( logical , patient-centered guideline-concordant treatment sequence ) . This study aim fill gap evaluate systems-level strategy military set PTSD depression . The purpose STEPS UP ( STepped Enhancement PTSD Services Using Primary Care ) trial compare centralize telephonic care management preference-based step PTSD depression care optimize usual care . We hypothesize STEPS UP intervention lead improvement ( 1 ) PTSD depression symptom severity ( primary hypothesis ) ; ( 2 ) somatic symptom severity , alcohol use , mental health functioning , work functioning ; ( 3 ) cost cost-effectiveness . We hypothesize qualitative data obtain interview show ( 4 ) patient , family member , participate clinician find STEPS-UP intervention acceptable , effective , satisfy approach deliver receive PTSD depression care . STEPS-UP six-site , two-parallel arm ( N = 666 ) randomize control effectiveness trial 3-month , 6-month , 12-month follow-up comparing centralize telephonic stepped-care management optimize usual PTSD depression care . In addition exist PTSD depression treatment option , STEPS UP include web-based cognitive behavioral self-management , telephone cognitive-behavioral therapy , continuous RN nurse care management , computer-automated care management support .

If effective , expect STEPS UP increase percentage military personnel unmet PTSD- depression-related health care need get timely , effective , efficient PTSD depression care . Our real-world primary care effectiveness emphasis prevent Institute Medicine 's call `` 15 year science service gap . '' If successful , STEPS UP could roll immediately , reinforce facilitate pathway PTSD depression recovery .</detailed_description>
