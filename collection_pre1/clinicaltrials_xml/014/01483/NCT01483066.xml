	<brief_summary>The currently hold belief total knee replacement ( TKR ) require restoration overall limb alignment coincide mechanical limb axis . To align knee implant mechanical axis , rod use orient cut guide mechanical axis define center femoral head talus . Standard surgical technique typically involve femoral tibial rod cut block facilitate intraoperative alignment initial femoral tibia bone cut . This approach method use traditional TriathlonÒ instrumentation . The Patient Specific Cutting Guides design offer alternative alignment rod . ShapeMatch Technology place plastic cut guide end femur tibia , cut automatically default mechanical axis , rather attempt recreate patient 's anatomic alignment . The surgeon ass implant placement adjust necessary pre-operative planning . Thus , Patient Specific Cutting Guides give surgeon well control placement implant . This study prospective , randomized evaluation ShapeMatch Technology primary TKR consecutive series patient meet eligibility criterion . The clinical study accompany formal cost-effectiveness analysis one-year outcome . One half case enrol receive Triathlon® Cruciate Retaining Total Knee System ( Triathlon® CR ) procedure use patient-specific cut guide design reproduce natural kinematic alignment knee . The half case receive Triathlon® CR device procedure use traditional instrumentation , without navigation , design produce neutral mechanical alignment . Subjects evaluate use validated measure within 3 month prior surgery 6 week , 3 month , 1 2 year postoperatively . Primary Hypothesis : The investigator expect ShapeMatch Technology cost-effective usual care . Secondary Hypotheses : The investigator expect ShapeMatch Technology result improve clinical outcome relative usual care three month postoperatively . The investigator expect ShapeMatch Technology result similar clinical outcome relative usual care two-years postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient male nonpregnant female age 18 80 year age time study device implantation . Patient primary diagnosis NonInflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease ( NIDJD ) . Patient candidate primary total knee replacement ( TKR ) . Patient willing able comply preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) requirement , postoperative schedule clinical radiographic evaluation rehabilitation . Patient Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ≥ 40 . Patient varus valgus deformity great 10 degree flexion contracture great 20o . Patient active suspect latent infection affect joint time study device implantation . Patient receive orthopaedic surgical intervention low extremity within past year expect require orthopaedic surgical intervention low extremity , TKR enrol study , within next year . Patient require bilateral TKR , contralateral partial TKR TKR . Patient implanted device would incompatible MRI procedure . Patient neuromuscular neurosensory deficiency , limit ability evaluate safety efficacy device . Patient diagnose systemic disease ( e.g . Lupus Erythematosus ) metabolic disorder ( e.g . Paget 's Disease ) lead progressive bone deterioration . Patient immunologically suppress receive steroid excess normal physiological requirement ( e.g . &gt; 30 day ) . Patient require revision surgery previously implant total knee replacement knee fusion affect joint . Patient known sensitivity device material .</criteria>
