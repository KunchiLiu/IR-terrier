	<brief_summary>Lung Cancer ( LC ) , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) breast cancer ( BC ) major killer oncology , account 40 % cancer death . Although progress make last year , unfortunately patient metastatic disease obtain definitive cure . A recent hypothesis cancer driven small subpopulation cell call `` cancer stem cell '' ( CSCs ) `` tumor initiating cell '' unlimited proliferative potential ability reproduce original human tumor experimental animal model . These cell think responsible development tumor represent cell population able sustain tumor growth progression . Therefore , CSCs represent elective target new targeted therapy , endow high selective toxicity towards tumor harmless towards normal cell . Current technology allow u isolate expand vitro CSCs tumor specimen , test sensitivity different anticancer drug short period time . Therefore , potential opportunity identify LC , CRC BC CSCs.This prospective study assess feasibility CSCS isolation LC , CRC BC . Patients previously perform diagnosis LC , colon cancer breast cancer standard therapy option , Karnofsky performance status 100 % tumor tissue available consider eligible study . Tumor tissue collect study entry , i.e tissue obtain diagnostic therapeutical procedure , like surgery biopsy purpose protocol . In vitro tumor sensitivity chemotherapy drug test tumor cell culture per patient . Drugs combination consider effective kill â‰¥ 60 % tumor stem cell vitro test . By use cancer sphere investigator also generate orthotopic xenograft model recapitulate parental tumor behaviour , include aggressive feature invasiveness potential . Orthotopic injection technique assess 5 weeks-old NOD/SCID mouse</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Patients LC , CRC BC good performance status tumor tissue available , failure conventional therapy without possibility treat therapy proven efficacy , include study . Initial patient characterization include detail information follow item : gender , age , clinical history , co-morbidity , physical examination , blood cell count , complete blood analysis liver renal function , coagulation , serological tumor marker , tumor location stage , tumor mass , metastasis . LC , CRC BC CSCs identification Isolation characterization CSCs make start sample tumor tissue obtain patient LC , CRC BC . Tumor tissue collect study entry , i.e tissue obtain diagnostic therapeutical procedure , like surgery biopsy purpose protocol.The surgical sample collect classify accord specific histological characteristic tumor . From sample , mean enzymatic mechanical procedure , CSCs obtain cultivate adequate culture medium subsequently use biochemical molecular study . Each sample associate patient history surgical time appropriate follow-up program consist periodic clinical instrumental control order assign prognostic value biological characteristic CSCs . Stem cell derive select epithelial tumor undergo analysis surface intracellular marker order provide definitive characterization cellular phenotype . Stem cell derive lung cancer , CRC BC identify subset tumor cell positive marker CD133 . Tumor specimens wash several time leave night DMEM : F12 medium supplement high dos Penicillin/Streptomycin Fungizone order avoid contamination . Tissue dissociation carry enzymatic digestion recover cell culture serum-free medium contain 25 microg/ml insulin , 100 microg/ml apo-transferrin , 10 microg/ml putrescine , 0.03 mM sodium selenite , 20nM progesterone , 0.6 % glucose , 5mM hepes , 0.1 % sodium bicarbonate , 0.4 % BSA , glutamine antibiotic , dissolve DMEM-F12 medium supplement 20 ng/ml EGF 10 ng/ml bFGF . Flasks non-treated tissue culture use order reduce cell adherence favourite growth undifferentiated tumour-spheres . These culture condition select immature tumour cell , non malignant differentiate cell negatively select assessed CSCs different origin . Surviving immature tumor cell slowly proliferate give rise tumour cell aggregate , `` sphere '' , within 1-2 month culture condition . Sphere-forming cell expand mechanical dissociation sphere , follow re-plating single cell residual small cell aggregate complete fresh medium . Differentiation LC , CRC BC sphere-forming cell obtain cell culture specific medium ( Cambrex ) . Phenotype LC , CRC BC spheres differentiate progeny analyze flow cytometric analysis immunofluorescence . In particular stem cell marker CD133 , CD34 BCRP1 analyze . Successively , cancer sphere analyze order define status pathway involve process proliferation , self-renewal survival . In particular , tumor-specific analysis carry investigate activity possible alteration pathway responsible stem cell homeostasis global analysis ( phosphoproteomic signal transduction analysis , innovative drug testing , analysis process metastatization vivo ) aim provide overall picture activation state key cellular pathway . Preclinical model By use cancer spheres investigator generate orthotopic xenograft model recapitulate parental tumor behaviour , include aggressive feature invasiveness potential . Orthotopic injection technique assess 5 weeks-old NOD/SCID mouse . The injection procedure do support dissect microscope . After anesthetization , 200 500 cancer sphere cell , modify order express bioluminescent protein luciferase inject use Hamilton syringe 32-gauge needle . Metastatic local tumor compare stem cell content phenotypic analysis growth rate , stem cell property include clonogenic capacity soft agar limit dilution assay . Infection CSCs lentiviral vector , cod green fluorescent ( GFP ) , well luciferase reporter protein , allow CSCs track vivo . Particularly , amphotropic packaging cell line 293T transfected calcium-phosphate/chloroquine method . Culture supernatant contain viral particle collect 48h transfection . Infection perform culture target cell 0.45 microm filter viral supernatant 3h CO2 incubator . Two infection cycle perform infect cell . Microscopic evaluation GFP expression viral packaging target cell perform direct observation cell use reversed fluorescence microscope equip FITC filter . After infection , cell transduce luciferase sort flow cytometry obtain pure mark population . The local tumor invasiveness development monitor whole-body imaging technique , permit detect , localize quantify dynamically optical signal - bioluminescence - non invasive localization mark cell population . This procedure perform use Photon imager vivo image system ( Biospace Lab ) , assist recent software acquisition image analysis . Thanks system , recently acquire laboratory characterize high sensitivity 20 ms temporal resolution , investigator analyze non anesthetize freely move animal . The bioluminescence signal acquire simultaneously standard video animal . Once investigator sure success tumour grow , mouse sacrifice . Tumor remove morphological characterization phosphoproteomic analysis . This latter perform reverse phase protein microarray , allow achievement high degree sensitivity , precision linearity , make possible quantify phosphorylated status signal protein immature differentiate lung cancer cell . This system provide information specific molecular pathway involve LC , CRC BC cell growth spread . Tumor sensitivity anti-tumoral agent To selectively discriminate effective therapeutic compound putative tumor invasion initiate cell , investigator measure viability clonogenic LC , CRC BC exposure several anti-tumor drug differentially combine singular time point 96 hour .</detailed_description>
