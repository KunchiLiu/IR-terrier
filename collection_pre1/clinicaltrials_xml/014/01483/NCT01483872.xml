	<brief_summary>Aim : To conduct randomize , double-blinded , control phase II trial investigate use catheter lock solution consist N-acetylcysteine , tigecycline heparin , addition systemic antibiotic , treatment hemodialysis catheter-associated bacteremia via catheter-salvage strategy . The investigator plan randomize 102 patient hemodialysis catheter-associated bacteremia one two treatment arm . All patient receive systemic antibiotic treatment infection . Additionally , patient randomize interventional arm also receive catheter lock solution consist N-acetylcysteine , tigecycline heparin 2 week aim salvage catheter . The control arm receive anticoagulant solution catheter lock standard care - either heparin citrate ( depend agent standard care particular patient ) . The main outcome interest successful treatment define resolution current episode bacteremia well lack recurrent bacteremia within 90 day follow-up .</brief_summary>
