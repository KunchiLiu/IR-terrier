	<detailed_description>Conservative treatment preferred treatment midshaft clavicle fracture , whether fracture displace undisplaced . The background come two large study do 60 . C. Neer ( 2235 patient ) C. R Rowe ( 566 patient ) show respectively 1960 1968 patient clavicle fracture , even large fracture displacement , symptom fracture heal incidence non-union 1 % . Both study criticize include child adolescent heal potential significantly large adult result base purely surgical radiologic endpoint patient-reported outcome measurement use . Clavicle fracture frequent represent somewhere 5 10 % fracture see orthopedics . The incidence clavicle fracture somewhere 29 64 per 100000 per year . Fracture clavicle frequently occur young men male-to-female distribution 2.6:1 . Between 70 80 % clavicle fracture localize middle part clavicle , fracture displace . Midshaft clavicle fracture define fracture middle 3/5 part clavicle ( lateral boundary vertical line base processus coracoideus medial border vertical line middle first rib ) . Recent study show high incidence non-union , especially fracture displace shorten two cm occurs . Malunion , previously consider clinically important , appear several resent study associate profound symptomatic shoulder problem . One study report 30 % displaced clavicle fracture heal malunion result profound symptom discomfort shoulder . Surgery , plate osteosynthesis displace clavicle fracture , several study associate high success rate complication . To date one randomize trial compare conservative treatment plate osteosynthesis displace midshaft fracture do . This Canadian multi-center study 2007 , 132 patient randomize ( 111 patient complete ) , conclude small significant improvement functional outcome patient fracture osteosynthesised compare conservative treatment . This study recommend surgery displace fracture active patient . Recently two review article question result Canadian study unclear whether poor functional outcome conservatively treat group due non-unions group ( 14.2 % ) . They conclude estimate risk overtreatment numbers-needed-to-treat analysis estimate 9 operation need prevent 1 non-union . Though evidence surgical intervention conservative treatment displace midshaft clavicle fracture still controversial seem patient treat primary operative intervention . Because tendency need validate whether operative intervention clavicle plate superior compare conservative treatment displace midshaft clavicle fracture .</detailed_description>
