	<brief_summary>Subject : Evaluation impact obesity surgery sleeve gastrectomy intestinal iron absorption morbid obese subject . Control intestinal absorption iron mediate hepcidin , express adipose tissue expression increase morbidly obese subject . The work hypothesis increase could explain high prevalence systemic iron depletion observe obese patient . Main objective : Assess impact decrease fat mass induce surgery obese patient intestinal absorption iron ( evaluate measure expression iron transporter duodenum )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Rationale high prevalence iron deficiency anemia recently characterize obese patient may relate stage low-grade systemic inflammation associate obesity Control intestinal absorption iron mediate hepcidin , small circulate peptide synthesize primarily liver . synthesis hepcidin increase inflammatory condition recently show hepcidin express adipose tissue expression increase morbidly obese subject The work hypothesis increase could explain high prevalence systemic iron depletion observe patient . use bariatric surgery become common treat severe obesity ( BMI 35 kg / m2 ) The sleeve gastrectomy , recently introduce , involve significant weight loss . however , impact iron deficiency anemia know main objective Assess impact decrease fat mass induce surgery obese patient intestinal absorption iron ( evaluate measure expression iron transporter duodenum Secondary objective : - Assess impact decrease fat mass induce surgery obese patient concentration circulate hepcidin . - To study correlation level expression iron transporter duodenum plasma concentration circulate hepcidin - Search correlation level hepcidin expression subcutaneous adipose tissue visceral concentration plasma hepcidin surgery . - Evaluate effect sleeve gastrectomy surgery haematological iron status obese patient . Selection criteria patient : Inclusion criterion : female subject , body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m2 ( &gt; 35 kg/m2 comorbidity ) justify obesity surgery , For indication obesity surgery laid , collective decision take consultation , part care different specialty ( physician , surgeon , psychiatrist ... ) Non-inclusion criterion strictly less age 18 year strictly great 60 year , history bariatric surgery stomach , hepatic cytolysis ( transaminases &gt; 3n ) cancer treatment ( radio chemotherapy treatment ) coefficient transferrin saturation &gt; 45 % ; know history follow : hematologic disease require transfusion , hemochromatosis , Wilson 's disease ( know interference metabolism iron copper ) , Chronic inflammation ; Patient receive medical examination ; Patient give informed consent writing , affiliate Patient Social Security CMU ( universal health coverage ) ( recipient beneficiary ) , know pregnancy Number need : 83 patient enrol Total duration study : 39 month Duration participation patient : 21 month Duration inclusion : 18 month Methods : Prospective open multicenter study cognitive . 4 visit plan part research specificity different center . Visit 1 : Presentation study obtain consent . Visit 2 : consultation implementation multidisciplinary assessment duodenal biopsy gastroscopy , additional laboratory test pregnancy test necessary . Visit 3 : surgery ( sleeve gastrectomy ) adipose tissue biopsy . Visit 4 : creation consultation multidisciplinary assessment duodenal biopsy gastroscopy additional laboratory test . Examinations require specifically research : duodenal biopsy , additional laboratory test , biopsy adipose tissue pregnancy test ( dipstick ) premenopausal woman ( contraceptive ) . Primary assessment criterion : The intestinal absorption iron assess level expression iron transporter ( DMT1 ferroportin ) mRNA ( messenger ribonucleic acid ) level RT-qPCR ( reverse transcription quantification polymerase chain reaction ) protein level Western blot . secondary assessment ( ) criterion ( ) The concentration hepcidin plasma measure ELISA adipose tissue , level hepcidin expression quantify RT-qPCR . The haematological ass presence anemia ( hemoglobin le 12g/dl ) micro macrocytic hemolytic / regenerative</detailed_description>
