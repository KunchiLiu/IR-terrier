	<brief_summary>This study design answer 3 primary research question : 1 . In adult low back pain , reduce SLR ROM ( Range Motion ) positive sensitize SLR ( Straight leg raise ) test , neurodynamic mobilization result great SLR ROM , pain reduction perceive improvement muscle stretch ? 2 . In adult low back pain , reduce SLR ROM negative sensitize SLR test , muscle stretch result great SLR ROM , pain reduction perceive improvement neurodynamic mobilization ? 3 . In adult low back reduce SLR , neurodynamic mobilization muscle stretch result great SLR ROM , pain reduction perceive improvement irrespective outcome SLR sensitization ? The research hypotheses threefold : 1 . Subjects determine nerve-related pain ROM restriction positive sensitized SLR test would benefit neurodynamic mobilization muscle stretch . 2 . Subjects determine muscle-related pain ROM restriction negative sensitized SLR test would benefit muscle stretch neurodynamic mobilization . 3 . Subjects would benefit muscle stretch neurodynamic mobilization match outcome SLR sensitization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subject sign inform consent evaluate inclusion study . Subjects meet inclusion criterion ask complete form ask question regard demographic , pain history symptomatology . The form also include numeric pain rating scale determine pain severity , standardized questionnaire commonly use back pain research ( i.e. , Modified Oswestry Disability Index ) . Subjects evaluate SLR range motion side least amount SLR range motion use bubble inclinometer . Subjects randomly assign receive treatment address hamstring length treatment address sciatic nerve restriction . A second researcher blind result data obtain pre-treatment administer treatment . Hamstring stretch consist position subject 's hip flexion knee extension , hold position 30 second . This treatment repeat 5 time . Nerve mobilization consist either momentarily position hip flexion , knee extension ankle dorsiflexion , move ankle dorsiflexion rate 1 - 2 movement per second ( theoretically , stretch nerve ) , move low leg first position hip extension ankle dorsiflexion , hip flexion ankle plantarflexion ( theoretically , glide nerve sheath ) . The choice technique make treat therapist . Both treatment take approximately 4 minute complete . Following intervention , subject re-evaluated SLR range motion use bubble inclinometer researcher collect pre-treatment data . During next visit physical therapy , researcher re-evaluate subject SLR range motion , previously describe ; pain , numeric pain rating scale .</detailed_description>
