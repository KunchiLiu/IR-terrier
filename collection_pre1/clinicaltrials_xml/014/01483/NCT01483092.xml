	<brief_summary>Prebiotics non-digestible food ingredient beneficially affect host selectively stimulating growth activity specie colon improve host health . Inulin-type fructans ( inulin oligofructose ) natural food ingredient prebiotic activity . Fermentation inulin oligofructose lactic acid produce bacteria result increase bacterial biomass production SCFA ( acetate , propionate butyrate ) , lactic acid gas CO2 H2 . They naturally present significant amount several vegetable garlic , artichoke , onion , asparagus , leek wheat ( 1-4 % ) . Based consumption data , daily intake inulin Europe vary 3.2 11.3g mainly wheat ( 2-7.8g/d ) . However , might change recently since inulin oligofructose use food industry either sucrose fat replacement due health benefit human host . Several human absorption study evaluate effect inulin/oligofructose mineral absorption . It show calcium magnesium absorption positively influence . Until , positive effect iron absorption show animal . The influence human iron absorption investigate twice . Both study report effect inulin/oligofructose iron absorption , likely due poorly conceive study design . The aim present study demonstrate inulin consumption several week lead enhance iron absorption human optimized condition .</brief_summary>
