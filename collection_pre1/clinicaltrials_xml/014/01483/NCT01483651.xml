	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test different level insulin block effect glucagon . Insulin hormone lower blood glucose . Glucagon raise blood glucose . Both natural hormone make people without diabetes . Sensor-based blood glucose control study do research group use glucagon small dos prevent hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) . However , sometimes glucagon work raise blood sugar . The investigator believe much insulin body . This study help determine different level insulin body affect ability glucagon raise blood sugar .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We investigator work development close loop ( artificial endocrine pancreas ) insulin glucagon infusion system since 2005 part Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Artificial Pancreas Consortium . As part study , give small dos glucagon prevent hypoglycemia . As assessed success failure glucagon administration study , find use glucagon reduce frequency hypoglycemia 75 % . However , fact approximately 25 % administration glucagon ineffective remains concern . The primary question address study , set low dose subcutaneous glucagon administration , plasma glucagon plasma insulin quantitatively interact ? In word , rate insulin administration increase , much glucagon necessary overcome effect insulin prevent hypoglycemia ? This study design address question . Subjects bring Legacy Hospital four 10 hour experiment four separate day . On study day , continuous infusion different rate IV Regular insulin order achieve different steady state free insulin level . At insulin level , four subcutaneous glucagon dos give . Octreotide infuse IV constant rate suppress endogenous production glucagon . A stable glucose isotope also infuse allow measurement hepatic glucose production glucose turnover . Arterialized venous blood glucose measure HemoCue Glucose 201 Analyzer .</detailed_description>
