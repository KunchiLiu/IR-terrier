	<brief_title>Vascular Cognitive Assessments Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility enrol woman receive adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer clinical trial assessment vascular function cognition adjuvant chemotherapy obtain pilot data outcome used future larger-scale trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate presence , duration , severity brain circulation change identify transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer . II . Assess change flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) aortic dilation occur adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer . III . Assess correlation presence brain circulation vascular change performance neuropsychological test Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Scale ( FACT-Cog ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo TCD examination include bilateral evaluation standard intracranial arterial segment include M1 M2 segment middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) , anterior cerebral artery ( ACA ) posterior ( PCA ) cerebral artery , via transtemporal acoustic window , internal carotid artery ( ICA ) siphon via transorbital approach , vertebral basilar artery ( proximal , mid , distal ) via suboccipital approach . Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . All test occur 21 day completion surgery 30 day prior adjuvant chemotherapy 20-60 day completion adjuvant chemotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
