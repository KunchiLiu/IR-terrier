	<brief_summary>There strong evidence patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) increase risk develop coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . This elevated risk independent classical risk factor smoke , obesity , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes hypertension . The risk CHD increase 1½-2 fold minor depression 3-4½ fold subject MDD . Put simply , relative risk develop CHD proportional severity depression . While mechanism increase cardiac risk attributable MDD known disturbance autonomic function likely play part . In untreated patient MDD ( underlie CHD ) investigator identify marked sympathetic nervous activation diminish heart rate variability ( HRV ) occur proportion ( approximately one third ) patient . Diminished HRV link increased incidence rate acute cardiac event condition hypertension , diabetes myocardial infarction . Importantly , whether treat depression actually improve risk : ( 1 ) CHD development ( 2 ) recurrence cardiac event patient exist CHD remain unknown . The investigator , others , provide grow body evidence link elevate sympathetic activity exaggerate sympathetic response stress early stage end organ dysfunction marker disease development . Of particular note , addition possible effect HRV association chronic sympathetic nervous activation : ( ) abnormal blood pressure regulation ( b ) development insulin resistance . The investigator therefore plan examine cardiovascular effect two different antidepressant medication , agomelatine escitalopram , patient MDD . In addition , investigator plan investigate effect two medication sympathetic nervous system activity , blood pressure , HRV , endothelial function , metabolic psychological effect . Findings study assist u identify biological correlate sympathetic nervous activation enable u : ( 1 ) identify potentially increased cardiac risk , ( 2 ) potentially implement additional therapeutic strategy order reduce cardiac risk . Indeed , know whether antidepressant treatment alone would sufficient reverse adverse effect sympathetic nervous activation . This study aim answer important clinical question .</brief_summary>
