	<brief_summary>The Accu-Chek DiaPort system enable continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion ( CIPII ) : , infusion insulin peritoneal cavity use Accu-Chek insulin pump infusion set . The Accu-Chek DiaPort consist metal body catheter place abdomen . The opening port raise surface skin 5 millimeter , flower-shaped plate place skin , provide stability port . The port design diabetic benefit fully subcutaneous insulin infusion . The primary objective study assess suitability Accu-Chek DiaPort perform continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery . The data collection focus condition tissue around port implantation , possible peritoneal reaction port system , peritoneal delivery insulin . Secondary objective assessment therapeutic performance successful implementation design requirement . In total 12 Patients participate open , mono-centre , single-arm , interventional clinical trial . The study last 9 month ( without run period 3 1 week ) separate two part . Phase I last 12 week . Phase II last 6 month end study . During study , seven visit plan . The screening visit take place 3 week study start . At implantation visit last 5 day port implant . After implantation insulin therapy adjust CIPII patient train handle daily care Accu-Chek DiaPort system . To check functionality system , first control visit take place 2 week second control visit 6 week implantation . At week 12 visit , important parameter collect phase I report . The following visit take place 6 9 month implantation .</brief_summary>
