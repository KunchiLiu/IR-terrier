	<brief_summary>Standard cardiac rehabilitation program ( sCRP ) aim improve risk factor heart disease high blood pressure , weight control , exercise diet order decrease chance heart problem future . These program decrease morbidity mortality face important challenge : 1 ) Long wait list participate program . For example , St. Paul 's Hospital intake capacity 480 patient per year . Patients usually wait one three month start program . 2 ) There vast heterogeneity patient within program , never experience heart problem already heart attack , chest pain stroke . Therefore , patient different medical problem receive treatment . 3 ) Facilities inconveniently locate lead transportation difficulty , 4 ) The program time consume class hold work time , 5 ) Shortly completion , patient seem lose gain program . These caveat need address improve efficacy , delivery capacity sCRP increase population patient heart disease . The investigator want compare reduce cardiac rehabilitation program ( rCRP ) standard cardiac rehabilitation program ( sCRP ) patient risk factor heart disease well patient already suffer condition , include high risk . The rCRP offer service sCRP ; difference number hospital base exercise session . While sCRP offer 32 hospital base supervised exercise session , rCRP offer 10 hospital base exercise session . The rCRP would 'middle road alternative program ' would benefit hospital base program flexibility home base intervention . The rCRP would offer alternative patient need constant supervision would allow sCRP health care team focus patient serious heart condition . The rCRP would unique intervention integrates less intensive cardiac rehabilitation pre-existing sCRP model . This alternative would help overcome caveat standard cardiac rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two group randomize control trial , non-inferiority design , rCRP ( intervention group ) compare sCRP ( control group ) . Eligible patient ask participate study cardiac rehabilitation program intake clinic . Consenting participant ask sign inform consent undergo baseline assessment . This assessment consist medical history , exercise capacity ( stress test ) , blood test , blood pressure , anthropometric measurement , lifestyle behaviour psychosocial measurement . The baseline assessment do participant start program . Consecutively , randomization take place stratify accord gender either sCRP rCRP . The assessment call exit assessment perform four six month baseline , cardiac rehabilitation program exit clinic ( program completion ) 16 20 month baseline ( one year follow-up cardiac rehabilitation program completion ) ass immediate sustainable effect , respectively . The following research question address : 1 . Is reduced cardiac rehabilitation program ( intervention group ) effective standard cardiac rehabilitation program ( control group ) improve exercise capacity ischemic heart disease risk factor program completion ( four six month baseline ) one year program completion ( 16 20 month baseline ) ? 2 . Will reduce cardiac rehabilitation program well adherence standard cardiac rehabilitation program ?</detailed_description>
