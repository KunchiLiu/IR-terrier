	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency associate unfavorable metabolic profile several observational study . However , influence vitamin D concentration postprandial glucose type 2 diabetes ( DM ) less study . The purpose study study effect vitamin D inadequacy postprandial glucose excursion metabolic responses patient type 2 DM . This cross-sectional study . About 150-180 patient screen serum level 25 ( OH ) D. A total 45 eligible patient group three group different vitamin D status : vitamin D deficiency , vitamin D insufficiency , control . The patient receive mixed meal test postprandial glucose excursion metabolic response . The investigator use statistical method assess difference post-challenge glucose metabolic response among three group patient . The investigator hope study explore relationship vitamin D glucose excursion patient type 2 DM .</brief_summary>

About 150-180 patient screen serum level 25 ( OH ) D. A total 45 eligible patient group three group different vitamin D status : vitamin D deficiency , vitamin D insufficiency , control . The patient receive mixed meal test postprandial glucose excursion metabolic response . Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) apply compare difference clinical characteristic among three group . Univariate analyse general linear model use compare difference meal-derived metabolic index among three group , show effect confound variable include age , sex , obesity , DM-related clinical parameter . Repeated-measures ANOVA use assess difference post-challenge glucose metabolic response meal test , without adjustment covariates . Pearson partial correlation procedure use test correlation 25 ( OH ) D clinical parameter include lipid profile , HbA1c , meal-derived metabolic index . Multiple linear regression model use attempt compare degree 25 ( OH ) D concentration associate meal-derived metabolic index patient . The investigator hope study explore relationship vitamin D glucose excursion patient type 2 DM .</detailed_description>
