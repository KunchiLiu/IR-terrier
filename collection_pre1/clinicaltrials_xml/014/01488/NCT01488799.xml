	<brief_summary>The current study examines whether change-readiness , consequently treatment outcome , enhance Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) add brief course Motivational Interviewing ( MI adapt anxiety , Westra &amp; Dozois , 2003 ) CBT motivation wane . 106 individual severe GAD randomly assign receive equal number session either MI CBT ( MI-CBT arm ) CBT alone ( CBT alone arm ) . It expect MI-CBT arm relative CBT alone arm show low level resistance CBT , high level homework compliance therapeutic alliance , good moment-to-moment interpersonal process , consequently superior outcome - post-treatment 6 12 month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study build finding clinical trial Westra , Arkowitz Dozois ( 2009 ) , aim : ( 1 ) provide powerful test value add MI CBT high severity GAD ( pilot data indicate individual severe GAD may preferentially benefit addition MI CBT ) , ( 2 ) employ treatment procedure generalizable clinical practice , ( 3 ) examine mechanism underlie additive treatment benefit . 106 individual principal diagnosis GAD high worry severity randomly assign receive either 4 session MI follow 11 session CBT ( MI-CBT arm ) 15 session CBT ( CBT alone arm ) . Both group also receive 2 follow-up CBT treatment session 1 3 month post-treatment . Each therapist deliver treatment component , treatment appear seamless client , therapist nest within treatment group control allegiance effect avoid cross-contamination therapy . In order increase generalizability clinical practice , CBT phase MI-CBT arm , therapists shift MI presence empirically derive marker resistance shift back CBT resistance diminish . In CBT alone arm therapist respond resistance use manualized recommendation derive lead CBT theorist management resistance . Anxiety relate symptom , motivation , treatment engagement assess various point treatment , 6 12 month post-treatment . A multi-method approach assessment use , include self-report , clinician-report , clinician-administered , observer-rated , interview-based measure . Importantly , include traditional outcome measure , also process measure ( e.g. , observer-coded interpersonal behavior , interview-based derivation client experience ) investigate possible mechanism underlie additive treatment benefit . In addition , therapy session videotape assessed independent raters protocol adherence . The specific hypothesis follow : Hypothesis 1 : Worry , Anxiety , &amp; Related Symptoms . The MI-CBT arm show great reduction worry , anxiety , relate symptom ( depression , disability , maladaptive belief worry , life satisfaction ) great percentage treatment responder ( use clinical significance criterion ) across treatment period follow-up ( FU ) , compare CBT alone arm . Hypothesis 2 : Motivation Resistance . Over course early treatment ( i.e. , session 1 4 ) , MI-CBT arm demonstrate great increase motivation compare CBT alone arm . In addition , MI-CBT arm exhibit lower in-session resistance early ( session 5 &amp; 7 ) , middle ( session 10 &amp; 12 ) , late ( session 15 &amp; 17 ) phase treatment . Hypothesis 3 : Homework Compliance . The MI-CBT arm show great client- therapist-rated homework compliance throughout CBT treatment compare CBT alone arm . Hypothesis 4a : Interpersonal Processes Clients Therapists . Compared CBT alone client , MI-CBT client therapist report high work alliance quality initial MI session subsequent phase CBT . Furthermore , moment-to-moment interpersonal process client therapist early , middle , late treatment expect characterized adaptive process ( e.g. , high affiliation less hostility ) MI-CBT vs. CBT alone arm . Hypothesis 4b . Interpersonal Processes During Resistance . During episodes client resistance ( identify resistance cod ) , therapist client exchange MI-CBT expect characterized adaptive process ( i.e. , high affiliation , less hostility , great client autonomy-preservation ) compare CBT alone . Further , small subset client ( 5 per treatment group ) interview experience resistance episode , expect client account MI-CBT arm characterize positively ( e.g. , supportive client autonomy , conducive increase engagement vs. disengagement treatment ) compare CBT alone . Hypothesis 5 : Mediation Therapeutic Outcomes . We expect increase motivation reduce resistance MI-CBT , compare CBT alone , lead high level engagement CBT ( well homework compliance therapeutic alliance ) , result great worry reduction .</detailed_description>
