	<brief_summary>The prevalence diabetes mellitus ( DM ) industrialize country estimate 7.3 % incidence grow recent year . The prevalence diabetic neuropathy diabetic patient population 50 % . When limb surgery necessary , reasonable assume diabetic patient benefit peripheral regional anesthesia severe comorbidities associate DM . On hand , use regional anesthesia ( RA ) generally recommend patient preexist neuropathy mainly medical liability issue , worsen neuropathy could attribute nerve damage cause regional anesthetic . The current state art peripheral regional anesthesia identification correct placement injection needle suitably close target nerve elicit motor response current injection needle . Constant reduction current nerve approach ensures close proximity effective nerve block obtain local anesthetic deliver needle , absence motor response 0.3 mA generally accept safety marker avoid harmful intraneural injection . An important deficit understand whether diabetic neuropathy influence stimulation parameter peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) , possibly decrease safety . The currently propose research guide hypothesis nerve patient DM resistant stimulation current threshold PNS set much high prevent injection occur within epineurium . The investigator examine effect DM nerve excitability blind , prospective , observational case control trial . Accordingly , investigator define follow aim : Specific Aim 1 : To characterize required stimulation current patient without diabetes mellitus . Specific Aim 2 : Follow-up examine rate adverse neurologic event higher diabetic patient . Specific Aim 3 : Guided result , formulate recommendation performance regional anesthesia patient history DM . These experiment provide good understand needle-current-nerve relationship peripheral nerve stimulation . Findings study major impact patient safety , especially subgroup preexist neuropathy , undergoing regional anesthesia .</brief_summary>
