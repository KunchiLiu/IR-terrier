	<brief_summary>A natural sweetener ( Stevia Rebaudina Bertoni ) reduce blood glucose level blood pressure accord various preclinical clinical study conduct worldwide . Since find many study literature wich compare Stevia Rebaudiana saccharin , 've propose randomize crossover clinical trial compare effect postprandial capillary blood glucose blood pressure healthy adult . Sample : healthy professional two health center Alava ( Kakuabizkarra primary care center Txagorritxu hospital ) . Inclusion criterion : Professionals two health center Álava ( Lakuabizkarra Txagorritxu ) active employment status begin trial , weigh 50kg age 18 year . Intervention : 200mg capsule Stevia 250mgcapsules saccharin . Measurements : Capillary blood glucose blood pressure , fast eat . Evaluation satiety , hunger fullness questionnaire intake , end day . Statistical analysis : Compare postprandial capillary glucose level 8 1 st hour , 2nd hour 3rd hour intake treatment ANCOVA . We also compare blood pressure intake treatment . We also compare test pair Wilcoxom ( depend nature variable ) result questionnaire intake treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Stevioside Postpandrial Glucose Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>State art : Excessive intake calorie sugar diet cause weight gain impair glucose tolerance healthy subject ( 1 ) . These diet raise postpandrial blood glucose insulin level cause metabolic hormonal change induce feeling hunger fat deposition . These diet also associate disease diabetes , cardiovascular disease cancer ( 2 ) . The origin artificial sweetener date back 1879 accidental discovery saccharin . France 1902 United States 1912 officially ban use lack nutritional value . But Europe allow use saccharin sugar ration world war ( 3 ) . In past three decade increase consumption sweetener allow many people suffer obesity / diabetes restore degree palatability food ( 4 ) . Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni ( Bertoni ) , common name `` sweet herb Paraguay '' plant native Paraguay Brazil , know Indians Ka ' a-he ' e ( sweet grass ) . Its leaf use since pre-Columbian time medicinal purpose sweetener sweet taste ( 5 ) . Japan Brazil 20 year use natural sweetener . The main sweet component Stevia Stevioside , glycoside 300 time sweeter sucrose ( 7 ) . The benefit stevia dietary supplement human many : stable , non-caloric offer good dental health . In addition , significant adverse effect occur use ( 6 ) . There several study compare decline blood glucose insulin level Stevia versus many sweetener . It administer healthy diabetic rat ( 8 ) , healthy human ( 9,10 ) , obese ( 10 ) diabetic ( 11 ) . Another therapeutic property Stevia rebaudiana reduction blood pressure , systolic diastolic Chan et al demonstrate randomized clinical trial conduct China ( 12,13 ) . Toxicity study animal ( 14 ) pregnant ( 15 ) conclude consumption Stevia safe commonly use dos sweetener ( 7 ) . Furthermore , quality life deteriorate ( 12 ) adverse effect detect ( 16 ) . The available data suggest stevia immunostimulatory activity inflammation modulating . But effect demonstrate robust animal model cell line . If confirm , use stevia could cause problem subgroups population like people autoimmune diseases gastrointestinal tract inflammation ( 6 ) . In USA use dietary supplement since 1995 , evaluate sweetener European Scientific Committee Food 1984 , 1989 1999 conclude toxicologically acceptable enough study ( 6 ) . However , recently , FDA , WHO FAO approve Stevia `` food additive '' use people age ( 17 ) . In summary , literature indicate steviol use safely sweetener healthy population , bring significant benefit control blood glucose level blood pressure . However , date study compare Stevia common sweetener . For reason , compare effect saccharin versus Stevioside , plan conduct randomize crossover clinical trial . Study justification : Diets high sucrose promote weight gain , cause alteration glucose tolerance healthy subject ( 1 ) associate metabolic disorder like diabetes wich characterize plasma glucose level normal limit n't adequately treated lead complication neuropathy , retinopathy , neuropathy , diabetic microangiopathy atherosclerosis . Since diabetic patient eat sugar , artificial sweetener use increase past three decade due fact consumption substance allow many people suffer obesity /or diabetes restore degree palatability food ( 4 ) . Among , natural sweetener , Stevioside also reduce level postprandial glucose insulin , blood pressure . Besides consumption Stevia safe dos normally use sweetener According review literature , Stevioside use safely sweetener healthy population , provide significant benefit control blood glucose level blood pressure serious adverse reaction . In study literature , Stevioside 's effect compare placebo , however , date study conduct wich compare sweetener commonly use people . For reason , compare effect safety Stevioside versus Saccharin plan randomize crossover clinical trial .</detailed_description>
