	<brief_summary>In many urban centre include Vancouver 's Downtown Eastside , high rate HIV infection among user illicit drug . Among drug user present care start highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , retention care adherence treatment regimen may less optimal . Given known benefit HAART individual populational level , new strategy require help retain HIV-infected drug user HAART . Contingency management ( CM ) strategy affect behaviour provide reward ( e.g . money ) reinforce desire behaviour . CM use success area medicine ( e.g . smoke cessation , weight loss ) drug use population , establish mean improve retention HAART program . The propose research primarily seek assess effectiveness monetary-based CM retain HIV-infected drug user HAART program . 240 HAART-eligible subject randomize 2:1 ratio either receive ( n=160 ) reinforcer control arm ( n=80 ) . All subject receive HAART standard care , randomize reinforcer arm receive escalate reinforcement initially attendance clinic visit ( month 6 start HAART ) subsequently ( month 12 start HAART ) receive escalate variable reinforcer month plasma viral load less equal 100 copies/mL maintain . Our hypothesis drug user initiate HAART randomly select receive reinforcer attend clinic visit maintain monthly virologic suppression first 52 week HAART initiation significantly likely achieve virologic suppression 52 week , significantly long duration sustain virologic suppression first 52 week , significantly likely maintain virologic suppression 72 week HAART initiation , offer reinforcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once HAART initiate , participant expect assessed week 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,14 , 16 . Detailed adherence dispensing record antiretroviral medication participant maintain . Adherence assess primarily basis pharmacy refill record , well self-report . Subsequently participant attend monthly clinical follow-up visit week 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 48 , 52 . Standard laboratory monitoring perform time , include complete blood count ( CBC ) , differential , basic chemistry , liver kidney profile , well CD4 cell count plasma HIV-1-RNA level , consistent current care guideline . All patient also undergo urine toxicology screen baseline quarterly ( week 12 , 24 , 36 , 52 ) order assess effect engage HAART program substance use . Follow-up also include adverse event assessment ( ADE ) standardize list sign symptom note either patient practitioner identify laboratory testing . At baseline quarterly visit , participant complete Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) score 16 correlate risk depression . This tool validate population prior study . Participants also complete Addiction Severity Index questionnaire , validate instrument use examine severity psychosocial problem seven domain include drug alcohol use . Composite score derive , high score reflect great problem . Past 3-month version HIV Risk Behavior Scale also administer baseline quarterly visit . This scale assess injection drug use sexual behavior , response cod 6-point scale high value indicate high risk . Participants randomize receive reinforcer clinic follow-up receive reinforcer end clinic visit . When reinforcer link plasma viral load , subject reinforcer arm notify within week plasma viral load result , reinforcement earn . Subjects elect come time receive reinforcement , wait next monthly appointment receive earnings time . For participant present laboratory clinical follow-up within two week either side schedule quarterly visit , extensive investigation client 's whereabouts street outreach well search hospital record hospitalization provincial vital statistic database possible death prompt . Those discontinue therapy lose follow-up 52 week consider therapy failure analysis . A final visit 24 week week 52 visit perform . This involve procedures quarterly study visit first year , include standard laboratory test urine toxicology , ADE assessment , CES-D , Addiction Severity Index HIV Risk Behavior Scale questionnaire . Participants fail present laboratory clinical follow-up within 2 week expect date visit seek described .</detailed_description>
