MNPs distribute FCHVs 110 child select community already HFP IYCF-BCC intervention . This group child compare outcome parameter anemia , growth ( stunt , underweight waste ) infection ( diarrhea , fever cough ) similar sub-set child ( n=110 ) receive HFP IYCF-BCC intervention third sub-set control child similar age ( n=110 ) receive either intervention . Children age 6-9 month choose study age range capture recommend age introduction complementary food child choose age group also fall within 0-24 month age range consider period rapid growth development therefore period high nutrient requirement child .</detailed_description>
