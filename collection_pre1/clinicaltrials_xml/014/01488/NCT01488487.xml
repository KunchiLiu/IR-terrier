	<brief_title>Everolimus Pasireotide ( SOM230 ) Patients With Advanced Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single-arm Phase II study ass time progression ( TTP ) safety everolimus pasireotide patient advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) limit prior systemic therapy . Should regimen demonstrate efficacy , support Phase III randomize clinical trial combination therapy . At least 30 patient enrol Phase II study . Additionally , give potential importance RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK RAS/pAKT pathway , propose correlate outcome baseline pAKT , p-S6 , somatostatin receptor tumor expression , serum VEGF expression . We anticipate exploratory analysis increase understand molecular pathway inhibition disease . The study perform University North Carolina-coordinated , multicenter study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each subject must meet follow inclusion criterion participate study : 1 . Advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma ( stage C per BCLC criterion , see Appendix A ) . HCC may diagnose tissue diagnosis Alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) &gt; 400 ng/mL compatible mass Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ( MRI ) . Cat Scan ( CT ) abdomen 3phase contrast arterial phase enhancement acceptable , although MRI prefer ( image do within 4 week study initiation ) . Recurrences previously resect HCC require tissue confirmation clear radiographic recurrence judgment investigator . Disease must otherwise amenable local therapy . 2 . Maximum ChildsPugh score 6 ( see Appendix A ) active encephalopathy 3 . Prior systemic therapy limit sorafenib discontinue due intolerance . Patients must undergo least 4week washout prior enrollment . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) PS 02 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week 6 . Age ≥18 year 7 . Patients receive previous local therapy , surgery , radiotherapy , hepatic arterial embolization , chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation , percutaneous injection , cryoablation , eligible enrollment study provide documented progression disease amenable local therapy . Therapy must complete &gt; 4 week prior study initiation ( Day 1 everolimus pasireotide administration ) . 8 . Minimum 4 week since major surgery 9 . No active serious infection comorbid illness would impair ability participate trial . 10. International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤2.0 stable dose warfarin stable dose low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) &gt; 2 week time enrollment ) . 11 . Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ( TGs ) ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . 12 . Patients must adequate organ function evidence : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hg ) &gt; 9 g/dL Bilirubin ≤2 x ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min ( estimate Cockcroft Gault measure ) 13 . Serum magnesium serum potassium within institutional normal limit ( patient may replacement ) 14 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior Day 1 everolimus pasireotide administration . 15 . WOCBP men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Men woman use adequate birth control least 8 week last administration study drug . ( Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction therefore consider effective study . ) 16 . Signed , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve write informed consent Patients meet follow exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation : 1 . Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) somatostatin analog ( e.g . octeotride ) 2 . Chronic treatment systemic steroid ( except intermittent topical , local injection , eye drop ) another immunosuppressive agent . NOTE : This restriction regard systemic steroid apply patient need course glucocorticoid treatment noninfectious pneumonitis study ( see Section 4.5.2 ) . 3 . Patients know hypersensitivity everolimus rapamycins ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients 4 . Patients know hypersensitivity somatostatin excipients 5 . Concurrent plan radiation , hormonal , chemotherapeutic , experimental , targeted biologic therapy 6 . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week 7 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV ) Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function define spirometry diffuse capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN Glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 8.0 % ( Note : principle investigator 's discretion , ineligible patient rescreened adequate medical therapy institute . ) Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection . NOTE : A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . Hepatitis B viral deoxyribonucleic acid ( HBV DNA ) Hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid ( HCV RNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection . See Section 4.2 information . 8 . Clinically significant third space fluid accumulation ( i.e. , ascites require paracentesis despite use diuretic ) pleural effusion either require thoracentesis associate shortness breath 9 . Risk factor prolongation Corrected QT Interval ( QTc ) * include : QTc screen &gt; 450 msec History syncope family history idiopathic sudden death Sustained clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Risk factor Torsades de Pointes hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , cardiac failure , clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia , highgrade AV block Concomitant disease ( ) could prolong QT autonomic neuropathy ( cause diabetes Parkinson 's disease ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , uncontrolled hypothyroidism , cardiac failure Concomitant medication ( ) know increase QT interval ( See Appendix B ) University North Carolina Chapel Hill ( UNC ) use GE electrocardiogram ( ECG ) cart use Bazett formula QTc . 10 . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within 1 week study entry study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , Bacillus CalmetteGuérin ( BCG ) , yellow fever , varicella , TY21a typhoid vaccine . 11 . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases 12 . Symptomatic cholelithiasis 13 .
