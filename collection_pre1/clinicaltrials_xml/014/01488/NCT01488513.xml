	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) ABC294640 ( sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640 ) patient solid organ tumor . ( Part I ) II . To assess safety tolerability ABC294640 MTD expand cohort hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient . ( Part II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish dose ABC294640 recommend future phase II protocol . ( Part I ) II . To describe pharmacokinetics ABC294640 patient solid organ tumor . ( Part I ) III . To describe effect ABC294640 plasma level sphingosine 1-phosphate patient solid organ tumor . ( Part I ) IV . To assess antitumor activity ABC294640 patient solid organ tumor objective radiographic assessment use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . ( Part I ) V. To describe pharmacokinetics ABC294640 HCC patient . ( Part II ) VI . To describe effect ABC294640 plasma level sphingosine 1-phosphate HCC patient . ( Part II ) VII . To assess antitumor activity ABC294640 HCC patient objective radiographic assessment use RECIST 1.1 criterion . ( Part II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year .</detailed_description>
