	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) disease bone marrow characterize anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ( low red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet count ) . MDS patient thrombocytopenia fail standard therapy require regular platelet transfusion expensive inconvenient , risk serious bleed complication . The new treatment MDS use azacitidine show increase survival rate MDS patient include improve platelet production time . However , early cycle treatment azacitidine , low platelet count tend exacerbate provide clinical benefit . Eltrombopag drug design activate thrombopoietin receptor . Eltrombopag able increase platelet count healthy Thrombocytopenia Purpura ( ITP ) , disease patient destroy platelet rapidly thus develop thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag administer orally Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) approve treatment thrombocytopenia patient chronic ITP fail respond standard treatment . This study single arm pilot study evaluate safety tolerability Eltrombopag treatment low platelet count adult subject MDS treat use azacitidine This study also incorporate correlative laboratory component design determine mechanism action 5-azacitidine +/- Eltrombopag determine baseline profile may predict responsive . These study incorporate gene methylation expression , immunoprofiling .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients low platelet count ( &lt; =150 x109/L ) addition disease diagnosis either MDS , nonproliferative CMML low marrow blast count AML suitable induction chemotherapy Age &gt; 18 year ECOG score 02 screen Life expectancy ≥12 week Ability comply adequate contraception patient childbearing potential . Subjects diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukaemia Prior treatment azacitidine methyltransferase inhibitor ( e.g . decitabine ) Prior treatment eltrombopag , romiplostim , TPOreceptor agonist AML MDS require cytoreductive therapy ( eg hydroxyurea , arac , thioguanine etc ) month prior study entry Known uncontrolled medical condition may compromise participation study include limited : Poorly control congestive heart failure : ejection fraction &lt; 30 % measure past 6 month ) NYHA class IV Arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event . Unstable angina ischaemic cardiac event require hospital admission previous 12 month . Unresolved GI disease may significantly alter absorption eltrombopag Known prothrombotic condition define history ≥1 unprovoked deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism , DVT/PE procoagulant condition screen suggest presence procoagulant condition ( prothrombin gene mutation homozygosity , factor V leiden homozygosity , antithrombin deficiency , lupus anticoagulant syndrome ) . History Ischaemic neurological event ( TIA stroke ) within precede 2 year . Inadequate renal function ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min CockcroftGault ( CG ) formula , measure 24 hour urinary creatinine clearance ) Inadequate hepatic function : bilirubin ≥1.5xULN ≤80µmol/L acceptable attribute haemolysis , ineffective erythropoiesis iron overload ) . This applies also patient Gilbert 's Syndrome . AST ALT ≥2xULN ( ≤3xULN acceptable attribute transfusionassociated iron overload ) Patients know liver cirrhosis . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition include history malignancy MDS/AML precede 2 year require chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Non melanotic skin cancer require low dose local radiotherapy topical agent allow study consider clinically stable heal . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Treatment growth factor erythropoietin , GCSF stem cell factor 21 day prior commencement study therapy . Active uncontrolled infection . Subjects know HIV infection . Has clinically important abnormality determine investigator may interfere participation compliance study Bone marrow fibrosis lead inability aspirate marrow quality cytological assessment , term `` dry tap '' . Presence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule . This condition must discuss patient prior sign consent registration trial . Splenomegaly &gt; 14cm screen ultrasound examination .</criteria>
