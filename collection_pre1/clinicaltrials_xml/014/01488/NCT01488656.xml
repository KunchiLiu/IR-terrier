	<brief_summary>This study determine comprehensive antioxidant/anti-inflammatory dietary supplement pack offer protection decline lung function increase inflammation oxidative stress follow acute exposure particulate matter air pollution diameter &lt; 2.5 µm ( PM2.5 ) . The investigator hypothesis follow : Compared appropriate control , supplementation comprehensive antioxidant/anti-inflammatory dietary supplement pack 18 week : 1 ) reduce decline lung function follow acute exposure naturally occur elevation PM2.5 level measure exhale nitric oxide level force vital lung capacity ; 2 ) reduce change pro-inflammatory cytokine follow acute exposure naturally occur elevation PM2.5 level measure plasma level C-reactive protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct Cache County , UT . Surrounded tall mountain ( 2513-3042 ) , subject frequent winter atmospheric inversion characterize stagnant air trap concentrate pollutant , Cache Valley , home 120,000 inhabitant , particularly susceptible high particulate air pollution winter month . A total 70 individual ( goal complete 60 ) age 45-80 recruited Cache County , UT . Eligible participant randomly assign one two treatment arm ( Placebo Dietary Supplements , Active Dietary Supplements ) manner provide balance assignment two arm respect age , sex baseline exhale nitric oxide level . Participants assign Placebo Active arm provide sealed envelope bottle contain dietary supplement ( match placebo ) along instruction consume supplement . Participants instructed consume supplement twice day meal contain small amount fat ( least 3 gram ) order optimize absorption fat soluble nutrient . They also instruct consume supplement liquid order enhance absorption minimize GI upset choke potential . Participants ask maintain typical diet 18 week study . Routine Clinic Visits schedule two week interval length study ( accommodation make Holiday schedule ) . During visit , participant : 1 ) receive sufficient supply supplement last next routine clinic visit ; 2 ) return unused supplement ; 3 ) provide opportunity describe adverse events/reactions supplement ; 4 ) describe health issue experience since previous exam ; 5 ) weight blood pressure assess . Endpoint Clinic Visits schedule coincide low high PM2.5 exposure . Starting Jan 2 , participant notify potential endpoint assessment day PM2.5 level predict Utah Department Environmental Quality , Division Air Quality , rise 30 µg/m3 ( peak event ) fall 8 µg/m3 ( baseline event ) . Endpoint visit take place 24 hr follow peak baseline event . Based historical pattern , anticipate least three peak event , correspond baseline assessment , intervention time period . For purpose analysis , peak event pair near baseline event event capture similar time initiation intervention . At endpoint clinic visit , participant undergo assessment lung function systemic inflammation . Blood sample obtain potential future analysis additional marker systemic inflammation plasma antioxidant capacity .</detailed_description>
