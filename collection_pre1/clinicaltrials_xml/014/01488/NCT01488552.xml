	<detailed_description>The investigator PCRT team develop therapeutic regimen attack tumor compartment stromal compartment pancreatic cancer induces complete response small percentage patient advance stage IV pancreatic cancer . The gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel regimen outstanding activity 67 patient phase I/II trial patient recommend phase II dose ( n=44 ) decrease CA19-9 , complete response median survival 12.2 month . The propose regimen devise study bold , innovative approach specific aim utilizing relentless pursuit approach try make complete response rate &gt; 70 % response durable ( PCRT define last least 6 month ) dramatically enhance percent patient survive one year ( try make rate &gt; 70 % ) . The induction regimen investigator propose collapse stroma ( gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel ) address use non-cross resistant active regimen ( FOLFIRINOX ) consolidation regimen . Both improve chance drive tumor marker dramatically . The investigator think FOLFIRINOX stromal collapse induce initial regimen , plus totally non-cross resistant shot disease ( consolidation ) , maximize chance achieve complete response attendant improvement survival . After consolidation , patient maintain less toxic target therapy select molecular profiling plus use antimetabolomic agent metformin consistently associate well survival multiple retrospective study ( Jiralerspong et al. , 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
