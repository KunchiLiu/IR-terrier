	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Low-dose cytarabine work minority elderly patient acute myeloid leukemia unfit intensive induction therapy kill leukemia cell . Addition BIBF1120 low-dose cytarabine might enhance kill leukemia cell . PURPOSE : This phase I / II trial study safe BIBF1120 combine low-dose cytarabine ( phase I ) well combination low-dose cytarabine BIBF1120 work elderly patient acute myeloid leukemia unfit intensive chemotherapy ( phase II ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients newly diagnose AML ( except APL ) accord FAB WHO classification , include AML evolve MDS hematological disease AML previous cytotoxic therapy radiation ( secondary AML ) , medical contraindication willing receive standard induction consolidation therapy . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy must contain &gt; 20 % blast nucleate cell . In AML FAB M6 ≥ 30 % nonerythroid cell bone marrow must leukemic blast . In patient 2030 % blast , indication treatment hypomethylating agent ( 5azacitidine decitabine ) consider prior inclusion trial . Age ≥ 60 year Informed consent , personally sign date participate study Male patient enrol trial must use adequate barrier birth control measure course treatment least 3 month last administration study therapy ( lowdose cytarabine and/or BIBF 1120 ) . Patients 2030 % bone marrow blast qualify consent therapy hypomethylating agent Patients eligible consent standard chemotherapy Known central nervous system manifestation AML Inadequate liver function ( ALT AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN ) cause leukemic infiltration Known chronically active hepatitis C infection acute hepatitis Chronically impair renal function ( creatinin clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ) Uncontrolled hypertension rest pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg despite adequate treatment severe trauma surgery within 4 week study entry severe , nonhealing wound , ulcer fracture Uncontrolled active infection Concurrent malignancy AML severe disease opinion investigator likely influence endpoint assessment Hypersensitivity cytarabine ( include drug fever exanthema ) Previous treatment AML except hydroxyurea 24 hour study medication Previous therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor angiogenesis inhibitor Parallel participation another clinical trial indication .
