	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate administration CYD dengue vaccine follow compressed schedule different population . Primary Objectives : - To describe humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes baseline 28 day CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3 define study group . - To describe persistence humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes 6 month CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3 define study group . Secondary Objective : - To describe humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes baseline 28 day CYD dengue vaccine Dose 1 Dose 2 define study group , irrespective whether Yellow fever ( YF ) vaccine previously administer . - To describe YF humoral immune response baseline 1 , 3 , 7 month injection YF vaccine Month 0 Groups 3 4 . - To describe safety profile term solicit injection site systemic event , unsolicited adverse event serious adverse event injection CYD dengue vaccine and/or YF vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participant randomize receive CYD Dengue alone , CYD Dengue and/or Yellow fever ( YF ) vaccine . Participants already receive YF vaccine prior enrolment randomize one group receive CYD Dengue alone . Flavivirus status determine baseline ( first dose ) vaccine immunogenicity assessment 28 day vaccination . Reactogenicity data collect subject dose . Serious adverse event adverse event special interest collect throughout study . The expected duration participation trial 18 month 7 month participant receive YF vaccine .</detailed_description>
