	<brief_summary>Study Design : To evaluate efficacy combination sirolimus tacrolimus graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis , investigator go perform phase II , multicenter clinical trial human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched , related peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) patient hematologic malignancy . Total 116 patient accrue . Objective : The primary objective evaluate rate 100 day Grade II-IV acute GVHD . Secondary objective include time neutrophil platelet engraftment , incidence grade III-IV acute GVHD , non-relapse mortality 100 day transplant , mucositis severity , infectious complication include cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) reactivation , vascular complication ( venoocclusive disease liver ; VOD , thrombotic microangiopathy ; TMA ) , disease-free survival , overall survival 1 year transplant . Eligibility Criteria : Eligible patient 20 60 year age , acute leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , adequate organ function . For available sibling donor , serologic ( high resolution ) 6/6 Class I HLA-A B molecular Class II DRB1 must match . Treatment Description : Conditioning regimen vary center donor donate peripheral blood stem cell accord local institutional practice . Peripheral blood stem cell manipulate T-depleted prior infusion . Tacrolimus administer 0.05 mg/kg/day intravenously continuous infusion begin day -1 target serum concentration 5 10 ng/mL . Sirolimus administer 6 mg oral load dose day -1 , follow 3 mg/day single dose , target serum concentration 3 12 ng/mL . Levels monitor weekly hospitalization clinically indicate . Intravenous tacrolimus convert oral equivalent dose prior discharge immunosuppressive taper begin day +100 transplantation eliminate day +180 clinically feasible . Accrual Period : The estimated accrual period three year . Patients follow 100 day post transplantation evaluation primary endpoint , additional follow-up two year transplantation evaluation secondary endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) remain major cause morbidity mortality allogeneic HSCT . The combination calcineurin inhibitor methotrexate standard GVHD prophylactic regimen past 20 year . However , incidence acute GVHD remain high , report cumulative incidence grade II-IV 60 % . Serious acute GVHD chronic GVHD detrimental consequence patient include death , disability , infection , prolonged hospitalization . Sirolimus first available inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) . And sirolimus bind uniquely FK-binding protein ( FKBP12 ) form complex mTOR . This complex inhibit several biochemical pathway , result reduction DNA transcription , DNA translation , protein synthesis , cell cycling , ultimately lead T-cell immunosuppression . Sirolimus use alone combination calcineurin inhibitor prevention allograft rejection solid organ transplantation . In field hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , combination sirolimus tacrolimus also result low incidence acute GVHD reduce transplant-related toxicity . In addition , investigator demonstrate previously combination tacrolimus sirolimus effective GVHD prophylaxis well tolerate case high risk transplantation use mismatch related unrelated donor . As discussed , sirolimus emerge one promising immunosuppressive agent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . However , benefit GVHD prophylaxis regimens include sirolimus confirm consistently controversy incorporation sirolimus GVHD prophylaxis result improve survival . Efficacy measure : Patients follow 100 day post transplantation evaluation primary endpoint ( incidence severity acute GVHD ) clinical data collect 100 day HSCT use case report form . And patient recommend additional follow-up one year HSCT evaluation secondary endpoint parameter include clinical outcome ( disease-free survival overall 1 year transplant ) . The investigator perform interim analysis time 31 patient enrol phase 1 . Acute GVHD grade accord consensus grade scale ( appendix-1 ) . The broad category acute GVHD include : 1 . Classic acute GVHD ( maculopapular rash , nausea , vomit , anorexia , profuse diarrhea , illus , cholestatic hepatitis ) occur within 100 day transplantation ( without diagnostic distinctive sign chronic GVHD ) 2 . Persistent , recurrent , late acute GVHD : Features classic acute GVHD without diagnostic distinctive manifestation chronic GVHD occur beyond 100 day transplantation ( often see withdrawal immune suppression ) . Safety : All safety analysis base safety population . The assessment safety base mainly frequency adverse event number laboratory value fall outside predetermined range . Adverse event summarize present number percentage patient adverse event well severity study treatment . In addition summary grade 3 4 present . During administration drug GVHD prophylaxis , toxicity relate drug grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v3.0 ) . Patients also assess regularly physical examination laboratory test include CBC , biochemistry include liver function test chest X-ray . Statistical Methods : Descriptive statistical analysis perform assess patient baseline characteristic , engraftment , acute GVHD , non-relapse mortality . Overall survival relapse-free survival calculate use Kaplan-Meier method estimate use compete risk 100-day mortality cumulative incidence rate grade II-IV acute GVHD .</detailed_description>
