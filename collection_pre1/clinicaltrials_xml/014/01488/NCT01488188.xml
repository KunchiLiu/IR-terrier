	<brief_summary>Background : It well establish live attenuate organism highly effective vaccine , immune response elicit often great magnitude long duration produce non-living antigen often able confer protection single dose . Unlike kill influenza vaccine preparation inject parenteral route , live influenza vaccine able induce potent secretory ( mainly IgA ) antibody responses airway mucosa also evoke cell mediate response . T cell proliferation , cytokine production , cytotoxic T cell responses antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity elicit live attenuate vaccine . There history use live attenuate flu vaccine safe effective vaccine prevention flu animal human . Live-attenuated cold-adapted influenza vaccine prove highly efficacious protect clinical fly symptom . Among , FluMist , nasal vaccine formulation develop Medimmune Inc , approve US FDA . Recent side side clinical trial demonstrate nasal vaccine significantly superior conventional kill flu vaccine protect flu symptom . Sublingual administration live influenza virus dose lethal nasal route well tolerate redirect virus olfactory bulb . In addition , recent Phase I clinical study ( NCT00820144 ) conduct France , sublingual administration recombinant cholera toxin B subunit ( rCTB , 1 mg ) healthy adult volunteer find safe . A major issue arisen regard ease vaccine could administer young child , especially infant , elderly subject nasal vaccination possible and/or approve due difficulty administer nasal vaccine infant undesired side effect related frequent rhinitis sneeze episode elderly subject . This study design investigate safety , tolerability immunogenicity new route administration vaccine , use nasal FluMist formulation prototype vaccine . Objectives : To evaluate immunogenicity safety nasal sublingual influenza virus vaccine ( FluMist ) healthy adult volunteer Study design : This randomize study total 40 subject ; 20 subject receive vaccine via nasal sublingual route , respectively</brief_summary>
