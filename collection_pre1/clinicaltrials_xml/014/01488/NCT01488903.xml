	<detailed_description>Not many study examine genetic determinant obesity woman . As premenopausal postmenopausal woman appear different propensity fat deposition , genetic locus link obesity-related phenotype might different menopausal status . So far , large scale genetic study decipher common obesity woman focus interaction age menopause Taiwan . The investigator propose study compare phenotypic profile obesity cardiometabolic factor large group premenopausal postmenopausal woman . The study examine contribution age menopausal status change obesity-related trait , evaluate contribution genetic susceptibility body fat deposition among woman different stage menopause . The investigator plan recruit two group subject : 600 premenopausal , 600 postmenopausal woman . Each woman receive anthropometric blood pressure measurement , fast blood sample lipid , optional 75-g oral glucose tolerance test insulin resistance . Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry also use body composition measurement among study woman agree receive optional examination . The investigator collect blood sample DNA extraction select several candidate gene study association susceptible gene obesity-related trait . The investigator anticipate result generate study provide valuable data well understanding pathogenesis common obesity transition premenopause postmenopause woman .</detailed_description>
