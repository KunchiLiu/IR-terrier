	<brief_title>Feasibility Radio-Frequency Microstimulator System Improve Arm Function Following Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) could involve damage motor pathway within central nervous system , result loss arm function symptom include general weakness , loss power , motor control abnormalities spasticity . The Radiofrequency Microstimulator ( RFM ) System consist fully implant , leadless stimulators inject minimally invasive procedure . RFMs measure 16.7mm long , 2.4mm dia . place directly target nerve arm drive specific muscle contraction . This system demonstrate efficacy arm rehabilitation stroke patient suffer loss arm function similar experience TBI patient . This feasibility study evaluate RFM system use assist patient rehabilitation arm function follow TBI . TBI patient pass screen 7 RFM device implant disabled arm . After implantation , patient participate four phase therapy , last 12 week consist standard occupational therapy occur regular interval home clinic . In first phase , therapy involve use RFM System . In second phase , occupational therapy assist electrical stimulation use RFM System . The third fourth phase repeat therapy first second phase , respectively . Arm function follow therapy RFM stimulation compare arm function therapy without RFM stimulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject sustain Traumatic Brain Injury least 6 48 month prior time consent . 2 . As result Traumatic Brain Injury , subject impaired hand function associate poor control weakness wrist elbow extensor least one side . 3 . Subject preserve control arm treat demonstrated voluntary movement finger shoulder . 4 . Subject functional , passive Range Motion shoulder , elbow , wrist finger joint arm treat . 5 . Subject 's spasticity maximally medically control document stable without change medication therapy minimum one month . 6 . Peripheral neuromuscular system intact demonstrate electrophysiologic response routine clinical nerve conduction study electromyography arm treat . 7 . Subject assign level less VII Rancho Los Amigos Levels Cognitive Functioning Scale . 8 . Subject fluent English . 9 . Subject legally authorize representative sign informed consent form . 10 . Subject ( either male female ) least 18 year age time consent . 11 . Subject willing capable travel investigational site study visit outline protocol . 12 . In opinion Principal Investigator ( PI ) , subject able apply per protocol therapy home , aid caregiver necessary . 1 . Subject unwilling perform therapy assessment require study . 2 . Subject active implant device ( e.g . pacemaker , implanted cardiac defibrillator , neurostimulator , drug infusion device ) . 3 . Subject metal implant ( e.g . orthopedic hardware , stent , etc . ) locate within 12 cm RF Coil surface place RFM EStim therapy . 4 . Subject metal fragment , metal implant , bullet fragment , metal chip clip around orbit cranium metal inside body would contraindicate MRI make unreadable purpose analysis . 5 . Subject congenital defect , contracture , upper extremity trauma , nonTBI condition limit range motion neuromuscular function involve arm . 6 . Subject documented diagnosis HIV life limit infection disease . 7 . A female subject pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant course study . Women childbearing potential must maintain effective contraception study period , judge Investigator . 8 . Subject major psychological disorder , poorly control schizophrenia paranoia , cooperative status inconsistent . 9 . Subject severe claustrophobia , movement medically control condition would limit ability undergo MRI scan remain still throughout MRI scan . 10 . Subject noncontrolled epilepsy . 11 . In opinion PI , subject high level residual spasticity despite maximal medical therapy . 12 . Subject peripheral neuropathy myopathy either upper extremity would preclude implementation propose stimulation technique ( i.e . involvement peripheral nerve muscle involve extension elbow , wrist , finger ) . An exception make carpel tunnel syndrome . 13 . Subject muscle power grade 3 elbow , wrist finger extensor arm treat , accord Medical Research Council ( MRC ) scale . 14 . Subject history endocarditis , prosthetic valve murmur . 15 . Subject history adverse reaction anesthetic agent . 16 . Recent current participation research may influence response either study intervention , harmful subject way . 17 . Subject 's life expectancy le 1.5 year . 18 . Subject bleed clot disorder . 19 . Subject pain opinion PI would impair participation . 20 . Subject unwilling refrain use transcutaneous electrical stimulation arm treat duration study participation . 21 . The PI feel subject suitable candidate study , reason .</criteria>
