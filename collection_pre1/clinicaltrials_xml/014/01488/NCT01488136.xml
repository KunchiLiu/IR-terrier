	<brief_summary>The investigator know intensive insulin therapy tight glucose control associate reduction diabetic complication . However , many patient insulin n't achieve risk fear hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) . There lot work do recently look mechanism brain detects hypoglycaemia . A key player potassium channel brain ( KATP channel ) . Studies show channel open , release hormone adrenaline help raise blood sugar counteract increase awareness hypoglycaemia . The investigator study aim look old drug call diazoxide , able open KATP channel . The investigator aim see diazoxide amplify release hormone adrenaline blood sugar low . If case , aid quicker recovery follow hypoglycaemia . The investigator aim perform well establish experimental protocol perform safely last 20 year call clamp study . The clamp study involve slowly bring blood sugar use insulin intravenous glucose control fashion . The main outcome hormonal response ( adrenaline response ) blood sugar level 2.5mmol/L . Symptoms hypoglycaemia monitor , well work memory test use standardised questionnaire . The design investigator study randomise trial compare effect diazoxide placebo patient receive diazoxide placebo random order ( crossover design ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This conduct double blind ( neither subject researcher know order IMP ( drug/placebo ) . All subject receive active drug placebo random fashion ( crossover design ) . Once identify , patient give participant information sheet . They contact later date ( minimum 24 hour ) determine willing participate trial . Subjects consent , attend screen visit , ascertain whether fit inclusion/exclusion criterion . Further detail study also give visit . They attend day first study , show use continuous glucose monitor measure glucose overnight , prior start study . The reason , low blood sugar night study , influence result study , give alternative day attend . Provided free hypoglycaemic episode , night , proceed study . On day study , place two intravenous cannulae . The cannulae hand vein place warm chamber , order make reflective sampling blood brain barrier . The subject either investigational medicinal product ( diazoxide ) placebo . Blood pressure heart rate monitor throughout clamp study . After 2 hour , use insulin dextrose , subject 's blood sugar bring near normal keep 40 minute . After , blood sugar drop stage , blood sugar 2.5mmol/L reach . The blood sugar monitor closely , 5 minute sample take one cannulue situ , avoid repeat stabbing . Also regular interval , blood sample take measurement hormone , include adrenaline . At stage , subject ask symptom experience series verbal work memory test also perform .</detailed_description>
