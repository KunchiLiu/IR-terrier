	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare saphenous vein harvest use atraumatic pedicled ( `` no-touch '' ) technique saphenous vein harvest use conventional open technique patient undergo isolated coronary artery bypass surgery . Investigators compare biological structure saphenous vein harvest use two technique . There evidence saphenous vein harvest use `` no-touch '' technique may allow good patency 8 year follow bypass surgery . We may able detect early difference vascular structure , observed time conduit harvest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis complex , multifactorial inflammatory disease , initiate largely area endothelial injury , secondary biomechanical disturbance , systemic factor lipoprotein disturbance , hypertension , diabetes , smoke ( response injury hypothesis ) . Accumulating data indicate structural and/or functional alteration endothelial integrity play primordial role development atherosclerosis via promote aberrant interaction modify lipoprotein , monocyte-derived macrophage , T cell normal cellular element arterial wall incite early plaque formation . As , strategy , either pharmacological mechanical nature reduce and/or restore endothelial homeostasis remain important cornerstone limit atherosclerosis . Investigators hypothesize saphenous vein harvest use atraumatic pedicled ( `` no-touch '' ) technique patient undergo isolated coronary artery bypass surgery exhibit superior index vasomotor structure compare vein harvest use conventional open technique . We anticipate leg heal significantly alter use `` no-touch '' technique . Eligible patient two SVG segment harvest , one low leg . One leg SVG harvest conventional fashion contralateral leg SVG harvest use `` touch '' technique . This determined block randomization reveal time skin incision . For patient small low leg saphenous vein , surgical protocol would use thigh segment instead . Patients Duplex scan evaluate saphenous vein pre-operatively .</detailed_description>
