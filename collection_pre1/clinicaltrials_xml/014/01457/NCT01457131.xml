	<brief_summary>Background : - A new cancer treatment involve collect white blood cell individual , modify secrete IL-2 target ESO-1 protein express cancer , return body . The cell may able seek cancer cell destroy . Some kind cancer contain protein call ESO-1 , find surface cell . Doctors want modify white blood cell anti-ESO-1 effect , use treat cancer ESO-1 . In addition add gene target ESO-1 protein cell , gene IL-12 add cell . IL-12 protein stimulate immune system . This type therapy call gene transfer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness anti-ESO-1/IL-12 white blood cell metastatic cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age metastatic cancer express ESO-1 respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood test image study . - Participants leukapheresis month treatment collect white blood cell . - They chemotherapy 5 day treatment suppress immune system , prepare body anti-ESO-1/IL-12 cell . - The anti-ESO-1/IL-12 cell give infusion . - Participants monitor hospital recovery treatment . - Participants regular followup exam every 1 6 month . The exams include blood test , image study , study . Due toxicity see regimen , decide pursue phase 2 portion study ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified White Blood Cells That Secrete IL-2 Express Protein That Targets ESO-1tumor Protein Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - In prior trial show adoptive transfer lymphocyte , transduce T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize NY-ESO-1 antigen , mediate regression metastatic cancer , though response often transient , complete response rare . - Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) important immunostimulatory cytokine . We construct retroviral vector contain inducible single chain IL-12 driven NFAT responsive promoter use mediate transfer gene anti-tumor lymphocyte . This construct enable secretion IL-12 follow stimulation TCR . - Transduction IL-12 gene mouse anti-tumor lymphocyte result profound increase ability lymphocytes mediate tumor regression follow administration tumor bear mouse . These cell profound advantage induce anti-tumor response cell need requirement concomitant administration interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) case conventional cell transfer immunotherapy . - Based study use retrovirus encode inducible human single chain IL-12 driven NFAT responsive promoter retrovirus encode anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR cotransduce autologous lymphocyte treatment patient metastatic cancer express NY-ESO-1 antigen . Objectives : Primary objective : - To evaluate safety administration IL-12 anti-NY-ESO-1 engineer lymphocytes patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen . - To determine administration transduce lymphocytes patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer . Secondary objective : - To determine vivo survival cotransduced gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must - Metastatic cancer whose tumor express ESO antigen ; - ECOG performance status 0 1 ; Design : - Autlogous lymphocyte cotransduced retroviral vector , encode IL-12 anti- NY-ESO-1 TCR . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion IL-12/anti-ESO TCR gene-transduced lymphocyte . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , CT chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient SD tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design . Initially , protocol enroll 1 patient first 3 dose cohort unless patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Following cohort 3 , subsequent cohort proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , 5 cohort n=3 . Should single patient experience DLT due cell transfer particular dose level , additional patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) prior start phase II portion . If DLT occur first cohort , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . - Once MTD determine , study proceed phase II portion use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol 2 cohort . If 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol . - The objective determine combination lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , IL-12/ESO TCR gene engineer lymphocyte associate complete response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
