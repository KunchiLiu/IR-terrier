	<detailed_description>Pompe disease rare ( estimate 1 every 40,000 birth ) , inherit often fatal dis-order disables heart muscle . It cause mutation gene encodes enzyme call alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , body use GAA break glycogen , long-term storage form sugar , glucose , body utilize gain energy . But Pompe disease , mutation GAA gene reduce completely eliminate activity essential enzyme . Excessive amount glycogen accumulate everywhere body , cell heart skeletal muscle seriously affect . Researchers identify 70 different mutation GAA gene cause symptom Pompe disease , vary widely term age onset severity . The severity disease age onset related degree enzyme deficiency . Early onset ( infantile ) Pompe disease result complete near complete deficiency GAA . Symptoms begin first month life , feed problem , poor weight gain , muscle weakness , floppiness , head lag . Respiratory difficulty often complicate lung infection . The heart grossly enlarge . More half infant Pompe dis-ease also enlarge tongue . Most baby Pompe disease die cardiac respiratory complication first birthday . Late onset ( juvenile/adult ) Pompe disease result partial deficiency GAA . The onset early first decade childhood late sixth decade adulthood . The primary symptom muscle weakness progress respiratory weakness death respiratory failure course lasting several year . The heart may involve grossly enlarge . A diagnosis Pompe disease confirm screening common genetic mutation measure level GAA enzyme activity blood sample -- test 100 percent accuracy . Once Pompe disease diagnose , test family member consultation professional geneticist re-commended . Carriers reliably identify via genetic mutation analysis . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize blood ( plasma ) affect patent specific metabolic alteration allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study develop new biochemical marker plasma affected patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
