	<detailed_description>The main hypothesis test cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) improve treatment retention outcomes posttraumatic stress substance use disorder . The investigator complete Stage I Safety &amp; Practicality Study , Feasibility Study Pilot Randomized Controlled Study ( compare CBT PTSD versus control condition ) study find CBT PTSD safe effective reduce PTSD symptom , improve retention , reduce substance use . The present study proposes continue test hypothesis evaluate compare PTSD , retention substance use outcomes result CBT versus control condition treatment usual . This term `` Stage II Efficacy Study '' behavioral therapy development require compare investigational treatment ( CBT ) control treatment , within context addiction treatment-as-usual ( intensive outpatient program ) . This large randomize control trial response outcomes pilot trial . The propose research evaluate efficacy relatively simple , manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) PTSD . CBT PTSD design developed delivery counselor employ community addiction treatment program offer conjunction standard community addiction treatment . Outpatients 7 community addiction treatment program , diagnose current PTSD randomly assign receive either : 1 ) CBT PTSD conjunction standard treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) ( n=76 ) ; 2 ) A manual-guided individual addiction counseling ( IAC ) adapt Individual Drug Counseling Manual conjunction TAU ( n=76 ) ; 3 ) TAU ( n=76 ) without additional individual treatment either PTSD substance use disorder . Treatment deliver frontline counselor onsite addiction treatment program . Our objective test follow specific hypothesis : 1 . Patients expose CBT PTSD plus treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) show significantly great improvement PTSD symptom severity relative patient two intervention ( IAC+TAU TAU alone ) three-month six-month follow-up . The IAC+TAU condition show great reduction PTSD symptom severity TAU condition three-month six-month follow-up . 2 . Patients receive CBT PTSD plus TAU manifest equivalent reduction substance use severity ( drug and/or alcohol ) patient IAC+TAU intervention condition three-month six-month follow-up . CBT IAC active treatment target substance use symptom . The CBT+TAU IAC+TAU condition patient exhibit great reduction substance use patient TAU condition three-month six-month follow-up . 3 . Patients CBT condition well retention addiction treatment program relative IAC+TAU TAU alone intervention condition . IAC+TAU good retention addiction treatment program TAU alone . This study involve three-group repeated measure design . Within NIDA stage model , randomize controlled trial matched-attention control condition . The investigator plan examine outcomes associate intervention versus control condition versus treatment-as-usual among patient receive outpatient addiction treatment service ( intensive outpatient program ) . The investigator employ assessment baseline , three-month follow-up , six-month follow-up . Eligible subject randomly assign study CBT therapy ( plus addiction treatment-as-usual ) , matched attention control condition ( individual addiction counsel [ IAC ] plus addiction treatment-as-usual ) addiction treatment-as-usual , follow research assessment regardless whether drop treatment early ( whenever possible ) . Patients admit participate addiction treatment program routinely screen PTSD use brief self-report survey , PTSD checklist ( PCL ) . These form collect clinical staff teh treatment program score PTSD diagnostic criterion . Patients score 44 great PCL approach clinic staff potential interest study . If wish learn study , research coordinator ( on-site employee ) contact , suitable time arrange , patient engage process inform consent . If consent grant , subject completes baseline assessment . The baseline assessment consist measure gather via interview member research team , self-administered survey complete directly subject , review subject 's medical record extract demographic , substance use , treatment history information , well chart diagnosis . The interview portion assessment consist : - Standardized interview design assess PTSD commonly associate axis I DSM-IV diagnosis : Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) . - A urine screen breathalyzer test alcohol drug . - Standardized follow-back method gathering data recent alcohol drug use : Time-line Follow-back Calendar ( TLFB ) .

Research assessment also conduct three month six month post baseline assessment . This follow-up assessment consist measure administer baseline , exception SCID interview . The investigator plan randomize approximately 228 subject study ( 76 CBT , 76 IAC , 76 TAU ) .</detailed_description>
