	<brief_title>Effect 6-week Strawberry Supplementation Insulin Action ( STR2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-center , randomize single blind , placebo-controlled , 6-week , parallel design study follow-up evaluate strawberry-associated chronic improvement insulin action result reduced whole body insulin resistance improve glucose tolerance . This study take approximately 11~12 week . Subjects follow extremely limited polyphenolic diet throughout duration participation study . The limited diet begin 7 day first study visit end last study visit . Following polyphenol-free 7-day run period , Week 0 , subject schedule return Center sequence randomization , Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) well Flow Mediated Dilation ( FMD ) procedure measure endothelial function . Subjects incorporate either one tow Placebo Beverages ( PBO1 , n=15 ; PBO2 , n=15 ) Strawberry Beverage ( STR , n=15 , optimal strawberry test dose 40 g/d ) diet daily period 6 week . Subjects consume randomly assign beverage twice per day breakfast dinner meal . All subject ask come Center week receive week 's supply beverage . Additionally , fast clinical laboratory variable , anthropometrics , vital sign measurement assess bi-weekly visit Week 3 Week 5 . Participants undergo procedure end Week 6 : fasting blood sample collection analysis insulin , glucose , oxidative inflammatory marker , OGTT ass glucose handling , well FMD procedure ass endothelial function response 6 week either Placebo Strawberry treatment . Subjects require visit Center 4 week end intervention period ( Week 10 ) , time undergo last anthropometrics vital sign measurement , 4 hour OGTT , FMD procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must meet ONE MORE criterion ( 1 ) ( 5 ) associate insulin resistance along criterion list ( 6 ) ( 9 ) : 1 . Blood glucose concentration between140199 mg/dL 2hr OGTT . 2 . Elevated fast glucose ( 110 mg/dL≤ Fasting blood glucose &lt; 126 mg/dL ) 3 . Elevated fasting insulin ( &gt; 75th percentile cutoff 13.13 μU/mL ) 4 . Insulin resistance define homeostasis model assessment method insulin resistance ( HOMAIR ) ( glucose [ millimoles per liter ] × insulin [ microunits per milliliter ] /22.5 ) value least 2.5 . 5 . Waist circumference ≥ 110 cm many epidemiology study show waist circumference may relate insulin resistance . 6 . Nonsmokers 7 . Not take medication would interfere outcomes study , i.e . lipid lower medication , antiinflammatory drug , dietary supplement 8 . 18 year age old 9 . No clinical evidence cardiovascular , metabolic , respiratory , renal , gastrointestinal hepatic disease Pregnant and/or lactating . Allergy intolerance strawberry dairy product . Current regular consumption strawberry &gt; 2 serving per day . Fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL . Subjects identify elevated fast blood glucose level advise contact primary care physician appropriate followup care . Taking counter antioxidant supplement supplement may interfere study procedure endpoint . Subjects unusual dietary habit ( e.g . pica ) . Actively lose weight try lose weight ( unstable body weight fluctuation &gt; 5 kg 60 day period ) . Excessive exerciser train athlete . Subjects document atherosclerotic disease , inflammatory disease , diabetes mellitus , systemic disease . Addicted drug and/or alcohol . Medically documented psychiatric neurological disturbance . Smoker ( past smoker may allow cessation &gt; 2 year ) .</criteria>
