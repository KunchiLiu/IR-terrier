	<brief_title>Early Standardized Weight Bearing Utilizing Immersion Therapy Following Periarticular Lower Extremity Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractures low extremity common injury lead temporary permanent disability.13 Fracture healing , regardless treatment , multifactorial process influence time , biomechanics , host biology ( among variable ) . The degree , timing , progression , type weight bear fracture involve pelvis low extremity area debate clinical management broad spectrum orthopedic injuries.1,2,4-9,11,15 Periarticular fracture weight bear joint area particular interest regard post-operative weight bearing due prolong period patient must non-weight bearing surgery . Some degree impairment inevitable traumatic injury . The majority author write post-fracture weight bearing determine time extent weight bear effect fracture healing , small number author publish result demonstrate opposite.14,16,19,21 In addition potential impact heal rate , limited non-weight bearing carry add insult loss bone density muscle mass.3,10,12,17,20,22 Traditionally , patient periarticular fracture require non-weight bearing effect extremity 12 week . At institution , patient require remain non-weight bearing 10 week , follow progressively increased level weight bear accord patient tolerance . One orthopaedic traumatologists institution use immersion therapy allow patient periarticular fracture begin weight bearing prior ten-week mark . Immersion therapy require patient perform physical therapy , trained therapist , swim pool . The use pool post-fracture care may able provide structure standardized partial weight-bearing environment could allow early mobilization . It also potential improve clinical outcome mitigate least loss bone muscle mass post-operative period ; thereby , potentially speed functional recovery . Immersion therapy currently utilized on-site University Utah Orthopedic Center variety diagnosis , include post-fracture care . There essentially orthopedic literature regard immersion therapy management post-fracture rehabilitation regard early weight bearing . Specifically , investigator aware clinical outcome study investigate standardize early weight bearing protocol follow periarticular fracture low extremity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion patient population study consist male female adult , least 18 year old , treat periarticular fracture low extremity . The periarticular fracture include study : acetabular , tibial plateau , tibial plafond fracture . Age &lt; 18 year Wound complication deem unsafe immersion . Multiple extremity articular fracture Other injury preclude safe participation physical therapy .</criteria>
