	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis relentlessly progressive disease responsible deaths 5000 people UK year . At present , despite dramatic increase clinical trial last decade , license treatment IPF . The pathogenesis condition remain incompletely understood , nonetheless good evidence suggest condition arises consequence aberrant wound heal response genetically susceptible individual . Basic science research IPF identify wide range potential treatment target . However , many case develop compound act target , role normal wound healing , limited possibility major systemic side effect . The lung highly amenable topical therapy form inhale drug preparation route utilised treatment majority respiratory disease . The inhaled route offer number important potential advantage administration therapy patient IPF . Firstly , limit systemic exposure drug , inhale route offer potential achieve high lung dos drug might otherwise cause systemic toxicity . Secondly , inhale treatment may effectively reach area abnormality IPF , namely hyperplastic epithelium underlie fibroblastic focus . Thirdly , inhale route offer alternative parenteral administration compound poorly absorb gastro-intestinal tract e.g . monoclonal antibody . It note however , fibrosis IPF develop peripherally involve alveolar interstitium terminal bronchiole . Furthermore , disease cause architectural destruction distortion lung liable alter normal laminar flow air ( inhaled particle ) bronchial tree . It therefore , mean certain possible deliver inhale therapy directly region fibrosis IPF . The feasibility deliver inhaled drug IPF previously study . This research assess effect particle size inhale particle deposition relate pharmacokinetic profile salbutamol aim validate potential inhaled route IPF . This study important precursor development specific topical therapy patient IPF .</brief_summary>
