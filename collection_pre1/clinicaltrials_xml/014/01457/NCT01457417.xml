	<detailed_description>Part A trial consist 4 treatment arm DKN-01 . It dose escalation study patient multiple myeloma advance solid tumor . Patients must refractory intolerant standard/approved therapy ( y ) . At dose level , 3 subject treat . If none 3 subject develop dose limit toxicity minimum 4 week treatment , subsequent dose escalation proceed accord schedule . Part B consist dose confirmation patient NSCLC . Patients must refractory intolerant standard/approved therapy ( y ) . Approximately 15 patient may enrol Part B .</detailed_description>
