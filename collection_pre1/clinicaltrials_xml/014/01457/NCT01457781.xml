	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide/INOpulse DS Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study determine inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) give special delivery device ( INOpulse® DS ) safe efficacious treat Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) . Medical literature clinical experience suggest iNO pulse dos 0.013 0.1 mg/kg per hour 1 month 2+ year appear safe suggest efficacy treatment pulmonary hypertension . There two part study . In Part 1 ( week 0 week 16 ) , objectives determine safety , tolerability , efficacy , exploratory objective two different dos iNO deliver pulsed delivery device symptomatic subject PAH remain symptomatic due PAH approve PAH monotherapy combination approve PAH therapy . In Part 2 ( week 17 end study Part 2 [ EOS Part 2 ] ) , objective compile data long-term effect iNO safety , tolerability , clinical hemodynamic measure .</detailed_description>

A confirmed diagnosis Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 ( PAH ) either idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) , heritable PAH , anorexigeninduced PAH , associate PAH ( APAH ) connective tissue disease ( CTD ) , APAH repair simple congenital systemic pulmonary shunt ( i.e. , atrial septal defect [ ASD ] , ventricular septal defect [ VSD ] and/or patent ductus arteriosus [ PDA ] ; complete repair least 1 year prior Screening ) APAH human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 3 . Confirmation PAH diagnosis time Baseline RHC accord follow definition : mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg rest , concomitant mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( mPCWP ) , mean leave atrial pressure ( mLAP ) , leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ( LVEDP ) ≤ 15 mmHg PVR ≥ 240 dynes.sec/cm5 4 . 6MWD least 100 meter great 450 meter 5 . The subject receiving least one approve PAH therapy clinically symptomatic PAH ( e.g. , onset increase dyspnea exertion , dizziness , nearsyncope , syncope , chest pain peripheral edema ) 6 . Background PAH medication dos ( include calcium channel blockade use treat PAH ) must stable least 12 week prior Screening 7 . If background conventional therapy ( e.g. , digoxin , diuretic , supplemental oxygen , anticoagulation ) , must start least 30 day prior Screening stable dose least 30 day except anticoagulation dose 8 . If previously treat endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , phosphodiesterase5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitor , prostacyclin prostacyclin analog longer say treatment Screening ( per inclusion criterion ) , subject must say treatment &gt; 90 day Screening 9 . If previously treat calcium channel blocker treatment PAH long calcium channel blocker treatment Screening ( per inclusion criterion ) , subject must calcium channel blocker treatment &gt; 90 day Screening 10 .
