	<brief_title>Intensified Conditioning Regimen With High-Dose-Etoposide Allo-HSCT Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first decade new millennium , multiple study begin change think treatment adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . In pediatric patient cure rate range 80 % 90 % attainable . While adult patient ALL 90 % complete remission ( CR ) modern chemotherapy , patient relapse , leukemia-free survival 3 7 year follow-up large series range 30 % 40 % . The poor outcome chemotherapy adult ALL compare child relate multiple factor , include poor tolerance intensive course chemotherapy high incidence poor prognostic subtypes ALL Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL low incidence favorable subtypes ( 12 ; 21 ) . Evolving paradigms treatment adult ALL include application intense pediatric regimen treatment adolescent young adult ( AYA ) optimization allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) cure patient . Adult regimens typically less intense pediatric regimen . The Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) Children 's Cancer Group ( CCG ) first ask whether AYA age 16 20 fare differently whether treat pediatric protocol . The result study demonstrated although complete remission rate identical AYAs treat CALGB CCG trial , AYAs 63 % event-free survival ( EFS ) 67 % OS 7 year CCG trial compare 34 % 46 % , respectively , CALGB trial . These result prompt new study pediatric ALL regimen adapt treatment young adult . With short follow-up , GRAALL-2003 report suggest EFS OS outcomes range 60 % . This improved outcome pronounce standard-risk patient donor OS 5 year 69 % . On time , previous research confirm effect safety FA-intensified conditioning regimen relapse refractary leukemia . Based mention , speculate VP-16-intensified condition regimen could improve outcome adult ALL . The potential mechanism attribute reduce MRD promote GVL effect via provide enough time-window immuno-reconstitution high-dose preparative regimen .</detailed_description>
