	<detailed_description>Ofatumumab novel immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) 1ĸ lytic monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) specifically bind human CD20 antigen expression restrict B lymphocytes pre-B cell stage plasmacytoid immunoblast stage . A recent trial rituximab demonstrate target B-cells reduces number gadolinium-enhancing ( GdE ) T1 lesion relapse rate Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) . The intravenous ( IV ) formulation ofatumumab show well-tolerated efficacious Phase I/II &amp; III clinical trial within B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( B-CLL ) , non-Hodgkin 's Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) , active Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . A Phase II study ofatumumab Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) subject , OMS115102 ( also know Study GEN414 ) ongoing development protocol . The primary objective OMS115102 protocol investigate safety range dos ( 100mg , 300 mg , 700 mg ) ofatumumab RRMS subject , use IV formulation . The treatment period OMS115102 complete ; currently 4 subject ongoing Individualized Follow Phase . In Week 0 24 period majority subject expose active treatment ofatumumab ( active/placebo ) Cluster Differentiation 19 ( CD19+ ) CD20+ level suppress zero ; recovery start 100 mg 300 mg active/placebo group , approximately , 12 20 week discontinuation dose ofatumumab , respectively . In 700 mg active/placebo group , one subject persistent complete CD19+ suppression Week 24 . In Week 24 48 period , previously expose placebo treat ofatumumab ( placebo/active ) , majority subject treat ofatumumab CD19+ CD20+ cell level suppress zero ( mm3 ) within one week . Recovery start subject 100 mg placebo/active group approximately 16 week ( subject ' first infusion ) . In 300 mg 700 mg placebo/active group , subject except one ( 700 mg ) persistent complete CD19+ suppression Week 48 . This study evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) efficacy investigate safety ofatumumab use subcutaneous ( SQ ) formulation subject RRMS . This Phase II study multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose range study subject RRMS . Randomization stratify base absence presence GdE brain lesion present screening . The core 54 week period study make 6-week Screening Phase , 24-week Treatment Phase , 24-week Follow-up Phase . Subjects attend clinic total approximately twelve time ( include Screening ) core 54-week period study . Subjects remain enrolled participate study Screening though end 24-Week Follow-Up Period ( Week 48 Visit ) consider completers . Upon completion withdrawal core study period , subject follow Individualized Follow-up Phase . Subjects return clinic every 12 week B-cell count safety assessment . Subjects remain Individualized Follow-up ( IFU ) CD19+ B-lymphocyte count recover LLN baseline ( &lt; LLN ) ; OR B-cell count recover Week 120 visit ( 100 week last possible treatment dose Week 20 ) , either B-cell count circulate IgG &gt; LLN baseline level ( &lt; LLN ) . Male female subject diagnosis RRMS screen eligibility study . All non-MRI screening procedure generally complete within 14 day inform consent give . To extent possible , investigator verify subject meet non MRI-related entry criterion perform screen MRIs . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion centrally randomize study Baseline Visit ( Week 0 ) receive one follow treatment arm : SQ administration ofatumumab 3 mg , 30 mg , 60 mg every 12 week , 60 mg every 4 week , placebo . Half subject randomize 30 mg group , either 60 mg group , receive 3 mg condition dose Week 0 . Based tolerability observe indication , 3 mg condition dose may produce gradual lysis B-cells , thereby reduce cytokine release reaction initial 30 mg 60 mg dose potentially improve tolerability subject . The Treatment Phase last 24 week subject see 8 time phase . Upon completion discontinuation Treatment Phase , subject enter 24-week Follow-up Phase , receive investigational product . Ideally , MS disease-modifying therapy take period order allow clean analysis safety data potential Cluster Differentiation ( CD ) +19 B-lymphocyte cell immunoglobulin normalization assess . However , start MS disease-modifying therapy consider medically necessary , follow continue completion 24-Week Follow-up Phase . The subject withdrawn study , enter Individualized Follow-up Phase . Upon completion 24-Week Follow-up Phase , subject start MS disease modify therapy ( DMT ) enter Individualized Follow . During Phase , subject return clinic every 12 week B-cell count safety assessment . If subject start MS DMT follow-up phase withdrawn study . To extent possible , subject experience relapse study return immediately clinic evaluation . All MRI scan send central reader analysis . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) evaluate risk relative benefit review safety efficacy information ongoing basis study . Approximately 245 subject screen provide around 196 subject randomization study . Assuming attrition rate 10 % baseline visit six-month treatment visit , provide approximately 176 evaluable subject .</detailed_description>
