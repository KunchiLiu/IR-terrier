	<brief_title>Self-expandable , Fully Covered Metal Stents Biliary Strictures Due Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic treatment benign biliary stricture include placement plastic stent Self-Expandable Metal Stents . Long term result placement single plastic stent disappointing . Better result obtain endoscopic insertion multiple plastic stent . Biliary Self-Expandable Metal Stents use malignant stricture uncover partially cover plastic coating . More recently , fully cover SEMS develop available market due removability propose also benign indication . Uncovered partially covered biliary Self-Expandable Metal Stents chronic pancreatitis-related benign biliary stricture long-term may clog due tissue ingrowth uncovered mesh . Removable fully cover Self-Expandable Metal Stents seem attractive option CP-related BBS , scarce data available literature . The investigator conduct feasibility , prospective , tertiary single-centre trial investigate durable resolution chronic pancreatitis-related benign biliary stricture temporary insertion FC SEMS unflared-ends flared-ends .</detailed_description>
