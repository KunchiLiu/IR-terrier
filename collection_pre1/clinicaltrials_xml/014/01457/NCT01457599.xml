	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate possible mark wire colorectal hepatic metastasis complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Primary investigator want investigate wire mark possibility mark respectively identify lesion . Further investigator want evaluate many patient complete radiologic complete histologic response specimen respectively many specimen definitive histology tumor cell visible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computertomography-guided Wire Marking Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal Cancer common western country . In 2007 Austria 4462 new colorectal cancer diagnose . The common place metastasis liver . Approximately 15 % patient metastasis time diagnosis primary tumor 50 % develop metastases course disease.However 10-25 % patient candidate liver resection . New chemotherapeutics , new target therapy monoclonal antibody well surgical technique improve response rate , resection rate overall survival . Owing improved response rate metastases liver partially respectively completely disappear , lesion visible apparative diagnostic like CT-scan MRI . The question patient ? In literature evidence manage patient . Conservative management would lead reoccurrence metastasis liver . On side surgical management difficult , metastases preoperatively intraoperatively visible resection possible removement great amount healthy tissue . The computer tomography-guided wire marking metastasis liver possibility overcome problem . All patient complete radiologic response metastasis liver metastasis ≤ 1 cm include study ( RECISTE-Criteria ) . On day surgical procedure patient bring interventional radiologist base computer tomography image neoadjuvant chemotherapy lesion mark computer tomography-guided wire ( X-Reidy Breast Lesion Localization Needle , Cook Medical ) . The wire place percutaneously antibiotic prophylaxis . After mark procedure , patient bring operating room resect metastases liver .</detailed_description>
