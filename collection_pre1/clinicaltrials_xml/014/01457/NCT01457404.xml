	<brief_title>Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( ICBT ) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Substance Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research evaluate safety practicality , feasibility , efficacy relatively simple , manual guide integrated cognitive behavioral therapy ( ICBT ) . ICBT ( revise edition formerly call cognitive behavioral therapy posttraumatic stress disorder [ CBT PTSD ] ) design developed delivery counselor employ community addiction treatment program offer conjunction standard community addiction treatment . The investigator complete Stage I Safety &amp; Practicality Study , Feasibility Study Pilot Randomized Controlled Study ( compare ICBT versus control condition ) community addiction treatment study find ICBT safe effective reduce PTSD symptom , improve retention , reduce substance use . The present study propose conduct Stage I study ICBT among Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Operation New Dawn ( OND ) Veterans within Veterans Affairs treatment set . The investigator modify exist ICBT test VA setting , use combine individual group modality . There 3 specific aim study , hypotheses aim : Aim 1 : To test feasibility ICBT OEF/OIF/OND Veterans diagnose PTSD substance use disorder , ass substance use PTSD outcomes 3- 6-month follow-up ( Stage I Phase I : Safety practicality test ; Feasibility Study ) . - This aim test effect ICBT symptom PTSD substance use disorder among return OEF/OIF/OND Veterans see VA clinic . ICBT test 16 Veterans meet criterion PTSD substance use disorder PTSD SATP clinic . The investigator propose ICBT result significant reduction PTSD substance use severity baseline follow-up assessment . - Hypothesis 1 : Participants receive ICBT significant reduction PTSD symptom severity assess Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) score baseline 6-month follow-up assessment . - Hypothesis 2 : Participants receive ICBT significant reduction substance use assess Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) drug alcohol severity composite score baseline 6-month follow-up assessment . Aim 2 : To revise ICBT material protocol base Stage I Phase I finding ( Stage I Phase II ) . -Based experience lesson learn Stage I Phase I , investigator refine improve ICBT approach study method teh Stage I Phase III randomize pilot trial . Aim 3 : To conduct randomize controlled pilot trial compare ICBT plus standard Substance Abuse Treatment Program ( SATP ) PTSD care versus standard SATP PTSD care alone , OEF/OIF/OND Veterans diagnose PTSD substance use disorder , ass substance use PTSD outcomes post treatment 3-month post treatment follow-up ( Stage I Phase III : Randomized Pilot Trial ) . - The efficacy ICBT test among 64 Veterans screen positive disorder randomly assign either ICBT standard treatment . - Hypothesis 1 : Participants receive ICBT plus standard care great reduction PTSD symptom , assess CAPS score baseline follow-up , participant receive standard care alone . - Hypothesis 2 : Participants receive ICBT plus standard care great reduction substance use , assess ASI drug alcohol severity composite score baseline follow-up , compare participant receive standard care alone . Potential subject receive PTSD substance use treatment service Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( PVAMC ) , refer clinician respective clinic participation study . Patients approach clinic staff potential interest study . If wish learn study , research coordinator ( on-site employee ) contact , suitable time arrange , patient engage process inform consent . If consent grant , subject completes baseline assessment . The baseline assessment consist measure gather via interview member research team , self-administered survey complete directly subject , review subject 's medical record extract demographic , substance use , treatment history information , well chart diagnosis . The interview portion assessment consist : - Standardized interview design assess PTSD Axis I DSM-IV substance use disorder : Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV-TR , Patient Edition ( SCID-I/P ) Section E. - A urine screen breathalyzer test alcohol drug . - Standardized follow-back method gathering data recent alcohol drug use : Time-line Follow-back Calendar ( TLFB ) . The self-administered portion assessment consist measure design ass : - Alcohol drug use , well associate problem life area medical , employment , legal , social , psychiatric : Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) . - Depression : Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) . If subject continue meet criterion PTSD ( i.e . CAPS interview confirm diagnosis DSM-IV PTSD , symptom severity 44 high ) , eligible participate . For Stage I Phase I , patient would receive ICBT therapy . For Stage I Phase III , patient would randomize receive either ICBT therapy plus standard treatment , standard treatment . Research assessment also conduct three month six month post baseline assessment . This follow-up assessment consist measure administer baseline , exception SCID interview . The investigator plan enroll approximately 16 subject Stage I Phase I randomize approximately 64 subject Stage I Phase III study . The subject outcome program experience protocol use planning subsequent federal grant application randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
