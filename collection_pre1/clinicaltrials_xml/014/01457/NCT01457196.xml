	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Current prospective cancer patient ; current cancer patient must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis cancer 2 . Tumor tissue available suitable molecular analysis least one follow source : Tissue previously store UNC 's Tissue Procurement Facility ( TPF ) Tissue previous store institution UNCCH , provide investigator determine tumor sample stored appropriate condition inclusion study Patient undergo tissue collection per clinical standard care willing allow specimen surplus tissue divert research purpose Patient undergo tissue collection per clinical standard care willing additional specimen take research Patient willing undergo biopsy purpose research 3 . The following inclusion criterion apply patient undergo biopsy research purpose protocol : â‰¥18 year age Treatment option offer expectation cure , e.g. , advance solid tumor patient metastatic disease . NOTE : This restriction apply biopsy vital organ , e.g. , lung , liver , etc . Appropriate candidate research biopsy base institutional standard target biopsy site 1 . Any condition would make participation protocol unreasonably hazardous patient opinion treat physician 2 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition comorbid condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . 3 . The following exclusion criterion apply enrolled patient undergo biopsy research purpose : 4 . History serious lifethreatening allergic reaction local anesthetic ( i.e . lidocaine , xylocaine ) medication use conscious sedation ( applicable ) . 5 . Requires general anesthesia collection biopsy 6 . Pregnant lactate woman 7 . Active cardiac disease 8 . Patients receive bevacizumab le 6 week prior enrollment study undergo research core biopsy concern potential increase bleed risk delay healing . ( NOTE : Patients receive bevacizumab undergoing research biopsy accessible organ ( e.g . breast , lymph node , skin etc . ) must two week last dose angiogenesis inhibitor ) .</criteria>
