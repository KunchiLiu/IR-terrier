	<brief_summary>Exercise use help prevent slow progression inflammation-related disease ; however , mechanism activity may lower concentration inflammatory marker remain unclear . The melanocortin receptor 1,3 5 ( MC1R , MC3R MC5R ) show function anti-inflammatory manner potential mediate positive immune adaptation associate regular physical activity . Preliminary data suggest MC3R gene expression increase whole blood chronic exercise training . The primary aim current study explore whether change gene expression translates alteration MC1R , MC3R , MC5R monocyte surface expression . The secondary aim examine relationship surface expression receptor circulate inflammatory profile . The investigator recruit 42 untrained , healthy male female age 18-35 yr . Half group place exercise program 15 week . The half serve untrained control subject . In addition basic anthropometric measure , investigator measure concentration inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine ( ELISA ) cell surface expression MC1R , MC3R , MC5R monocytes ( flow cytometry ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abstract : Chronic exercise reduces inflammation , mechanism involve unclear . Recent study show stimulation melanocortin 1 3 receptor ( MC1R MC3R ) immune cell increase anti-inflammatory cytokine production . PURPOSE : To examine influence 12 week resistance training ( RT ) body composition , monocyte cell-surface expression MC1R MC3R circulate marker inflammation . METHODS : Healthy , active male female ( age 20-27 yr ) recruit RT group ( RE ; n = 23 ) active control group ( AC ; n = 19 ) . RE complete 12 week progressive , periodized RT 3d/wk AC maintain normal activity habit . Measures body composition ( DXA ) take blood collect prior ( PRE ) follow intervention period ( POST ) . Blood sample analyze monocyte cell-surface expression MC1R , MC3R , MC5R C-reactive protein ( CRP ) plasma cytokine interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) use flow cytometry ELISAs respectively .</detailed_description>
