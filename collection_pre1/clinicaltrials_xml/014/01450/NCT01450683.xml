	<brief_title>Study Itraconazole Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) Post-chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) also know `` androgen-insensitive '' `` hormone-refractory '' prostate cancer . While numerous therapy impact biochemical response set CRPC , remain unmet medical need , largely express lack durable response . New therapy extend survival patient beyond provide chemotherapy need . It hypothesize triazole antifungal drug itraconazole , activity potent inhibitor Hedgehog ( Hh ) signal pathway via Smoothened ( Smo ) pathway , may provide clinical benefit treatment prostate cancer . The Hh signal pathway critical embryonic developmental pathway whose aberrant activity implicate growth metastasis variety tumor type include prostate cancer . Itraconazole structurally related ketoconazole , demonstrate reduce serum PSA 50 % 20 25 % treated prostate cancer subject . This study assess efficacy basis serum level PSA , establish surrogate endpoint efficacy prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
