	<detailed_description>Probiotics increasingly utilized clinically . As safety health benefit establish , reasonable anticipate probiotic bacteria incorporate grow number clinical regimen , dietary supplement . Extensive vitro R &amp; D investigation Kibow 's laboratory Bacterial strain study mixture patent proprietary strain Streptococcus thermophilus ( KB27 ) , Lactobacillus acidophilus ( KB31 ) Bifidobacterium longum ( KB35 ) . Oral administration bacterial formulation , test 5/6th nephrectomized rat model ( Thomas Jefferson University , Phila. , PA ) minipig model ( Indiana University , Indianapolis , IN ) , decrease blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) serum creatinine ( Scr ) level . Two independent veterinarian investigated effect Kibow Biotics® cat dog ( gender vary body weight ) moderate severe kidney failure .
