	<brief_summary>Q-fever zoonosis cause Coxiella burnetii , intracellular bacterium . Since epidemic outbreak acute Q-fever Holland nearly 4030 people register acute form disease . Knowing 40 % infected people develop symptom , number infect people ( potential candidate chronic Q-fever ) much high . Chronic Q-fever generally manifest couple month year primary infection ( 1-5 % case ) . The clinical presentation life-threatening frequently underdiagnosed disease , endocarditis , infect aneurysm vascular prosthesis chronic Q-fever related pregnancy immunecompromised patient . That 's screen program start endemic area trace patient chronic Q-fever . So eventually , great group patient chronic vascular Q-fever described . In addition , still therapeutic guideline management chronic Q-fever patient vascular chronic Q-fever . Patients aneurysm vascular graft screen chronic Q-fever . Patients chronic Q-fever include follow-up program , additional research treatment start . The initial treatment patient chronic Q-fever doxycycline hydroxychloroquine least 18 month . In addition , patient monitor 3-monthly control , blood sample image do . Parameters complaint , titer , circulate DNA , grow aneurysm , complication etc . investigate . Ultimately , current therapeutic guideline management C. burnetii evaluate also apply patient vascular chronic Q-fever .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Q-fever Patients With Abdominal Aortic Disease ( QAAD-study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Prospective observational survey Domain : Patients abdominal aneurysm central vascular reconstruction endemic area outbreak acute Q-fever . Data collection : In Jeroen Bosch Hospital Bernhoven Hospital patient aneurysm central vascular reconstruction screen Q-fever . Other hospital Holland check Q-fever , suspect patient infect aneurysm prosthesis . A patient chronic Q-fever enter multidisciplinary follow-up program . First , PET/CT-scan provide ( question ; sign infect aneurysm/prosthesis ) chronic Q-fever endocarditis exclude . The patient initially treat doxycycline 2 dd 100mg plaquenil 200mg 3dd least 18 month . A 3-monthly follow-up start , bloodsample , ultrasounds PET/CTscan perform . Data collect SPSS analysis . Definitions ; Past resolve Q-fever : Any IgG phase 2 IgG phase 1 &lt; 1:1024 Chronic Q-fever : IgG phase 1 &gt; = 1:1024</detailed_description>
