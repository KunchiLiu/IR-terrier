	<brief_summary>The Bispectral Index monitor use many operating room provide information anesthesiologist patient 's level consciousness . The Composite Variability Index , Composite Variability Index ( CVI ) , new index may provide anesthesiologist information condition patient . The purpose study determine commonly use anesthetic drug ( rocuronium ) affect CVI measurement differently different dos . Rocuronium muscle relaxant routinely use surgery . It expect group give high dose rocuronium diminish CVI value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Neuromuscular Blockade Composite Variability Index ( CVI ) During Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize patient one four dose rocuronium : rocuronium , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 milligram per kilo body weight ; last dose standard amount adult . It expect group give high dose rocuronium diminish CVI value . By include intermediate dos , information function CVI state less full muscle relaxation , paralysis , obtain . This information critically important development composite variability index , general anesthesia patient usually maintain state le full paralysis . If CVI response stimulation intermediate group similar group receive rocuronium , monitor may find wide clinical applicability . If response similar maximal rocuronium group , index may reliable state muscle relaxant , greatly limit clinical utility . Subjects receive propofol remifentanil infusion case . These commonly use medication anesthesia . The subject also randomize two additional group . One group receive remifentanil infusion 2ng ml-1 group receive 8ng ml-1 remifentanil infusion . Both dose acceptable often used standard clinical care . The propofol infusion adjust keep BIS number 45-60 . The anesthesiologist able see CVI value . The time certain intraoperative event , intubation incision , record . All subject receive morphine bolus ( 0.10-0.15 mg/kg ) towards end reduce post-operative pain , per standard clinical care . As subject wake , time eye open orientation record . The subject rate pain numerical pain scale quality emergence assess . Upon arrival post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , subject ask rate pain use pain scale . The pain score evaluate every 10 minute half hour , every hour discharge PACU .</detailed_description>
