	<brief_summary>A 15-gene lung signature create identify predictive prognostic biomarkers Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . The 15-gene signature validate use microarray platform fresh frozen tumor tissue place NSCLC patient high risk low risk cohort significantly different survival . Using fresh frozen tissue challenging , study attempt simplify process migrate 15-gene signature fresh frozen two alternative tissue format : Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded ( FFPE ) RNAlater . The gene expression different tissue format compare see fresh frozen tissue result similar alternative tissue format .</brief_summary>
