	<detailed_description>Boswellic acid ( BAs ) , main biologically active compound frankincense , orally available know exhibit anti-inflammatory activity . This Phase IIa bicentric baseline-to-treatment study standardize frankincense extract Boswelan test safety , tolerability efficacy BAs RR-MS patient . Following 3-month screen phase , patient receive individualized dose find identify high well tolerated BOSWELAN dose patient . The primary outcome treatment phase ( Stage 3 ) first compare mean Gd-enhancing lesion number occur 4 month baseline mean Gd-enhancing lesion number occur month 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 treatment patient treat dose least 800 mg t.i.d .</detailed_description>
