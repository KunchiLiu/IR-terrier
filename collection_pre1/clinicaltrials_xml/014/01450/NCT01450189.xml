	<brief_summary>This pilot study assess feasibility potential public health benefit behavioral antiretroviral intervention acute HIV infection . Central Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize deliver behavioral antiretroviral intervention acutely infected person reduce onward transmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Key Link Transmission Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HIV epidemic sub-Saharan Africa severe continue grow . In urban area Malawi , 19 % pregnant woman seek antenatal care 15.6 % Malawians age 15-49 year infect HIV 2007 . Prevention intervention prevent onward transmission HIV urgently need . Persons acute HIV infection ( AHI ) may responsible substantial proportion onward transmission HIV infection . AHI characterize unfettered replication HIV `` ramp viremia '' . The high concentration HIV blood genital secretion remain elevated 10-12 week decline level observe establish infection . These high level HIV shed genital tract likely produce efficient sexual transmission proportion virion infectious may substantially high acute compare chronic infection . Consequently , probability transmission unprotected intercourse AHI high . Identifying person AHI intervene reduce onward transmission represent tantalize , unproven , opportunity HIV prevention . To maximal impact , prevention program target AHI must identify substantial number acutely infected person intervene quickly minimize onward transmission . An effective immediate intervention would require behavioral modification limit sexual partner unprotected sex act , biological intervention reduce infectious viral burden genital secretion . This first study pilot combine behavioral biomedical intervention individual AHI reduce onward transmission HIV .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary participant : Acute HIV1 infection Men woman age great than/= 18 year . Intention remain Lilongwe area duration study . Ability willingness participant provide inform consent . Willingness provide contact/locator information , contact , ask return AHI result . Partner Participants : Referred primary participant present referral card . Had vaginal anal sex primary participant within 12 week prior primary participant 's enrol Men woman age great than/=18 year . remain Lilongwe area duration study . Ability willingness participant provide inform consent . Primary Participants : HIV infection base two positive HIV antibody rapid test time screen . HIVnegative base one antibody rapid test HIV RNA PCR test . Serious illness , include tuberculosis opportunistic infection , require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization . Active drug alcohol use dependence . Current imprisonment involuntary incarceration . Any condition opinion study investigator would compromise safety study participant study staff , would prevent proper conduct study . Partner Participants : Active drug alcohol use dependence . Current imprisonment involuntary incarceration medical facility psychiatric physical illness . Exclusion Receipt Antiretroviral Drugs BIA Arm Note : A key component pilot study estimate potential effect ARVs acute infection apply large population scale.In effect , pilot study view pilot effectiveness trial . Consequently , randomize eligible participant one three arm . If , however , person receive ARVs variety medicallyrelated reason , person remain BIA arm , receive ARVs . Women reproductive potential refuse use least one form contraception ( see ) , remain BIA arm receive ARVs . Similarly , person randomize BI arm attend session remain BI arm . Persons randomize BIA follow condition exclude receive ARVs , remain BIA group purpose analysis . Laboratory value obtain Day 0 prior initiate ARVs subsequent visit Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 300/mm3 Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL Platelet count &lt; 40,000/mm3 Aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase &gt; 5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) &lt; 60 mL/min Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity Positive serum urine pregnancy test Day 0 . Breastfeeding Refusal use least one method contraception , woman reproductive potential . Acceptable form contraception include : condom ( male female ) without spermicidal agent , diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonalbased contraceptive . Women meet reproductive potential criterion may receive study drug without use contraception . Known allergy/sensitivity hypersensitivity component study drug ( ) formulation . Requirement current medication prohibit study drug .</criteria>
