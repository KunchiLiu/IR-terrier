	<brief_summary>Ureteroscopy ( URS ) minimally invasive procedure management renal stone . URS often involve concomitant indwell ureteral stent . Placements stent include pain , bladder irritability , infection , migration , encrustation stone . Pain one significant problem ureteral stent . There satisfactory measure deal problem . A novel approach manage pain load drug onto ureteral stent deliver drug urinary tract control release rate . Lidocaine proven effective management pain associate interstitial cystitis . This agent potential management post-URS pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraureteral Lidocaine Post-Ureteroscopy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat ureteroscopy ( URS ) ureteral renal calculus require ureteral stent time URS randomize receive intraureteral instillation alkalinize lidocaine hydrochloride ( study group ) normal saline ( control group ) immediately follow procedure assess safety effectiveness alleviate pain stent symptom . Thousands removable stent place patient ' ureter ( tubes connect kidney bladder ) year Canada . These plastic stent allow kidney drain swell kidney stone surgery otherwise obstruct . Studies report 80 % patient painful symptom indwell ureteral stent . This study attempt show local anesthetic inject directly ureter stent placement reduce stent pain . Recent study show infuse lidocaine bicarbonate ( local anesthetic ) painful bladder safe , patient ' symptom improve dramatically . This result inspire innovative idea inject similar solution kidney ureter ( line bladder ) numb area sufficiently decrease stent relate pain . The study randomly select half patient receive injection non-irritating salt water ( placebo ) , half injection pH buffer lidocaine stent place . Both patient physician blind assignment treatment placebo . The investigator compare pain score post operatively . If successful , future researcher may use lidocaine drug elude stent ameliorate pain .</detailed_description>
