	<brief_summary>Oxaliplatin ( Ox ) part treatment regimens colorectal cancer . However , may induce side effect , specific injury peripheral nerve call neuropathy . Ox-induced neuropathy frequently painful . The presence pain administration may hamper full chemotherapeutic treatment patient colorectal cancer receive agent . Recently , suggest appearance acute neuropathy oxaliplatin ( Ox ) infusion could predict distal polyneuropathy see month treatment . These two adverse event related Ox treatment probably share different mechanistic background . However , recent experimental data suggest type peripheral neuropathy able induce central sensitization , major step occurrence chronic pain . Pregabalin molecule use teat neuropathic pain since diminish peripheral sensitization see painful condition . Recently , also show pregabalin use treat neuropathic pain related Ox treatment . In present study , test hypothesis Pregabalin administrate exclusively three day three day Ox infusion able prevent occurrence pain secondary acute chronic Ox-associated neuropathy . In classical FLOX chemotherapeutic regimen , Ox infuse nine session six-month period . Patients follow year nerve conduction test , quantitative sensory evaluation , pain , quality life functional scale use assess impact strategy prevention pain . If strategy prove work , information major impact cancer prognosis patient colorectal cancer since Ox able administer full dose , limited neuropathic side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate The Efficacy Safety Of Pregabalin In Prevention , Reduction Oxaliplatin-Induced Painful Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . OBJECTIVES 1.1 . Primary Objectives The primary objective study evaluate efficacy co-administration Pregabalin oxaliplatin infusion reduce appearance acute late onset oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy patient colorectal cancer . 1.2 . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study follow : - To compare pain intensity interference two treatment arm - To compare safety profile two treatment arm - To compare quality life two treatment arm - To compare percentage patient neuropathy two treatment group - To compare intensity neuropathy relate oxaliplatin two arm - To compare small fiber function positive sensory sign treatment Pregabalin - To compare mood ( depression anxiety ) treatment Pregabalin treatment arm - To assess association cumulative oxaliplatin dose time painful neuropathy peripheral sensory neuropathy diagnosis , pain intensity , pain interference small fiber function . TREATMENT PLAN 2.1 Pregabalin Administration Treatment administer outpatient basis . Reported adverse event potential risk describe Section 7 . Appropriate dose modification Pregabalin describe Section 6 . No investigational commercial agent therapy describe may administer intent treat patient 's oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy . Patients receive either Pregabalin placebo three day three day follow OX infusion ( week 1 , 3 , 5 three cycle , total nine session ) . The total daily dose Pregabalin flexible first dose , , fix dose set individual . Before first Ox dose , patient start 75mg bid follow telephone contact research nurse instruct optimize dose Pregabalin every two day accord magnitude profile side effect . The minimum daily dose allow entry study 150mg/day upon first Ox infusion . Such `` guide '' dose escalation perform first Ox infusion last four day . Thereafter , maximum tolerate dose use first Ox infusion use three follow day rest study . The protocol perform placebo group . After sign informed consent agree participate protocol , patient undergo `` guided '' Pregabalin dose escalation four day . Then , receive Pregabalin three day follow first Ox infusion . Thereafter , receive Pregabalin dosage six day eight next Ox infusion session ie. , start three day end third day Ox infusion session ( D-3 D+3 ) 2.2 Duration Therapy In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue 3 cycle FLOX ( totalize nine oxaliplatin infusion ) one follow criterion applies : Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , Patient decide withdraw study , General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . 2.3 FLOX administration Treatment fluorouracil plus leucovorin oxaliplatin ( FLOX ) 28 , 29 administer outpatient basis . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) treatment weekly 6 week 8-week cycle three cycle . Chemotherapy FLOX give 3 cycle treatment arm . FLOX regimen include : - Oxaliplatin administer dose 85mg/m2 IV week 1 , 3 , 5 8-week cycle three cycle . - 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) administer dose 500mg/m2 IV bolus weekly 6 week ( week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . - Leucovorin 20 mg/m2 IV administer week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . Drugs administer chemotherapy : Dexamethasone 20 mg IV Ondansetron 8mg IV administer chemotherapy administration . Dexamethasone administered week 1 , 3 , 5 . Ondansetron administer week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . Drugs administer chemotherapy : Patients also receive dexamethasone 4 mg P.O . BID three day ondansetron 8 mg P.O . 8 hour ( necessary ) dose Oxaliplatin ( week 1 , 3 , 5 ) . 2.4 Duration Follow-up Patients follow 6 month removal study death , whichever occur first . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event . 2.5 Criteria study withdraw After fulfil inclusion criterion present exclusion criterion , start protocol , patient remove least one condition bellow meet : 1 . Voluntary consent withdraw patient , due reason ; 2 . The patient consider non compliant protocol ( ie . three absence regular protocol visit failure take Pregabalin two treatment session oxaliplatin . In case removal , patient data reason removal record .</detailed_description>

For reason , woman childbearing men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . History exposure neurotoxic chemotherapy Know Concomitant clinical condition impair peripheral nerve function , Symptoms sign suggestive peripheral neuropathy neuropathic pain . Current peripheral neuropathy NCICTCAE , version 3.0 Grade ≥ 1 . Inadequate organ function , evidence follow laboratory result within 1 week prior randomization : Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Positive blood beta HCG test woman , woman breast feed Assessed investigator unable unwilling comply requirement protocol History receive investigational treatment within 28 day randomization Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Pregabalin know hypersensitivity study drug . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement</criteria>
