	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Eluting Stent Long SFA Obstruction : A Prospective , Randomized Comparison With Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Chronic low limb ischemia due atherosclerosis cause significant morbidity especially elderly : prevalence asymptomatic obstructive peripheral atherosclerosis among 40-74 old 4-22 % . The prevalence milder symptomatic manifestation , intermittent claudication among 40 year old men 1 % among 70 year old 7 % . In 10 % patient ischemia worsen threat vitality limb . Although intermittent claudication benign prognosis often treat conservatively , severe form extensive arterial obstruction require revascularization , either open surgical endovascular . Surgical bypass operation currently standard reference treat long SFA obstruction . Up 81 % two-year patency appreciate bypass good quality sapheneous vein . If synthetic graft use long term patency somewhat low , 67 % accord systematic review ( Klinkert et al 2004 ) . The long term patency rate infrainguinal balloon angioplasty ( PTA ) vary largely different study . At 1 year , primary patency rate 47 % 86 % , three year 27 % 69 % , six year 23 % 36 % report literature . Highly variable mostly poor patency rate , 22 64 % 6-12 month report use subintimal angioplasty treatment femoral femoropopliteal lesion . ( Met et al . 2008 ) In femoropopliteal region , highly variable 1-year primary patency rate 22 % 81 % various stent report ( Matsi et al 1994 , Sapoval et al 1992 , Grimm et al 2001 , Lugmayr et al 2002 ) . In three randomised study , although primary success rate stent placement high balloon angioplasty alone , long-term patency improve use stent ( Cejna et al 2001 , Grimm 2001 ) . A meta-analysis reveal similar patency rate balloon dilation stent implantation ( 34 ) . The author large randomize multicenter comparison femoropopliteal PTA balloon expand stent placement 154 treat limb summarise beneficial effect stent rescue PTA failure ( 54 ) . In one study three year primary patency rate 76 % obtain primary stenting relatively short , less 6 cm long lesion ( Lugmayr et al 2002 ) . However , midterm restenosis long-segment femoropopliteal stenting remain problem . In recent single-center observational study long segment ( median length 16 cm ) cover nitinol stent initial failure PTA , primary patency 54 % one year . Stent femoropopliteal artery expose unique long term stress form repeat compression , flexion torsion probably reason recent study reveal stent fracture 50 % nitinol stent 1 year placement ( Schneinert et al 2005 ) 19 % Wallstents mean 43 month placement ( Sclager et al 2005 ) . The fracture seem associate poorer patency common long stent . Drug elute stent show great promise coronary artery intervention . One drug , sirolimus , natural macrocyclic lactone potent immunosuppressive antimitotic action , try also femoral artery . Sirolimus-eluting self-expanding nitinol SMART stent compare small ( 57 patient ) randomize , double-blind multi-center study bare metal stent ( SIROCCO II trial ) treat femoral artery lesion average length 8 cm ( Duda et al 2005 ) . Exceptionally low angiographically verify binary restenosis rate 7.7 % register bare metal stent group . Although restenosis rate zero le mean late loss diameter drug stent group difference reach statistical difference . Paclitaxel mitotic inhibitor another antiproliferative agent widely use , effective agent drug elute stent reduce restenosis coronary circulation . Paclitaxel bind specifically beta-tubulin subunit microtubule appear antagonize disassembly key cytoskeletal protein ; action result accumulation microtubule bundle aberrant microtubular derive structure mitotic phase cell cycle . Zilver PTX ( Cook Medical ) paclitaxel-eluting stent design SFA . It nitinol stent coat paclitaxel , polymer binder . A recent prospective , randomize trial report significantly well 24-month event-free survival among patient receive PTX stent among treated PTA ( 86,6 % vs. 77.6 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) . Primary patency 24 month PTX stent group 74.8 % vs 32.4 % PTA group . ( Dake , LINC 2011 ) . PURPOSE AND STUDY RATIONALE To compare Paclitaxel elute Zilver PTX stent ( Cook INC ) bypass surgery use PTFE graft proximal popliteal artery treatment long SFA obstruction prospective , randomize , Finnish multi center trial consecutive claudicant chronic critical ischemia patient . Bypass synthetic graft instead autogeneous vein use reference standard difficulty standardize quality available vein bypass do proximal popliteal artery graft type give similar result . The aim randomize altogether 400 patient two year five university 2-3 central hospital . The power analysis study base non-inferiority hypothesis , i.e . show paclitaxel elute stent inferior bypass surgery 24 month patency . With accepted marginal equality 5 % , assume surgical group patency 75 % non-inferiority margin 10 % use 1:1 randomization sample size power 80 % detect non-inferiority test treatment 590 ( 295/295 ) . PATIENT RECRUITMENT Consecutive patient fulfil inclusion criterion ask study vascular surgeon interventional radiologist diagnostic imaging study . A consensus vascular surgeon interventional radiologist require : elective patient acquire weekly vascular meeting urgent patient consultation . The patient provide additional compensation participation normal travel expense clinical visit pay . The patient ` identity personal study data available researcher trial . Normal clinical patient insurance apply . PREOPERATIVE IMAGING AND VASCULAR LAB MR-angio , CT angio , catheter angio ( DSA ) perform plan therapy . Ankle brachial index measured.. INTERVENTIONS Balloon angioplasty perform stent placement . Stenting do healthy-to-healthy segment . Surgery perform use PTFE graft distal distal anastomosis knee popliteal artery . POSTOPERATIVE MEDICATION Stent group : ASA 100 mgx1 , Simvastatin , Clopidogrel 300 mgx1 , 75 mgx1 6 month Surgery : ASA 100 mgx1 , Simvastatin POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW- UP AB-index duplex ultrasound study perform patient discharge . Clinical visit vascular surgeon schedule 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month Ankle-brachial index measurement duplex US study . STUDY COORDINATION AND MONITORING The main investigator trial professor Hannu Manninen , Kuopio University Hospital . The investigator KUH M.Ds . Kimmo Mäkinen , Petri Saari , Jussi Kärkkäinen . The main investigator Helsinki , Oulu , Tampere , Turku University Hospitals Jukka Perälä , Kimmo Lappalainen , Janne Korhonen , Riitta Rautio , correspondingly . Randomization perform centralize study coordinator ( Marja-Liisa Sutinen , Kuopio ) Analysis image study perform core lab . The trial possibly monitor , perform authorized person coordinate research unit Kuopio University Hospital . STUDY ENDPOINTS Study end point determine accord CIRSE/SVS standard . Primary endpoint : Patency 24 month follow-up objective mean aid AB-index measurement duplex US measurement . Secondary endpoint : Primary success assist primary success register patient discharge . Complications classify minor major . 30-day mortality . Target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) , define revascularization procedure , percutaneous surgical , involve target lesion . AFS ( amputation free survival ) Economical analysis direct indirect cost . Life quality analysis . DATA ANALYSIS Randomization perform coordinated common research coordinator participate center .

Primary procedural success complication define accord establish EVS/CIRSE guideline . Cumulative patency rate calculate Kaplan-Meier method statistical difference survival curve determine mean log-rank test . Quality life analysis do use RAND-36 questionnaire .
