	<brief_summary>Background : New research criterion diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) recently develop enable early diagnosis AD pathophysiology rely emerge biomarkers . To enable efficient allocation health care resource , evidence need support decision maker adoption emerge biomarkers clinical practice . The research goals 1 ) ass diagnostic test accuracy ( current clinical diagnostic work-up emerge biomarkers Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) , 2 ) perform cost-consequence analysis 3 ) ass long-term cost-effectiveness economic model . Methods/design : In cohort design 304 consecutive patient suspect primary neurodegenerative disease approach four academic memory clinic follow two year . Clinical data data quality life data , cost emerge biomarkers gather . Diagnostic test accuracy determine relate clinical practice new research criterion diagnose reference diagnosis . The clinical practice diagnosis baseline reflect consensus procedure among expert use clinical information ( biomarkers ) . The diagnosis base new research criterion reflect decision rule combine clinical biomarker information . The reference diagnosis determine consensus procedure among expert base clinical information course symptoms two-year time period . A decision analytic model build combine available evidence different resource among ( accuracy ) result study , literature expert opinion ass long-term cost-effectiveness emerge biomarkers . Discussion : Several multi-centre trial study relative value new biomarkers early evaluation AD relate disorder . The uniqueness study assessment resource utilization quality life enable economic evaluation . The study result generalizable population patient refer memory clinic due memory problem .</brief_summary>
