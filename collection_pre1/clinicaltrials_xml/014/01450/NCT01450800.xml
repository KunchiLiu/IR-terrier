	<brief_title>Suppressive Therapy With Oral Antibiotics Prevention Postoperative Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population Participants recruit patient plan undergo gynecologic surgery attend surgeon Division Urogynecology Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) . After enrollment randomization , participant take study drug daily start post-operative day one continue participant stop catheterize one week surgery . The participant also complete daily diary one week surgery record catheterization study drug additional antibiotic medication take . We follow patient total three week surgery monitor treatment UTI . At three week surgery observation period participant complete . Sample Size Under assumption 80 % power alpha error 0.05 , would need 156 subject demonstrate 66 % reduction risk UTI ( i.e . 28 % 10 % ) undergoing prophylactic antibiotic treatment . Therefore , aim recruit total 175 participant account participant dropout . Study Definitions For study purpose , post-operative catheterization define include patient hospitalize post-operatively indwell Foley catheter well patient discharge either intermittent self-catheterization ( ISC ) indwell Foley catheter . The decision catheterize determine type surgical procedure , need inpatient stay void trial result . Void trial conduct follow : bladder backfilled 300cc normal saline , catheter remove patient prompt void immediately , void complete , ( PVR ) post-void residual volume measure . The patient pass void trial void 200cc total volume PVR le 100cc . Our primary outcome treatment UTI within first three week surgery define clinically . A patient consider receive treatment UTI receive antibiotic therapy clinically suspect culture-proven urinary tract infection ( i.e . empirically give upon development urinary symptom prescribe base urinalysis urine culture result ) within first three week surgery . Data Collection Demographic characteristic , operative data post-operative data collect . Prior discharge surgery patient undergo void trial per standard procedure unless receive indwelling Foley catheter overnight hospitalization . Post-operatively subject give catheterization diary record day catheterization day antibiotic therapy . All subject instruct call clinical office report urinary complaint and/or treatment UTI . Information collect electronic medical record regard office visit , urine culture perform treatment UTI post-operative period . Data enter de-identified study database analysis PI study coordinator blind participant randomization . Subject Randomization Blinding Study participant randomize prophylactic treatment versus treatment via computerized randomization scheme IDS time enrollment . Patients blind treatment utilization placebo tablet . Adverse Events Nitrofurantoin FDA approve treatment UTI . We use prophylactic dose monitor adverse event . Adverse event report per protocol . A safety monitoring designee perform review designate basis throughout study . Study Costs There additional cost patient participation study . No additional laboratory test perform result participation .</detailed_description>
