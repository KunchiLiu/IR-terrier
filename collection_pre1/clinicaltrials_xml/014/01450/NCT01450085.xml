	<brief_summary>The specific aim project : ( 1 ) compare impact use routine screening GeneXpert algorithm TB case detection Tuberculosis ( TB ) - HIV-related outcome ; ( 2 ) compare impact use routine screening GeneXpert algorithm exclusion TB prior initiation IPT ART TB- HIV-related outcome ; ( 3 ) ass relative cost-effectiveness routine screening GeneXpert algorithm TB case detection exclusion TB . The GeneXpert `` disruptive technology '' 10 could allow TB/HIV program resource-limited setting leapfrog solid liquid culture-based TB diagnostic algorithm , remove key barrier scale ICF IPT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV tuberculosis ( TB ) , along malaria , lead infectious cause death worldwide sub-Saharan Africa.1 In 2008 , 2 million death AIDS 1.8 million death TB worldwide.2 , 3 The HIV epidemic fuel increase incidence , prevalence mortality due TB past 3 decade . 15 % TB case HIV co-infected worldwide.34 78 % HIV-infected TB case Africa.3 TB lead cause death opportunistic infection among person live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) . The HIV epidemic challenge time-tested TB control method fail high HIV prevalence settings.5 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend Three I 's - intensified case-finding TB ( ICF ) , isoniazid preventive therapy ( IPT ) infection control TB - target PLWHA.6 ICF IPT adequately implement part due absence sensitive , specific rapid TB test . The Cepheid GeneXpert System , new diagnostic test TB , self-contained sputum-processing real-time PCR system detect M. tuberculosis complex well rifampin resistance.78 The GeneXpert rapid , highly sensitive specific , use point-of-care test , low human resource , laboratory infection control requirements.7 , 8 The WHO Strategic Advisory Group TB endorse recommendation widespread use GeneXpert.9 WHO strongly recommend GeneXpert use initial diagnostic test HIV-infected TB suspect multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) suspects.9 WHO also recommend implementation GeneXpert phase within context comprehensive national MDR-TB strategic plans.9 WHO recognize several operational condition need meet successful implementation , include limited stable electrical supply , security theft , trained personnel annual calibration instrument commercial supplier.9 WHO also note important document impact cost-effectiveness GeneXpert TB case detection.9 Trial Concept The overall objective proposal conduct cluster-randomized trial relative impact cost-effectiveness routine TB screening algorithm -- symptom screen point-of-care LED fluorescence sputum smear microscopy - versus GeneXpert-based TB screening algorithm - symptom screen point-of-care GeneXpert test - reduce morbidity mortality due TB among HIV-infected Malawians . 12 public sector clinic southern Malawi randomize 1 2 algorithm TB case detection part ICF exclusion TB prior IPT antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) initiation . In clinic assign GeneXpert algorithm , newly diagnose HIV-infected patient screen symptom TB , symptomatic , provide sputum GeneXpert point-of-care TB test . Under routine screening algorithm , patient clinic screen symptom TB , symptomatic , provide sputum point-of-care LED fluorescence smear microscopy . The current standard care Malawi Africa symptom screen sputum smear microscopy use Ziehl-Neelsen stain ( LED fluorescence microscopy ) alone . There sufficient evidence time demonstrate whether point-of-care LED microscopy versus GeneXpert test likely superior respect clinical impact and/or cost-effectiveness . Outcomes measured clinic level .</detailed_description>
