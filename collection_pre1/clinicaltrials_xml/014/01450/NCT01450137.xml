	<detailed_description>Background Giant-cell arteritis ( GCA ) immune-mediated disease mostly affect people old 50 year age . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) treatment dramatically alters symptoms course GCA , reduce likelihood vascular complication could lead e.g . blindness . However , relapse usually occur GC dosage taper , result frequent re-treatment high cumulative dosage GC time substantial toxicity morbidity ( e.g . diabetes mellitus , infection , enhance cardiovascular risk , osteoporotic fracture , cataract ) . Therefore , novel therapy need effectively reduce dose duration GC treatment provide durable remission GCA . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) humanize monoclonal antibody direct human interleukin-6 receptor ( IL-6R ) . Elevated tissue serum level IL-6 implicate giant cell arteritis . Inhibition IL-6 and/or receptor therefore represent new novel approach treatment RA . Objective The primary endpoint proportion patient achieve complete remission disease ( normal ESR CRP + absence sign symptom ) Week 12 GC dose 0.1 mg/kg/d prednisone . Methods 2-arm ( Tocilizumab + Glucocorticoids ( GCs ) v . Placebo + GCs ) , randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind , monocentric trial patient newly onset relapse giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) , satisfy ACR criterion AND elevate sedimentation rate 40 mm/h CRP &gt; 20 mg/L AND biopsy proven GCA OR large vessel vasculitis assess MR Angiography ( MRA ) .</detailed_description>
