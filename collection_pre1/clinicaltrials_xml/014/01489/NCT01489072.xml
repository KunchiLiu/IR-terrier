	<brief_summary>This study design compare effect two bolus dos intravenous remifentanil give prior emergence anesthesia : - incidence perioperative cough - time need emergence desflurane-based anesthesia - incidence sore throat extubation . The investigator hypothesis use high remifentanil bolus dose ( 0.5 mcg/kg ) give prior emergence desflurane-based anesthesia reduce incidence perioperative coughing compare low dose remifentanil ( 0.25 mcg/kg ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Two Bolus Doses Remifentanil Incidence Coughing During Emergence Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence important period general anesthesia several problem occur . Coughing , hypertension , tachycardia agitation observe emergence general anesthesia . Most patient cough emergence . Different technique drug study reduce cough emergence . There evidence support administration intravenous opioids prior emergence general anesthesia reduce perioperative coughing , agitation haemodynamic stimulation . However , depend type opioids give , may delay emergence anesthesia . The effect remifentanil infusion give combination isoflurane volatile agent show reduce incidence perioperative coughing without delay emergence anesthesia . The effect small bolus remifentanil give prior emergence prevent perioperative coughing yet study . Desflurane newer volatile agent allow early recovery anesthesia . This agent lead early discharge rapid resumption normal activity surgery . However , incidence cough around 70 % report desflurane-based anesthesia . This study compare effect two bolus dos remifentanil ( 0.25 mcg/kg 0.5 mcg/kg ) give prior emergence prevent perioperative cough desflurane-based anesthesia .</detailed_description>
