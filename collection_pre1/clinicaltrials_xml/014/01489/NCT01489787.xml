	<brief_title>Study Evaluate High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Procedure Patient With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification interest study : Colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) major public health issue ( 16 000 death year France ) . To date , complete resection CLM offer potential curative approach . However , minority patient ( 10 20 % ) candidate . 5-year survival rate liver resection range 20 35 % . Consequently , alternative locally target therapy ( radiofrequency , cryotherapy , laser , microwave ) develop evaluate . Their use present many limitation : invasive procedure require intraparenchymal introduction probe , impossibility accurate monitoring real-time , small size destruction , time-consuming , high recurrence rate . The development non-invasive accurate technique combine surgery require . High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) new approach , enable generate irreversible cell death coagulative necrosis second . There 's cool effect perfusion shortness phenomenon . The surgical team Centre Leon Berard , collaboration INSERM U556 one , undertaken research program CLM treatment HIFU . A new powerful device , without previously name limitation , develop . Preclinical study reveal interest , feasibility safety process . These result enable consider precede program early clinical study . Experimental design : Prospective , monocentric phase I/II study evaluate surgical medical device ( SMD ) . HIFU SMD evaluate clinical condition , patient undergo hepatectomy colorectal liver metastasis . Several HIFU `` shooting '' ( number function advancement study ) perform liver witch resect Objectives main assessment criterion : 1. st part : Phase I - healthy liver remove . Feasibility 1 , Safety 2 , Tolerance 3 . Success = 1 Ability perform shooting , supplementary duration intervention &lt; 30 minute ; 2 Asepsis , absence lesion nearly tissue ; 3 Preservation hemodynamic respiratory constant . 2. nd part : Phase IIa - healthy liver remove , distant close vascular structure liver . Ability target shooting . Success = distance epicentre HIFU lesion mark previously position liver ≤ 5mm . 3. rd part : Phase IIb - metastasis remove . Ability , summation HIFU lesion , generate `` macro-lesions `` include metastasis insuring sufficient safety margin healthy tissue . Success = macro-lesion generate negative margin . Number patient : 1. st part : The inclusion 2 6 patient require . The next step ( phase II ) depend : - 1st analysis 2 patient : - If &lt; 2 failure : continuation , - If 2 failure : cessation study . - 2nd analysis 6 patient : - If &lt; 3 failure : continuation ( phase II ) , - If ≥ 3 failure : cessation . 2. nd part : Three patient successively include 2 landing ( appendix 1 ) : - If failure : continuation ( 2nd land / Phase IIb ) , - If ≤ 2 failure : + 3 patient , - If &gt; 2 failure 6 patient : cessation , - If ≤ 2 failure 6 patient : continuation ( 2nd land / phase IIb ) , - If 3 failure : cessation . 3. rd part : - p0 = 0.70 = upper limit success rate result inefficacy HIFU multi-shootings . - p1 = 0.90 = low limit success rate result efficacy HIFU shooting . With 5 % risk type I error 80 % power , 28 metastasis target HIFU order conclude one-sided situation . Taking account average 1.5 metastasis target patient , 20 patient enrol . 24 observed success allow conclude reject H0 accept H1 .</detailed_description>
