	<brief_summary>Few area controversial pediatric nutrition role vegetarian diet child . Advocates make strong health claim whereas others express safety concern , especially regard iron nutrition . The frequency vegetarianism among child say rapidly increase although clear data available . Surveys child US age 8 18 report medium find 3-5 % child lacto-ovo vegetarian , fish chicken product diet . This substantial proportion likely increase next year essentially nutrient metabolism data related population . One principal concern lacto-ovo vegetarian diet , prefer many child , lack heme iron diet . A key question evaluate child whether iron status fact affect lacto-ovo vegetarian diet . According American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP Pediatric Nutrition Handbook , 6th Edition , 2008 ) , vegetarian diet provide appropriate nutrition child . Depending level dietary restriction , fortify food supplement may necessary different life stage . In addition , strict vegetarian child may slightly high protein need compare non-vegetarian child due decrease protein digestibility certain plant . The AAP recommend child 4-8 year old consume minimum five serving per day beans/nuts/seeds/eggs six serving per day calcium-rich food . To evaluate issue , investigator use stable isotope method directly assess iron status . It increasingly recognize ability absorb iron give vitamin C highly accurate measurement iron status may true gold standard regard . In planned study , investigator able assess reference dose iron absorption standard biochemical marker iron status group lacto-ovo vegetarian compare age- gender-matched child non-vegetarian diet . These data important determine iron status decrease lacto-ovo vegetarian serve basis future intervention evaluation difference find .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron absorption study do 30 healthy vegetarian child 4 10 yr age 30 healthy non-vegetarian child age gender match control ( another study ) . Visit 1 : At time enrollment , subject family ask come General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Texas Children 's Hospital Metabolic Research Unit ( MRU ) Children 's Nutrition Research Center screen visit . Prior visit , demographic parent/guardian record include child 's approximate height weight , study dietitian obtain two 24-hour dietary recall parent determine dietary intake enrollment . During screen visit , inform write consent obtain anthropometry vital sign record . The study dietitian instruct parent/guardian child use food scale weigh record dietary intake 3-day period ( ie , 3-day weigh diet record ) . The 3-day weighed diet record begin follow day . Upon analysis child 's intake , parent instruct maintain similar nutrient intake throughout study . Compliance monitor via 3-day weigh home diet record time study visit . If analysis show child 's intake significantly change ( Â± 20 % nutrient ) , parent counsel study dietitian readjust child 's intake back usual level determine baseline . Visit 2 : Subjects admit GCRC MRU outpatient 2-3h fast give reference dose 1mg iron-58 sulfate aqueous solution 50mg ascorbic acid . They observe 2h dose water freely available . No food allow however water allow . After 2h subject discharge home food allow . After discharge , subject record dietary intake use another 3-day weighed diet record . Visit 3 : Prior visit , subject receive food scale perform another 3-day weighed diet record demonstrate consistency diet throughout study period . Two week ( +/- 3 day ) later subject readmitted 10mL blood ( 2 tsp ) drawn measurement iron nutritional parameter ( e.g . hepcidin , ferritin , iron , TIBC , transferrin saturation , hemoglobin , hematocrit , RBC index ) iron isotope ratio measurement . Labs iron nutritional parameter may send TCH Lab outside commercial lab . Incorporation iron-58 use measure absorption reference dose ( measure iron status ) . Topical numb cream spray minimize pain injection site offer subject .</detailed_description>
