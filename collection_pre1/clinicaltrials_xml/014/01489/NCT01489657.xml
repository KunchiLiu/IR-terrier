	<brief_title>The Metabolite Profiling Obese Subjects Before After Sleeve Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present study examine metabolic fluctuation important amino acid fatty acid well understand metabolic process weight reduction obese subject underwent sleeve gastrectomy surgery . The availability tandem equipment amino acid fatty acid determination medical system give u opportunity investigate metabolic turmoil weight reduction see obese subject sleeve gastrectomy . We evaluate lipid metabolism measurement fraction carnitine fatty acid available one small blood specimen finger puncture need . In present study measure blood concentration monocarboxylic dicarboxylic fatty acid bound carnitine , free carnitine also free amino acid 2 week surgery subject eat regular high caloric diet , one week , one month 3 month procedure . Carnitne fatty acid comprise tip iceberg circulate fatty acid blood roughly distribution : triglyceride , phospholipid cholesteryl fatty acid 4 ( Lipids43-65 ) , free fatty acid 0.6 , carnitne fatty acid 0.005 mM . Some additional amount also circulate lipoprotein . Even carnitine monocarboxylic fatty acid comprise around 1 % free fatty acid around 0.1 % fatty compound , fluctuation concentration probably reflect dynamic metabolic event fatty acid oxidation must initiate bind fatty acid carnitine . The concentration dicarboxylic carnitine fatty acids much high comprise 2 % malic carnitine 10 % glutaric carnitine total amount free acid ( http : //www.hmdb.ca/ ) . Yet , monocarboxylic fatty acid , remarkable mass dicarboxylic acid still present free acid . For carnitne acyl compound distribution form high variability different physiological condition .</detailed_description>
