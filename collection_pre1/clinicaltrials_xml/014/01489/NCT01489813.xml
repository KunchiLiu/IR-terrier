	<brief_summary>Patients non-invasive bladder cancer often treat intravesical therapy order prevent recurrence bladder cancer . Intravesical therapy cause many low urinary tract symptom , limit dose therapy therefore efficacy treatment . There number study suggest chemical find soy bean may able help side effect . This chemical call genistein extract give study subject pill form . In study , investigator would like patient place two different group . One group would take genistein group would take placebo , sugar pill look like genistein pill . In study investigator hope explore finding study see low urinary tract symptom reduce see recurrence rate patient affect genistein . The study would take four half month total .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Genistein Reducing Side Effects Superficial Bladder Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) intravesical therapy non-muscle invasive ( TaT1 ) Tis superficial bladder cancer often develop adverse effect ( urinary tract symptom ) limit dose ( therefore efficacy ) therapy result poor quality life . Genistein nutritional supplement anti-inflammatory property might help alleviate adverse effect intravesical therapy due inflammation . Additionally , genistein also anti-tumor immunopotentiating property show known side effect . Our hypothesis genistein give together BCG intravesical therapy reduce adverse effect improve efficacy therapy . Patients ( N=88 ) schedule intravesical therapy randomly assign take 30 mg tablet PO TID genistein ( N=44 ) placebo ( N=44 ) therapy one month post therapy .</detailed_description>
