	<brief_summary>This proof concept study determine safety allergenicity hypoallergenic peanut product extract compare standard peanut extract adult population know peanut allergy . This assess epicutaneous skin prick test . The hypothesis subject previously diagnose peanut allergy less epicutaneous reaction hypoallergenic peanut product extract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Allergenicity Hypoallergenic Peanut Product Peanut Allergic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergic volunteer identify positive skin prick test peanut ( peanut extract obtain Greer laboratory ) . The peanut extract use FDA approve routinely use confirm diagnosis peanut allergy . Serum Total IgE peanut-specific IgE measure assessment atopy general confirmation Peanut allergy respectively . Only patient positive skin test peanut enrol study . Allergic volunteer ask abstain take antihistamine ( H1 H2 ) 3 day prior skin test . Testing day 1 . Obtain informed consent 2 . Obtain medical history , list current medication 3 . Vital sign . 4 . Obtain urine pregnancy test applicable 5 . Perform partial physical exam ( PE ) include , ENT , Eyes , Neck , Respiratory , Cardiac Skin focus mainly lungs rule bronchospasm/asthma exacerbation . 6 . Epicutaneous skin prick test histamine saline control , standard peanut extract do subject ( Total skin prick=3 ) . Those subject qualify study ( test positive standard peanut extract ) undergo skin prick test standard histamine control , standard saline control , hypoallergenic ( Trypsin+Chymotrypsin treat ) extract , extract blanch untreated ( enzyme ) peanut , non-blanched untreated extract , peanut treat 0.2 % inactivated a-chymotrypsin trypsin enzyme control . A second set skin test reagent may use reagent treat alcalase . Skin test read 15 minute . A positive test define â‰¥ 3mm wheal compare saline control . DermaPIK device use skin prick testing . 7 . Obtain blood sample One time 20ml collection determination total IgE , peanut specific IgE peanut allergic individual . Physical Exams perform study physician . Procedures skin testing , vital sign , venipuncture , do study coordinator , qualify nurse technical staff . Clinical lab ( Serum IgE Peanut-specific IgE ) process Labcorp Inc Burlington , NC . Recording Skin Test result : Skin test reaction trace onto clear cellophane tape measurement obtain . This tape affix subject 's visit record personal medical record . Excess sample remain completion analysis study store CEMALB Repository ( IRB # 05-2528 ) participant ask sign Repository consent form . Failure consent repository result exclusion main study .</detailed_description>
