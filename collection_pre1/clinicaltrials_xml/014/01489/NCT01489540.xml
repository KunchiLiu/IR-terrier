	<brief_summary>Accurate early burn depth assessment important determine optimal treatment . The applied method ass burn depth clinical assessment . This method least expensive , accurate . Laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) show accurately assess burn depth . The clinical effect , cost cost-effectiveness device however , unknown . The hypothesis eary accurate diagnosis lead earlier therapeutic decision : surgery surgery . Earlier excision graft probably lead decrease wound heal time , length hospital stay cost . Before investigator decide implement LDI Dutch burn care study clinical effect cost-effectiveness LDI necessary . Therefore multicenter randomize control trial conduct , include patient burns indeterminate depth ( burn obviously superficial full thickness ) treat Dutch burn centre . In total 200 patient include 18 month period . The patient randomly divide two group : 'new diagnostic strategy ' versus 'current diagnostic strategy ' . Burn depth diagnose clinical assessment laser Doppler imaging patient . The result LDI-scan provide treat clinician 'new diagnostic strategy ' group . Time wound heal , diagnostic therapeutic decision , cost observe .</brief_summary>
