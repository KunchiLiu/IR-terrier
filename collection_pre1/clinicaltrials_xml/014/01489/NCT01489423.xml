	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue blood laboratory patient treat ipilimumab without sargramostim may help doctor learn effect ipilimumab sargramostim cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research trial study tissue blood biomarkers patient stage III melanoma stage IV melanoma treat ipilimumab without sargramostim .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare pathology primary melanoma , melanoma metastasis , post-treatment melanoma metastasis relation clinical outcome patient receive ipilimumab plus sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient receive ipilimumab alone . - To determine effect addition systemic GM-CSF ipilimumab effector immune function patient metastatic melanoma . - To determine effect addition systemic GM-CSF ipilimumab regulatory immune function patient metastatic melanoma . - To determine effect addition systemic GM-CSF ipilimumab anti-tumor humoral immunity patient metastatic melanoma . OUTLINE : Serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell , tumor tissue ( primary tumor post-treatment biopsy ) sample analyze biomarkers predictive clinical outcome , immune function , anti-tumor humoral immunity IHC , RT-PCR , flow cytometry , ELISPOT assay , ELISA .</detailed_description>
