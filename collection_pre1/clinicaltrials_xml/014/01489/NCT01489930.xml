	<brief_summary>Loss skeletal muscle strength skeletal muscle mass occur age . This are-related decline skeletal muscle mass skeletal muscle strength major underlying factor contribute many metabolic disorder frailty investigator rapidly expand age population . Endurance ( aerobic ) resistance exercise training program show effectively reverse age-related decline metabolic contractile muscle function . The investigator measure synthesis rate individual muscle proteins 36 young ( 18-30 yr ) 36 old ( &gt; 65 yr ) people determine response 8 week endurance , resistance , combine endurance resistance training , placebo exercise training . Hypotheses . 1. measure fractional synthesis rate multiple muscle protein identify enhance endurance exercise program 2. determine whether change protein synthesis response endurance exercise program dependent age 3. measure fractional muscle synthesis rate multiple muscle protein identify enhance resistance exercise program 4. determine whether change protein synthesis response resistance exercise program dependent age</brief_summary>
