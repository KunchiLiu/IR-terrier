	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction inflammatory reaction , turn delay heal endothelialization may lead restenosis atherosclerosis within stented segment . Drugs polymer consider protagonist pathophysiologic process whereas role stent platform remain poorly define . Due advance stent technology , stent platform evolve cobalt-chromium ( CoCr ) platinum-chromium ( PtCr ) stent series . At present , PROMUS Element stent ( use PtCr platform ) employ identical polymer , drug , drug formulation dose density CoCr XIENCE V stent . The PLATINUM WH trial randomize trial compare PROMUS Element stent XIENCE V stent total 1,530 patient . The study meet primary end-point demonstrating PROMUS Element stent non-inferior XIENCE V stent . The 12-month rare target lesion failure 3.4 % PROMUS Element stent 2.9 % XIENCE V stent . Pre-clinical animal study , however , suggest PtCr platform might important advantage CrCo platform , improve vascular compatibility early late heal PtCr device compare CoCr stent demonstrate . In rabbit denudation model , show 14 day luminal surface area incompletely endothelialised CrCo stent nearly complete PtCr stent . Similarly , another experimental study show overall strut coverage , include endothelial cell coverage plus non-endothelial cell coverage ( focal platelet fibrin aggregate inter-mixed red blood cell inflammatory cell ) , significantly low 14 day CoCr stent PtCr OMEGA stent . Additionally , recent investigation show thinner-strut PtCr stent associate reduce fibrin deposition rapid fibrin clearance porcine coronary artery compare CrCo stent , thus suggest PtCr stent platform may induce less injury compare previous-generation platform . The primary objective study perform randomize comparison biohumoral effect platinum chromium everolimus-eluting stent ( PtCr EES ) vs. cobalt chromium everolimus-eluting stent ( CoCr EES ) , i.e . stent different platform identical drug polymer .</detailed_description>
