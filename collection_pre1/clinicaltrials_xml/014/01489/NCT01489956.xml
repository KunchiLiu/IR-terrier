	<brief_title>A Study Determine Immunogenicity Oral Tolerance Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( KLH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One type normal immune response call `` oral tolerance . '' This immune system ( body 's natural defense system illness ) turn ( e.g . respond ) food proteins eaten . Oral tolerance test do feed people protein vaccinate protein . Oral tolerance occur vaccination cause immune response . In study , oral tolerance Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( KLH ) test . KLH large protein extract mollusk ( sea animal ) . The 'native KLH ' ( large version protein ) formulation use oral feeding . Immucothel ( small version KLH protein ) use vaccination ( injection ) . Immucothel investigational vaccine currently use treat bladder cancer outside US . Since particular KLH product never use oral tolerance study , investigator want make sure pilot study work expect healthy participant study two product patient auto-immune disorder . This study also determine Immucothel strong enough trigger immune response . If , Immucothel test combination adjuvant ( substance increase immune response protein like KLH ) determine adequate immune response see . This study consist two part . Participants participate either 39 day ( Part A ) 65 day ( Part B ) . Regardless group assignment , safety follow-up phone call occur 6 month last immunization ( 189 day Part A 215 day part B ) ass late onset adverse event . Part A study test experimental vaccine Immucothel combination adjuvant . Immucothel purify protein mollusk . Immucothel give sub-q injection ( skin ) alone adjuvant ( small amount mineral oil ) help enhance immune response . There maybe two group part : 1 . Ten evaluable ( define protocol ) participant give Immucothel alone injection two occasion , If Immucothel alone create immune response participant Part A complete . 2 . If Immucothel alone create immune response participant Part A , 10 new evaluable ( define protocol ) participant ask volunteer test Immucothel combination adjuvant Montanide ( mineral oil ) . This give injection two occasion If immune response participant combination Immucothel Montanide Part A do . Part B study test successful Immucothel regimen Part A oral KLH . Ten new evaluable ( define protocol ) participant give experimental oral KLH .</detailed_description>
