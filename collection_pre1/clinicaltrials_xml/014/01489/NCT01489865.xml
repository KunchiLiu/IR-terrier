	<brief_summary>People ask participate study metastatic pancreatic cancer ( cancer spread part body ) . The purpose study test efficacy ( effectiveness ) new combination drug , ABT-888 mFOLFOX-6 ( modify 5-Fluorouracil Oxaliplatin ) patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . ABT-888 inhibits enzyme call `` PARP '' help fix damage DNA . By inhibit enzyme , ABT-888 prevents cancer cell repair damage cause mFOLFOX-6 , hopefully increase kill cancer cell , thus decrease tumor body .</brief_summary>
