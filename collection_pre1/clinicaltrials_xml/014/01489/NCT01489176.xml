	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effective Regadenoson detect coronary artery disease stress echocardiogram Optison administer . Optison contrast agent improve image heart echocardiogram ( echo ) machine . Optison approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use stress echocardiogram . Regadenoson commercially available rapid act stress agent use chemically increase heart rate approve nuclear imaging test . Regadenoson FDA approve drug intend use study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stress perfusion image primarily do radionuclide scintigraphy single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) reach full clinical potential poor spatial resolution SPECT , increase expense procedure , patient exposure ionize radiation , lack availability . The A2A receptor agonist Regadenoson utilize detect myocardial perfusion abnormality SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging . A 100 patient pilot study ( Regadenoson Real Time Perfusion Imaging Trial , IRB # 566-08-FB ) demonstrate feasibility accuracy real-time perfusion echocardiography ( RTPE ) detect coronary artery disease follow Regadenoson bolus injection Definity ultrasound contrast agent . The aim study determine whether similar feasibility accuracy achieve Optison ( Food Drug Administration approve ultrasound contrast agent differs slightly microbubble size composition ) detect coronary artery disease ( CAD ) follow Regadenoson bolus injection . As original study , sensitivity , specificity , accuracy perfusion wall motion analysis identify coronary stenosis &gt; 50 % diameter quantitative angiography analyze .</detailed_description>
