	<brief_summary>For patient Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -mediated food allergy , current management include identification causative food avoidance . Egg allergy among common cause IgE-mediated food allergy child , affect approximately 1.6 % child ( prevalence high child atopic dermatitis food allergy ) . Given prevalence egg difficulty avoid diet , aim investigate safety efficacy bake egg oral immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Egg Oral Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study efficacy bake egg oral immunotherapy . The secondary objective determine safety allergen-specific immunotherapy egg allergy ingestion bake egg product whether ultimately lead desensitize state native egg . We also examine quality life improve expansion diet . Subjects age six 17 year history egg protein allergy recruit The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) Allergy practice ( main campus satellite location ) . Prior desensitization bake egg , conduct double blind placebo-controlled food challenge native egg protein . During desensitization phase , give increase dos bake egg ( meringue cookie equivalent ) weekly basis , tolerate . The primary endpoint study include percentage subject successfully complete food challenge native egg complete desensitization protocol bake egg . Secondary outcome measure include egg-specific IgE , quality life desensitization , egg skin prick test size .</detailed_description>
