	<brief_summary>The primary objective protocol determine visual acuity outcomes 2 year eyes proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) receive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) therapy defer panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) non-inferior eye receive standard prompt PRP therapy . Secondary objective include : - Comparing visual function outcome ( include Humphrey visual field test study participant self-reports visual function ) eye receive anti-VEGF deferred PRP eye receive prompt PRP . - Determining percent eye require PRP anti-VEGF give absence prompt PRP . - Comparing safety outcome treatment group . - Comparing associate treatment follow-up exam cost treatment group .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; = 18 year Individuals &lt; 18 year old include proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) rare age group diagnosis PDR may questionable . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) and/or World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion ( see Procedures Manual definition ) Able willing provide inform consent . Meets least follow ocular criterion criterion : Presence PDR investigator intend manage PRP alone PRP defer least 4 week set intravitreal ranibizumab , investigator 's judgment . Best correct ElectronicEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( EETDRS ) visual acuity letter score &gt; 24 ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/320 ) day randomization . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , study participant cooperation sufficient administer PRP obtain adequate fundus photograph optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Investigator must verify accuracy OCT scan ensuring center adequate quality Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Individuals poor glycemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication study . Study participant receive another investigational drug participate study . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , individual become eligible . Myocardial infarction , acute cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization . These drug use study . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 3 year . Women potential study participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . Individual expect move area clinical center area cover another Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) certify clinical center 3 year study . Individual follow ocular characteristic : History prior panretinal photocoagulation ( prior PRP define â‰¥ 100 burn outside posterior pole ) Tractional retinal detachment involve macula . A tractional retinal detachment exclusion outside posterior pole ( threaten macula ) investigator 's judgment , contraindication intravitreal ranibizumab treatment also preclude defer PRP least 4 week set intravitreal ranibizumab Exam evidence neovascularization angle ( neovascularization iris alone exclusion preclude defer PRP least 4 week investigator 's judgment ) . If macular edema present , consider primarily due cause diabetic macular edema . An eye consider eligible : macular edema present consider related ocular surgery cataract extraction clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface abnormality disease ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . An ocular condition present ( diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion investigator , might alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , retinal vein artery occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . A vitreous preretinal hemorrhage exclusion visual axis investigator 's judgment affect visual acuity . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . History intravitreal antiVEGF treatment time past 2 month . History corticosteroid treatment ( intravitreal peribulbar ) time past 4 month . If investigator believe may still substantial effect 4 month prior treatment ( e.g. , dose intravitreal triamcinolone high 4 mg ) , eye include . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 4 month anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization . History ( yttriumaluminumgarnet ) YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization . Aphakia . Uncontrolled glaucoma ( investigator 's judgment ) . Exam evidence severe external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , substantial blepharitis</criteria>
