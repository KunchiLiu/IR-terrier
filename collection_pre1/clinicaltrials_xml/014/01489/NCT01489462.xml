	<detailed_description>Muscle loss fat gain contribute disability , pain , morbidity associate knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , thigh muscle weakness independent modifiable risk factor . However , publish treatment guideline , support Level-1 evidence , recommend muscle strengthen combat sarcopenia improve muscle quality knee OA patient , previous strength-training study either used intensity load recommended level generally short , last 6 24 week . Consequently , low-to-modest effect size , could detect change disease progression , address underlie OA mechanism , provide little lasting clinical benefit . The positive effect long-term , structured exercise know persist even year supervise treatment terminates . The efficacy high intensity strength train improve OA symptom , slow progression , affect underlying mechanism examine due unsubstantiated belief might exacerbate symptom . Our preliminary data clearly show excellent tolerance high-intensity strength training well reduce pain increased function among old adult knee OA . Similar study healthy old adult find improvement thigh muscle mass decrease thigh fat mass minimal alteration total body weight 16-18 week train . We propose 18-month , high-intensity strength-training intervention old adult knee OA , focus improve thigh composition ( muscle less fat ) . We hypothesize addition short-term clinical benefit , combine great duration high intensity alter thigh composition sufficiently attain long-term change knee-joint force , decrease inflammatory cytokine , low pain level , slow OA progression , yet convincingly demonstrated OA treatment . These important benefit achievable short intervention . Participants randomize one 3 group : high-intensity strength training ; low-intensity strength training ; attention control . The primary clinical aim compare intervention ' effect knee pain , primary mechanistic aim compare effect knee-joint compressive force walk , mechanism affect OA disease pathway . Secondary aim compare intervention effect additional clinical measure disease severity ( e.g. , function , mobility ) ; disease progression , measure xray ; thigh muscle fat volume , measure CT ; component thigh muscle function , include hip abductor strength quadriceps strength , power , proprioception ; additional measure knee-joint loading ; inflammatory OA biomarkers .</detailed_description>
