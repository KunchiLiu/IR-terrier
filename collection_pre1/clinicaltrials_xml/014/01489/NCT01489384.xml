	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis chronic systemic inflammatory disease associate significant morbidity mortality . The disease characterize inflammation synovial joint result pain , swell joint damage secondary deformity progressive disability impairment patient 's health relate quality life . It estimate 1 % population worldwide RA . Treatment RA include use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) selective inhibitor , corticosteroid DMARDs . The effectiveness toxicity associate use DMARDs differs base individual agent ; DMARDs often partially effective . For DMARDs fully treat RA , TNF inhibitor often prescribe . TNFα play important role RA . Activities ascribe TNFα RA include recruitment activation polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , cellular proliferation , increase prostaglandin matrix-degrading protease activity , bone cartilage resorption . CIMZIA ( certolizumab pegol ) combination methotrexate ( MTX ) indicate : • reduce sign symptom , induce major clinical response , reduce progression joint damage assess X-ray , adult patient moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .</detailed_description>
