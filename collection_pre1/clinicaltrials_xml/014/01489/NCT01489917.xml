	<brief_title>A-priori Versus Provisional Heparin Radial Artery Occlusion After Transradial Coronary Angiography Patent Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transradial access use coronary angiography intervention increase . Its efficacy lower access site complication , well increased patient comfort , proven unequivocally . One complication transradial access radial artery occlusion ( RAO ) occur variable incidence . It population specific , high prevalence subset , woman , patient 's small radial artery . RAO also know high hospital discharge radial recanalization may spontaneously occur later time . It usually asymptomatic . Its main adverse impact limit future transradial access radial artery . Since patient 's atherosclerotic vascular disease may undergo several invasive procedure lifetime , prevention RAO paramount importance . Heparinization , procedure , show benefit lower incidence RAO . Maintaining patency radial artery hemostasis , also show effective prevention RAO follow transradial access . As maintenance flow potent antithrombotic effect , unclear whether systemic anticoagulation still require case . In case , would preferable avoid heparin administration prior coronary angiography . It currently unknown whether would safe refrain heparin administration case transradial catheterization patent hemostasis technique .</detailed_description>
