	<brief_summary>This clinical study scientific study patient limbal stem cell . In clinical study tissue take inside mouth , cell tissue ( epithelial cell ) grow form multilayered cell-sheet , call CAOMECS , transplant onto cornea . This transplantation method repair damage cornea . The aim study see transplantation CAOMECS renew surface eye , prevent growth conjunctiva cornea stop new small blood vessel form .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study CAOMECS Transplantation Patients With Total Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open clinical study without control group , mean patient give study treatment ( CAOMECS ) . Adults well minor patient participate clinical trial . CAOMECS undergo clinical trial , mean yet officially approve treatment disease . Up clinically test France , 26 people limbal stem cell loss . Study objective The objective study restore ocular surface epithelium patient total LSCD prevent reduce recurrent conjunctivalization neovascularization 12 month post-transplantation . Methodology This prospective , open , multi-center study CAOMECS patient total LSCD . Stem cell isolated oral mucosa biopsy grow cell culture . The resultant epithelial cell-sheets transplant ocular surface respective patient general anesthesia . After transplantation patient may hospitalize accord routine clinical practice . Overall , study consist screen visit eligibility evaluate , day biopsy , day transplantation baseline data evaluate , transplantation ( day 0 ) , follow-up period consist nine visit day 1 , 5 , 10 month 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 . Other visit clinically indicate may also occur .</detailed_description>
