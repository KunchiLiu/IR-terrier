	<brief_summary>Background : - Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) transmit mosquito . It cause fever , headache , muscle pain , fatigue , joint pain . The disease usually cause death . But joint pain , may directly relate infect virus , may severe last several month . CHIKV outbreaks common Africa , India , Asia . A new experimental vaccine CHIKV develop , researcher test healthy adult . Participants develop CHIKV vaccine . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness Chikungunya virus vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 50 year age . Design : - This study , include vaccine dos followup test , last 44 week . Participants three vaccination visit , six followup clinic visit , three telephone contact study . Vaccination visit take 4 hour . Most clinic visit usually take 2 hour . The telephone contact take 15 minute . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample also collect . - Participants assign one three dose group . Information dose provide start vaccination . - Vaccine injection give start study , 4 week , 20 week . Participants ask keep eye injection site 7 day notify researcher side effect . - Participants monitor throughout study blood sample clinic visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study examine safety , tolerability , immune response Virus-Like Particle ( VLP ) Chikungunya Virus ( CHIKV ) vaccine healthy adult age 18 50 year old . The plan 25 subject receive 3 intramuscular vaccine injection week 0 , 4 , 20 . The three group enrol sequentially start low dose 10 microgram per injection Group 1 . The hypothesis vaccine safe induces immune response CHIKV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine , VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP , three dosage , 10 microgram ( mcg ) , 20 mcg , 40 mcg , healthy adult . The secondary objective evaluate antibody response CHIKV VLPs four week third vaccine injection . The exploratory objective relate antigen-specific humoral cellular immune response throughout study .</detailed_description>
