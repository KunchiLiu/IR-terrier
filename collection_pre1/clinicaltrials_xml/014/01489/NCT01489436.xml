	<brief_summary>New minimally invasive surgical treatment often outpatient procedure low complication rate , promise fast recovery . The traditional physician-reported outcome complication rate , blood loss , hospital stay useful guide treatment recommendation one minimally invasive procedure . This study aim apply patient-reported outcome develop within NIH framework cancer research chronic disease treatment comparative effectiveness research minimally invasive procedure benign disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Single Port Four Port Laparoscopic Gallbladder Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish pathway comparative effectiveness use patient report outcome minimally invasive surgery , propose use readily available easily reproducible model : cholecystectomy . Each year United States , approximately 750,000 patient undergo cholecystectomy . Patients clearly prefer laparoscopic approach open procedure abdominal surgery . Initial survey data suggest patient may also prefer even less invasive approach . Currently , standard operative procedure patient symptomatic gallstone disease laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform general anesthesia four small abdominal incision . Although postoperative pain cardiopulmonary wound complication much less compare open cholecystectomy , considerable cost generate lose productivity day work surgical procedure relate part pain physiologic response stress operative procedure . Anecdotal data suggest few incision , especially few transabdominal incision , translate less pain , less need narcotic pain medication faster recovery , randomize trial data need . We propose compare effectiveness novel single-port cholecystectomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy , current standard care .</detailed_description>
