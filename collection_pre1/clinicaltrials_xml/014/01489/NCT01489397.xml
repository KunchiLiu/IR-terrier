	<brief_summary>Magnified intelligence chromoendoscopy ( FICE ) plus probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia ( GIM ) diagnosis : feasibility trial Research Question : Is confocal endomicroscope feasible diagnose gastric intestinal metaplasia ? Objective : To evaluate feasibility confocal endomicroscope diagnose gastric intestinal metaplasia . Hypothesis : Confocal endomicreosocpe provide accurate diagnosis gastric intestinal metaplasia . Research design : Diagnostic study Sample size : The investigator follow population recent study Imraporn et al . : Validity magnify NBI gastric intestinal metaplasia target biopsy ( N= 50 ) Data analysis : Confocal Barrett 's esophagus classification use evaluate agreement confocal endomicroscopic find gastric intestinal metaplasia . The accuracy new criterion GIM confocal endomicroscope evaluate relation pathological report , gold standard diagnosis , report sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value accuracy criterion . Expected Benefit Application : The feasibility confocal endomicroscopy diagnosis gastric intestinal metaplasia order improve quality GIM/dysplasia/early gastric cancer detection decrease mortality rate gastric cancer future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnified Intelligence Chromoendoscopy Plus Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Gastric cancer second lead cause cancer relate death world recently data . The incidence mortality rate predominant East Asia . Usually , gastric cancer asymptomatic early stage ; therefore ; patient advance stage incurable diagnosis . The pathogenesis intestinal type gastric cancer sequential multistep pathway . Moreover , direction pathway irreversible beyond dysplasia . The equipment and/or procedure detect gastric dysplasia beneficial . The recent study , Imraporn B et al. , show narrow-banded imaging magnification ( NBI-ME ) good sensitivity gastric intestinal metaplasia ( GIM ) detection standard white light endoscopy ( 73 % VS. 13 % ) could detect two early gastric cancer tissue pathology 1-year follow-up cohort study . However , NBI-ME differentiate among GIM , dysplasia gastric cancer . Confocal endomicroscope powerful instrument perform high-resolution ( x1,000 time ) image enable real-time histology and/or optical biopsy time endoscopic examination ( vivo histology ) .Fluorescein , slightly acidic hydrophilic dye , use stain substance via IV administration . The fluorescein establish stable distribution throughout surface epithelial cell , regular columnar epithelium round gland opening cobblestone pattern ; connective tissue matrix lamina propria ; blood vessel , regular shape visible deep mucosa ; red blood cells.It highly miscible mucin , hence , mucins goblet cell , indicate GIM , appear dark . Because GIM characterize diminutive lesion microscopic abnormality amidst large field diffuse disease , biopsy target adequate sample difficult time consume . Therefore , instant resection confocal microendoscope possible . Consequently , patient must diagnose GIM via target NBI-ME biopsy first . And endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) via confocal endomicrosocpe possible complete therapeutic treatment early gastric cancer within session suspect area gastric dysplasia neoplasia . However , study confocal endomicroscope relate early detection gastric cancer observe . In study , must apply endomicroscope 's criterion confocal Barrett 's esophagus classification indicate gastric dysplasia neoplasia . The aim study evaluate feasibility confocal endomicroscopy diagnose gastric intestinal metaplasia . Review related literature : Confocal endomicroscope available 2005 . The difference white light endoscope confocal endomicroscope . Nowadays , point-scanning fiber-optic fluorescein confocal endomicroscope evaluate cellular morphology upper- lower-GI tract possible . However , improvement diagnostic yield evaluate Barrett 's esophagus , colorectal cancer , detect Helicobacter pylorus . There exactly study early detection gastric cancer confocal endomicroscope . Investigator use confocal Barrett 's esophagus classification predict area dysplasia neoplasia stomach . Assumption : All patient undergo target NBI-ME biopsy never treat gastric cancer . Key Words : Confocal endomicroscope Gastric intestinal metaplasia Operational definition : Gastric intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia/neoplasim base update Sydney classification . Research methodology : Population Sample Target sample population : The patient diagnose gastric intestinal metaplasia ( GIM ) past 2 year KCMH . Observation Measurement : Collect geographic data interview review outpatient record . Evaluate tissue pathology one pathologist Methodology : 1 . All patient inform consent . 2 . Take history , physical examination fill record form 3 . Set confocal endomicroscopy - 10 % Fluorescein sodium 10 ml inject intravenously . - 2.5-5 milligram intravenous midazolam 10 milligram hyoscine inject sedate decrease bowel movement easy complete visualization . - Simethicone solution rinse reduce mucous gas bubble stomach . - FICE use identify area suspect GIM . - Confocal endomicroscopy perform target suspected area . One snapshot image record area suspect record criterion diagnosis GIM . Endoscopic resection do suspected area . - DVD record endoscopy . 4 . Record duration complication procedure 5 . Send tissue one clinically-blinded GI pathologist 6 . Compare pathology report endoscopic find 7 . Report result Data collection : All data process recorded one physician . Ethical consideration : There clearly evidence serious side effect fluorescein injection . If patient side effect research , procedure terminate patient take care KCMH staff . Limitation : This novel diagnostic tool analyze live cell endoscopy , especially gastric intestinal metaplasia ( GIM ) . There standard criterion confocal endomicroscopy find GIM . Investigator apply Barrett 's esophagus criterion learn criterion GIM gastric cancer . Obstacles strategy solve problem : Because study base population previous study Imraporn et al. , maybe patient loss follow . The strategy solve problem 1 . Early call back make appointment 2 . Collect new patient database pathology department , KCMH</detailed_description>
