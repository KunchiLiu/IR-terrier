	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give EGEN-001 together pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . Biological therapy , EGEN-001 , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving EGEN-001 together pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGEN-001 Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) EGEN-001 administer combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ( PLD ; Doxil ; Lipodox ) every 28 day associate DLTs base adverse event occur cycle 1 combination woman recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . To examine tolerability combination MTD EGEN-001 assess combination PLD . III . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) EGEN-001 combination PLD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate ( complete partial ) patient measurable disease . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine level time course interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) follow EGEN-001 treatment . II . Assess effect EGEN-001 treatment nature cellular immune response measure cell-specific ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) transcript . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study EGEN-001 . Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 EGEN-001 intraperitoneally ( IP ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow quarterly 1 year .</detailed_description>
