	<brief_title>Evaluate Efficacy Sorafenib Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients After Radical Resection Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced RCC present poor prognosis , pathogenesis clearly understood . However , up-regulation Ras pathway think play role . VEGF expression could represent independent prognostic factor survival possibly link expression protein clinical outcome . Sorafenib potent inhibitor Raf-kinase VEGF R2 signal The anti-tumoral activity Sorafenib clearly demonstrate phase III trial regard advance pretreated RCC . Surgical removal metastatic disease could potentially increase disease control rate . Particularly patient disease free interval post nephrectomy least 1 year , one small metastatic lesion , metastasectomy could represent important therapeutic approach . After radical resection metastatic disease unclear anti-tumoral systemic therapy may increase patient survival . In summary , preclinical clinical data support evaluation Sorafenib RCC patient .</detailed_description>
