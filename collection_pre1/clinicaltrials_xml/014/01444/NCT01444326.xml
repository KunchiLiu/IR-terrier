	<brief_summary>Inflammation endothelial dysfunction increasingly recognize key etiological factor development atherosclerosis subsequent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . These pro-atherogenic state strongly correlate often find co-segregating among individual obesity metabolic syndrome . There increase evidence support use clinical practice novel marker atherosclerosis CVD risk . Recent data JUPITER study ( Justification Use Statins Primary Prevention : An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ) provide undisputable evidence treat patient elevate plasma CRP concentration , marker systemic subclinical inflammation , lead mark reduction risk CHD even patient highly desirable LDL-C level . There also accumulate evidence associate endothelial dysfunction , define incapacity artery vasodilate require , increase risk CVD . While study diet affect inflammation endothelial function , impact dairy consumption per se novel risk factor CVD well characterize . The purpose study investigate impact dairy consumption marker inflammation risk factor men woman low grade systemic inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Dairy Consumption Inflammation : Clinical Study ( PLI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research undertaken multicenter randomize cross-over control study . A total 140 men woman subclinical inflammation ( plasma CRP 2-10 mg/l ) otherwise healthy consume two diet , one rich dairy one without dairy , consume diet low saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % energy ) , trans fat ( &lt; 1 % energy ) cholesterol ( &lt; 200 mg/day ) . During DAIRY diet , subject ask incorporate 3 serving dairy ( milk , yogurt , cheese ) every day diet . During CONTROL arm study , participant ask consume energy equivalent replacement product . Each diet undertaken consecutively random order duration approximately 28 day ( 4 week ) .The primary analysis consist compare inflammation marker related risk factor two treatment . The study design detect 12-16 % difference plasma CRP concentration ( primary endpoint ) control dairy diet . A 2-week stabilization run-in period precede randomization participant . During run-in period , participant ask instructed adapt diet prudent dietary pattern low saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % energy ) , trans fat ( &lt; 1 % energy ) cholesterol ( &lt; 200 mg/day ) . The total amount fat diet restrict , recommendation range 25-35 % energy . However , substitution saturate unsaturated fat advocate . Sodium intake &lt; 2300 mg/d also recommend . Recommendations also include advice restrict consumption process energy dense food . The run-in diet include specific recommendation dairy product . Participants choice include/exclude dairy prudent diet , long comply main dietary recommendation . This 2-week run-in period allow participant familiarize dietary recommendation use intervention per se . The two diet separate 4-week wash period also consist prudent dietary pattern recommend . It must stress food provide run-in wash-out period . These period impose minimize inter- intra-individual variability experimental phase .</detailed_description>
