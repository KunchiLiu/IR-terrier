Since number patient diabetes mellitus number people smartphone rise , investigated whether application smartphones may use support lifestyle change self-monitoring bloodglucose control , possibly lead improve glycaemic regulation group patient diabetes mellitus . Large randomize control trial show stable glycaemic regulation important reduce morbidity mortality improve quality life ( QOL ) . Self-monitoring blood glucose important tool realize optimal glycaemic regulation patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . Apart good glycaemic control , QOL essential diabetic patient . A reduced QOL associate progression disease , bad intake medication increase mortality patient T1DM diabetes mellitus type 2 .
