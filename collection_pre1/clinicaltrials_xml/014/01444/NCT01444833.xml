	<brief_summary>It suppose significant metabolic effect ( improvement insulin sensitivity ) hypertension therapy renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) blocker human mediate mainly via change abdominal adipose tissue . This project aim confirm hypothesis increase concentration circulatory angiotensin II angiotensin II receptor type I ( AT1 ) blockade lead , via stimulation angiotensin II receptor type II ( AT2 ) , activation adipogenesis improvement insulin sensitivity . Therefore , hypertensive patient , component RAS parameter insulin sensitivity systemic ( plasma ) local ( adipose tissue interstitial fluid ) level study . The main aim study identify change occur patient 6 month conversion therapy angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor AT1 receptor blocker . Observed parameter include gene expression RAS component , parameter insulin sensitivity , amount , cellularity adipose tissue obtain biopsy , evaluation direct production cytokine angiotensins interstitial fluid fat tissue obtain microdialysis evaluation select parameter plasma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arterial hypertension nowadays consider metabolic disease , due occurrence together risk factor atherosclerosis like obesity , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , impair glucose regulation diabetes mellitus type 2 . These factor often result metabolic syndrome . Its pathogenetic mechanism completely clarify yet , polygenic inheritance environmental factor probably involve . Therefore , pathophysiological perspective hypertension therapy complex approach patient need . This approach require understand know risk factor lead pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention aim eliminate risk factor atherosclerosis . One main homeostatic system participate blood pressure regulation RAS . The present pharmacotherapy provide possibility influence RAS inhibition ) renin , b ) ACE c ) blockade AT1 receptor . 1 . Renin inhibitor belong recent therapeutic approach hypertension treatment . Clinical study , could enable use daily practice , complete yet . 2 . Inhibition angiotensin convert enzyme prevents transformation angiotensin I ( Ang I ) angiotensin II ( Ang II ) , prevent breakdown vasodilatatory kinin , mainly bradykinin , lead NO-mediated vasodilatation . The positive effect therapy ACE inhibitor base besides decrease circulate Ang II also decrease influence tissue Ang II , mainly vascular wall diminish norepinephrine release neural terminal autonomic nervous system ( Noshiro et al . 1991 ) . The ACE inhibitor reduce plasma Ang II level , thus AT1 AT2 receptor less stimulated hormone lead upregulation homologue ACE2 , thereby increase production angiotensin ( 1-7 ) ( Ferrario et al . 2005 ) . Angiotensin ( 1-7 ) bind AT1 well AT2 receptor tentative AT ( 1-7 ) receptor . Some ACE inhibitor positive effect improvement glucose metabolism . The mechanism improvement insulin sensitivity completely explain yet . It suppose , positive insulin-sensitizing effect ACE inhibitor could mediate hemodynamic change - improvement skeletal muscle blood flow and/or stimulation insulin signal pathway increase expression number glucose transporter GLUT4 . The improvement insulin sensitivity therapy ACE inhibitor correlate change ion calcium/magnesium balance . The sympatholytic effect therapy RAS inhibitor could also positively influence metabolic parameter , support study show decrease serum epinephrine increase insulin stimulate glucose uptake normotensive volunteer treat ACE inhibitor . In animal model hypertension , ACE inhibitor positive effect reduction free fatty acid level therefore positive effect insulin action . 3 . AT1 receptor blockade ( sartans ) result elevate plasma Ang II concentration preferential stimulation AT2 receptor . Compared AT1 , stimulation AT2 receptor exert antagonistic effect induce vasodilatation , apoptosis , inhibit growth proliferation vascular smooth muscle cell . In addition , high Ang II concentration seem upregulate low level even re-express miss AT2 receptor adult rat adipose tissue . ACE2 expression also upregulated AT1 blockade thus increase concentration angiotensin ( 1-7 ) vivo human assume even study yet . Angiotensin ( 1-7 ) bind preferentially non-blocked AT2 receptor evoke additional depressor activity via kinin/NO/cGMP cascade induce vasodilatation improvement hemodynamics . Overall , ACE inhibition exert beneficial effect blood pressure via decrease Ang II concentration elevate bradykinin . On hand , blockade AT1 receptor cause simultaneous overstimulation AT2 receptor elevate concentration Ang II , angiotensin ( 1-7 ) angiotensin A positive effect adipogenesis result change regulatory mechanism influence insulin action . The sartans insulin-sensitizing effect ; exact mechanism unknown far . Some AT1 receptor blocker display weak peroxisome proliferator activator receptor ( PPARγ ) agonist activity might promote adipocyte differentiation . However , sartans without PPARγ-agonist activity significant effect adipocyte downsize improvement insulin sensitivity marker well . These result suggest may distinct mechanism , direct activation PPARγ responsible adipocyte differentiation improvement metabolic parameter . It suppose adipose tissue , except systemic hemodynamic sympatholytic effect responsible insulin-sensitizing effect sartans . In last 20 year , adipose tissue well study , since consider energy storage also source several substance - hormone , enzymes bioactive peptide generally call adipokines . Human rat adipose tissue contain complete local renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) . Components adipose RAS undergo significant change amount adipose tissue adipocyte size enlarge . This lead assumption , RAS play important role regulation adipose tissue mass . In vitro study show Ang II inhibit adipocyte differentiation result increase proportion large insulin-resistant adipocytes ectopic lipid deposition tissue . In large adipocytes , expression production TNF increase adiponectin secretion inhibit AT1 receptor . TNF cytokine impair insulin action , highly express adipose tissue obesity metabolic syndrome . It known insulin sensitivity adipocytes decrease size . RAS blockade stimulates adipogenesis adipose tissue , probably via stimulation AT2 receptor result increased number small insulin-sensitive cell . Several author observe decrease adipocyte size retroperitoneal epididymal adipose tissue line improve insulin sensitivity RAS blockade rat . Blockade AT1 receptor co-culture human preadipocytes adipocytes lead also increase adipogenesis . It assume vivo blockade RAS might result increased proportion small adipocytes due adipogenesis simultaneous decrease number large cell due apoptosis . The increased proportion small adipocytes reflect change expression release adipokines produce adiponectin less TNF . Indeed , blockade RAS elevate serum concentration adiponectin patient essential hypertension . In rat , serum concentration well mRNA expression adiponectin PPARγ adipose tissue increase . PPARγ play probably role mechanism related effect RAS inhibition change adipose tissue amount insulin sensitivity . In vivo human body , knowledge change production RAS component relation adiposity cellularity adipose tissue , adipokines secretion parameter insulin sensitivity study yet .</detailed_description>
