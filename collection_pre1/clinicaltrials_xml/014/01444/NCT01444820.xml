	<brief_summary>In North America , around quarter million men diagnosed prostate cancer every year , 31,000 patient die disease year . Like western country , incidence Canada increase due age population prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) screening . This lead significant demand cancer care service patient . Prostate cancer patient high risk feature often treat external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) plus two three year hormonal manipulation ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [ LHRH ] agonist ) . The common radiation dose treatment patient 74-78 Gy 37-39 daily fraction 180-200 cGy treatment length 7.5 week . This fraction size believe offer best balance desire tumour kill unwanted normal tissue injury . Larger fraction size 250 cGy ( hypofractionation ) usually avoid curative therapy late react normal tissue . However prostate cancer cell unique radiobiology characteristic suggests hypofractionated radiotherapy efficient prostate tumour kill standard fractionation , produce equivalent tumour control low total dose short overall treatment time . Improved target localization technique conformal radiation therapy technology allow dose escalation hypofractionated radiation delivery circumstance minimal increased toxicity . This trial design determine whether high risk prostate cancer patient safely treat dose escalation hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 week oppose usual 7-8 week . These patient randomize either usual 76 Gy 38 fraction 68 Gy 25 fraction . 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) use deliver require radiation dose . Patients also receive 28 month androgen deprivation therapy ( LHRH agonist ) . The primary outcome study acute delay toxicity secondary outcome include biochemical failure , prostate specific mortality rate , bone metastasis free survival , prognostic predictive value several biological variable : presence PTEN deletion ; expression FoxP3 gene variant , topoisomerase 2α cancer testis antigens ; expression X chromosome-linked micro-RNAs ; presence TMRSS2-ERG gene fusion quality life . It plan recruit 250 patient study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate diagnose within 6 month prior randomization 2 . Patient classify high risk define clinically : T3 T4 , Gleason Score &gt; 8 , and/ PSA &gt; 20 ( ng/mL μg/L ) . 3 . Pelvic paraaortic lymph node must negative computerized tomography ( CT scan ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdomen pelvis perform within 12 week prior randomization . 4 . Investigations , include chest Xray chest CT scan bone scan ( radiographs suspicious area ) perform within 12 week prior randomization negative metastasis . 5 . Patients PSA test do time diagnosis . This PSA test could repeat within 28 day prior randomization . 6 . The patient may receive prior androgen suppression therapy provide androgen suppression therapy commence 28 day prior randomization . 7 .
