	<criteria>Pathological radiographic diagnosis paninvasive pituitary macroadenoma Paninvasive purpose protocol define meeting follow 2 major criterion : ( 1 ) . tumor volume great 20 cc enrollment , ( 2 ) . suprasellar extension . In addition , paninvasive tumor must meet one follow 3 minor criterion , ) unresectable tumor invasion cavernous sinus , b ) bone bone marrow invasion clivus temporal bone , c ) tumor extension direction unlikely completely remove specifically transphenoidal surgical approach . Patients meet two major criterion ( 1 2 ) medically inoperable tumor resection ( due confound coexist medical problem ) eligible without meet three minor criterion ( , b , c ) . Patients immediately threaten vision loss significant neurological impairment directly relate tumor mass effect . As , patient enrol would likely benefit tumor response ( shrinkage ) . Patients must visible tumor image study ( MRI CT ) The patient 's Zubrod performance status must 03 . Patients must least 18 year age . Mandatory Imaging Studies : Must do 45 few day prior : MRI CT scan brain include entire skull base area tumor extension Patients unable undergo general anesthesia Patients unable undergo placement stereotactic head frame Patients unable provide inform consent Patients pregnant nursing Patients severe kidney dysfunction Patients contraindication MRI , implant pacemaker device Patients diagnosis pituitary carcinoma</criteria>
