	<brief_summary>The vaccine contain humanize recombinant antigen ( Epithelial Growth Factor ) adjuvant . The antibody induce vaccination react circulate EGF lead removal EGF circulation . As result , bind target EGF-Receptor prevent . Blocking EGF-Receptor prevent activation stimulation proliferation tumour cell . A Phase III clinical trial EGF vaccine ongoing Cuba . The result previous study demonstrate positive correlation extend survival immune response vaccination late-stage NSCLC patient ' age 60 improve quality life . The purpose international Phase III trial determine whether recombinant human EGF cancer vaccine safe , immunogenic effective treatment stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patient compare standard treatment supportive care .</brief_summary>
