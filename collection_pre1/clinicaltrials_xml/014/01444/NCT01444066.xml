	<brief_title>The Role Of Empiric Dilation In Patients With Dysphagia With Normal Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysphagia typically refer sensation food stick throat chest ( esophageal dysphagia ) well difficulty initiation swallow ( oropharyngeal dysphagia ) . It typically classify oropharyngeal esophageal dysphagia . Oropharyngeal dysphagia typically result neuromuscular disease well head neck malignancy diagnose basis history physical examination case . Patients esophageal dysphagia sub-classified two group ; obvious abnormality esophageal mucosa motility endoscopy normal finding endoscopic examination . The diagnosis treatment patient dysphagia abnormal finding endoscopy extensively study well-define practice guideline avail subject . In contrast management strategy group patient esophageal type dysphagia normal appear esophagus upper endoscopy ( DNE ) topic controversy decade . Those patient DNE think fall several category , subtle stricture ring esophagus see endoscopy , well patient non-erosive reflux disease , eosinophilic esophagitis , primary motility disorder esophagus , finally `` functional '' dysphagia ( cause identify ) . Several approach advocate evaluation treatment patient DNE , include trial proton pump inhibitor therapy , obtain random biopsy exclude eosinophilic esophagitis non-erosive reflux disease , referral manometry esophageal pH monitoring , well empiric esophageal dilation large caliber bougie . Of option empiric esophageal dilation large diameter bougie initial management approach recommend recent AGA guideline well many expert field esophagology , treatment DNE . The initial evidence empiric esophageal dilation patient DNE come retrospective study Marshal et al , find 50 % patient experience sustained improvement symptom follow dilation large diameter bougie . This follow randomize control trial Colon coworkers , find significant benefit empiric esophageal bougie dilation . However , two randomized trial mid-2000 's find benefit empiric esophageal dilation ; although dilation method use study differ used Marshal Colon et al . Despite conflict result empiric dilation continue popular community gastroenterologist , perceive safe effective intervention treat patient DEN . A recent study Olson et al find empiric dilation DNE perform commonly dilation dilation esophageal stricture United States associate 0.65 % complication rate . Additionally , current era financial pressure medical community empiric dilation DNE time first diagnostic upper endoscopy could lead significant saving effective relieving symptom ; obviate need diagnostic testing , medication repeat endoscopy . With mind , goal conduct randomize control trial evaluate role empiric dilation patient DNE , help fill exist gap medical literature . Specifically , prior study lack regard three important point . First , esophageal manometry pH monitoring uniformly perform patient ; test crucial exclude esophageal motility disorder non-erosive reflux disease , think cause DNE . Second , esophageal biopsy perform study ; become standard part evaluation patient DNE past 5 year , eosinophilic esophagitis non-erosive reflux disease lead dysphagia may miss without microscopic examination esophageal mucosa . Finally , none study use standardize validated dysphagia questionnaire , Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire ( MDQ ) evaluate symptom .</detailed_description>
