	<detailed_description>Impaired incomplete recovery follow high intensity exercise negatively affect physical performance delay functional progression , thereby reduce athlete 's chance performing peak level . Athletes constantly seek way speed muscle recovery strenuous exercise muscle damage . Anabolic steroid potent stimulators muscle growth repair use extensively athletes hasten structural functional recovery peak period strenuous training . However , anabolic steroid classify ban substance major sport organize committee oversee regulate amateur professional athletics . In addition long-term use anabolic steroid know side effect negatively impact athlete 's health status . Dietary supplement safe viable alternative , take optimal dos , provide positive effect muscle growth repair ultimately human performance . Athletes use dietary supplement extensively facilitate tissue growth repair follow muscle-damaging event high-intensity resistance exercise participation contact sport . Following intense resistance exercise , acute inflammatory response drive repair process synthesize release chemical mediator locally injured muscle . Inflammatory mediator help attract growth factor use protein synthesis . The inflammatory response also show produce high level oxygen-derived free radical allow proceed unabated , produce muscle damage , thus hinder repair process . A protein-based dietary supplement , take optimal dosing schedule , may enhance recovery process blunt magnitude acute inflammatory response facilitate growth repair increase protein synthesis damage muscle tissue . Understanding nutritional requirement athlete engage high intensity train competition necessary insure adequate recovery exercise bout . This improve training functional gain well act prophylaxis skeletal muscle injury . The objective study assess effectiveness nutritional supplement muscle functional recovery follow induced muscle damage high intensity resistance exercise . This accomplish evaluate baseline change course recovery phase severity symptomatic response functional impairment post-exercise skeletal muscle damage . The biceps brachii muscle target study . The investigator establish safe effective experimental arm curl model induce skeletal muscle soreness dysfunction human subject use eccentric exercise bicep brachii muscle .</detailed_description>
