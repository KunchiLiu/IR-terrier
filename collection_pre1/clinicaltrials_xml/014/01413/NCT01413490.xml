	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus one leading cause liver failure liver cancer worldwide . Current treatment hepatitis C infection successful half eligible . The current treatment aim boost host immune system directly act virus . Many drug various stage development target virus directly - specific mode action confirm show virus force adapt presence drug . As many virus , treat one specific drug would quickly lead virus adapt become resistant . We therefore need find new combination directly act drug . Rimantadine already show laboratory target hepatitis C directly . We design study see happen real life well . If , could use rimantadine help fight hepatitis c effectively .</brief_summary>
