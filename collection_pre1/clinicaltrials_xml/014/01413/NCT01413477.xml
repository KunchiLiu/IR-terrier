	<brief_summary>Nickel contact dermatitis ( eczema ) one common allergic condition affect skin . This study look potentially desensitize nickel-allergic patient allergy use anti-inflammatory ointment apply skin ( arm ) . Application ointment ( ie . modify Vitamin D ) show increase specific immune cell ( T regulatory cell ) , play role prevent immune activation subsequently inflammation . The investigator propose use topical anti-inflammatory agent ( corticosteroid , modify Vitamin D , ) may desensitize patient nickel allergy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nickel Desensitization Using Topical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : To evaluate whether topical anti-inflammatory ointment ( calcipotriol , betamethasone dipropionate , combination ) decrease sensitivity nickel know nickel allergic patient . Optional blood sample part protocol measure immune response . 2 . Hypothesis : Use topical agent prevent sensitization nickel sulfate upon re-exposure . 3 . Justification : Currently , cure yet offer nickel sensitive patient . Standard treatment involve avoid nickel-containing product . However , always easily achieve depend patient awareness environmental exposure . Topical desensitization yet explore patient pre-established contact allergy . This research placebo-controlled Vaseline petroleum jelly compare reaction nickel treat anti-inflammatory ointment . 4 . Objectives : ) To evaluate use topical anti-inflammatory agent role desensitize know nickel allergic patient nickel . b ) To measure immune cell response nickel allergen blood sample take topical anti-inflammatory application . 5 . Research Method : Randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , proof principle study . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion know nickel sensitivity recruit study . Those consent undergo 3 set nickel patch testing : At week 1 confirm nickel allergic status , week 3 induce tolerance patch test site topical ointment application , finally week 5 test desensitization . ( Week 2 self-application topical ointment ; Week 4 rest week ) . 6 . Statistical Analysis : ) Primary end-point : Clinical response measure standard patch test score document photograph comparison . b ) Secondary end-point : Levels T regulatory cell responses topical treatment . c ) Planned sample size : 24 patient . Given proof-of-principle study , investigator choose study small sample size detect difference amongst treatment arm , . A larger-scale , adequately-powered study would need detect statistical significance .</detailed_description>
