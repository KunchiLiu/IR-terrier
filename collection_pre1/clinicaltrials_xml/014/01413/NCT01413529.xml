	<brief_title>HEART HAART : Smartphone Intervention Improve HAART Adherence Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : HIV infect drug user great difficulty adhere HAART compare non-drug user . As sustained adherence critical reduce HIV related morbidity mortality , innovative potentially sustainable treatment strategy optimize durability adherence enhance intervention among drug user urgently need . Increasingly , intervention use communication technology ( e.g. , smartphones ) assess enhance treatment use variety somatic , mental health substance abuse condition . Innovation/Approach : Consistent National Institute Drug Abuse 's mission develop novel technological base intervention promote adherence HAART goal study use stage model behavioral therapy research adapt , develop , complete preliminary usability pilot test smart phone base intervention call HEART ( Helping Enhance Adherence Retroviral therapy use Technology ) HAART , enhance , promote , improve long-term adherence HAART among HIV infect drug user non-methadone maintenance setting . Informed Wagner 's Chronic Care Model , HEART HAART intervention design enhance ongoing adherence counsel providing ( 1 ) real time information medication adherence ( use Wisepill device ) ; ( 2 ) periodic assessment medication side effect , depressive symptom drug use frequency ( link poor adherence among drug user ) use ecological momentary assessment ( 3 ) tailor education , recommendation encouragement base assessment . The participant ( use phone ) adherence team ( use clinician interface ) jointly track real time change adherence increase potential share decision-making . This proposal three aim consistent stage 1A 1B stage behavioral therapy research . Aims 1 2 seek adapt develop ( Stage 1A ) HEART HAART . Aims 1 2 use iterative user-centered design allow end user system influence design take shape increase ease system learn use . Aim 3 test preliminary efficacy ( Stage 1B ) finalize form HEART HAART . In aim 3 , total 50 HIV infect , drug user receive adherence counsel urban , outpatient HIV clinic randomly assign receive either HEART HAART versus usual care addition smart phone control . The intervention last 24 week primary outcome change adherence measure unannounced telephone base random pill count . Changes biological outcome include HIV viral load CD4 count also evaluate . Implication : If show acceptable efficacious HEART HAART may introduce fundamentally new method HAART medication self-management provide tailor , potentially sustainable less cost intensive intervention increase adherence among HIV infect drug user long term .</detailed_description>
