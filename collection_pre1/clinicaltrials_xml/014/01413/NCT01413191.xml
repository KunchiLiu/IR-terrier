	<brief_title>Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate metastatic uveal melanoma treat IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) . II . To determine safety tolerability IMC-A12 patient metastatic uveal melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine disease control rate patient treat IMC-A12 . II . To determine duration response patient treat IMC-A12 . III . To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treat IMC-A12 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate presence GNAQ GNA11 mutation response IMC-A12 . II . To correlate expression IGF-1R response IMC-A12 . III . To determine effect IMC-A12 expression protein involve initiation , growth , spread uveal melanoma cell . IV . To determine resistance mechanisms IMC-A12 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived fresh tumor tissue serum sample may collect correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
