	<brief_summary>Background : - Amatuximab cancer treatment drug target mesothelin . High level substance find kind tumor cell . Lab study show amatuximab help immune system kill cell high level mesothelin . However , research need determine safe effective amatuximab treat tumor high level mesothelin . Objectives : - To assess safety effectiveness amatuximab treat tumor high level mesothelin . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age type cancer overexpresses mesothelin . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood test tumor assessment study . - Participants two intravenous dos amatuximab several hour apart . Researchers monitor closely frequent blood draw . On day also within 48 hour second dose , participant image study . These study measure well amatuximab work cancer . - Participants third image study cancer 1 week infusion . - Participants followup visit 2 week receive amatuximab . This visit require blood sample . Four week receive drug , researcher review patient symptoms side effect . This interview do person phone ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Amatuximab high-affinity monoclonal IgG antibody raise human mesothelin . - Mesothelin glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-linked membrane glycoprotein think involved tumor metastasis - Mesothelin over-expressed many cancer Objectives : -The primary objective determine biodistribution radiolabeled amatuximab tumor nontumor tissue subject mesothelin over-expressing cancer include mesothelioma , pancreatic , ovarian , non small cell lung cancer . Eligibility : - Female male subject great equal 18 year age ; - Histologically confirm mesothelin-expressing cancer ; - Transaminases less equal 3 time ULN mesothelioma , non small cell lung ovarian cancer ; - Transaminases less equal 5 time ULN pancreatic cancer know liver metastasis . Design : - This single-center , single-dose , open-label , pilot study MORAb-009 approximately 20 subject mesothelin express tumor . - Indium-radiolabeled MORAb-009 ( 5mCi ) administer . - Serial single photon emission-computerized tomography imaging perform determine binding tumor nontumor tissue . - Subjects observe closely safety possible development anti-MORAb-009 antibody . - Pharmacokinetics radiolabeled antibody determine imaging time .</detailed_description>
