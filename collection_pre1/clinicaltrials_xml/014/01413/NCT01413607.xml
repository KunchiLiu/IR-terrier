	<brief_summary>The objective study ass whether use different type suture ( barbed suture ) partial nephrectomy result fewer postoperative complication traditional suture ( non-barbed ) . The common complication urine leakage bleeding . The investigator believe barb suture less technically difficult use allow surgeon well repair hole leave kidney tumor remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Self Retaining Sutures Open Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With increase use radiographic image abdominal complaint incidental find small asymptomatic renal mass increase . Partial nephrectomy become gold standard therapy treatment kidney mass ≤7cm size . Absolute indication partial nephrectomy include bilateral renal tumor , systemic condition affect renal function , chronic renal insufficiency solitary kidney function . Elective indication include mass ≤7cm normal contralateral kidney function . The procedure complete either laparoscopic open technique . Complication rate open partial nephrectomy report 16 % common urinary leak , postoperative bleeding , renal insufficiency need dialysis . A major predictor postoperative complication warm ischemia time . This length time kidney without blood flow body temperature . It report renal cellular damage nephron begin 20-30 minute ischemia . As well , volume estimate blood loss show major predictor postoperative complication . A threshold value estimate blood loss &gt; 750 mL warm ischemia time &gt; 45 minute associate significantly increase rate postoperative complication . Recent advancement laparoscopic technique lead development early unclamping method partial nephrectomy . In method renal pedicle unclamped follow initial central run suture defect entirely repair bolstering suture . This method report decrease warm ischemia time ≥50 % comparison traditional technique unclamping full closure defect . The investigator demonstrate safety `` Quill '' ( Angiotech , Vancouver , BC ) polydioxanone barb self retaining suture retrospective series . These suture contain unidirectionally orient barbs surface switch direction half-way point . Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy technically demanding procedure maintain tension intracorporeal suture particularly challenge . The barb self retain suture lock tissue allow surgeon preserve tissue approximation without need maintain tension . The investigator believe suture allow surgeon obtain great tissue approximation therefore decrease postoperative urinary leakage bleeding . These finding need validate postoperatively . The investigator believe couple short warm ischemia time early unclamping method great tissue approximation afford self retain suture result few complication follow partial nephrectomy .</detailed_description>
