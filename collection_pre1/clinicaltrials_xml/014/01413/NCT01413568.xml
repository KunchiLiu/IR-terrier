	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy POL6326 Mobilization/Transplant Sibling Donor Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current protocol use G-CSF mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cell match sibling donor . This process require four six day G-CSF injection associate significant morbidity , notably bone pain . POL6326 associate side effect collection cell occur day POL6326 administration . This study evaluate safety efficacy novel agent hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization allogeneic transplantation base follow hypothesis : 1 . Donors mobilize intravenous POL6326 require few collection previously see donor mobilize subcutaneous plerixafor . 2 . Healthy HLA-matched donor receive one two infusion POL6326 mobilize sufficient CD34+ cell ( least 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight ) follow leukapheresis support hematopoietic cell transplant . 3 . IV POL6326 result rapid kinetics higher maximum ( peak ) human CD34+ stem cell mobilize human normal allogeneic donor compare previous donor mobilize plerixafor . 4 . The hematopoietic cell mobilize IV POL6326 functional result prompt durable hematopoietic engraftment follow transplantation HLA-identical sibling advance hematological malignancy use various non-myeloablative myeloablative conditioning regimen regimens routine GVHD prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
