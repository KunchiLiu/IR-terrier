	<detailed_description>Introduction The term hemiplegia/hemiparesis use neural deficit may occur patient acquire brain injury ( ABI ) , cerebral palsy , traumatic injury brain , cerebrovascular accident . The word hemiplegia mean neuromuscular disorder involve one-half body frontal plane half involve . Hemiparetic gait follow ABI grossly characterize decreased speed walking , increase stance time unaffected side , decrease stance time affected side . Joint-angle disturbance include reduction loss knee flexion phase stance , reduction knee flexion swing phase , sometimes loss dorsiflexion ankle swing phase initial contact , generally reduce joint excursion . Lehmann et [ 1 ] report greater-than-normal internal knee flexion moment mid-stance person hemiplegia , feature think related anterior movement center gravity . ( `` Internal '' moment express internal link-segment model ; `` external '' moment express act upon link-segment model . ) The internal moment usually result muscle activity , though tension structure posterior knee may also involve knee fully extend . Patients hemiplegia exhibit disturbed mechanical energy pattern overall energy cost normal [ 2 ] . The affected limb characteristically show tonic extensor activity , co-activation major muscle group , loss selective muscle control stance [ 3 ] . The patterns activity presence co-activation walking use classify gait subject hemiplegia [ 4 ] . Muscle power pattern major lower-limb joint walk near normal shape reduce amplitude , muscle affect side provide 40 % positive work [ 5 ] . These abnormality associate complex pattern dysfunction include muscle weakness , spasticity , impaired sensory-motor control long-term mechanical change muscle joint [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , cognitive impairment e.g . attention . At stage knowledge still unclear kinetic kinematic parameter hemiparetic gait provide insight different component complex pattern dysfunction . Subjects hemiparesis show different reaction change pattern treadmill , like gait velocity inclination comparison healthy subject . Especially perform investigation challenge condition may reveal relevant insight contribution different component complex pattern hemiparetic gait . Qualitative quantitative evaluation gait perform clinical examination gait examination gait laboratory deliver temporal spatial parameter . These parameter relate automatism symmetry two main component gait . Goals study : 1 . To assess variability data derive Zebris ( ZIT ) device . 2 . To investigate stability hemiparetic gait . 3 . To evaluate variability relevant gait parameter take place recovery acute ABI . 4 . To compare gait ground gait treadmill . Method Participants : The population study consists three follow group : 1 . 15 patient subacute ABI , define first 3 month insult . 2 . 15 patient chronic ABI , define least one year insult . 3 . 15 age gender match healthy control . Study design Instrumentation- 1 . `` ZEBRIS - treadmill '' - The ZIT consist ordinary treadmill equip 'mat ' 5000 high-quality capacitive pressure/force sensor ( Fig . 1 ) . The instrument PC link via USB interface . A dedicated program process analog signal sensor ( vertical component ground reaction force ) frequency 1000 Hz . Using technology specially develop ZEBRIS , movement treadmill compensate completely stable gait roll-off pattern analyze . The measurement perform Motion Laboratory Sheba Medical Center . 2 . GaitRite - An electronic walkway contains eight sensor pad encapsulate roll carpet produce active area 24 inch ( 61cm ) wide 192 inch ( 488cm ) long . In arrangement active area grid , 48 sensor 384 sensor place .5 inch ( 1.27 cm ) center , total 18,432 sensor . The walkway portable , lay flat surface , require minimal setup test time , require placement device patient . As patient ambulates across walkway , system capture geometry relative arrangement footfall function time . The application software control functionality walkway , process raw data footfall pattern , compute temporal ( time ) spatial ( distance ) parameter . The software 's relational database store test individually patient , support variety report analysis . Procedure 1 . Demographic data data clinical examination use NIH scale collect . 2 . Participants walk comfortable speed 4 sweep GaitRite sensor mat , order collect free ( unconstrained ) walk spatio-temporal parameter . Optimal velocity determine use habitual condition namely shoe AFO patient ( case use routine circumstance ) shoe subject . Using stopwatch , comfortable walk speed calculate net distance 6 m. 3 . Using ZIT , patient subject first tether cable . Tests conduct subject wear everyday clothing shoe . Those patient wear AFO test device . Normal stance first assess without shoe without visual feedback ( EO , EC condition ) . Then paradigm gait treadmill . Normal stance first assess shoe without visual feedback ( EO , EC condition ) . Then paradigm gait treadmill ( base [ 5 ] ) . 4 . At stage treadmill motor initiate target speed reach within 10-20s . At target speed ( base [ 2 ] ) , subject spend 20 gait record speed another 20 . Immediately follow , speed increase 10 % feasible total 20 % comfortable individual speed epoch 20 record . Following epoch , treadmill speed reduce target subject spend additional 20 raise front end platform 3° . At incline subject walk 10-15s final epoch 20 , condition record . Following final epoch , incline return horizontal speed reduce zero allow subject dismount ZIT . 5 . Walking treadmill initially unfamiliar experience . Therefore , data collection start soon patient comfortable set-up le 2 min initiation test approximately six minute familiarization time . Timing - The normal control group chronic ABI hemiparetic subject group test twice period 2-7 day establish measurement error ( absolute reproducibility ) . The subacute ABI hemiparetic subject group reassess 4 -6 week 1st data collection . Time Frame study Data collection : 2nd final Data collection perform 1st accord protocol - For normal control chronic ABI hemiparetic subject group 2-7 day 1st data collection . - For subacute ABI hemiparetic subject group 4 -6 week 1st data collection . We expect finish Data collection one year start study . Data analysis do 1 year Data collection . Summarize study 6 month Data analysis . In case unexpected event study NIH local Helsinki committee inform within two week . Rationale study- Basic assumption study : 1 . No significant change gait parameter expect group include healthy control chronic ABI subject recurrent examination within week period . 2 . Subacute ABI patient find within context neurorehabilitative recovery due brain plasticity . Therefore change gait parameter expect within two consecutive examination choose time interval . 3 . All measurement subject error contribute variance outcome . On ground assumption : A . Two consecutive examination group include healthy control chronic ABI subject intend estimate error measure value . B . Two consecutive examination subacute ABI patient group intend estimate contribution neurorehabilitative recovery due brain plasticity assess unique research instrumentation . Analysis - In general term , analysis base 2X2 design namely , subject ( ABI vs. normal ) within ( bilateral ) comparison . The spatio-temporal parameter calculate force sensor consist listed report sheet ( enclose report ) . Assessment parameter : The temporal parameter calculate ground reaction force function time follow : - Length stance phase ( stance time ) [ tstance - ] - Length swing phase ( swing time ) [ tswing−s ] - Length double support phase [ tdouble−s ] - time step [ tstep - ] The spatial parameter calculate temporal parameter constant gait speed [ vgait - m/s ] follow [ 16 ] : - Cadence [ c - step/minutes ] - Step length [ lstep - mm ] - Stride [ length ] ) . These commonly use parameter gait laboratory . The footprint template assess location pressure prominent pressure focus location . In addition , ZIT software produce ground force pressure report well special representation movement trajectory center pressure ( COP ) point gait cycle . Due shape , trajectory know 'butterfly ' . From butterfly , area base gait calculate . Statistical analysis : Data processing consist descriptive inferential statistic . In case normal distribution outcome parameter , general 2X2 ANOVA carry .</detailed_description>
