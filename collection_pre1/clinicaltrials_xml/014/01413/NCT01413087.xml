	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open label , randomize , phase 2b study , design evaluate safety efficacy patient locally advance pancreatic adenocarcinoma follow intratumoral administration BC-819 intravenously administer gemcitabine . Intratumoral injection BC-819 perform use endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . Primary Objective : To assess effect intratumoral endoscopic ultrasound injection BC-819 administer intravenous gemcitabine progression-free survival . Secondary Objectives : To compare effect intratumoral injection BC-819 administer combination intravenous gemcitabine vs. intravenous gemcitabine alone : Overall survival , Response rate , Resectability target tumor lesion , Quality life , Safety , Serological Tumor Marker : CA 19-9 , Duration response , Failure-free survival</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BC-819 ( also know DTA-H19 ) double-stranded DNA plasmid , 4,560 base pair ( bp ) length , carry gene Diphtheria toxin A ( DT-A ) chain regulation H19 promoter . This Targeted Cancer Therapy ; DT-A chain expression trigger presence H19 transcription factor up-regulated tumor cell . The selective initiation toxin expression result selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition protein synthesis selectively tumor cell , enable highly targeted cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
