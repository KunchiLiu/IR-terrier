	<brief_title>Iodine I 131 Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer Previously Treated With Iodine I 131 That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability feasibility administrate escalate dos 131I ( iodine I 131 ) combination concurrent pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) therapy order define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) patient radioiodine ( RAI ) -refractory disease minor RAI-uptake . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect pazopanib combination 131I RAI-avidity , uptake tumor response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] version 1.1 ) . II . To determine time tumor progression ( TTP ) recurrence ( progression determine RECIST criterion increase suppress thyroglobulin level &gt; 50 % compare tumor image suppress thyroglobulin level perform within 1 week last dose pazopanib ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study iodine I 131 . Patients receive iodine I 131 intramuscularly ( IM ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week week 5-6 . Patients also receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) QD begin week 1 continue 8 week post-radioactive iodine therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
