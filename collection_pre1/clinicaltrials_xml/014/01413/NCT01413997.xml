	<detailed_description>The differential motion specific connective tissue stratum measure tissue displacement ( linear oscillation ) initiate computer-controlled needle stimulus tool ( NST ) . The CTMM suitable outcome measure mechanistic clinical study CAM intervention . The CTMM also potentially serve clinical diagnostic treatment-monitoring tool manual therapist , acupuncturists , CAM clinicians interested assess functional status patient 's connective tissue .</detailed_description>
