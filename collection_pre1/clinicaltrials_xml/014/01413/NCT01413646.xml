	<brief_title>Effects Walnuts Endothelial Function Overweight Adults With Least One Factor Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity adult child United States increase significantly past 50 year . More 66 % adult US overweight obese least 17 % child population large consider overweight.Obesity may factor predispose patient myriad comorbidities increase associate mortality rate.Several large prospective trial document obesity independent risk factor mortality cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Considering major metabolic biochemical change occur obesity , atherogenic dyslipidemia , insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia , endothelial dysfunction , chronic inflammatory prothrombotic state , obesity play role pathogenesis systemic atherosclerosis clinical complication . Walnuts rich alpha-linolenic acid , essential omega-3 fatty acid , L-arginine antioxidant . Polyunsaturated fatty acid antioxidant anti-oxidative effect think help preserve endothelium 's capacity generate nitric oxide ( NO ) , act promote vasodilation , stabilize platelet , promote anti-inflammatory ability endothelium . Evidence anticipated effect would implications strategy prevent retard type 2 diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease . Endothelial function test use high frequency ultrasound image brachial artery ass endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) offer non-invasive , uniquely valuable mean assess aggregated influence cardiac risk gauge physiologic response vascular endothelium . Proposed , therefore , randomize , control , cross-over clinical trial , assess effect walnuts endothelial function overweight adult elevated waist circumference least one risk factor metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
