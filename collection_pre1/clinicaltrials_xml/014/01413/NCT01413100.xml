	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin together follow peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) mycophenolate mofetil work treat patient systemic scleroderma ( SSc ) . Stem cell collect patient 's blood store prior treatment . To store stem cell patient give colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide ) help stem cell move bone marrow blood collect store . After storage , patient give high-dose chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , immunosuppression anti-thymocyte globulin suppress immune system prepare transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy immunosuppression . After stem cell `` engraft '' mature enough support immune system approximately 2-3 month , patient give medication call mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) Myfortic . This medication give prevent worsen reactivation SSc refer maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scleroderma Treatment With Autologous Transplant ( STAT ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety potential efficacy high-dose immunosuppressive therapy ( HDIT ) follow autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) ( without cluster differentiation [ CD ] 34-selection ) maintenance therapy mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) systemic scleroderma ( SSc ) patient evaluate effect event-free survival ( EFS ) 5 year post-transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety HDIT follow autologous HCT determine regimen-related toxicity , infectious complication , treatment-related mortality , overall total mortality , time engraftment . II . To evaluate treatment effect disease activation/progression . III . To evaluate health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) use Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) , St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) , modify scleroderma health assessment questionnaire ( SHAQ ) , PROMIS version ( v ) 1.0 measure . IV . To assess work productivity ( Work Productivity Survey ) health care utilization ( use University California San-Diego [ UCSD ] healthcare utilization ) . OUTLINE : STEM CELL MOBILIZATION AND PREPARATION : Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) mobilization day 1-4 followed apheresis target dose CD34+ cell &gt; = 2.5 x 10^6/kg collect . Patients difficult mobilize filgrastim alone receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) *plerixafor subcutaneously ( SC ) mobilization day 1-2 filgrastim SC mobilization day 5-7 . HDIT CONDITIONING : Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV 1-2 hour day -5 -2 anti-thymocyte globulin IV day -5 , -3 , -1 , 1 , 3 , 5 . TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo autologous PBSCT day 0 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 2-3 month transplant , patient receive mycophenolate mofetil orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 2 year . NOTE : *Plerixafor alternative cyclophosphamide base mobilization . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , week 12 26 , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
