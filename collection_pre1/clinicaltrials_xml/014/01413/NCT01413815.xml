	<brief_summary>The aim study test whether pre-operative oral supplementation L-arginine result significant reduction peri-operative cardiovascular complication rate unselected patient undergo major abdominal thoracic ( non-cardiac ) surgery . The second aim study ass whether pre-operative determination plasma ADMA level allow identify patient high risk experience peri-operative complication , whether subgroup patient profit specifically pre-operative L-arginine supplementation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Amino Acid L-arginine Perioperative Cardio-vascular Risk Non-selected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit study participate Departments . In previous study ( protocol . UKE-KP 2002/006 ) investigate predictive role ADMA ( asymmetric dimethylarginine ) peri-operative complication unselected patient undergo major surgery . The major result study patient pre-operative ADMA plasma level within high quartile distribution significantly elevate risk experience serious peri-operative complication within period 30 day surgical intervention . These data publish [ Maas et al . 2007 ] . As ADMA competitively displace L-arginine enzyme , NO synthase , expect adverse cardiovascular effect high ADMA level antagonize supplemental L-arginine . Therefore , present study design specifically address question whether dietary supplementation L-arginine surgery , aim replenish body ` L-arginine store , may help reduce peri- operative complication rate . Another aim ass whether occurs patient specifically subgroup elevated baseline ADMA level . Study participant recruit patient routinely visit outpatient clinic participate Departments Anesthesiology Intensive Care advance plan surgical intervention . Patients usually visit clinic five work day advance schedule time surgery , admit in-patient treatment one two day surgery . They inform scope aim study , give informed consent , patient receive L-arginine dietary supplement correspond placebo accord randomisation plan time surgery . The last dosage L-arginine supplement take morning surgery , dissolve glass tap water patient ware require drink premedication anesthesia . Blood sample measure plasma L-arginine ADMA level take time inclusion , morning schedule surgery , day 1 3 surgery together additional safety parameter exceed 80ml . No administration study product occur surgery . After surgery take place , patient monitor daily long remain treated in-patients , clinical event , change laboratory parameter , apparatively perform clinical test schedule accord clinical routine document . No additional clinical treating perform study participant , except blood sample take described . After discharge , patient followed-up telephonically , last time 30 day date surgery . All clinical event occur period record . In addition , change laboratory value , ECG recording , apparative diagnostic measure check possible complication , also record .</detailed_description>
