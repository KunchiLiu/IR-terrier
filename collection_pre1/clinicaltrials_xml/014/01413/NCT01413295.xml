	<brief_summary>The different alternative use since 1996 treat metastatic colorectal cancer ( MCRC ) increase mean survival patient . This outstanding advance due extend indication resection hepatic metastasis use new chemotherapeutic drug ( fluoropyrimidine , irinotecan oxaliplatin ) monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab , cetuximab panitumumab ) . However , none treatment curative majority patient overwhelm illness . The first line treatment MCRC FOLFOX second , irinotecan plus cetuximab patient wild type KRAS gene ( 60 % ) 30 % response , bevacizumab plus irinotecan 5-10 % response , patient mutate KRAS ( 40 % ) . A treatment autologous dendritic cell ( DCs ) pulse autologous tumour antigen propose third line therapy . A randomized phase II trial would perform , select two group patient , one would treat best supportive treatment DCs plus best supportive treatment . The aim study would analyze outcome 4 month treatment . In patient treated DCs , IFN-γ spot form cell proliferative response would determine pre post treatment lymphocytes stimulate autologous DCs pulse autologous tumour antigen . Pre post treatment serum level IFN-γ , TNF-α , TGF-β e IL-12 , would also measure .</brief_summary>
