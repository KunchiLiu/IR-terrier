	<brief_summary>The main objective one year multidisciplinary research estimate frequency seropositive men sex men ( MSM ) antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) undetectable blood viral load ( VL ) detectable VL semen . Design : Participants'inclusion ( n=150 ) do 6 HIV hospital department participate research project . To warrant feasibility diversity participant need , center locate Paris nearby suburb . The study design base one blood semen sample take day 0 day 30 . Blood semen sample take enrolment center . Biological virological analysis perform laboratory microbiology Necker hospital , blood semen sample . Pharmacological analysis plan subsequent study . Socio-behavioral data collect self-administered questionnaire day 0 day 30 . Schedule : Patients ' enrolment , collection biological sample questionnaire last 10 month ( end first quarter 2012 ) . Biological virological analysis perform end first semester 2012 . Quantitative socio-behavioral data analyze third quarter 2012 . Results release begin year 2013 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objective characterize biological behavioral component might influence VL discordance blood semen . Background : In case semen VL reflect blood VL . However seropositive people undetectable blood VL detectable semen VL thus might risk HIV transmission case unprotected sexual behavior . Most previously publish study make rather small number HIV+ heterosexual men , cross-sectional address factor might associate discordant VL blood semen . Few study perform among seropositive MSM one at-risk population HIV . Issue : The work hypothesis virus present reservoir risky sexual behavior might influence discordance VL blood semen MSM . Our hypothesis rate might higher among MSM among general population due existence biological specific factor could lead HIV local replication . The main reason address question MSM ) data available population ; ii ) possibility measure population impact life style determinant semen VL ( high number sexual partner ; risky sexual behavior , multi-drugs consumption… ) ; iii ) strong expectation community new prevention strategy clear information HIV transmission risk . Outcomes : Quantitative data analysis allow u evaluate proportion people detectable semen VL , variation accord time . Socio-behavioral data analysis allow u describe sexual behavior might influence discordance VL blood semen HIV+ MSM . These result provide information HIV residual risk transmission treat MSM well target people might risk HIV transmission case unprotected sexual behavior . Describing socio-behavioral characteristic people help define adaptated intervention order improve HIV prevention MSM</detailed_description>
