	<brief_summary>False positive blood culture result due specimen contamination bacteria inhabit patient ' skin common problem emergency department ( EDs ) United States . Contaminated blood culture lead patient harm unnecessary hospitalization ED visit , delay surgery , unneeded antibiotic , unnecessary procedure . The investigator develop multifaceted quality improvement improvement bundle ( The Blood Culture QI Program ) design minimize blood culture contamination ED . In study , investigator implement quality improvement bundle six community hospital EDs evaluate effectiveness reduce contamination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Blood Culture Quality Improvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Blood Culture QI Program four component : ( 1 ) education : content knowledge standardize experiential training sterile technique design ED nurse ; ( 2 ) process redesign : change patient safety attitude conversion blood culture collection clean sterile technique ; ( 3 ) checklist use : reinforcement optimal blood culture collection technique point care ; ( 4 ) feedback : systematic chart report contamination rate ED nurse collect culture . In order convert blood culture collection fully sterile procedure , investigator develop Sterile Blood Culture Collection Kit , novel material kit contains equipment need collect culture use sterile technique , include : ( 1 ) 3ml solution 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate - 70 % isopropyl alcohol ( Chloraprep , CareFusion ) skin prep device ; ( 2 ) sterile drape ; ( 3 ) sterile needle ; ( 4 ) gauze . The investigator evaluate effectiveness Blood Culture QI Program implement six community hospital EDs . Our study compromise six replication interrupted time series study wherein replication power internal validity test hypothesis decrease contamination rate 50 % site . A stepped wedge ( also call multiple baseline ) design use implement program across hospital evaluate generalizability ( external validity ) program effectiveness . The primary analysis interrupt time series analysis site compare proportion ED blood culture contaminate post-implementation intervention period pre-intervention baseline period .</detailed_description>
