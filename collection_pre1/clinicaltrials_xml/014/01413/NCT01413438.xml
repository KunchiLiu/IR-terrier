	<brief_summary>Background : - Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common malignant brain tumor adult . Patients GBM usually treat surgery , radiation , chemotherapy . Despite treatment , GBMs start grow . Bevacizumab , chemotherapy drug , show promise slow growth GBMs . More research need find whether surgery start bevacizumab effective bevacizumab alone . Objectives : - To compare surgery plus bevacizumab bevacizumab alone adults glioblastoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year old whose glioblastoma come back treatment . Design : - All participant screen physical exam , medical history , blood test , image study . - Participants divide two group . One group surgery follow bevacizumab . The group drug without surgery . - The first group surgery soon possible begin bevacizumab 4 week surgery . The second group start drug soon possible . - Both group receive drug infusion every 2 week . They monitor frequent blood test image study . The infusion continue long drug effective prevent tumor regrowth . - Participants contact every 4 week stop take bevacizumab . They answer followup question either person telephone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The objective prospective randomize control study determine overall survival benefit tumor resection patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Study Population This study recruit 42 adult diagnosis recurrent grade 4 astrocytoma two arm , total 84 patient . All participant good candidate elective surgical resection tumor accord previously establish NIH Recurrent Glioma Scale ( NRGS ) , use performance status , tumor volume , tumor involvement critical/eloquent brain area prognostic criterion . Patients require biopsy previously treat bevacizumab exclude . Design Participants stratify NRGS score ( NRGS 0 NRGS 1-2 ) randomize surgery follow bevacizumab bevacizumab alone . Patients assign surgical arm undergo procedure within 28 day randomization . Treatment bevacizumab dose 10 mg/kg every 2 week begin least 28 day later allow adequate craniotomy wound heal . Patients assign non-surgical arm start bevacizumab dose 10 mg/kg every 2 week immediately . MRI evaluation take place within 72 hour surgery assess extent resection , 28 day postoperatively , 96 hour start bevacizumab , every 28 day tumor progression document . Follow-up assessment take place every 28 day bevacizumab tumor progression . Once progression establish , patient free pursue surgical and/or medical salvage therapy wish . Patients follow time death . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure median overall survival date bevacizumab start . Secondary outcome measure include rate progression-free survival 6 month start bevacizumab , median progression-free survival , overall survival rate 6 12 month start bevacizumab , objective response rate , health-related quality life , change KPS 20 point , time need additional tumor therapy , use corticosteroid .</detailed_description>
