	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective prospectively assess compare survival subject End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) randomize Peritoneal Dialysis ( PD ) Hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective prospectively assess compare follow parameter subject receive PD HD treatment : - Technique failure - Cause death - Comorbidity status baseline change throughout study - Change residual renal function ( RRF ) - Dialysis adequacy ( i.e. , Kt/Vurea ) - Change blood pressure , hemoglobin , S-phosphate - Change nutritional status - Occurrence bacterial infection - Hospitalization , include number , duration , underlie reason ( ) - Systemic inflammation assess high-sensitivity C reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) - Quality life ( QOL ) Safety Objectives : To compare nature frequency adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , include abnormal laboratory test finding clinical significance , subject receive PD HD treatment .</brief_summary>
