	<brief_summary>Background : - Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) genetic disorder prevents body make enough cholesterol . People SLOS often need take extra cholesterol , either food supplement , body work properly . Cholesterol important brain nervous system . Therefore SLOS highly related autism , mental retardation , brain nervous system disorder . Not much know people SLOS handle cholesterol take extra cholesterol help . A long-term study people SLOS help answer question . Objectives : - To study effect high-cholesterol diet people Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome . Eligibility : - Individuals age Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome . Design : - Participants study visit two time first year year every year . Each visit last 3 5 day . - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood urine test . - Participants provide regular blood , urine , stool , saliva , skin cell sample test . - Participants keep track food eat home . During study , eat high-cholesterol diet time , except second study visit ( 3 6 month screen visit ) . That visit involve cholesterol-free diet 4 week . - Participants special cholesterol test blood sample different time study . - At different study visit , participant test mental physical skill ( include test autism ) . They answer question diet food habit . They also hear eye test , body bone measurement , image study . Not test do every study . - Participants allow leave study time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study learn much possible Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome ( SLOS ) follow large group individual SLOS period time . We plan measure cholesterol sterol level , perform clinical observation , whole body test image study ( brain MRIs ) , learn disease mechanism progression , variation clinical feature among individual SLOS , evaluate effect cholesterol supplementation condition . Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) disorder cholesterol synthesis , production . It cause mutation DHCR7 gene encode 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase , enzyme necessary production cholesterol body . Affected individual exhibit multiple malformation mental retardation . The feature SLOS think primarily relate cholesterol deficiency accumulation cholesterol precursor . However , clinical phenotype well characterize , biochemical pathogenesis incompletely understood , proven therapy devastate condition . Thus primary objective good define clinical biochemical phenotype disease use natural history study design . The study contribute create comprehensive SLOS patient registry , identify biomarkers use diagnostic testing , screen outcome measure future therapeutic trial . All patient SLOS receive dietary cholesterol supplementation hope cholesterol supplementation improve clinical manifestation disease . However , evidence support clinical benefit cholesterol supplementation . Thus secondary objective study determine cholesterol intake correlate change whole body cholesterol homeostasis clinical end-points .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion child : The population study subject SLOS . Children exclude , fact , majority subject study infant child . Relatively adults SLOS known . We continue recruit subject age newborn adult gender . Inclusion woman : Women girls certainly include study . Women equally represent study . SLOS autosomal recessively inherited condition affect male female equally . However , since disorder uncommon autosomalrecessively inherit inborn error metabolism , STAIR investigator limit control gender mix study population . Inclusion Minorities : As mention gender , STAIR investigator limit control race ethnicity mix study population . In order increase enrollment minority subject , permission , inform national disease support group study subject region US ethnically racially diverse population may recruit . SLOS seem common Caucasians . In current SLOS study OHSU , one 34 SLOS subject Hispanic . There 1 report carrier Blacks ( Nowaczyk , 2001 ) 31 case report Japanese survey . In Oregon least , advertise study local community health clinic large number Hispanics see . EXCLUSION CRITERIA :</criteria>
