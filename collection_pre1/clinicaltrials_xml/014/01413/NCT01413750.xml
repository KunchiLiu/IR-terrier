	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give carboplatin paclitaxel together effective without vorinostat treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Vorinostat Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival associate combination carboplatin , paclitaxel vorinostat versus carboplatin , paclitaxel placebo patient previously untreated , advanced NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate , time treatment failure , overall survival two regimen . II . To assess safety profile regimen vorinostat , carboplatin paclitaxel patient advance NSCLC . III . To understand mechanistic aspect drug effect conduct correlative science study peripheral blood archive tumor tissue . An initial safety run-in study plan ( phase I ) start phase II randomize study describe . Doses Vorinostat test safety run-in portion : Dose Level -1 500 mg QD , Dose Level 1 600 mg QD , Dose Level 2 800 mg QD . Patients randomize safety lead-in period , patient treat lead-in consider primary evaluation arm comparison . Once safety run-in portion complete , patient randomize receive either placebo vorinostat fix dose determine run-in portion . Phase II Portion Study : OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 0 . Patients also receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily day -2 2 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Patients also receive placebo PO daily day -2 2 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , quarterly 1 year , twice year thereafter .</detailed_description>
