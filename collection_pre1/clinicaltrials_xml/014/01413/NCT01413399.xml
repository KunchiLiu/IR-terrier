	<brief_summary>The objective study assess frequency return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) , survival admission , survival discharge hospital , neurologic function time discharge hospital among patient experience hospital cardiac arrest randomize receive either intra-arrest induction therapeutic hypothermia ( IATH ) post-arrest therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) . Specific aim 1 . Develop test methodology randomize out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOHCA ) patient receive one two therapeutic hypothermia treatment prehospital environment . 2 . Randomize patient experience OOHCA receive either IATH post-arrest TH ass frequency ROSC , survival admission , survival discharge , neurologic function . 3 . Estimate efficacious volume chill saline administer intra arrest period . 4 . Identify barrier strategy successful implementation project multicenter randomize trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Intra-arrest Therapeutic Hypothermia Patients Suffering Non-Traumatic Out Hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic hypothermia improve mortality functional neurologic outcome patient resuscitate pulseless ventricular tachycardia fibrillation ( VT/VF ) , several study validate safety prehospital induction follow successful ( return spontaneous circulation ) ROSC rapid infusion 2 liter 4ยบC intravenous fluid . However , optimal timing induce hypothermia remain uncertain . Early study demonstrate efficacy therapeutic hypothermia despite delay 4 8 hour time ROSC initiation cooling . The post-resuscitation reperfusion injury evolves quickly think best attenuate hypothermia induction immediately follow return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) . This support animal data demonstrate improved neurologic outcome associate reduced time goal temperature follow ROSC . More recently hypothesis call question 2 clinical trial suggest time initiation cool associate improved neurologic outcome discharge . There may another benefit early therapeutic cooling . Animal data suggest intra-arrest induction therapeutic hypothermia ( IATH ) improve rate ROSC cardiac arrest . This corroborated report describe impressively high ROSC rate 60.9 % among patient receive IATH . This high frequency ROSC report similar patient group . It demonstrate mild hypothermia exerts stabilize effect myocardium , decrease rate refibrillation follow ROSC . Mild hypothermia also show prolong ventricular refractoriness repolarization , possibly facilitate electrical defibrillation slow repolarization ion current . Recently conduct retrospective observational study demonstrate association administration IATH ROSC.22 We find likelihood ROSC IATH 2.4 ( 95 % CI 1.41-4.24 ) time high subset patient receive &gt; 700ml 4ยบ C normal saline compare receive IATH . Our study lack sufficient power demonstrate difference survival admission discharge ; however , note trend towards improve survival . Current intra-arrest treatment obtain ROSC rate great see study IATH . These association note rhythm , include asystole pulseless electrical activity . Obtaining ROSC quickly result decrease time spend low flow circulation would obvious downstream effect hospital mortality neurologic function , independent effect mild hypothermia post-arrest inflammatory state . Surprisingly association see even fluid volume low change core body temperature suggest benefit therapeutic hypothermia myocardium may possible even relatively low fluid volume .</detailed_description>
