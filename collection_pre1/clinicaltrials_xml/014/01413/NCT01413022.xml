	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect optimal dose PF-04136309 give combination chemotherapy ( FOLFIRINOX ; 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ) treat patient locally advanced borderline resectable pancreatic cancer . These patient candidate surgical resection effective treatment pancreatic cancer . Giving PF-04136309 together FOLFIRINOX may shrink pancreatic tumor patient surgery become option</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FOLFIRINOX Plus PF-04136309 Patients With Borderline Resectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To define optimal dose toxicity PF-04136309 combination FOLFIRINOX ( fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin ) patient borderline resectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate safety PF-04136309 FOLFIRINOX grade 3 4 toxicity clinical use . - To determine tumor control rate ( TCR ) define stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) : TCR = SD + PR + CR . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : - To determine prevalence function myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) bone marrow , peripheral circulation , tumor treatment PF-04136309 FOLFIRINOX . - To determine prevalence function MDSC bone marrow , peripheral circulation , tumor treatment FOLFIRINOX .</detailed_description>
