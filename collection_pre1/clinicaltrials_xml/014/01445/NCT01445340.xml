	<brief_summary>Background : - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) rare , slow-growing form skin cancer . The cancer cell find red , scaly patch may sometimes itch . - Early-stage CTCL usually treat topical therapy , may lose effectiveness time adverse effect , risk secondary skin cancer difficulty use . - Romidepsin experimental drug , give vein , improve CTCL patient later stage disease . - A topical ointment form romidepsin may helpful treat early-stage CTCL . Objectives : - To determine high tolerate dose topical romidepsin give patient early-stage CTCL . - To evaluate effectiveness topical romidepsin patient early-stage CTCL . - To determine body handle topical romidepsin . Eligibility : -Patients 18 age old early-stage CTCL . Design : - Study Part 1 : Successive group 3 patient treat increasingly high concentration topical romidepsin high tolerate dose find . - Study Part II : The high tolerated dose , determine Part I , apply large area skin another group patient . - All study participant apply study medicine skin three time day 4 week . - During treatment , participant monitor week 2 4 history physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram , skin biopsy photograph skin . - After stop treatment , participant return clinic week 6 8 blood test see study medication affect body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Romidepsin histone deacetylase inhibitor demonstrate efficacy tolerability infusion later stag cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . - Early stage CTCL typically treat skin-directed therapy , may lose efficacy time adverse effect ( i.e . risk secondary skin cancer , difficulty use ) . - A topical form romidepsin may helpful treatment early-stage CTCL . Objectives : - Primary - To define maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) topical romidepsin early-stage CTCL administer three time weekly , escalate first concentration , follow increased frequency lastly increase body surface area . - Secondary - To assess histone acetylation topical romidepsin-treated skin . - Secondary - To assess pilot fashion clinical efficacy topical romidepsin early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . - Secondary - To perform pharmacokinetic monitoring blood level romidepsin topically treat patient . Eligibility : -Patients age great equal 18 confirm early-stage ( stage IA , IB , IIA ) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Design : - A Cohorts Three design define MTD topical romidepsin Aquaphor ointment initially apply overnight , three time weekly 4 week , escalate first concentration , follow increased frequency lastly increase body surface area . - Skin toxicity , systemic toxicity , disease response assess throughout study . - The primary focus first part protocol evaluate local skin toxicity , begin dose level 1 0.05 percent topical romidepsin 25 cm ( 2 ) target area ( 0.005 mg/ cm ( 2 ) . If tolerate , progress high dose level 0.25 percent ( 0.025 mg/ cm ( 2 ) ; dose level 2 ) 0.5 percent ( 0.05 mg/ cm ( 2 ) ; dose level 3 ) topical romidepsin 25 cm ( 2 ) target area . Systemic toxicity also monitor . - To date , complete first 4 dose level yet establish cutaneous MTD . To achieve , proceed second part protocol , increase concentration 1 % , increase frequency daily application , progress 2 % concentration , 4 % concentration , apply progressively large body surface area . Our aim fully address systemic toxicity increase drug concentration , application frequency , body surface area ( BSA ) treat . We utilize topical romidepsin MTD increase BSA ( lesional &amp; nonlesional skin ) : multiple lesion 3 % BSA ( dose level 4 ) , multiple lesion 25 % BSA ( dose level 7A ) , 50 % BSA ( dose level 7B ) , 75 % &gt; BSA ( dose level 7C ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must pathologically confirm diagnosis CTCL base skin biopsy , utilize standard histological criterion base cytological , architectural , immunophenotypic finding . In case equivocal histological feature , diagnosis may verify confirm use clonal Tcell gamma gene rearrangement , detect PCR amplification primer set specific Tcell receptor gamma chain gene . 2 . Patients must early stage CTCL ( Stage IA , IB , IIA define TNM stag system ) . 3 . Patients must : 1. age great equal 18 year . 2. evaluable disease . 3. performance status ECOG 01 . 4. either therapy topical therapy early stage CTCL . Patients must stop light therapy ( i.e . PUVA , UVB ) least 2 week prior use study medication . Patients must stop topical therapy ( i.e . corticosteroid nitrogen mustard ) designate target site area treat study medication least 2 week prior use study medication . ( Topical therapy CTCL may continue nonadjacent , nontarget lesion protocol . ) Patients may receive HDACI therapy must stop systemic therapy 4 week prior use study medication . 5. able give write informed consent . 6. willing return National Cancer Institute followup . 4 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . The effect romidepsin develop human fetus unknown . For reason HDAC Inhibitor agent know teratogenic , patient pregnant lactate exclude trial . 5 . Laboratory value : Within 7 day prior registration : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1000/microL , platelet great equal 100,000/microL , bilirubin ( total direct ) less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal , AST le equal 3 time upper limit normal , creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal , documented creatinine clearance great equal 60mL/min 6 . Cardiac finding : Within 4 week registration : ECG [ patient QTc prolongation ( great 480 msec ) and/or rhythm abnormality ; allowance EKG change discretion investigator base consultation cardiologist ] echocardiogram [ demonstrate normal ejection fraction ] . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Prior concurrent malignancy curatively treat exception malignancy curatively treat without recurrence precede 5 year , nonmelanoma skin cancer , low grade cervical cancer prostate cancer . 2 . Current previous CNS metastasis . 3 . Chemotherapy within 4 week , 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 8 week UCN01 . 4 . HIV seropositivity . 5 . Pregnant breastfeeding patient . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 .
