	<brief_title>Analysis Data Collected From Individuals Administered Neurobehavioral Assessments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Individuals chronic illness often risk develop neurobehavioral impairment due effect disease and/or associate treatment . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Neurobehavioral Group collect neurobehavioral data obtain longitudinal psychometric test infant , child , adolescent , adult various chronic illness enrol IRB-approved protocol NIH since 1980 , many close . In addition , continue collect neurobehavioral data obtain assessment individual enrol current IRB-approved protocol . The neurobehavioral test data evaluation , well demographic information , medical value , neurologic finding , neuroimaging abnormality , store neuropsychological database currently locate secure NIH mainframe computer system . Investigating neurobehavioral function child chronic illness important identify monitoring effect disease treatment time , determine possible at-risk subgroup , evaluate response therapy , recommend educational rehabilitative intervention . In addition , data may use compare various aspect neurobehavioral functioning among different illness group healthy control , validate novel methodology well assess select domain function , pediatric quality life ( QOL ) scale child chronic illness CNS involvement . Objectives : To describe neurobehavioral functioning individual chronic illness base analysis store data collect IRB-approved protocol , consist retrospective data collect protocol close data collect prospectively current future protocol . Eligibility : Data obtain infant , child , adolescent , adult administer neurobehavioral assessment part past , current , future IRB-approved protocol . Design : No data collect specifically protocol . Retrospective data previously collect individual receive neurobehavioral assessment part past IRB-approved protocol prospective data already collect specify current future IRB-approved protocol store secure NCI Neurobehavioral database use data analysis outline protocol . Cross-sectional longitudinal data select database statistical analysis base objective study . Since different objective may study use various type data , variety statistical analysis conduct examine store data depend objective study .</detailed_description>
