	<brief_summary>This study analyze effect radiation give child tumor central nervous system ( CNS ) . Researchers want learn change quality life patient may experience result radiation . Patients age 21 young primary CNS tumor receive radiation previously may eligible study . They medical history physical examination . Collection blood ( 2-1/2 tablespoon ) urine do , well pregnancy test . Patients complete neuropsychological test , provide information change function time . An expert psychology give number test , patient 's parent guardian ask complete questionnaire patient 's behavior . Also , patient give quality life questionnaire complete vision hearing test . The radiation prescribe patient ' doctor part study . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) give researcher information tumor brain , several scan sequence . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . Patients lie table slide enclose tunnel scanner . They need lie still , medication may give help . They may scanner 2 hour . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . A contrast agent administer , allow image see clearly . Blood urine test conduct first dose radiation . MRI scan do 2 week patient finish radiation therapy 6 8 week , 6 month , 12 month , yearly . Also follow-up period , patient undergo similar procedure previously , include blood urine test neuropsychological test . Patients remain study 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Effects Radiation Therapy Pediatric Patients With Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : This exploratory study perform pediatric patient CNS tumor undergo radiation therapy investigate pathophysiologic effect radiation CNS . The study include analysis blood , urine , CSF ( available ) measure biological marker involve angiogenesis , blood : brain barrier integrity , neurotoxicity . It also entail comprehensive MR image technique neuropsychological test effort correlate change biomarker measurement . Objectives : 1 . To detect change angiogenesis relate radiation CNS : - Measurement VEGF , bFGF , thrombospondin , TNF-alpha , IL-12 , IL-8 , MMP blood urine specimen . - MR perfusion DEMRI . 2 . To describe change blood : brain barrier permeability associate radiation CNS . 3 . To characterize neurotoxicity : - Measuring biomarkers associate neurotoxicity - Documenting change neurobehavioral function longitudinal comprehensive assessment - Describing change quality life ( QOL ) - Assessing change memory - Defining change ophthalmologic study associate radiation . - Detecting change audiometry associate radiation . Eligibility Criteria : - Patients must primary CNS tumor radiation therapy recommend . - Patients must less equal 21 year age . - Prior/Concurrent : Patients eligible receive prior radiation . Patients undergone surgery receive chemotherapy eligible . - Performance Status : Patients eligible regardless performance score . Design : This minimally invasive study design explore various biologic effect radiation pediatric CNS attempt 1 ) obtain information pathophysiology radiation-induced damage , 2 ) explore association neuropsychological deficit biologic marker neuroimaging abnormality , 3 ) document change neurobehavioral function longitudinal comprehensive neuropsychological assessment comparison various radiation therapy technique , 4 ) describe change quality life pediatric patient receive radiation therapy , 5 ) attempt identify child increase risk radiation-induced neurotoxicity .</detailed_description>
