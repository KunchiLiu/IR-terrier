	<brief_summary>Background : - Cyclophosphamide ( CP ) drug approve Food Drug Administration treatment certain cancer . It work cause DNA damage , result cell death , include cancer cell . - ABT-888 experimental drug give small number patient . It work prevent DNA repair tumor cell . Objectives : - To test safety combination ABT-888 CP , determine dose drug give together patient cancer . - To see body handle ABT-888 give together CP - To evaluate anti-tumor response drug combination . Eligibility : - Adults solid tumor lymphoid cancer ( lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) whose disease respond standard treatment . Design : - Patients take ABT-888 mouth day 7 , 14 21 day , depend dose level assign individual patient . - Patients take CP mouth day every day 21-day cycle . ( Some patient take CP 14 day . ) - Patients undergo test procedure periodically study , include : - Clinic visit physical examination begin cycle - Blood urine test , electrocardiogram , measurement vital sign - CT scan , MRI scan ultrasound test check response tumor treatment - Tumor biopsy ( optional ) - Bone marrow aspiration biopsy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABT-888 Plus Metronomic Cyclophosphamide Treat Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) family enzymes characterized ability poly-ADP-ribosylate protein substrate . PARP-1 PARP-2 play critical role maintenance genomic stability regulate variety DNA repair mechanism . - PARP activity show important base excision repair pathway . The inhibition PARP could inhibit repair DNA damage cause alkylating agent cyclophosphamide . ABT-888 show potentiate action cyclophosphamide xenograft model . ABT-888 orally deliver PARP inhibitor cyclophosphamide deliver orally alkylating agent . - Metronomic therapy cyclophosphamide demonstrate efficacy multiple tumor type include , limited , ovarian cancer , lymphoma , prostate cancer , breast cancer . Its activity least partially attributed mediation anti-angiogenic effect induction apoptosis endothelial cell . Objectives : - Establish safety tolerability combination ABT-888 metronomic cyclophosphamide patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas . - Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination ABT-888 metronomic cyclophosphamide . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics ABT-888 administered combination cyclophosphamide . - Evaluate anti-tumor response . - Determine effect study treatment level PARP inhibition gamma-H2AX PBMCs tumor sample . Eligibility : - Patients histologically document solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) whose disease progress follow standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . - No major surgery , radiation chemotherapy within four week prior study enrollment , recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . Study Design : - ABT-888 administer orally daily 7 21 day , depend dose level ( see ) . Cyclophosphamide administer orally daily 50 mg 100 mg dos continuously day 1 21 . Cycle length 21 day . - Dose escalation proceed outline . Once MTD establish , 6 additional patient enrol MTD evaluate dose extend PD study dose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologically document solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) refractory standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . Patients lymphoid malignancy eligible disease progress follow standard therapy stem cell transplantation indicate refused . Any prior therapy must complete great equal 4 week ( great 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enrollment protocol , participant must recover eligibility level ( CTCAE Grade less equal 1 ) prior toxicity . Prior radiation complete great equal 4 week prior study enrollment , associate toxicity resolve eligibility level . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study , recover eligibility level toxicity . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ABT888 patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % , see Appendix A . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL ( mcL ) platelets great equal 100,000/microL ( mcL ) total bilirubin le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min patient creatinine level 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal . The effect ABT888 develop human fetus unknown . For reason cyclophosphamide hydrochloride use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence ; female use hormonal method , barrier method birth control ; male use condom ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Because risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother cyclophosphamide , breastfeed discontinue patient trial 30 day completion treatment trial . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study , recover eligibility level toxicity . Patients administer ABT888 part single limit dose study , Phase 0 study , exclude participate study solely receive prior ABT888 . Patients receive prior cyclophosphamide exclude solely receive prior cyclophosphamide . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients gliomas , symptomatic CNS metastases carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial . Patients history CNS metastases receive treatment whose CNS metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 3 month without steroid antiseizure medication may eligible . These patient may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients history seizure . Patients HIV take protease inhibitor . Patients gastrointestinal condition might predispose drug intolerability poor drug absorption ( e.g. , inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , malabsorption syndrome , active peptic ulcer disease ) exclude . Subjects ulcerative colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , partial complete small bowel obstruction also exclude .</criteria>
