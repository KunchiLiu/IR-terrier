	<brief_title>Rapid Diagnostic Test Detection Group B Streptococcus Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrapartum infection group B streptococci ( GBS ) may lead untoward neonatal sequela pneumonia , septicemia , meningitis . Several clinical trial demonstrate use intrapartum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis ( penicillin agent choice due narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity ) highly effective prevent early-onset neonatal GBS infection . It estimate 10 % 30 % pregnant woman GBS carrier , likely GBS colonize virtually every female point . Consensus guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) , American Academy Pediatrics , recommend prenatal screen 35 37 week gestation chemoprophylaxis delivery base upon culture result . The CDC-recommended method detect GBS colonization involve collect combine vaginal rectal specimen culture organism selective broth medium , follow subculturing onto blood agar plate . However , traditional method culture take 72 hour result available . With 12.8 % patient experience preterm delivery prior GBS screen occurs , 15 % term pregnancy routine GBS screening perform , significant portion woman present unknown GBS status time potential delivery . These clinical situation require obstetrician utilize risk-based strategy show half effective culture-based screening . Thus , need exist rapid detection method GBS . Recent research focus polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) base method detection GBS . Sensitivity detection GBS PCR assay range 87 % 91 % . These method limit high cost , inability perform antibiotic sensitivity GBS ( woman penicillin allergy ) . New technology , call bionanopore ( BNP ) bionanofilter ( BNF ) rapid , microbial detection system utilizes sandwiched-membrane petri technology . These advantage detect GBS le 6 hour , less cost , potential allow antibiotic sensitivity perform .</detailed_description>
