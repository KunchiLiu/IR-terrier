	<brief_title>Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) Treat Children With Solid Tumors Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The ras gene product play critical role cell signal transduction . Activating Ras mutation occur 30 % human cancer , ra pathway may upregulated absence ra mutation . Activated Ras initiate several signal cascade , best characterize Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade . Ras initiate pathway recruit Raf kinase plasma membrane modify full activation . A high frequency B-Raf mutation recently report variety adult solid cancer . Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) novel , orally bioavailable , bi-aryl urea , potently inhibit wild type mutant raf . In addition , sorafenib inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases include human VEGFR-2 , FLT3 , c-KIT , p38 alpha , suggest sorafenib may mediate anti-tumor activity via several additional mechanism . In early adult clinical trial sorafenib well tolerate , minimal myelosuppression . Dose-limiting toxicity hand-foot syndrome , diarrhea , fatigue , hypertension , pain , rash . Responses sorafenib observe early clinical trial adult variety tumor , include tumor describe harbor raf mutation . Sorafenib recently approve Food Drug Administration treatment refractory renal cell cancer . OBJECTIVES : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral Sorafenib child refractory solid tumor refractory leukemia . To define toxicity pharmacokinetics Sorafenib . To evaluate tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics activity sorafenib administer MTD refractory leukemia patient AML FLT3-ITD mutation ELIGIBILITY : Patients ( great equal 24 month less equal 21 year ) refractory solid tumor refractory leukemia . Patients ( great equal 24 month less equal 21 year ) AML FLT3-ITD mutation ( Part C ) . Participation pharmacokinetic sample mandatory Part C. DESIGN : Sorafenib administer orally BID continuous dose schedule ( 28 day = 1 treatment cycle ) . Dose escalation perform define MTD . Initially , spectrum toxicity MTD define patient solid tumor . Patients refractory leukemias enter solid tumor MTD , determine whether patient leukemia tolerate dose level . Pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , pharmacogenetics sorafenib studied patient solid tumor leukemias . In Part C : 14 patient receive sorafenib 150 mg/m ( 2 ) /dose , BID evaluate tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics activity sorafenib .</detailed_description>
