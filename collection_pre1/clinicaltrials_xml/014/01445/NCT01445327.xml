	<brief_summary>Background : - Gastrointestinal cancer among commonly diagnose cancer United States . - There currently test predict patient gastrointestinal cancer respond radiation therapy patient may develop side effect treatment . - Studies tumor cell stool , urine , blood patient may provide valuable information use develop test determine patient may need less aggressive therapy . - Studies substances stool , urine , blood patient may provide valuable information use develop test determine patient likely develop side effect radiation treatment . Objectives : - To collect blood , urine stool specimens patient gastrointestinal cancer undergo radiation therapy . - To study hormone protein change blood , urine stool specimen , radiation treatment order develop way predict gastrointestinal cancer respond radiation therapy patient cancer develop side effect radiation treatment . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old cancer gastrointestinal tract ( esophagus , stomach , pancreas , rectum ) plan receive radiotherapy site cancer NCI protocol Design : Participants undergo follow procedure : - Tumor biopsy : Before treatment time surgery first treatment - Urine collection : Before , , treatment follow-up visit . - Stool collection : Before , , treatment follow-up visit . - Blood collection : Before , , treatment follow-up visit . - Intestinal permeability assessment : Before treatment , radiation ( radiation first treatment ) , 1 month radiation complete , 3 month radiation complete . This test determine patient intestine work absorb sugar may provide information side effect radiation treatment . Patients fast midnight , drink small glass sugar , 6-hour urine collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Gastrointestinal ( GI ) carcinomas represent one commonly diagnosed malignancy United States . - A sensitive specific marker tumor persistence recurrence would permit accurate determination appropriateness adjuvant therapy patient clinical evidence disease follow curative resection allow diagnosis recurrence earlier stage may amenable curative salvage therapy . - A biomarker detectable shortly treatment early stage chronic radiation toxicity may allow identification patient risk early intervention . Objectives : - Our primary objective determine patient specific tumor marker stool , urine , serum reliably detect prior treatment follow treatment monitor extent residual disease . - A second objective evaluate predictive value potential marker chronic gastrointestinal injury radiotherapy . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year - Histologically confirm carcinoma gastrointestinal tract ( esophagus , stomach , pancreas , rectum ) - Planned receive radiotherapy site gastrointestinal malignancy NCI protocol Design : - This protocol provide mean acquire tissue , serum , urine , stool sample patient receive radiation therapy part treatment gastrointestinal malignancy . - Patients treat radiation therapy NCI treatment protocol ask provide sample prior local systemic therapy well , radiation treatment . - These sample test presence tumor specific DNA mutation aberrant methylation pattern determine present patient tumor screen initial biopsy surgical material . - Tumor marker specific patient , tumor specific DNA mutation aberrant DNA methylation , may provide individualized method evaluate disease status determine prognosis therapy . Additionally , number stool serum marker explore early indicator acute eventual chronic gastrointestinal injury patient receive radiotherapy abdomen .</detailed_description>
