	<brief_title>A Study GSK2110183 Subjects With Proteasome Inhibitor Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , open-label , Phase Ib/II study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , efficacy oral AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 administer subject proteasome inhibitor refractory MM . During Part 1 study , dose escalation follow 3 + 3 dose escalation procedure start initial dose regimen 125 mg GSK2110183 escalate next dose level increase GSK2110183 le equal 50 % DLTs certain level describe protocol . Subjects receive single dose GSK2110183 Day -3 Cycle 0 , follow PK sample next 72 hour . Cycle 1 may commence time ( within 7 day ) collection 72 hour Cycle 0 PK sample . GSK2110183 administer subject sequential PK Cohorts continuous daily dose schedule 21 day cycle one Treatment Discontinuation Criteria meet . Sparse PK sample also collect first 8 cycle . Urine PK sample collect prior first dose GSK2110183 24-hour urine collection steady-state . The PK Cohorts characterize pharmacokinetics GSK2110183 plasma urine , well determine RP2D GSK2110183 . The RP2D dose provide adequate PK exposure biologic activity without exceed MTD MM subject define current study . GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy give subject progress GSK2110183 monotherapy PK Cohorts . Following completion PK sample PK Cohorts determination RP2D GSK2110183 , Part 2 study commence RP2D . Part 2 study evaluate R2PD use flexible 2-stage design stopping rule allow early termination base lack efficacy end Stage 1 . GSK2110183 administer continuous daily dose schedule 21-day cycle one Treatment Discontinuation Criteria meet . Twenty subject enrol Stage 1 , subject responds , study stop ; otherwise , study continue enroll additional 20 subject Stage 2 . At end Stage 2 , 4 few 40 subject respond , study deem success monotherapy . Those subject meet criterion progression Part 2 [ define 2011 Report International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 1 ] , also meet additional eligibility criterion salvage therapy may proceed GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy . GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy continue one Treatment Discontinuation Criteria meet . Exploratory PK/PD analyse may perform Part 1 Part 2 examine potential relationship GSK2110183 pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamic biomarkers ( e.g. , pAKT , pPRAS40 bone marrow ) , marker disease activity serum ( e.g. , beta-2 microglobulin , C-reactive protein ) , blood-based cytokine angiogenesis factor ( e.g. , IL-6 , VEGF ) . A secondary objective study determine whether addition bortezomib GSK2110183 clinical activity patient refractory proteasome inhibitor therapy progress single-agent GSK2110183 therapy .</detailed_description>
