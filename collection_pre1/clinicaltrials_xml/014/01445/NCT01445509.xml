	<brief_summary>Background : - Bevacizumab inhibit blood vessel growth cancer cell block growth factor call VEGF . Dasatinib inhibit action protein call tyrosine kinase , promote stimulate blood vessel formation cancer growth spread . - Using two drug combination may provide effective cancer treatment either drug use alone . - Both drug approve Food Drug Administration different cancer type , use combination si experimental . Objectives : - To determine high dos combination dasatinib bevacizumab safely give patient different cancer find effect , good bad , drug may patient disease . Eligibility : - Adult patient advance solid tumor cancer treat successfully standard therapy . Design : - Patients Group 1 receive dasatinib bevacizumab together throughout study . The dose increase successive group three six patient optimum safe dose determine . Patients take dasatinib mouth day receive bevacizumab infusion vein every 2 week 28-day treatment cycle . - Patients Group 2 randomly assign receive either dasatinib bevacizumab cycle one , drug subsequent cycle . The drug dos base optimum dos find Group 1 patient . - Patients physical examination blood urine test every 2 week cycle 1 2 , every 4 week duration treatment . - Patients CT MRI scan another image test ultrasound every 8 week monitor cancer response treatment . - Tumor biopsy obtain patient Group 2 treatment , 2 week first treatment cycle , 2 week second cycle . - Dynamic , contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) test do patient Group 2 treatment , 2 week first cycle 4 week second cycle . This MRI test use special non-radioactive dye show blood flow certain part body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combination With Bevacizumab Treat Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Dasatinib inhibitor SRC family kinase , BCR-ABL , c-KIT , EPHA2 PDGF beta receptor . Bevacizumab humanize IgG1 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) bind biologically active isoforms human vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF , VEGF-A ) high affinity ( k ( ) equal 1.1nM ) . This Phase I trial open patient solid tumor . Objectives : Determine safety toxicity combination dasatinib bevacizumab . Determine biochemical change src-FAK src-PLC- . VEGF signal transduction pathway tumor stromal cell response treatment MTD , pilot fashion , change statistically significant . Eligibility : Adults histologically document solid tumor malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative therapy exist longer effective . Patients must prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy least 4 week . All patient enrol Group 2 must least one lesion amenable biopsy . ECOG performance status 0 1 adequate organ marrow function . Design : Group 1 receive dasatinib bevacizumab together start study dose escalation fashion . Group 2 randomize agent receive cycle one . Cycles 2 beyond treat use agent . Tumor biopsy obtain patient Group 2 treatment , two week mono-therapy , two week combinatorial therapy . DCE-MRI study obtain patient Group 2 treatment , two week monotherapy , four week monotherapy , two week combinatorial therapy . Patients evaluated toxicity clinic every 2 week Cycles 1 2 , every 4 week . Patients evaluate response every 8 week use RECIST criterion . Approximately 48 patient need achieve objective trial .</detailed_description>
