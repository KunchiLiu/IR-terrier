	<brief_summary>This study examine safety efficacy ipilimumab-an experimental cancer treatment drug use boost immune response-in child , adolescent , young adult . Ipilimumab may allow immune cell react destroy abnormal cell body , test adult variety cancer show response research study . Because ipilimumab test child , adolescent , young adult , consider experimental drug . The purpose research study determine high safe dose ipilimumab child , adolescent , young adult solid tumor cancer ; examine effectiveness possible side effect ; good understand body immune system process time . Candidates must 2 21 year age must solid malignant tumor resistant standard therapy . Volunteers screen medical history , clinical examination , computerized scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Participants must complete last dose chemotherapy , radiation , chemotherapy , antibody investigational therapy least four week prior enrollment . During study , participant receive intravenous dose ipilimumab every three week . The infusion ipilimumab last 90 minute , participant vital sign monitor medicine infuse several time first 24 hour first dose ( require hospital stay time ) . If participant able tolerate first dose ipilimumab , dos ( call cycle ) may receive outpatient basis . Blood urine test give regular basis cycle . After four cycle , participant whose tumor grow unacceptable side effect continue receive ipilimumab every three month maintain current condition , researcher conclude study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Ipilimumab ( Anti-CTLA-4 ) Children Adolescents With Treatment-Resistant Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Solid tumor represent approximately one fourth cancer diagnose child . Despite intensive regimen , patient metastatic recurrent solid tumor unsatisfactory survival rate . Therefore new therapy need improve outcome . Accumulating preclinical clinical evidence support use biologic approach heighten antitumor immunity order improve effectiveness immune base therapy . Both directly activate immune base therapy cytokine tumor vaccine well therapy disrupt negative counterregulatory signal mediate CTLA-4 : B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune response . Antibodies direct CTLA-4 potently augment immune response animal model anti-CTLA-4 antibody demonstrate antitumor effect variety preclinical tumor model . Phase I phase II study use ipilimumab perform adult variety tumor type . Clinical response observe renal cell carcinoma , melanoma , prostate cancer . No trial yet perform evaluate ipilimumab child malignancy . Objectives : To determine tolerance toxicity profile ipilimumab range dos , exceed , high dose tolerate adult , patient less equal 21 year age refractory solid tumor . To assess pharmacokinetics ipilimumab administer intravenously patient less equal 21 year age advance and/or refractory solid tumor . Eligibility : Patients must 1-21 year age time enrollment solid malignant tumor refractory standard therapy . Design : A Phase I dose find study 4 plan dose level . Three patient enrol dose level expand cohort 12 high maximum torlerated dose intent include 6 patient &lt; 12 year . Re-induction 4 infusion ipilimumab assign dose follow another maintenance phase possible subject progress maintenance therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : AGE : Patients must great equal 1 year less equal 21 year age . DIAGNOSIS : Histologically confirm solid tumor , may include limited rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor , osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma , Wilm tumor , Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients melanoma eligible . Patients previous history CNS metastases eligible metastasis treat surgery and/or radiotherapy , clinically stable evidenced requirement corticosteroid , patient evolve neurologic deficit progression residual brain abnormality without specific therapy 4 week . MEASURABLE/EVALUABLE DISEASE : Patients must measurable evaluable tumor . PRIOR THERAPY : The patient cancer must relapse follow failed respond standard therapy and/or patient current disease state must one know curative therapy therapy proven prolong survival . Patients must complete last dose irradiation , chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody , investigational therapy least 4 week prior enrollment . For patient undergone autologous stem cell transplantation , least 3 month must elapse since transplant . Patients must recover toxic effect ( grade 1 less ) prior therapy prior enrollment , exception following : Hematological toxicity : recovery level require Low electrolyte level ( Such individual receive appropriate supplementation ) For patient anticoagulant therapy preexist coagulation abnormality , PT , PTT must return baseline . Liver function test must resolve value require Grade 3 hypoalbuminemia Alopecia Sterility PERFORMANCE STATUS : Patients great 10 year old must Karnofsky Score great equal 50 child less 10 year old must Lansky score great 50 . Patients unable walk paralysis weakness , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION : Patients must adequate bone marrow function , define peripheral absolute granulocyte count great equal 1000/microL , hemoglobin great equal 8 gm/dl , platelet count great equal 50,000/microL ( may correct transfusion ) . HEPATIC FUNCTION : Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , less equal 2.5fold upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Normal total bilirubin . RENAL FUNCTION : Patients must normal ageadjusted serum creatinine ( see table ) OR creatinine clearance great equal 70 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) . MAXIMUM SERUM CREATININE LEVEL FOR AGE : For child whose age less equal 5 year , 0.8 mg/dL For child whose age great 5 less equal 10 , 1.0 mg/dL For child whose age great 10 less equal 15 , 1.2 mg/dL For child whose age great 15 , 1.5 mg/dL INFECTIOUS DISEASE : A patient viral hepatitis ( HBV , HCV ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) exclude trial limit confound variable assessment potential hepatic toxicity ipilimumab uncertain impact ipilimumab administration viral replication . Serology required unless infection clinically suspect . A positive hepatitis B titer exclude patient immunization perform history disease . INFORMED CONSENT : All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year old ) must sign document inform consent ( Pediatric Oncology Branch , NCI screen protocol NIH patient ) prior perform study determine patient eligibility . After confirmation eligibility , patient legal guardian must voluntarily sign IRB approve protocol specific inform consent document understand investigational nature , risk study willingness receive therapy undergo research study involve include pharmacokinetic study . The consent must sign protocol related study perform ( This include routine laboratory test image study require establish eligibility ) . When appropriate , pediatric patient include discussion order obtain verbal assent . DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY ( DPA ) : Patients great equal 18 year age offer opportunity assign DPA another person make decision medical care become incapacitated cognitively impaired . BIRTH CONTROL : Patients childbearing childfathering potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control include abstinence , treat study 60 day follow last dose . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day prior initiation study therapy prior additional dose ipilimumab . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Primary brain tumor Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection organ dysfunction , judgment Principal Associate Investigators would compromise patient ability tolerate agent trial likely interfere study procedure result . This include limited : Criticallyill medically unstable patient Patients active infection significant systemic illness Patients active diarrhea Patients active eye inflammation , uveitis Presence symptomatic pleural effusion Patients symptoms congestive heart failure uncontrolled cardiac rhythm disturbance History malignant hyperthermia Concurrent history autoimmune disease exclude stable asthma Positive direct Coombs test history hemolytic anemia Patients history ongoing intermittent bowel obstruction Concurrent radiation Patients history allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Untreated CNS metastasis render patient ineligible however patient previous history CNS metastases eligible : metastasis treat surgery and/or radiotherapy , clinically stable evidenced requirement corticosteroid , patient evolve neurologic deficit progression residual brain abnormality without specific therapy eligible one week post radiation radiosurgery . Patients asymptomatic subcentemeric CNS lesion eligible trial immediate radiation surgery . Patients history previous therapy ipilimumab exclude study participation .
