	<brief_summary>The useful method manage pain major ankle surgery infusion local analgesic catheter close sciatic nerve . Sensation ankle carry three nerve : The tibial peroneal nerve ( unified sciatic nerve ) saphenous nerve . Study purpose test whether continuous infusion local analgesic saphenous nerve catheter provide good treatment pain comparison single injection nerve block . In addition cost-effectiveness two method compare . The 50 patient trial randomize cluster ten . We intend preliminary analysis data first 40 patient . However , interim analysis . Fifty patient include independent result preliminary analysis . The random allocation last 10 patient also double-blinded .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saphenous Nerve Block : Single Shot Versus Continuous Infusion Supplement Continuous Sciatic Nerve Block After Major Ankle Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major ankle surgery know painful first 48 hour operation due surgical oedema . This pain difficult control systemic analgesic . Pain relief systemic analgesic require high dos intravenous opioids associate breakthrough pain adverse effect opioids ( sedation , nausea , vomit , obstipation , urinary retention , respiratory depression ) . Continuous , peripheral nerve block catheter technique two day minimizes need systemic analgesic . Today continuous sciatic nerve block part standard pain treatment major ankle surgery Aarhus University Hospital . Despite accurate placement catheter many patient great pain saphenous nerve remain unaffected . A single injection block relieve pain block Ropivacaine last 8-15 hour . Severe postoperative pain lead high opioid dosage , cognitive blurring , nausea , vomiting , reduce ambulation , increase surgical stress response increase morbidity . Pain problem adverse effect prolongs postoperative observation time maybe also time discharge . The aim study establish whether continuous saphenous nerve block efficient ( pain relief reduce opioid consumption ) justify ( cost-effectiveness analysis ) compare single injection block .</detailed_description>
