	<brief_summary>Background : - There standardized set test measure change neuropsychological functioning patient treat brain metastasis ( cancer spread beyond original site brain ) . - Neuropsychological function important effect quality life include determine treatment option . Objectives : - To find change patient cognitive ( think ) daily function standard radiation treatment brain metastasis measure test . - To see change test relate patient response radiation therapy . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old cancer spread brain . Design : - Patients receive 2-week course radiation therapy brain , give daily 5 day week . Some patient may require stereotactic radiosurgery ( additional boost radiation therapy specific sit brain metastasis ) . - Patients follow evaluation treatment determine change cognition functioning : - Neuropsychological testing measure cognitive ( think ) ability like memory , attention , process speed , reading , fine motor skill . - Questionnaires assess quality life daily live skill . - Patients MRI scan blood urine test . - At completion radiation treatment , patient return clinic follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 12 month blood urine test , physical examination , MRI brain , neuropsychological test assessment quality life daily live skill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropsychological Changes Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Metastatic brain tumor occur frequently primary brain tumor occur approximately 25 percent patient die cancer year . - The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) develop three prognostic class use recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) large database . Theses class base Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) , age disease status . - The RTOG RPA class include neuropsychological function measure outcome . - There consensus standardization test selection measure change neuropsychological functioning patient population . - Neuropsychological function important effect quality life include determine prognosis treatment option patient . - Neuropsychological functioning important determine effect treatment measure outcomes clinical trial . Objectives : - To identify neuropsychological test score detect significant change neuropsychological functioning patient receive radiation therapy brain metastasis . - To examine relationship neuropsychological function survival patient receive radiation therapy brain metastasis . Eligibility : - Patients age 18 year old . - Pathologically confirm primary malignancy least one intraparenchymal brain metastasis identify brain MRI scan intravenous contrast . - The patient must communicate English order complete neuropsychological evaluation . Design : - This longitudinal study administer serial neuropsychological assessment patient brain metastasis receive radiation therapy . - Patients undergo battery neuropsychological test prior radiotherapy ( WBRT WBRT follow SRS ) , radiation one month post-baseline ( 2 week radiation therapy ) , 3 , 6 month , every 3 month 12 month baseline . - The test battery involve approximately 40 minute direct cognitive test 15 minute questionnaire . There three cohort 20 patient total 60 patient . The three cohort make differ histology sort basis RTOG RPA Class .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must 18 year age old . 2 . Pathologically confirmed primary malignancy least one intraparenchymal brain metastasis identify brain MRI scan intravenous contrast . Cohort 1 ( N=20 ) : KPS great 70 ; Age less equal 65 ; control primary tumor extracranial metastasis . Cohort 2 ( N=20 ) : KPS great 70 least one following : age great 65 , uncontrolled synchronous primary disease , extracranial metastasis Cohort 3 ( N=20 ) : KPS le 70 3 . Patient must primary medical surgical oncologist community NCI willing collaborate ROB staff clinical management patient . 4 . All patient must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study BEFORE protocol relate study preform ( include routine laboratory test image study require establish eligibility ) . 5 . Subjects childbearing child father potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Cognitively impaired patient give informed consent , include patient assigned power attorney medical decision . 2 . Inability communicate English language . 3 . Pre exist active psychiatric neurologic impairment , cause brain metastasis , , opinion investigator , interfere proper administration completion protocol . 4 . Prior Therapy Patients must treat previous brain metastasis . Patients must previous cranial radiation . Patients must undergo treatment investigational drug primary disease within 7 day baseline neuropsychological testing . Patients must receive systemic therapy within 7 day prior baseline neuropsychological testing . Patients surgery current brain metastasis must wait least 7 day baseline neuropsychological testing . 5 . Concurrent Therapy Treatment primary malignancy systemic therapy ( chemotherapy biologic agent ) deliver concurrently treatment intracranial disease . However , treatment primary site local therapy , either surgery radiotherapy , perform concurrently treatment intracranial disease . Patients receive glucocorticoid taper low possible dose , stop altogether , treat physician . If glucocorticoid dose adjust give first time , patient must remain stable dose glucocorticoid least 3 day prior initial neurocognitive testing , CT MR image . 6 . Patients need emergent radiation therapy brain metastasis exclude 7 . Patients must evidence leptomeningeal metastasis . 8 . Patients must HIV positive . 9 . Other medical condition deem PI associate make patient ineligible protocol investigation . 10 . Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude potential mutagenic effect develop fetus newborn . 11 . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy likely interfere study procedure result .</criteria>
