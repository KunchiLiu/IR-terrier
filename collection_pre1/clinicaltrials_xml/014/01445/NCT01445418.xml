	<brief_summary>Background : - Carboplatin approve Food Drug Administration treat cancer . - AZD2281 experimental drug class agent call PARP inhibitor . PARP protein -involved repair DNA damage ; PARP inhibitor interfere process . Objectives : - To determine optimum dos AZD2281 carboplatin safely use patient breast ovarian cancer . - To evaluate response tumor drug combination determine side effect treatment . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old breast ovarian cancer family history cancer BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . Design : - In dose escalation study , first small group patient receive small study dose AZD2281 carboplatin . Subsequent group receive incrementally high dos first AZD2281 carboplatin long precede group experience unacceptable side effect . When high safe dose determine , additional patient receive dose . - Patients receive treatment 21-day cycle follow : AZD2281 mouth twice day every day ; carboplatin thorough vein day 8 cycle . Treatment may continue long beneficial . - Evaluations treatment include follow : - Physical examination 1 week start treatment every 3 week . - Blood test weekly first 4 week treatment every 3 week . - CT scan image test ultrasound MRI every 6 week evaluate tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : AZD2281 ( KU-0059436 ) oral PARP-1 PART-2 inhibitor affect tumor growth impair ability cell repair damage DNA . Carboplatin cause covalent cross-linking DNA stall replication fork would usually repair nucleotide excision repair homologous recombination ( HR ) . Sporadic breast ( triple negative ) ovarian cancer show exhibit BRCA1-like phenotype . BRCA1/2 proteins critical function homologous DNA repair pathway . BRCA1/2 mutation carrier high risk breast ovarian cancer , increase risk pancreatic cancer prostate cancer . Mutation carrier show increased susceptibility DNA damaging agent , platinum . BRCA1/2 deficient cell show sensitive PARP inhibition alone combination DNA damaging agent . Combining two agent background impaired HR BRCA1/2 mutation potitive malignancy may result synergistic anti-tumor effect . Objectives : Determine safety toxicity combination AZD2281 carboplatin BRCA1/2-associated familial recurrent breast ovarian cancer patient ( cohort 1 , Group A ) , non-high risk serous ovarian cancer patient ( Group B ) , non-high risk triple negative breast cancer patient ( Group C ) . Determine pharmacodynamics , estimate biochemical change apoptosis PARP signal transduction pathway tumor stromal cell response treatment expansion cohort ( cohort 2 ) MTD pilot fashion . Eligibility : Adults breast ovarian CA metastatic unresectable standard curativetherapies exist longer effective . Documented deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation BRCAPRO score great equal 30 % . Non-high risk serous ovarian cancer ( negative family history , BRCAPRO score less equal 20 % negative BRCA1/2 mutation test ) . Documented ER negative , PR negative , Her2neu negative breast cancer ( negative family history and/or BRCAPRO score less equal 10 % ( negative BRCA1/2 mutation test ) . Patients must prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy least 4 week . All patient enrol cohort 2 must least one lesion amenable biopsy . ECOG performance status 0-2 adequate organ marrow function . Design : Patients receive AZD2281 day 1-7 21 day cycle maximize PARP inhibition carboplatin administration day 2 . Carboplatin administer q3weeks continuation AZD2281 BID day 1-7 21 day cycle . AZD2281 carboplatin escalate sequentially Cohort 1 ( Groups A , B , C ) , maximum tolerate dose determine , Cohort 2 enrol assessment translational endpoint . Patients evaluated toxicity clinic every 3 week every cycle response use RECIST criterion . The clinic visit change every 4 week patient continue stay study longer two year minimal disease . Imaging study obtain every 3 cycle patient stay study longer four year . The clinic visit change every two month ( +/- 7 day ) image study obtain every four month ( +/- 7 day ) patient stay study longer five year . Tumor biopsy plasma serum sample obtain patient Cohort 2 treatment ( biopsy mandatory ) , prior treatment cycle 2 , day 1 , time disease progression ( biopsy optional ) . Tumor biopsy ( optional ) also take `` super responder '' Cohort 1 durable response longer two year . A minimum 84 maximum 101 patient need achieve objective trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must breast and/or epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , and/or fallopian tube cancer histologically cytologically confirm NCI metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist longer effective . All patient cohort 1 must measurable and/or evaluable disease . Patients expansion cohort 2 must safely biopsible disease determine interventional radiologist must agree first mandatory biopsy ( two biopsy optional ) . Breast cancer patient locally advance , unresectable disease must previously treat standard therapy . There limit number prior therapy . Patients must least 6 month last platinum exposure . Platinumresistant patient may participate . Patients allergic reaction platinum ( include grade 3 without reaction protocol , include grade 2 face pretrement , graduate treatment exposure ) still eligible . Age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin great equal 10g/dL leukocytesgreater equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal upper limit normal ( ULN ) absence Gilbert syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X ULN creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min 24hour urine OR serum creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dl correct Ionized Calcium less equal ULN potassium within normal limit A document deleterious BRCA 1/2 germline mutation BRCAPRO score great equal 30 % patient enrol Group A . For patient enrol sporadic serous epithelial ovarian cancer group , Group B , negative family history ( BRCAPRO score less equal 20 % negative BRCA1/2 mutation test ) . For patient enrol triple negative breast cancer ( ER/PR /Her2 ) group , Group B , negative family history /or BRCAPRO score less equal 10 % negative BRCA1/2 mutation test ) . The effect AZD develop human fetus unknown . For reason platinum agent know teratogenic , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately , Patients childbearing potential continue contraception least three month follow last dose therapy study . Toxicities previous cancer therapy must recover grade 1 ( define CTC 3.0 ) . Chronic stable grade 2 peripheral neuropathy secondary neurotoxicity prior therapy may consider case case basis Principal Investigator .
