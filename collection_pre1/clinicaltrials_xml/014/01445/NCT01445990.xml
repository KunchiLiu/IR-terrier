	<brief_summary>Evaluation capillary glycaemia lactataemia measurement pedicle impairment diagnosis free tissue transfer realize . These measure do surgical reconstruction free tissue flap , simultaneously clinical examination . These biological data n't available make clinical diagnosis complication ; clinical examination allow way . A posteriori , clinical biological parameter compare order determine capillary glycaemia lactataemia measurement good procedure free tissue flap monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Free Flap Monitoring Using Capillary Lactate Glucose Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Free tissue flap reconstruction become reliable technique . Nevertheless , pedicle thrombosis dread , early diagnosis complication make , high surgical salvage rate . Clinical monitoring remain useful used monitoring method , make late unreliable diagnosis . Numerous study search ideal monitoring technics regard free flap . Nowadays , efficient one often deal expensive invasive technics . In study , capillary lactataemia glycaemia measurement evaluate pedicle impairment diagnosis . Measurements 2 biological parameter seem powerful screen test pedicle impairment microdialysis . But parameter measure case interstitial tissue . Capillary measurement probably provide different result , need evaluate . For purpose , surgical reconstruction free tissue flap clinically monitor five day , every hour first 24 hour , every 4 hour next 4 day . Simultaneously , blind measurement capillary lactataemia glycaemia perform . Biological clinical data systematically write correspond table individual register together time examination do . In register , complication evolution flap record . A posteriori , parallel clinical biological event study . This multicenter prospective study show first capillary measurement glucose lactate permit screen pedicle complication free flap . In case efficacy technique , threshold glucose lactate permitting diagnosis calculate order define sensitive screen test . Moreover , temporal difference clinical biological diagnosis pedicle impairment study .</detailed_description>
