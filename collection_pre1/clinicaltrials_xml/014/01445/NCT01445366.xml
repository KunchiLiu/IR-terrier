	<brief_summary>This prospective cross-over study include 10 stable hemodialysis patient chronic kidney disease stage 5 . The cross-over study last 2 week study dialysis session midweek . During one session , patient dialyze 4 hour high volume post dilution hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) FX800 hemodialyzer ( Fresenius Medical Care ) blood flow 300mL/min , dialysate flow 500mL/min , substitution flow 75mL/min . During midweek session , patient dialyze 8 hour high flux hemodialysis ( HD ) FX80 hemodialyzer ( Fresenius Medical Care ) blood flow 200mL/min dialysate flow 500mL/min . The HDF HD session randomize . Blood sample draw pre post dialysis arterial blood line , 30min dialysis start , blood sample drawn inlet outlet line . At dialysate outlet line , partial dialysate collection perform outlet line . Blood dialysate sample analyze broad range retention solute like small water soluble solute , middle molecule , protein bound solute . These data use calculate solute removal evaluate difference solute removal high volume post dilution HDF high flux HD .</brief_summary>
