	<brief_summary>Background : - After allogeneic ( donor ) stem cell transplantation , new immune system grow patient transplant donor stem cell lymphocytes ( type immune cell ) . Donor lymphocytes , unlike patient lymphocyte , often recognize patient tumor cell foreign destroy . - It think tumor shrinkage stem cell transplantation result donor T lymphocytes , T cell . Some study show patient tumor T cell well able keep tumor growth check . - Patients donor stem cell transplantation may donor T cell tumor recognize fight cancer . Compared donor T cell take directly donor infused patient , donor T cell find patient tumor may specific cancer cell thus well able attack tumor . Also , T cell find way tumor , may less likely recognize attack non-tumor tissue T cell give donor lymphocyte infusion . - The T cell may especially effective control tumor give additional stimulus become active . Costimulation name body natural process provide extra stimulus , perform cell laboratory . Costimulation produce large number activate cell may able attack cancer cell shrink tumor . Objectives : -To evaluate ability lymphocyte find tumor patient receive donor stem cell transplant control tumor growth . Eligibility : -Patients 18 75 year age B-cell cancer continue grow recur remission follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation . This include patient receive transplant unrelated donor cord blood . Design : - Immune cell collect patient blood blood stem cell donor . - Patients undergo surgery remove tumor small piece skin . In laboratory , donor T cell isolated tumor costimulated expand number cell activate . - The expand , activate T cell infused patient . - Patients needle biopsy possibly surgery remove sample remain tumor research study . - Patients follow NIH clinic 48 hour cell infusion , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 week infusion . Tumor size monitor every month CT scan , possibly also PET bone marrow aspiration biopsy , first 3 month cell infuse . Thereafter , visit less frequent ( every 3 month , every 6 month , yearly ) minimum 5-year follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The prognosis patient B-cell lymphoid malignancy ( BCL ) relapse refractory disease allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( AlloHSCT ) poor . Effective therapy patient fail withdrawal immune suppression administration donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) identify . - In set recurrent refractory BCL , immunologic graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect generate unmanipulated donor lymphocyte often durable accompany graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . - We hypothesize lymphocyte find tumor alloHSCT donor origin , tumor-derived , may tumor-specific home antigen specificity characteristic . Similarly , inpatient bone marrow involvement tumor , marrow may enrich similarly tumor-specific T cell . Further , activation expansion cell CD3/CD28 costimulation may yield effective form cell therapy DLI alloHSCT , enhance GVT effect less GVHD . Objectives : - To evaluate feasibility isolate expand clinically relevant number TDL patient alloHSCT . - To determine safety , vis-a-vis infusion toxicity and/or GVHD , administer TDL . Eligibility : - Adults B cell malignancy tumor respond successful T cell engraftment alloHSCT , withdrawal immune suppression administration donor lymphocyte infusion eligible trial . - Subjects must minimum 1.5 cm accessible tumor amenable resection minimal surgical morbidity and/or bone marrow tumor involvement . Design : - Subjects accessible lesion surgically resect and/or harvest via bone marrow aspiration . - Lymphocytes liberate expand use co-stimulatory approach anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic bead generate TDL and/or marrow-TDL . - 1.0 x 10 ( 6 ) - 1.0 x 10 ( 8 ) TDL administer . - Subjects monitor development infusion reaction ( in-hospital 24 hour infusion ) , GVHD ( weekly four week monthly ) tumor response ( monthly ) . - Two cohort enrol , arm evaluating TDL resect tumor arm evaluate marrow-TDL tumor-involved bone marrow . For TDL arm , 15 18 patient 18 donor enrol ; marrow-TDL arem , 15 patient 15 donor enrol . Both arm test primary endpoint feasibility ( least 11 15 tumor yield 1.0 x 10 ( 6 ) TDL/kg meeting define release criterion ) safety ( primarily define great risk develop grade II-IV acute GVHD day 28 standard therapy unmanipulated DLI ) .</detailed_description>
