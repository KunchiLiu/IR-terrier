	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Bortezomib Cetuximab With Without Cisplatin Treat Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Advanced squamous cell carcinoma involve head neck ( SCCHN ) mortality exceed 50 percent significant impact function quality life . - Treatment locally advance SCCHN anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) antibody cetuximab ( Erbitux C225 ) DNA damage agent cisplatin concurrent radiation therapy ( RT ) show improvement response , survival , organ preservation , approximately10-20 percent RT alone . The combination cetuximab , cisplatin RT currently investigation next standard concurrent chemo-RT patient SCCHN . - Cetuximab inhibits EGFR , overexpressed approximately 90 percent SCCHN associate decreased patient survival . EGFR contribute activation Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) Signal Transduction Activating Transcription Factor ( STAT3 ) pathways , promote induction gene involve cell proliferation survival . - Recently , Nuclear Factor-kappaB ( NF-kB ) pathway show independent pathway important alter expression prosurvival gene , malignant phenotype , prognosis . - Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( Velcade , PS-341 ) inhibit NF-kB target gene , well increase expression tumor suppressor gene p53 SCCHN . Bortezomib combination RT , cetuximab cisplatin induces great cytotoxic effect cancer cell treatment individually preclinical study . - In phase I trial determine feasibility administer bortezomib concurrently cetuximab RT , cetuximab , cisplatin RT . We hypothesize bortezomib give combination acceptable toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) demonstrate clinical activity effect NF-kB , MAPK STAT3 pathway signal apoptosis SCCHN . Specific Objectives : Primary Objectives -To evaluate feasibility toxicity combine proteasome inhibitor bortezomib cetuximab , cetuximab cisplatin concurrent radiation therapy patient advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , identify MTD bortezomib clinical phase 2 development . Secondary Objectives -To evaluate objective response rate , progression-free survival overall survival regimen . To determine effect bortezomib cetuximab , bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin inhibit activation NF-kB , EGFR , MAPK , STAT3 signal pathway , expression pro-survival pro-angiogenesis gene regulate pathway , effect proliferation , apoptosis angiogenesis . Eligibility : -Patients advance Stage IV SCCHN , without history prior neck radiation , concurrent chemo-RT option . Design : - All patient receive standard RT total dose 70 Gy , 2 Gy/day fraction , 5 days/week , concurrent either bortezomib cetuximab , bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin . - Bortezomib give follow dose escalation schema ( 3 dose level 0.7 , 1 1.3 mg/m2/dose ) IV twice weekly first two week three 21-day cycle include 1 week break , start week prior RT initiation total 7-8 week . - In group A , patient receive bortezomib , cetuximab RT , group B , bortezomib , cetuximab , cisplatin RT . - Previously establish MTDs use weekly administration cetuximab ( 400mg/m2 initially 250 mg/m ( 2 ) IV weekly ) , cisplatin ( 30mg/m ( 2 ) IV weekly ) . - Cetuximab cetuximab cisplatin give first dose bortezomib week prior RT continue weekly RT ( 7-8 weekly dos ) . Drug therapy give RT completion . - Groups A accrue group B , identify MTD combination bortezomib , cetuximab RT , bortezomib , cetuximab , cisplatin RT , expansion phase 2 development . - Serum blood collect study potential proteomic genetic marker drug sensitivity effect , tumor response recurrence , within 2 week pretreatment day 5 , 12 bortezomib cycle 1 , day 12 cycle 2 3 . Serum collect thereafter every 3 month 24 month . - Optional tumor and/or skin biopsy perform within 2 week start treatment day 5 first week treatment drug alone , day 12 start RT correlative study combine effect bortezomib cetuximab , bortezomib cetuximab cisplatin signal pathway activation , apoptosis marker , without RT . ( Details correlative study ) . Patients evaluate CT FDG-PET pre-treatment response 8 week post-RT use WHO RECIST criterion . - The study design sample size Phase 1 , 3-6 patient per dose level establish MTD . An additional 6-10 patient ( group ) treat MTD order ass toxicity , response molecular correlative . The anticipated sample size 6 46 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Histologically cytologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma , include variant , undifferentiated/poorly differentiate carcinoma head neck ( site , except nasopharynx ) . 2 . Previously untreated stage IV disease ( AJCC stag system , 6th edition ) , , 3 . Patients residual disease regional recurrence head neck cancer surgery and/or chemotherapy , prior bortezomib , EGFR inhibitor therapy head neck radiotherapy . All patient eligible receive full dose radiation therapy , must evaluate accepted treatment Radiation Oncologist . Prior cisplatin allow administer great 3 month earlier . 4 .

Patients previously untreated nasopharyngeal cancer ( stage ) exclude , patient recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma eligible . 2 . Prior treatment radiation head neck , systemic EGFR inhibitor bortezomib allow . 3 . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 4 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 5 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 6 .

Patients great equal grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy bortezomib cause irreversible worsen painful type chemotherapy associate peripheral neuropathy . 8 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 9 . Pregnant woman exclude study bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 10 . HIVpositive patient patient antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential possible pharmacodynamic interaction bortezomib , cetuximab cisplatin , particularly bone marrow mucosal toxicity , could affect MTD .
