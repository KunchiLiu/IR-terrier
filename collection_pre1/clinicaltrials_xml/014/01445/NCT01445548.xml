	<brief_summary>This study determine whether drug call sirolimus safe give people geographic atrophy ( GA ) help preserve vision patient . GA advance form dry age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD affect macula , central part retina back eye need sharp , clear vision . There two type AMD , wet dry . In dry AMD , cell macula die . GA may partially cause inflammation . Sirolimus help prevent inflammation therefore may help people GA . Researchers want see whether sirolimus help prevent vision loss people GA. People least 56 year age GA relate AMD eye may eligible study . This study require least 8 visit National Eye Institute 1 year . Study visit every 2 month 1 year . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood urine test , eye exam . One eye select study eye receive sirolimus injection . - Participants sirolimus injection study eye first visit every 2 month thereafter unless contraindicate . There follow-up eye exam 1 month first injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , lead cause blindness people age 65 United States , heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment central visual acuity . AMD occur two general form , one involve choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) subsequent formation disciform scar . This often referred neovascular wet form . A second form , subject study , term dry atrophic macular degeneration involve constellation clinical feature include drusen , pigment clump and/or retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) dropout geographic atrophy ( GA ) . GA begin thin RPE involvement underlie choriocapillaris subsequently lead atrophic change macula . Inflammation may play role pathogenesis GA. Sirolimus inhibit production , signal activity many inflammatory factor relevant development GA . Therefore , objective study investigate safety possible efficacy serial sirolimus intravitreal injection participant bilateral GA. Study Population : Six participant bilateral GA associate AMD enrol . Initially , 10 participant bilateral GA associate AMD enrol . However , six enrol , sirolimus intravitreal injection longer administered participant . Design : In single-center , prospective , control , unmasked , Phase I/II study , one eye eligible participant initially randomize investigational product ( intravitreal sirolimus ) fellow eye observe . Participants initially receive 20 μL ( 440 μg ) intravitreal injection sirolimus study eye baseline every two month thereafter unless contraindicate . As September 2012 , sirolimus intravitreal injection longer administered participant . Both study fellow eye observe every two month study terminates . The study terminate participant follow Month 12 . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome rate change area GA base mask grading external Reading Center fundus photograph study eye fellow eye Month 12 compare baseline . Secondary outcome include change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , change drusen area base masked digital grading fundus photography , absolute relative change area GA measure use fundus photography autofluorescence imaging , development exudative AMD measure use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse event ( AEs ) . Ocular safety outcome indicate change visual acuity , ocular surface change , intraocular inflammation ocular change consistent natural progression GA .</detailed_description>
