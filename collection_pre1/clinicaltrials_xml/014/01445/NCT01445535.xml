	<brief_summary>Studies conduct National Cancer Institute suggest certain chemotherapy drug may effective give continuous infusion vein rather standard method rapid intravenous injection . One combination six chemotherapy drug , know EPOCH-R , high degree effectiveness people certain kind cancer . Recent evidence also indicate effect chemotherapy may improve combine treatment monoclonal antibody , purify protein specially make attach foreign substance cancer cell . This protocol specifically adults type cancer know T-cell NK-cell lymphoma , never receive chemotherapy previously . The additional monoclonal antibody study , call siplizumab , manufacture attach CD2 protein contain type tumor . Study volunteer need undergo initial period evaluation may take 3 week may do outpatient basis . Evaluation may include follow test : blood urine test , test lung heart function , lumbar puncture take sample cerebrospinal fluid , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , full-body positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , bone marrow biopsy , biopsy suspect tumor area . During study , patient receive EPOCH-R chemotherapy , include follow drug : etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , rituximab . The additional drug , siplizumab , give IV infusion first day treatment several hour . When siplizumab IV infusion complete , drug doxorubicin , etoposide , vincristine give continuous IV infusion next 4 day ( , continuously total 96 hour ) . When infusion complete , drug rituximab cyclophosphamide give IV infusion several hour Day 5 . Prednisone give mouth twice day 5 day . Patients may give drug treat side effect chemotherapy prevent possible infection . The siplizumab-EPOCH-R therapy repeat every 21 day , know cycle therapy , total 6 cycle . Following fourth sixth treatment cycle ( approximately week 12 18 ) siplizumab-EPOCH-R , study researcher perform blood test CT/MRI scan patient assess response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial Siplizumab Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-Rituximab T- NK-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The clinical outcome patient T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma significantly inferior outcome patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . In report le 20 % patient T cell lymphoid malignancy remain free disease 5 year . The combination alemtuzumab EPOCH chemotherapy evaluate patient chemotherapy naive aggressive T NK cell lymphoid malignancy . Dose-limiting bone marrow toxicity prevent escalation alemtuzumab dose . Siplizumab humanize monoclonal antibody direct CD2 demonstrate activity treatment relapsed/refractory T cell lymphoma , suggest development combine chemotherapy untreated patient . Siplizumab cause EBV lymphoproliferative disease patient treat weekly schedule administration . Rituximab prevents development EBV lymphoproliferative disease allogeneic transplant setting may active prevent EBV-related B cell lymphoma setting . Objectives : Determine toxicity maximum tolerate dose siplizumab dose-adjusted EPOCH rituximab chemotherapy chemotherapy na ( SqrRoot ) CD2- express T NK lymphoid malignancy . Eligibility : CD2-expressing lymphoid malignancy . Patients chemotherapy naive aggressive T &amp; NK lymphoma . Patients alkpositive anaplastic large cell lymphoma patient T cell precursor disease eligible . Design : Four dose level siplizumab evaluate determine toxicity profile preliminary fashion activity combination dose-adjusted EPOCH rituximab . Four dose level siplizumab explore , cohort three six patient . Patients receive 3.4 , 4.8 , 8.5 , 15 mg/kg siplizumab day 1 therapy , follow dose-adjusted EPOCH-rituximab chemotherapy day 1-5 every 3 week total 6 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : CD2expressing lymphoid malignancy , confirm pathology flow cytometry staff Hematopathology Section , Laboratory Pathology , NCI . At least 30 % malignant cell must CD2 positive inclusion study . Patients chemotherapy naive T &amp; NK lymphoma , include limited peripheral T cell lymphoma ( nos ) , gammadelta hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma , subcutaneous panniculitislike T cell , NKT cell lymphoma confirm pathology flow cytometry staff Hematopathology Section , Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Patients alkpositive anaplastic large cell lymphoma patient T cell precursor disease eligible . Age great equal 18 year . Laboratory test : Creatinine le equal 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance great equal 60 ml/min ; bilirubin less 2.0 mg/dl unless due Gilbert ( unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without know cause ) , AST ALT less equal 3 time ULN ( AST ALT less equal 6 time ULN patient hyperalimentation abnormality felt due hyperalimentation ) ; ANC great equal 1000/mm ( 3 ) , platelet great equal 75,000/mm ( 3 ) ; unless impairment due respective organ impairment tumor . No active symptomatic ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction congestive heart failure within past year . Patients must mark baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval ( e.g. , demonstration QTc interval &gt; 500 millisecond ( m ) ) . HIV negative , unknown effect combine therapy chemotherapy immunosuppressive agent HIV progression . Signed informed consent patient patient representative . Willing use contraception . Not pregnant nursing , unknown effect DAEPOCHR siplizumab develop fetus infant . No serious underlie medical condition infection would contraindicate treatment . Patients CNS involvement eligible treatment study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients le 18 year age exclude siplizumab give minor combination chemotherapy .</criteria>
