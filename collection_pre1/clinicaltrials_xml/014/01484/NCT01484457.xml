	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Closed-loop control system artificial pancreas use multi-parametric model predictive control develop evaluate safely patient Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) control blood glucose concentration . This study seek combine real-time continuous glucose sense automate insulin delivery closed-loop system achieve euglycemia patient T1DM . The end result line research artificial pancreas provide around-the-clock glucose regulation control insulin delivery response detect pattern change glucose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal JDRF Artificial Pancreas Project produce autonomous artificial pancreas safely effectively regulate glycemia people type 1 diabetes mellitus . In work , fully automate closed-loop system combine subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) pump sophisticated control algorithm . This proof-of-concept study demonstrate controller could bring patient back relatively normal glucose concentration unannounced meal mild hyperglycemia . Once system initiate , insulin delivery calculate automatically . There outside intervention either subject medical personnel . An artificial pancreas system aim replicate normal beta-cell function use subcutaneous-subcutaneous ( sc-sc ) route need address inherent delay glucose sense insulin delivery . Our strategic approach closed-loop system operate safely without knowledge meal disturbance . We develop Artificial Pancreas System ( APS© ) use clinically evaluate control strategy allow efficient glycemic control without priori meal information . The Artificial Pancreas device use Artificial Pancreas System ( APS© ) platform OmniPod insulin pump , DexCom SEVEN PLUS CGM multi-parametric model predictive control algorithm ( mpMPC ) insulin-on-board ( IOB ) safety constraint .</detailed_description>
