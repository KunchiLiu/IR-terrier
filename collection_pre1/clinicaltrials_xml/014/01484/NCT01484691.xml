	<brief_summary>This single center study asthmatic subject healthy control investigate mechanism asthma detailed molecular analysis airway tissues fluid . The primary goal investigate role microRNAs Th2-driven inflammation asthma . The investigator hypothesize asthma associate abnormal expression miRNAs T cell favor differentiation Th2-cells . The investigator hypothesize asthma heterogeneous base presence absence Th2-driven inflammation abnormality T cell miRNA expression prominent subgroup high level Th2-driven inflammation ( assess use molecular marker investigator previously establish ) . Finally , investigator hypothesize inhaled corticosteroid normalize T-cell miRNA abnormality observe asthma , corticosteroid treat Th2-driven inflammation . The sample collect also facilitate pursuit secondary analysis design investigate mechanism inflammation remodel asthma well molecular phenotype asthma .</brief_summary>
