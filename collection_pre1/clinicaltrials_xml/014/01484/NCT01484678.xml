	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine potential magnetic resonance image monitor disease progression serve objective outcome measure clinical trial Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) . The investigator also hope learn change occur muscle low leg arm boys DMD . The investigator compare muscle ambulatory non-ambulatory boy DMD muscle healthy child age monitor disease progression boys DMD 5-10 year period . The amount muscle damage fat investigator measure also related performance daily activity , walk loss muscle strength . In small group subject investigator also assess effect corticosteroid drug muscle measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective proposal validate potential noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) spectroscopy ( MRS ) monitor disease progression serve outcome measure clinical trial Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) . DMD one devastate genetically link neuromuscular disease characterize absence dystrophin , result progressive muscle weakness , loss walk ability premature death . Despite poor prognosis patient muscular dystrophy , therapeutic intervention lack , outcome measure clinical trial limit measure muscle function , serum biomarkers muscle breakdown invasive muscle biopsy . Additional quantitative outcome measure noninvasive sensitive change muscle structure composition need facilitate rapid translation promise new intervention preclinical study clinical trial . As , proposal target development validation magnetic resonance noninvasive biomarker disease progression muscular dystrophy . Using multi-site research design study examine intramuscular lipid content , muscle damage/inflammation contractile area low extremity and/or upper extremity muscle 200 ambulatory non-ambulatory boy DMD 100 healthy age match boy use combination MRI MRS technology . In order ass sensitivity MR measure disease progression , boys DMD reevaluate yearly 6 month interval . In addition , investigator correlate change MR measure standard measure disease progression , loss muscle strength functional ability . Using MRI/MRS investigator also examine effect initiate corticosteroid treatment skeletal muscle characteristic composition . Finally , investigator deposit immortalized fibroblast carefully characterize DMD boys participate study establish tissue repository . The investigator anticipate MR technique develop validate proposal suitable clinical trial wide range muscular dystrophy neuromuscular disease . In addition , MR characterization may serve powerful tool advance understanding pathogenesis muscular dystrophy help guide design future trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria boys DMD : 1 . Ambulatory nonambulatory male ( age 518 ) previously diagnose DMD base : clinical feature onset symptom age five elevate serum creatine kinase level absence dystrophin expression , determine immunostain western blot ( &lt; 2 % ) and/or DNA confirmation dystrophin mutation . 2 . Subjects exclude base corticosteroid treatment Inclusion Criteria age match control : 1 . Ambulatory male ( age 518 ) without disease injury low extremity 1 . Males contraindication MR examination 2 . Males unstable medical problem 3 . Males able cooperate test 4 . Males secondary condition may impact muscle metabolism , muscle function functional ability ( i.e . cerebral palsy , endocrine disorder , mitochondrial disease ) 5 . Healthy boys participate competitive sport specific train excess 8 hour per week . Participation multiple recreational sport activity exclusion .</criteria>
