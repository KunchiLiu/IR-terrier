	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia know associated loss muscle mass result reduce number muscle fibre , atrophy remain muscle fibre , increased infiltration non-contractile tissue ( collagen , fat ) . Accentuated cancer treatment , sarcopenia impairs muscle function result high risk physical disability death . The commonly used test sarcopenia screen consists DEXA ( Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) scan . However , test ca n't provide structural muscle information . In contrast , mechanical property muscle tissue explore use acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI ) . The question remain whether muscle sonoelastography use ARFI imaging could helpful sarcopenia screening . For , volunteer recruit three group : ≤ 30 year ( Gr A ) ≥ 70years , without serious chronic disease , patient ≥ 70 year present curative care cancer ( Gr C ) . The volunteer belong group A B follow one day . The patient include group C follow 6 month . For latter group ; first visit ( t0 ) take place treatment second visit take place 6 month later ( t6months ) Volunteers clinical examination ( weight , stature , BMI , performance status/ ECOG ) evaluate nutritional status ( MNA-SF , 24h dietary recall ) physical capacity ( IPAQ , SPPB , low limb muscle strength , 6-min walk test , QLQ-C30 item relative fatigue symptom ) .</brief_summary>
