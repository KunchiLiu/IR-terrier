	<brief_summary>As first-in-class ( Central Pattern Generator CPG activator ) approach , tritherapy candidate call SPINALON identify currently development capacity temporarily induce episode involuntary locomotor movement . The primary objective Phase I/IIa study ass safety tolerability single escalate dose SPINALON ( levodopa + carbidopa + buspirone ) chronic spinal cord-injured patient . As secondary objective , preliminary evidence efficacy also seek .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety , Tolerability MTD Central Pattern Generator-activating Tritherapy ( SPINALON ) Patients With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) generally consider irreversible condition curative treatment yet find . A recent study sponsor Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation reveal incidence range 40 60 case per million population prevalence estimate several time great ( new data : 1,275,000 case ) previously report ( previous data : 200,000 case ) . SPINALON ( levodopa + carbidopa + buspirone ) discover Dr. Guertin colleague drug treatment candidate acutely elicit temporarily ( last approximately 30-60 minute ) episodes CPG activity correspond powerful weight-bearing hindlimb step completely SCI subject ( preclinical efficacy data obtain mouse turtle completely spinal cord transect thoracically ) . As , SPINALON currently develop become chronic treatment ( physical activity-based approach drive pharmacologically ) multiple health problem so-called 'secondary complication ' associate specifically lack physical activity ( sarcopenia , osteoporosis , cardiovascular problem , dyslipidemia , obesity , type II diabetes , anemia , immune system deficiency , deep vein cloth , depression , etc. ) . This study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , single dose escalation study fifty-one ( 51 ) patient receive either placebo capsule ( starch ) capsule buspirone , levodopa/carbidopa buspirone/levodopa/carbidopa ( SPINALON ) .</detailed_description>
