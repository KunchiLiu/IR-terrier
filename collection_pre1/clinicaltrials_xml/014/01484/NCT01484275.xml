	<brief_title>A Study Siltuximab ( Anti- IL 6 Monoclonal Antibody ) Patients With High-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient investigator know treatment give ) , multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy siltuximab compare placebo patient high-risk SMM ( define bone marrow plasma cell &gt; =10 % either serum monoclonal protein &gt; =3 g/dL , abnormal free light chain ratio &lt; 0.126 &gt; 8 serum M-protein &lt; 3 g/dL &gt; =1 g/dL ) . Approximately 74 patient receive either siltuximab placebo intravenous ( IV , injection vein ) infusion every 4 week progression symptomatic multiple myeloma , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , end study ( approximately 4 year randomization last patient ) . Efficacy , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , potential biomarkers assess time point define protocol . Patient report outcome ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer , Quality Life Questionnaire-Core 30 , Brief Pain Inventory [ bad pain ] , Non-Chemotherapy Anemia Symptom Scale ) administer procedure treatment visit . Patient safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
