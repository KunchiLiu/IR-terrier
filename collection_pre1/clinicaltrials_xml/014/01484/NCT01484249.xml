	<brief_summary>This study design First In Man ( FIM ) trial evaluate feasibility technical capability Claret CE Pro System deliver two embolic filter brachiocephalic artery leave common carotid artery Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) procedure order protect neurovasculature debris liberated procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Filtration During Endovascular Aortic Valve Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) recently develop procedure whereby prosthetic aortic valve implant percutaneously , procedure demonstrate promising result high risk surgical population . TAVI currently require use large bore ( 18-26F ) catheter delivery system often difficult deliver aortic arch aortic annulus . Available data indicate TAVI associate 4-12 % procedural stroke rate approximately 10 % procedural mortality . It suggest stroke likely cause liberation embolic debris either TAVI delivery catheter advance aortic arch actual valve deployment . Given situation , availability device able protect hemisphere brain potentially embolic debris TAVI procedure emerge clinical need . Claret Medical develop technology provide protection neurovascular system TAVI valve repair procedure .</detailed_description>
