	<brief_summary>This phase II study see useful study drug AUY922 patient metastatic pancreatic cancer receive intolerant first-line chemotherapy . AUY922 intravenous drug block protein call heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) . Hsp90 work keep number protein stable active , include many protein involve tumor growth death . When Hsp90 block work , believe many protein stabilizes also block , cause tumor growth slow stop . During study , patient visit clinic week , every 4 week cycle receive AUY922 intravenously test procedure do . As part study , archive tumor tissue collect patient ask blood sample take pharmacokinetic testing . Patients invited take part optional banking blood sample future study . The primary hypothesis study AUY922 improve disease control rate compare would expect best supportive care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single arm open label Phase II clinical trial evaluate efficacy AUY922 patient advance pancreatic cancer previously treat intolerant first line chemotherapy . The primary objective ass efficacy agent assess disease control rate ( DCR ) ( objective response plus prolonged stable disease ( &gt; 16 week ) . The current standard therapy patient advance , metastatic inoperable pancreatic cancer previously treat intolerant first line chemotherapy best supportive care . New treatment option urgently need . Heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) ATP-dependent molecular chaperone protein involve stabilization number membrane intracellular protein include HER2 , BCR-ABL , C-SRC , EGFR , RAF , VEGFR , AKT , RAS . Many protein highly express pancreatic adenocarcinoma . AUY922 novel isoxazole-based HSP90 inhibitor . AUY922 act inhibit HSP90 ATPase activity ( IC50 30 nm ) prevent formation multichaperone complex HSP90 heat shock protein . This prevent HSP90 perform function client protein .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma pancreas metastatic disease Patients receive least one prior systemic anticancer therapy advance disease , may include gemcitabine base 5FU base therapeutic regimen . Patients resected disease relapse within 6 month completion adjuvant gemcitabine would also eligible . Patients progressive disease ( radiological confirmation require ) least one line chemotherapy pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Patients must least one measurable lesion define RECIST criterion . Irradiated lesion evaluable disease progression . Patient 's age ≥ 18 year age Patients may receive prior radiation treatment management local disease provide disease progression document , toxicity resolve , ≤ grade 1 last fraction radiation treatment complete least 4 week prior randomization ( 2 week palliative radiotherapy ) . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Life expectancy great 12 week Patients must follow laboratory value within 7 day prior start treatment : Hematological : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 90 g/L Platelets ( plt ) ≥ 100 x 109/L Biochemistry : Potassium within normal limit Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) Phosphorus within normal limit Magnesium LLN correctable supplement Adequate liver function define : AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) liver metastases present Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN eGFR ≥ 50 mL /min Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior randomization . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic ≥ 24 month order consider `` nonchildbearing potential '' . This document appropriately patient 's medical history . Patients history another primary malignancy clinically significant require active intervention Prior treatment HSP90 HDAC inhibitor compound , include valproic acid Patients significant history cardiac disease , include : Impaired cardiac function , include one following : History ( family history ) long QT syndrome Mean QTc ≥ 450 msec baseline ECG History clinically manifest ischemic heart disease ≤ 6 month prior study start History heart failure leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction ( LVEF ≤ 45 % ) MUGA ECHO Clinically significant ECG abnormality History presence atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) Patients currently receive treatment medication relative risk prolong QTc interval induce Torsades de Pointes switch alternative drug discontinue prior commence start treatment . Obligate use cardiac pacemaker Patients serious active infection time registration serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . Patients known central nervous system metastasis . CT scan brain NOT require unless suspicion CNS metastasis . Patients condition ( e.g . psychological , geographical , etc . ) permit compliance protocol . Pregnant lactating female . Women child bear potential sexually active male employ adequate contraception . Adequate method contraception include use oral contraceptive DepotProvera , additional barrier method ( diaphragm spermicidal gel OR condom spermicide ) ; doublebarrier method ( diaphragm spermicidal gel AND condom spermicide ) ; partner vasectomy total abstinence . Patients receive systemic anticancer treatment prior first dose study medication within follow time frame : Radiotherapy , conventional chemotherapy : within 4 week Palliative radiotherapy : within 2 week Monoclonal antibody : within 4 week Nitrosoureas mitomycin : within 6 week Targeted agent investigational dug : within 4 week Patients surgery within 2 week prior registration recover therapy . Patients know HIV positive . Testing required absence clinical sign symptom suggestive HIV infection . Treatment therapeutic dos coumarintype anticoagulant . ( Maximum daily dose 2 mg , line patency permit ) Patients know disorder due deficiency bilirubin glucuronidation ( e.g . Gilbert 's syndrome ) Unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 within 72 hour prior registration Patients acute chronic renal disease . Chronic renal disease define patient stable creatinine ≥ 1.5 ULN and/or eGFR ≤ 50mL/min . Acute renal disease define patient acute ( within less 4 week ) rise creatinine ≥ 1.5 ULN and/or eGFR ≤ 50mL/min , resolve previously normal baseline level . Patients active liver disease require intervention . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request .</criteria>
