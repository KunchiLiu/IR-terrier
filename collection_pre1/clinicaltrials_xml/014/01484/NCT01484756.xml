	<brief_summary>Nutrient deficiency immune dysfunction old person result high prevalence acute respiratory infection , lead impair nutritional status . The study objective determine effect multi micro-nutrient supplementation nutritional upper respiratory infection among apparently healthy community-dwelling elderly . The main hypothesis whether daily multi micro-nutrient supplementation could reduce incidence prevalence upper respiratory infection among apparently healthy community-dwelling old person . Inclusion criterion apparently independent healthy male female old person age 60 year , take multi micro-nutrient supplementation last month . The study design community-based double-blind control trial involve 296 community-dwelling old person age 60 , Mampang Prapatan district , South Jakarta . Participants randomize receive either 40 mg elemental zinc ( gluconate ) , 120 mg ascorbic acid , 6 mg B-carotene , 15 mg alpha tocopherol ( d-alpha-tocopheryl acid succinate ) 400 microgram folic acid ( intervention group ) 400 mg calcium carbonate ( control group ) . Supplements take daily six month , August 2008 March 2009 . Nutritional health status measure supplementation . Poisson regression analysis use evaluate effect daily multi micro-nutrient supplementation incidence prevalence upper respiratory infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor nutritional status old person may predispose increase risk upper respiratory tract infection , however amenable reduction multi micro-nutrient supplementation . For become successful healthy age individual , interrelationship endogenous exogenous factor must positive balance . Introducing multi micro-nutrients supplementation alternative ensures balance micro-nutrient intake enhance immune response time possibly enhance quality life healthy free-living elderly individual . The role nutritional intervention strategy show beneficial prevention infectious disease among old population order reduce burden disease , also could prevent micro-nutrient deficiency enhance immune response old person . The present study relate primary prevention activity aim enhance health status subject , particular reduce incidence prevalence rate infectious disease , especially upper respiratory tract infection . Supplementation operationally achievable implementation health center could set within exist program old person .</detailed_description>
