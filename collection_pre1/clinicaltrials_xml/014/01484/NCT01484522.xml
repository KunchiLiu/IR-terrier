	<brief_title>Laboratory Study Licensed H1N1 Influenza Vaccines HIV-1 Perinatally Infected Children Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected child typically respond poor vaccine compare normal child . The FDA currently approve several Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccine use child adult . However , little data available perinatally infect youth . Therefore , knowledge immunogenicity several license Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccine HIV-infected child youth critically important address health care need vulnerable population . Efforts currently underway evaluate Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccine healthy child well population . This study assess immune response follow receipt three Influenza A monovalent vaccine HIV-1 infect child youth . Protection HIV-1 infect child youth 2009 H1N1 Influenza A require knowledge immunogenicity new product population . The 2009 ( H1N1 ) Influenza A virus likely infect significant proportion HIV-1 infect child youth . Immunogenicity license commercially available Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccine must establish HIV-1 infected child order assure population protect . Lack protective immune response would support need additional measure protect high risk population .</detailed_description>
