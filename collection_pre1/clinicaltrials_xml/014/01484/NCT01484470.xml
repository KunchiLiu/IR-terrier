	<brief_summary>While cord blood transplant perform safely elderly patient , many still relapse . The investigator propose intensify preparative regimen patient group attempt decrease relapse , combine ex vivo expand Umbilical Cord Blood ( UCB ) unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Transplantation Elderly Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation life save procedure select high-risk recurrent hematologic malignancy marrow failure syndrome . However wide application limited availability suitably HLA match adult donor . Umbilical Cord Blood ( UCB ) increasingly use alternative hematopoietic stem cell source patient . To date , 10,000 UCB transplant perform children32-38 adults.35,39-44 Its advantage include easy procurement , decrease risk donor , reduce risk transmit infection , immediate availability cryopreserved unit , acceptable HLA mismatch . The transplantation UCB allow great degree HLA mismatching without unacceptably high incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Adult patient receive myeloablative cord blood transplant 90 % chance engraftment , carry 50 % rate transplant relate mortality .</detailed_description>
