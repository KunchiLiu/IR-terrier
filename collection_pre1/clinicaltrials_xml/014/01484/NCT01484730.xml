	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate validate performance non-invasive imaging modality assessment skin . A pressure cuff occlusion use stimulate blood flow dynamic instrument design sense . The researcher currently plan assess basic feasibility image instrument .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Multi-Spectral Imaging Laser Speckle Imaging During Vascular Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary reason include pressure cuff occlusion protocol test performance Multi-Spectral Imaging Laser Speckle Imaging measure full range vascular condition range ischemic ( under-perfused unsaturated ) hyperemic ( over-perfused over-saturated ) . 1 . .Modulated Imaging non-contact optical imaging technology detect concentration total hemoglobin , deoxygenate oxygenate hemoglobin absolute amount unit millimoles / unit volume tissue measure . 2. . Laser Speckle Imaging non-contact optical imaging technology consist coherent light source , camera , image acquisition system . This image device measure compare relative flow vasculature vary time point .</detailed_description>
