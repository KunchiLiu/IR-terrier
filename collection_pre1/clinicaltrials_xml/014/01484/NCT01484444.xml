	<detailed_description>Recently , great leap accomplish discover somatic mutation human cancer genome . With advent molecularly target therapy , somatic mutation attract attention cancer researcher . Driver mutation confer growth advantage cell occur , causally implicated cancer development therefore positively select . In contrast , passenger mutation biologically neutral confer growth advantage . Hence , driver somatic mutation conventionally optimal target cancer cell . Given grow evidence ethnic difference distribution somatic mutation , aim survey actionable somatic mutation Asian prevalent cancer . Ability assess multiple biomarkers use FNA sample could provide breakthrough gastrointestinal cancer clinical study . FNAs minimally invasive , therefore , acceptable serial tumor sample . Furthermore , cell remove method frequently represent relatively pure tumor cell population , process within minute removal tumor ; therefore , proteomic profile FNA specimens likely resemble vivo profile closely . In addition , tumor cell metastatic site obtain use FNA may provide site specific metastatic tumor profile . Acquired resistances therapy well know various cancer types.1 , 2 Serial sample tumor tissue FNA provide important resource monitor tumor change function time therapy . There numerous study report detection carcinoma cell blood patient solid tumor . Detection CTCs ( Circulating Tumor Cells ) initiation first-line therapy patient metastatic breast cancer highly predictive progression free survival overall survival.3-5 These study lead FDA clearance vertex CellSearch technology . The prognostic implication detect CTCs prior initiate therapy raise important question biological attribute cell . CTCs find metastatic disease may reflective status recurrent tumor look alternate site colonize . However , CTCs would successfully establish metastatic colony . Having ability profile tumor different metastatic site together CTCs could provide information subset robust CTCs high metastatic potential . In addition CTCs could provide alternative source tumor cell may use detect tumor change cancer progress therapy continue modify . The expression/activation profiling kinases signal transduction pathway molecule along marker critical trigger angiogenesis serial sample tumor tumor associate tissue provide valuable information change occur tumor cell function time therapy . This temporal spatial profile tumor progression enable clinician monitor rapidly 'evolving ' cancer signatures patient . The temporal site-specific profiling CTCs FNAs must utilize highly sensitive specific method interrogate limit amount cancer cell sample . Based result , plan design genome-directed clinical trial tumor type .</detailed_description>
