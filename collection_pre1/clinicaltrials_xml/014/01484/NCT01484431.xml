	<detailed_description>During Period I , tadalafil administer orally , daily , low dose approximately 5 week follow high dose approximately 5 week . Dose level calculate base body weight cohort . Heavy weight cohort &gt; =40 kg , middle weight cohort &gt; =25 kg &lt; 40 kg . Light weight cohort &lt; 25 kg . Participants complete Period 1 may continue take tadalafil Period 2 least 2 year . Starting dose exceed maximum weight range dose establish Period 1 may adjust base available safety efficacy information .</detailed_description>
