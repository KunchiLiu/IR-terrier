	<brief_title>A Study PF-00299804 When Given Through Feeding Tube Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm pharmacokinetic assessment study conduct Princess Margaret Hospital eligible patient enrol successively receive single dose PF-00299804 open-labelled , unblinded manner . All patient receive 45 mg PF-00299804 via Gastrostomy ( GT ) empty stomach ( i.e . 2 hour oral food intake GT feed ( food intake less 500 calorie permit ) ) inpatient . All patient admit overnight inpatient stay ( approximately 24 hour ) facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment . There dose reduction modification . Blood sample pharmacokinetics occur day 1 immediately prior dose PF-00299804 ( t=0 ) , t=30 minute , t=1 hour , t=2 hour , t=3 hour , t=4 hour , t=6 hour , t=12 hour , t=24 hour , t=48 hour , t=72 hour , t=96 hour , t=144 hour , t=168 hour , t=192 hour , t=216 hour .</detailed_description>

Other primary site head neck carcinoma : nasopharynx , skin , maxillary sinus unknown primary , allow Must function gastrojejunostomy tube May receive concurrent chemoradiation , radiation alone recently complete surgery locally advance disease Prior treatment agent target epidermal growth factor receptor allow . Any treatmentrelated toxicity , include laboratory abnormality , must recover CTCAE Grade 2 ( v.4.0 ) baseline , except toxicity consider safety risk . Chronic dysphagia , xerostomia local effect prior surgery radiation consider exclusion criterion stable ≥ 3 month . ECOG performance status 02 Must adequate organ function determine : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN ( upper limit normal ) calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min use formula : Creatinine clearance = [ ( 140age ) x wt ( kg ) x Constant ] / creatinine ( µmol/L ) [ Constant = 1.23 men ; 1.04 woman ] . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ; Leukocytes ≥ 3.0 x 109/L ; Hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L ( &gt; 8 g/dL ) ; Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L . Total bilirubin ≤ ULN ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) normal tracing , clinically nonsignificant medical intervention ; QTc interval ≤ 470 msec , without history Torsades de Pointes QTc abnormality Can enrol another clinical trial Prior investigational drug therapy within 30 day 5 halflives precede first dose study drug ( whichever longer ) Requirement drug highly dependent CYP2D6 metabolism since PF00299804 potent CYP2D6 inhibitor Patients currently take drug risk Torsades de Pointes Any acute/chronic medical , psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality could increase risk participation , trial drug administration interfere interpretation trial result , investigator feel , would make patient inappropriate entry . Including : History interstitial lung disease ; Uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , symptomatic congestive heart failure within past year , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , diagnosed/suspected congenital long QT syndrome ; history stroke , deep vein thrombosis , stable 6 month without require antiarrhythmics/significant change medical management ; Active bacterial , fungal viral infection include hepatitis B/C , human immunodeficiency virus . Testing required baseline symptom infection . History significant bleeding disorder , concurrent medication investigator feel may lead unacceptable coagulation perioperative interval , include : congenital bleeding disorder ; acquire bleed disorder within year Other serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability receive study treatment determine investigator Dementia alter mental status would limit ability obtain informed consent compliance requirement protocol Patients breastfeed pregnant exclude . Those reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour treatment . Patients reproductive potential include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization , postmenopausal . Patients reproductive potential/partners must agree effective contraception receive trial treatment least 3 month .
