	<detailed_description>For many year , gamma-irradiation air common method terminal sterilization ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) material use joint replacement . A serendipitous byproduct sterilization gamma-irradiation polymer crosslinking tend improve wear performance polyethylene . During 1990s , however , orthopaedic community become aware gamma-irradiation create free radical within polyethylene , render material susceptible oxidative degradation . In view potentially deleterious effect , terminal sterilization method use chemical surface treatment develop avoid free radical formation . To induce polyethylene crosslinking without residual free radical , manufacturer also develop method crosslink polyethylene follow heat treatment eliminate free radical . These crosslinked material introduce latter part 1990s clinical outcome study among hip replacement patient demonstrate substantially reduce wear early follow-up interval base radiographic measurement . However , long-term performance crosslinked polyethylene unknown investigator express concern relate vivo degradation . Additionally , crosslinked UHMWPE component show high level oxidation chain scission removal patient storage air . Among implant , unknown whether oxidation chain scission occur implantation polyethylene remove patient . This study characterize material property polyethylene liner retrieve hip replacement patient . The study population include crosslinked conventional UHMWPE liner terminally sterilize without use radiation . To quantify potential effect different storage method , liner vacuum pack frozen retrieval others store room temperature access ambient light air follow explantation include study population . Analysis technique include Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , Differential Scanning Calorimeter ( DSC ) crosslink density measurement . Crosslink density measurement evaluate function distance away articular surface rim implant . Gel hydroperoxide content also evaluate . The goal analysis well understand change polyethylene material property occur vivo ex vivo .</detailed_description>
