	<brief_summary>This study phase I , open-label , dose escalation trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) relevant biological dose ( RBD ) absence MTD new drug BI 836845 block insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway believe involved cancer growth . BI 836845 administer first time cancer patient . The study also look overall safety drug , examine drug level body specific timepoints trial ( pharmacokinetic profile ) ; effect drug may tumours also examine ( pharmacodynamics ) .</brief_summary>
