	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize significant variability management patient ascites despite guideline provide American Association Study Liver Diseases , professional organization involve management liver patient . This variability may attributable knowledge deficit , skill limitation , reflect systems-issues limit ability care provider implement clinical guideline ( time constraint , inadequate supervision , availability appropriate equipment , obtain consent non-emergent procedure ) . This variability disservice patient treat , result trainee development habit evidence base . There simple teaching tool available may improve learn retention evidence base practice . Using tool result consistent appropriate patient care , improve patient outcomes , provide good education trainee . The purpose study threefold : 1 . To improve medical house-staff 's technical performance comfort level paracentesis ; 2 . To improve adherence professional organization guideline determine fact improve clinical outcome ; 3 .

	<detailed_description>Since 2004 American Association Study Liver Disease ( AASLD ) well-established guideline management liver failure patient base expert review current literature . These guideline address initial evaluation patient admit hospital complication liver disease , include patient abdominal distention fluid accumulation . In many case , evaluation intraabdominal fluid , ascites , perform use paracentesis , procedure fluid withdrawn abdomen send laboratory analysis , indicate , result guide treatment . Despite guideline , remain significant variability practice among inpatient provider . The study begin chart review identify compliance , barrier , evidence-based recommendation . A baseline survey house-staff internal medicine department use identify knowledge base perceive barrier implementation best practice define AASLD . The house-staff subsequently divide three intervention group administration evaluation different teaching tool . A control group internet access AASLD guideline undergo teach already provide residency program . The second group receive baseline teaching , also receive pocket-card outline recommendation participate short , dedicated lecture reinforce guideline . The third group receive pocket card , lecture , pager number call individual education time case arise . The group follow period six month , participate exit survey reassessment knowledge perceive barrier , chart review conduct comparison data . The primary outcome subjective improvement practice base survey result . Secondary outcome measurement actual perceive benefit pocket card , lecture , individual education , determine knowledge base question survey , improvement patient clinical outcome base chart review note particularly 30-day readmission rate 90-day mortality .</detailed_description>
