	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit accordance inclusion exclusion criterion list . During screen process sensitivity n-propyl-thiouracil ( PROP ) evaluate classify subject `` non-tasters '' , `` taster '' , `` supertasters '' . Subjects within PROP class assign one two different grain product 'exposure ' group - Group 1 receive predominantly Whole Grain ( WG ) product Group 2 receive predominantly Refined Grain ( RG ) product ( ratio WG RG assignment 2:1 ) . For 6-week exposure period , subject receive weekly market basket grain product consist breakfast cereal , bread , snack item , side dish target provide whole grain level 50 % grain intake WG group ( current Dietary Guideline recommendation ) 15 % RG group ( current estimate intake U.S. adult ) . Before grain exposure , subject rate acceptability like numerous grain product . To accomplish , subject participate sensory evaluation test use product , provide information use validated questionnaire take implicit association test . During 6 week study period , subject record use market basket grain product , provide subjective score taste , convenience , nutrition , general liking . The quality total dietary intake assess use unannounced 24-h recall . Biological sample also collect subject . Blood urine sample collect evaluate risk factor chronic disease , biomarkers whole grain intake , fruit vegetable . Saliva fecal sample collect measure change gut microbiota measure metabolites bacterial fermentation . Breath hydrogen test conduct measure bacterial fermentation . Two week end intervention period , subject participate nominal group session identify significant barrier facilitator inclusion grain product diet . Follow-up visit 26 52 week , post-intervention , schedule subject re-evaluate acceptability , liking , variable related whole grain intake .</detailed_description>
