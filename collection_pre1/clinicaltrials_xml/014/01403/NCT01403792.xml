	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability intravaginal administration P2G12 . 11 subject receive P2G12/placebo . Three subject Group 1 receive 7mg P2G12 , placebo . Three subject Group 2 receive 14mg P2G12 , placebo five subject Group 3 receive 28mg P2G12 , placebo . A safety review take place subject Groups 2 3 receive study drug determine safe proceed next dose P2G12 . Vaginal cervical inspection perform determine effect , , study drug site administration .

	<brief_title>A Safety Study Of A Single Vaginal Administration Of P2G12 Antibody In Healthy Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study healthy woman age 18 50 year , involve vaginal application study drug P2G12 placebo . P2G12 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( kind protein ) , belong group MAbs help prevent protect HIV infection . Most MAbs produce use system call Chinese Hamster Ovary cell ( CHO-Cell ) fermentation , e.g . C2G12 . This method production expensive produce enough MAbs scale require global market . Unlike C2G12 , P2G12 manufacture plant . It hop plant manufacture MAbs may offer solution high cost low output CHO-cell fermentation . This study design confirm safety vaginally deliver MAb ( P2G12 ) derive plant manufacture Good Manufacturing Practice ( quality standard use manufacture medicinal product ) . 11 subject enrol consecutively cohort ( group ) ; successive cohort high dose study drug administer , well placebo . The dose range 7 28mg P2G12 saline . Subjects attend 7 visit 13 week . At visit 3 subject receive single administration study drug/placebo . Study visit include follow procedure : physical exam , vital sign , blood urine sample , cervical smear test colposcopy ( medical examination cervix ) . The relationship adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) P2G12 administration , abnormal laboratory test result compare baseline ( pre-dose ) value , determine safety P2G12 study . Levels P2G12 vaginal serum sample measure particular time-points order understand quickly P2G12 break body ( pharmacokinetics ) whether P2G12 absorb systemic circulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A female adult subject age 18 50 year old . They good health determine medical history , physical examination clinical judgement enter study . Subjects must agree abstain vaginal sexual intercourse 72 hour dose . Subject must agree undertake vaginal practice study participation receptive intercourse male , use sanitary tampon menses . Use condom without spermicidal agent encourage . Confirmation subject 's GP nothing subject 's medical history would prevent subject participate study . They know suspected ongoing vaginal disease , malignancy abnormality ( include nonmenstrual vaginal discharge ) discover time screen . They abnormality , nonmenstrual discharge note screen colposcopy . They present sample obtain screen visit : 1. positive result HIV 1 2 antibody . 2. positive result Hepatitis B sAg , antiHepatitis C antibody 3. positive syphilis serology 4. positive test Neisseria gonorrhoea Chlamydia trachomatis urine urethral swab sample 5. abnormal cervical smear cytology A clinically significant amount protein haemoglobin urine sample , determine urine dipstick . They receive form immunosuppressive immunomodulatory ( e.g . vaccine ) therapy past 6 month . They receive medication via vaginal route .</criteria>
