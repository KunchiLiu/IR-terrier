	<brief_summary>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) unique form accelerate plaque formation see coronary artery patient receive heart transplantation . It major cause morbidity mortality patient heart transplant . Little progress make characterize disease process , sophisticated imaging allow detailed analysis CAV , superior stratification transplant recipient possible early intervention perform necessary prevent mortality graft loss . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) novel image modality much high resolution Intra-Vascular Ultrasound ( IVUS ) . This study involve examine patient post-heart transplant use high-resolution imaging modality . It currently standard care patient post-heart transplant receive annual coronary angiogram close follow . Patients image use OCT time routine annual angiogram , re-imaged one year later time next annual angiogram earlier clinically indicate . The study goal well characterize CAV vivo OCT image try identify pattern disease , include intra-coronary risk assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Evaluate Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy ( CAV ) Patient 's Post Heart Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This descriptive , pilot study involve use Galectin 3 biomarker , Optical Coherence Tomography patient post-heart transplant suspect Cardiac allograft vasculopathy . This study involve image 100 patient different point time post heart transplant , various degree disease different lesion subtypes . Imaging take place time routine coronary angiogram , standard care patient population , clinically indicate . Additionally , patient re-imaged OCT next clinically indicated cardiac catheterization . A one-time blood draw take place one routine coronary angiogram visit . We attempt image 3 major epicardial coronary artery . In prior study use IVUS todetect CAV , yield significantly high multi-vessels imaged.21 , There one-time blood draw either baseline routine reimaging . A total 1 ml ( 5 tsps . ) blood collect store -80 freezer 1 year use research purpose . The tube label numeric code subject initial . Samples analyze Galectin 3 biomarker . Previously enrolled subject re-consented prior collect blood ample . Study Drugs Devices OCT intravascular light-based imaging modality measure intensity reflect light wave convert echo high-resolution tomographic image.24 It catheter-based invasive imaging system analogous IVUS use light oppose ultrasound generate vivo image coronary artery . It high resolution intravascular imaging modality , capable obtain detailed cross-sectional image coronary artery vivo resolution 10 um near histologic.24-27 This device , FDA approve intracoronary evaluation , use evaluate patient coronary artery disease , specifically plaque composition analysis , well proper stent deployment percutaneous intervention .</detailed_description>
