	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : 1. measure CERSR® ( Computerized Electrophysiological Reconstruction Spinal Regions ) electrical signal make muscle low back treatment low back pain , 2. study change take place muscle treatment . The device non-invasive mean nothing put body . The CERSR® pad adhesive ( sticky ) array ( ordered row ) electrode . The investigator hope find information quality muscle ' electrical signal reaction injury cause back pain , improve understanding nature back pain back injury . The investigator also hope improve treatment create simple test , tell u objectively ( computerized measurement ) whether treatment help .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Verium Diagnostics , Inc. , develop non-invasive device aid Physician diagnosis muscle disease muscle dysfunction . CERSR® ( Computerized Electrophysiological Reconstruction Spinal Regions ) , non-invasive diagnostic procedure `` Monitor display bioelectric signal produce muscle aid diagnosis prognosis muscular disease dysfunction . '' The technology capture electrophysiological data introduces reconstructive algorithm similar use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . The technology develop overcome problem associated surface EMG technology . SEMG limit resolution problem relate distance separate electrode muscle ( subcutaneous thickness ) , number location electrode apply , well limit minimum distance separate electrode , cross interference electrode pair . The CERSR® scan procedure monitor display bioelectric signal produce paraspinal neuromuscular system . A disposable large surface array 63 sensor ( 7 across x 9 ) place back , use T7 &amp; L4 landmarks . The array connect computer calibrate read neuromuscular activity cover electrode grid . Three scan capture software three different position : A ) Standing relaxed arm side ; B ) Body flexed hip 20° angle C ) Standing arm outstretched front hold 3 lb . weight hand . The electrophysiological information process highly proprietary imaging software program . The scan collect 1,953 bioelectric signal generate 96 muscle 60 nerve make paraspinal neuromuscular system , within two second result image reflect muscle recruitment pattern paraspinal region . The reconstructed physiological data present physician multitude readily interpret image low back data-inclusive report . The software translate registered activity color grid , slight activity represent blue red signifying intense contractility . Normal back musculature activity characterize centralize , symmetrical image pattern . Abnormal low back musculature activity characterize non-symmetric and/or multi-focal image signify abnormal muscular activity . In addition image , reflect recruitment muscle associate bioelectric signal , software develop calculate Root Mean Square voltage ( RMS ) electrode well mean entire electrode array . This Power Value increase bioelectric signal increase , decrease bioelectric signal decrease . The image associate Power Values aid Physician diagnosis prognosis muscle disease dysfunction . A previous clinical pilot study CERSR® technology use 201 subject without low back pain1 analysis data gather CERSR® methodology trial 161 healthy volunteer 44 acute low back pain patients2 , demonstrate : 1 . Persons acute onset low back pain abnormal EMG signal , reliably map use CERSR® technology 1 . 2 . The scan result generate CERSR normal subject ( low back pain ) , differs scan result normal subject ( low back pain present ) 1,2 , 3 . The abnormal EMG signal return normal medical treatment result resolution pain dysfunction 1 . 4 . Root Mean Square ( RMS ) value subject low back pain different RMS value normal pain-free subject 1,2 . The purpose propose study ass efficacy use CERSR® imagine technology 1 ) identify individual low back pain , 2 ) investigate whether use CERSR® technology successfully aid physician direct therapeutic regimen provide relief treated subject , 3 ) demonstrate CERSR® technology use track document progress success direct therapy regime . It believe use CERSR® methodology , result physician direct therapy investigate study , result significant cost saving reduce diagnostic procedure medical treatment related cost , short treatment length . CERSR® data serial scanning may also able compare baseline CERSR® result assist Physician determine Maximum Medical Improvements . The purpose research study 1. measure CERSR® ( Computerized Electrophysiological Reconstruction Spinal Regions ) electrical signal make muscle low back treatment low back pain , 2. study change take place muscle treatment . The device non-invasive mean nothing put body . The CERSR® pad adhesive ( sticky ) array ( ordered row ) electrode . The investigator hope find information quality muscle ' electrical signal reaction injury cause back pain , improve understanding nature back pain back injury . The investigator also hope improve treatment create simple test , tell u objectively ( computerized measurement ) whether treatment help .</detailed_description>
