	<detailed_description>The purpose trial evaluate difference PercuNav assist unassisted biopsy . The primary objective study assess quantify difference assist unassisted CT guide biopsy procedure liver respect radiation dose . The secondary objective study assess quantify difference assist unassisted CT guide biopsy procedure respect : - Total procedure time - Accuracy needle targeting ( distance define target PercuNav angle entry ) - Number needle pass - Target registration error ( TRE- distance `` virtual '' needle position ( track data ) actual needle position ( CT confirmation scan ) ) The study consist 50 patient 1 site . The expected completion time enrollment 3 month , depend ability clinic enroll patient . There two arm study . An Unassisted Biopsy Control arm ( physician patient blind needle position use PercuNav system ) Assisted Biopsy ( Physician blind needle position use PercuNav ) . Patients randomized arm . The PercuNav provide real-time , three-dimensional visualization navigation tool stag diagnosis surgery include pre-procedure plan intra-procedure navigation . PercuNav transforms two-dimensional patient image ( scan set ) , derive CT , PET/CT MRI dynamic representation tool navigate fused ultrasound . The system perform spatial map one image space another image space image space physical space ( registration ) allow physician correlate scan set patient . For trial , patient pre-procedure CT image set area interest . The image set display patient position biopsy perform , although requisite . Unassisted Biopsy - CONTROL GROUP ( Physician blind PercuNav system ) : The track device place patient 's skin desire point entry . Without display PercuNav screen physician , screen capture take record approach path . At point insertion , time stamp record start button press . Once physician state define target screen capture take PercuNav distance target time stamp record push start button . The final dose radiation display CT scanner record Case Report Form . Assisted Biopsy - STUDY GROUP : The track device place patient 's skin desire point entry . Without display PercuNav screen physician , screen capture take record approach path . The physician show PercuNav screen correct desire approach path another screen capture take . At point insertion , time stamp record start button press . Once physician state define target screen capture take PercuNav distance target time stamp record . The final dose radiation display CT scanner record Case Report Form . The primary study objective quantify , term point estimate confidence interval , treatment effect characterize mean difference number CT scan `` unassisted '' CT `` assist '' CT group guide liver biopsy procedure . More specifically , goal show 95 % Confidence `` assist '' CT procedure lead 3 few scan , average , `` unassisted '' CT group guide liver biopsy . H0 : uT - aT &lt; 3 scan HA : uT - aT &gt; = 3 scan uT = mean number scan `` unassisted '' CT procedure aT = mean number scan `` assist '' CT procedure Equivalently , desire superiority demonstrate whenever low 95 % confidence limit difference , `` unassisted '' CT minus `` assist '' CT , exceed 3 scan . Primary Endpoint Objective : The primary endpoint study number CT radiation exposure scan receive course CT guide liver biopsy procedure . The primary study objective characterize difference number scan receive `` assist '' `` unassisted '' CT group guide liver biopsy procedure . The primary measure assess quantified difference assist unassisted CT guide liver biopsy respect radiation dose . The secondary measure assess quantified difference assist unassisted CT guide procedure respect : - Total procedure time - Accuracy needle targeting ( distance define target PercuNav angle entry )</detailed_description>
