	<brief_summary>Several multicenter study show equivalence hypofractionated radiotherapy normofractionated radiotherapy breast-conserving surgery . However , treatment study carry conventional technique modern IMRT . Also evaluation quality life cosmetic outcome standardize . This study two-arm prospective study compare normofractionated hypofractionated radiotherapy patient breast cancer use tangential IMRT technique . The primary endpoint acute chronic cosmetic breast change . The secondary endpoint patient ' quality life . Patients include breast cancer 60 year old patient older tumour stage pTis-pT3 , pN0-pN1a , M0 breast-conserving surgery . Patients right side breast cancer stratify receive hypofractionated treatment course ( 40.05 / 2.67Gy 15 fraction ) leave side breast cancer normofractionated irradiation ( 50/2Gy 25 fraction ) . In arm , patient 60-69 year receive boost ( 16 Gy / 2Gy ) . In group , tangential intensity-modulated radiation technique aim achieve optimal dose homogeneity apply . Since high single radiation dose heart lead high morbidity and/or mortality , patient stratification accord diseased side adopt left-sided breast cancer patient would receive normofractionated 2Gy single dose . Therefore randomization . For classification grade adverse cosmetic event , `` Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC-AE V3.0 ) recognize LENT-SOMA score regularly document . Quality life document two standardized , validated questionnaire `` QLQ C30 BR23 '' EORTC ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ) . The questionnaire fill patient different time point study period . A sum grade III fibrosis , grade III telangiectasia grade II hyperpigmentation around 20 % expect 2 year . Therefore , calculation require number case base alpha 0.05 power 80 % maximal tolerable toxicity difference 15 % within 2 year result need recruit 226 patient ( 113 arm ) ( non-inferiority hypofractionated therapy ) .</brief_summary>
