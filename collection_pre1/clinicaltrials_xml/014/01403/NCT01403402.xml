	<detailed_description>The Congenital Muscle Disease Patient Proxy Reported Outcome Study ( CMDPROS ) longitudinal 10 year observational study identify care trend key care parameter adverse event congenital muscle disease use Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry ( CMDIR ) . The CMDIR register individual without genetic confirmation give clinical diagnosis congenital muscular dystrophy limb girdle spectrum , congenital myopathy late onset spectrum . The CMDIR currently translate 5 language : French , German , Spanish , English Portuguese plan add Chinese , Italian , Danish Japanese . Identifying care parameter adverse event rare genetic neuromuscular disease difficult . Care fragment , genetic confirmation may prioritize medical community cover medical insurance patient scatter globally potential challenge aggregate data across center . Natural history study currently launch . However , potential bias participation include recruitment less severely affected patient give difficulty travel secondary medically fragile condition . There currently treatment condition ; though optimize standardize care care delivery promote significant gain quality life survival . Identifying disease specific care parameter correlate parameter adverse event rate contribute development evidence base guideline inform clinically meaningful outcome future clinical trial . Study hypothesis : 1 . To use patient proxy report survey answer medical report build longitudinal care outcomes database across congenital muscle disease . 2 . To generate congenital muscle disease subtype specific adverse event rate correlate key care parameter . Primary outcome survival measure date birth date death . Primary outcome analyzed congenital muscle disease subtype maximal ambulatory status achieve . Secondary outcome include disease specific adverse event rate include rate hospitalization , rate antibiotic use , rate pulmonary infection , pneumothorax , atelectasis , aspiration adverse complaint include bloating , constipation , chest pain , dyspnea assess validated breathing assessment , vomit nausea difficulty eat . Patient proxy hospitalization , pneumothorax atelectasis report confirm obtain hospital discharge summary . Additional secondary outcome include ejection fraction ( relevance subtype specific ) , force vital capacity liter , weight , Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ) sleep apnea hypopnea index mean oxygen saturation REM total sleep study , age , gender , type treatment center location ( national referral center , tertiary care hospital , community hospital ) , gastrostomy tube , total number fracture Tscore/Zscore hip spine DEXA scan . Preliminary study may focus specific congenital muscle disease subtypes use retrospective data collection registry , survey monkey telephone interview assess adverse event rate last month last year limit recall bias . Prospective enrollment study participant 12 month assess monthly rate adverse event complaint . A preliminary study , CMD PROADE ( Patient Proxy Reported ADverse Event Rates ) plan 2 congenital muscular dystrophy subtypes : Collagen 6 Myopathy LAMA 2 Related CMD . De-identified data CMDIR make available IRB approve natural history study congenital muscle disease .</detailed_description>
