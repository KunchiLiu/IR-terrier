	<brief_summary>Beginning 2009-2010 season , influenza vaccine universally recommend child age 6 month 18 year old , place extra burden health care provider across U.S . The focus study develop new strategy implement exist evidence-based strategy enhance influenza immunization child . The intervention involve collaboration different type primary care provider , Colorado Immunization Information System ( CIIS ) , public health department visit nursing service ( VNA ) . It design implement involved delivery focus sustainability completion study . Parental input gather plan year focus group assist develop intervention . Qualitative assessment examination process first year implementation guide modification second implementation year order assure sustainability . Primary outcome measure intervention control group : 1 ) increase rate receipt ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 mo.-18 yr. 2 ) increase rate child 6 mo.-18 yr. fully immunize ( receive require influenza injection ) season . 3 ) measure outcomes age group ( 6 mo.-5 yr. , 6-8 yr. , 9-12 yr. , 13-18 yr. ) type clinical site ( urban Peds , urban FM , rural FM )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Within three type clinical site ( urban pediatric , urban family medicine , rural family medicine ) recruit group similar practice ( Year 1 ) 1a . Randomize practice within type clinical site either intervention control group 1b . Establish private-public collaboration influenza vaccination delivery county public health department , visit nursing association intervention practice within three clinical site type Specific Aim 2 : Conduct focus group among parent child see intervention practice , assess attitude perceive barrier possible practice-based collaborative strategy promote influenza vaccination ( Year 1 ) Specific Aim 3 : Develop ( Year 1 ) implement ( Years 2 3 ) plan comprehensive collaborative delivery influenza vaccine intervention practice 3a . Develop practice-based intervention strategy focus primarily immunization high-risk patient 3b . Develop private-public collaborative intervention intervention practice , county public health department visit nursing association focus primarily immunization school-aged child 3c . Implement ( Years 2 3 ) practice-based private-public collaborative strategy intervention practice monitor control practice Specific Aim 4 : Conduct group-randomized trial evaluate compare effectiveness comprehensive delivery model improve influenza vaccination coverage child 6 month 18 year three different type clinical site ( urban pediatric , urban family medicine , rural family medicine ) . 4a . Evaluate effectiveness comprehensive delivery model three type clinical site 1 . Compare follow primary outcome measure intervention control group : 1 ) increase rate receipt ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 month 18 year 2 ) increase rate child 6 month 18 year fully immunize ( receive require influenza injection ) season . 2 . Compare follow secondary outcome measure : 1 ) increase rate receipt ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among high-risk child 2 ) increase rate high-risk child fully immunize season . 3 . Evaluate sustainability comprehensive delivery model outcome measure 4b . Compare effectiveness comprehensive delivery model three different type clinical site ( urban pediatric private practice , urban family medicine private practice , rural family medicine private practice ) Specific Aim 5 : Evaluate process implementation comprehensive delivery model influenza delivery three type sit . 5a . Assess process measure relevant implementation practice-based intervention compare type clinical site 5b . Assess process measure relevant implementation private-public collaborative intervention compare type clinical site 5c . Using key informant interview , assess perception regard facilitator barrier private-public collaborative delivery , alternative method mean improving process among practice provider , administrator among participate public health visit nurse personnel Specific Aim 6 : In two urban pediatric intervention practice one rural family medicine practice , conduct survey examine parental attitude method influenza delivery experience practice 's participation comprehensive collaborative private-public model influenza delivery Major Hypotheses : SA4 . Hypothesis 1 . Effectiveness receipt ≥1 influenza vaccine : The increase likelihood receive ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 month 18 year great child intervention practice control practice . SA4 . Hypothesis 2 Effectiveness - fully immunize : The increase likelihood receive necessary influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 month 18 year great child intervention practice control practice . SA4 . Hypothesis 3 . Effectiveness age stratum : The increase likelihood receive ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child follow age stratum great intervention control practice : 1 ) 6 month 5 year ; 2 ) 6 8 year ; 3 ) 9 12 year ; 4 ) 13 18 year . SA4 . Hypothesis 4 . Effectiveness high-risk child : The increase likelihood receive ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among high-risk child 6 month 18 year great high-risk child intervention practice control practice . SA4 . Hypothesis 5 . Sustainability : The increase likelihood receive ≥1 influenza vaccine second post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 month 18 year great child intervention practice control practice . ( Sustainability also evaluate outcome . ) SA4 . Hypothesis 6 . Differential effectiveness clinical site type : The increase likelihood receive ≥1 influenza vaccine post-intervention year compare pre-intervention year among child 6 month 18 year intervention vs. control differ clinical site type</detailed_description>
