	<brief_summary>This pilot study use tissue fluid normally discard course total knee replacement surgery investigate potential sex difference knee osteoarthritis . Basic clinical demographic information obtain well preoperative functional pain assessment score , functional test , pressure pain threshold measurement . The purpose study investigate sex difference identify tissue investigate appear relationship difference functional score test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Analysis Potential Sex Differences Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine sex difference identify knee joint contribute difference incidence severity knee osteoarthritis observe men woman , particularly age 50 . Recent study assess response articular chondrocytes systemic factor suggest underlie difference biochemical molecular characteristic male female cell . It also know immune response differ male female , suggest may important difference level immune modulators joint tissue , include synovial membrane , synovial fluid , cartilage . Responses vitamin D metabolite 1_,25 ( OH ) 2D3 upregulated osteoarthritic cartilage , raise possibility male female differ circulate level vitamin D , content vitamin D metabolites synovial tissue , ability cell respond steroid . Similarly , post-menopausal woman , circulate estrogen reduce relative testosterone , know might impact knee . Most importantly , know potential sex difference correlate severity disease . This study base hypothesis sex difference exist different tissue knee joint , contribute increase incidence severity knee osteoarthritis old woman compare old men . To test hypothesis , investigator use tissue fluid normally discard course total knee replacement surgery investigate potential sex difference .</detailed_description>
