	<brief_summary>Long-term study emphasize depressive symptom episodes account majority illness burden experienced individual bipolar disorder ( BD ) . Previous study show blood level proteins call pro-inflammatory cytokine abnormal individual bipolar depression . The investigator hypothesize prevent production release pro-inflammatory cytokine result improvement depressive symptom individual bipolar depression . Minocycline medication inhibits activation immune cell ( i.e . microglia ) brain reduces production pro-inflammatory cytokine . Treatment minocycline show antidepressant-like effect animal study improve symptom individual schizophrenia . In study , minocycline ( 100 mg twice day ) administer 8 week determine efficacious antidepressant individual bipolar depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy Adjunctive Minocycline Treatment Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder ( BD ) associate high-rate non-recovery , recurrence , inter-episodic dysfunction . Depressive symptom episodes dominate longitudinal course BD differentially account overall illness burden . During past decade , substantial development make pharmacological psychosocial treatment bipolar mania maintenance , relatively treatment proven efficacious bipolar depression . The absence explanatory disease model bipolar disorder limit development evaluation genuinely novel agent bipolar disorder . Several line evidence implicate inflammatory system consequential causative mood disorder . Bipolar disorder mark alteration inflammatory cytokine ( e.g . TNF-alpha , IL-6 ) . Moreover , pro-inflammatory activation healthy medically ill individual associate disturbance affective , cognitive , somatic function . The clinical use cytokine-based therapy demonstrate induce and/or intensify affective symptomatology non-psychiatric medical patient . Conventional pharmacological treatment ( e.g . lithium ) bipolar disorder affect production pro-inflammatory cytokine well gene expression . The encompass aim study herein develop novel treatment bipolar depression base model disease pathophysiology . Minocycline semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline , exert anti-inflammatory effect distinct antimicrobial property . Minocycline potent inhibitor microglial activation decrease expression pro-inflammatory cytokine , chemokines receptor suppress activity matrix metalloproteinases . Minocycline show exert antidepressant-like property preclinical study . Rats treat minocycline monotherapy well combination treatment antidepressant ( desipramine ) exhibit significantly improve performance force swim test . Adjunctive minocycline show efficacious treatment schizophrenia double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study . Subjects receive minocycline exhibit significant improvement negative symptom well global improvement measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . Significant improvement also note measure executive function , include executive function composite score , spatial recognition memory , cognitive planning , intradimensional/extradimensional set shifting . A total 40 individual age 18 65 meeting DSM-IV-TR criterion current major depressive episode part bipolar I II disorder enrol 8-week , open-label study adjunctive minocycline ( 100 mg every 12 hour ) .</detailed_description>
