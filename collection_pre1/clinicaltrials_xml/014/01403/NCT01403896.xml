	<brief_summary>Stem cell transplant healthy donor patient combat blood cancer disorder . This process call stem cell transplantation . Stem cell normally live bone marrow . A bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) bone marrow directly transplant patient . However , stem cell also stimulate move bone marrow blood collect , process call mobilization . When stem cell transplant call peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) . Both stem cell source use different reason , PBSCT much common . There considerable debate stem cell source , BMT PBSCT , optimal . There differences two source important transplant outcome . The stem cell product transplant , also call stem cell graft , contain stem cell . Results study suggest variation cell graft may account variation outcomes . Preliminary data recent study conduct Canadian Blood Bone Marrow Transplant Group associate relative frequency particular cell population leukemic relapse another important outcome call graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . While later essentially equate failed transplant , former common devastate complication stem cell transplantation . The drug use mobilize stem cell blood health donor collection G-CSF . However new mobilization drug recently approve call plerixafor . This drug able mobilize stem cell G-CSF fail pre-clinical study suggest may produce superior stem cell graft G-CSF alone . There little information available , besides safety efficacy data , effect plerixafor stem cell graft normal healthy donor . This study compare stem cell graft normal healthy donor follow plerixafor mobilization versus plerixafor G-CSF mobilization . Specifically , look cell population previously correlate important transplantation outcome like relapse GVHD . The investigator suspect stem cell graft mobilize plerixafor G-CSF provide superior graft mobilize plerixafor alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthy Donor Study II - Comparing Plerixafor With G-CSF Plerixafor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) involve transfuse stem cell collect 3 potential source : bone marrow , peripheral blood , umbilical cord . There 2 major type transplantation . Autologous SCT involve transplant patient stem cell , allogeneic transplantation involve transplant stem cell someone else . Whatever source , transplant stem cell product call graft . Currently , common source peripheral blood , However , considerably debate optimal stem cell source different source associate different transplant outcome . One key outcome graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This common complication SCT contribute significantly transplant morbidity mortality , well relapse . Stem cell normally populate bone marrow . Drugs use encourage stem cell go peripheral blood , process call mobilization . In peripheral blood stem cell collect subsequently transplant . In Canada , drug use mobilize stem cell donor filgrastim , form granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) . Although well tolerate , shortcoming agent clearly room improve term donor experience provide optimal stem cell graft . A soon complete study conduct Canadian Blood Bone Marrow Transplant Group ( CBMTG ) , call CBMTG 0601 , evaluate best stem cell source . The study aim compare outcome allogeneic transplant patient receive either G-CSF stimulate bone marrow peripheral blood . This seminal study provide valuable information optimal stem cell source allogeneic SCT . Early result suggest investigator may able predict important SCT outcome , transplant related mortality , relapse graft versus host disease , look cell population graft . Plerixafor new mobilization agent approve use combination neupogen myeloma relapse lymphoma undergo autologous SCT . Following numerous publication safety dose plerixafor , 2 pivotal high quality study perform patient population . The result study lead FDA approval , Health Canada approval close . Plerixafor may clinically superior mobilize agent Neupogen . More importantly though , formidable safety profile arguably superior respect . There also case report trial demonstrate safety efficacy plerixafor healthy donor well . Finally , preclinical work suggest plerixafor mobilization may yield superior graft . Taken together , work support notion plerixafor may superior mobilization agent neupogen . Rationale : Considering shortcoming neupogen demonstrate potential plerixafor trial autologous SCT patient , would logical investigate efficacy plerixafor normal healthy donor allogeneic SCT . The investigator confidently state plerixafor safe . Furthermore , plerixafor mobilize myeloma lymphoma patient fail neupogen mobilization . However , although suggested preclinical data , firm evidence suggest plerixafor mobilization provide superior stem cell graft . The investigator administer either plerixafor plerixafor neupogen compare cell population peripheral blood bone marrow.. Importance : The use SCT steadily increase last 20 year . This especially increase since use neupogen mobilize stem cell thereby make transplant easier . Now new agent available likely safer perhaps efficacious , use may improve donor experience patient outcomes . If plerixafor graft consist cell population associate superior transplant outcome determine CBMTG 0601 , likely use upcoming large clinical trial compare neupogen plerixafor normal healthy donor . Objectives : Our primary objective determine best time harvest stem cell normal donor give plerixafor without neupogen . A secondary objective evaluate compare change time plerixafor without neupogen administration population cell graft predict give superior transplant outcome . The secondary objective evaluate compare change time plerixafor without neupogen administration concentration cell PB BM normal donor predict give GVHD relapse . The investigator hypothesise plerixafor neupogen provide graft increase cell population associate superior SCT outcome .</detailed_description>
