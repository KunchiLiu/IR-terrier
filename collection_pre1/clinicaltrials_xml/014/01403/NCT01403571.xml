	<brief_summary>Canadian statistic indicate incidence obesity increase occurrence diabetes obese individual 5-fold great healthy weight , make weight control population particularly relevant . Preliminary clinical data show whole grain , Salba , may improve type 2 diabetes control , reduce after-meal blood glucose , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor suppress appetite . Its use may therefore potential implication long-term weight management , improve diabetes . The objective research ( weight loss ) evaluate whether add Salba energy reduce diet six month result great weight loss compare control overweight obese individual type 2 diabetes . The study recruit 77 overweight obese individual type 2 diabetes . They instruct follow calorie restrict diet regular diabetes therapy together regular exercise . Participants randomly assign receive 30 g Salba/1000 kcal daily energy requirement , oat bran control supplement match energy . The effect supplement weight-loss ( include waist circumference , % body fat ) glucose control ( A1c , fast glucose level ) assess . In addition , relate outcome low-grade body inflammation , hunger-regulating hormone ( ghrelin , adiponectin ) , safety measure ( urea , creatinine , ALT prothrombin time ) satiety score evaluate . Modest weight loss associate improved glucose control individual type 2 diabetes . Addition Salba energy reduce diet may facilitate great weight loss improve glycemic control CVD risk factor compare diet alone . Salba may also promote maintenance weight loss therefore help prevent weight gain provide feeling fullness reduce appetite . In light high incidence obesity individual diabetes , Salba grain may useful addition diet .</brief_summary>
