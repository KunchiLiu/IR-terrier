	<brief_summary>This phase I-II multicenter , open label study previously untreated elderly patient ( &gt; 60 year ) CLL , include 2 section : Induction phase Chlorambucil Lenalidomide ( CL ) : - Phase 1 : non-comparative phase aim define MTD lenalidomide give combination chlorambucil efficacy safety lenalidomide chlorambucil combination ; - Phase 2 : non-comparative phase aim define overall response rate lenalidomide give MTD combination chlorambucil . Maintenance versus clinical observation : -A comparative phase include lenalidomide clinical observation aim defining benefit lenalidomide give maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chlorambucil + Lenalidomide Lenalidomide Maintenance Untreated Elderly With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive six monthly course chlorambucil ( C ) lenalidomide ( L ) schedule consist 8 day C ( d1-d8 ) combine L give daily response assessment take place 12 week start ( d+1 ) course VI , patient continue treatment lenalidomide daily . In first phase induction phase study dose L give C gradually escalate reach MTD . In second phase induction phase , C give combination Maximum Tolerated Dose L ( either MTD maximum plan dose 10mg ) . Patients achieve response 6 course CL induction phase -PR , CRi , CR MRD negative CR- eligible post-induction phase study . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) , stratify accord quality response ( PR v CR , CRi , MRD-CR ) genetic profile ( 11q , 17p- , p53mut v ) , receive L daily , ( L arm ) therapy ( Clinical observation arm ) day 364 PD unacceptable toxicity develop , whichever occur first . During maintenance ( L arm ) , L give dose tolerated patient period interval d+28 6th course CL day evaluation response ( d+84 start 6th course CL ) . At screen , blood sample draw physical examination , CT scan thorax radiography abdomen ultrasound , bone marrow biopsy aspirate perform . A clinical examination carry blood sample harvest weekly CL treatment . Twelve week start ( d+1 ) 6th CL course ( d+84 ) , clinical response assess . During post-remissional phase , monthly clinical examination perform patient . Patients randomize receive L maintenance therapy additional blood examination treatment . Eight week completion post-remissional phase ( d+420 ) , new response assessment perform ( physical examination blood sample , CT scan thorax radiography abdomen ultrasound , bone marrow biopsy aspirate ) . Thereafter , patient monitor response duration least follow 18 month .</detailed_description>

Diseasefree prior malignancy CLL ≥3 year , exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' cervix breast . Able take low molecular weight heparin alternative , lowfixeddose warfarin , alternative , lowdose aspirin . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Female subject childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must : Understands potential teratogenic risk unborn child need effective contraception ; Be capable comply effective contraceptive measure . Be inform understand potential consequence pregnancy need notify study doctor immediately risk pregnancy . Understand need commence study treatment soon study drug dispense follow negative pregnancy test . Uderstand need accept undergo pregnancy test base frequency outline protocol . Contraception . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) enrol protocol must agree use two reliable form contraception simultaneously practice complete abstinence heterosexual contact follow time period relate study : 1 ) least 28 day start study drug ; 2 ) participate study ; 3 ) dose interruption ; 4 ) least 28 day study treatment discontinuation . The two method reliable contraception must include one highly effective method one additional effective ( barrier ) method . FCBP must refer qualified provider contraceptive method need . The following example highly effective additional effective method contraception : Highly effective method : 1 . Intrauterine device ( IUD ) 2 . Hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) 3 . Tubal ligation 4 . Partner 's vasectomy Additional effective method : 1 . Male condom 2 . Diaphragm 3 . Cervical Cap Because increase risk venous thromboembolism patient multiple myeloma take lenalidomide dexamethasone , combine oral contraceptive pill recommend . If patient currently use combine oral contraception patient switch one effective method list . The risk venous thromboembolism continue 4 6 week discontinue combined oral contraception . The efficacy contraceptive steroid may reduce cotreatment dexamethasone . Implants levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system associate increased risk infection time insertion irregular vaginal bleeding . Prophylactic antibiotic consider particularly patient neutropenia . Pregnancy test . FCBP must two negative pregnancy test prior start study drug . The first pregnancy test must perform within 10 14 day prior start study drug second pregnancy test must perform within 24 hour prior start study drug . FCBP must agree medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 week include 4 week end study treatment , except case confirm tubal sterilization . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . Females must agree abstain breastfeed study participation least 28 day study drug discontinuation . Male patient must : Understand potential teratogenic risk engage sexual activity pregnant female female childbearing potential . Must practice complete abstinence agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential participating study , dose interruption least 28 day follow study drug discontinuation , even undergone successful vasectomy . If pregnancy positive pregnancy test occur partner male study patient study participation , investigator must notify immediately . Female male patient : instruct never give medicinal product another person return unused capsule study doctor end treatment .
