	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety effectiveness investigational procedure treat people treatment resistant bipolar depression . Precise dose delivery radiation predetermine target brain accomplish known Cyberknife stereotactive radiosurgery methods.. This technology consider noninvasive ( physically invade body ) . We study Cyberknife influence sensitivity certain nerve brain . Although many clinical treatment psychiatric condition do use stereotactive radiosurgery , present study experimental , seek use moderate dos radiation intend destroy brain cell , normalize modulate function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiosurgical Neuromodulation Refractory Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective : To determine safety Radiosurgical Neuromodulation ( RSN ) Refractory Depression use X-rays population subject severe treatment resistant bipolar depression 12-month observational period post treatment . While almost radiosurgical device could use , research team extensive experience Accuray CyberKnife System , K011024 , use planning delivery 6MV X-ray treatment study . Participation dependent upon subject diagnosis bipolar depression meeting criterion treatment resistance . Treatment resistance define failure show clinical improvement least four different medication trial and/or one course ECT current episode . A medication trial define adequate dose duration one four class psychoactive medication : lithium , anticonvulsant mood stabilizer , atypical antipsychotic mood stabilizer , and/or antidepressant medication . One course ECT define receive six acute treatment . The study include subject fail ECT , intolerable side effect ECT , elect receive treatment due stigma , concern possible side effect ECT treatment . The subject enrol exhausted reasonable treatment strategy , currently reasonable viable treatment option illness . Secondary objective : To examine clinical outcome initially 3 month , follow 6 , 9 12 month . Depression assess use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) 24 item , manic symptom measure use Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , Clinical Global Impression Severity illness ( CGI-S ) , Improvement ( CGI-I ) . A battery neuropsychological test administer well , assess memory California Verbal Learning Task ( CVLT ) , prefrontal function use DKEFS battery include DKEFS Sorting task , DKEFS Trails task , DKEFS color-word interference task , DKEFS verbal fluency task . In addition , investigator request information regard possible adverse event occur trial . The intend use CyberKnife System , radiosurgical device use research study , administer radiomodulaton cingulate cortex target Cg25 patient refractory bipolar depression .</detailed_description>
