	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose temsirolimus give together dexamethasone , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , pegaspargase treat young patient relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Temsirolimus may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , pegaspargase work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving temsirolimus combination chemotherapy may effective treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose temsirolimus administer weekly 2 dos combination intensive re-induction chemotherapy child relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . II . To define describe toxicity temsirolimus combination intensive re-induction chemotherapy child relapse ALL NHL administer schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare minimal-residual disease ( MRD ) level present end induction historical control patient relapse ALL NHL bone marrow involvement disease . II . To determine complete remission ( CR ) rate patient ALL NHL receive regimen . III . To evaluate responsiveness patient ALL cell mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibition use vitro vivo pharmacodynamic assessment response ALL blast temsirolimus . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study temsirolimus . Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-5 15-19 ; mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-2 ; temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 8 ; vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; pegaspargase IV 1 hour day 3 17 . Some patient may also receive methotrexate intrathecally ( IT ) 72 hour prior day 1 day 8 . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
