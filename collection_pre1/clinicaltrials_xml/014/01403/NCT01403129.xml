	<brief_summary>Keratoconus ( KC ) corneal disease many case ultimately require corneal transplantation maintain vision . Early detection , possible current technology , would allow early treatment prevent severe damage KC corneas inadvertently operate upon correction vision . Our aim combine measurement different property cornea develop mean early detection KC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Keratoconus common degenerative disease affect cornea . As keratoconus develop , cornea thins bulge . Eventually , corneal transplant may need maintain vision . In early stage , disease particularly difficult detect . This great importance corneal refractive surgeon surgical treatment keratoconic cornea weaken greatly accelerate occurrence symptom . Early detection keratoconus benefit patient recent development method strengthen corneal stroma prevent disease progression . The investigator develop technique base use high resolution ultrasound image cornea measure thickness component layer , include epithelium stroma . In early keratoconus , anterior stromal surface begin bulge forward , epithelium thin apex bulge thicken around , maintain smooth anterior surface . The investigator also develop method characterize elastic property cornea induce measure surface displacement response pulse acoustic radiation force . Our goal reduce percentage screen case deem keratoconus-suspect least factor two allow unambiguous diagnosis early keratoconus . This would provide two major benefitsÍ¾ ( 1 ) able predict eye high risk develop ectasia corneal refractive surgery , ( 2 ) early diagnosis would allow earlier treatment condition collagen crosslinking , preserve cornea disease progression .</detailed_description>
