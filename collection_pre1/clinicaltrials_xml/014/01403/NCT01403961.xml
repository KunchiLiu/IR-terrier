	<brief_title>Hemoglobin A1c Immediate Postsurgical Complications Diabetes Type 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diabetes highly prevalent disease patient undergo evaluation previous surgery . The efficient glucose control , patient diabetes type II , reduce risk microvascular complication . Diabectic patient underwent scheduled cardivacular noncardiovascular surgery show increase rate immediate long-term complication . The frequent complication infection , cardiovascular event death . Intensive insulinisation cardiovascular surgery reduces risk new coronary event immediate post surgery . No study find show evaluation Hemoglobin A1c value surgery immediate post surgery complication . A poor glycemic control associate large number chronic complication like diabetic neuropathy , nephropathy , retinopathy infection disease . The Hemoglobin A1c use like marker glycemic control last 120 day correlation enzyme glicosilation . This marker could relation complication program surgery . This study evaluate incidence complication immediate post operatory patient diabetes type II relation hemoglobin A1c surgery . If hemoglobin A1c correlation incidence cardiovascular complication , could mark change therapeutic measure prior program surgery .</detailed_description>
