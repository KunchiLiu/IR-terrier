	<brief_summary>DNA vaccine consist small piece DNA also known plasmid , several potential advantage traditional vaccine . Thus far , DNA vaccine appear well tolerated human . The investigator develop DNA vaccine , INO-3401 , include plasmid target protein H5N1 avian influenza virus . The vaccine deliver via electroporation ( EP ) use CELLECTRA constant current device deliver small electric charge follow injection , since animal study show delivery method increase immune response vaccine . The vaccine give 30 healthy adult subject participate study FLU-001 . It hypothesize booster dose INO-3401 + EP well tolerate immunogenic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use DNA plasmid contain gene express viral antigen may promise way formulate vaccine effectively prevent infection disease cause H5N1 avian influenza virus . Plasmid vector simple construct easy manufacture relatively low cost . Vaccination plasmids express influenza proteins induce development serum antibody might also induce significant quantity secretory IgA antibody and/or CMI . The DNA sequence include vaccine could also result proliferation T lymphocyte could broaden effectiveness vaccine include variant strain H5N1 antigenically modify HA ( i.e. , drift strain ) . Electroporation ( EP ) technology transmembrane electrical field apply increase permeability cell membrane create microscopic pathway ( pore ) thereby enhance uptake drug , vaccine , agent target cell . Their presence allow macromolecule , ion , water pas one side membrane . The presence constant field influence kinetics directional translocation macromolecular plasmid , plasmid delivery vivo sufficient achieve physiological level secrete protein . Intradermal ( ID ) injection plasmid follow EP use successfully deliver therapeutic gene encode variety hormone , cytokine , enzyme variety specie . EP currently use human deliver cancer vaccine therapeutic well gene therapy . The expression level increase much 3 order magnitude plasmid injection alone . The use EP via CELLECTRAÂ® device increase expression H5N1 influenza virus gene INO-3401 DNA vaccine .</detailed_description>
