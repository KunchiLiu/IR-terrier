	<brief_summary>Malaria common , decreasing , cause fever endemic area . The use rapid diagnostic test could improve treatment malaria local community level . Deployment test , however , considerable cost . The aim study evaluate effect improve treatment fever use Community Health Workers Afghanistan . In phase I study , hypothesis RDT diagnosis deploy standard training support improve accuracy treatment apply fever community health worker compare diagnosis base symptom alone . In Phase II study , hypothesis accuracy treatment improve additional training supportive intervention give community health worker compare standard training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cluster Randomised Trial Malaria RDTs Used CHWs Afghanistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cluster randomise trial conduct 22 clinic ( cluster ) two province Afghanistan . Clinics Afghanistan number community health worker ( CHWs ) resident village near clinic . The clinic provide supply drug item ( e.g . family plan intervention ) CHW provide range service community include treatment acute episodes fever . Currently , CHW way diagnose malaria , except base presenting sign symptoms patient . With method likely many patient malaria , fever , treat antimalarial drug patient malaria likely treated antimalarial drug . The use Rapid Diagnostic Tests ( RDT ) malaria could potentially provide CHW easy safe way diagnose malaria base presence absence parasites blood . However , use test straightforward . They need apply correctly , follow strict protocol , accurate . There much interest widespread deployment tool recommend World Health Organisation fever patient malaria endemic area . However , evidence effectiveness use CHWs patchy randomise trial conduct Asia . Since represent considerable cost , examination effectiveness require . In Asia ( unlike Africa ) , malaria cause two specie - Plasmodium vivax account majority case P. falciparum minority . Treatments differ specie differ drug resistance pattern . Therefore accurate diagnosis important provide accurate treatment different type malaria also treatment case fever malaria alternative treatment . In area health service restrict short opening hour , insecurity , inaccessibility due distance terrain , CHW able use RDTs apply correct treatment positive negative test village level . This study randomise 22 clinic ( constituent CHWs ) receive either RDT use CHW diagnose malaria patient fever , intervention ( current situation ) CHWs base treatment decision symptoms alone ( i.e . parasite base diagnosis ) . The RDT group give standard national training use RDTs management malaria standard supply . The non-RDT arm training management malaria short introduction RDTs . The study measure accuracy treatment apply CHW RDT vs. non-RDT arm , examine accuracy RDT apply field operational condition . The accuracy measure collect filter paper blood spot patient test PCR malaria . A variety comparison make two group , main aim measure difference accurate treatment patient accord reference ( PCR ) diagnosis . In phase II study non-RDT arm discontinue clinic re-randomised different intervention . One group clinic standard RDT roll continue , previously , second group get additional training range supportive intervention assist practice . The second phase use method assess study outcome . The aim second phase see whether additional training ( cost ) result improved practice CHWs .</detailed_description>
