	<brief_summary>The present trial randomize , placebo-controlled study evaluate 3 different dos PXT3003 patient CMT1A disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II , Randomized , Placebo-controlled Trial Patients With Charcot-marie-tooth Disease Type 1A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In addition safety tolerability treatment , clinical , electrophysiological biological endpoint ( PMP22 mRNA , skin biopsy histology plasma biomarkers ) assess . Standard laboratory test drug plasma concentration also measure . Because slow progression disease nature observe symptom , minimum duration 12 month treatment require order observe potential improvement efficacy parameter .</detailed_description>
