	<brief_title>Trial Eribulin Patients Who Do Not Achieve Pathologic Complete Response ( pCR ) Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open-label trial evaluate 6 cycle eribulin female patient invasive breast cancer achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) treatment standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen surgery . Patients randomize three cohort accord tumor-type : triple-negative ( Cohort A ) , hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative ( Cohort B ) , HER2-positive ( Cohort C ) tumor . Patients receive eribulin 6 cycle ( 1 cycle = 21 day ) . Patients HER2-positive tumor also receive trastuzumab ; patient Cohort B receive locoregional radiotherapy and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy per institutional guideline . Up 148 patient planned enrollment .</detailed_description>
