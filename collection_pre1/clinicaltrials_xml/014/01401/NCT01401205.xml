	<brief_title>The Predictor Respiratory Discomfort After Shoulder Arthroscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During shoulder arthroscopic surgery , extravasation irrigation fluid occur around shoulder trachea , compress upper airway . Although extravasation generally reabsorb asymptomatically within 12 hour , case lead reintubation life-threatening complication . An endotracheal tube reliable method secure airway airway obstruction shoulder arthroscopy surgery . However , since airway may become obstructed extubation , airway patency verified extubation . Direct visualization larynx trachea use laryngoscopy bronchoscopy difficult due presence tracheal tube . A cuff leak around tracheal tube cuff-deflated condition suggest predictor successful extubation . However , reliability question adult patient . A cuff leak could affect paratracheal pressure , think elevate shoulder arthroscopy . In recent study , show laryngeal ultrasound reliable , non-invasive method evaluation laryngeal morphology predict post-extubation stridor . The investigator apply upper airway ultrasonographic examination focus measurement upper airway diameter patient undergo shoulder arthroscopic surgery evaluate change upper airway anatomy surgery . The investigator also try find finding ultrasonographic examination could reliably predict dyspnea airway compression extubation . The investigator try compare ultrasonographic finding chest radiograph validate measurement ultrasonographic examination . A cuff leak test preform evaluate ability predict upper airway obstruction shoulder arthroscopic surgery .</detailed_description>
