	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) one common life-threatening inherited disorder affect 1/35000 individual US . In past decade , median predict survival CF patient increase significantly 10-12 37 year ( 1 ) . One major factor contribute increase survival understanding role optimal nutrition overall health status individual CF . Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) currently best predictor pulmonary health CF , malnutrition person age CF negative impact lung function rapid yearly decline FEV1 . Recent data Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ( CFF ) patient registry United States Canada analyze determine whether association exist pulmonary function measure FEV1 Body mass index ( BMI ) age . BMI-for-age percentile value &gt; 50th percentile associate well-preserved lung function low value BMI associate incrementally low value FEV1 ( 2 ) . Thus , CFF recommend child CF age 2 20 year maintain BMI a≥50th percentile age sex . However , several publication demonstrate fat free muscle ( FFM ) waste evident even individual BMI &gt; 50th percentile , unknown whether BMI percentile adequately reflect change body composition group patient ; therefore , BMI might best marker indicate optimal nutritional status . Limitations BMI marker optimal Nutrition : fat mass versus muscle mass In individual CF , BMI use assess appropriateness weight height age sex . Since strong association BMI overall health metric , especially lung health , CFF recommend child CF maintain BMI ≥50th percentile age sex . However , apparent loss skeletal muscle may occur CF patient retain normal body weight , indicate BMI provide information body compartment may fail detect subtle alteration body composition . Although several epidemiologic study show CF patient maintain BMI &gt; 50th percentile improve lung function survival , recent data indicate preserve FFM instead BMI may impact overall survival CF ( 7 ) . Because variability level fat mass fat-free mass , many combination fat mass index FFM index associate BMI , weight-height index need carefully interpret . Because high level BMI-for-age associate substantial increase fat mass , BMI useful measure obesity . In chronic inflammatory disease , change regional fat distribution observe shift central fat distribution . The latter associate increase low-grade chronic inflammation , insulin resistance , cardiovascular risk ( 8 ) . Therefore , BMI good index assessment obesity otherwise normal child , adequate sufficient CF population . In summary , pediatric patient CF may decrease Fat-free Mass Index ( FFMI ) well preserve BMI ≥50th percentile . Conversely , patient might BMI &lt; 50th percentile normal FFMI associate overall well-being . Current practice force CF patient consume high fat caloric nutrient maintain BMI &gt; 50th percentile incur cost cause anxiety , stress , daily struggle family potential increase pro-inflammatory state due central fat accumulation . The outcome propose study contribute understand relationship BMI , muscle waste marker health wellbeing . If study demonstrate well maintain FFMI rather BMI correlate well good health status CF , may result change current nutrition practice CF national even international level .</detailed_description>
