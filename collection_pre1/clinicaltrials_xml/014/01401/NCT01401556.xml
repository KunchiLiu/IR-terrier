	<brief_summary>The objective propose research improve quality care old outpatient present Emergency Departments Fracture Clinics osteoporosis-related wrist upper extremity fracture . Although patient warrant evidence-based guideline-recommended osteoporosis test treatment , numerous study demonstrate treatment rate less 10-20 % year post-fracture . Several trial , include investigator prior study , try address osteoporosis care-gap report various multifaceted intervention ( combination patient physician education , guideline , physician reminder ) modestly improve treatment rate compare usual care , although 60-70 % patient exposed intervention still remain untreated . The investigator believe case-manager ( identifies independently see patient clinic , arrange bone mineral density [ BMD ] test , offer guideline-based treatment low BMD ) represent potential solution hold great promise . The investigator hypothesize osteoporosis case-manager effectively efficiently increase rate osteoporosis treatment old outpatient upper extremity fracture compare documented effective cost-saving multifaceted intervention . To test hypothesis investigator propose pragmatic patient-level randomize controlled comparative effectiveness trial blind outcomes ascertainment compare case-manager strategy multifaceted intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To improve treatment osteoporosis old patient upper extremity fracture . Background : Osteoporosis cause low bone mass skeletal fragility lead fracture hip , spine , upper extremity cause pain , deformity , disability , even death . It affect 2 million old Canadians cost u billion dollar year . Guidelines recommend aggressive treatment old patient osteoporosis-related fracture risk another fracture 20 % within 1-year bisphosphonate treatment reduce fracture risk 50 % . Unfortunately , less 10 % old outpatient treat osteoporosis year post-fracture even effective multifaceted intervention test far ( i.e. , combination patient education physician guideline reminder ) increase post-fracture osteoporosis treatment rate bisphosphonates 22 % . Proposed Strategy : Osteoporosis case-managers identify old fracture patient Emergency Departments Fracture Clinics ; arrange bone mineral density ( BMD ) test ; meet patient counsel go result ; offer prescribe bisphosphonate treatment low BMD . Hypothesis : An osteoporosis case-manager effectively efficiently increase rate BMD test bisphosphonate treatment old high-risk patient upper extremity fracture compare previously test effective cost-saving multifaceted osteoporosis intervention ( active-comparator control consist telephone-based education patient treatment guideline reminder family physician ) . Specific Aims : To determine whether osteoporosis case-manager strategy : 1 . Increase rate osteoporosis treatment multifaceted intervention 2 . Increase rate BMD test multifaceted intervention 3 . Be cost-effective compare either multifaceted intervention usual care Study Design : Randomized control comparative effectiveness trial blind ( allocation-concealed ) ascertainment outcome compare case-managers multifaceted intervention . Eligible patient 50 year old upper extremity fracture already treat bisphosphonates , recruit Emergency Departments Fracture Clinics . Primary outcome proportion start bisphosphonates within 6-months . Secondary outcome include BMD testing , osteoporosis treatment , appropriate care . Case-managers expect increase bisphosphonate treatment rate 43 % ( achieve pilot trial ) v publish multifaceted intervention rate 22 % . With alpha=0.05 , beta=0.9 , 10 % attrition rate , total minimum required sample size 240 patient . Using 1-year outcome micro-costing data trial publish Markov decision analytic model osteoporosis quality improvement intervention , incremental cost effectiveness case-manager compare multifaceted intervention usual care . Major secondary outcome include long-term treatment persistence , examine question ( e.g. , 80 % persistence rate case-manager vs 50 % persistence multifaceted intervention ) require sample size least 360 patient .</detailed_description>
