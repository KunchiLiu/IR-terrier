	<brief_title>Atrial Flutter Ablation With Contact Therapy Cool Path Ablation System Along With EnSite Velocity Contact System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center non-randomized study . All enrol patient meet eligibility criterion receive ablation therapy typical atrial flutter use Contact Therapy™ Cool Path™ Cardiac Ablation System . Historical data publish ( PMA P060019 Cool Path ) , report ( IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo ) publish literature Atrial Flutter RF ablation study use determine performance goal primary study endpoint derive sample size . In addition , follow analysis perform study 1 . Validation ECI conventional method assess tip tissue contact 2 . Ancillary analysis ass relationship ECI study outcome . Subjects undergo two follow visit day 10 month 3 post procedure . The following assessment perform visit : - ECG - Query regard adverse event since last visit - Assessment anti-arrhythmic anti-coagulation medication - Query regard recurrence repeat ablation typical atrial flutter</detailed_description>
