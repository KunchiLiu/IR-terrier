	<brief_title>Treatment Strategy Refractory Schizophrenia : Drug Interaction Between Clozapine Fluvoxamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Schizophrenia one severe mental illness . The prevalence schizophrenia variously report range 1 1.5 percent . More 50 % patient described poor outcome , repeat hospitalization , exacerbation symptom , episode major mood disorder , suicide attempt . Schizophrenia costly medical care , treatment rehabilitation , reduce lose productivity . Therefore , development effective treatment schizophrenic patient important issue . The classical antipsychotic drug dopamine receptor antagonist , effective treatment schizophrenia , particularly positive symptom . Even treatment typical antipsychotic , 50 % schizophrenic patient lead severely debilitated life . Second , classical antipsychotic drug associate annoy serious adverse effect . Clozapine virtually psychopharmacological choice patient schizophrenia either response typical neuroleptic experience severe extrapyramidal side effect consequently tolerate medication . There patient respond clozapine , need treat severely ill patient frequently compels clinician adopt therapeutic innovation lack sound empirical basis . One strategy combination various somatic treatment clozapine . Recently , investigator conduct preliminary open trial evaluate safety efficacy fluvoxamine coadministration clozapine refractory schizophrenic patient . The mean plasma clozapine level obtain clozapine 100 mg/day plus fluvoxamine 50 mg/day close produce 300-mg/day clozapine monotherapy one previous study . The combined treatment well tolerate , clinical improvement observe patient . And concomitant fluvoxamine could attenuate clozapine-induced weight gain metabolic disturbance . However , effect fluvoxamine safety therapeutic efficacy clozapine need clarify double-blind study . Methods This study three-year proposal . Sixty treatment-resistant schizophrenic inpatient participate project . The subject randomize one two parallel group : clozapine monotherapy clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment . The double-blind active treatment consist two period . The measure clinical efficacy Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale , Clinical Global Impression , Nurses'Observation Scale Inpatient Evaluation . The measure side effect Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale UKU Side Effect Rating Scale . Fasting serum sample collect determine lipid profile ( total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL , LDL ) , glucose level , insulin level . Plasma level clozapine , norclozapine , clozapine N-oxide determine high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection . The following result expect : 1 . In treatment-resistant schizophrenic patient , global antipsychotic effect clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment superior clozapine monotherapy . 2 . Clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment less adverse effect clozapine monotherapy . 3 . The effect clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment body weight metabolic disturbance superior clozapine monotherapy . 4 . Steady-state plasma level clozapine metabolites account proportion variance clinical effect .</detailed_description>
