	<brief_summary>The objective study assess quantify difference assist ( use real-time visualization track cryo-probes ) unassisted cryoablation procedure use pre-procedure CT scan CT fluoroscopy respect : Primary Endpoint : â€¢ `` TRE '' Target Registration Error ( distance `` virtual '' needle position ( track data ) actual needle position ( CT confirmation scan ) ) Secondary Endpoints - Accuracy needle target - The vector needle insertion ( The initial vector allow u project path pre-defined target . If initial entry point ideal , path target need adjustment ) Based two-sample t-test ( significance level 0.05 , two-tailed ) , study 89 % power detect difference 2mm accuracy two treatment group ( assume standard deviation 1.9mm ) . - Measure time difference assist unassisted procedure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study assess quantify difference assist ( use real-time visualization track cryo-probes ) unassisted cryoablation procedure use pre-procedure CT scan CT fluoroscopy . To assess , physician perform ablation procedure without Percu Nav device . Data collect angle needle entry unassisted assisted PercuNAv determine add image information modifies physician 's needle approach . Each patient pre-procedure CT image set area interest acquire . The patient scan position ablation perform , although requisite . Sterile registration patch apply patient 's skin around area interest prior scan , ensure suitable window leave available needle entry . The patient undergo pre-procedural scan part usual clinical evaluation lesion undergo ablation . The scan may acquire without contrast , discretion physician . Control group : The physician perform procedure use standard care method ( CT ) , without additional information record PercuNav device . The track device place patient 's skin desire point entry . Without display PercuNav screen physician , screen capture take record approach path . At point insertion , time stamp record start button press . Once physician state define target screen capture take PercuNav distance target time stamp record push start button . At end procedure verification CT scan take needle place send PercuNav . Percu Nav group : The physician perform procedure use standard care procedure additional information display record PercuNav device ( CT PercuNav ) . The track device place patient 's skin desire point entry . Without display PercuNav screen physician , screen capture take record approach path . The physician show PercuNav screen correct desire approach path another screen capture take . At point insertion , time stamp record start button press . Once physician state define target screen capture take PercuNav distance target time stamp record . At end procedure verification CT scan take ( part regular standard care procedure ) needle place send PercuNav . The outcome measure evaluate group include : 1 . Accuracy - The distance `` virtual '' needle position ( track data ) actual needle position ( CT confirmation scan ) ) , applicable ( TRE ) 2 . Time reach clinically acceptable target tumor 3 . The total procedure time 4 . Accuracy needle target - The vector needle insertion ( The initial vector allow u project path pre-defined target . If initial entry point ideal , path target need adjustment )</detailed_description>
