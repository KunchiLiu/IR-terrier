	<detailed_description>This study conduct use traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design . Enrollment least 3 subject plan dose cohort . The decision expand cohort dose escalate base occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) Cycle 1 consider Investigator related ( possibly probably ) ASP3026 . The Safety Data Review Committee may elect enroll additional subject cohort evaluate dose level . Each cycle include 28 day continuous dose ASP3026 . Treatment ASP3026 may continue one discontinuation criterion meet . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) define high dose ASP3026 dosing schedule &lt; 33 % subject experience DLT Cycle 1 . The MTD low dose , determine Safety Data Review Committee , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . Twelve additional patient treat RP2D evaluate safety tolerability .</detailed_description>
