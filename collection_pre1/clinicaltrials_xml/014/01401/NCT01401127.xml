	<brief_summary>People Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) like take part sport exercise , problem metabolism blood glucose control make difficult . Some people T1DM administer insulin via insulin pump , also know continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) therapy , background basal level insulin constantly infuse skin special pump , bolus dose insulin give accompany food . Clinical experience suggest may particularly useful manage diabetes exercise , limited experimental evidence support . The aim research , divide three part , investigate hypothesis physiological response sub-maximal ( moderate ) exercise person type 1 diabetes treat CSII , make approximate closely physiological response healthy individual prior reduction basal insulin infusion rate . This first part research design compare metabolic response exercise people without diabetes people T1DM run insulin pump usual basal rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Managing Insulin Pumps Exercise - Study 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For first part study , participant either people type 1 diabetes treat insulin pump therapy volunteer without diabetes . The 2 group match far possible age , body mass index usual level activity . Participants attend exercise laboratory 2 occasion . On first occasion , take place time day , formal write consent obtain participation study . Participants undergo measurement maximal exercise capacity ( VO2 MAX ) . On second occasion attend 2 hour lunch contain 60 gram carbohydrate ( advice give achieve ) . A cannula insert arrival blood sample obtain . Arterialised sample obtain use heated hand technique . Once cannula inserted participant type 1 diabetes ask reduce basal insulin infusion rate insulin pump 70 % normal end study visit . After 30 minute set blood sample obtain , participant start exercise 1 hour 50 % VO2 MAX . A set blood sample obtain end hour exercise . Participants rest 30 minute final set blood sample take . At point cannula remove study visit end . Participants diabetes give choice return basal insulin infusion rate normal point . A snack offer . Blood glucose monitor every 10 minute also participant feel symptom hypoglycaemia . If hypoglycaemia occurs protocol stop carbohydrate give blood glucose level return normal range .</detailed_description>
