	<detailed_description>This randomize , multicenter , 2-way crossover study subject 12 year old perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) evaluate patient preference , satisfaction efficacy ciclesonide nasal aerosol versus mometasone aqueous nasal spray . A novel patient-administered assessment , develop validated measure patient satisfaction preference intranasal corticosteroid ( INCS ) treatment allergic rhinitis ( AR ) , utilized study . Subjects randomize 1 2 treatment sequence : Sequence 1 : Treatment Period 1 = ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 mcg daily two week ; Treatment Period 2 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg daily two week Sequence 2 : Treatment Period 1 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg daily two week ; Treatment Period 2 = ciclesonide Nasal aerosol 74 mcg daily two week</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Give write informed consent and/or assent ( appropriate ) , include privacy authorization well adherence concomitant medication withhold period , prior participation . Male female 12 year old prior screen Subject must general good health ( define absence clinically relevant abnormality determine investigator ) base screen physical examination , clinical laboratory result , medical history . A documented history PAR relevant perennial allergen ( house dust mite , cockroach , mold , animal dander ) minimum two year immediately precede screen . The PAR must sufficient severity require treatment ( either continuous intermittent ) past , require treatment INCS throughout entire study period . At least one treatment PAR 6 month prior expect randomization , 14 day , nasal spray . A demonstrated sensitivity least 1 allergen know induce PAR ( house dust mite , animal dander , cockroach , mold ) base document result standard skinprick test either within 90 day prior screen perform screening . A positive test define wheal diameter least 3 mm large negative control wheal skinprick test . The subject 's positive test allergen must consistent medical history PAR allergen must present subject 's environment throughout study . Based upon subject 's medical history , investigator 's judgment , subject unlikely seasonal allergy exacerbation study . Subject , female â‰¤ 65 year age , must negative serum pregnancy test prior screen Females childbearing potential must instruct agree avoid pregnancy study must use acceptable method birth control : An oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , implantable contraceptive , transdermal injectable contraceptive least 1 month prior enter study continue use throughout study 30 day follow completion study ; Barrier method contraception , eg , condom and/or diaphragm spermicide participate study ; Abstinence . The subject must possess degree understand write English , opinion investigator , enable complete study participation Female subject pregnant lactating . History physical finding clinically significant nasal pathology , include nasal polyp respiratory tract malformation ; recent nasal biopsy ; nasal trauma ; nasal ulcer perforation . Clinically insignificant finding may allow , investigator 's judgment , finding unlikely impact : safety efficacy INCS : subject 's perception treatment INCS . Surgery atrophic rhinitis rhinitis medicamentosa within last 60 day prior screen Presently nasal jewelry , nasal piercing , history nasal surgery ( eg , rhinoplasty , septoplasty ) trauma nasal cavity . Subject , investigator 's judgment , seasonal exacerbation prior screen Participation investigational drug trial within 30 day prior screen , participation previous study involve ARTSP instrument , plan participation another investigational drug trial time study . A known hypersensitivity corticosteroid component formulation ciclesonide mometasone . History respiratory infection disorder ( include , limited , bronchitis , pneumonia , influenza , severe acute respiratory syndrome [ SARS ] ) within 14 day prior screen History alcohol drug abuse within 2 year prior screen History positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. Active asthma require treatment inhale systemic corticosteroid and/or routine use beta agonist controller drug ( eg , theophylline , leukotriene antagonist , etc . ) ; intermittent use ( less equal three us per week ) inhale shortacting betaagonists acceptable . Use shortacting betaagonists exerciseinduced bronchospasm allow . Expected use disallow medication study period . Expected initiation immunotherapy study period plan dose escalation study period . However , initiation immunotherapy 90 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose ( 30 day ) may consider inclusion . Nonvaccinated exposure active infection chickenpox measles within 21 day prior screen Expected initiation pimecrolimus cream 1 % great tacrolimus ointment 0.03 % great study period plan dose escalation study period.However , initiation creams/ointments 30 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose study period may consider inclusion . Study participation clinical site employee and/or immediate relative reside household . Study participation one subject household . Have follow condition judge investigator clinically significant and/or affect subject 's ability participate clinical trial : impaired hepatic function include alcohol relate liver disease cirrhosis , history ocular disturbance , eg , glaucoma posterior subcapsular cataract systemic infection hematological , hepatic , renal , endocrine ( except control diabetes mellitus postmenopausal symptom hypothyroidism ) disease , gastrointestinal disease , malignancy ( exclude basal cell carcinoma , current neuropsychological condition without drug therapy Any condition , judgment investigator , would preclude subject complete protocol completion assessment write . Any use mometasone nasal spray within 3 month prior screen Any prior use ciclesonide nasal aerosol .</criteria>
