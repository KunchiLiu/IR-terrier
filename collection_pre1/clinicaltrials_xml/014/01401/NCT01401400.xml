	<brief_summary>Background rationale Chronic hepatitis B common cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide . ( 1 ) Antiviral therapy oral nucleoside analogs interferon reduce viral load hepatic necroinflammation , may reduce risk hepatocellular carcinoma cirrhotic complication . ( 2-4 ) Peginterferon direct antiviral immunomodulatory effect . The advantages drug include finite course treatment lack drug resistance . However , require subcutaneous injection carry side effect . Besides , 30 % 40 % treated patient sustain response treatment . ( 5-8 ) To reduce cost side effect treatment , important predict patient respond peginterferon . Genetic host study peginterferon response provide lot knowledge interaction host virus induce immune control , also outside set immune modify therapy . Recently , genome wide association study ( GWAS ) identify genetic polymorphism IL28B gene show associated treatment response interferon ribavirin patient chronic hepatitis C. ( 9-12 ) The polymorphism also associate natural clearance hepatitis C virus . Whether phenomenon applies patient chronic hepatitis B unclear . Furthermore , response conventional interferon show decrease risk hepatocellular carcinoma prolong survival . ( 13 ) Virological serological response PEG-IFN durable substantial proportion patient 3 year follow-up ( 14 ) , whether treatment benefit sustain period amount clinically meaningful result unknown . To date , GWAS predict response peginterferon chronic hepatitis B patient perform . Polymorphisms gene IL28B identify GWAS use assess chance response treatment select patient high probability response peginterferon . We aim perform GWAS chronic hepatitis B patient previously treat peginterferon identify polymorphism gene associate response treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Study Peginterferon Treatment Hepatitis B Patients : The GIANT-B Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For GWAS stage study , cohort study conduct compare hepatitis B patient response ( see definition ) versus patient achieve response ( peg ) interferon treatment . Replication SNPs identify GWAS perform independent cohort patient similar characteristic , treat ( peg ) interferon . A large independent cohort peginterferon treat HBV patient already identify guarantee replication cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion History chronic hepatitis B , define presence positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) least 6 month . History treatment ( per protocol outside study ) standard interferon ( alfa2a alfa2b ) , peginterferon alfa2a peginterferon alfa2b least 12 week . A followup duration least 24 week last dose ( peg ) interferon . Use nucleos ( ) ide analogues prior combine ( peg ) interferon treatment allow . Available HBV DNA HBeAg status baseline , end treatment end followup ( 24 week end treatment ) Written informed consent obtain . Exclusion criterion Coinfection hepatitis C virus , delta virus human immunodeficiency virus . Use immunosuppressant , chemotherapy systemic corticosteroid ( prednisolone 30 mg daily equivalent 7 day ) ( peg ) interferon treatment 24week pre posttreatment period .</criteria>
