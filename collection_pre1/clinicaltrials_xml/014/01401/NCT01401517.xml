	<brief_title>Phase IIa : Safety , PK , &amp; Tolerability Sodium Nitrite Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease-SONIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) manifestation systemic atherosclerosis strong predictor cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality . The systemic disease atherosclerosis patient result arterial stenosis artery supply muscle low extremity . During exercise , stenoses limit ability increase blood flow , lead oxygen supply/metabolic demand mismatch , bio-energetic deficit , subsequent muscle contractile dysfunction . Thus , primary pathophysiology PAD related limitation blood flow abnormal hemodynamics ( reduce tissue perfusion pressure blood flow ) low limbs exercise . Patients PAD commonly present symptom intermittent claudication ( IC ) , often described patient cramp , ache , fatigue sensation calf muscle legs occurs physical activity . Notably , symptom claudication pain due exercise-induced ischemia muscle leg , cause significant limitation functional exercise capacity adversely affect quality life . Sodium nitrite investigate potential new therapy improve function patient PAD . The overall goal dose-ranging study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , tolerability , potential biological activity multiple dose oral sodium nitrite patient PAD . As described , primary pathophysiology PAD related limitation blood flow low extremity , result limited exercise tolerance decrease quality life . PAD highly prevalent patient diabetes , lead poor outcome accelerate disease progression compare non-diabetic counter-parts . A common feature patient group endothelial dysfunction , decrease NO bioavailability , depletion NO store , find may compound PAD diabetic condition coexist . Sodium nitrite inorganic salt find metabolized vivo . At physiological concentration , sodium nitrite know cause vasodilation , feature enhance hypoxic ischemic environment . The nitrite anion act NO reservoir readily convert active NO non-enzymatic reaction deoxyhemoglobin , make unique candidate potential therapeutic effect ischemic tissue . Accordingly , study design ass safety tolerability sodium nitrite well pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationship sodium nitrite two different dos versus placebo . Sodium nitrite 's effect endothelial function , marker NO bioactivity , measure functional walking capacity also assess .</detailed_description>
