	<detailed_description>With advance antiretroviral therapy , life expectancy HIV-infected individual continue improve old individual represent rapidly grow proportion infect . However , despite improved life expectancy , substantial residual morbidity remain treated HIV include increase rate neurocognitive dysfunction , frailty , cardiovascular disease . As condition also increase normal age , HIV often think risk factor `` early '' `` accelerate '' age . Prior study generally focus HIV-specific factor risk neurocognitive dysfunction , frailty , cardiovascular disease , examine extensively risk factor find significant condition general population . The investigator hypothesize effect age HIV synergistic rate non-AIDS morbidity . While correlate risk factor non-AIDS morbidity young individual may largely related HIV , old individual sustain virologic control , traditional risk factor neurocognitive disease , frailty , cardiovascular disease contribute significantly disease HIV-specific risk factor . Our primary objective : 1 . Define prevalence incidence neurocognitive dysfunction , frailty , cardiovascular disease well-defined cohort age virologically suppress HIV-infected individual . 2 . Identify correlate risk factor prevalent incident neurocognitive dysfunction , frailty , cardiovascular disease . 3 . Compare contrast identify correlate risk factor co-morbidities interest older ( &gt; 50 year old ) young HIV-infected individual .</detailed_description>
