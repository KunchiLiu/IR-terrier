	<brief_summary>In 2005 , The University Alabama Birmingham establish NIDDK-funded , interdisciplinary center excellence PKD-related research , specific emphasis recessive PKD . In previous Core Center award period , develop Core Resource capture clinical mutational data ARPKD patient ( `` Core A : ARPKD Clinical Genetic Resource '' , NCT00575705 ) . However , study last several year demonstrate ARPKD single gene disorder characterize renal cystic disease extra-renal phenotype share numerous pathogenic feature . In current competitively- renewed Center , expand Core resource include hepato/renal fibrocystic disease . Goals Core A : The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource : 1 . - Clinical Database : â€¢ Expand comprehensive Clinical Database include information patient meet inclusion criterion hepato/renal fibrocystic disease . 2 . - Mutational Database : - Test child ARPKD hepato/renal fibrocystic disease identify genetic mutation , establish DNA bank patient hepato/renal fibrocystic disease develop Mutational Database . This Database capable link clinical mutational information via unique identifier searchable format facilitate genetic research ( e.g . genotype-phenotype correlation , new disease gene study , modifier gene study ) , translational study , clinical trial . 3- Tissue Resource : - Much research perform disease kidney , include recessive genetic disease , require human tissue affect well non-affected ( control ) individual . In Core Resource , establish independent tissue resource would supply investigator throughout North America sample hepato/renal fibrocystic disease affect tissue study disorder . 4- Educational Resource : - Expand multi-media , web-based resource provide reliable up-to-date , comprehensive informational resource ARPKD Hepato/Renal Diseases family , physician , genetic counselor . All information regard participation `` Core A : The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource '' available : http : //www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The entry portal Core A design physician contact CLIA-certified UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory ( MGL ) request information PKHD1 test patient/parent/legally authorize representative look information online hepato-renal disease include study direct UAB Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Disease Translational Resource website http : //www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/ . The Informed Consent Clinical Database Information participant post website ( http : //www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/ ) review potential participant follow-up discussion PI and/or Research Nurse Coordinator . In addition , material paper format send interested potential participant upon request . Two key element require patient enrollment : 1 ) certification inform consent obtain , 2 ) participant physician contact information form complete participant . The UAB release information form , information physician instruction enter data post website available physician . This study provide free genetic testing . Clinical genetic test available via UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory ( CLIA CAP approve ) fee-for-service . In special case ( eg . present old age , mainly liver pancreatic disease ) contact Dr. Guay-Woodford lgw @ uab.edu . Once receipt requisite item confirm , follow action proceed : 1 . Each participant assign unique code identifier database clinician-specific web field open participant identifier . 2 . The participant/parents confirm name clinician database notify physician and/or genetic counselor ( clinician ) intent participate study . 3 . The clinician access Physician Link website follow instruction post data website . Once do , name patient delete online database unique identifier use . Each clinician permit access website track login procedure include process verify enter system . Clinical data provide participant 's physician web-based entry system , cod unique identifier , enter secure Clinical Database initial visit data ( F01 primary data form ) annual follow ( F11 follow form ) . Data entry last duration study . No names initial collect data form , gender date birth ( convert age month year keep file ) request . The physician receive monetary incentive enter data . 4 . Blood sample diagnostic testing ( signed clinical genetic test consent ) send UAB MGL . The UAB MGL perform standardized fee service test PKHD1 mutation . The clinical result report patient 's physician/genetic counselor . As need , genetic counseling service make available UAB Department Genetics ( fee service ) . 5 . Blood sample research purpose come directly research lab patients/families sign study consent agree DNA extraction/EBV transformation/or . Adult child participant need two tsp blood infant need one tsp blood . 6 . This study provide free genetic testing . Clinical genetic test available via UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory ( CLIA CAP approve ) fee-for-service . The result genetic testing enter Mutational Database participant representative provide consent participate Database . 7 . Our center notify directly local physician authorize patient patient contact center directly donate hepato/renal fibrocystic disease tissue . The research coordinator contact possible participant/parent/legally authorize representative discus study willingness participate research . If study consent sign , research coordinator call center/pathologist , send sample provide instruction prepare ship sample . On arrival Dr. Guay-Woodford 's lab , sample de-identified cod participant 's unique identifier transport UAB Tissue Collection Banking Facility .</detailed_description>
