	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct control clinical trial U.S. Army soldier train become combat medic . The purpose study determine 11-week , high intensity exercise program target low back muscle use specialized equipment result 25 % increase low back muscular strength endurance compare low intensity general core stability exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Low back injury responsible large percentage non-battle injury theater operation large contributor non-expiration active service attrition US Armed Forces . Weakness poor endurance back muscle associate low back injury . Targeted , high intensity exercise approach use specialized equipment develop strength endurance `` weak link '' muscle group ( lumbar extensor ) show reduce risk low back injury high-risk civilian worker , widely implement military setting . Objective/Hypothesis Specific Aim : In controlled clinical trial , investigator assess effectiveness high intensity progressive resistance exercise training program target lumbar extensor improve lumbar extensor muscular strength endurance US Army soldier . Hypothesis : A high intensity progressive resistance exercise lumbar extensor result 25 % increase lumbar extensor muscular strength endurance compare control follow 11-week intervention . Study Design A mixed method , two-arm , control clinical trial cluster randomization conduct . The sampling frame soldier train become combat medic one domestic US Army base . Soldiers randomly assign ( platoon ) one two intervention - experimental control . All participant give platoon receive intervention intervention carry US Army base , addition soldier ' usual physical fitness training program . Participants randomize experimental group ( strengthen exercise ) perform lumbar extensor muscle progressive resistance exercise use standardized protocol . Exercise training consist 1 set high intensity progressive resistance exercise lumbar extensor specialize equipment . Participants active comparator control group ( stabilization exercise ) perform 5 minute low intensity core stabilization exercise floor . Interventions carry 1X/week 11 week . Outcome measure utilized test hypothesis Aim 1 include validate physical fitness test lumbar extension muscular strength endurance . Fitness test conduct baseline follow 11-week intervention period . Relevance Soldiers prepare deployment need advance technology help improve optimize functional capacity lumbar extensor muscle . Assuming positive result study confirmatory trial , implementation target exercise protocol maximize resilience soldier high risk low back injury , thereby help become physically fit counteract extreme physical demand require combat .</detailed_description>
