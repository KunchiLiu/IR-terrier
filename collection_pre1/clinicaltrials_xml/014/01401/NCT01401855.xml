	<brief_summary>This study investigate usefulness optical probe differentiation thyroid cancer normal thyroid tissue thyroidectomy specimen . This next step research team conduct prior Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) H-28135 , investigator successfully demonstrate use optical probe reading thyroid specimen ex vivo could successfully discriminate benign malignant disease . The Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy ( ESS ) probe also IRB approve clinical trial conduct vivo Boston University/Boston Medical Center Dr. Satish Singh Dr. Irving Bigio . The investigator intend bring project clinical set thyroid disease . The optical real-time reading compare histological analysis area . Subjects already undergo thyroid biopsy thyroid disease include thyroid nodule , thyroid cancer thyroid goiter nodule eligible participate . During already schedule thyroid procedure use fine needle aspiration biopsy needle , optical reading take thyroid gland area analyze usual standard fashion . The reading correlate histological result . In addition , lymph node biopsied part evaluation also test prior histological standard processing . All specimen data de-identified data collection analysis complete . Our goal use optical real-time reading improve differential diagnosis benign malignant thyroid nodule avoid surgery purpose diagnosis alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Thyroid cancer common endocrine malignancy . The current gold standard , fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy , yield approximately 10-25 % indeterminate result , lead patient undergo thyroidectomy diagnosis . Elastic scatter spectroscopy ( ESS ) new , minimally invasive optical-biopsy technique , mediate fiber-optic probe , sensitive cellular sub-cellular morphological feature . We assess potential incorporate ESS probe 23-gauge needle biopsy use preoperative trans-cutaneous biopsy thyroid differentiate benign malignant thyroid nodule . Methods : We design build miniaturize ESS probe fit 23-gauge biopsy needle test IRB-approved protocol 34 patient undergoing ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy thyroid nodule endocrine clinic . ESS data collect conduct biopsy use optical 5 repetitive reading three distinct location within thyroid nodule . Using cytology gold standard , spectral analysis compare benign malignant thyroid nodule . For indeterminate cytology , final post-surgery pathology tissue use comparison .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects undergo thyroid biopsy thyroid nodule , thyroid cancer , thyroid goiter nodule . Only patient require sample establish standard care criterion already schedule undergo biopsy clinical purpose undergo optical biopsy time physical biopsy . Subjects nodules small 1 cm , infectious disease , medication ( coumadin ) may interfere optical reading</criteria>
