	<brief_summary>Postoperative acute kidney injury ( AKI ) still one serious complication thoracic aortic surgery , incidence 8 50 percent . Postoperative AKI significantly increase morbidity mortality patient undergo thoracic aortic surgery . Previous study AKI DHCA report confound result due different criterion AKI . Therefore , investigator try evaluate incidence risk factor AKI thoracic aortic surgery accord diagnostic criterion stag system AKI report acute kidney injury network . The investigator also try develop risk model score system AKI evaluate performance risk model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significant improvement morbidity mortality achieve last three decade since develop deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) . However , postoperative acute kidney injury ( AKI ) still one serious complication thoracic aortic surgery , incidence 8 50 percent . Postoperative AKI significantly increase morbidity mortality patient undergo thoracic aortic surgery . Previous study AKI DHCA report confound result due different criterion AKI . Therefore , investigator try evaluate incidence risk factor AKI thoracic aortic surgery accord diagnostic criterion stag system AKI report acute kidney injury network ( 2007 ) . The investigator also try develop risk model score system AKI evaluate performance risk model .</detailed_description>
