	<brief_summary>Some patient prostate cancer benefit androgen deprivation therapy reduces level testosterone . Leuprolide synthetic Luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) analogue upon administration decrease testosterone level ≤0.5 ng/mL . Leuprolide Acetate 22.5 mg Depot microencapsulated formulation leuprolide release slowly time effectively reduce testosterone level many patient ≤0.5 ng/mL three month . In study Leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg Depot administer intramuscular injection twice period 6 month . The proportion patient testosterone ≤0.5 ng/mL evaluated period 168 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main selection criterion : Patients histologically documented prostate cancer might benefit medical androgen deprivation therapy ( i.e. , reduction androgen level ) consider enrollment study meet follow criterion : 1 . Males ≥18 year age 2 . Patients histologically document prostate carcinoma might benefit medical androgen deprivation therapy . 3 . Life expectancy least 1 year . 4 . WHO/ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 5 . Adequate renal function Screening define serum creatinine ≤1.6 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) clinical laboratory . 6 . Adequate stable hepatic function define bilirubin ≤1.5 time ULN transaminase ( i.e. , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase ) ≤2.5 time ULN clinical laboratory Screening . 7 . Ability comprehend full nature purpose study , include possible risk side effect ; ability cooperate investigator comply requirement entire study . 8 . Following receipt verbal write information study , patient must provide sign informed consent study related activity carry . 1 . Evidence brain metastasis , opinion investigator , take account medical history , clinical observation , symptom ( rationale : minimize possibility serious acute flare reaction would necessitate concomitant administration drug ) . 2 . Evidence spinal cord compression , opinion investigator , take account medical history , clinical observation , symptom ( rationale : see rationale criterion 1 ) . 3 . Evidence severe urinary tract obstruction threaten urinary retention , opinion investigator , take account medical history , clinical observation , symptom ( rationale : see rationale criterion 1 ) . 4 . Presence tumor immediate vicinity could cause spinal cord compression , opinion investigator , take account medical history clinical observation ( rationale : see rationale criterion 1 ) . 5 . Excruciating , severe pain extensive osseous deposit , take account medical history , clinical observation , symptom ( rationale : see rationale criterion 1 ) . 6 . Testosterone level &lt; 1.5 ng/mL Screening , This testosterone level locally determine laboratory clinical site ( rationale : ensure patient normal baseline testosterone level ) . 7 . Previous androgen ablative therapy last 6 month , LHRH analogue ( e.g. , Leuprolide acetate , Goserelin , Buserelin ) antagonists ( degarelix ) . Also , therapy must occur within 12 month screen visit . Any prior ADT must exceed 6 month therapy . 8 . Previous treatment androgenreceptor blocker , Bicalutamide , Flutamide , Megestrol acetate , Ciproterone allow 3 month washout prior screen visit ( rationale : therapy alter patient 's androgenic hormonal response sustain period ) . 9 . Previous orchiectomy , adrenalectomy , hypophysectomy ( washout allow ) ( rationale : therapy could alter patient 's androgenic hormonal response ) . 10 . Previous prostatic surgery ( e.g. , radical prostatectomy , transurethral resection prostate ) within 2 week Baseline ( rationale : therapy could alter patient 's androgenic hormonal response and/or adverse reaction profile ) . 11 . Previous local therapy primary tumor curative attempt surgery ( external beam radiotherapy , brachytherapy , thermotherapy , cryotherapy ) within 2 week Baseline ( rationale : therapy could alter patient 's adverse reaction profile ) . 12 . Previous cancer systemic therapy chemotherapy , immunotherapy ( e.g. , antibody therapy , tumor vaccine ) , biological response modifier ( e.g. , cytokine ) . 13 . Any investigational drug within 5 halflives physiological action 3 month , whichever longer , Baseline ( rationale : prevent adverse effect another drug attribute study drug prevent potential interaction ) . 14 . Administration 5αreductase inhibitor ( Finasteride , Dutasteride ) within 3 month Baseline ( rationale : alters PSA level androgen metabolism prostate cell ) . Prior use 5αreductase inhibitor allow 3 month washout . 15 . Overthecounter alternative medical therapy estrogenic antiandrogenic effect ( i.e. , PCSPES , saw palmetto , Glycyrrhiza , Urinozinc , dehydroepiandrosterone ) within 3 month Baseline . 16 . Hematological parameter ( red blood cell , total differential white blood cell count , platelet count , hemoglobin , hematocrit ) outside 20 % ULN low limit normal clinical laboratory Screening ( rationale : render potential study drugrelated laboratory abnormality easier observe ) . 17 . Coexistent malignancy , opinion investigator ( rationale : decrease possibility diseasecaused associate therapycaused adverse effect attribute study drug ) . 18 . Uncontrolled congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction coronary vascular procedure ( e.g. , balloon angioplasty , coronary artery bypass graft ) significant symptomatic cardiovascular disease ( ) within 6 month Baseline ; rest uncontrolled hypertension ( ≥160/100 mm Hg ) symptomatic hypotension within 3 month Baseline ( rationale : decrease possibility diseasecaused associate therapycaused adverse effect attribute study drug ) . 19 . Venous thrombosis within 6 month Baseline ( rationale : influence testosterone level may associate increase likelihood deep venous thrombosis ) . 20 . Uncontrolled diabetes , opinion investigator ( rationale : patient uncontrolled diabetes need compensate metabolic disorder treatment LHRH analogue ) . 21 . History drug and/or alcohol abuse within 6 month Baseline ( rationale : patient likely numerous medical abnormality unlikely comply protocol ) . 22 . Serious concomitant illness ( e ) disease ( ) ( e.g. , hematological , renal , hepatic , respiratory , endocrine , psychiatric ) may interfere , put patient additional risk , ability receive treatment outline protocol ( rationale : decrease possibility diseasecaused associate therapycaused adverse effect attribute study drug ) . 23 . Patients anticoagulative therapy include warfarin ( Coumadin® ) , Dabigatran Etexilate ( Pradaxa® ) heparin . Those patient lowdose , lowmolecular weight heparin may enrol study ( rationale : decrease possibility diseasecaused associate therapycaused adverse effect attribute study drug ) . Plavix Aspirin allow cardiac prophylaxis long inclusion/exclusion criterion meet concern coagulation parameter thromboembolic history . Special care avoid hematoma injection site must observe . 24 . Abnormal coagulation study ( prothrombin time [ PT ] /partial thromboplastin time [ PTT ] ) Baseline . 25 . History serious bleeding injection , elevate INR , concomitant medication condition ( i.e . significant thrombocytopenia ) opinion investigator would render subject risk significant bleeding injection . 26 . Blood donations/losses within 2 month Baseline , apart previous prostatic surgery patient ( see exclusion 10 [ rationale : avoid excessive blood donation ] ) . 27 . Known hypersensitivity GnRH , GnRH agonist , include LHRH analogue , excipients study formulation ( rationale : minimize hypersensitivity reaction study drug ) . 28 . History Immunization ( within 4 week Baseline ) specifically flu shot ( within 1 week Baseline 1 week study drug administration ) ( Rationale : decrease possibility non treatmentrelated AEs attribute study drug ) . 29 . Skin disease would interfere injection site evaluation . 30 . Men willing use appropriate birth control method surgical sterilization barrier contraception men partner child bear potential willing use appropriate birth control method , surgical sterilization , hormonal birth control ( partner ) , intrauterine device ( partner ) doublebarrier method entire study period .</criteria>
