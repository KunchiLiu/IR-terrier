	<brief_summary>The purpose study prospectively evaluate noninvasive , near-infrared base method measure glucose concentration relative invasive blood reference measurement . The initial phase study focus procurement data need develop robust , accurate calibration . The second phase focus performance evaluation system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Noninvasive Blood Glucose Concentrations Relative Finger Capillary Blood Glucose References</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , individual diabetes must use invasive finger stick methodology determination blood glucose level . Although current technology glucose meter use small amount blood old generation meter , pain inconvenience associate invasive measurement number one reason cite inadequate infrequent blood glucose monitoring . In fact 67 % patient diabetes fail routinely monitor blood glucose level . A survey 1895 patient show finger soreness common reason give self-reported noncompliance test recommendation , follow pain , inconvenience , fear needle , `` '' ( include cost ) , ( Diabetes Care August 2001 vol . 24 . 8 1502-1503 ) . The ability make painless blood glucose measurement use light would address pain inconvenience issue associate current technology glucose meter . The initial application technology associate monitoring Gestational Diabetes . The International Association Diabetes Pregnancy Study Groups ( IADPSG ) recently release recommendation diagnose gestational diabetes , well clarify benefit treatment ( Diabetes Care , 2010 ; 33:676-682 ) . The IADPSG cite research find significant graded relationship increase maternal glucose level frequency four primary five secondary outcome . For example , 1-standard deviation increase maternal fasting , 1-hour , 2-hour plasma glucose level , correspond 38 % , 46 % , 38 % increase risk , respectively , primary outcome birth weight &gt; 90th percentile , 5 % , 18 % , 16 % increase risk , respectively , secondary outcome premature delivery 37 week gestation ( N Engl J Med 2008 ; 358:1991-2002 ) .</detailed_description>
