	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine confirm overall response rate ( &gt; = partial response [ PR ] ) MLN9708 ( ixazomib citrate ) , use single agent patient relapse multiple myeloma , proteasome inhibitor naïve ( include bortezomib ) naive OR receive less 6 cycle therapy bortezomib well PR progression time discontinuation . ( Arm A - Permanently close accrual Addendum 5 ) II . To determine confirm overall response rate ( &gt; = PR ) MLN9708 4 mg dose level combination dexamethasone patient relapse multiple myeloma , proteasome inhibitor naïve ( include bortezomib ) naïve OR receive less 6 cycle therapy bortezomib well PR progression time discontinuation . ( Arm B ) III . To determine confirm overall response rate ( &gt; = PR ) MLN9708 5.5 mg dose level combination dexamethasone patient relapse multiple myeloma , proteasome inhibitor naïve ( include bortezomib ) naïve OR receive less 6 cycle therapy bortezomib well PR progression time discontinuation . ( Arm C ) IV . To determine confirm overall response rate ( &gt; = PR ) MLN9708 combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone patient relapse multiple myeloma , proteasome inhibitor naive ( include bortezomib ) naïve OR receive less 6 cycle therapy bortezomib well PR progression time discontinuation . ( Arm D ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate MLN9708 combination dexamethasone , dexamethasone add MLN9708 lack response progression . ( Arm A ) II . To determine event free survival overall survival among patient relapse myeloma follow treatment MLN9708 dexamethasone add lack response progression . ( Arm A ) III . To determine event free survival overall survival among patient relapse myeloma follow treatment MLN9708 two different dos , combination dexamethasone . ( Arms B C ) IV . To determine event free survival overall survival among patient relapse myeloma follow treatment MLN9708 combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . ( Arms D ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm ( Arm A permanently close accrual Addendum 5 ) . ARM A : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients lack minor response end second course lack partial response end fourth course also receive dexamethasone PO day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO day 1 , 8 15 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive high dose ixazomib citrate PO day 1 , 8 , 15 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM D : Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , cyclophosphamide PO dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 12 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
