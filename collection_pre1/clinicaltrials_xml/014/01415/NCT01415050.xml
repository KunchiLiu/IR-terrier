	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary 1 . To establish effect whole-body vibration ( WBV ) biomarkers bone remodelling postmenopausal woman osteoporosis . 2 . To establish effect whole-body vibration ( WBV ) fall risk low back pain postmenopausal woman osteoporosis . Secondary 1 . To compare effect WBV treatment effect treatment without WBV biomarkers bone remodelling , fall risk low back pain , keep standard pharmacotherapy constant parameter 2 . To compare effect WBV combination alendronate effect WBV combination raloxifene biomarkers bone remodelling , fall risk low back pain 3 . To evaluate long-term effect WBV biomarkers bone remodelling , fall risk low back pain 4 . Safety WBV Study Design Multicentered , randomize study safety efficacy whole-body vibration ( WBV ) add standard pharmacological treatment osteoporosis ( alendronate 70 mg/ week raloxifene 60 mg/day ) post-menopausal woman . After informed consent patient obtain , patient 's potential eligibility assess `` Screening Visit '' . Eligible subject stratify two group : treatment alendronate treatment raloxifene . Subsequently , baseline , patient group randomise receive either WBV WBV first segment study . Baseline evaluation biomarkers bone remodelling , fall risk back pain perform start first segment . Patients return efficacy safety evaluation week 3 week 6 . At 6 week baseline second segment study start : patient WBV segment I observe another 6 week without WBV , whereas patient receive WBV segment I treat WBV 6 week segment II . All patient return additional visit week 9 12 safety efficacy evaluation . Number Subjects Total number : 80 patient Group I : Patients alendronate , n=40 Group I : WBV segment I , WBV segment II , n= 20 Group I b : WBV segment I , WBV segment II , n=20 Group II : Patients raloxifene , n=40 Group II : WBV segment I , WBV segment II , n= 20 Group II b : WBV segment I , WBV segment II , n=20 Diagnosis / Main Inclusion Criteria Ambulatory postmenopausal woman , last menstrual period least 2 year begin study Free severe acute chronically disable condition life expectancy least 5 year Expected remain ambulatory throughout entire study expect return study visit Expected compliant study procedure , include procedure WBV usage Women language barrier , cooperative , give informed consent enter study Women must standard therapy alendronate raloxifene least 3 month commencement WBV , treatment must expect remain stable throughout study Main Exclusion Criteria Participation another clinical study within last 30 day and/or study Subjects inmates psychiatric ward , prison , state institution Investigators team member involve directly indirectly conduct clinical study Thrombophlebitis , deep venous thrombosis , thromboembolic disorder ( include pulmonary retinal embolism ) within last year Any vascular disorder low extremity exception asymptomatic varicosis Current bone disorder primary osteoporosis , hyperparathyroidism , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , osteomalacia , osteonecrosis , spondylolisthesis Vertebral fracture fracture low extremity within last 6 month start WBV Frequent occurrence muscle spasm limit use WBV Spastic disorder Morbus Sudeck ( CRPS I ) Malignancy within past 2 year exception situ removal basal cell carcinoma Severe cardiovascular disorder , limited : controllable hypertension , clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia cardiac valve disorder , heart failure ( NYHA III-IV ) Cerebral vascular accident within past 1 year Any neurologic/psychiatric disorder might interfere conduct trial study result , limited , follow : Depression , schizophrenia , dementia , Parkinson 's disease , epilepsy Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Frequent occurrence migraine attack ( per month ) , limit use WBV Active renal lithiasis gall stone define colic within 6 month prior start WBV Acute inflammation , infection and/or fever Immune compromise condition , limit , rheumatoid arthritis , HIV severe diabetes , e.g . define coexistence arterial occlusive disease Major surgical intervention within 3 month prior WBV Metallic plastic implant like joint implant , pace maker , cardiac valve , stent , eye lens limit use WBV Any acute joint inflammation low extremity part body might interfere use WBV within last 6 month start WBV Start change regimen physical therapy , extreme sportive activity within 1 month prior study study Treatment dose follow medication recently 6 month begin study : Androgen , Calcitonin , Estrogen , Progestin , strontium ranelate , parathormone , proton pump inhibitor Long term treatment ( 6 month ) Heparin within last 2 year Patients alendronate group must naïve bisphosphonates raloxifen Patients raloxifen group must naïve bisphosphonates Treatment WBV within last 6 month Treatment therapeutic dos systemic corticosteroid 1 month 12 month begin study Treatment 50,000 IU vitamin D weekly recently 3 month begin study Investigational Medical Device ( IMD ) Whole Body Vibration procedure ( WBV ) perform use Fitvibe® medical ( Manufacturer : Uniphy Elektromedizin GmbH &amp; Co. KG , Germany ) , certify medical device , follow way : Three Sessions per week treatment , minimum 15 session within period 6 week One session consist 10 run contain 30 sec vibration interval 15 sec plateau , interrupt 30 sec pause Frequency 30 Hz Amplitude 2 mm Efficacy Endpoints Primary 1 . Changes biomarkers bone formation ( Bone specific alcalic phosphatase - Ostase ) bone resorption ( cross link N-terminal telopeptide type 1 collagen - N-Tx ) treatment WBV 2 . Changes fall risk ( Tinetti Mobility test ) low back pain ( 11 point NAS ) treatment WBV Secondary 1 . Changes Ostase N-Tx biomarkers first 3 week treatment WBV 2 . Changes Ostase N-Tx biomarkers Segment II Group I II 3 . Changes fall risk ( Tinetti Mobility test ) low back pain ( 11 point NAS ) first 3 week treatment WBV 4 . Changes fall risk ( Tinetti Mobility test ) low back pain ( 11 point NAS ) Segment II Group I II Safety Variables Routine physical examination , monitor vital sign , body height adverse event Statistical Methods The confirmatory analysis base primary criterion `` Effect WBV '' , measure change marker bone formation Ostase N-Tx well fall risk low back pain start end WBV segment study ( within group comparison ) . Since normal distribution assume test variable , Wilcoxon-rank-test use two-sided test difference . The final evaluation primary criterion perform hierarchically follow order : 1 . `` change marker Ostase treatment WBV '' 2 . `` change marker N-Tx treatment WBV '' 3 . `` change fall risk treatment WBV '' 4 . `` change low back pain treatment WBV '' The hypothesis four test difference : H0 : µ1-µ2 = 0 H1 : µ1-µ2 = 0 The experiment wise multiple level alpha define alpha = 0.05 two-sided respectively required confirmatory study . If primary hypothesis test perform give order ( 1. 4 . ) test perform full alpha long result previous test turn significant ( Principle priori order hypothesis ) . The confirmatory analysis perform use ITT population ( intention-to-treat ) .</detailed_description>
