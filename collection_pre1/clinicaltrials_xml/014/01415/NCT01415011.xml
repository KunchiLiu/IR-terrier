	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Afatinib Treat Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cause death cancer , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account ~80 % case patient present advanced disease . Patients medically unfit receive radical platinum-doublet palliative systemic therapy , poor performance status comorbidity , account least 45 % newly diagnose case poor survival . Many oncologist interpret single-agent chemotherapy data clinically meaningful balanced toxicity , non-significant improvement quality life comorbidity . Hence , UK , group patient predominantly treat best-supportive care ( BSC ) . This study aim examine efficacy safety use afatinib ( BIBW 2992 ) , irreversible second generation EGFR inhibitor , patient non-small cell lung cancer , consider unfit chemotherapy either suspect confirmed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation . Suspected EGFR mutant patient clinical characteristic likely harbour EGFR mutation ( adenocarcinoma sub type ex never smoker ) EGFR genotype unknown either due tissue suitable genotyping fail genotype . There one small prospective study medically unfit patient EGFR mutation , demonstrate good efficacy TKI17 . This phase II study East Asian patient ( n=30 ) performance status 2-4 treat gefitinib demonstrate rapid improvement performance status 1 month , overall response rate 66 % median survival 17.8 month . Whilst gefitinib license EGFR mutant NSCLC , prospective study yet perform medically unfit patient Western country . Despite dramatic initial response , EGFR mutant NSCLC patient treat gefitinib/erlotinib ultimately relapse . In ~50 % case due gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant T790M genotype acquire either secondary somatic mutation clonal expansion . There therefore need improve outcome medically unfit patient suspect EGFR mutation , would otherwise treat best supportive care , proven EGFR mutation case use effective EGFR-directed therapy inhibits EGFRT790M . Prospective data medically unfit Western NSCLC patient EGFR mutation require assess efficacy EGFR-TKIs . Additionally , give 50 % patient become TKI-resistant EGFRT790M , new therapy require overcome resistance mechanism .</detailed_description>
