	<brief_summary>Presently , effective treatment patient advanced head neck cancer ( AHNC ) fail respond standard therapy ( radiation , chemotherapy surgery ) US . These patient deem incurable AHNC . In European Union ( EU ) , interstitial photodynamic therapy ( I-PDT ) Temoporfin approve treatment patient incurable AHNC . Well design EU study show I-PDT Temoporfin provide worthwhile palliation reduce tumor size , bleed pain 53 % - 60 % patient incurable AHNC . This significantly high rate comparison report response rate palliative chemotherapy ( 6-30 % ) . However , EU study correlate quantitative tumor response clinical outcome . In addition , quality life ( QoL ) improvement associate I-PDT AHNC use Temoporfin also evaluate . The objective study quantify tumor response patient 's QoL I-PDT Temoporfin . Successfully meet objective give u tools investigator need design large study significantly improve management QoL patient AHNC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomize , open label , Pilot phase II study 5 consenting subject . The specific aim study : Aim 1 : Quantitate local tumor response patient incurable AHNC treat I-PDT Temoporfin . Aim 2 : Evaluate change QoL patient incurable AHNC treat I-PDT Temoporfin .</detailed_description>

Laboratory criterion : Hematocrit &gt; = 33 % , hemoglobin &gt; = 11 g/dl Platelet count &gt; 70.000 per microliter BUN : 7 20 mg/dL CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) : 20 29 mmol/L Creatinine : 0.8 1.4 mg/dL Glucose : 64 128 mg/dL Serum chloride : 101 111 mmol/L Serum potassium : 3.7 5.2 mEq/L Serum sodium : 136 144 mEq/L Liver function test : albumin , bilirrubin ( direct/conjugated ) , ALT ( alanine transaminase ) , AST ( aspartate transaminade ) , GGT ( gamma glutamyl transferase ) , ALP ( alkaline phosphatase ) within normal limit White blood count &gt; 3,000 per microliter ANC &gt; 1500 per microliter Serum calcium within normal limit . A tumor close major blood vessel ( carotid artery ) . A tumor invade skull base . The tumor clearly show CT image . The location extension tumor precludes effective IPDT . Pregnant uncontrolled hyperglycemia . Has porphyria disease exacerbate light . With hypersensitivity Temoporfin excipients . Has know allergies/hypersensitivity porphyrin . Has know sensitivity CT contrast agent . ( Omnipaque ) Has poor renal function demonstrate serum creatinine EGFR &lt; 40 , would preclude use CT contrast agent . Patient plan surgical procedure within next 30 day . Has coexist ophthalmic disease likely require slitlamp examination within next 30 day . Patient exist therapy photosensitizing agent ( Temoporfin , protoporphyrin derivative porphyrin ) . Has receive prior photodynamic therapy propose treatment site within prior 3 month .
