	<detailed_description>More 500,000 new patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) diagnose year around world . Patients relapse primary therapy locoregional disease present distant metastasis limited prognosis . Drug therapy cancer control palliation patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN currently suboptimal . In contemporary trial active cytotoxic drug combination response rate range 30 % , associate frequent severe toxicity treatment-related mortality . Molecular target demonstrated oncology relevant strategy cancer therapeutic . In March 2006 , FDA announce approval chimeric monoclonal antibody epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , cetuximab , use combination radiation therapy patient locally advanced SCCHN . Furthermore , addition cetuximab cisplatin 5FU first-line therapy patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN significantly improve overall survival compare cisplatin 5FU alone . Phase II data cetuximab give monotherapy recurrent metastatic SCCHN patient progress platinum-based therapy demonstrate overall response rate 13 % median survival 6 month . Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFR , gefitinib erlotinib , seem slightly less effective cetuximab . Based result , FDA also approve cetuximab monotherapy use indication recurrent metastatic SCCHN . However , despite high expression EGFR SCCHN , EGFR inhibitor monotherapy modest activity . Potential mechanisms resistance EGFR-targeted therapy involve EGFR K-Ras mutation , epithelial-mesenchymal transition , activation alternative downstream pathway . Strategies optimize EGFR-targeted therapy head neck cancer involve selection patient likely benefit use therapy target network pathway involve tumor growth , invasion , angiogenesis , metastasis . Afatinib irreversible dual inhibitor EGFR HER2 tyrosine kinase . Preclinical data suggest Afatinib might large spectrum antitumor activity EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . In vivo vitro study indeed show Afatinib display antitumor activity erlotinib/gefitinib-resistant lung model . Afatinib compare favourably cetuximab platinum-resistant metastatic SCCHN . In addition , Afatinib show promising antitumor activity HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer trastuzumab failure metastatic adenocarcinoma lung harbour EGFR activate mutation . To date , predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers study mostly perform pre-treated metastatic patient . Erlotinib study EGFR-targeted agent term biomarkers identification SCCHN . In metastatic setting , sequential biopsy allow correlate potential predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers outcome patient treat erlotinib . The decrease p-EGFR tumor tissue associate increase time-to-progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) one study . In another study , elevate pre-treatment level p27 p-STAT3 tumor tissue predict prolonged TTP OS , decrease p-EGFR , p-NFkB p27 correlate increased TTP , OS . However , lack control arm preclude draw definitive conclusion . One study evaluate erlotinib neoadjuvant setting untreated patient operable SCCHN . Baseline p21 expression tumor tissue correlate clinical response treatment . But , absence control arm later study preclude draw definitive conclusion regard potential predictive pharmacodynamic value biomarkers evaluation . The main characteristic study : 1. pre-operative setting untreated patient advantage untreated patient easy get pre- post-treatment tumor specimen , initial panendoscopy surgery , respectively 2. randomization versus treatment way able draw robust conclusion regard potential predictive pharmacodynamic value biomarkers evaluation . Single-arm phase II trial identify prognostic marker activity , predictive biomarkers activity . Importantly , surgery delay case study . However , require planning surgery enable patient receive 21 28 day treatment participate study give plan date surgery .</detailed_description>
