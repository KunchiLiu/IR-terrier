	<brief_summary>Background : - MLN4924 experimental cancer drug . It may help kill lymphoma cell make sensitive chemotherapy . EPOCH R combination chemotherapy drug . It effective treat case large B-cell lymphoma . This research look two thing . The first effect MLN4924 treat large B-cell lymphoma . The second safe dose effect MLN4924 EPOCH-R combination treat large B-cell lymphoma . Objectives : - To study MLN4924 affect large B-cell lymphoma tumor . - To compare effect MLN 4924 alone MLN4924 plus standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age large B-cell lymphoma treat chemotherapy . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood urine test , tumor sample , image study . - Participants receive MLN4924 maximum six 21-day cycle treatment . Each cycle involve dose MLN4924 twice week 2 week , follow 1-week rest period . Participants monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants benefit MLN4924 alone MLN4924 along EPOCH-R chemotherapy six cycle treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN4924 Compared With MLN4924 Plus Chemotherapy Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) molecularly sub-classified germinal center like B-cell ( GCB ) activate B-cell like ( ABC ) DLBCL . - Clinically , ABC subtype significantly high rate drug resistance low survival . The ABC subtype constitutive activation NF-KappaB pathway may account drug resistance . - The ability NF-KappaB inhibit response cancer therapeutic agent may also contribute refractory clinical behavior ABC subtype , inhibition NF-KappaB synergize chemotherapy kill tumor cell . - Because phase II randomize design clinically technically practical early stage address scientific endpoint , design novel endpoint base relative efficacy DA-EPOCH-R + MLN 4924 ( DA-EPOCH-RN ) ABC GCB DLBCL . Based study show survival relapse ABC GCB DLBCL comparable poor follow initial R-CHOP , hypothesize significantly improve survival ABC compare GCB DLBCL DA-EPOCH-RN strongly indicative preferential activity MLN4924 ABC DLBCL . Objectives : - Assess response MLN4924 relapsed/refractory DLBCL - Assess toxicity safe tolerate dose MLN4924 DA-EPOCH-R - Assess difference response ( CR/PR ) OS ABC GCB DLBCL Eligibility : - Relapsed/refractory de novo DLBCL great equal 18 year . - No PMBL DLBCL - No patient active CNS lymphoma . - No pregnant breast-feeding woman . - Adequate organ function ( define protocol ) . Study Design : - This single center sequential treatment design . The study divide two part ( A B ) . Clinical end point assess activity MLN4924 alone ( Part A ) combination DA-EPOCH-R ( Part B ) , assess toxicity MTD DA-EPOCH-RN . - In Part A , MLN4924 give alone 6 cycle . - In Part B , MLN4924 initially escalate determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination DA-EPOCH-R dose level ( determine ) schedule every 21 day . Responding stable patient may receive 6 cycle DAEPOCH-RN . - Patients restaged every 2 cycle treatment , every 3 , 4 6 month year one , two three respectively , thereafter . Standard response criterion apply . - A total 56 patient enrol depend relative difference response observe ABC GCB subtypes MLN4924 .</detailed_description>
