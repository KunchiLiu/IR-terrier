	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis C major cause liver disease thus important public health problem . Although strain ( genotype ) hepatitis C virus highly responsive treatment combination peginterferon ribavirin , common form virus ( genotype 1 ) relatively resistant treatment . Recently , telaprevir approve Food Drug Administration give combination peginterferon ribavirin . This 3-drug combination boost remission rate genotype 1 hepatitis C see responsive hepatitis C genotype treat peginterferon ribavirin . However , telaprevir additional side affect rash anemia may limit usefulness . Intriguingly , one third patient infect genotype 1 hepatitis C , specific variation ( polymorphism ) DNA sequence ( CC ) near immune response gene ( IL28B ) , fact highly responsive 2-drug treatment peginterferon ribavirin . This raise possibility individual IL28B CC polymorphism may need treated addition telaprevir could therefore spared unnecessary side effect . Thus , purpose study determine among genotype 1 hepatitis C patient IL28B CC polymorphism success rate side effect 3-drug treatment compare 2-drug treatment . In study , patient genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C IL28B CC polymorphism randomly assign treat telaprevir , peginterferon , ribavirin peginterferon ribavirin . These medication procedure involve , include patient history , physical examination , obtain small volume blood specimen ( less 4 teaspoon ) laboratory testing , within scope standard management hepatitis C treatment . All patient monitor treatment periodic blood test ( week 2 , 4 , every 4 week thereafter treatment , 24 week stop treatment ) office visit ( week 5 , 12 , 25 , 49 treatment 25 week stop treatment ) . The success treatment judge presence absence detectable virus blood , measure sensitive diagnostic test ( PCR ) . The data generate include measurement PCR hepatitis C viral load , , treatment , well report adverse drug effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , affect 1-2 % adult United States , major risk factor liver failure due cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma ( Davis 2010 ) . Epidemiological information suggest frequency HCV-related sequela likely continue increase next 10-15 year unless effective well-tolerated treatment become available . Development improve antiviral therapy thus important public health priority . Until recently , effective treatment chronic HCV infection combination peginterferon ribavirin , give 48 week . With regimen , sustain virological response ( SVR ) , define undetectable HCV RNA 24 week completion antiviral treatment , approximately 50-60 % ( Hoofnagle 2006 ) . Not patient able complete therapy however ; 10 % discontinue prematurely result intolerable side effect , predominantly depression and/or fatigue ( Seeff 2010 ) . The major determinant responsiveness antiviral therapy viral genotype select host characteristic . Hepatitis C genotype 1 ( HCV-1 ) , account approximately 70 % chronic infection North America , relatively resistant treatment peginterferon ribavirin . SVR treatment HCV-1 approximately 40 % ( Hoofnagle 2006 ) . That say , among HCV-1-infected individual , diversity SVR , correlate dinucleotide polymorphism locus upstream interleukin 28B ( IL28B ) gene . Specifically , 48 week peginterferon ribavirin therapy , 70 % individual IL28B CC polymorphism achieve SVR , compare 30 % individual IL28B polymorphism ( Thompson 2010 ) . New treatment chronic HCV-1 infection available . In May 2011 , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve telaprevir , orally available small molecule inhibitor HCV-1 protease , treatment chronic HCV-1 , give combination peginterferon ribavirin . In HCV-1-infected patient , three-drug regimen show confer SVR 75 % ( Jacobson 2011 ) . However , regimen appear associated nearly 1.5-fold increase premature drug discontinuation , comparison regimen peginterferon , ribavirin alone , largely influenced development telaprevir-associated rash . Given high responsiveness conventional peginterferon ribavirin among HCV-1-infected individual IL28B CC polymorphism , hypothesize SVR enhanced individual addition telaprevir peginterferon ribavirin therapy . If correct , HCV-1-infected patient IL28B CC polymorphism treat comparable success peginterferon ribavirin alone therefore spared telaprevir-associated adverse affect . The propose study , prospective randomize open label trial ( HCV-1-infected subject IL28B CC polymorphism ) treatment telaprevir ( T ) , peginterferon ( P ) , ribavirin ( R ) versus PR alone , test work hypothesis . The study design take advantage concept response-guided treatment , strategy duration antiviral treatment base upon presence absence rapid virological response ( RVR ) , define loss detectable serum HCV RNA within first 4 week therapy . In particular , show HCV-1 patient achieve RVR ( maintain undetectable HCV RNA 12 week ( define eRVR ) , either PR-containing TPR-containing regimen comparable SVR 24 week , compare 48 week , total treatment ( Mangia 2008 , Jacobson 2011 ) .</detailed_description>
