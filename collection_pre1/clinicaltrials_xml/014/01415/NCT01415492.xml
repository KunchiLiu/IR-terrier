	<detailed_description>HD2 conduct randomize control trial two metropolitan Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates ( HVMA ) sit . The unit randomization primary care provider . Providers randomize one three arm : 1 . Usual care , control arm . 2 . HD2 , intervention arm , include access study information via website study information content via print material . Content address 5 targeted health behavior goal , importance track behavior order improve behavior , importance social support behavior change . 3 . HD2+ , another intervention arm , include access study information content described , PLUS two coach call . Note : access website available 6 month recruitment . In addition , investigator want test use electronic reminder might increase engagement intervention . So , sub-set intervention arm randomize receive additional electronic reminder . Participants allow choose either AVR ( voicemail ) SMS ( text message ) delivery brief electronic reminder . The investigator conduct recruitment rolling basis . Patients assigned condition primary care provider randomize . The investigator offer participation provider Internal Medicine department full patient panel conduct annual well visit physicals adult HVMA patient . All participate provider inform HD2 study presentation study staff . Providers could elect opt participation prior patient recruitment period . Potentially eligible patient send recruitment letter appointment date . This letter introduce study let patient know study staff may approach clinic discus possible participation . The letter also include phone number patient call want opt-out approach . At appointment , study staff approach people opt . They discuss study , answered question , screen eligibility , enrol interested , eligible patient . Once patient sign informed consent ask complete write , self-administered , baseline survey give small incentive time . After complete baseline survey , patient UC group receive 5 pamphlet address 5 behavior study . In addition study material describe previously , HD2 HD2+ participant receive bottle multi-vitamins pedometer support two health behavior . HD2 HD2+ participant also receive tailored feedback report base baseline survey response ( mailed participant approximately one week post recruitment ) . All participant complete baseline survey contact two follow-up survey , administer phone survey assistant . The first follow-up survey do end intervention period ( 6 month post recruitment ) . The second follow-up survey do 18 month post recruitment ) . Those participant unreachable telephone give option complete abbreviate version survey , send via mail . A small incentive give participant completion follow-up survey . AIMS : A.1 . To determine efficacy HD2 intervention . Hypothesis 1.1 : Participants HD2/HD2+ intervention achieve significantly great change multiple risk behavior score 6- 18-month follow-up UC . Hypothesis 1.2 : Participants HD2/HD2+ intervention achieve significantly great change individual risk factor 6- 18-month follow-up , compare UC ( secondary outcome ) . Hypothesis 1.3 : Participants receive electronic reminder achieve significantly great change multiple risk behavior score 6- 18-month follow-up . Hypothesis 1.4 : Participants receive electronic reminder achieve significantly great change individual risk factor 6- 18-month follow-up . A.2 . To evaluate impact HD2/HD2+ intervention term maximize participation/reach , intervention delivery , cost-effectiveness . A3 . To determine whether provide assistance key component web site , behavior tracking , stimulate high rate use . Validation component parent study : N = 150 participant . As part protocol , investigator recruit small sample original cohort . All quit smoker offer enrollment random sample remain cohort offer enrollment . The investigator use `` gold standard '' validate data . Dietary data ( fruit &amp; vegetable , red meat , multivitamin use ) measure 24-hour telephone-administered food recall interview . Physical activity measure accelerometer . Smoking cessation measure saliva cotinine test . TRACKING SUBSTUDY ( n=100 ) Aim substudy : To determine whether provide assistance key component web site , behavior tracking , stimulate high rate use . Methods : All eligible interested participant enrol recruited web arm parent study intervention . We use eligibility criterion data collection . In summary , self-monitoring rate enrol patient assessed day 7 HD2 website use . If he/she log HD2 web site complete behavior track least 3 time continue study additional technical support . Participants complete behavior self-monitoring least 3 time divide two group . Group 1 receive Automated Assistance ( email ) Group 2 receive Personal Assistance ( 2 call trained staff offer technical assistance need ) &amp; Automated Assistance email like Group 1 .</detailed_description>
