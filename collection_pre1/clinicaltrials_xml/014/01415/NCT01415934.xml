	<detailed_description>Currently , 80 % population expect die chronic life-limiting illness , predominant among various manifestation cardiovascular disease , cancer , dementia , chronic lung disease . Patients high cholesterol potentially risk atherosclerotic heart disease stroke often treat preventively HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor ( a.k.a. , statin ) . Clinical trial evidence support use statins patient hyperlipidemia establish ischemic heart disease reduce risk future cardiovascular event mortality , reduce risk future cardiovascular event patient multiple cardiac risk factor . Beneficial outcomes evident trial 3-6 year treatment . Hence , statins among prescribed medication world . In United States , 25 % Medicare beneficiary take statin medication . Statin medication frequently continue patient longer eat swallow end life , evidence-based guideline regard discontinue medication co-morbidities . The risk cost vs. benefit statin palliative care patient , prognosis limit , remain genuine clinical uncertainty . Meanwhile , medication symptoms concern accumulate illness progress , therefore polypharmacy compound medication side effect troublesome problem set advance life-limiting illness . While multiple study demonstrate benefit long-term preventive statin use patient cardiovascular risk , study support discontinuation medication ( specifically statins ) end-stage disease . A rational approach medication discontinuation , specifically statin discontinuation , therefore potential reduce patient burden , polypharmacy , side effect , also preserve healthcare resource beneficial intervention . This study multi-site randomize control trial discontinue vs. continue statin medication patient advance life-limiting illness . Eligible participant adult advance life-limiting illness estimate prognosis 1-6 month statin primary secondary prevention cardiovascular event . The primary outcome survival rate 60 day ; secondary outcome address cardiovascular event , polypharmacy , medication adverse effect , quality life ( QOL ) , measure patient 's health-related experience . The primary hypothesis discontinuing statins influence survival . Secondary hypothesis discontinuation statins adversely affect cardiovascular event overall QOL , improve statin-related symptom decrease polypharmacy .</detailed_description>
