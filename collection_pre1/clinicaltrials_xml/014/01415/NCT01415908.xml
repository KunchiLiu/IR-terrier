	<brief_title>INFUSE®Bone Graft Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion Degenerative Disease Lumbosacral Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , multi-national study compare INFUSE® Bone Graft ( investigational group ) autogenous bone graft ( control group ) . Control group subject receive surgical treatment except use autogenous bone graft ( iliac crest ) instead INFUSE® Bone Graft . All site follow common Clinical Investigational Plan ( CIP ) consist protocol accompany case report form , risk analysis , investigator 's agreement , subject informed consent , institutional review board ( IRB ) certification , label , monitor information .</detailed_description>
