	<brief_summary>Sepsis represent lead cause childhood mortality worldwide . However , distinct adult medicine , exist large knowledge gap regard long term health relate quality life ( HRQL ) functional status ( FS ) follow pediatric sepsis . This lack sepsis outcomes data critical failure identify child risk sepsis associate HRQL/FS deterioration may delay delivery crucial rehabilitation medicine effort facilitate recovery . Moreover , failure identify mechanisms sepsis associate HRQL/FS deterioration may impede development novel , effective intervention child . For first time LAPSE investigation quantify deterioration HRQL/FS among child survive sepsis . We measure incidence , magnitude duration HRQL/FS alteration associate pediatric septic shock , examine clinical , sociodemographic , parent/family factor potentially associate adverse outcome . Because sepsis affect heterogeneous group child , long term morbidity associate sepsis likely depend premorbid health status parent , family home characteristic , well child 's clinical course sepsis critical illness . Mechanisms underlying adverse sepsis outcome among child poorly understood time . Clinically multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) clearly link sepsis mortality . To begin understand pathophysiology underlie pediatric sepsis morbidity , investigation seek identify evidence association HRQL/FS alteration follow sepsis intensity duration sepsis mediate organ dysfunction well pre-existing comorbidities parent , family , home characteristic . Thelong term goal research program timely identify child high risk sepsis mediate HRQL/FS deterioration ultimately design effective intervention minimize risk . The primary objective investigation comprehensively characterize HRQL/FS trajectory critically examine potential role sepsis mediate organ dysfunction well pre-existing comorbidities parent , family , home characteristic risk factor adverse outcome . The central hypothesis intensity sepsis organ dysfunction predict magnitude HRQL/FS deterioration . We also hypothesize trajectory towards baseline HRQL/FS follow sepsis event also depend pre-existing co-morbidities parent , family , home , characteristic . Knowledge potential mechanism ultimately facilitate development target intervention maximize HRQL/FS among child survive sepsis .</brief_summary>
