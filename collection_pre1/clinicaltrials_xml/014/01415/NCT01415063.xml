	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Versus Radiofrequency Ablation Alone Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common cancer world . Partial hepatectomy liver transplantation consider standard curative therapy HCC . When surgery possible , percutaneous ablation usually consider alternative treatment HCC . Recurrence frequent serious adverse event observe follow-up HCC patient treated cure . Repeat hepatectomy effective treatment HCC recurrence , 5-year survival rate 19.4 56 % . Unfortunately , repeat hepatectomy perform small proportion patient HCC recurrence ( 10.4 31 % ) , either poor functional liver reserve widespread recurrence . ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) consider one effective percutaneous ablation early-stage HCC patient without surgical prospect . Studies use RFA treat HCC recurrence hepatectomy report 3-year survival rate 62 % 68 % , comparable achieve surgery . RFA particularly suitable treat HCC recurrence hepatectomy tumor usually detect small , RFA cause least deterioration liver function patient . RFA also effective manage HCC recurrence initial treatment RFA . Clinical data show , repeat RFA , estimate 3-and 5-year overall , disease-free survival rate patient HCC recurrence 67.0 % 40.1 % 68.0 38.0 % , respectively.Therefore , consider RFA effective treatment HCC recurrence curative treatment . The combination transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) RFA also report effective treatment HCC . Studies show TACE combine RFA well efficacy RFA medium-sized HCC ( 3-5 cm ) multiple-tumor HCC , small HCC ( ≤3 cm ) . However , knowledge , prospective study ass whether TACE combine sequentially RFA effective RFA alone treatment HCC recurrence curative treatment . We hypothesize combination TACE RFA might result good patient survival RFA alone . Thus , purpose study prospectively compare effect sequential TACE-RFA RFA alone treatment recurrent HCC . Recurrent HCC study define new tumor remnant liver , distant resection ablation site curative treatment RFA hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
