	<brief_summary>In pilot study , researcher investigate feasibility closed-loop electroencephalography ( EEG ) / transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) system treatment epilepsy . They look see feasibility trigger tDCS stimulation within 10 second detected EEG partial-onset seizure , also proof-of-principle determination whether tDCS apply vulnerable period may feasible prevent oncoming seizure . This study require 5 visit course approximately 8 week . Each visit separate least 2 week . Two visit 24-hour EEG monitoring session . During two session , EEG tDCS hook close loop system , seizure activity wasdetected , tDCS trigger deliver stimulation . Subjects receive active stimulation sham stimulation session first 24-hour visit , opposite second . The subject randomize counterbalanced . We also add healthy subject cohort ass feasibility close loop system . In order test proof-of-concept system , experiment focus detect act upon alpha- beta-band change trace EEG activity record , provide tDCS stimulation base upon change . We enroll 6 subject 2 visit . During two visit subject randomize active sham stimulation session receive opposite second visit .</brief_summary>
