	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , also work different way kill cancer cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Lenalidomide may stop growth mantle cell lymphoma block blood flow cancer . It yet know whether give rituximab together bendamustine bortezomib effective rituximab bendamustine , follow rituximab alone lenalidomide treat mantle cell lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study rituximab , bortezomib , bendamustine , lenalidomide treat previously untreated old patient mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether addition bortezomib ( RBV ) induction regimen rituximab-bendamustine hydrochloride ( RB ) improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare RB alone patient ≥ 60 year age previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma . - To determine whether addition lenalidomide consolidation regimen rituximab follow induction regimen RB RBV improve PFS compare consolidation rituximab alone patient population . Secondary - To determine whether addition bortezomib induction therapy improve positron emission tomography ( PET ) -documented complete response ( CR ) rate compare RB alone . - To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) RB RBV . - Among patient PET-documented CR end induction , determine whether addition lenalidomide consolidation therapy improve CR ORR compare rituximab alone . - To determine overall survival ( OS ) treatment arm . - To determine safety , attention addition bortezomib induction regimen lenalidomide-rituximab ( LR ) consolidation therapy . - To collect paraffin-embedded tissue creation tissue microarray . - To collect bank serum blood mononuclear cell future study . - To collect formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue analyze potential prognostic factor ( Ki-67 proliferation index immunohistochemistry correlation propose 5-gene set proliferation marker analyze RNA PCR ; SOX 11 expression immunohistochemistry ; Micro-RNA level microarray ) . - Using patient-reported outcome data , determine extent severity neuropathy associate addition bortezomib induction treatment . - Using patient-reported outcome data , determine extent severity fatigue associate addition lenalidomide consolidation treatment . - To evaluate effect addition bortezomib lenalidomide patient-reported health-related quality life . - To evaluate effect bortezomib-related neuropathy patient-reported health-related quality life . - To evaluate response lymphoma-specific symptom treatment . - Using longitudinal patient-reported outcome data , describe trajectory lymphoma symptom , neuropathy , fatigue , overall health-related quality life prior , , follow treatment among old adult MCL . Tertiary - To assess proportion patient stag fludeoxyglucose F 18- ( FDG ) PET/CT add standard Ann Arbor stag . - To assess ability pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT ( SUVmax ) predict response rate PFS . - Among patient interim ( post-cycle 3 ) FDG-PET/CT imaging , assess correlation interim FDG-PET/CT image response rate PFS induction consolidation therapy . - To assess standard FDG-PET/CT metric include SUVmax , tumor metabolic burden , total tumor burden , association pathology feature ( blastoid variant v , Ki67 ) set MCL . - To assess difference overall CR rate use Deauville v International Harmonization Project FDG-PET/CT interpretation criterion . - To determine whether correlation FDG-PET/CT response residual disease assessment molecular and/or flow cytometric technique . - To determine whether number malignant cell circulation predict number cell marrow . - To determine whether number malignant cell circulation/in marrow end induction correlate CR 2-year PFS . - To determine whether high rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity among patient randomize RBV compare RB , among patient treat LR maintenance compare rituximab . - To compare two method MRD detection - molecular technique flow cytometry - prognostic marker outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord mantle cell lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk score ( low v intermediate v high ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive induction therapy comprise rituximab IV day 1 bendamustine hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm E : Patients receive consolidation therapy comprise rituximab IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm B : Patients receive induction therapy comprise bortezomib IV subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride patient arm A . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm F : Patients receive consolidation therapy comprise rituximab IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm C : Patients receive induction therapy comprise rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride patient arm A . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm G : Patients receive consolidation therapy comprise lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 every 4 week rituximab IV every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm D : Patients receive bortezomib , rituximab , bendamustine hydrochloride patient arm B . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm H : Patients receive consolidation therapy comprise lenalidomide PO daily day 1-21 every 4 week rituximab IV every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo blood bone marrow sample collection baseline treatment correlative study . Patients complete Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma ( FACT-Lym ) , FACT/GOG-Neurotoxicity scale ( FACT/GOG-Ntx ) , FACT-Fatigue , FACT-General questionnaire baseline periodically study follow . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
