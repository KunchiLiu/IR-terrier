	<brief_summary>Fifty thousand people die colorectal cancer ( CRC ) every year , make second leading cause death cancer United States . And although multiple screen test reduce morbidity mortality disease , le 60 % eligible individual date recommend screening . One challenge improve screen help patient understand range approve test , include colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy , stool testing ( fecal immunochemical testing ( FIT ) ) . Patients rarely consider option , partly due limited time learn busy doctor 's visit . Computer-based presentation , include decision aid , promise tool improve patient understand area , give patient significant amount information . But important question design presentation , include whether provide quantitative data risk benefit screen . Some expert feel number graph necessary fully inform decision-making , others concern may confuse patient dissuade screen . The investigator create pilot test computer-based presentation quantitative information CRC screening . The investigator find subject view program non-healthcare setting exhibit significantly increase interest screening . In addition , investigator test version program include `` nudge '' towards stool test FIT , way encouraging individual confuse undergo form screening . In test , receive nudge associate significant increase interest FIT . The investigator seek conduct randomize , control study computer-based presentation Clarian patient due CRC screening . All subject first view general video CRC screen randomly place four group ( use 2x2 design ) , receive quantitative information ( ) , nudge towards FIT ( ) . The result determine whether presentation quantitative information increase patient understanding , quality decision-making , uptake CRC screening . The result serve pilot data large , externally fund study effect individualize ( `` personalize '' ) quantitative information area</brief_summary>
