	<brief_summary>The purpose study prove safety efficacy plasma add-on treatment combination conventional treatment case chronical venous Ulcus cruris .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility , Efficacy , Safety Venous Ulcer Treatment Using Hand Plasma Generator ( PlasmaDerm ) Chronisch venöser Ulzerationen ( PlasmaDerm )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcus cruris consist pathologically change tissue lower leg . Up 80 % venous origin . Because high prevalence 2 % treatment Ulcus cruris special economical importance . Depending size , depth possible infection , conventional treatment wound consist adequate compression , preparation lesion , cover appropriate control infection . All task undertaken order faciliate heal chronic wound . Plasma consist free ion electron create various technique . Commonly , use sterilization medicinal equipment , cauterization tissue field coagulation . Because bactericidal characteristic , direct interaction plasma create temperature 40°C tissue intensively study . Both vitro vivo study prove significant reduction bacterial contamination different test system . As bacterial contamination might slow wound healing , plasma treatment might useful tool complement conventional method treatment chronical wound .</detailed_description>
