	<brief_title>Using SCOUT Noninvasive AGE Measurements Forecast Diabetes Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus major health problem United States throughout world 's developed develop nation . In 2002 , American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) estimate 12.1 million Americans ( 4.2 % ) diagnose form diabetes [ 1 ] , World Health Organization ( WHO ) assess global diabetes caseload 173 million year 2000 [ 2 ] . While type 1 patient comprise approximately 5 -10 % US case [ 3 ] , severe morbidity patient include renal failure , blindness , neuropathy micro- macro-vascular disease motivate search improve technique monitor disease status . Diabetes devastate individual health significant impact national economy . In 2002 , US economic impact relate diabetes exceed $ 132 billion . Due numerous complication result chronic hyperglycemia wide array health service involve . For example , 5 20 percent US service area cardiovascular disease , kidney disease , endocrine metabolic complication , ophthalmic disorder attributable diabetes . Landmark clinical trial US UK establish tight glucose control via regimen glucose monitoring , insulin and/or sulfonylurea drug therapy , exercise , proper diet significantly reduce progression , risk , develop diabetic complication [ 4 , 5 ] . Long-term , chronic hyperglycemia recognize initiator debilitate diabetes-related complication blindness , kidney failure nerve damage [ 6 ] . Hence , effective monitor overall glycemic control reflect long-term , integrated glycemic insult body . One concept monitor long-term glycemic control involve measurement analyte whose concentration monotonically increase course disease progression . Such chemical marker would vary state patient present day test . The process protein glycation ( 'browning ' ) , govern Maillard reaction , produce several advanced glycation endproducts attractive candidate 'diabetes meter . ' These compound currently assay invasive procedure , require biopsy specimen , , base upon initial result VeraLight SCOUT , also accessible noninvasive monitoring .</detailed_description>
