	<brief_summary>In United States , African Americans 3.6 time Hispanics 1.5 time likely suffer chronic kidney disease need dialysis treatment life , compare non-Hispanic Whites . Unfortunately many dialysis patient die , 5 year less 35 % still alive . Dialysis patient appear malnourish muscle fat waste even likely die . Interestingly , among dialysis patient , minority ( African Americans , Hispanics Asian Americans ) usually survive long non-Hispanic Whites . If investigator discover reason so-called `` racial survival disparity '' dialysis patient , investigator may able improve survival dialysis patient maybe even many people suffer chronic disease . During 5 year study investigator would like test different nutrition diet explain good survival minority dialysis patient . The investigator also test additional nutrition 2 reason well survival minority dialysis patient , namely differences bone mineral difference social psychological mental health . The investigator plan study 450 hemodialysis patient every 6 month several dialysis clinic Los Angeles South Bay area . These subject include 30 % African Americans , 30 % Hispanics , 30 % non-Hispanic Whites 10 % Asians . Every 6 month investigator examine nutritional condition , dietary intake , psycho-social condition quality life , recruit 75 new subject replace leave study result kidney transplantation , death reason . Hence , investigator estimate study total 1,050 hemodialysis patient 5 year . Clinical event hospital admission survival follow . Blood sample obtain every 6 month measurement hormones `` biomarkers '' , remainder blood store freezer future measurement . The investigator plan design develop race ethnicity specific nutritional risk score food questionnaire test score large national database hemodialysis patient . Almost year study start , investigator also plan additional test body composition dietary intake small group patient GCRC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . SPECIFIC AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESES I.1.HYPOTHESES : Despite high burden chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) minority , great survival compare non-Hispanic Whites CKD . The investigator hypothesize survival advantage minority CKD patient ( pt ) result biologically plausible mechanism related difference nutritional status &amp; diet ( main hypothesis ) differences bone- &amp; -minerals and/or psychosocial &amp; cop status ( 2 alternative hypothesis ) . Differences condition may lead different degree protein-energy wasting , inflammation , oxidative stress , &amp; platelet activation , lead thrombo-embolic &amp; cardiovascular ( CV ) event . Discovering biology CKD racial survival disparity may lead improve outcome CKD others chronic disease . During 5-year study principal investigator ( Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh ) also help number early-career investigator design develop additional study include research minority population chronic disease use data resource study .</detailed_description>
