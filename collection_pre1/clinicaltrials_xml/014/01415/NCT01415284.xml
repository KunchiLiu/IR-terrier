	<brief_title>ED50 Determination Hydroxyethylstarch Treatment Hypotension During Cesarean Section Under Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension pregnant woman undergo cesarean section high . A preoperative fluid bolus undetermined volume frequently administer low incidence maternal hypotension , somewhat poor efficacy . Recently , several investigation show use phenylephrine infusion induction spinal anesthesia result significant reduction hypotensive episode . Given high efficacy therapy ( incidence hypotension around 20 % ) , possible determine effective volume fluid would prevent hypotension 50 % patient study ( ED50 ) . Healthy term pregnant woman undergo elective cesarean section spinal anesthesia recruit trial . The spinal anesthesia regimen standardize subject receive phenylephrine infusion . The fluid investigate hydroxyethylstarch ( HES ) 130/0.4 ( Volulyte ( R ) ) . The ED50 determine use up-down sequential allocation method initially describe Dixon &amp; Massey . The determination HES ED50 help anesthesiologist treat maternal hypotension appropriately .</detailed_description>
