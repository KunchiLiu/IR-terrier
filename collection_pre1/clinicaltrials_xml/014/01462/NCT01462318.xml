	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess immunogenicity Daclizumab High Yield Process ( DAC HYP ) 150 mg administer every 4 week subcutaneous ( SC ) injection use pre-filled syringe ( PFS ) participants relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . The secondary objective study characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) DAC HYP follow single multiple dos DAC HYP administer PFS subset participant RRMS evaluate effect DAC HYP PK probe drug cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoenzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following screen period , participant receive DAC HYP 24-week treatment period ( 6 monthly injection ) enter 20-week washout period assessment immunogenicity , PK , pharmacodynamics , safety , tolerability . The 20-week washout necessary ensure measurement anti-DAC HYP binding antibody ( ADAbs ) neutralize antibody ( NAbs ) absence drug interference . After washout , participant may resume monthly treatment DAC HYP 150 mg additional 3 year . All participant follow 6 month last dose safety monitoring . Additionally , two sub-studies perform : ( 1 ) intensive serial PK sampling perform first last dosing interval follow DAC HYP dos administer week 0 week 20 , ( 2 ) therapeutic protein-drug interaction ( TP-DI ) sub-study , probe drug cocktail administer week 43 53 follow serial probe-drug PK sample 96 hour probe-drug administration . A maximum 20 participant enrol TP-DI sub-study .</detailed_description>
