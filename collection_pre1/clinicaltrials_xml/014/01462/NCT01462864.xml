Phase 2 Once course design , pilot one two group woman PCOS get feedback content delivery . These feedback incorporate course content refresh refine . For mentioned pilot session , patient attend 3.5 hour education session test measurement do . After session view content delivery education seek . We continue run pilot session get new comment .
