Blinded safety available PK data review dose escalation . Part B one cohort examine safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics repeat dose GSK2269557 give nebuliser 7 day healthy male volunteer . The total daily dose , low , dose well tolerate Part A . Part C consist two cohort single nebulised dos healthy male smoker , assess pharmacodynamic endpoint sputum bronchoalveolar lavage .</brief_summary>
