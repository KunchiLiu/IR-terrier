	<brief_summary>A prospective cohort study antiepileptic drug ( AED ) polytherapy-treated epilepsy patient within HealthCore Integrated Research Database ( HIRD ) conduct . Following launch Ezogabine ( EZG ) , patient initiate new AED polytherapy regimen follow early episode urinary retention ( UR ) , change AED regimen , end follow-up , end study ( specify sample size EZG AED polytherapy user attain ) . After end study , incidence UR exposures EZG non-EZG AED polytherapies compare . Polytherapy define treatment regimen contain least two different AEDs . A prospective cohort study patient receive EZG circumstance indicate product label within HIRD also conduct . Following launch EZG , epilepsy patient initiate AED monotherapy EZG well non-epilepsy patient initiate EZG another disease follow early episode UR , change AED regimen ( applicable ) , end follow-up , end study . The incidence UR exposure EZG circumstance indicate product label describe . A descriptive analysis patient also include . To meet secondary objective , non-EZG AED monotherapy user identify prospective cohort incidence UR calculate determine difference UR risk monotherapy polytherapy AED use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epilepsy one common neurological disorder , prevalence active disease 0.3 1.8 % base population-based study across world ( 0.7 % US ) use medical record review . These study estimate approximately 1.4 million current epilepsy patient US alone . Effective seizure control often require long-term exposure compliance various AEDs . Despite advent many new AEDs past 15 year , approximately 30 % epilepsy patient continue experience recurrent seizure due lack treatment efficacy discontinuation therapy due undesirable side effect poor treatment compliance . Therefore , unmet need remain treatment reduce seizure frequency severity well improvement AED tolerability safety . In January 2010 , FDA accept new drug application ( NDA ) EZG adjunctive treatment epilepsy adult partial-onset seizure . US market entry anticipate 2011 . EZG first potassium channel opener reach late stage clinical development treatment epilepsy . EZG 's anticonvulsant property primarily mediate open activate neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel . The efficacy safety EZG part polytherapy AED regimens adult refractory partial-onset seizure demonstrate one Phase II two Phase III double-blind , placebo-controlled trial : RESTORE 1 2 . In Phase II study , 399 patient randomized four treatment arm ( placebo , 600 , 900 , 1200 mg/day EZG ) . The median change baseline seizure frequency 13.1 % placebo group ; comparison , median change 23.4 % 600 mg/day , 29.3 % 900 mg/day ( p=0.0387 ) , 35.2 % 1200 mg/day ( p=0.0024 ) . RESTORE 1 conduct US two arm ( placebo 1200 mg/day EZG ) , RESTORE 2 conduct mainly Europe Australia three different arm ( placebo , 600 , 900 mg/day EZG ) . In RESTORE 1 ( n=301 ) , median reduction seizure frequency among patient use 1200 mg/day EZG ( n=151 ) 44 % compare 18 % among placebo user ( n=150 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . In RESTORE 2 , significant reduction partial seizure frequency find EZG dos vs. placebo ( p &lt; 0.001 ) : 28 % 600 mg/day , 40 % 900 mg/day , 16 % placebo.During trial EZG generally well tolerate ; adverse event ( AEs ) mild moderate central nervous system ( CNS ) relate AEs ( dizziness , somnolence fatigue ) common . However , among non-CNS event , increase incidence bladder-related AEs , include UR , relative placebo observe EZG , primarily 1200 mg/day . Among patient EZG arm trial ( n=813 ) , 0.9 % experienced UR compare 0.5 % placebo arm ( n=427 ) . In addition 5 % patient EZG arm compare 3 % patient placebo arm experience urinary symptom , include dysuria , urinary hesitancy , UR . There concern AEs may reflect inhibition bladder contractility secondary EZG 's effect KCNQ ( Kv7 ) voltage-gated potassium channel detrusor muscle bladder . However , limited number patient expose EZG trial suggest risk UR associate exposure EZG date poorly quantify . A post-marketing safety surveillance study use US health insurance claim database couple medical record review implement determine risk UR associate exposure AED polytherapy regimens contain EZG real-world setting . The risk UR among epilepsy patient treat EZG AED polytherapy compare risk among epilepsy patient treat non-EZG AED polytherapy . In addition , EZG non-EZG AED polytherapy user describe term demographic characteristic , concomitant AED use , co-morbidities , use medication potentially associate UR , medical condition pre-disposing UR . Secondarily , off-label usage EZG monitor describe . In addition , risk UR among epilepsy patient treat non-EZG AED monotherapy determine . The primary objective study quantify risk UR associate exposure EZG AED polytherapy real-world setting . Specific aim include following:1 ) describe patient receive EZG non-EZG AED polytherapy term demographic , concomitant AED use , co-morbidities/past medical history , use medication potentially associate UR , medical condition associate UR ; 2 ) determine magnitude risk time onset UR associate post-marketing use EZG AED polytherapy , determine incremental risk compare non-EZG AED polytherapy use ; 3 ) determine whether risk time onset UR associate non-EZG monotherapy use .</detailed_description>
