	<brief_title>Virtual Integrated Environment Decreasing Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly traumatic limb amputee experience cognizance phantom limb perceive vivid impression lose limb fully present , also painful . The John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Virtual Integration Environment ( VIE ) highly flexible adaptable virtual reality system allow patient observe movement 3D virtual arm . Using VIE , record signal residual limb correlate desired motion phantom limb . We hope correlate consistency pattern PLP determine increase control phantom limb lead decrease PLP .</detailed_description>
