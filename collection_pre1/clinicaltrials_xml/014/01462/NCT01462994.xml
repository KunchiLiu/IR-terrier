	<brief_summary>Activating mutation kinase CKIT PDGFRA detect 90 % case DNA sequence analysis pathological specimen . These mutated genomic DNA fragment highly specific tumor release tumor circulation . Allele-specific PCR use specifically amplify quantify mutate CKIT PDGFR DNA fragment . The current trial aim evaluate whether tumor DNA carry mutation CKIT PDGFRA detect quantified plasma patient active GIST , whether detection correlate clinical course disease either therapy progressive disease irrespective current therapy .</brief_summary>
