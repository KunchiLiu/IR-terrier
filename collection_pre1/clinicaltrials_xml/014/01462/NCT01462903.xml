	<brief_summary>Background : T cell base adoptive immunotherapy include CTL TIL may stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Objective : Phase I clinical trial investigate toxicity immune response therapy autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte adjuvant treatment metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma primary operation , radiotherapy chemotherapy . Methodology : Phase I clinical trial patient advance nasopharyngeal carcinoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , breast cancer solid cancer . The investigator isolate lymphocyte fresh tumor tissue , activate expand TILs vitro ; infuse enough number ( 10e9 10e10 ) TIL back patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Adoptive Immunotherapy With Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor infiltrate lymphocyte isolated tumor tissue tumor biopsy operation . These TILs culture human IL-2 medium 2 3 week , reactivate OKT3 , irradiate feeder cell PBMCs healthy donor LCL set EBV-transformed normal B cell , expand human IL-2 medium another 15 day . 10e9 10e10 TILs yield . The phenotype , function sterile detect TILs infuse patient . After accept operation first round routine chemotherapy radiotherapy , patient treat autologous TILs 10e9-10e10 via intravenous 30 min , q weekX2 week , follow two week daily sc low-dose interleukine-2 . Patients evaluated toxicity immune response . Peripheral blood patient use multimer analysis and/or ELISPOT assay . Additional , able determine anti-tumor effect immunotherapy evaluate clinical response patient stable progressive disease time TILs infusion . Lastly , assess additional tumor marker patient relapsed/refractory disease immunohistochemical stain tumor section previous diagnostic therapeutic biopsy sample determine incidence additional tumor antigen target may use future study .</detailed_description>
