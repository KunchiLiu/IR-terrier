	<brief_summary>Background : A low amount red blood cell blood patient limit kidney function well know problem . Besides lack substance blood like iron erythropoietin shorten survival red blood cell lead low red blood cell count . Red blood cell patient kidney replacement therapy ( dialysis ) die earlier healthy person . They live 70 day compare 120 day healthy human . Today little known cause short survival red blood cell patient dialysis . Because inflammation lead short life red blood cell people suffer several disease lead inflammation would like learn role inflammation shorten life red blood cell dialysis patient . When red blood cell die content broken several substance . One substances gas carbon monoxide ( CO ) . The carbon monoxide exhale breath . The red blood cell die CO exhale . That 's calculate lifespan red blood cell measure amount CO breath time red blood cell count blood . Aim study : We aim learn influence inflammation red blood cell survival dialysis patient . To look factor effect inflammation red blood cell survival , example type dialysis access , medication kind dialysis treatment . Study procedure : Over course 18 month study , 6 observational assessment take place . If patient experience situation increase inflammation study period ( example kind infection intervention ) two study visit take place . Each study visit include blood sampling , perform without need extra needle stick , breath sample order calculate red blood survival measure marker inflammation blood . The breath sample take use easy use GaSampler device develop company call Quintron especially medical breath sampling . In order get sample air patient 's home calculation carbon monoxide produce body ask patient take home open empty plastic bottle study visit . The bottle keep overnight table sideboard apartment . Before leave home hemodialysis clinic visit patient seal plastic bottle top , take dialysis center hand research staff . Risks : The amount additional blood drawn 30 ml ; amount 2 tablespoon , study visit . This harm patient . The breath sample imply risk .</brief_summary>
