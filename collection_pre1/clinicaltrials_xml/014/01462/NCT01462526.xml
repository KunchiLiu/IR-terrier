	<brief_summary>Current screen method glaucoma detection perfect nearly half United States glaucoma go undiagnosed . Minority population even less likely diagnose . Better screen method need identify undiagnosed provide care help retain good vision . Glaucoma often severe one eye fact exploit screening test . The investigator plan use novel screening device accurately record pupillary response eye . It likely patient glaucoma abnormal response measure , compare response two eye investigator able determine glaucoma . If test work well , provide low-cost way screen population risk glaucoma . Furthermore , research expand knowledge base regard pupil response light differ person without glaucoma . Insights gain study useful development effective screening tool detection glaucoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Detection Glaucoma Using Pupillography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma often asymmetric nature , afferent pupillary defect ( APD ) frequently present person glaucoma . The investigator propose conduct clinic-based prospective study ass accuracy use binocular pupillographic device ( RAPiD , Konan Medical , USA ) detect people glaucoma . This device design record analyze pupil responses multiple , controlled stimulus intensity , use vary pattern color stimulus . The asymmetric nature glaucoma suggest high proportion person glaucoma APD ( although many may subtle would miss less refined test method ) . When glaucoma patient severe nerve damage field loss bilateral symmetric , APD may present may small detect . Noting limitation , investigator compare pupillary response stimuli different location ( example superior compare inferior hemifield ) determine whether investigator detect asymmetric glaucoma damage within eye . In addition , likely pupil response glaucoma diminish compare normal , also help detection . Aim1 : To examine amplitude , latency velocity pupil light reflex optimize measurement stimulus various intensity color , characterize variability response normal subject . Aim2 : To quantify amount structural loss ( retinal nerve fiber layer thickness optic nerve head parameter ) functional loss ( visual field mean deviation ) necessary APD ( detect RAPiD ) manifest . Aim3a : To develop algorithm best discriminates without glaucoma individual combine use 1 ) detect APD two eye , 2 ) compare pupil response different part visual field within eye , 3 ) comparing response diseased eye responses `` normal '' eye . Aim 3b : To assess validity algorithm glaucoma detection ass reproducibility pupil response measurement follow-up visit within 7 month .</detailed_description>
