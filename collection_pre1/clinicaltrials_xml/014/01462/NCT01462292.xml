	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Two Doses GSK2402968 Subjects With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Boys Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) suffer relentless , progressive fatal disease due lack dystrophin , critical muscle protein . There currently know cure disease . GSK2402968 think correct several genetic mutation skip exon 51 therefore target boys mutation . A reasonable hypothesis increase dystrophin result clinical improvement , amount dystrophin express correlate clinical improvement threshold level ( e.g . around 30 % control ) . The initial limited efficacy data complete ongoing unblinded study GSK2402968 encourage demonstrate de novo production dystrophin improve walking ability ( primary efficacy endpoint ) 48 week treatment generally well tolerate . This study design explore efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics two dos GSK2402968 give 24 week . The two dos assess 6mg/kg/week 3mg/kg/week . Based pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling , predict steady-state 6 mg/kg/week dose induce dystrophin expression great 30 % control . The 3 mg/kg/week dose choose model predicts 3 mg/kg/week GSK2402968 produce dystrophin expression range 18-22 % . Potential variability subject could theoretically produce high expression lead dystrophin level correlate clinical improvement . Following treatment period , study 24 week post-treatment phase . The purpose post-treatment phase model half-life dystrophin , assess maintenance response , provide information resolution adverse event laboratory abnormality follow cessation treatment .</detailed_description>
