	<brief_title>Study Patients With Stage IV Malignant Melanoma Using PS-341 ( Bortezomib , Velcade ) Interferon-alpha-2b Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : • Determine safety , tolerability DLTs VELCADE administer combination interferon-alpha-2b ( IFN-α-2b ) patient metastatic malignant melanoma . The secondary objective study : - Document objective anti-tumor response may occur response treatment regimen . - Document time tumor progression patient receive treatment regimen . - Measure level cell cycle protein p21 p27 PBMCs tumor biopsy obtain pre-study week 4 Cycle 1 ( Day 26 ) . - Conduct histologic evaluation microvessel density , tumor apoptosis lymphocytic infiltrates within tumor biopsy obtain pre- post-study . - Measure plasma level bFGF VEGF course study . - Monitor effect proteasome inhibition biological activity IFN-α within immune cell measure Jak-STAT signal transduction patient PBMCs .</detailed_description>
