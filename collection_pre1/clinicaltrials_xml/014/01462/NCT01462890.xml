There must plan surgical debulking prior disease progression . Patients stage III IV disease initial surgical debulking appropriate possible still eligible provide patient histological diagnosis debulking surgery prior disease progression foreseen Patients must able commence cytotoxic chemotherapy within 8 week cytoreductive surgery . The first dose bevacizumab omit arm investigator decide start chemotherapy within 4 week surgery . ECOG 02 Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Adequate bone marrow function ( within 14 day prior randomization ) ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L PLT ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hb ≥ 9 g/dL ( posttransfusion ) Adequate coagulation parameter ( within 14 day prior randomization ) Patients receive anticoagulant medication INR ≤ 1.5 aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN The use fulldose oral parenteral anticoagulant permit long INR aPTT within therapeutic limit ( accord institution medical standard ) patient stable dose anticoagulant least two week time randomization .
