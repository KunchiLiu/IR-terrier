	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B form liver disease cause DNA-virus , call hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Infection result inflammation liver parenchyma various clinical manifestation range asymptomatic course jaundice . After contact virus immunological response host determines clinical outcome lead either viral clearance chronic infection . Although several factor responsible development chronic HBV-infection , one factor weak transient CD8+ T-cell response HBV infection . In chronic hepatitis B , inflammation lead scar drive force fibrosis cirrhosis . Some immunological parameter , like newly discover subset IL-17 produce T helper cell ( Th17 cell ) , may influence disease progression HBV . In cirrhotic patient , eventually increase risk hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) lead liver failure . Recent literature Asian patient chronic hepatitis B show serum HBV viral load strong predictor development cirrhosis , independent hepatitis B e- antigen status serum alanine transaminase level . It unclear whether result extrapolate non-Asian ( Caucasian African ) population difference host ( HLA background ) viral ( HBV genotype ) factor . The aim study elucidate question whether historic HBV viral load associate risk HBV-related cirrhosis mortality cohort non-Asian individual chronic hepatitis B infection .</brief_summary>
