	<brief_title>L-BLP25 Patients With Colorectal Carcinoma After Curative Resection Hepatic Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial design patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) , undergone complete resection primary tumor recent resection liver metastasis ( R0 R1 ) curative intent . No generally accept standard care available follow curative-intent resection hepatic metastasis colorectal cancer patient . L-BLP25 cancer vaccine target MUC1 , well know tumor-associated antigen . Recently , show MUC1 associate cellular transformation demonstrate tumorigenicity confer resistance genotoxic agent . High level MUC1 cell surface expression , report immunosuppressive activity release ectodomain , anti-adhesive property contribute ability MUC1 antigen protect promote tumor cell growth survival , make MUC1 attractive target cancer immunotherapy . Based result , L BLP25 may potential adjuvant therapy curative resection hepatic metastasis colorectal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
