	<brief_summary>Zanamivir neuraminidase inhibitor demonstrate effectiveness pandemic H1N1 virus . Zanamivir first authorize Sweden June 1999 approve European Union ( EU ) mutual recognition . It indicate treatment prevention influenza adult child age 5 year . Zanamivir animal study , conduct primarily rabbit , show trend towards increase post-implantation loss , decrease fetal body weight , increase minor fetal skeletal change , although effect statistically significant . Given frequency , pattern distribution effect , conclude related zanamivir treatment . The summary product characteristic zanamivir state use pregnancy unless potential benefit mother justifies risk fetus . Postmarketing data show high risk malformation oseltamivir general population , data zanamivir scarcer . Limited data available pregnancy outcome maternal exposure zanamivir pregnancy . From 01 August 2003 31 January 2009 , 133 woman report treated zanamivir pregnant . Of 133 pregnancy , 83 pregnancy on-going lose follow-up ( 62.4 % ) time report ; 43 result live birth apparent congenital anomaly ( 32.3 % ) , 4 represent spontaneous abortion apparent congenital anomaly ( 3.0 % ) , 2 elective termination apparent congenital anomaly ( 1.5 % ) , 1 ectopic pregnancy ( &lt; 1 % ) . The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) conclude exposure zanamivir pregnancy represent new safety risk fetus . Published research suggest early antiviral treatment pregnant H1N1 patient improve outcome . In Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) surveillance population 788 pregnant influenza patient disease onset April August 2009 , 384 data time antiviral treatment observe significantly high risk adverse outcomes later treatment ( 'intermediate ' , i.e . 3-4 day , n=84 ; 'late ' , i.e . &gt; 4 day : n=81 ) early treatment ( &lt; 2 day : n=219 ) . Compared give early treatment , give intermediate treatment almost 10 time risk death , give late treatment , 50 time . Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission show 2-fold risk elevation intermediate treatment six-fold elevation late treatment , Respective elevation risk need mechanical ventilation almost 4-fold 12-fold . The author note reason treatment delay population unknown , could include reluctance part clinicians patient expose fetus antiviral medication , well use rapid influenza test , show low ( 10 % -70 % ) sensitivity H1N1 . As part ongoing epidemiologic safety monitor initiative request EMA influenza pandemic 2009-2010 , GSK seek conduct pregnancy safety study well understand safety zanamivir woman expose pregnancy either treatment prevention influenza . This safety study collect information exist European database record pregnant woman expose product pregnancy outcome order ass safety treatment population . GSK work PPD contract research organization ( CRO ) oversee conduct study , include data source management payment , study design input , epidemiological advice , data transfer oversight overall project management . The CRO keep record relevant personnel involve study . Additionally , PPD strategic alliance World Health Information Science Consultants , LLC ( WHISCON ) ( www.whiscon.com ) , internationally recognize organization conduct post-approval drug safety risk management epidemiology . WHISCON provide service relate protocol development well database-specific work plan , assist analysis interpretation data . The primary objective study evaluate safety zanamivir take pregnancy 1 ) outcome pregnancy , 2 ) congenital anomaly identifiable shortly birth , 3 ) treatment-emergent diagnose mother occur within 28 day receipt zanamivir . The secondary objective study 1 ) develop technique identify influenza-like illness ( ILI ) participate data source , 2 ) identify characteristic zanamivir recipient .</brief_summary>
