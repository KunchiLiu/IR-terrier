	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine genetic component phantom limb pain . DNA analyze single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) control phantom limb pain group . Total RNA also isolate profiled ass degree gene ( ) interest express presence absence phantom limb pain . Some protein , inflammatory antibody neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , also assess association ( ) phantom limb pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Identify Genetic Variations Associated With Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient ( 90-95 % ) major limb amputation experience phantom limb -- vivid impression limb still present . In many case , sensation painful reason currently well understood . A small subset amputee ( &lt; 10 % ) never experience phantom limb pain ( PLP ) , painful sensation felt amputated limb . This difference suggest may genetic component precludes patient ever experience PLP . Understanding genetic component PLP may help predict patient experience PLP amputees respond various treatment option available . In order understand genetic aspect ultimately develop effective treatment option future , patient without PLP ask give 30 ml blood overnight fasting . These blood sample de-identified send National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Bethesda , Maryland , genetic analysis take place .</detailed_description>
