	<brief_summary>In July 2008 , lapatinib ( Tykerb ) Prescribing Information ( label ) update include boxed warning relate hepatotoxcity detail instruction monitor liver function lapatanib exposure . For patient safety , interest know extent provider adherent guideline hepatic monitoring lapatanib user . Thus , aim study determine physician conduct liver function test prior prescribe lapatanib regular interval exposure , withdraw lapatanib , re-treat , patient demonstrate severe liver enzyme elevation expose . These aim test `` Pre-label '' ( prior boxed warn ) `` Post-label '' ( boxed warn ) period determine physician adherence guideline change result warning . Specifically , box warn provide follow guidance : `` Hepatotoxicity ( alanine transaminase aspartate transaminase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ) observe clinical trial ( &lt; 1 % patient ) postmarketing experience . The hepatotoxicity may severe death report . Causality death uncertain . The hepatotoxicity may occur day several month initiation treatment . Liver function test ( transaminase , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ) monitor initiation treatment , every 4 6 week treatment , clinically indicate . If change liver function severe , therapy lapatanib discontinue patient re-treated lapatanib '' The following objective assess compare among patient prescribe lapatanib addition detail guidance liver function test product label July 9 , 2008 : 1 . Objective 1 : Determine physicians perform liver funtion test ( LFTs ) prior prescribe lapatanib ( baseline ) 2 . Objective 2 : Describe prevalence LFT elevation baseline 3 . Objective 3 : Determine physician routinely perform LFTs duration lapatanib exposure 4 . Objective 4 : Describe cumulative incidence incidence rate LFT elevation lapatanib exposure 5 . Objective 5 : Describe patient experience severe LFT elevation lapatanib exposure calculate proportion lapatanib discontinue re-treated To achieve objective , observational retrospective cohort study conduct use United States Oncology Electronic Medical Records database . The study population consist female diagnosis metastatic breast cancer document order Lapatanib January 1 , 2007 - December 31 , 2009 . Patients categorize whether initiated Lapatanib July 9 , 2008 label change . 'Pre Label ' : Initiated lapatanib January 1 , 2007 December 31 , 2007 . Follow-up time group continue June 30 , 2008 allow patient least six month follow-up time prior label change . 'Post Label ' : Initiated lapatanib July 9 , 2008 December 31 , 2009 . Follow-up time group continue June 30 , 2010 allow patient least six month follow-up . The exposure study lapatanib oral medication . The date initiation lapatanib index date . Lapatanib exposure period ( ) define index date end study period ( June 30 , 2008 pre-label group June 30 , 2010 post-label group ) . The project use proportion two estimate incidence ( cumulative incidence incidence rate use person-time ) describe outcomes interest among user Lapatanib label change . The following LFTs consider : - alanine transaminase ( ALT ) - aspartate transaminase ( AST ) - alkaline phosphatise ( ALP )</brief_summary>
