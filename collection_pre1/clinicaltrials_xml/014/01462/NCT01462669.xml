	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate pharmacokinetics single oral dos ezogabine/retigabine primary metabolite ( NAMR ) healthy male female Taiwanese volunteer . Subjects receive four separate dos ezogabine/retigabine tablet : 50 mg , 100 mg , 200 mg 400 mg administer orally . Blood sample obtain pre-defined timepoints duration study determine concentration ezogabine/retigabine NAMR . Safety assessment include measurement vital sign , collection adverse event , clinical laboratory test Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale .</brief_summary>
