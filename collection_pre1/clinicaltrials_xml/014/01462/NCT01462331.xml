	<brief_title>Dietary Effects VitaSugar/VitaFiber-IMO Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Isomalto-oligosaccharide ( IMO ) mixture natural resistant carbohydrate consist short-chains glucose molecule . IMO make enzymatic conversion starch use health food ingredient health benefit low calorie sweetener , prebiotic dietary fiber . IMO ingest human last many century naturally find rice miso , sake soy sauce . IMO already get approval FDA ( GRAS ) Health Canada . There number publish study ( human animal ) regard health benefit IMO effective prebiotic , role improve overall human gastric health . Studies also show IMO find tolerable least adverse effect compare short-chain resistant oligosaccharide . Current clinical study conduct verify give health benefit BioNeutra 's manufacture VitaSugar/VitaFiber-IMO product include quantitative analysis Bifidobacteria spp. , Lactic acid bacteria group clostridium spp . The production short-chain fatty-acids ( SCFA ) effect blood glucose level also analyze addition dose tolerance term low upper permissible dosage resultant adverse effect also observe .</detailed_description>
