	<brief_summary>Based assumption honey may immunomodulatory effect , aim present study verify whether intake honey , natural substance , patient chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) could affect platelet number hence could affect bleed severity . Thirty patient suffer chronic ITP recruit Hematology Clinic Pediatric Hospital Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt . The diagnosis ITP base presence isolate thrombocytopenia peripheral blood platelet count le 100 x 109/L , absence obvious initiate and/or underlying cause thrombocytopenia .

The subject randomize two group ( intervention control [ I/C ] control intervention [ C/I ] group ) . Each study group 15 subject . The subject I/C group consume 2 ml honey/kg/dose ( maximum 50 ml/dose ) , twice weekly first 12-week period ( period 1 ) subject C/I group receive honey Control period 1 . After period 1 subject group exchange protocol follow 12-week period ( period 2 ) . This design allow treatment effect measure study group ( namely different subject ) study period , period 1 , well subject crossover comparison period 1 2 .</detailed_description>
