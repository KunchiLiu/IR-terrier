	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent , Refractory , Progressive Malignant Glioma Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate ( partial response [ PR ] complete response [ CR ] ≥ 8 week ) sunitinib 2 stratum ( recurrent/progressive/refractory high-grade glioma v ependymoma ) recurrent progressive brain tumor pediatric young adult patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore report descriptively safety tolerability sunitinib pediatric young adult brain tumor patient receive prior anthracycline radiotherapy involve heart . II . To describe pharmacokinetic profile pediatric young adult patient take sunitinib malate . III . To describe cumulative toxicity sunitinib administer multiple course pediatric young adult patient . IV . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) distribution cohorts patient . V. To evaluate change phosphorylation PDGFR-α -β , MEK/ERK , S6 kinase , AKT peripheral blood mononuclear cell explore possible association change outcome measure . VI . To evaluate plasma level soluble isoforms VEGFR-1 -2 prior initiation therapy point therapy exploration possible biomarkers clinical response . VII . To evaluate report descriptively expression ratio VEGF isoforms tumor tissue , available . VIII . To evaluate report descriptively genotype , expression , possible amplification KIT PDGFR-α -β tumor tissue , available . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline course 1 2 pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Tissue sample diagnosis surgical resection may also collect . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
