	<detailed_description>The deterioration musculoskeletal system occur age major cause loss autonomy directly affect quality life individual . Support appropriate rehabilitation patient 's return home essential . It require physiotherapy assessment , include , among thing , joint assessment measure passive range motion . Physical therapist different technique achieve measure , benefit ( time , reliability ) disadvantage . Among , goniometer inclinometer technical reference The main objective study validate MotionPod software BioVal valid tool measure range motion elbow joint geriatric assessment . Secondary objective study reproducibility measurement time ease use The measurement range motion elbow degree , estimate actigraphy software BioVal compare obtain inclinometer . The movement examine successively flexion , extension , pronation supination . The proportion valid measurement calculate movement . The confidence interval 95 % partner also calculate . Moreover , order judge validity actigraphy measure , investigator calculate proportion patient measure valid four movement confidence interval 95 % partner . 85 patient age 65 year recruit Cimiez hospital CHU Nice , service short , medium long geriatric stay</detailed_description>
