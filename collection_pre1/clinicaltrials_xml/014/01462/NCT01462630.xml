	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) 3 month response rate define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) angiosarcoma patient treat pazopanib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival patient treat pazopanib . II . To gather safety data pazopanib patient population . III . To explore ability [ F-18 ] fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) ( positron emission tomography [ PET ] ) /computed tomography ( CT ) image assess response . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
