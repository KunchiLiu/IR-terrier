	<brief_summary>Recently isolate low PA variety ( lpa ) wheat , rice , maize , barley bean might potential alleviate iron bioavailability problem associate PA . These plant normal phosphate level , reduce PA phosphate due various modification biosynthetic pathway PA . So far lpa crop early stage development , exhibit reduced yield seed germination . However , lpa bean isolated Campion co-worker 2009 chemical mutagenesis exhibit 10 % native bean PA concentration without defect term growth yield . Crossing lpa variety bean variety low PP high iron might lead development variety potential improve iron status bean consuming population . The follow study evaluate relative impact PA PP iron absorption bean compare iron absorption four different bean variety . Iron absorption bean normal PA concentration high PP concentration compare iron absorption bean normal PA low PP concentration well two lpa variety , one high one low PP concentration .</brief_summary>
