	<brief_summary>The main purpose study investigate effect veliparib ovarian cancer patient know BRCA 1/2 mutation longer respond conventional chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib Monotherapy Relapsed Ovarian Cancer With BRCA Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The side effect modest , since PARP inhibitor affect cancer cell much large extent normal cell . The effect PARP-inhibiting treatment evident although great effect see patient mutation BRCA gene . The reason BRCA deficient cancer cell unable repair DNA double strand single strand break undergo apoptosis large extent .</detailed_description>
