	<brief_summary>The goal study develop `` bedside bench '' model clinical biological predictor toxicity adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy older adult breast cancer . The investigator develop predictive model use clinical biological predictor toxicity adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy older adult breast cancer . The investigator also determine association clinical biological factor reduce relative dose intensity prescribe chemotherapy regimen . In addition , investigator explore specific chemotherapy toxicity associate reduced relative dose intensity prescribe regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Biological Predictors Chemotherapy Toxicity Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although cancer disease associate age , standard tool oncology practice incorporate clinical biological factor identify old adult cancer may vulnerable toxicity chemotherapy . It generally recognize chronological age tell relatively little old adult 's physiological age . Oncologists allude describe old adult : `` 'young ' 80-year-old '' `` 'old ' 80-year-old , '' imply factor age contribute health status old adult . Geriatricians address routinely perform `` geriatric assessment , '' measure independent clinical predictor morbidity mortality old adult . In addition , several potential biomarkers age describe associated functional decline mortality among old adult . This study identify whether novel biomarkers age predict risk chemotherapy toxicity . The current proposal fill knowledge gap meld principle geriatrics oncology create tool assess clinical biological risk factor chemotherapy toxicity old adult . Furthermore , study determine association chemotherapy toxicity dose reduction and/or delay decrease chemotherapy dose intensity . Maintenance chemotherapy dose intensity necessary maintain chemotherapy efficacy . Older adult risk chemotherapy toxicity toxicity result decrease dose intensity , benefit chemotherapy compromise . This study identify association clinical biological predictor grade 2-5 toxicity relative dose intensity . Furthermore , study identify specific dose-limiting toxicity . These data provide evidence-based criterion identify patient whose project risk toxicity would limit dose intensity compromise efficacy standard treatment . These data could serve basis `` vulnerable elderly trial '' would study alternate therapy regimen patient predict significant risk toxicity ( compromised efficacy ) standard regimen . This proposal unite field geriatrics oncology , incorporate geriatric correlate vulnerability study impact age oncology population . These data use develop predictive equation risk chemotherapy toxicity utilized daily oncology practice . These data facilitate decision-making regard risk benefit adjuvant chemotherapy older adult breast cancer ultimately serve foundation identify old adult risk chemotherapy toxicity order guide intervention decrease risk .</detailed_description>
