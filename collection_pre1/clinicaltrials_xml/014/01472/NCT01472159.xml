	<detailed_description>Consistent CGM use youth T1D difficult sustain historically . Youth T1D family routinely felt burden relate introduction technology care management . Additionally , difficulty calibration , skin irritation , frequent skip , excessive nuisance alarm inaccurate reading often lead diminish use discontinuation entirely . The purpose protocol implement evaluate family-focused behavioral teamwork intervention aim overcome barrier sustain CGM use youth T1D . In 2-year RCT , assess long-term acceptability durability CGM use associate glycemic psychological outcome youth T1D family . We randomize 120 family one two group : ( 1 ) CGM implement accord usual care ( CGM-Usual Care , CGM-UC ) ( 2 ) CGM implement family teamwork intervention ( CGM-Teamwork , CGM-TW ) . This intervention allow participant family overcome barrier sustain CGM use achieve glycemic benefit afford adult use CGM demonstrate research . In year 1 , CGM supply provide covered study resource . In year 2 , study participant ask cover cost associate sensor use cost associate replacement CGM component manner consistent routine clinical care investigator believe important ass durability CGM use clinical practice .</detailed_description>
