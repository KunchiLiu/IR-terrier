	<brief_summary>Continuous accurate unobtrusive respiratory rate monitoring may lead improved patient outcome , respiratory rate think sensitive marker patient deterioration . Currently system suitable long term monitoring , particularly ambulant patient restrictive . To ensure algorithm suitable use clinical context need demonstrate performance optimal situation , healthy volunteer rest , also challenge situation person monitor move also patient condition may affect physiology way accuracy respiration rate estimation may affect . No previous study systematically test algorithms derive respiratory rate either ECG photoplethysmography ( PPG ) waveforms real -world setting . The algorithms work look change interval heartbeat also change size ECG PPG waveform , may cause respiration . These change tend diminish increase age also condition alter chest movement cardiac reflex . Thus important test algorithm ' accuracy participant exhibit condition . It also important ensure calculation respiratory rate accurate across range heart rate respiratory rate . Our test cover variable .</brief_summary>

Older Healthy Volunteers Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male Female , age 70 year . Patients Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male Female , age 1870 year old . Participant one follow condition : Atrial fibrillation A permanent pacemaker continuously active Reduced chest wall movement Young Healthy Volunteers Any condition might increase risk exercise test Any history ischaemic heart disease Any history heart failure Any structural heart disease ( eg : valvular lesion , hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ) Any abnormality rest ECG Deep vein thrombosis diagnose within last 6 month active treatment Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 220 mm Hg , diastolic &gt; 120 mm Hg ) Aortic aneurysm Aortic cardiovascular surgery within 6 month recruitment A family history sudden cardiac death , congenital arrhythmia syndrome cardiomyopathy Autonomic dysfunction , either previously diagnose upon test research team Any condition involve brain spinal cord Diabetes Alcohol consumption &gt; 21 units/week woman 28 units/week men history previous alcohol dependence . Acute kidney injury Chronic kidney disease stage 4 5 Any condition cause hepatic dysfunction Presence permanent pacemaker ( participant would eligible pacemaker group ) Reduced chest wall movement ( participant would eligible reduce chest movement group ) Any acute infection require antibiotic treatment within 3 month recruitment Any surgery illness require hospitalisation within 3 month recruitment Currently take medication exception analgesic oral contraceptive pill . Any wound skin condition affect torso may affect application adhesive ECG dot skin Pregnancy Inability give inform consent Older Healthy Volunteers Any diagnose condition primarily affect cardiovascular respiratory system Symptomatic autonomic dysfunction Orthostatic hypotension Any condition involve brain spinal cord Diabetes Alcohol consumption &gt; 21 units/week woman 28 units/week men history previous alcohol dependence . Acute kidney injury Chronic kidney disease stage 4 5 Any condition cause hepatic dysfunction Presence permanent pacemaker Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Any muscular dystrophy Kyphosis Scoliosis Pectus excavatum Any disease involve lung pleura Any acute infection require antibiotic treatment within 3 month recruitment Any surgery illness require hospitalisation within 3 month recruitment Currently take medication exception analgesic oral contraceptive pill . Any wound skin condition affect torso may affect application adhesive ECG dot skin Pregnancy Inability give informed consent Patients Any infection would require isolation barrier nurse accord hospital 's infection control policy Any wound skin condition affect torso may affect application adhesive ECG dot skin Requirement form artificial ventilatory support , include oxygen therapy More one inclusion criterion . ( ie : patient may atrial fibrillation reduce chest wall movement eligible study ) Inability give inform consent</criteria>
