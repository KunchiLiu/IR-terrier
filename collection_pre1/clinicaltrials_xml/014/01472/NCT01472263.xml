	<brief_summary>In study investigator go evaluate efficacy pentoxifyline HTLV-1 patient neurological disease : HAM/TSP neurogenic bladder . In laboratory experiment investigator observe drug capacity reduce immune response HTLV-1 infected cell . Since exacerbate immune response know cause neurological disease patient HTLV-1 investigator hope pentoxifyline alleviate symptom delay progress HAM/TSP patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Pentoxifylline Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type-1 ( HTLV-1 ) Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infect 20 million individual worldwide causative agent HTLV associate myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . Although 5 % HTLV-infected individual develop HAM/TSP , investigatorts observe 30 % neurological complaint and/or neurogenic bladder associate HTLV-1 . The immunopathogenesis diseases relate exaggerated immune response high production cytokine induce neurological injury . So far effective drug HTLV-1 modulation immune response help alleviate clinical manifestation patient prevent progression symptom . The preliminary data show pentoxifylline ability decrease production TNF-α IFN-γ patient HTLV-1 infection patient HAM/TSP . The proposal entitle `` Evaluation efficacy pentoxifylline attenuate neurological disease associate HTLV-1 negatively modulate immune pathological response '' extend previous study order determine ability pentoxifylline modulate immune response modify course clinical manifestation patient infect HTLV-1 . The influence immune response expression disease determine therapeutic trial two group patient : 1 ) patient neurogenic bladder associate HTLV-1 , 2 ) patient HAM/TSP . Primary end point clinical neurological exam secondary end point measure proinflammatory cytokine ( TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-1 IL-6 ) chemokines attract T cell sit inflammation ( CXCL9 CXCL10 ) .</detailed_description>
