	<brief_summary>This clinical trial feasibility study assess performance Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device use Artificial Pancreas System ( APS© ) platform subject type 1 diabetes . The device closed-loop DexCom™ SEVEN® PLUS ( DexCom™ Corp , San Diego , CA ) continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) OneTouch® Ping® Glucose Monitoring System ( Animas Corp , Westchester , PA ) subcutaneous insulin delivery pump ( CSII ) . The AP device control zone-Model Predictive Control ( zone-MPC ) algorithm augment safety algorithm name Health Monitoring System ( HMS ) . The clinical study include 12 20 adult subject age 21 65 year old .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist evaluation Artificial Pancreas device 24-hour closed-loop clinic environment ( Sansum Diabetes Research Institute , Santa Barbara , CA ) . The 24-hour period include : - 2 unannounced meal ( even dinner breakfast ) ; - 1 period 30 minute exercise 50 % predicted heart rate reserve ( HRR ) precede snack follow snack 3 hour later ( Day 2 ) ; - complete night 12:00 7:00 ; The subject arrive approximately 4:00 pm CRC ( clinical research center ) , closed-loop initiate approximately 4:30 pm day continue 4:30 pm next day . A physician monitoring patient artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device time . The propose study evaluate performance AP device predict fall rise glucose value regulate insulin delivery mitigate extreme blood glucose variation follow challenge : - follow unannounced meal , - nocturnal period , - period active exercise . The goal demonstrate AP device able maintain subject blood glucose within safe range time . One objectives study measure percent time spend follow zone : - [ 80-140 ] mg/dL time unless described otherwise - [ 80-140 ] mg/dL nocturnal period - [ 70-180 ] mg/dL postprandial , 5 hour follow unannounced meal - [ 70-150 ] mg/dL 3 hour follow exercise It anticipate follow plan challenge , glucose value might increase temporarily beyond range . These excursion review analyze ( value duration ) study determine AP device mitigates excursion maintains glucose level within safe acceptable range . The clinical study also review event occur course 24-hour closed-loop : hypoglycemic event , hyperglycemic event , outside intervention , Adverse Event , Serious Adverse Events , Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect , device complaint commercial device use . The safety patient remain primary goal . The goal AP device operate without outside intervention even challenge meal exercise unless outside intervention request Health Monitoring System ( HMS ) .</detailed_description>

Diabetic ketoacidosis past 6 month prior enrollment require emergency room visit hospitalization Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 12 month prior enrollment Current treatment seizure disorder ; Subjects history seizure may include study receive write clearance neurologist Cystic fibrosis Active infection A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol cognitive deficit . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , include subject able read write . Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month either subject subject 's primary care giver ( i.e. , parent guardian ) Coronary artery disease heart failure . Subjects history coronary artery disease may include study receive write clearance cardiologist Presence know adrenal disorder Active coronary artery disease heart failure Active gastroparesis If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Uncontrolled thyroid disease . Adequately treated thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment Abuse alcohol A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication disease judgment investigator affect completion exercise protocol Current use beta blocker medication Laboratory result : Hematocrit &lt; 30 % &gt; 55 % A1C &gt; 10 % Abnormal liver renal function ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) Labs drawn screen visit within one month prior screen ( purpose ) suffice enrollment purpose related hematocrit Subject skin condition , determination investigator , would preclude wear study device ( infusion set sensor ) , abdomen . Examples include limited : psoriasis , burn , scar , eczema , tattoo , significant hypertrophy site device wear ; know allergy medical adhesive .
