	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The investigator postulate patient Wilson disease asymptomatic effectively treat symptom maintenance phase therapy safely effectively treat single daily dosage chelate agent trientine . Specific Aims : To demonstrate single daily treatment trientine effective well patient 's current maintenance therapy . This accomplished performance case control prospective study patient prior therapy , period treatment single weight base dose regimen trientine . The primary endpoint study demonstration equivalence patient 's prior therapy . Secondary endpoint include : 1 ) demonstration stability improvement parameter copper metabolism ; 2 ) improvement adherence therapy ; 3 ) progression liver disease ( define change synthetic function , albumin INR , fibrosis Fibrotest ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Daily Dosage Trientine Maintenance Treatment Wilson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wilson disease genetic disorder copper metabolism inherit autosomal recessive fashion afflicts ~1/30,000 individual . Treatment individual consist medical therapy , life-long , liver transplantation . Medical therapy utilizes chelate agent , penicillamine trientine , zinc , give multiple daily dosage ( 1 ) . It estimate ~10-50 % individual period non-adherence therapy life-time . The consequence non-adherence include liver injury , liver failure , neurological impairment death . Some non-adherent individual rescue reinstitution medical therapy , others require liver transplantation ( 1-4 ) . In addition human suffering engender advance individual disease suffer non-adherence , physical mental disability suffer need liver transplantation add greatly cost life-time care . Simplifying current treatment regimen long-term maintenance therapy Wilson disease improve patient adherence . This translate positive long-term benefit patient , caregiver support , society whole . Current maintenance therapy Wilson disease include chelate agent penicillamine trientine , zinc . Multiple daily dosage ( three four ) recommend early study medication , manufacturer treat physician ( 1,5-8 ) . As noted , patient adherence treatment , particular multiple daily dosage often incomplete . There increase treatment common disorder medication administer single daily dosage . As example , anti-hypertensives antidepressant available extended release formulation , make single daily dosage possible . None currently available agent treatment Wilson disease comparable formulation . Furthermore , even extend release oral formulation available , certain would effective . In extended release formulation , site absorption medication may sustain adequately , bind ingest food may interfere function . The choice trientine single agent use study come personal experience Principal Investigator ' use clinical set clinical trial ( 1 , 9 ) . This drug excellent safety profile effective remove copper body give apart meal ( 1,4,10 ) . Previous study show effectiveness copper removal administration multiple daily dosage ( 10,11 ) . The amount copper excrete urine patient daily basis dosage dependent , also dependent phase treatment . In initial treatment period , large efflux copper urine patient treated chelation agent , time amount decrease . For example , patient maintain d-penicillamine initially may excrete one milligram copper 24 hour period , time excrete ~250 mcg copper per day . Similarly , patient maintain trientine single therapy may excrete slightly less comparable amount copper ( 11 ) . In trial trientine neurological disease , amount free serum copper urine copper stable end initial 8 week period patient ( 9 ) . Once equilibrium achieve respect copper balance liver function stabilize , maintenance therapy gear towards small net negative removal copper daily basis . Therefore , adequate copper removal possible achieve appropriate dosage trientine give daily since know dose response trientine copper excretion . Supportive evidence suggest single daily dosage propose study effective therapy recently obtain review three individual case study . These three patient , two follow principal investigator ( MLS ) third know follow locally , report take trientine single daily dosage . Two patient present neurological Wilson disease , third presymptomatic patient identify family screen ; year initial treatment . Two three change regimen day treatment without advice physician due difficulty take multiple dosage work hour interference take medication , third advice another physician . Each patient use single dose therapy year ( range 2-15 ) . Laboratory data individual demonstrate normal liver function good copper control , examination show clinically stable . All three previously treat d- Penicillamine trientine multiple daily dosage . Experimental Design &amp; Methods : Experimental design : Patients meet inclusion criterion ask consent participate study entry clinical trial . Patients evaluate prior start study Principal Investigator co-investigator document medical history physical exam finding . Initial lab study perform determine current status patient 's liver disease copper balance . A history obtain treatment Wilson disease , patient ask complete pre-study questionnaire . Blood urine study prior entry include : CBC platelet ; Liver function panel ( AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , direct bilirubin , GGPT , albumin ) , INR , serum copper , serum ceruloplasmin , ANA titer , ESR , pregnancy test , 24 hour urine copper zinc volume , urinalysis non-invasive test liver fibrosis ( Fibrotest , Prometheus ) A questionnaire administer prior entry study end study period . This questionnaire design focus patient use current medication , end period , determine whether day regimen useful intervention . For first part study ( 3 month ) , patient observe current therapy lab perform prior study entry monthly baseline measurement liver function copper status . Subsequently , throughout remainder study period , patient give Trientine dosage ~15 mg/kg round upwards near 250 300 mg single daily dosage . The entire daily dosage take AM hour meal . Patients monitor monthly first three month , thereafter , every third month repeat blood urine testing note , exception Fibrotest , ANA ESR administer study drug give , 12 month later . This interval monitoring exceeds frequency patient normally see maintenance therapy , varies 3-6 month interval upper limit patient good adherence past therapy . Patients examine begin trial , 3 month give study drug , 6 12 month treatment ( end trial ) . A monthly study log keep patient record medication administration adverse effect treatment , send study coordinator . For long-term follow-up , patient may visit Dr. Schilsky clinic 6 month interval ten year ( routine interval follow-up care patient Wilson disease maintenance therapy ) standard care lab test perform . The patient ask fill short questionnaire , data visit collect recorded case report form . If patient unable travel study site , questionnaire fill telephone interview laboratory request may send patient test physical examination do locally . Results test evaluation forward site review data entry . The study pharmacy dispense medication visit third month monitoring ( prior initial start medication ) , thereafter 90 day interval . All unused medication return study pharmacy . Methodology Study Group : Patients establish diagnosis Wilson disease treat disease least one year , compensate liver disease and/or stable neurological psychiatric disease . Biochemical testing must demonstrate normal minimal elevation serum ALT ( &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ) non-ceruloplasmin copper &lt; 25 mcg/dl . Patients must willing participate 15 month time period undergo initial monthly blood urine test determine baseline current therapy , interval test 12 month . A pilot study 5 patient propose , large study follow pending review initial pilot data .</detailed_description>
