	<detailed_description>This protocol randomize , control blinded clinical trial obese non-obese subject diagnose breast cancer test effect vitamin D supplementation neoadjuvant set evaluate change biomarker expression blood tissue compare core breast biopsy definitive surgical sample . Our goal determine whether dietary vitamin D reverse negative effect obesity insulin resistance reflect favorable change gene expression pattern pathologic specimen well serum biomarkers insulin resistance adipokine secretion . We expect vitamin D administration improve breast cancer gene expression pattern high-risk configuration low-risk profile obese patient also cause improvement non-obese .</detailed_description>
