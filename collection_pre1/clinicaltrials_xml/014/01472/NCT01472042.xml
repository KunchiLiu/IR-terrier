	<brief_title>A Evaluation Of Biomarkers Associated With Sports Induced Concussions In College Student Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concussion mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) condition affect hundred thousand patient worldwide . It biomechanically induce neurological injury , result alteration mental status , confusion amnesia , may may involve loss consciousness . Concussion affect 1.6 million 3.8 million athlete yearly , commonly contact sport American football boxing . Early clinical effect concussion include limited behavioral change , impairment memory attention , headache , unsteadiness , rarely , catastrophic severe brain injury ( sometimes describe second impact syndrome ) . More recently , consequence repetitive mTBI multiple concussion sport set become evident . Repeated concussion associate great severity symptom , long recovery time , chronically early onset age-related memory disturbance dementia . As result contradistinction decades-earlier perception injury benign , sport medicine professional increasingly instruct recognize manage concussion soon occur . `` Understanding neurobiology concussion lead development validation physiological biomarkers common injury . '' These biomarkers ( e.g. , laboratory test , image , electrophysiology ) allow improve detection , good functional assessment evidence-based return play recommendation .</detailed_description>
