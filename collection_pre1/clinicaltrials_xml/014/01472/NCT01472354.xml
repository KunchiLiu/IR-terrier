	<brief_title>Feasibility Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Decision-Making Intervention Among HIV-infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection major problem Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -infected patient . Without HCV treatment , increase number HIV positive patient die either end stage liver disease HIV-related complication inability use antiretroviral agent due hepatotoxicity . Major advance understand HCV treatment population occur within past several year . Yet , small proportion co-infected patient receive HCV treatment ( approximately 15 % ) . Moreover , study explore patient decision-making related HCV treatment HIV co-infected patient . The major gap knowledge best support patient engage HCV treatment decision make process health care provider . Therefore , purpose phase II study test feasibility conduct theoretically-derived group intervention HIV/HCV co-infected adult support active engagement HCV treatment decision-making . The primary aim : ( 1 ) determine feasibility recruit retain sample HIV/HCV co-infected adult complete protocol involve randomization 4-week HCV Positive Life Skills group intervention usual care completion two data collection interview ( baseline week 12 ) , ( 2 ) establish preliminary effect size HCV Positive Life Skills group intervention HCV knowledge , decisional conflict , patient-provider communication , health-related quality life , symptom experience engagement health care provider , ( 3 ) explore capacity group intervention influence HCV knowledge , decisional conflict , patient-provider communication , engagement health care provider , health relate quality life symptom experience ( 4 ) describe component intervention usual care ( qualitative interview ) useful help HIV/HCV co-infected patient engage decision-making HCV treatment . A mixed method approach use . 50 HIV/HCV co-infected participant randomize equally receive either group intervention usual care . Then qualitative interview , use qualitative descriptive method , conduct 10-12 participant identify salient part intervention usual care support effective decision-making HCV treatment . The investigator also compare time spend group , identify variability control condition , describe number subject start HCV treatment refine intervention manual intervention fidelity procedure preparation full scale multi-site randomized clinical trial .</detailed_description>
