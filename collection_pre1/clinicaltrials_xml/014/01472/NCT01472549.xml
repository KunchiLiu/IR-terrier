	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize controlled clinical trial determine comparative effectiveness chlorhexidine-alcohol iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation prevent surgical site infection cesarean section . While estimate vary , surgical site infection complicate 5 - 10 % cesarean section result significant human suffer excess health care cost . Interventions preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infection 60 % , rate infection remain high . There therefore great need identify test potential intervention reduce infection . The skin major source pathogen cause surgical site infection . Therefore , optimize preoperative skin antisepsis potential decrease postoperative surgical site infection . There paucity evidence guide choice antiseptic skin preparation cesarean section . To date , two underpowered trial publish compare two method preoperative skin preparation cesarean section . A recent randomized trial adult undergo clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedure demonstrate 41 % reduction surgical site infection use chlorhexidine-alcohol compare commonly use povidone-iodine . While plausible finding trial clean-contaminated surgical procedure may apply cesarean section , physiological change pregnancy , peculiar dual microbial source cesarean-related infection hormone-mediated immune-modulation pregnancy make validity extrapolation uncertain . The study follow specific aim : Primary Aim : To test hypothesis preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation cesarean section significantly reduce surgical site infection compare iodine-alcohol . Secondary Aim 1 : To test hypothesis preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation cesarean section significantly reduce bacterial contamination surgical site compare iodine-alcohol . Secondary Aim 2 : To determine clinical outcome medical cost associate cesarean-related infection quantify potential cost saving attributable use chlorhexidine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation cesarean section .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This randomize controlled clinical trial aim determine comparative effectiveness chlorhexidine-alcohol iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation prevent surgical site infection cesarean section . The investigator use broad inclusion criterion analyze main outcome intent-to-treat principle . This approach allow conservative estimate difference group allow good estimate effectiveness public health implication practice change rather pure estimate efficacy alone . Randomization Treatment : Enrolled patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio use computer-generated randomization sequence two skin preparation method . Blinding : Blinding patient physicians antiseptic use skin preparation ( double-blinding ) would ideal . However , feasible trial . First , patient determine whether assigned chlorhexidine iodine , two antiseptic different color leave stain skin ( pink brown , respectively ) . Second , physician often operate room skin prepared cesarean section know antiseptic use . We minimize systematic bias use standard procedure skin preparation , skin culture assessment outcome . All diagnose surgical site infection verify chart review use Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System criterion . The principal investigator verify diagnose without knowledge group patient assign . PRIMARY AIM : Outcome measures-Primary outcome-Proportion subject surgical site infection ( superficial incisional [ skin , subcutaneous layer ] deep incisional [ fascia , muscle ] ) within 30 day cesarean delivery . Surgical site infection base diagnosis treat physician verified chart review accordance CDC Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System definition . Secondary outcomes-Length hospital stay , number office visit re-admissions infection-related complication , endometritis , positive culture wound culture , skin irritation allergic reaction . Methods-Subjects undergo cesarean delivery base technique select surgeon . The circulate nurse record information key variable know related surgical site infection : antibiotic administration ( type timing ) , type cesarean section ( schedule emergent ) , status membrane ( rupture unruptured ) , duration surgery , depth subcutaneous layer ( close close ) skin closure method ( subcuticular suture staple ) data collection form . Demographic ( age , race , socioeconomic status ) , obstetric ( parity , gestational age , indication cesarean section , cervical dilation time cesarean section , presence chorioamnionitis , surgical complication ) neonatal ( birth weight , Apgar score , cord pH ) data abstract patient chart . Subjects contact , 30 day delivery , ass symptom cesarean-related infection . Patients report symptom direct follow emergency department physician evaluate surgical site infection . Wound swab take aerobic anaerobic culture subject present Barnes-Jewish Hospital wound infection . Medical record obtain treat physician determine diagnosis postoperative office visit readmission within 30 day cesarean section . Statistical Analysis : Data analysis base intent-to-treat principle . The primary outcome ( proportion subject surgical site infection ) categorical variable compare across group use chi-squared test . Fisher 's exact test use variable expect number cell 2 x 2 table &lt; 5 . We calculate 95 % confidence interval around difference proportion relative risk surgical site infection . Distribution continuous variable evaluate visual inspection histogram Kolmogorov-smirnov test . Normally distributed variable compare use unpaired t-tests . If variable normally distribute , log transformation use attempt achieve normal distribution . If data still skew log transformation Mann-Whitney U test use compare group . It anticipate baseline characteristic similar two group . In event group unbalance regard variable significantly associate primary outcome , supplemental analysis perform use stratification individual variable multivariable logistic regression adjust multiple covariates . Planned subgroup analysis perform : i. schedule elective cesarean section , iii . obese normal weight woman , iii . Subcuticular staple closure , iv . woman without chronic medical condition ( diabetes , chronic hypertension , renal disease ) . Interaction test use determine effectiveness skin preparation method differ across subgroup . Tests p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Analyses perform use Stata version 10.0 ( Stata Corp. , College Station , TX ) . Sample Size Estimation : The sample size estimation primary aim base assumed baseline surgical site infection rate 8 % anticipate clinically significant 50 % reduction surgical site infection . To 80 % power detect 50 % difference two-tailed chi-squared test α 0.05 , total 1084 subject need randomize . To accommodate 10 % drop rate , 1 , 192 subject enrol ( 596 chlorhexidine , 596 iodine ) . SECONDARY AIM # 1 : To test hypothesis preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation cesarean section significantly reduce bacterial contamination surgical site compare povidone-iodine Primary outcome-Proportion subject surgical site skin contamination antiseptic preparation . Contamination define ≥5000 total colony-forming unit per milliliter aerobic anaerobic culture . Secondary outcomes-Types bacteria culture skin preparation , concordance bacteria surgical site follow preoperative skin preparation bacteria postoperative surgical site infection . Methods-Two skin swab take transversely across suprapubic area , 2 finger breadth symphysis pubis immediately , 5 minute skin preparation . These swab culture aerobic anaerobic condition . To ensure group high risk surgical site infection well represent , ensure obese woman , diabetic woman undergo emergent cesarean delivery adequately sample randomize . Statistical Analysis-Data analysis base intent-to-treat principle . The primary outcome ( proportion subject surgical site skin contamination skin preparation ) categorical variable compare across group use chi-squared test . Fisher 's exact test use variable expect number cell 2 x 2 table &lt; 5 . Tests p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . We also conduct stratify analysis base different risk group . Finally , calculate 95 % confidence interval around difference proportion relative risk skin contamination antiseptic skin preparation . Analyses perform use Stata version 11.0 ( Stata Corp. , College Station , TX ) . Sample Size Estimation-The sample size estimation secondary aim # 1 base primary outcome skin contamination follow skin preparation . A meta-analysis data non-obstetric surgical procedure suggest contamination rate 39 % preoperative skin preparation iodine rate 18 % use chlorhexidine [ 17 ] . On basis assume contamination rate 39 % iodine group 50 % difference skin contamination clinically significant , total 168 subject need ( 84 chlorhexidine , 84 iodine ) 80 % power two-tailed chi-squared test α 0.05 . SECONDARY AIM # 2 The outcome secondary aim # 2 attributable cost saving ( ) , define difference total cost woman preoperative iodine chlorhexidine skin preparation . Methods/Data Analysis-A cost-benefit decision analysis model develop depict decision whether use chlorhexidine iodine patient undergo cesarean section . The cost implementing strategy include purchase cost antiseptic agent . For antisepsis strategy , patient would probability subsequently develop surgical site infection base result randomize trial primary aim . We calculate cost incurred patient develop infection . Costs obtain Barnes-Jewish Hospital cost accounting database surgical admission readmission hospital office visit within 30 day cesarean section . Cost saving , , difference cost two group . The cost-benefit analysis perform use TreeAge Pro 2009 ( TreeAge Software ) . Sample Size Estimation-No formal sample size estimation make secondary aim # 2 . The cost-benefit analysis base outcomes among subject enrol secondary aim # 2 .</detailed_description>
