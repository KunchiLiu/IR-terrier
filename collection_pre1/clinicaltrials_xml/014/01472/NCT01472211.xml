	<brief_summary>The overall aim trial determine whether use household-based water treatment device Life Straw Family ( LSF ) effective strategy improve zinc status health status vulnerable population develop country rural setting poor access potable water . To assess effectiveness LSF strategy ( filter deliver purified zinc enrich water ) double blind control field efficacy trial take place period 12 month rural village district Natitingou , North-West Benin . In order attain research objective efficacy trial envisage 3 arm : intervention ( zinc enrich filter ) , placebo ( filter ) control group ( disinfection table ) . During trial follow outcome monitor : zinc status growth rate participate child , zinc status pregnancy outcome sub-sample pregnant woman ( pregnancy sub-study ) , diarrhea prevalence participate subject , water quality , zinc enrichment water , modality consistency use LSF-device study population . The study hypotheses : 1 ) use LSF-device reduce microbiological contamination household water , 2 ) use LSF-device increase zinc intake serum zinc concentration preschool child , 3 ) use LSF-device increase zinc intake serum zinc concentration pregnant woman , 4 ) achievement 1 2 improve growth lower frequency length diarrhea episodes participate preschool child , 5 ) achievement 1 3 improve pregnancy outcome lower frequency length diarrhea episodes participate pregnant woman , 6 ) use LSF-device low frequency length diarrhea episodes participate household member .</brief_summary>
