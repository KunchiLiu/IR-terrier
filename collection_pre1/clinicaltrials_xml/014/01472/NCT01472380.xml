	<detailed_description>Efavirenz predominantly metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2B6 . Fenofibric Acid inhibitor CYP2B6 . This study evaluate effect multiple dos fenofibric acid steady-state pharmacokinetics single-dose efavirenz healthy adult subject . This study evaluate effect efavirenz fenofibric acid pharmacokinetics . On study Day 1 fast least 10 hour , thirty healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give one oral dose efavirenz ( 1 x 600 mg tablet ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics efavirenz . Blood sample continue non-confined basis 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour post-dose . A 21 day washout period complete first dose efavirenz Day 1 . On Days 22 30 , subject receive single oral dose fenofibric acid ( 1 x 105 mg tablet ) morning without regard meal . On morning Day 31 fast least 10 hour , study participant receive co-administered single oral dos efavirenz ( 1 x 600 mg tablet ) fenofibric acid ( 1 x 105 mg tablet ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics efavirenz . Blood sample continue non-confined basis 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour post-dose . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Vital sign ( seat blood pressure pulse ) measure prior dose approximately 1 , 2 , 3 5 hour post-dose Days 1 , 22 31 coincide peak plasma concentration efavirenz fenofibric acid . Blood pressure pulse also obtain 24 hour post-dose Days 2 32 prior discharge clinical study unit . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
