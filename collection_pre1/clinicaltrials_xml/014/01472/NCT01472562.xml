	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Plus Rituxan Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction Phase ( week 1 - 48 ) : - Lenalidomide give 20 mg/day day 1-21 28-day cycle 12 cycle . If excess toxicity observe dose increased 25 mg/day . - Rituximab administer 375 mg/m2 per dose total 9 dos . The first 4 dos administer weekly start day 1 lenalidomide ( e.g . day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ) . Subsequent rituximab dos administer one dose week 12 , 20 , 28 , 36 44 . Maintenance Phase ( week 49 - progression disease ) : - Lenalidomide give 15 mg/day day 1-21 28-day cycle . - Rituximab 375 mg/m2 per dose administer one dose every 8 week , start week 52 . Response Assessment - Year 1-2 : Conventional restaging CT scan ( MRI ) IV contrast every 3 month cycle 1 day 1 study . - Year 3 onwards : Conventional restaging CT scan ( MRI ) IV contrast every 6 month progression .</detailed_description>
