	<brief_summary>The investigator find community acquire C. diff occur child undergo colonoscopy . When treated symptom get well . But , investigator know treatment C. diff make well another factor make feel well . So , investigator design follow study . Children undergoing colonoscopy find C. diff positive time colonoscopy randomize one group get immediate treatment second group get delay treatment . Both group closely monitor symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Clostridium Difficile Children Undergoing Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile ( CD ) gram positive , spore form anaerobic bacillus normal commensal gastrointestinal tract . It initially name `` difficult clostridium '' difficult isolate grow culture medium . CD exist spore vegetative form . Outside colon , survive spore form resistant heat , acid antibiotic . In colon , CD find vegetative , toxin-producing form susceptible antibiotic . CD widely distribute infection acquire fecal-oral route person person contact , although organism culture toilet , bedpan , floor , telephone , shoe hospital personnel item . CD often identified disease acquire medical facility , community-acquired CD ( CACD ) also describe . CD infection positively associate use antibiotic gastric acid suppress agent . CD infection describe patient inflammatory bowel disease significantly associate need hospitalization . Those hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease CD high mortality longer hospital stay patient inflammatory bowel disease CD infection . CD serious problem among adult . Less known CD child . Although CD first identify newborn , consider pathogen child less one year age . In old child CD cause spectrum disease similar see adult low rate less severity . The epidemiology CD child study extensively systematic manner . However , intestinal colonization occur 5 % child old 2 year age . Recently , investigator find colonic aspirate positive CD toxin child time colonoscopy CD suspect . Our retrospective chart review child undergo colonoscopy 9/1/2006 8/30/2008 identify 41 ( 17 % ) CD positive colonic aspirate . There difference CD positive negative patient except abdominal pain weight loss together occur significantly often CD positive group . Significantly CD positive patient ( p = 0.01 ) use H2RA within one month colonoscopy . Too patient chart contain information antibiotic use determine relationship exist CD . Of CD positive patient 5 lose follow , 36 treat except 1 patient resolution symptom . The investigator conclude CD infection , likely acquire community , common child undergo colonoscopy symptom use discriminate child positive CD . The investigator also culture patient care sit Women Children 's Hospital find CD contamination colonoscope , medical area , supply identify . Colonic aspirate obtain 73 % colonoscopy . This retrospective chart review several weakness . The important weakness study design allow u discriminate intestinal colonization occur 5 % child ( 15 ) old 2 year age infection . The study permit assessment whether treatment significant effect symptom child present control group . The investigator address weakness prospective study . d. Experimental Study Design : . Brief : Double blind crossover study control arm . ii . Detailed : Patients undergo colonoscopy screen time initial recruitment exclusion criterion . At time endoscopy stool aspirate culture ( routine ) collect . At time endoscopy patient subject second round exclusion criterion base visual finding . Patients CD ( + ) stool aspirate randomize one two treatment arm ( early , delay ) . In addition , third arm CD ( - ) age match control also follow . e. Sample Size . A power calculation perform Chang-Xing Ma PhD . base improvement symptom 1 point group pain scale perform . Recruiting 25 patient sample group assume 30 % drop rate , final group sample size 17 17 achieve 80.7 % power detect difference 1.0 two group mean estimate group standard deviations 1.0 1.0 significance level ( alpha ) 0.05000 use two-sided two-sample t-test . ii . Based data retrospective review investigator know large amount variability population expect 1-2 patient enrol per month . f. Variables Interest i. Subjective : nausea , bloating , ii . Objective : pain , stool frequency , stool consistency , vomit , weight loss , antibiotic use , use acid suppression iii . Biochemical : stool glutamate dehydrogenase , lactoferrin , CD culture , CD toxin g. Completion . Recruitment period : 18 month ii . Completion therapy recruitment : 1 month iii .

Exclusion Criteria ( time colonoscopy ) . Visual evidence pseudomembranes ii . Visible ulceration iii . Mucosal friability iv . Mayo score great 4 v. Fissures/fistulas g. Vulnerable Subjects- The impact chronic abdominal pain note high prevalence , strong health care use , considerable restriction daily life child Adolescents ( 16 , 17 ) . As result disease burden prudent study vulnerable population determine biological trigger present , present trigger monitor treat . To protect population investigation patient participate age 18 require parental consent participant assent . Patients older 18 year age require documented consent . Participation project voluntary permission participate may withdraw time without risk change accept standard care . All test procedure non-invasive , monetary reward completion study sufficient compensate time travel cost incur financial burden family , addition monies great encourage participation sake monetary gain . C. Methods Procedures . Recruitment enrollment method . Patients recruit Department Pediatrics , Digestive Disease Nutrition Center . The patient population interest necessitate recruitment patient outside normal scope practice ii . Enrollment voluntary . Eligible patient screen time clinic visit offer potential opportunity participate study pending result routine screening . iii . Patients fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion end initial screen self identify interested participation give opportunity participate study . b. Privacy Protection . See Section C part e f. c. Research Setting . Women Children 's Hospital Buffalo ally clinic d. Summary Research Design . See Section A part d. e. Randomization . Group assignment assign time colonoscopy ii . Group assignment place patient assign therapeutic intervention iii . Random group assignment list patient enrollment number generate Chang-Xang Ma , PhD f. HIPAA . The patient `` Informed Consent Form '' ( please see section 6 application ) accompany separate document incorporate Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) compliant word patients/parents/legal guardian authorize use disclosure Protected Health information investigator person need information purpose study . The Written Informed Consent explain data verification purpose , study personnel , regulatory authority , IRB may require direct access part hospital practice record relevant study , include patient ' medical history . g. Data Storage Confidentiality . All study data securely house Digestive Disease Nutrition Center locate 219 Bryant Street ii .

Statistical analysis perform professional statistician , Chang-Xang Ma , PhD , University Buffalo , Buffalo , NY . Comparisons treatment 1 treatment 2 group perform SAS statistical software use chi square , Fisher 's exact test , t-test multivariate analysis indicate . D. Risks Potential Benefits Participation Research . Subject Risk . The risk subject initial colonoscopy great standard risk . The potential risk attributable home stool collection include contamination food , spread fecal oral organism appropriate hand wash perform . b . Subject potential benefit . The potential benefit patient resolution abdominal pain symptom E. Informed Consent Process ( Consent/Permission/Assent ) . The principal investigator ensure patient 's parent/guardian give full adequate oral write information nature , purpose , possible risk benefit study . As patient great assent age , assent obtain child enrol study . Patients patient 's parent/guardian give opportunity ask question allow time consider information provide . The patient/guardian 's sign date informed consent well patient 's assent obtain conducting procedure test specifically study .</detailed_description>
