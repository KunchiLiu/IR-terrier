	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea common condition affect gender . It affect often males female menopause prevalence sleep apnea increase female compare premenopausal one nearly high male . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device best standard treatment disease . All patient adherent CPAP treatment new method need . At moment medication available sleep apnea . Progesterone hormone know respiratory stimulant . Menopause alter significantly woman 's hormonal balance , example progesterone level decrease . Progesterone investigate treatment sleep apnea mostly male small population result conflict . Progestins ( like medroxyprogesterone acetate , MPA ) female hormone act progesterone receptor , would likely woman less side effect MPA therapy men . The purpose present study evaluate degree duration MPA effect well tolerability postmenopausal woman nasal CPAP treat sleep apnea compare effect nasal CPAP . The study placebo-controlled double-blind parallel group trial . We include 34 postmenopausal woman ( 17 placebo 17 MPA group ) treat sleep apnea CPAP 1 8 year . The trial include measurement baseline CPAP , 14 day placebo MPA ( 60 mg daily ) three-week washout . The patient discontinue CPAP one week baseline measurement , go medication . The patient allow continue additional two cycle MPA treatment continue normal CPAP treatment want . Those continued additional MPA cycle measurement visit 3 . The measurement include questionnaire symptom possible adverse event MPA , Visual analog scale ( VAS ) questionnaire 14 item sleep quality , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) quality life questionnaire . Laboratory assay include blood hemoglobin concentration , hematocrit WBC count , serum creatinine , alanine aminotransferase , total cholesterol , triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein , estradiol , FSH thyroid-stimulating hormone serum MPA concentration . Overnight polygraphic sleep study include simultaneous recording electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , electro-oculogram ( EOG ) , chin electromyogram ( EMG ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Respiration monitor finger probe pulse oximeter ( Ohmeda Biox 3700 Pulse Oximeter , BOC Health Care , USA ) , side-stream capnograph ( Datex NormocapÂ® CO2 &amp; O2 Monitor , Instrumentarium , Finland ) static-charge-sensitive bed ( SCSB ) . During first visit 's CPAP study , Autoset use treatment mode . In morning sleep study , subject complete questionnaire inquire subjective sleep quality study night .</detailed_description>
