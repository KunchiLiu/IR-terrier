	<detailed_description>Brain tumor account 2 % cancer result disproportionate share cancer morbidity mortality . The five-year survival rate common histologic subtypes , anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma ( glioblastoma multiforme , GBM ) , 30 % 10 % , respectively . After surgery , standard treatment malignant glioma focus cell death induction DNA damage , neglect fact invasion surround brain tissue fundamental feature major reason treatment failure . Drugs affect transform growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) might great interest malignant glioma treatment . The reason fact TGF-β act tumor suppressor normal epithelial cell early-stage tumor transform oncogenic factor advance tumor induces proliferation , angiogenesis , invasion , metastasis well suppress antitumoral immune response . In addition TGF-β expression TGF-β receptor , TβRI TβRII , overexpressed GBMs . TGF-β signal involved multiple step GBM development ( Golestaneh , Mishra , 2005 ) invasion ( Wesolowska et al , 2008 ) . Plasma TGF-β level elevate GBM patient decrease surgical tumor resection ( Schneider et al , 2006 ) . Progression-free survival overall survival worse malignant glioma patient high TGF-β signaling compare glioma patient low TGF-β signaling activity ( Bruna et al , 2007 ) . All feature make TGF-β promising target molecule biological treatment approach GBM ( Wick et al , 2006 ) . Phase I/II-studies TGF-β2-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide AP12009 malignant glioma show promising result ( Hau et al , 2007 ) . Another approach target TGF-β monoclonal antibody , GC1008 . GC1008 fully human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody capable neutralize mammalian isoforms TGF-β ( i.e. , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . For therapeutic success , may essential GC1008 reach target site , case locate brain . Our data 89Zr-bevacizumab , also IgG , show VEGF direct antibody bevacizumab penetrate brain localized brain metastasis . We therefore expect GC1008 reach malignant glioma well . In order initiate clinical trial TGF-β antibody patient would clearly great help prove drug arrives tumor site . 89Zr-GC1008 PET image allow u prove . In addition , PET image allows quantification amount GC1008 reach malignant glioma . A phase II study GC1008 patient relapse malignant glioma initiate currently , standard treatment available patient . Study objective : Part 1 : Feasibility 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging patient suspicion malignant glioma ass GC1008 penetrate brain tumor quantify uptake . Part 2 : 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging patient relapse malignant glioma phase II extension study therapeutic GC1008 patient . For part 1 , 12 patient include . For part 2 , 12-20 patient include .</detailed_description>
