	<detailed_description>Our previous trial ( know HALT , Healthy Active Lifestyle Trial ) suggest improvement aerobic fitness beneficial effect cognitive function rather specific . That , improvement aerobic fitness appear result improvement executive control process schedule , planning , coordination , inhibition , work memory - cognitive ability affect age . Indeed , executive control process prefrontal frontal region support show substantial disproportionate age-related decline . The main hypothesis investigator test present project deficit may particularly benefited improvement aerobic fitness combine cognitive training form dance . Additionally , compare outcome intervention aerobic condition ( walk ) group aerobic condition ( walk ) group also provide daily nutritional supplement ( walk + nutrition ) . The investigator examine relationship aerobic fitness , physical activity , cognitive status , brain function six-month aerobic training intervention study . The investigator collect psychosocial data functional fitness data ass relevant change psychological physical function bring exercise training . Healthy , non-active older adult ( 60 79 year age ) recruit local community . Half One quarter old adult randomly assign aerobic/cognitive combination group ( dance ) , one quarter remain half old adult randomly assign non-aerobic control group ( stretch , strengthen , stability ) , one quarter assign walk group , one quarter assign walk + nutrition group . The exercise intervention conduct trained exercise staff . The participant assess intervention ( 6 month ) . Assessments include ( ) cardiorespiratory testing , ( b ) physical activity monitoring ( c ) performance neurocognitive test executive non-executive function ( ) measure brain activation ( fMRI ) cognitive task 3.0 tesla MRI system ( e ) battery psychosocial questionnaire ( f ) functional performance measure ( g ) mock street walk task .</detailed_description>
