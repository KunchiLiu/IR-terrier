	<brief_summary>Use long-term central venous access device ( include tunnel line port ) associate development bloodstream infection cause build-up bacteria fungus inside device , call central line associate bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) . This infection generally require hospital admission antibiotic therapy . This treatment usually help eradicate infection sometimes possible clear come back treatment . Also , someone one line infection chance get another one high . This study test whether treatment secondary prophylaxis CLABSI ethanol lock therapy ( ELT ) significantly reduce risk treatment failure ( comprising failure clear initial infection , relapse reinfection ) child adolescent treat cancer hematologic disorder undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . ELT involve inject solution ethanol water line port , allow dwell 2 hour , withdraw solution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ethanol Lock Therapy Treatment Secondary Prophylaxis Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient CLABSI enrol within 96 hour collection positive blood culture randomize blind treatment 70 % ethanol heparin-saline placebo catheter lock therapy . After enrollment , subject receive catheter lock therapy 5 day Treatment Phase , follow 24 week Prophylaxis Phase . Participants active treatment arm receive 70 % ethanol lock placebo arm receive heparin-saline placebo lock identical fashion . In addition study intervention , participant arm receive standard systemic antibiotic therapy accord preference ward clinician . The intervention continue 24 week unless off-therapy criterion meet catheter remove . After intervention discontinue , participant monitor 90 day , 30 day line removal , whichever short . If intervention discontinue prior 24 week due adverse event physician request , participant monitor remainder 24 week period . Primary Objective : - To compare proportion therapeutic failure child adolescent CLABSI treatment standard care plus Ethanol Lock Therapy ( ELT ) versus standard care alone . Secondary Objectives : - To estimate compare cumulative incidence CLABSI treatment failure , relapse reinfection child adolescent receive ELT plus standard care versus receive standard care alone . - To estimate risk central venous access device ( CVAD ) occlusion associate use ELT plus standard care , compare standard care alone , child adolescent . - To estimate risk adverse event possibly attributable ELT associate use ELT plus standard care , compare standard care alone , child adolescent .</detailed_description>
