There need innovative , long-term economically-feasible intervention chronic stroke . Recently , focus place use virtual reality interactive gaming low cost effective manner treat movement disorder . Yet study investigate interactive gaming platform effect balance follow stroke . The propose study randomize , single-blind , control group cross-over study individual chronic stroke design examine innovative therapeutic approach investigate effect commercially-available game system balance , mobility fear fall sample individual chronic motor deficit follow stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine play active video game result improve balance motor performance . Design : Randomized-matched , single-blind , control group cross-over study Setting : Laboratory Patients : Participants chronic hemiparesis post-stroke randomly assign game group normal activity control group . Interventions : Gaming system provide interactive interface real-time movement either avatar screen . Participants play game 1 hour/day , 4 days/week , 5 week , total 20 hour game-play . The intervention strictly game-play without physical therapy . All game play stand position trainer supervise protect loss balance . Measurements : Both group test prior follow 5 week ( post-test ) 3 month follow completion intervention/control . Outcome measure include : Fugl-Meyer Motor Exam , Single Leg Stance time , symmetrical weight bearing , Berg Balance Scale , Dynamic Gait Index , Timed Up Go , Six Minute Walk , 3 Meter Walk , step length differential , perception recovery .</detailed_description>
