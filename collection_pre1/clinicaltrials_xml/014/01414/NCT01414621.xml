	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether angiogenesis decrease diabetic patient coronary artery disease compare non-diabetics coronary artery disease . The protein expression angiogenic factor examine atrial tissue prior initiation cardiopulmonary bypass patient undergoing coronary bypass surgery . The goal project evaluate tissue level HIF-1 , VEGF angiostatin diabetic non-diabetic patient come on-pump coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease complication lead cause death western world . Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) one major risk factor develop coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction post-infarction complication1-3 . Furthermore , mortality myocardial infarction almost double diabetic patient compare non-diabetics4 . Despite significant amount research , basis difference outcome still remain unclear . The survival myocardial tissue subject ischemia increase ability promote growth new blood vessel ischemic area , thus limit region impairment ultimately preserve myocardial function . Hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) -1 transcription factor promote expression several gene confer protection hypoxia/ischemia angiogenesis , erythropoiesis , vasodilation , alter glucose metabolism5,6 . Our hypothesis angiogenesis may impair diabetes mainly via decrease protein expression activation HIF-1 main downstream target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , well inhibitor angiogenesis factor , angiostatin7 , heart . Therefore purpose study examine whether angiogenic process coronary ischemia influence diabetes . To address question , HIF-1 , VEGF angiostatin protein expression evaluate atrial tissue obtain patient without diabetes undergo coronary bypass surgery . In addition comparison emergency elective procedure perform regard HIF-1 VEGF protein level correlation chronic statin therapy perform . During cannulation process , prior initiation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) heart surgery , small piece right atrium cut order insert venous cannula chamber . The investigator intend use piece tissue ( routinely waste ) protein histological analysis .</detailed_description>
