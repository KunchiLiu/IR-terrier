	<brief_summary>Three different white adipose tissue-related disorder , whether due excess ( obesity ) , absence ( lipoatrophies ) aberrant distribution ( lipodystrophies ) , paradoxically able induce metabolic insulin resistance syndrome . The respective role play quantitative qualitative anomaly adipose tissue , gluco- lipo-toxicity , liver muscle insulin resistance , low-grade fat inflammation immune alteration yet perfectly understood .

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Due ability store fatty acid secrete numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine , adipocytes appear key cell regulation energy metabolism immune response . Moreover , recently show adipocytes play role recruitment cell involve innate adaptive immunity adipose tissue . White adipose tissue-related disease numerous , whether excess ( obesity ) , complete ( lipoatrophies ) partial absence ( lipodystrophies ) ; 3 different disorder paradoxically able induce metabolic insulin resistance syndrome . Among involved cytokine , interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) , mostly know immune function , also participate quantitative qualitative balance fat mass . Thus , IL-7 over-expression animal model induces lipodystrophic syndrome insulin resistance , whereas human preliminary study show LMNA-linked lipodystrophies associate increase blood IL-7 level . IL-7 also participate reactivation autoimmunity patient autoimmune type 1 islet transplantation . Otherwise , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor immunosuppressive , metabolic anti-tumoral property different signal pathway . Rapamycin ( sirolimus ) ( Rapamune® ) , mTOR inhibitor use islet transplantation , much great ability inhibit adipocyte differentiation modulate ß cell function accord energetic status . In contrast organ transplantation , diabetes cell therapy associate body weight loss , possibly relate antiadipogenic effect mTOR inhibitor ; specific role play prognostic factor islet transplantation remains determine . Conversely , organ transplantation usually associate weight gain , involve genesis post-transplantation diabetes , AKA new-onset diabetes transplantation ( NODAT ) , long-term vascular complication transplantation . Adipose tissue redistribution yet study patient transplantation . The aim study thus determine blood IL-7 cytokine level ; metabolic parameter ; fat mass distribution immunosuppressive regimen patient receive different kind transplantation ( liver , kidney islet ) normal weight type 2 diabetes transplantation . In patient , blood sample take transplantation , adipose tissue transplantation surgery , order constitute plasma , serum , gene tissue bank determine mechanism link fat mass , insulin resistance immunity , ex vivo vitro . Patients : The included patient normal-weight subject enlist liver , kidney islet transplantation , type 2 diabetes ( liver kidney transplantation ) . Methods : Blood IL-7 level , immune and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine , lymphocyte immunophenotype , metabolic parameter , fat mass non-invasive method ( DEXA RMN ) assess one-year transplantation . Blood , transplantation , well adipose tissue transplantation surgery , sample order constitute blood , gene tissue bank define inflammatory status tissue use histological molecular analysis . Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint IL-7 blood level different group accord fat mass , metabolic parameter immunosuppressive regimen . The hypothesis increase IL-7 level , possibly induce immunosuppressive regimen , associate quantitative and/or qualitative disturbance adipose tissue development insulin resistance . Expected result possible implication : This study enable consequence immunosuppression IL-7 level , adipose tissue disturbance glucose metabolism determine . Our approach combine clinical investigation ex vivo vitro analysis original result well understand cellular mechanism responsible inflammatory process initiate white adipose tissue accompany disorder tissue ( especially post-transplantation diabetes ) , thus open new therapeutic perspective major complication transplantation .</detailed_description>
