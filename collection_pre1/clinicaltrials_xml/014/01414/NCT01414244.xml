	<detailed_description>Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) common gastrointestinal disorder estimate affect 20 % US population . IBS patient significantly decrease quality life utilize large amount health care resource . IBS patient suffer chronic abdominal pain associate diarrhea , constipation , and/or bloating . Several mechanism may lead IBS propose include : alteration receptor neuropeptides , bacterial overgrowth alter microbiota , alter intestinal transit , anxiety depressive symptom , increase intestinal membrane permeability . Several recent study show diarrhea-predominant IBS ( D-IBS ) patient increase intestinal permeability may lead chronic gastrointestinal symptom . Our laboratory recently evaluate diarrhea-predominant IBS patient report increased membrane permeability . The investigator obtain preliminary evidence oral glutamine supplementation restore membrane permeability improve chronic gastrointestinal symptom IBS patient . Previously , well establish deficiency glutamine may lead increase membrane permeability supplementation glutamine restore intestinal membrane permeability . There publish study date support use glutamine Irritable Bowel Syndrome . However , give preliminary data mechanism action glutamine gastrointestinal tract , research test whether oral glutamine effective therapy Irritable Bowel Syndrome definitely need . Based new finding , investigator hypothesize oral glutamine supplementation improve IBS Symptom Severity Scale restore intestinal membrane permeability diarrhea-predominant IBS patient . The investigator propose conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial study glutamine 10 g po tid compare placebo 10 g po tid 8 week 100 diarrhea-predominant IBS patient . The IBS Symptom Severity Scale intestinal membrane permeability measure baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week . The result study lead follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To determine oral glutamine supplementation improve IBS Symptom Severity Scale IBS patient . To accomplish aim , investigator measure change IBS Symptom Severity Scale follow treatment either oral glutamine supplementation placebo . The primary outcome measure improvement ≥50 baseline score IBS Symptom Severity Scale . This constitute clinically significant response treatment . Hypothesis 1 . IBS patient improvement ≥50 IBS Symptom Severity Scale follow oral glutamine supplementation compare placebo . Specific Aim 2 : To determine oral glutamine supplementation restore intestinal membrane permeability IBS patient . To accomplish aim , investigator measure change intestinal membrane permeability follow treatment either oral glutamine supplementation placebo . Hypothesis 2a . Oral glutamine supplementation restore intestinal membrane permeability IBS patient compare placebo . Hypothesis 2b . Improvement IBS Symptom Severity Scale correlate restoration intestinal membrane permeability follow oral glutamine compare placebo . Layman Statement : Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) common gastrointestinal disorder characterize chronic abdominal pain associate alteration bowel habit diarrhea and/or constipation . IBS patient diarrhea show `` leaky gut '' bacteria toxin may penetrate gut wall , term increase membrane permeability . The current proposal investigate oral glutamine supplementation treatment symptom `` leaky gut '' diarrhea-predominant IBS patient .</detailed_description>
