	<brief_summary>The investigator propose assess safety efficacy new administration method deliver biologic child form Batten disease use experimental gene transfer procedure . This gene transfer procedure consist deliver good copy mutate gene nerve cell via virus . These child bear genetic change call mutation result inability brain properly recycle protein . The recycling failure lead death nerve cell brain progressive loss brain function . Children Batten disease normal birth age 2 4 motor vision problem progress rapidly death age approximately 10 year old . There therapies available treat disease . The investigator previous clinical trial use virus call adeno-associated virus 2 ( AAV2 ) gene delivery system . That study show viral delivery gene safe show small , significant benefit recipient . The investigator currently IRB approve protocol us slightly different virus call AAVrh.10 gene delivery system . This 3rd protocol proposes use virus AAVrh.10 gene delivery system expand eligibility criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AAVRh.10 Administered Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design run parallel currently IRB approve protocol # 0810010013 entitle `` Direct CNS Administration Replication Deficient Adeno-associated Virus Gene Transfer Vector Serotype rh.10 Expressing Human CLN2 cDNA Children Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis , '' ass safety efficacy virus AAVrh.10 deliver CLN2 gene child early stage disease . This current study propose assess safety efficacy administration biologic child fit criterion IRB protocol # 0810010013 . The difference protocol # 0810010013 propose `` parallel '' protocol inclusion criterion modify include child genotype ( 5 common genotype currently approve protocol ) and/or score 6 least 1 Weill Cornell LINCL scale . The reason expand eligibility criterion obtain range safety data child LINCL , limit genotype and/or severity . Only 8 subject administer gene transfer vector `` parallel '' protocol . Subjects accrue IRB approve protocol # 0901010186 entitle , `` Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis ( 2 ) . '' Those fit criterion already approve gene transfer protocol ( # 0810010013 ) may opportunity enrol propose `` parallel protocol '' ( Figure 1 ) . The subject new protocol compare 16 treat 16 untreated child enrol IRB protocol # 0810010013 # 0901010186 , respectively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion . 1 . Definitive diagnosis LINCL , base clinical phenotype genotype . The study limit one specific genotype ( genetic constitution ) . 2 . The subject must age 3 18 year . 3 . Subjects average total score le 4 least 1 , and/or uncommon genotype define genotype include least one 5 common mutant CLN2 genotype : C3670T ( nonsense Arg208 stop ) , G3556C ( intron 7 splice ) , G5271C ( Gln422His ) , T4396G ( aberrant splicing , intron8 ) , G4655A . The total LINCL score outside 95th percentile confidence limit age base historic data . 4 . The subject previously participate gene transfer stem cell study . 5 . Parents study participant must agree comply good faith condition study , include attend required baseline followup assessment , parent legal guardian must give consent child 's participation . 6 . Sexually active subject use contraception treatment 2 month completion treatment . Exclusion criterion . 1 . Presence significant medical neurological condition may disqualify subject participation study , particularly would create unacceptable operative risk risk receive AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 vector , e.g. , malignancy , congenital heart disease , liver renal failure . 2 . Subjects without adequate control seizures . 3 . Subjects heart disease would risk anesthesia history major risk factor hemorrhage . 4 . Subjects participate MRI study . 5 . Concurrent participation FDA approve Investigational New Drug . 6 . Subjects history prolong bleed abnormal platelet function take aspirin . 7 . Renal disease alter renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl admission . 8 . Abnormal serum sodium , potassium calcium , magnesium , phosphate grade III IV Division AIDS Toxicity Scale 9 . Hepatic disease alter liver function define SGPT &gt; 150 U/L , T.Bilirubin &gt; 1.3 mg/dL 10 . Immunosuppression define WBC &lt; 3,000 admission 11 . Uncorrected coagulopathy baseline period define INR &gt; 1.4 ; PTT &gt; 35 sec ; PLT &lt; 150,000/mm3 12 . Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 mg/dl &gt; 2 year age , normal serum iron study )</criteria>
