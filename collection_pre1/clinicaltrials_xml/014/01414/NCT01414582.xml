	<brief_summary>This study aim test whether repeated session tDCS result long-lasting improvement motor function patient chronic stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Stimulation Motor Training Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research utilise single session tDCS demonstrate functional improvement ; however , improvement usually short-lived , last less one hour patient 's performance return baseline . It suggest repeated stimulation session require elicit long-lasting improvement . We aim consider detail duration research , patient chronic stroke attend 16 session course 3 month . This research important implication ; previous study suggest approach potential facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke establish tDCS clinically viable rehabilitative tool . Recovery motor skill may take many month acquire therefore strategy potential enhance acquisition skill practical scientific interest .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male Female , age 18 80 year . Patients least six month post first symptomatic stroke affect motor function hand . Anyone adequate understanding verbal write information English , sufficient complete safety screen form . Anyone previous history epilepsy , febrile convulsion child recurrent fainting fit . Likewise , anyone significant family history epilepsy would exclude condition carry theoretical risk increase susceptibility seizure . Any person history drug abuse previous history neurological psychiatric illness , history neurosurgical procedure exclude may increase risk epilepsy data collect may influence condition . Patients prescription medication antidepressant may exclude may increase risk seizure . Anyone currently take take antimalarial treatment last 72 hour . Pregnant woman exclude precaution data effect maternal cranial stimulation fetus . Any metallic implant neck , head , eye anyone implanted electrical device would exclude risk heat TMS TDCS stimulation . Anyone metal implant implantable device would exclude indicated MRI safety screen form . People suffer claustrophobia unable tolerate scanner . Patients one stroke . Patients stroke also exclude limited communication form aphasia history dementia .</criteria>
