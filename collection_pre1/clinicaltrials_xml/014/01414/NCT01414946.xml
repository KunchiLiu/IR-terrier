	<brief_summary>Loss muscle protein mass main cause fatigue bowel surgery may result long hospital stay high rate complication . This problem especially important patient surgery bowel cancer cancer cause waste muscle protein . Anesthesiologists decrease negative effect surgery choose type pain treatment ( analgesia ) give nutrition ( sugar protein ) . Our group recently observe optimal pain relief epidural catheter ( place call epidural space , lie spine skin back ) combination low calorie protein diet intravenously ( vein ) maintain body 's protein store bowel surgery . The goal new research program find whether protein save effect depend protein depleted patient surgery . In word would like answer question : cancer patient show protein waste operation benefit feed patient show sign protein waste ? A second goal program find need use sugar part diet whether infusion protein alone sufficient . Just give protein would make feed easy also would avoid increase patient 's blood sugar operation , typically occur sugar give intravenously period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Intravenous Nutrition Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Goals The overall goal perioperative nutrition support abolish protein waste promote anabolic process direct amino acid protein synthesis rather oxidation . Protein repletion enhancement anabolism appear particularly important cancer patient enter major abdominal surgery catabolic state . 2 . Objectives The objective research program - examine whether anabolic effect hypocaloric nutrition depend degree catabolism operation thus identify patient benefit perioperative nutrition support ( study I ) - investigate whether exclude glucose hypocaloric nutrition , i.e . infuse isonitrogenous amount amino acid without glucose avoids hyperglycemia , thus , accentuate patient 's anabolic response feeding ( study II ) . In order confirm validity assumption perform two consecutive study two distinct patient population . For assessment patient ' catabolic state obtain insight biochemical mechanism , whereby effect nutrition mediate , stable isotope tracer kinetics apply . Using prim continuous infusion L- [ 1-13C ] leucine [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose quantitate whole body dynamic protein glucose metabolism , i.e . protein breakdown , amino acid oxidation , protein synthesis , glucose production glucose uptake surgery . A positive protein balance ( difference protein synthesis protein breakdown ) use indicator anabolism . Anabolic process organ level ( liver , muscle ) , i.e . fractional synthesis rate acute phase protein albumin fibrinogen muscle protein synthesis determine use L- [ 2H5 ] phenylalanine infusion . Skeletal muscle protein catabolism characterize measure mRNA expression ubiquitin two key ligases muscle ( MAFbx/atrogen-1 MuRF-1 ) .</detailed_description>
