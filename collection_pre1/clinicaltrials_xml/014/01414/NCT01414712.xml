	<detailed_description>SBRT ( stereotactic body radiotherapy ) may decrease actually increase CTC level patient cancer , knowledge effect different therapy , include SBRT , CTC level general interest oncology community . Patients undergo blood draw define time indicated . 1 . Prior CT-simulation , 2 day digital rectal examination 2 . Within 24 hour follow CT simulation ( endorectal balloon use time simulation ) 3 . Within 24 hour follow first treatment 4 . Within 24 hour follow third treatment 5 . Within 1 week follow fifth treatment</detailed_description>
