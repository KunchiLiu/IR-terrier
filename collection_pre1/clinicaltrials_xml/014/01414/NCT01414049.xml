	<brief_summary>Heart bypass surgery use increase blood flow heart . This surgery usually do use heart-lung machine ( on-pump surgery ) allow surgeon perform procedure still heart . However , heart-lung machine cause inflammatory response link complication heart injury , stroke , brain injury , kidney failure , need blood transfusion , irregular heart rhythms death . An effective way counteract effect heart-lung machine use pump , thus perform bypass surgery beat heart ( off-pump surgery ) . However , off-pump surgery technically difficult , possibly associate decrease graft patency . The ongoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Off On Pump Revascularization Study ( CORONARY ) , prospective randomize clinical trial compare bypass surgery do without pump . Worldwide , 4700 patient include followed 5 year . The propose research project , The Patency AssessmenT graft pErformed iN CORONARY ( PATENCY-CORONARY ) , prospective clinical trial evaluation patency ( `` openness '' ) bypass graft enrol 1200 consecutive CORONARY patient reach one year follow-up . Patients undergo non-invasive scan use X-rays safely quickly evaluate graft patency . The PATENCY-CORONARY trial determine off-pump surgery associate decrease graft patency 1-year post-surgery compare on-pump surgery perform skilled surgeon different clinical setting , whether decrease graft patency associate adverse short long-term outcome , explore risk factor associate decreased graft patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : As Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) aim restore adequate blood supply ischemic heart , success operation depend mainly patency bypass graft . Graft failure consequence similar native coronary artery disease : recurrent angina , myocardial infarct ( MI ) , additional revascularization procedure , premature death . CABG generally perform use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) cardioplegic arrest allow surgeon complete delicate coronary anastomosis still heart bloodless field . Off-pump CABG surgery use specially design heart stabilizer system propose less invasive approach CABG avoid CPB circuit . The benefit off-pump CABG compare conventional on-pump CABG still intensively debate . Multislice spiral compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) represent non-invasive method compare conventional coronary angiography allow comprehensive objective image bypass graft native coronary elevate diagnostic accuracy . Rationale : CORONARY trial ( NCT00463294 ) large , international , prospective , CIHR-funded , randomize control trial assess short long-term clinical outcome 4,700 patient undergoing on-pump off-pump CABG . However , angiographic evaluation coronary graft patency intend CORONARY . Objectives : PATENCY-CORONARY new prospective trial consecutive subset 1,200 CORONARY patient reach one-year follow-up undergo graft patency assessment use CTA 3D reconstruction . This trial determine whether off-pump compare on-pump CABG surgery associate low CABG patency perform experienced surgeon association graft failure assess CTA , occurrence CORONARY primary outcome ( composite death , angina , MI , stroke , renal failure new coronary revascularization [ CABG PCI ] ) . Primary outcome : CABG patency index ( i.e . percentage patent [ non-occluded ] distal anastomose total number distal anastomose patient ) 1 year CABG surgery experience surgeon ; Secondary outcome : 1 ) graft lesion severity 3-point scale 1 year ( mimic FitzGibbon grade ABO ) ; 2 ) percentage patient least one occluded bypass graft 1 year ; Tertiary outcome : correlation CTA finding ( compromised graft ) CORONARY primary outcome ( composite death , angina , MI , stroke , renal failure new coronary revascularization [ CABG PCI ] ) , one five-year follow-up post-CABG . Methods : All CORONARY patient reach one-year follow-up include consecutively PATENCY-CORONARY trial target 1,200 CTA reach reason exclusion note prospectively prevent selection bias . Amount contrast agent use , radiation dose potential morbidity image procedure record . Each CTA examination assess two experience blinded radiologist graft classify accord conduit type portion : body graft , anastomose distal native coronary bed . In addition PATENCY-CORONARY outcome analysis , patient undergo CTA compare exclude patient ( CTA ) overall cohort patient .</detailed_description>
