	<brief_summary>The aim study prospectively evaluate frequency bacteremia ERCP/cholangioscopy use Spyglass Direct Visualization System . In addition , frequency cholangitis/sepsis despite use post procedural antibiotic study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Investigate Frequency Possible Bacterial Entry Into Bloodstream ( Bacteremia ) Infectious Complications Associated With Use Spyglass Cholangioscopy System During ERCP ( Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rates bacteremia ( bacterial seed blood ) follow ERCP 's range 6.4 % 18.0 % . However , infectious complication cholangitis/sepsis occur 0.5 % - 3.0 % patient undergoing procedure . The Spyglass Direct Visualization System allow cholangioscopy direct visualization bile duct ERCP use specialize small caliber endoscope . During Spyglass portion procedure , saline introduce bile duct irrigate biliary system , order distend biliary duct improve visualization clearing contrast , pus stone debris . Saline irrigation may increase intrabiliary pressure may therefore theoretically increase risk bacteremia infection . The effect Spyglass cholangioscopy biliary irrigation frequency bacteremia/post cholangioscopy infection unknown previously study . The aim study prospectively evaluate frequency bacteremia ERCP/cholangioscopy use Spyglass system .</detailed_description>
