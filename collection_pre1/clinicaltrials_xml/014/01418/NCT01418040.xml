	<brief_summary>This single centre prospective observational noninterventional study men histological confirm prostate cancer , high risk disease positive metastatic disease plan receive Radiotherapy 18 month Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) . Although ADT improve chance cure , also many side effect . One bone mineral density loss . When advanced , call osteoporosis . Men osteoporosis high chance get fracture bone hip spine . Currently , best way measure osteoporosis bone mineral density scan use DEXA scanner . The primary objective study see baseline Magnetic Resonance Imager ( MRI ) Computer Tomogram ( CT ) combine clinical factor predict men great risk accelerate ADT induce bone mineral density loss baseline DEXA scan alone . The data patient use construct model predict annual rate bone loss base baseline imaging , clinical biochemical characteristic . Secondary aim study follow : - Evaluating feasibility , toxicity ( acute late ) efficacy ( 5 year biochemical control Phoenix definition ) multimodality therapy hypofractionated radiotherapy ( give large dose radiotherapy shorter time 5½ week compare standard 8 week approach ) . Although used overseas , 5½ week regimen use widely Australia , would like see gain similar result report US . - Feasibility efficacy risk adapt duration neoadjuvant hormonal therapy . Usually , ADT give 19 month radiotherapy start agreement duration best . This trial aim tailor duration ADT prior radiotherapy base blood PSA test result . - Prognostic value circulate tumour cell ( CTCs ) . This blood test detect cancer cell blood use patient metastatic cancer . The presence CTCs men prostate cancer correlate poor overall survival . Potentially , high risk prostate cancer patient CTCs detect may represent high risk group could therefore warrant treatment intensification . - To correlate bone marrow change MRI change blood count patient report fatigue . Measuring bone marrow may help predict patient risk lose bone faster also become anaemic , suffer fatigue . A correlation may better explain toxicity associate ADT . - Implementation nomogram base radiotherapy target delineation algorithm .

	<detailed_description>1 . ADT induce Osteoporosis Prostate cancer common malignancy Australian men . In men localize disease time diagnosis , baseline PSA level , tumour stage Gleason grade use help stratify risk category . Men high risk disease define absence metastatic disease use conventional imaging , one following : present PSA &gt; 20 , Gleason grade 8-10 disease histology , stage T3-4 disease . [ 1 ] Such men often treat combination radiotherapy prostate pelvic lymph node , conjunction course adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) 18-36 month . [ 2 ] Recent literature suggest great benefit adjuvant ADT come first 4-6 month treatment , although measurable benefit prolong course ADT , follow law diminish return progressively small benefit per unit increase treatment time . [ 3 ] This important , cumulative toxicity inflict prolong treatment , likely duration harm treatment start outweigh shrink disease control benefit . With great clinical experience use adjuvant ADT , become good awareness toxicity associate treatment . Accelerated loss bone mineral density long recognize complication hypogonadal . There good evidence lead approximately 7 % high risk fracture men prostate cancer manage ADT . [ 4 ] Osteoporotic fracture associate increased morbidity mortality , high proportion patient suffer never fully regain pre-fracture level functioning . There Australian guideline management osteopaenia / osteoporosis men manage ADT . [ 5 , 6 ] They recommend monitor bone mineral density ( BMD ) use annual DEXA scanning , supplementary Vitamin D Calcium , use bisphosphonate therapy men prevalent minimal trauma fracture baseline BMD T-Score &lt; -2.0 . One point high-lighted wide spectrum rate bone mineral loss patient techniques measurement , figure high 8 % per year report . This far excess normal rate bone loss amongst males 0.5 % per year . [ 7 ] Although validated nomogram exist general population combine DEXA finding clinical parameter predict long term fracture risk , tool exists men render hypogonadal use ADT . [ 8 ] Guidelines men ADT empirical , largely copy risk factor general population . [ 9 ] Beyond baseline BMD , clinical factor show accuracy predict bone loss men ADT change serum P1NP ( N-Terminal Pro-peptide Type 1 Procollagen , marker bone formation ) . [ 10 ] One study show men high tertile P1NP 6 month ADT , great loss BMD 12 month . This finding verify , remain need investigate utility clinical parameter either baseline early ADT therapy find accurate predictor patient high risk accelerate BMD loss . Osteoporosis Imaging Currently , method reliably determine men rapid bone loser perform serial DEXA imaging . Thus , time rapid bone loss occur , late take measure prevent intervention curtail duration adjuvant ADT . Furthermore , level 2 evidence randomize clinical trial , intervention bisphosphonate need instigated commencement ADT continue throughout duration ADT maximize bone density . [ 10 ] This study aim define predictive tool combine baseline image clinical characteristic help determine patient high risk accelerate bone loss prior initiation ADT . Osteoporosis complex condition characterize loss cortical trabecular bone . [ 11 ] The structural basis bone loss poorly quantify DEXA scan combine cortical trabecular bone density measurement . [ 12 ] However , separately non-invasively quantified use ultrasound ( US ) , computerize tomography ( CT ) , peripheral high resolution quantitative CT ( pHR-QCT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . [ 13 ] The last method advantage operator dependent , require exposure ionize radiation wide availability . A disadvantage relatively poor characterization cortical trabecular bone field strength 1.5 T. There work use CT image separately quantify cortical trabecular BMD , well parameter trabecular bone quality . Much work use pHR-QCT , reveal detailed change porosity cortical bone men ADT likely weaken bone , term 'trabecularization ' . [ 14 ] Recent study compare technique relatively limited accessibility , widely available technology Quantitative CT ( QCT ) Multidetector CT ( MDCT ) . [ 15 , 16 ] A accurate correlation Trabecular BMD find 3 CT modality . This raise possibility BMD estimate stag MDCT perform prostate cancer patient , without need expose extra radiation dose require perform QCT . An advantage MRI also allow collection additional information regard bone marrow ( BM ) include fat fraction perfusion . These measure previously show correlation BMD measure DEXA imaging , however correlation relatively poor , wide degree unexplained variation . [ 17-19 ] BM intimate proximity trabecular bone , paracrine factor RANK-Ligand secrete BM play key role recruit bone resorb osteoclast . [ 20 ] It might therefore variation BMD measure DEXA due baseline variation BM quantity . There also possible correlation BM fat ( BMF ) , subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT ) , visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) hepatic adipose tissue ( HAT ) , separately quantified MRI . [ 21 ] This , turn , may link deranged insulin level response link ADT administration , posit cause increase cardiovascular morbidity . [ 22 ] Other evidence show ADT induce drop haemoglobin average baseline value 151 g/L 135 within 18 month start treatment . [ 23 ] No haemolytic process evident , circumstantial evidence point bone marrow suppression mechanism . Such mild anaemia may also contribute insidious fatigue often see men treat ADT . There also evidence reanalysis randomize trial data , men great drop haemoglobin 3 month follow initiation ADT poorer overall survival set metastatic disease . [ 24 ] As , measure BM baseline may help predict patient risk lose bone faster , become anaemic , suffer fatigue . It therefore plausible measurement BM add important dimension knowledge bone functional unit well well explain toxicity associate ADT . 2 . Circulating Tumour Cells For cancer metastasize primary site origin part body , malignant cell must series change . One crucial step involve able use blood vessel transport tumour cell around body . Assays commercially available measure Circulating Tumour Cells ( CTCs ) , include one FDA approval brand-name 'CellSearch ' . [ 25 , 26 ] This supercede old approach use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detect CTC men prostate cancer . [ 27 ] Work last decade patient metastatic cancer show presence CTCs men PC bad prognostic factor , high level CTCs correlate poor overall survival . [ 28 ] On side spectrum tumour burden , work look patient undergo radical prostatectomy show low incidence CTCs ( ~20 % ) prior surgery , different measure cohort healthy control . [ 29 ] One issue study &lt; 5 % patient involve would predict eventually suffer metastatic failure , hence chance find CTCs likely low base mainly low intermediate risk patient cohort examine . Men high risk PC much high chance eventual metastatic failure , order 20-30 % , high depend initial risk factor ( PSA level , tumour stage Gleason grade ) . At time diagnosis men may therefore exhibit CTC level intermediate metastatic surgical cohort previously consider . It may high risk PC patient CTCs detect represent high risk group , apart provide important prognostic information men , could therefore warrant treatment intensification increase duration adjuvant ADT , entry clinical trial . 3 . Prostate Radiotherapy Hypofractionation Radiotherapy ( RT ) show independently improve overall survival men high risk PC manage ADT . [ 30 ] As , standard care men remain bimodality treatment RT ADT . [ 1 ] RT traditionally give dose 1.8-2 Gy per day due concern potential large fraction size cause late toxicity . Over last 10 year multiple randomize control trial ( RCTs ) show high dos RT ( order 74-80 Gy ) lead good rate biochemical evidence disease ( bNED ) . [ 31 , 32 ] Due long natural history PC , bNED validate surrogate endpoint look PSA control , [ 33 ] however trial long follow-up also begin show improvement Prostate Cancer Specific Survival ( PCSS ) . [ 31 ] The use regimens lead treatment duration 8-10 week , inconvenient patient , consume large proportion capacity RT department , consequently significant factor existence wait list radiotherapy . There strong data PC suggest hypofractionation ( , daily fraction size &gt; 2 Gy ) particularly effective maximize tumour effect . Newer technology image guide RT ( IGRT ) ensure accurate delivery RT , intensity modulate RT ( IMRT ) reduce unwanted radiation dose adjacent normal structure clinical use Australia . They use phase 2 trial Hypofractionated RT ( HypoRT ) , result efficacy late toxicity comparable report literature conventionally fractionate cohort . [ 34 , 35 ] There two small RCTs recently report compare HypoRT conventionally fractionate population , show increased toxicity HypoRT , well bNED . [ 36 , 37 ] One focus mainly high-risk men include ADT , similar patient population eligible PROCITT . [ 36 ] 4 . Radiotherapy Volume When define RT treatment volume man PC , traditional thinking treat prostate alone . However , local treatment modality RT surgery , important appreciate natural pattern spread disease . For instance , good consensus guideline patient head neck cancer help radiation oncologist know likely benefit elective treatment cervical neck lymph node . This , despite neck negative time diagnosis , surgical neck dissection series help inform decision aid regard chance clinically normal neck harbour sub-clinical disease . Nomograms construct large surgical PC cohorts help define risk extracapsular extension , seminal vesicle involvement lymph node involvement base initial clinical parameter . Trying treat patient progressively large treatment volume require include area would potentially increase toxicity without high chance improve efficacy . However , threshold risk level 15-25 % require prior include elective target volume , would aim apply treatment patient likely benefit . Such concept already begin enter consensus guideline , [ 1 , 38 ] clearly represent promise avenue investigation . Of expanded treatment volume , Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy ( WPRT ) investigate men PC RCT . [ 39 ] Neither RCT find significant benefit use WPRT . However , many practice change RCTs use WPRT patient . [ 2 , 40-42 ] One reason discrepancy likely entry criterion large WPRT RCT estimate 15 % risk pelvic lymph node involvement . [ 39 ] Later work show correspond 2 % pathological risk nodal involvement . This emphasize need use validate decision tool select appropriate treatment . 5 . Duration neoadjuvant ADT Often adjuvant ADT give prior commence RT . This know neoadjuvant hormonal therapy ( NHT ) . There clear guidance duration give , although 3-6 month common approach . Results Australian randomize trial show 6 month NAT result superior survival 3 month . [ 43 ] Intuitively , would seem patient would benefit short duration NHT others depend tumour response . There preliminary work look adaptive approach , RT start maximal PSA response achieve . [ 44 ] This show feasible effective phase 2 setting .</detailed_description>
