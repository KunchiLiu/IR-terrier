	<brief_summary>This study compare two similar design knee replacement device . One device ( Sigma CR150 ) slightly modify version original ( Sigma CR ) modify enhance/accommodate high flexion . The original device widespread clinical use excellent result since 1996 study determine whether design modification new device add value . The new device clinical use good short-term ( unpublished ) outcome since become commercially available January 2009 . Achieving high knee flexion may require cultural reason increasingly young , active patient population undergo knee replacement today . In addition promote flexion , also possible design change may help knee replacement last longer traditional implant patient achieve high flexion . Therefore , study compare two device term survivorship , flexion measure success total knee replacement ( range motion , knee-related quality life , activity generic quality life ) short-term . A minimum one hundred forty subject ( minimum 70 per group ) osteoarthritis age 50-75 year include UK/international hospital . Study duration 2 year patient complete standard knee outcome score plus radiological evaluation . Subjects would receive one study device regardless involvement study , apart ( possible ) additional visit , x-rays and/or questionnaire , treatment follow-up care per care would receive outside study .</brief_summary>
