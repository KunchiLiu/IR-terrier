	<detailed_description>The worldwide Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) epidemic may control development utilization safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . Due high prevalence HIV-1 subtype C southern Africa , South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative ( SAAVI ) , HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) , Novartis , National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) evaluate three subtype C HIV vaccine , SAAVI DNA-C2 , SAAVI MVA-C , Novartis Subtype C gp140 study . These vaccine use together four prime-boost regimen . The SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine multigene deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) vaccine consist two DNA plasmid equal amount express HIV-1 subtype C polyprotein comprise Gag-Reverse Transcriptase-Tat-Nef HIV-1 subtype C truncate Env . SAAVI MVA-C recombinant modify vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) vaccine express immunogen SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine . MVA highly attenuate vaccinia virus . The Novartis protein subunit vaccine Subtype C oligomeric V2 loop delete glycoprotein 140 ( gp140 ) vaccine ( gp140 [ delta ] V2.TV1 ) , give MF59 adjuvant . This trial design build upon Thai RV144 HIV vaccine trial , demonstrate efficacy 31.2 % among participant receive different vaccine regimen pox prime follow concurrently-administered protein boost . This primary purpose HVTN 086 evaluate safety immunogenicity SAAVI DNA-C2 , SAAVI MVA-C Novartis Clade C gp140TV1ΔV2 MF59 adjuvant various vaccination regimen . The primary analysis focus rank strategy vaccine regimens guided measurement immune response elicit vaccine respective mode delivery various combination , sequential concurrent . Participants actively participate study 12 month . Participants randomly assign receive either prime-boost preventive vaccine regimen placebo . Four prime-boost preventive vaccine regimen compare ; participant randomize one 4 group . Participants Group 1 receive MVA-C month 0 1 , gp140/MF59 month 3 6 . Group 2 receive MVA-C gp140/MF59 month 1 3 . Group 3 receive DNA-C month 0 1 , MVA-C month 3 6 . Group 4 receive DNA-C month 0 1 , MVA-C gp140/MF59 month 3 6 . Additional study visit occur Weeks 2 , 6 , 13 , 14 , 26 , 28 , 36 , 48 . All participant contact annually 3 year ask question health . Study procedure include physical exam , blood urine collection , HIV testing , electrocardiogram , questionnaire . Some blood collect participant store used future research . Risk-reduction counseling conduct study visit .</detailed_description>
