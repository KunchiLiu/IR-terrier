	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm extremity , ≥8 cm , high grade STS ( MPNST , MFH/UPS , LMS ) MSKCC locally participate site . Subjects must localize disease potentially amenable definitive resection . The first 15 MSKCC patient Phase II portion protocol must undergo either open incisional core tumor biopsy prior initiation therapy . Patients must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See Section 10 evaluation measurable disease . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define ( ULN indicate institutional upper limit normal ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 X 109/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ( 5.6 mmol/L ) Platelets ≥100 X 109/L International normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤1.2 X ULN Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤1.2 X ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN Alanine amino , transferase ( ALT ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 X ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL ( 133 μmol/L ) Or , serum creatinine , &gt; 1.5 mg/dL : Calculated creatinine clearance ( ClCR ) ≥30 mL/min ≥50 mL/min Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio ( UPC ; appropriate appendix ) &lt; 1 Or , 24hour urine protein &lt; 1g Patients must current evidence another malignancy . Pazopanib , gemcitabine docetaxel carry category D ( positive evidence risk ) pregnancy status . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) therapy least 8 week completion therapy pregnancy test prior study entry two cycle treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Patients major surgery 4 week prior enter study , recover adverse event ≤ NCI CTC AE Grade 1 , associate surgery . Excluded consideration surgical change expect improve , e.g . removal muscle tissue . Patients must treat previously radiation , chemotherapy anticancer agent current disease . History allergic reaction hypersensitivity reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pazopanib , gemcitabine , docetaxel agent use study . Patients contraindication MRIs . Patients required concomitant treatment medication know inhibitor strong inducer isoenzyme CYP3A4 , CYP2C8 , CYP2D6 unless drug medically necessary substitute available . If acceptable substitute , special precaution take patient . Similarly , coadministration CYP3A inhibitor ( e.g . Ergot derivative , Neuroleptics , Antiarrhythmics , Immune modulators miscellaneous agent quetiapine , risperidone , clozapine , atomoxetine , inducer ( e.g . Glucocorticoids , Anticonvulsants , HIV antiviral , Antibiotics , miscellaneous agent St. John 's Wort , modafinil , pioglitazone , troglitazone , simvastatin , also avoid possible , otherwise subject caution ( e.g . increased frequency safety monitoring ) . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor PROHIBITED within 14 day prior first dose pazopanib include : Antibiotics , HIV protease inhibitor , Antifungals Antidepressants Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , include HIV , active hepatitis B C , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , poorly control diabetes psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Hepatitis B C screen patient prior initiating treatment via hepatitis B serologic marker , , HBsAg , HBs Ab , HBc Ab Hep C Antibody . If patient positive serologic marker , viral load marker ( HBVDNA Hepatitis C RNAPCR ) perform screen confirm disease well screen hepatitis C via quantitative RNAPCR . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed . HIV positive patient combination antiretroviral therapy due potential pharmacokinetic interaction pazopanib . Patients significant respiratory compromise active unexplained pneumonitis give patient would increase risk pneumonitis gemcitabine , would also confuse evaluation pneumonitis trial Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding include , limited : Active peptic ulcer disease Inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment Active diarrhea grade Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may affect absorption investigational product include , limited : Malabsorption syndrome Major resection stomach small bowel History one follow cardiovascular condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease History cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , pulmonary embolism untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month . Note : Subjects recent DVT treat therapeutic anticoagulating agent least 6 week eligible Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) ≥ 450 msec use Bazett 's formula ( append formula ) ; subject bundle branch block ( BBB ) , QTc ≥480 msec use Bazett 's formula . ) Poorly control hypertension , define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90mmHg . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . History Class III IV congestive heart failure , define New York Heart Association Classification Congestive Heart Failure [ see Appendix D description ] Evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis Administration nononcologic investigational drug within 30 day 5 half life whichever longer prior receive first dose study treatment .</criteria>
