	<brief_summary>Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) life-long incurable disease remission exacerbation . Inflammation confine rectum occurs quarter patient extremely hard treat . Many medication try order control inflammation , always work . One new medication immunosuppressing medication , tacrolimus show effective UC take orally . Unfortunately , oral use medication numerous serious side effect . In order overcome side effect , use topical rectal tacrolimus examine . Pilot study ulcerative proctitis ( inflammation confine rectum ) resistant conventional therapy demonstrate clinical remission 75 % patient although medication well absorbed line bowel , level blood low serious side effect report . The finding suggest preparation indeed effective inflammation distal bowel method administration reduces side effect . Further work , however , need undertaken validate original finding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rectal Tacrolimus Treatment Resistant Ulcerative Proctitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBDs ) life-long condition often diagnose 15 35 year age increase frequency . In developed country , IBD prevalence 100-220/100,000 2002 . More recently estimate prevalence CD UC USA 201 238 per 100,000 respectively . This indicate 620,000 CD 730,000 UC patient USA alone . It also note incidence IBD increase ethnic minority American last two decade predict IBD , previously think 'Caucasian disease ' , reach comparable level Asia Western Countries within 10-15 year . One major cost IBD treatment need hospital admission . These fall CD patient secondary increase use biological therapy , however , admission UC double last 15 year . IBD cost Australian economy 22,000,000 people $ 2.7 billion annually comparable throughout western World . Tacrolimus cyclosporin classical calcineurin inhibitor widely use immunosuppressive medication promise result UC . Calcineurin , protein phosphatase 2B ( PP2B ) , ubiquitously express cytosolic Ser/Thr protein phosphatase , highly conserve eukaryote . It ability dephosphorylate broad range protein regulate interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-4 interferon ( IFN ) γ expression , well modulate activity transcription factor like NF-κB . Enhanced NF-kB activity well describe CD UC induce proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β , IL-6 TNFα expression . It primarily reduction level cytokines clinical remission may achieve . The efficacy oral tacrolimus examine management medication resistant CD UC . Unfortunately , majority study open label one randomise control trial report UC . This demonstrate short-term clinical improvement without significant increase remission rate , potentially due low patient number . Despite , numerous open label study UC CD suggest efficacy short term promise long term data . The evidence would suggest , however , blood trough level least 10ug/L order achieve best efficacy ( therapeutic range 5-20ug/L ) , high trough level likely patient suffer adverse effect . These , unfortunately , numerous include hypertension , nausea diarrhoea , haematological abnormality , renal impairment . Increase rate skin cancer also concern , concern support animal study . Use topical tacrolimus effective treatment perioral perineal inflammation paediatric CD patient resolution symptom 75 % . Work examine topical perianal tacrolimus therapy adult CD patient also demonstrate clinical efficacy , although tacrolimus absorb well transdermally , low trough level tacrolimus detect blood . In preliminary study , use topical tacrolimus associate side effect . Long-term topical use , oral formulation , may associate increase risk skin cancer formation . Epidemiological evidence , however , would suggest risk low localise tacrolimus-treated sun-exposed skin . The recent pilot study group demonstrate 75 % ( 6/8 ) patient resistant distal colitis respond achieve remission disease follow 4 8 week tacrolimus rectal ointment8 . A dose 0.3 0.5mg/ml 3ml twice day identified majority patient induce remission . In patient tacrolimus trough level take regularly either undetectable ( &lt; 1.5 μg/L ) sub-therapeutic ( &lt; 5 μg/L ) , high , low therapeutic range ( therapeutic range 5-20 μg/L ) . The ointment well tolerate without systemic adverse effect . Use rectal tacrolimus preparation 8 patient also associate clinical response 6 patient 4 week therapy . The efficacy topical tacrolimus UC support separate pilot study examine topical tacrolimus patient resistant distal colitis . In study clinical histological improvement 10 12 patient 4 week without major side effect report preparation well tolerate . METHODOLOGY Study medication supply : The preparation tacrolimus rectal ointment undertaken respective hospital pharmacy centre . Gloves mask shall wear make preparation . The concentration tacrolimus ointment shall 0.5 mg⁄mL . Five millilitre propylene glycol slowly mixed desired amount tacrolimus powder clean glass slab . To , 70 mL paraffin liquid BP ( LP ) gradually add serial dilution triturate evenly mixed . This process repeat 125 mL paraffin white soft BP ( WSP ) . The result cream pack tube label . The preparation formulate use LP ⁄WSP base ease rectal use . Medication Stability : The cream expire 30 day room temperature 90 day 4-8 0C Administration study medication : A total 3ml study medication placebo apply rectally , via applicator , twice day patient 8-week period . The application take place prior retire bed follow breakfast morning . For shift worker application occur prior retire bed follow first meal day . Dosage schedule : 1 . Randomisation : Patients randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive tacrolimus placebo . 2 . Blinding : The trial patient clinical investigator blind randomisation . Concomitant therapy : Rectal preparation cease day prior commence trial . Patients continue oral medication commencement study . Screening visit : All patient sign inform consent prior data collection . Patient demographic record . Stool culture microscopy , blood pressure ( BP ) , full blood count ( FBC ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , urea , electrolyte ( U &amp; E ) GFR take measure locally site . Results test faxed central site Fremantle hospital within 3 day collection review . Faecal calprotectin take stored -200C . These specimen send batch dry ice every 3 month central site Fremantle Hospital analysis . Within 7 day prior week 0 flexible sigmoidoscopy perform . Two set photos take endoscopy one set distal ( within 15cm anus ) one set proximal ( 15-25cm anus ) . The region depict bad level inflammation 2 biopsy take region histological analysis . Biopsies fix block hospital site . All paraffin block send Fremantle Hospital note . Following photos histological analysis . Four additional biopsy take region RNA isolation . The biopsy region place immediately 2 tube label 'proximal ' 'distal ' contain RNAlater store -80oC . These sent batch dry ice every 3 month central site Fremantle Hospital analysis . A full Mayo score calculate confirm presence active UC ( Mayo score 6 12 required inclusion ) . Week 0 : A Mayo score calculate use screen endoscopic finding treatment initiate . Baseline IBDQ calculate BP measure Weeks 2 , 4 : A modified Mayo score calculate , BP take , FBC , ESR , CRP , U &amp; E describe IBDQ assess . The faecal calprotectin take stored -200C . Blood tacrolimus trough take , serum collect stored -20oC . The serum sent dry ice central site Fremantle Hospital assessment within 2 day collection . The medical monitor ( CIA ) Fremantle Hospital review tacrolimus trough level ensure patient safety . Week 8 withdrawal : A flexible sigmoidoscopy undertaken ± 3 day week 8 visit ( early withdrawal ) full Mayo score calculate . Photos biopsies take processed detailed screening sigmoidoscopy . Routine FBC , U &amp; E , ESR , CRP , BP measure , faecal calprotectin describe Week 12 : Follow-up phone call assess adverse event . Each histological specimen assess centrally Fremantle Hospital blind specialist gastroenterological histopathologist . These finding correlate endoscopic score photo take endoscopy . Early withdrawal study : Patients free withdraw study time . If patient withdraw due lack efficacy study preparation 4 week follow week 0 visit , eligible open label use topical tacrolimus ointment 4 week . A withdrawal flexible sigmoidoscopy require prior supply topical tacrolimus ointment . Photos take prior biopsy describe week 0 8 procedure . Routine FBC , U &amp; E , ESR , CRP , BP measure , tacrolimus trough level faecal calprotectin take 2 week therapy describe . These patient eligible analysis primary secondary end point Interim Analysis : An interim analysis independent statistician clinician 20 patient complete 8-week visit do confirm drug safety ass efficacy . This shall require prior allow study continue . mRNA expression level : Biopsies ( x4 ) take two region distal colon ( within 15cm anus 15-25cm anus ) .
