	<brief_summary>In protocol investigator plan demonstrate feasibility modular insulin management system base continuous glucose monitoring target towards avoidance hypoglycemic prolonged hyperglycemic episode ( i.e . control range ) . The protocol design challenge insulin management system meal mild exercise , demonstrate capacity avoid large glucose excursion change metabolic state . This system design - monitor meal boluses patient correct case observed/predicted insulinization ( avoidance prolong hyperglycemia ) , base coarse subjective knowledge meal amount , precise understand subject 's day day insulin treatment , continuous glucose monitoring , past insulin injection ; - predict avoid hypoglycemic event , base continuous glucose reading past insulin injection . The investigator plan enroll 12 adult Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) patient ( expect retention 10/12 ) compare glucose control performances two treatment : standard vs. new insulin management system . The protocol include total 6 admission per subject ( 4 out-patients 2 in-patients ) : screening , effort test , CGM insertion 1 , inpatient 1 , CGM insertion 2 , inpatient 2 . During 24h inpatient admission , patient challenge 30 minute mild exercise 3 meal , insulin coverage event vary depend chosen treatment , subject expose studied treatment ( repeat measure design ) .The order treatment inpatient admission randomize .</brief_summary>
