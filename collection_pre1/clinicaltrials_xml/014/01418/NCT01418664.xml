	<brief_title>Prevention Adverse Pregnancy Outcome With Vitamin D Supplementation During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency associate many chronic disease . These include cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , multiple sclerosis , breast prostate cancer . Recently , role pregnancy explore . Vitamin D deficiency find associated adverse pregnancy outcome . These include pre eclampsia , gestational diabetes mellitus , preterm labor low birth weight . Bodnar et al , evaluate role vitamin D deficiency pregnancy PE nest case control study . The investigator look role vitamin D gestational age &lt; 22 week . Women develop PE find low level vitamin D. These woman serum level vitamin D &lt; 15 ng/ml , supplement pregnancy prenatal vitamin , still find 5 fold great chance develop PE ( adjust odds ratio , 5.0 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.7-14.1 ) .Children group woman also find low level vitamin D. The author conclude vitamin D deficiency may independent factor development PE . ( 1 ) In epidemiological study Norway , involve 23,423 primigravida , rsik PE find 27 % great woman receive D supplement , compare woman receive 10-15µg/day vitamin D ( 2 ) . Circulating level 1-25 ( OH ) find low woman PE . ( 3 ) This attribute reduced expression activity 1α-hydroxylase human placenta preeclamptic pregnancy . ( 4 ) This association PE also find influenced VEGF ( Vascular endothelial growth factor ) . Active form vitamin D find increase expression VEGF , release vascular smooth cell , in-vitro study . ( 5 ) Vitamin D deficiency also associate small gestational age ( SGA ) ( 6 ) The difference find subtle Caucasians compare African-Americans West . The investigator show U shape association D level SGA . After confounder adjustment , compare serum 25 ( OH ) D 37.5-75 nmol/L , SGA odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) level &lt; 37.5 &gt; 75 nmol/L 7.5 ( 1.8 , 31.9 ) 2.1 ( 1.2 , 3.8 ) , respectively . In similar study Brooke , among Asian woman resident UK , vitamin D supplementation 1000IU third trimester , compare placebo , associate decrease incidence small gestational age ( 15 % versus 29 % ) . Investigators suggest supplementation vitamin D among Asians live UK . ( 7 ) Vitamin D deficiency relate gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) pregnant woman . Zhang et al , find vitamin D deficiency early pregnancy link increase risk GDM . Vitamin D deficiency associate 2.66-fold ( OR ( 95 % CI ) : 2.66 ( 1.01-7.02 ) ) increase GDM risk . Moreover , 5 ng/ml decrease 25- [ OH ] D concentration related 1.29-fold increase GDM risk ( OR ( 95 % CI ) : 1.29 ( 1.05-1.60 ) ) . ( 8 ) Similarly , Iranian study , woman find GDM , find low level serum 1,25 ( OH ) , compare normoglycemic woman . ( 9 ) Serum level &lt; 12 nmol/L find associate GDM . This may link fact 1,25 ( OH ) stimulate insulin secretion . Vitamin D deficiency also link increase risk cesarean section . In study 253 woman , underwent cesarean section , multivariable logistic regression analysis control race , age , education level , insurance status , alcohol use , woman 25 ( OH ) D le 37.5 nmol/liter almost 4 time likely cesarean woman 25 ( OH ) D 37.5 nmol/liter great ( adjust odds ratio 3.84 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.71 8.62 ) . ( 10 ) Poor muscular performance due vitamin D deficiency may reason increase cesarean section rate . Preterm labor , adverse pregnancy outcome , think affect maternal serum level 1,25 ( OH ) . In recently conclude RCT , comparison make 400IU , 2000IU 4000IU daily supplementation vitamin D. Women prescribe high dos significant less chance spontaneous preterm birth &lt; 37 &lt; 32 week . ( 11 ) Inflammation play key role etiology preterm labor . And vitamin D know influence production inflammatory mediator like interleukin 1 , interleukin -6 tumor necrosis factor macrophage . ( 12 ) This may reason decrease incidence preterm birth woman receive vitamin D supplementation . Birth weight newborn also affect maternal serum D level . In study neighbor Iran , 449 woman , birth weight , length apgar score significantly well woman take diet adequate calcium vitamin D. ( 13 ) Vitamin D supplementation pregnancy lead increased calcium store infant improve weight gain well . Levels &lt; 25ng/ml associated rickets osteomalacia . There positive correlation maternal neonatal cord level vitamin D. This relationship also show study part world . ( 14-16 ) This indicate newborn enter world , deficiency vitamin D , start utero . Apart affect skeletal development , also affect innate immune system newborn . In case-control study , child deficient vitamin D find prone acute respiratory tract infection . The mean serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration study group newborn low control group ( 9.12+/-8.88 ng/ml 16.33+/-13.42 ng/ml , respectively ) ( P=0.011 ) . ( 17 ) It observe infant bear D replete mother become D deficient , 8 week birth , unless supplement vitamin D. In early cross sectional study , Karachi city Atiq M , find low level vitamin D newborn breastfed . The age group 6 week 11 month . Thirty-four ( 48 % ) mother 37 ( 52 % ) infants level less 25 nmol/ L ( i.e . &lt; 10ng/ml ) . The investigator find significant correlation serum 25 ( OH ) D level infant three month age mother ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . ( 18 ) Though study carry private university hospital , majority mother belong upper socio economic class . Content vitamin D breast milk dependant upon serum level mother . Supplementation lactate mother recommend avoid deficiency newborn , norm practice . There also increase motivation exclusive breast feed first 4-6 month society . Hence prevalence vitamin D deficiency high 90 % population ( data submit publication ) , newborns risk vitamin D deficient rickets</detailed_description>
