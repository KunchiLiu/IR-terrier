	<detailed_description>Purpose aim By mean record-linkage , information two register merge retrospectively examine possible association survival breast- , colorectal- , skin cancer choice hypnotic use surgical removal cancer . We hypothesize : one- five-year survival rate radical breast- , colorectal- skin cancer surgery general anesthesia significantly high patient give intravenously administer hypnotic propofol compare survival patient expose inhalational hypnotic sevoflurane . The hypothesis base : 1 ) The knowledge opposite effect immune system two different anesthetic different genotoxic potential 2 ) The well-established association state immune system cancer growth , DNA damage cancer development , potential influence survival . Survey field Rationale current state knowledge A ) Immuno-modulation Converging evidence animal study study human cell-lines indicate different anesthetic opposite effect immune system . Commonly use inhalational hypnotic context pro-inflammatory , whereas intravenously administer hypnotic agent propofol anti-inflammatory also anti-oxidative . A clinical study indicate similar effect patient , recent review suggest `` tailor anesthetic plan patient 's need become increasingly critical , immunology help pursuit '' . More specifically , previous study investigate immunological effect different anesthetic monocyte , macrophage , natural killer cell , t-cytotoxic cell , t-helper cell . By affect t-helper cell anesthetic indirectly affect production anti-inflammatory mediator , interleukin-4 -10 . Anesthetics also affect production pro-inflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin-1 -6 . Moreover , effect could indirect block non-blocking surgical stress response via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis sympathetic nervous system . Thus , stress hormone , catecholamine cortisol , mediate inhibitory effect immune function . In highly complex way , neuroendocrine system together pro-inflammatory- anti-inflammatory cytokine augments immuno-suppressive effect . Taken together , result previous research support inhalational hypnotic immuno-suppressive mouse well human . Earlier finding also indicate adverse effect inhalational hypnotic could relate immunological process . For example , inhalational hypnotic seem increase occurrence cancer metastasis . These adverse effect find propofol . In contrast , propofol seem inhibit tumor growth reduce tendency induce metastasis . The research field immuno-modulation anesthetic recently review Kurosawa Kato . They conclude , `` clinical anesthesiologist select anesthetic choose anesthetic method careful consideration clinical situation immune status critically ill patient , regard long-term mortality , morbidity , optimal prognosis '' . A key note , `` many vitro investigation elucidate dose-dependent time-dependent immunosuppressive effect volatile ( read inhalational ) anesthetics various immune cell '' . It stress another review Meiler , `` perioperative process could responsible later adverse event '' , necessity `` understand underlie biology immunology particularly helpful pursuit '' . Thus , choice hypnotic may affect survival cancer surgery . More specifically , combine effect surgical stress burden cancer perhaps aggravate circumstance , high age malnutrition , may play salient role postoperative morbidity mortality . B ) Genotoxicity Genotoxic agent may negatively affect patient 's survival cancer surgery , connection DNA damage cancer development well-known . The potential genotoxicity inhalational anesthetic agent patient exposed staff operating room study vitro vivo . A dose-response relationship inhalational agent exposure DNA damage suggest . The technique use , rate sister chromatid exchange lymphocyte alkaline comet assay , indicator genotoxicity well validate , frequently use context . Inhalational agent seem consistently genotoxic , whereas less studied propofol seem . Project description : Retrospective , follow-up cohort study . Patients We administrative system demographic- , anesthetic- , surgical data log computer available patient expose anesthesia surgery , date January 1 , 1998 December 31 , 2009 . Data include choice hypnotic . All approx . 4500 patient operate breast- , colorectal- , skin cancer ( malignant melanoma ) extract register . Remaining demographic- , anesthetic- , surgical data interest extract patient 's individual paper file . A data base construct Statistical Program Social Sciences , SPSS ( Chicago , IL , USA ) . Accessible outcome data store Regional Oncologic Center Uppsala . Bias , especially potential major confounders , control 1 . The risk selection bias inherent major disadvantage retrospective study . Here risk consider low due non-selective use hypnotic . Misclassification error correct individual level important confounders identify group level , c.f . . 2 . The distribution different demographic characteristic two group control thorough survey every individual patient file . Data type stage cancer , well different prognostic marker also include . Any unequal distribution confounders identify . Data alcohol consumption available . 3 . Opioids also affect immune system , therefore theoretically constitute major confounders . This hold true morphine , never use intra-operatively . Synthetic opioids , fentanyl , alfentanil , remifentanil , use u intra-operatively , proven suppress immune response like morphine . On contrary , synthetic opioids may positive effect context . We use synthetic opioids every surgical patient hospital , hospital worldwide . We reason suspect uneven administration postoperative morphine two study group , also control data extraction . 4 . Nitrous oxide , impairs immune defense , also impair DNA production inhibition vitamin B12 component methionine synthetase . Nitrous oxide potential confounder fraction study population . It remain see thorough survey data , use nitrous oxide evenly distribute two study group ? 5 . Red blood cell transfusion may affect survival cancer surgery . An immuno-suppressive effect allogenic material one suggest cause . We identify patient peri-operative red blood cell transfusion , control distribution group , include subgroup analysis . 6 . A preceding subsequent anesthetic give proximity index procedure constitute important confounder must therefore identify . An executive decision make define time span Â± 1 year index operation . Patients , anesthetize besides index operation within time frame , patient anesthetized end time frame inclusion study constitute separate subgroup . Accordingly , analyze separately . We assume 10-20 % patient another general anesthetic within defined time interval . This assumption base small pilot investigation 100 patient cohort . 7 . Different adjuvant cancer therapy potent toxicity serious side-effects also register control confound point view . Linking match database The administrative database , create described , record-linked regional quality register Regional Oncologic Center ( ROC ) Uppsala . The register find &gt; 97 % completeness compare Swedish Cancer Register ( SCR ) , report mandatory regulate law . The SCR hold diagnosis contain clinical information . The ROC include quality register breast cancer , start 1992 . A register colon cancer start 1995 , another melanoma start 1996 , one rectal cancer create 1997 . These register contain information mode detection , histopathology , stage diagnosis , prognostic marker complementary treatment give . Hence , complete oncologic- outcome data available type cancer include study within defined period time . Data type stage cancer , well different prognostic marker record oncologic register extract , well data recurrence disease , vital status date cause death . The unique personal identification number replace unidentified serial number , ensure anonymity person data securing . Analysis The main endpoint comparison overall survival use time event analysis . Cumulative 1- 5-year overall survival assess use Kaplan Meier method estimate compare patient give sevoflurane propofol . In next step , Cox Proportional hazard model calculate assess risk death adjust potential effect modifier confounders . There also stratification different type tumor , cardio-pulmonary status , ASA-class etc . Hazard ratio ( HR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) present model . Subgroup analyse undertaken patient one anesthetic within defined time frame ; ) give hypnotic index procedure , b ) give hypnotic different occasion ( ) ; c ) patient one anesthetic outside defined time frame . Statistics A clinically relevant absolute difference five-year-survival would 5 % , e.g . difference 85 % 80 % , latter average one-year-survival period interest breast cancer , constitute large group study . With 3000 patient anesthetized sevoflurane , 1000 patient anesthetized propofol , 95 % power detect difference P-value &lt; 0.05 , i.e . good margin unanticipated loss data ditto exclusion . Ethics The project accept Regional Ethics Committee Jan 21 , 2009 ( 2008/350 ) . The retrospective approach create ethical consideration . Significance Undesired effect anesthesia survival strong relevance overall cancer treatment . Any suspicion dramatic side-effect potentially fatal immuno-modulation genotoxicity must investigate . If hypothesis confirm result present study use large-scale randomized control trial ( RCT ) multiple center compare two agent , turn might result change practice result positive . If hypothesis rule , choice inhalation intravenous anesthesia influence oncological consideration , important know , although also confirm RCT .</detailed_description>
