	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis responsible majority disability death develop country . Previous study show sudden clinical event correlate highly plaque composition degree plaque inflammation . These result stress importance develop non-invasive surrogate marker plaque inflammation detect asymptomatic high-risk plaque clinical setting . Dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 18F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) combine compute tomography ( CT ) show promise characterize quantify metabolic activity ( i.e. , glycolysis/ inflammation ) atherosclerosis , target presence neovessels ( DCE-MRI ) inflammatory cell macrophage ( 18F-FDG PET ) plaques animal human subject . However , several challenge need overcome prior translate image approach clinical practice . A significant obstacle adapt conventional DCE-MRI approach atherosclerosis include necessity image high spatial resolution capture plaque heterogeneity . This achieve long scan time , conflict need high temporal resolution require accurate arterial input function sample quantification contrast agent uptake . In Aim 1 , investigator develop validate novel dual-imaging sequence DCE-MRI atherosclerosis investigator acquire high temporal resolution , low spatial resolution , AIF image high spatial resolution/low temporal resolution vessel wall image allow accurate quantification contrast agent uptake within plaque . This approach compare conventional approach rabbit model atherosclerosis human subject . The limited spatial resolution conventional PET scanner impact accuracy 18F-FDG PET quantification atherosclerotic plaque partial volume effect ( PVE ) . A posteriori PVE correction method use high-resolution anatomical image acquire different image modality improve quantification , challenge since require accurate co-registration another image modality PET . MR ideal choice second imaging modality produce high-resolution anatomical image without use ionizing radiation . A combined MR/PET scanner may therefore good suit develop novel PVE correction methodology . As part Aim 2 , investigator develop validate combine MR-PET ( FDG ) image approach improve quantification atherosclerotic plaque metabolic activity . Attenuation correction base MR compare CT base attenuation correction . Approaches improve PVE correction optimal circulation time plaque image also validate rabbit human . Finally , image parameter derive improved DCE-MRI MR- PET ( FDG ) validate patient undergo carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) , primary endpoint establish relationship image histological marker plaque inflammation . Additionally , investigator assess relationship ( ) serum biomarkers , exploratory endpoint , investigator study real time PCR relationship image gene expression marker plaque vulnerability .</detailed_description>
