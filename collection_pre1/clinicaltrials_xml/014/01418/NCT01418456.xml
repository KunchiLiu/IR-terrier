	<detailed_description>Trail Procedures Visit 0 Screening , Randomisation Initial Treatment ; 1 . The researcher assign screen number . 2 . Medical history demographic record . 3 . Physical examination include height weight perform . 4 . Vital sign ( body temperature , pulse blood pressure ) record . 5 . Random capillary blood glucose measure . 6 . Blood investigation per routine clinical practice Diabetic Foot Clinic carry include : Calcium Phosphate Renal liver function Glycated haemoglobin C- Reactive Protein ( CRP ) Full blood cell count Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Blood glucose Blood also take high sensitivity C-reactive protein , procalcitonin level inflammatory marker . ( Samples store -80 deg C freezer , analyse later date ) 7 . A urine test Beta human chorionic gonadotropin test woman childbearing potential carry 8 . The foot ulcer debrided callous macerate tissue detail ulcer record follow ; 9 . Ulcer characteristic presence sign infection ( redness , swell , pain , malodour , purulent discharge ) . 10 . In order enter study , patient need clinically non- infected ulcer . If patient one ulcer , ulcer clinical sign infection large foot ulcer record target ulcer monitor study . ( The remain ulcer treat accord standard clinical practice . ) At stage inclusion/ exclusion criterion review satisfied , patient admit study . 11 . The circumference ulcer select study mark use sterile graph paper marker pen . 12 . A digital photograph take . The patient ask sign consent form part King 's College Hospital NHS Trust policy . 13 . A tissue sample ( ulcer biopsy ) send culture sensitivity 14 . The foot ulcer cleanse normal saline . A sterile non adherent dress along surgipad dress applied foot ulcer . If appropriate patient 's usual carers show dressing use give train ensure correct application dressing visit clinic . Dressing change occur accord amount exudate discharge ulcer , ie . every day , every second , third day three time week . Patients advise keep ulcer dressing dry . VASCULAR ASSESSMENT 15 . Palpation pedal pulse namely dorsalis pedis posterior tibial carry . Ulcers occur foot impalpable pedal pulse define ischaemic ulcer . 16 . If pulse impalpable , ankle- brachial pressure index transcutaneous oxygen ( TcPo2 ) measurement perform record . Patients review vascular team together vascular study . The vascular consultant , diabetes consultant patient make decision regard vascular intervention angioplasty bypass continue conservative management . 17 . Patients ischaemic foot TcPo2 monitor monthly basis . If deterioration blood supply see vascular team consider vascular intervention either by-pass angioplasty continue monitoring . 18 . A scotch cast boot ( SCB ) optimise offload ischaemic ulcer , manufacture patient impalpable pedal pulse per standard clinical practice . NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 19 . Peripheral sensation test carry use neurothesiometer determine vibration perception threshold apex toe foot ulcer . A 10g nylon monofilament apply plantar surface 1st toe , plantar surface 1st ,3rd 5th metatarsal head heel . Patients deem neuropathy vibration perception threshold abnormal filament felt plantar surface site . Ulcers occur foot abnormal vibration perception 10g filament test define neuropathic ulcer . 20 . A removable total contact cast ( RTCC ) optimise offload neuropathic ulcer , manufacture per standard clinical practice . 21 . All patient ask complete : Quality life questionnaire SF-36 EuroQol-5 questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) 22 . All patient trial give emergency contact detail . Randomisation - Patients randomise one two group - The antibiotic group - The standard treatment group Antibiotics dispense hospital pharmacy . Patients advise always two team health care professional monitoring : blind team , team know treatment group patient assign , un blind team , team know treatment group patient assign .The patient ask inform blind team group belong . Visits 1-19 The unblinded team always see patient first . Adverse event note assessed Adherence treatment assess record Details resource use patient treatment ulcer record order carry health economic evaluation . 1 . Vital sign record ( body temperature , pulse blood pressure ) . 2 . Random capillary blood glucose measure . 3 . Patients ischaemic ulcer TcPO2 measure four weekly interval week 4,8,12,16 20 . The blinded team carry follow assessment ; 4 . Ulcer characteristic ( size , depth , site ) . 5 . Presence clinical sign infection ; redness , swell , pain , malodour , purulent discharge . 6 . A tissue specimen ulcer bed sent culture sensitivity , week 4,8,12,16 20 . An ulcer swab take visit . 7 . A digital photograph take 8 . The ulcer circumference mark use sterile graph paper marker pen . 9 . The SCB RTCC check patient . 10 . The ulcer cleanse use normal saline , standard non adherent dress surgipad dress hold place bandage apply ulcer . 11 . The ulcer deem infected non- infect . 12 . The blinded team inform unblinded team whether ulcer heal ; heal , whether infect non infect , use Infectious Disease Society America/International Working Group Diabetic Foot Guidelines ( IDSA-IWGDF ) criterion infection . This confirm two member blind team If ulcer deem clinically non-infected , patient continue study , antibiotic rationalise unblinded team accord culture sensitivity result ulcer swab/biopsy . An appropriate clinical trial prescription write . 13 . Emergency contact detail check patient . 14 . Patients follow 20 week . The patient withdrawn study 20 week elapsed foot ulcer develop clinical sign infection ulcer heal patient develop side effect necessitate patient stop antibiotic therapy 72 hour withdraw Investigator reason . 15 . If patient withdraw early termination procedure complete ( per visit 20 ) . If patient withdrawn experience adverse event - Admission hospital - Amputation - Ulcer non heal - Side effect antibiotic Then detail event subsequently record patient 's note complete health economic evaluation . Visit 20 ; Last treatment visit early termination visit If ulcer heal 20 week Visit 20 last treatment visit . Early termination study carry patient heal 20 week , decides withdraw ( willing attend final visit ) ; patient develops foot ulcer clinical sign infection . If patient develop side effect antibiotic take antibiotic 72 hour patient withdrawn study . The unblinded team always see patient first . 1 . Adverse event note assess . 2 . Adherence treatment assess record . 3 . Details resource use patient treatment ulcer record order carry health economic evaluation . 4 . A physical examination carry . 5 . Vital sign record ( body temperature , pulse blood pressure ) . 6 . Random capillary blood glucose measure . 7 . Patients ischaemic ulcer TcPO2 measure . 8 . Blood collect follow investigation per routine clinic practice Calcium phosphate Renal liver function Glycated haemoglobin . C- reactive protein Full blood cell count Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Blood glucose Also blood take high sensitivity C- reactive protein procalcitonin 9 . The patient ask complete Quality life questionnaire ( SF-36 ) EuroQol-5 questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) Visit procedure blind team 10 . Standard ulcer treatment ulcer remain unhealed carry . ( removal callous , dry skin , dead tissue around ulcer scalpel , ulcer cleanse application dress ) 11 . A small tissue sample ulcer swab collect ulcer bed culture sensitivity 12 . Ulcer characteristic ( size , depth , site ) presence sign infection ( redness , swell , pain , malodour , purulent discharge ) note . 13 . The ulcer circumference mark use sterile graph paper marker pen . 14 . A digital photograph take ulcer . 15 . The blinded team inform unblinded team whether ulcer heal ; heal whether infected non infect , use Infectious Disease Society America/International Working Group Diabetic Foot Guidelines ( IDSA-IWGDF ) criterion infection . This confirm two member blind team If patient experience adverse event - Admission hospital - Amputation - Ulcer non heal - Side effect antibiotic Then detail event subsequently record patient 's note , complete health economic evaluation . Post treatment evaluation Every patient see 14 day last treatment visit 14 day visit withdrawn study . The purpose visit twofold : first act safety visit secondly , case patient heal previous visit confirm heal . Visit procedure ; Unblinded team 1 . Adverse event note assessed 2 . Body temperature , pulse blood pressure record Blinded team 3 . Standard foot ulcer care carry ulcer remains unhealed . 4 . If ulcer heal last visit , foot examine confirm healing</detailed_description>
