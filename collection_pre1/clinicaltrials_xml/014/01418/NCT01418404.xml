	<brief_summary>In literature review , thermal stimulation ( TS ) intervention effective facilitate upper extremity functional recovery stroke patient . In addition , several functional MRI study indicate thermal stimulus promote activation premotor motor cortex healthy participant . These imply possibility TS cortical reorganization . However , study explore relationship TS intervention cortical reorganization . By functional recovery stroke patient , finding brain image brain mapping , could enhance understanding TS influence brain reorganization . Regarding clinical application TS intervention improve functional performance upper extremity participant stroke , best parameter TS intervention clinical practice decide . Therefore , five-year study recruit three group stroke patient ( acute , sub-acute , chronic ) undergo TS intervention different parameter . Functional scale , kinematic data , brain image take several timeline outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Application Thermal Stimulation Functional Recovery Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The thermal stimulation ( TS ) intervention use heat cold apply alternately ( ~30minutes ) , kind temperature application common clinical neuromuscular sport rehabilitation . Moreover , study prove efficacy TS stroke . However , best parameter application different-stage stroke group clearly explore . Moreover , order discover TS intervention influence neuroplasticity , brain image brain mapping take group A ( explain ) . In addition , kinematic data also collect group A . However , above-mentioned three examination optional . Finally , functional recovery measurement ( clinical scale ) measure three group . There three group ( 90 participant group ) respective TS intervention design . In word , three sub-studies ( A , B , C ) project . Group A recruit 90 acute stroke ( ~ 30 day ) independent variable temperature TS intervention . Group B sub-acute stroke ( 3-12 month ) , undergo different frequency TS intervention . Group C target participant chronic stroke ( &gt; 1 y/o ) variation TS intensity TS application ( 30 min vs 60 mins/each session ) .</detailed_description>
