	<brief_title>Dose Response Effects Cervical Spinal Manipulative Therapy ( SMT ) Pressure Sensitivity Myofascial Trigger Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) one common manifestation myofascial pain syndrome . The total annual cost FMS $ 2298 per patient Canada . A Canadian study suggest FMS-related productivity loss cost per year $ 10,068 per patient . The average cost health resource Canada 30 % high FMS patient compare non-FMS patient prevalence FMS Canada 1.1 % , leading total 340 thousand Canadians suffer FMS . As result , annual economic burden FMS Canadian healthcare system $ 425 million . Typically , FMS patient widespread musculoskeletal pain associate non-specific tender point . There increase prevalence active myofascial trigger point ( MTrPs ) contribute widespread musculoskeletal pain associate FMS patient . MTrPs identify hyperirritable muscular nodule locate within taut band skeletal muscle classify latent active . Studies show active latent MTrPs play determinant role yet fully understood pathogenesis FMS . There many common pathophysiological theory exist MTrP formation include metabolic , biochemical , motor endplate dysfunction , neurogenic phenomenon . MTrPs may initiate sensitization within common neurologic segment specific tissue contain MTrP . The physiological change occur MTrP secondary increase responsiveness neuron within central nervous system lead increased nociception increase perception pain . Currently variety therapeutic technique establish treat MTrPs include spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) . SMT may attenuate nociceptive component spinal pain MTrPs . SMT increase pressure pain threshold ( PPTs ) lead mechanical hypoalgesia MTrPs paraspinal muscle . Preliminary data collect Srbely et al . show significant increase PPTs infraspinatus MTrPs cSMT C5-C6 spinal segment compare sham procedure . The measure PPT method quantify patient 's perception pain MTrP . PPTs define least amount pressure stimulus subject perceives pain upon application pressure form force . The appropriate dosage ( frequency application ) SMT need achieve optimal pain relief patient MTrPs establish . Haas et al . perform pilot randomize control trial examine dose response relationship SMT cervicogenic headache . The result show dose-response relationship , increase dose SMT lead decreased frequency intensity headache . Additionally , Haas colleague conduct pilot study make preliminary identification number chiropractic manipulation require decrease chronic low back pain disability . The result show positive dose-response relationship SMT low back pain . Dose-response MTrPs yet establish current literature . This preliminary work determine proper dose-response cSMT treatment MTrPs one single visit . Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect cervical SMT PPT MTrP infraspinatus muscle enhance and/or extend 2nd cSMT give single subject visit . H1 : There statistically significant increase PPTs MTrP infraspinatus muscle second cervical SMT , compare first . Specific Aim 2 : To determine effect two cervical SMTs PPTs MTrP infraspinatus muscle present 48 hour follow-up . Data collect descriptive purpose hypothesis generation . Studies show manual therapy include SMT , cost effective method treat chronic pain FMS . Currently , treatment protocol arbitrarily select base opinion clinical experience . Providing proper guideline MTrP SMT increase effectiveness treatment plan decrease financial cost FMS patient healthcare system . For preliminary work , look MTrP mechanism best do isolation FMS therefore subject without FMS use .
