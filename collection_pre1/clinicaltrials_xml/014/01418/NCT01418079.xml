	<brief_summary>A cerebral oximeter device use light measure amount oxygen within brain . It similar device measure level oxygen tip finger , know pulse oximeter . The cerebral oximeter consist sensor place forehead emits detects amount light absorb . This study determine accurate device compare display value monitor blood sample take simultaneously arterial blood wrist venous blood neck . In order test device suitable range , level oxygen within blood reduce control manner reduction inspire oxygen concentration . This equivalent ascend altitude 16,000 foot . The study conduct healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This calibration validation study near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) device design measure cerebral tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively . This achieve compare NIRS-derived cerebral tissue oxygen saturation calculate value derive simultaneous arterial jugular venous blood sample . At present FDA adopt standard publish 2005 International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) , entitle ISO 9919 . This set technical specification guideline pulse oximeter , share certain technical similarity cerebral oximeter . In particular , Annex EE detail conduct control desaturation study calibration pulse oximeter equipment . Specifically , fraction inspire oxygen deliver test subject vary achieve series target steady state saturation period range arterial oxygen saturation 70 - 100 % . While cerebral oximeter differ pulse oximeter term measure ( brain tissue versus arterial blood ) FDA maintain requirement examine data human volunteer study arterial oxygen saturation range 70 - 100 % . Several FDA-approved cerebral oximeter validate similar manner . The device control inspire gas concentration RespirAct , permit precise reduction arterial oxygen saturation also maintain arterial carbon dioxide level precise level . The study consist 2 sequence : - First sequence : reduction arterial oxygen saturation approximately 5 % increment 100 70 % , maintain arterial carbon dioxide level 40 mmHg , follow return room air period supplemental oxygen . - Second sequence : reduction arterial oxygen saturation approximately 5 % increment 100 70 % , maintain arterial carbon dioxide level different level , follow return room air period supplemental oxygen .</detailed_description>
