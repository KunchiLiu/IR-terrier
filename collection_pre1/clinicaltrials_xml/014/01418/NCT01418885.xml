	<brief_summary>SIVD characterise extensive cerebral white matter lesion ( WML ) lacunar infarct deep grey white matter structure . The relationship SIVD cognition unclear , part methodological inconsistency across study . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) non-invasive water diffusion technique use quantitatively measure degree directionality displacement distribution water molecule . 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) valuable tool assessment several biochemical compound brain vivo , N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , myoinositol ( mI ) , Choline ( Cho ) Creatine ( Cr ) . There report consider relationship among MRS , DTI cognitive impairment SIVD . Combining MRS DTI may provide valuable information pathophysiological change underlie DTI abnormality help u good understand SIVD process . It propose pathogenesis SIVD relate cerebral small vessel disease cause various mechanism . Inflammation play important role pathogenesis SIVD . The examination inflammatory marker relation VaD might benefit early treatment . In study apply neuropsychological test , conventional MRI scanning , DTI , 1H-MRS technique inflammatory marker estimate neuropsychological profile white matter characteristic image patient SIVD . Moreover , relationship WML cognitive function impairment also investigate . It could possible gain reliable data benefit early diagnosis treatment cognitive impairment SIVD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Contributions white matter lesion cognitive impairment patient subcortical ischemic vascular disease 1 . Extensive neuropsychological test include MMSE cover 5 cognitive domain include memory , executive , visuospatial , attention language function would perform patient SIVD normal elderly control match age gender . The patient would divide VaD VCIND group . 2 . Age-related white matter change rating scale , visual rating scale develop Wahlund , would use qualitative measure locate WML . 3 . Correlation analysis hierarchical multiple regression analysis would use examine relationship general cognitive function WML . 2 . Evaluation microstructural white matter lesion patient subcortical vascular cognitive impairment use diffusion tensor image 1 . SIVD patient divide VaD VCIND group normal elderly control match age gender would recruit . DTI image would acquire , fractional anisotropy ( FA ) , mean diffusivity ( MD ) normal-appearing white matter cerebral lobe would determine . 2 . These diffusion measurement compare across 3 group , significant difference would perform correlation test comprehensive cognitive function . 3 . Evaluation lesion thalamus paraventricular white matter region SIVD patient use 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy diffusion tensor image 1 . SIVD patient divide VaD VCIND group normal elderly control match age gender would recruit . The quantitative analysis N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , myoinositol ( mI ) , Choline ( Cho ) Creatine ( Cr ) resonance signal region interest locate thalamus paraventricular white matter region would measure . Ratios NAA/ Cr , mI/ Cr Cho/ Cr would calculate three group . 2 . Conventional MRI DTI scan receive , FA MD value white matter bilateral region would measure respectively . 3 . These diffusion measurement would compare across 3 group , significant difference would perform correlation test comprehensive cognitive function . 4 . Clinical significance serum inflammatory marker SIVD patient 1 . SIVD patient divide VaD VCIND group normal elderly control match age gender would recruit . The serum level sCD40L , IL-6 , hsCRP detect enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) fix time nephelometry method subject , respectively . 2 . The relationship would describe among inflammatory factor WML , cognitive impairment patient SIVD .</detailed_description>
