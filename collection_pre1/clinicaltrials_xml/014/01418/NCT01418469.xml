	<brief_summary>Studies rest human muscle show ingestion branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) : leucine , valine isoleucine anabolic effect muscle protein metabolism . However , effect BCAA intake protein metabolism exercise less clear . When BCAA supply single amino acid , without amino acid and/or carbohydrate , effect observe protein kinetics . On hand , ingestion BCAA running appear reduce catabolic effect run muscle protein metabolism . These experiment perform mixture BCAA without carbohydrate form complete meal food protein basis . Therefore , still unknown whether protein meal , contain substantial amount BCAA beneficial exercise induce anabolic effect . Whey Casein protein contain substantial amount BCAA contrast Soy protein . Therefore , hypothesize milk-based protein well physiological source BCAA exercise lead protein anabolism . Most available study carry young fit human hardly data available increase population elderly . Therefore still unknown whether BCAA rich protein meal enhance anabolic effect exercise older individual . Besides sarcopenia , substantial part elderly suffering chronic systemic disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . COPD represent important health care problem . COPD fourth lead cause death third lead cause worldwide 2020 . Besides local impairment , COPD chronic waste disease , associate alteration intermediary metabolism . Substantial disturbance find BCAA ( relate ) metabolism patient rest exercise . It might therefore clinical relevance study metabolic effect BCAA rich protein meal patient COPD rest exercise .</brief_summary>
