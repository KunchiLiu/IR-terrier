	<brief_summary>The advance treatment prevent maternal HIV transmission neonate groundbreaking . As result , number new perinatally-infected child U.S. small . Subsequent improvement treatment HIV-infected infant child equally remarkable , ensure previously infect American child survive approach adolescence . In addition , number HIV-infected adolescent worldwide grow substantially resource-poor country country increase level health care . Therefore , global cohort child live HIV infection since birth age adolescence . Little definitively know impact HIV infection treatment maturation process child . AMP prospective cohort study design define impact HIV infection antiretroviral therapy pre-adolescents adolescent perinatal HIV infection . Domains investigated include growth sexual maturation , metabolic risk factor cardiovascular disease , cardiac function , bone health , neurologic , neurodevelopment , language , hear behavioral function , sexually transmit infection ( STI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective AMP : 1 . To define impact HIV infection ART growth pubertal development ( hormonal regulation ) , along cognitive , academic , social development , pre-adolescents adolescent perinatal HIV infection move adolescence adulthood . 2 . To identify infectious non-infectious complication HIV disease , include toxicity antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . 3 . To investigate : - Cognitive behavioral change time , include medication adherence , family social function , high risk behavior risky sexual behavior , licit illicit drug use , alcohol use ; - Changes language hearing ; - Changes glucose metabolism , body composition , bone mineralization ; - Changes lipid metabolism risk factor cardiovascular disease ; - Risk factor secondary transmission HIV ; - The occurrence clinical course cervical HPV infection among female . The domain-specific aim AMP : 1 . Growth sexual maturation : To longitudinally track growth sexual maturation factor influence growth maturation HIV-infected child compare HIV-exposed uninfected child . 2 . Metabolic risk factor cardiovascular disease : To characterize emergence abnormal glucose metabolism , lipid abnormality , body composition risk factor cardiovascular disease identify contribute influence HIV-infected child compare HIV-exposed uninfected child . 3 . Cardiac function : To estimate prevalence cardiac structural functional abnormality HIV-infected child youth compare HIV-exposed uninfected child . 4 . Bone mineral density : To estimate difference bone mineral density HIV-infected child compare HIV-exposed uninfected child identify factor contribute abnormal bone mineralization . 5 . Neurologic , neurodevelopment , language , behavioral function : - To examine cognitive behavioral outcome HIV-infected child adolescent , include high risk behavior risky sexual behavior , licit illicit drug use , alcohol use , neurodevelopmental impairment , school achievement compare HIV-exposed uninfected control cohort . - To examine non-adherence antiretroviral therapy predictor non-adherence among HIV-infected child receive ART . - To examine family psychosocial factor associate emotional behavioral problem . 6 . Adolescent gynecology STI infection : - To evaluate incidence risk factor acquire STIs/vaginal infection ( C. trachomatis , N. gonorrhea , T. vaginalis , syphilis , genital wart , HPV , HSV ) males female , addition bacterial vaginosis female . - To evaluate incidence , predictor , outcomes pregnancy .</detailed_description>
