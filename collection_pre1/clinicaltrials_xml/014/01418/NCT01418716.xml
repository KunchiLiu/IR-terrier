	<brief_summary>The TRANSIT program program TRANSform InTerprofessional clinical practice improve cardiovascular prevention primary care . It address priority primary care relevant Chronic Care Model ( Wagner 2001 ) : self-management support , delivery-system design , management clinical information . The program include : - case manager coordinate provide care follow ; - clinical protocol tool support interprofessional systematic follow ; - training clinician ; - patient 's personalized cardiovascular health booklet ; - tool promote group session patient education cholesterol , hypertension , diabetes . The general OBJECTIVE trial evaluate compare two STRATEGIES implement TRANSIT program Family Medicine Groups ( FMGs ) : 1. facilitation , 2. passive diffusion . Passive diffusion usual strategy clinician implement intervention program . Facilitation strategy whereby facilitator provide support team clinicians help introduce change require implement program practice . The hypothesis facilitation efficacious implement program passive diffusion : - enhance provision cardiovascular preventive care ; - enhance interprofessional collaboration ; - enable efficaciously implementation new clinical process ; - improve patient clinical outcome ; - cost short term , positive economic impact long term ; - less `` undesired effect '' type relate implementation . To test hypothesis , assess efficacy implementation strategy enhance interprofessional collaboration well support patient management condition . Impact provision care , interprofessional collaboration , clinical process , patient clinical outcome ( value , therapeutic target , lifestyle habit ) evaluate . Moreover , implementation cost relate strategy estimate . We complement trial qualitative method document perception clinician , facilitator , patient member family regard TRANSIT program , implementation strategy observe change clinical practice outcomes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial SETTING : Nine Family Medicine Groups ( FMGs ) take part study . FMGs primary care clinic deliver family medicine service . They include physician nurse , collaborate health professional . Eligible FMGs meet follow criterion : 1 . 2 physician , 1 nurse , 1 community pharmacist , 1 member medical administrative support , 1 health professional ( nutritionist , kinesiologist , psychologist ) accept participate collaborate facilitation activity , FMG assign facilitation group ; 2 . 1 physician , 1 nurse , 1 community pharmacist 1 health professional ( nutritionist , psychologist , kinesiologist ) accept play role internal facilitation team , FMG assign facilitation group ; 3. room available case manager nurse equivalent one day/week 15 month ; 4 . 100 eligible patient accept participate study , minimum 15 patient per physician participant . All FMGs TRANSIT study give access TRANSIT program , supportive clinical tool cliniques , case manager nurse . Training offer use electronic directory health resource motivational interview . RANDOMIZATION : Prior randomization , clinician assign one FMG . Each FMG pair 2 others level CVD preventive care ( score &lt; 6 ≥6 ) , estimate questionnaire `` Assessment Chronic Illness Care '' ( ACIC ) . Usually , medical clinic report score 5 less baseline . Participating FMGs ( n=9 ) randomly assign facilitation ( n=6 ) passive diffusion ( n=3 ) . FMGs randomize simultaniously blocs 3 . For bloc , 2:1 ratio ( facilitation : passive diffusion ) respect . Randomization stratify fonction ACIC score ( score &lt; 6 score ≥6 ) . Because small number participate FMGs , group GMFs bloc 3 accord ACIC score ensure complete bloc find randomization stratum . ANALYSIS : For variable , multivariable analysis model take account intracluster correlation ( linear/SAS PROC MIXED ) continuous categorical variable ( logistic/PROC GENMOD ) develop . Significative variable ( p &lt; 0.2 ) bivariable model include study group include multivariable model . We apply backward selection procedure include final model variable statistically significant p &lt; 0.1 .</detailed_description>
