	<brief_summary>Adequate tissue oxygenation require effective white blood cell function bactericidal activity . Decreased tissue oxygenation risk factor perioperative wound infection . Regional anesthetic technique result functional sympathetic block may increase tissue oxygenation . The purpose study evaluate change tissue oxygenation use non-invasive Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) device . The current study evaluate change tissue oxygenation follow regional anesthetic technique ( peripheral nerve blockade neuraxial technique caudal block ) pediatric patient ) . Regional anesthesia induce sympathetic blockade improve tissue oxygenation .</brief_summary>
