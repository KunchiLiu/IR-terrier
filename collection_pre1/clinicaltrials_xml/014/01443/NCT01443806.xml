	<detailed_description>Oseltamivir beneficial treatment mild influenza . When give mouth , oseltamivir phosphate ( OP ) , parent drug , rapidly absorb rapidly convert oseltamivir carboxylate ( OC ) carboxylesterase enzyme ( CES1 ) gut , plasma liver . The mean time maximum concentration OP 2 hour OC 4 . Plasma protein bind ~42 % OP &lt; 3 % OC . The latter volume distribution steady state IV dose 23 26 L similar extracellular water , consistent polar nature low protein binding . OC OP renally excrete via glomerular filtration active secretion via organic anion transporter proximal renal tubule . In healthy subject , oseltamivir carboxylate half life 6-11 hour , achieve steady-state within 3 day ( bd dose ) high AUC Day 7 compare Day 1 . Oseltamivir associate bizarre behaviour acute confusion . Since report , similar event also associate inhaled zanamivir , suggest influenza rather drug responsible . Because OP lipophilic OC , cross blood brain barrier easily OC . However , plasma CSF ratio 4 healthy volunteer low substance , two 3.5 % OP OC , respectively . The low OP ratio probably due actively export OC brain P-glycoprotein pump . In vitro mouse study demonstrate OP OC substrate glycoprotein P ( P-gp ) transporter brain distribution OC affect P-gp activity . PK simulation predict level OP would within range exposure observe clinical study without neuropsychiatric adverse effect . One individual subject ( individual X ) SEA004 `` Long Term Influenza Prophylaxis Inhaled Zanamivir Oral Oseltamivir '' carboxylesterase 1 ( CES1 ) gene mutation may affect oseltamivir phosphate conversion . This mean conversion OP OC subject substantially low normal population . This important finding relevant antiviral efficacy also potentially toxicity OP antiviral activity may play role toxicity potentially neuroexcitatory compound . On basis vitro data , risk cardiac toxicity existent therapeutic dos . OP variable effect hERG ( human ether go go K+ channel cardiac muscle ) concentration far excess achieve therapeutic dos ; OC proarrhythmic effect . Given OP penetrates blood brain barrier pump P-glycoprotein , high plasma concentration OP could result increase CNS concentration individual either reduce carboxylesterase activity , infant volunteer study and/or reduce P-glycoprotein activity . Human carboxylesterase 1 ( CES1 ) polymorphisms CES1 member multigene family serine esterases involve drug metabolism activation well biological process . The study Shi et al report correlation oseltamivir hydrolysis OP OC concentration CES1 . The gene encode CES1 long arm chromosome 16 ( 16q13-22.1 ) , consist 14 exon span 30kb . Several study identify CES1 gene polymorphism promoter cod region try relate polymorphism variation hydrolysis activity protein . A study Zhu HJ et al present potentially 2 functional polymorphism locate exon 4 ( Gly143Glu ) 6 ( Asp260fs ) impair CES1 hydrolytic activity methylphenidate vitro . However , CES1 variant ( V21I , R182H ) high rate oseltamivir metabolism compare wild-type . All subject report recruit Japanese European population . Therefore , would important investigate CES1 gene Thai population . Oseltamivir efficacy may well compromised individual convert OP OC data prevalence mutation/polymorphism , therefore , number individual may benefit form oseltamivir unknown . It important study carboxylesterase gene order characterise inheritance family individual X conduct prevalent study e.g . store serum bank part PK study oseltamivir patient .</detailed_description>
