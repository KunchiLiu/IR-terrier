	<brief_summary>Iron essential micronutrient play important role cellular function microorganism . Both iron deficiency iron excess early week life severe effect neurodevelopment may persist adulthood may correct restoration normal iron level . Iron overload remain significant concern preterm infant low level iron-binding protein immature antioxidant system . The aim study evaluate iron supplementation required/necessary VLBW Very Low Birth Weight ( less 1500 gram ) assess efficacy safety iron supplementation practice VLBW preterm infant implement Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) Ha'Emek Medical Center , Afula , Israel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective 1 . The aim study investigate presence level Cryptic LPI pre term infant plasma enteral iron supplementation . 2 . To assess iron status preterm infant correlate clinical parameter : blood transfusion give amount blood obtain routine laboratory analysis , amount daily iron intake diet ( human milk formula ) 3 . To identify preterm infant risk iron deficiency iron overload . 4 . To investigate laboratory test , Hepcidin CHr , assessment iron metabolism preterm infant . Secondary objective To review current guideline use monitor iron status prevention iron deficiency VLWP . To implement future new guideline monitor iron therapy iron supplementation pre term infant result suggest change current policy . Treatment guideline : Erythropoietin administrate . Restrictive red cell transfusion guideline follow . All premature infant include study receive Vitamin E supplementation currently use NICU ward . Iron supplementation IPC dose 4 mg/kg/day elemental iron start 4 week age soon 120 ml/kg/day enteral feeding tolerate give together first morning meal Patients Methods Study population : newborn infant VLBW bear 30 week less gestational age admit Ha'Emek Medical Center , NICU screen study eligibility . The estimate number patient include study 50 period one year Inclusion criterion : VLBW / bear 30 week less gestational age schedule receive enteral iron supplementation part standard protocol currently use NICU . Birth weight inclusion exclusion criterion preterms born 30 week less . Exclusion criterion : Major physical anomaly , renal cardiac disease , newborn underwent major surgery study period , acute chronic fetal blood loss , hemolytic anemia , refusal receive parental consent . Laboratory analysis : Complete blood count include reticulocyte count CHr . Serum iron , Transferrin , C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , erythropoietin , ferritin Serum Hepcidin serum Cryptic LPI . The blood sample obtain 3 hs oral iron administration . The blood test collect time necessary routine blood test . The serum collect last 72 hs apart clinical event : sepsis , NEC Necrotizing Enterocolitis , Intra ventricular hemorrhage , severe illness blood transfusion . Complete blood count include reticulocyte count CHr ( 0.5 cc blood EDTA ) , perform cell counter Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory . Serum laboratory analyse 2.5 cc blood centrifuge ( 2 h extraction ) 0.25 cc serum conserve -700 C hepcidin analysis , 1 cc serum conserve -700 C Cryptic LPI analysis . Serum iron , Transferrin , C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , erythropoietin ferritin analysis perform Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory day blood extraction immediately blood centrifugation ( 0.5 cc serum ) . Iron saturation calculate serum iron transferrin result . Serum hepcidin measure ELISA use kit EIA-4705 , DRG Instruments GmbH , Germany , Frauenbergstr Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory follow kit instruction . Serum Cryptic LPI measure Aferrix Ltd , Rehovot , Israel . Serum sample obtain 3 different time : 1 . Before start iron supplementation ( maximum one week ) . 2 . At begin iron supplementation order assess early sign erythropoiesis , iron overload free iron ( day 4 - 7 day supplementation ) . 3 . Before discharge hospitalization order asses iron metabolism sings iron deficiency ( At least 2 week supplementation ) . Demographic perinatal data collect , data include : Ethnic origin , gender , gestational age , birth weight , Apgar score , adverse event neonatal period include mechanical ventilation , infection , antibiotic therapy jaundice . Number amount blood transfusion , Amount blood obtain routine analysis calculate number blood test . Time introduction enteral feeding , kind daily amount human milk formula , amount daily iron intake diet . Time iron supplementation , dose change , day without iron supplementation summarize . Accumulative amount iron supplement till discharge , calculate mean iron supplementation per day per gram weight gain also summarize . Follow-up weight gain . Perinatal morbidity , complication . Adverse reaction relate iron treatment : skin rash , vomit , bloody stool NEC . Maternal last red blood count admission delivery record . Maternal iron , transferrin , ferritin level Hb electrophoresis present maternal record ,</detailed_description>
