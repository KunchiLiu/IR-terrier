	<brief_summary>This investigation examine effect consume structure , portion-controlled , low-glycemic index diet ( commercially available Nutrisystem-D program ) several indicator glycemic stability variability among participant type 2 diabetes . Results portion-controlled diet compare participant ' usual diet randomize cross-over trial . The investigator expect participant exhibit great glycemic stability ( e.g. , time euglycemic range ) less glycemic variability ( e.g. , small mean amplitude glycemic excursion ) consume Nutrisystem D program , compare usual diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate glycemic stability variability response two diet : usual diet commercially available portion-controlled diet . The commercially available diet Nutrisystem-D program , consist pre-packaged meal snack supplement grocery item , include fruit , vegetable , dairy item . This trial randomize cross-over trial 15 patient type 2 diabetes ( weight stable least 3 month prior medication stable throughout trial ) . Participants consume diet 2-week period . During diet period , participant wear blind ( i.e. , provide feedback ) continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device ass glycemic stability variability , instructed keep detail record food beverage intake physical activity . The two diet/assessment period separate 1-week washout period dietary instruction give outcome measure . Laboratory value ( HbA1c , glucose , insulin , lipid panel ) physical measure ( height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure ) assess baseline descriptive purpose . Primary Hypothesis : A significantly great percentage CGM reading fall euglycemic range ( 71-180 mg/dl ) consumption Nutrisystem-D program , compare Usual Diet . Secondary Hypothesis : Participants significantly small area curve , mean amplitude glycemic excurisions , mean , standard deviation , interquartile range glucose value , small percentage value hypo- ( &lt; /= 70 mg/dl ) hyperglycemic ( &gt; 180 mg/dl ) range consumption Nutrisystem-D program , compare Usual Diet .</detailed_description>
