	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 randomize , single center , dose-escalation study design evaluate safety immunogenicity live , replication competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-H5N1Influenza Vietnam 1194 Hemagglutinin ( HA ) ( Ad4-H5-Vtn ) . Determining optimal route dose recombinant platform greatly accelerate investigation vector influenza vaccine HIV vaccine platform . Intranasal tonsillar administration vaccine separately assess . The oral enteric-coated capsule also assess 10 outpatient use similar blood sampling comparison . The Ad4-H5-Vtn orally administer enteric-coated capsule already evaluate ascend dose Phase 1 study , dosages high 10 ( 11 ) viral particle ( vp ) . The primary goal study evaluate safety ascend dosage Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine follow intranasal tonsillar administration . A dosage dosages select evaluate humoral , cellular , mucosal immune response vector insert gene . The Ad4-H5-Vtn initiate 10 ( 3 ) vp . Once safety establish initial dose , second round test begin next ten-fold high dose . The Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine assess three participant dosage level . The maximum viral dose administer tonsillar route 10 ( 8 ) vp . In addition clinical laboratory monitoring safety , principal assessment shed Ad4-H5-Vtn virus rectal , cervicovaginal , throat , nasal swab , assessment antibody ( mucosal systemic ) response HA Ad4 virus . When safety confirm three participant give dosage level , next high dose group enrol . If one grade 3 great toxicity ( pre-specified Grade 2 toxicity , see Section 3.4 ) attributable vaccine observe , group expand dose . If second attributable grade 3 great toxicity ( pre-specified Grade 2 toxicity , see Section 3.4 ) observe , dose reduce one level group expand . Up 25 Ad4-seronegative individual enrol maximum tolerate dose fully evaluate safety immunogenicity protocol . All participant follow 28 day follow immunization , 8 26 week evaluate long-term toxicity persistence immunity . Tonsillar Participants receive booster dose vaccine [ SK1 ] 26-week visit see follow-up visit Weeks 30 34 . Household intimate contact also enrol monitor Adenovirus HAI antibody .</brief_summary>
