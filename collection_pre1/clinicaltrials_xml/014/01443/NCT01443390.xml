	<brief_summary>When patient advance cancer consults member Phase I drug development team , investigator utilize information possible try select therapy patient best chance work . This information include : 1 . Past publish information 2 . Clinical experience judgement 3 . Immunohistochemistry specific target ( e.g. , ER ) 4 . Standard sequencing ( e.g. , K-Ras ) method available . The investigator new tool warrant early exploration role might eventually play process select best therapy individual patient . The basis current ancillary exploratory study gain initial experience operational aspect whole genome sequence setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To measure time biopsy completion final analysis Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) patient tumor non-tumor sample . 2 . To examine frequency useable sequence data obtain function tumor volume receive percent tumor involvement biopsy 3 . To identify frequency potential target pathways therapy discover . 4 . To observe evidence anti-tumor activity treatment note would genome sequence correlated activity .</detailed_description>
