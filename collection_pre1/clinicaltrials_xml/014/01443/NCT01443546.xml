	<brief_summary>The project randomize , control , prospective study oocyte donor compare safety efficacy trigger ovulation use combination two drugs—GnRH agonist low dose hCG—versus trigger ovulation standard hCG dose alone standard GnRH trigger alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dual Trigger Ovulation Oocyte Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population consist young woman , age 21 34 , present facility desire donate oocytes meet FDA program requirement donation . Participants randomize one three treatment intervention trigger ovulation : 1 ) standard dose hCG , 2 ) leuprolide acetate 2 mg alone , 3 ) combination two drug low dosage ( leuprolide acetate 2 mg hCG 1500 IU ) . Study participant choose repeat oocyte donation course study trial , consent participate trial , randomize cross-over manner subsequent trial . Following randomization , clinical care study subject non-participant oocyte donor . Participants three study arm undergo standard ovarian stimulation protocol gonadotropin , standard individualize adjustment medication dose , standard criterion administration ovulation trigger dose , standard egg retrieval procedure . The recipient population recruit woman , age 18 55 , present center wish become pregnant use donor oocyte . All prospective participant meet Center Reproductive Medicine ( CRM ) criterion recipient donate egg eligible participate , wish . If prospective recipient consent participate study , would match either donor participate study ( receive one standard trigger ovulation ) donor participate study whose medication trigger ovulation randomize one three group : standard dose hCG , Leuprolide acetate , combination low dose hCG Leuprolide acetate . A recipient choose participate study additional test procedure one would normally order receive donate egg .</detailed_description>
