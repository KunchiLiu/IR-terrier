	<brief_summary>Colostrum , mother ' early breastmilk , contain multiple factor provide immune protection low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant , population high risk hospital-acquired infection . However , critical illness first day life often prevent initiation enteral feed , place infant even high risk morbidity include feed intolerance infection . Oropharyngeal administration propose alternative route delivery colostrum immune benefit provide . Research animal adult human model support oropharyngeal administration potentially safe effective mode delivery immune therapy . Immune component colostrum , secretory IgA , may direct indirect effect immune system . The purpose propose randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study determine effect oropharyngeally administer colostrum ( OAC ) immune stimulation VLBW infant , measure secretory IgA ( sIgA ) level . In addition measure sIgA response OAC investigator also collect clinical data determine OAC effect tolerance enteral feeding rate infection . The investigator hypothesize OAC moderate effect salivary secretory IgA concentration VLBW infant . If proven efficacious , utilization OAC VLBW infant could far reach consequence highly fragile baby include low rate infection , improved tolerance enteral feeding , short NICU stay .</brief_summary>
