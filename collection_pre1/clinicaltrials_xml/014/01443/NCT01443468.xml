	<brief_summary>Background : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome ( LFS ) genetic condition increase risk type cancer . LFS may lead cancer bone connective tissue , breast , brain . It may also increase risk certain type leukemia cancer . The know cause LFS change ( call mutation ) gene know TP53 . However , people LFS TP53 mutation . Researchers want study possible genetic cause LFS , factor may increase decrease cancer risk people syndrome . Objectives : - To learn type cancer occur individual LFS . - To study role TP53 gene development cancer . - To look possible gene cause LFS - To study effect LFS diagnosis family . - To determine environmental factor gene change person cancer risk associate LFS . Eligibility : - Individuals family personal medical history cancer consistent LFS . - Individuals family personal medical history cancer meet diagnosis LFS , history suggestive LFS ( meet diagnosis so-called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome ) - Individuals certain rare cancer - Individuals family personal history TP53 gene mutation , without related cancer ( ) . Design : - Participants fill medical history questionnaire family history questionnaire . - Blood sample collect DNA storage . Cheek cell sample may collect blood obtain DNA . Participants choose cancer screen blood test , image study , exam . - Participants complete questionnaire worry cancer , stress level , cop strategy . Diet physical activity questionnaire also give . Other psychological test may give need . - Participants monitor several year , regular followup visit National Institutes Health , indicate . Any change health cancer status record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome ( LFS ) dominantly-inherited cancer predisposition syndrome associate lifetime risk approximately 90 % age 60 numerous cancer type , notably bone soft-tissue sarcoma , breast cancer , brain tumor , leukemia , adrenal cortical carcinoma - Classic LFS define 1 ) A proband sarcoma diagnose 45 year age , 2 ) first-degree relative cancer 45 year age , 3 ) first- second-degree relative cancer diagnose 45 year age sarcoma age . Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome ( LFL ) , inclusive diagnostic criterion , share feature LFS meet strict LFS diagnostic criterion - TP53 identify underlying cause LFS 1990 . A TP53 mutation identify approximately 70 % classic LFS 40 % LFL - Although screen LFS patient certain cancer lead early detection , favorable impact quality life overall survival result screen show . Currently , standard recommend screen protocol either adult child LFS OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate define clinical spectrum quantify cumulative cancer risk individual LFS LFL - To develop cancer screen program individual LFS LFL - To identify genetic determinant , environmental factor , gene-environment interaction potentially modify cancer risk high-risk individual - To explore plausibility lifestyle risk-reducing intervention - Evaluate psychological social functioning effect LFS individual family - To create annotated biospecimen repository LFS-related material translational Research ELIGIBILITY : - A family personal medical history cancer consistent diagnosis LFS LFL ; , - A personal history germline TP53 mutation ; , - A first- second- degree relative TP53 mutation carrier , regardless mutation status ; , - A personal history three LFS-related primary cancer ; , - A personal history adrenal cortical carcinoma choroid plexus carcinoma age DESIGN : - Long-term prospective cohort study collect data many individual LFS permissible order precisely evaluate main aim - Medical/pathology record review ascertain family history verify diagnosis LFS . Questionnaires administer gather etiologic risk factor data . - Participants offer option undergo screen protocol follow prospectively . Biospecimens collected investigate cancer etiology mechanism carcinogenesis . - Clinical genetic testing offer appropriate education counseling . Genetic test optional , require protocol aspect . - We offer anti-cancer therapy ; consultation treatment recommendation cancer diagnose study offer available .</detailed_description>
