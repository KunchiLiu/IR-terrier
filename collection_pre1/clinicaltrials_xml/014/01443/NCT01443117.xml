	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Two Pneumococcal Vaccines HIV-Infected Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumococcus common bacterial opportunistic infection HIV-infected child , lead cause bacterial pneumonias HIV-infected pregnant non-pregnant adult . Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV-23 ) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV-13 ) two vaccine use prevention pneumococcal ( PNC ) disease . The PPV-23 vaccine recommend Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) HIV-infected adult , include HIV-infected pregnant woman . The PCV-13 vaccine recommend CDC use child , include HIV-infected child . Studies show PCV-13 vaccine like PCV-13 safe use healthy pregnant woman , study HIV-infected pregnant woman . This study compare safety immune response PCV-13 PPV-23 vaccine HIV-infected pregnant woman . This study enroll HIV-infected pregnant woman second third trimester receive antiretroviral therapy . The study take place two step . In Step 1 , participant randomly assign receive PPV-23 vaccine , PCV-13 vaccine , placebo vaccine . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination , medical history nutritional status review , fetal heart rate measurement , blood collection , ultrasound , adherence questionnaire , nose throat swab procedure . They receive assign vaccine . Participants tell vaccine receiving . Participants remain clinic 30 60 minute receive vaccine monitoring . They attend study visit 14 21 day vaccination visit , Week 8 , time labor delivery . During visit , undergo select baseline study procedure . After delivery , participant ' baby physical examination blood collection . At 2 4 month delivery , participant ' baby undergo select baseline study procedure . Participants ' baby receive PCV vaccine accord local standard care . Step 2 study begin 6 month delivery , time participant baby attend study visit physical examination , medical history nutritional status review , adherence questionnaire , blood collection . Participants receive PPV-23 vaccine PCV-13 vaccine Step 1 end participation study visit . Participants receive placebo vaccine Step 1 randomly assign receive PPV-23 vaccine PCV-13 vaccine study visit tell vaccine receiving . Participants attend study visit 14 21 day receive vaccine , include select study procedure .</detailed_description>
