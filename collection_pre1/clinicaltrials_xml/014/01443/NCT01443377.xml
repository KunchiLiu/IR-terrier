	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy Combined With Panitumumab Locally Advanced KRAS Wild-type Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant progress management locally advanced rectal cancer achieve last decade . This include surgical technique widespread implementation total mesorectal excision well preoperative radiochemotherapy ( RCTX ) . The result recent randomized trial lead current standard ( radio- ) oncologist use continuous-infusion 5-FU concomitantly preoperative radiotherapy . It demonstrate provide improved tumor downstaging local control ; however , significant difference yet achieve 5-year disease-free overall survival rate . Thus , challenge integrate effective systemic therapy combined-modality program . The combination RCTX novel chemotherapeutic agent like oxaliplatin irinotecan phase I/II trial suggest high rate histopathological complete remission ( pCR ) compare 5-FU RCTX alone . However , due lack result randomize trial , date improvement long-term outcome could demonstrate , moreover , study increase pCR rate associate increase toxicity . Another strategy improve outcome incorporate newer , biologically active , targeted therapy establish RCTX regimen . Because key role signal proliferation , inhibition apoptosis angiogenesis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) promise target antitumor treatment . To date clinical phase I/II study preoperative RCTX initiated evaluate EGFR inhibitor radiosensitizer rectal cancer . These trial demonstrate combination cetuximab RCTX could safely apply without dose compromise respective treatment component . However , pCR rate could improve study . Given strong preclinical rationale combine EGFR inhibition RCTX rectal cancer patient , study aim investigate combination panitumumab 5-FU-based RCTX patient locally advanced KRAS wild-type rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
