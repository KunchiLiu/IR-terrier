	<brief_summary>Background : - Standard treatment hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) combination drug peg-IFN ribavirin . However , treatment effective people serious type HCV ( HCV genotype 1 ) also people human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) coinfection . Researchers want add new drug , boceprevir see improve treatment result people HCV genotype 1 HIV . Boceprevir use combination peg-IFN ribavirin recently approve treatment people HCV genotype 1 infection , currently study HIV HCV . Objectives : - To test boceprevir , peg-IFN , ribavirin treatment HCV genotype 1 people HCV monoinfection compare HIV HCV infection . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age HCV genotype 1 infection , receive interferon treatment HCV - Half study participant also HIV infection . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood urine test . - Participants also heart liver function test , answer question mood depression . - Those study receive ribavirin tablet take twice day , peg-IFN inject skin weekly . - Two week start treatment , participant blood test study treatment . - Four week start treatment , participant start take boceprevir three time day . - Participants regular study visit blood sample test . The length therapy depend level virus detect blood several clinic visit . Those respond well medicine 12 week stop treatment . The full length treatment 48 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boceprevir Drug Combination Hepatitis C Treatment People With Without HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major public health problem estimate 180 million people infected worldwide . In United States , estimate 4.1 million people infected HCV principal cause death liver disease lead indication liver transplantation . A combination ribavirin ( RBV ) pegylated interferon ( peg-IFN ) currently recommend therapy chronic HCV infection . However , therapy achieve viral clearance 19 % 52 % patient infected HCV genotype 1 76 % 80 % patient infected genotype 2 3 . Current therapy also associate high incidence adverse event low cure rate several population . Novel therapy rely interferon backbone require enhance cure rate various population . Recent data show add HCV serine protease inhibitor ( boceprevir [ BOC ] ) peg-IFN RBV result HCV eradication rate 70 % 80 % among HCV-monoinfected subject . However , whether human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected subject similar rate response triple combination therapy presently know . Previous data suggest HIV-infected patient chronic HCV infection much low eradication rate peg-IFN RBV HCV-monoinfected subject . This study explore whether HIV/HCV-coinfected subject low response rate BOC/peg-IFN/RBV regimen HCV-monoinfected subject . Participants chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 monoinfection ( N=50 ) coinfection HIV-1 ( N=50 ) , na ( SqrRoot ) IFN-based HCV treatment , receive combination therapy BOC ( 800 mg three time day , every 7 9 hour , food ) , weekly peg-IFN alpha-2b ( 1.5 mcg/kg/week ) twice daily RBV ( weight base ) maximum 44 week , 4-week lead-in peg-IFN RBV . BOC receive recent FDA approval treat HCV monoinfection combination peg-IFN RBV , approve labeling follow study . The primary endpoint comparative efficacy HCV-monoinfected HIV/HCV-coinfected subject . Secondary endpoint include determination host predictor therapeutic response , emergence resistance biomarkers , early viral kinetics . The finding study aid understand whether HIV infection affect HCV antiviral host response combination therapy use BOC/peg-IFN alfa-2b/RBV .</detailed_description>
