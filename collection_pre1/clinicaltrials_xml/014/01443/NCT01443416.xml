	<brief_summary>This study evaluate alternative booster pneumococcal conjugate vaccination ( PCV ) child 12 month age . Currently UK , 3 dos vaccine call Prevenar 13 ( PCV-13 ) , contain 13 pneumococcal serotypes attach carrier protein call CRM197 , give child 2 , 4 12 month age . There evidence vaccine call Synflorix ( PHiD-CV ) may least good currently use vaccine use alternative vaccine 12 month age . Although PHiD-CV contain 10 serotypes , evidence generates cross-reactive antibody two three additional serotypes include PCV-13 might enough protect child disease cause two serotypes . Furthermore , previous study show PHiD-CV confers protection common otitis medium pathogen child call nontypeable H. influenzae ( NTHi ) attachment carrier protein call Protein D , derive NTHi . In addition , use carrier protein , closely related antigen include coadministered previously administer routine vaccine minimises risk interference relate . The investigator aim recruit 168 healthy child age 12 month already receive two dos PCV-13 accord UK routine immunisation schedule 2 4 month age . Participants randomise receive booster dose either PCV-13 PHiD-CV 12 month age . Three visit take place parent ' home involve blood test follow dose PCV-13 PHiD-CV visit 1 , blood test visit 2 ( 1 month visit 1 ) 3 ( 1 year visit 1 ) .</brief_summary>
