	<brief_summary>Background : - The risk become addict drug varies person person , even among use similar drug similar way . Studies suggest certain personality trait see people drug addiction may present drug use . These trait include respond differently reward impulsivity . Early use drug ( age 15 ) also associate strongly drug addiction later life . Researchers want study teenager without certain behavioral problem , include use drug . This may help good understand behavior might predict future drug addiction . Objectives : - To understand brain function teenager may high risk others drug addiction . Eligibility : - Teenagers 13 17 year age fit one four group : - Have never rarely use drug - Have never rarely used drug conduct behavior disorder - Have use drug many occasion - Have use drug many occasion conduct behavior disorder Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical neurological exam . They also blood urine test . Participants answer question past drug use current medication . They also breathalyzer carbon monoxide breath test check recent drug alcohol use . - This study require four visit clinical center magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan test . - The first study visit include train MRI scan . Participants practice task front computer mock ( fake ) MRI machine . Participants also ask several question personality past experience . - Researchers test change tryptophan dopamine level . Both chemical affect decision making brain function . On three study visit , participant follow test randomly select order . One study do visit . - MRI scan change dopamine tryptophan level - MRI scan change dopamine ( placebo ) - MRI scan change tryptophan ( placebo ) - Participants monitor frequent blood draw test study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Even similar drug use pattern , risk drug addiction varies individual individual . However , neurobiological mechanism underlie variability poorly understood characterize . Studies suggest certain trait observe substance dependent individual may actually precede drug use , could augur future substance dependence . Understanding presence trait increase vulnerability substance addiction could aid development early intervention , preventative measure , well well treatment strategy . Objective : The primary goal protocol improve understanding increased susceptibility develop substance addiction . We focus reward punishment learning , impulse control , emphasis underlying role dopamine serotonin function two cognitive function . Further , give cortical plasticity enhance childhood adolescence , begin address whether early exposure substance enhance neurobiological change make individual vulnerable subsequent substance addiction . Subject Population : We focus adolescent ( 13-17 year old ) know increased vulnerability substance addiction individual early exposure substance , i.e . , use drug multiple occasion age 15 , diagnose conduct disorder yet substance dependent , along match control . Experimental Design : This study involve cognitive , pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) test mixed , within/between-subject design . Based upon power analysis , estimate need 30 participant 4 group early exposure ( EE ) , conduct disorder ( CD-NE ) , conduct disorder early exposure ( CD-EE ) , control early exposure ( NE ) complete experiment . This within subject , placebo control , crossover design participant test 1 ) cabergoline ( D2 receptor agonist ) treatment , 2 ) acute tryptophan depletion , 3 ) placebo . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure BOLD fMRI activation behavioral performance various cognitive task deal impulse control reward learn three treatment list . Secondary outcome measure include gene x environment interaction stress novelty-seeking measure .</detailed_description>
