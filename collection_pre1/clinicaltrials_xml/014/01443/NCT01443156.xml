	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND . Sleep deficiency ( get enough sleep ) widespread American adult lead many harmful health outcome high risk obesity , heart disease , diabetes . Sleep deficiency also harm cognitive performance , refer one 's awareness thinking ability . Sleep deficiency sleep-related health issue high interest among irregular and/or extend work schedule , schedule interfere normal biological rhythm sleepiness wakefulness . PURPOSE . This study examine health cognitive effect work schedule sleep pattern caregiver ( nurse , laboratory technician , non-clinical hospital staff ) . The investigator hypothesize nontraditional , irregular , extended work hour common profession adverse health cognitive effect . The purpose protocol : - Enroll caregiver one year cohort study relationship among work schedule , sleep , diet , chronic disease , cognitive performance . ( A cohort study follow group participant time see different behavior risk factor affect health . ) - Collect data caregiver work schedule , sleep , diet , chronic disease , cognitive performance . - Give personalized information feedback caregiver health factor . - Educate caregiver healthy diet exercise choice . - Collect saliva caregiver future research role gene health . ( Specimen collection genetic testing offer separate option study participant . ) RECRUITMENT . This study use Let 's Get Healthy ! health research education program ( OHSU IRB # 3694 ) platform recruitment data collection . Caregivers invite participate Let 's Get Healthy ! event give information prior event cohort study . At Let 's Get Healthy ! event , caregiver first consent anonymous research study ( OHSU IRB # 3694 ) , demographic health screen data link random number . Caregivers option consent cohort study , data longer anonymous instead link participant ' name contact information . PROCEDURES . This cohort study piggyback procedure already approve Let 's Get Healthy ! program ( OHSU IRB # 3694 ) . Let 's Get Healthy ! study participant provide anonymous data health fair follow manner : short computer survey cancer awareness , risk factor , family history ( immediate feedback give cancer risk prevention ) ; short computer survey diet sleep pattern ( immediate print feedback give ) ; health screening measurement ( blood pressure , height , weight , waist circumference , body mass index , body fat percentage ) ; finger stick ass sugar fat level blood ; mouthwash swish provide saliva specimen . However , cohort study ( OHSU IRB # 7542 ) make follow change addition : - Personal health data , instead anonymous , link participant ' name contact information ( follow-up data collection ) . - Let 's Get Healthy ! event include cognitive performance test , preventative-care survey , work schedule survey . - Participants provide data initial Let 's Get Healthy ! event , also follow-up event time period event . Between event , participant survey work schedule , diet , sleep , complete cognitive performance test . - There separate consent process participant provide fully identifiable saliva specimen . DATA ANALYSIS . Participants ' health data fully identifiable time data collection cod store physically separate location identifiable information . The link identifiable information cod health information store password protect computer , identifiable information delete upon completion data analysis . Data analyze explore relationship among work schedule , sleep , diet , body composition , metabolic health , chronic disease , cognitive performance caregiver . Genetic relationship factor analyze provided saliva specimen entry visit data collection .</brief_summary>
