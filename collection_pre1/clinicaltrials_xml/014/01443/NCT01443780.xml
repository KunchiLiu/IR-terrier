	<brief_title>Intervention With Selenium Q10 Cardiovascular Mortality Cardiac Function Elderly Population Sweden</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount patient suffer heart failure increase throughout Western hemisphere . The prognosis heart failure poor , many case worse malignant disease . Several study demonstrate evaluate plasma concentration natriuretic peptide stimulate increase wall tension myocardium , possible estimate risk cardiovascular mortality . Scientific report demonstrate decreased symptom heart failure selenium supplementation . Selenium , acquire body food , often exist low level body northern part Europe due poor level selenium soil . Animal study show selenium positive effect myocardium . Ubiquinon , commonly call Q10 , central position many enzyme system body . It recently show body require presence Q10 produce selenium contain enzymes central energy handling process cell . The aim present study evaluate whether supplementation selenium combine Q10 influence heart failure cardiovascular mortality elderly population . In 1998 people age 70-80 year live Kinda municipality Sweden offer chance participate epidemiological study emphasis heart failure . Of 1130 people live municipality specify age group , 871 agree participate study . Participants question regard new patient record , examine , new echocardiogram perform , blood sample draw health relate quality life evaluate . These participant also offer chance participate follow-up epidemiological study . In addition , offer chance participate present intervention study give dietary supplement 200 microgram selenium/day 200 milligram Q10/day , placebo . No serious side effect supplement observe early study use dos plan intervention study . The dietary supplement sell without restriction counter product . During study participant followed-up blood sample , new patient record , new tablet every six month . Evaluation health relate quality life perform inclusion , 18 month 48 month . The quality life evaluate use validated instrument SF-36 . At end study , new blood sample new echocardiogram obtain . Aim To evaluate change primarily cardiovascular mortality all-cause mortality , secondary , cardiac function evaluate cardiac natriuretic peptide echocardiography dietary supplementation selenium Q10 , placebo , elderly population 48 month intervention . Secondary objective To evaluate cost-effectiveness selenium Q10 combine intervention 48 month . To measure perceive health relate quality life intervention . Possible health related economic consequence evaluate use instrument EQ-5D . Endpoint Development cardiovascular disease , worsen exist cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular mortality intervention selenium Q10 comparison placebo . Change concentration natriuretic peptide intervention selenium Q10 . Secondary endpoint Development all-cause mortality intervention selenium Q10 . Consumption hospital resource intervention selenium Q10 relation placebo . Study design A prospective randomize double-blind placebo control study . Randomising The randomising procedure perform use PharmaNord 's computer assist randomization block 6 . Study All participant offer selenium-containing yeast preparation correspond 200 microgram selenium/day , ubiquinone correspond 200 milligrams/day , placebo . During intervention period , blood sample draw every six month participant , follow list substance analyze : 1 . NT-proBNP 2 . Thioredoxin 3 . Thioredoxinreductase 4 . Lipidperoxidase 5 . Panel cytokines 6 . `` New '' biomarkers heart failure . All blood sample result blind investigator participant . Inclusion criterion Individuals live municipality Kinda , age 70-80 year accept participation study , expect fulfill study period 4 year . Exclusion criterion Recent myocardial infarction ( within 4 week ) . Planned cardio-vascular operative procedure within 4 week . Hesitation concern candidate decide him/herself whether participate study , he/she understands consequence participation . Serious disease substantially reduce survival expect participant cooperate full 4 year period . Other factor make participation unreasonable , long/complicated transport Primary Health Center project manage , drug/alcohol abuse . Preparations Coenzyme Q10 ( Bio-Quinon 200mg , PharmaNord , Vejle , Denmark ) Selenium ( SelenoPrecise 200 microgram , PharmaNord , Vejle , Denmark ) Placebo ( PharmaNord , Vejle , Denmark ) All preparation ingest twice day together food . The preparation supply PharmaNord , Vejle , Denmark . The preparation store lock , dry , dark room personnel involve study access . A rigorous log regard receive delivered preparation keep . Concomitant pharmacological treatment Participants prescribe pharmacological drug due concomitant diseases/medical condition advise continue treatment . Participants prescribe anticoagulant contain warfarin advise continue treatment , recommend analyze INR start intervention selenium Q10 , 2 week . Interactions selenium/Q10 warfarin discuss literature demonstrate . Where code list ? The code list contain information active treatment/placebo keep seal envelope PharmaNord , Vejle , Denmark , cod broken end study , case emergency information regard intervention require . Side effect Serious side effect report National Board Health Welfare PharmaNord . Dropouts Participants choose discontinue study reason follow accord intention treat principle . All dropout register , well reason discontinue participation , participant choose supply information . Participants take supplement selenium Q10 reason outside study regard dropout . Ethical permission Ethical permission shall accept Ethical Review Board start study . Oral write `` patient '' information give participant , well sign copy consent form . Permission Swedish Medical Products Agency Contact take Medical Products Agency Sweden regard permission use preparation intervention . However , principal investigator project orally inform Agency since regard trial medication , rather food supplement commodity readily available commercial good , Agency would review study protocol . Participants 500-600 healthy individual well patient treat various disease already participate former epidemiological heart failure study Kinda municipality . Basic power calculation Using assumption incidence occurrence placebo group follow 4 year 40 % , 28 % intervention group , i.e . difference incidence group 30 % absolute difference 12 % , 244 individual need order obtain statistical power 80 % significance level 5 % . A dropout frequency 15 % expect , minimum 560 individual need order obtain significant difference .
