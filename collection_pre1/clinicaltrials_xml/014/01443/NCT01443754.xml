	<brief_summary>The present study design prospective , single centre , open label , observational trial . The study collect information medical care patient receive plan procedure ( ) . No new testing procedure do . Patients elect hybrid revascularization ask write consent use personal data . Left internal mammary artery Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery ( LIMA-LAD ) surgical revascularization perform first , follow percutaneous revascularization vessel frame hospitalization . After discharge patient attend clinic visit 30 day 12 month , per usual clinical practice , contact phone 6 month procedure . Angiographic follow-up perform symptomatic patient , clinically indicate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Revascularisation Combined Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) PCI Multivessel Coronary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hybrid coronary revascularization integrates positive feature Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) , combine durability Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery ( LIMA ) coronary bypass minimal invasiveness low risk percutaneous intervention . Thereby might represent good option sizeable proportion patient . Candidate patient hybrid revascularization would advantageous several subgroup Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) patient increase number : elderly patient high risk mortality and/or morbidity CABG , patient significant disability patient treatment durability important significantly invasive approach option . There several potential advantage hybrid procedure conventional CABG select patient . These advantage include avoidance cardiopulmonary bypass-related morbidity , aortic manipulation LIMA-LAD beat heart procedure , less blood loss decrease transfusion , short recovery time conventional CABG patient 's preference `` minimally invasive '' surgery . The investigator hypothesize select patient diffuse coronary disease , `` hybrid '' approach employ stag revascularisation procedure may allow low surgical risk , increase completeness effectiveness revascularisation , hopefully , improve immediate long term outcome . To test hypothesis , well design , properly size , prospective , randomize study need . Available data , however , provide sufficient information speculate clinically meaningful , yet achievable , effectiveness . Aim observational study therefore collect information target population , clinical outcome optimal management order inform design comparative effectiveness trial .</detailed_description>
