	<brief_summary>The purpose study test prevention strategy pregnancy-related malaria . Researchers compare different malaria treatment treatment schedule include chloroquine therapy ( weekly dos versus dose twice pregnancy 3 day time ) standard practice preventive treatment interval pregnancy ( drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine give twice pregnancy ) . Participants include 900 pregnant woman , assign one three treatment group . Blood sample collect every visit birth time participant ill determine malaria present . Pregnant woman monitor pregnancy newborn assess birth follow 14 week . Participant involvement study expect last 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In area high malaria endemicity , typical much sub-Saharan Africa , despite achieve semi-immunity malaria adulthood , woman become vulnerable malaria infection pregnancy , especially first second pregnancy . They increase rate infection peripheral blood high concentration parasite find placenta . On histological examination , mature asexual parasite , form usually detect peripheral blood , accumulate placenta . Pregnancy-specific variant surface antigens responsible increased vulnerability pregnant woman malaria unrecognized immune system woman encounter first time first pregnancy . In subsequent pregnancy , woman develop immunity parasite surface antigens parasite clear host response . Plasmodium ( P ) falciparum infection pregnancy important health consequence pregnant woman newborn . Adverse outcomes pregnancy-associated malaria document Malawi include maternal anemia , low birth weight ( LBW ) , increase infant mortality . The primary objective study compare weekly chloroquine prophylaxis chloroquine intermittent preventative therapy ( IPT ) malaria pregnancy ( IPTp ) standard practice [ IPTp sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) ] respect prevention placental malaria . The secondary objective : compare weekly chloroquine prophylaxis chloroquine IPTp standard practice ( IPTp SP ) respect prevention malaria pregnancy ; compare weekly chloroquine prophylaxis chloroquine IPTp standard practice ( IPTp SP ) respect prevention adverse maternal newborn effect pregnancy-associated malaria . The exploratory objective identify vulnerable period pregnancy malaria infection likely cause placental infection , maternal anemia , low infant birth weight . This randomize controlled trial compare chloroquine IPT chloroquine chemoprophylaxis IPTp SP . Women randomize Screening enrollment , begin assign treatment Week 20 Week 28 gestation . Specimens collect every prenatal visit time participant ill determine malaria present . Pregnant woman monitor pregnancy , newborn assess birth follow approximately 14 week age . Participants randomize one follow regimen : Chloroquine approximately 1,500 mg base 3 day , twice pregnancy ( 2 tablet Day 0 , 2 tablet Day 1 , 1 tablet Day 2 ) ; Chloroquine base 600 mg ( 2 tablet ) load dose follow 300 mg ( 1 tablet ) orally per week delivery ; SP 1500 mg/75 mg twice pregnancy .</detailed_description>
