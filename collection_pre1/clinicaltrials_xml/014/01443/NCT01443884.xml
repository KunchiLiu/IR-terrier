	<detailed_description>Obese individual high risk development hypertension cardiovascular disease . Adipose tissue major source pro-inflammatory molecule promote development atherosclerosis . Development atherosclerotic plaque mediate oxidized otherwise modify LDL cholesterol infiltration activate immune cell atherosclerotic lesion . Grapes contain high level polyphenols , class compound know possess antioxidant anti-inflammatory property . The overall goal proposal determine whether grape consumption reduce risk cardiovascular disease reduce presence inflammatory molecule positively alter cholesterol level , lipid profile , immune cell response . Using randomized cross-over design , twenty obese subject consume beverage contain either four serving grape powder per day caloric equivalent without grape powder ( placebo control ) total three week . After two week washout period , beverage switch three week . Blood take person six interval determine lipid profile , measure inflammatory marker plasma , analyze immune cell responsiveness .</detailed_description>
