	<brief_summary>The activity drug-metabolizing enzyme transporter evolutes Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass . Primary aim : To study intra individual evolution phenotypical marker different drug metabolize enzyme one transporter ( CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A4 P-gp ) , use cocktail phenotypic approach , Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenotypical Approach Drug Metabolizing Hormones Activity Before After Roux-en Y-Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Principal Judgement criterion : Phenotypical marker enzymes transporter activity , 5-8 week 25-30 week follow surgery . Secondary judgement criterion : - Genetic polymorphism know affect expression and/or activity enzymes transporter . - Intestinal hepatic expression activity enzymes transporter interest . - Markers inflammation Methodology , study design : open-labelled monocentric study . Sample size : It descriptive experimental study involve 12 subject . Study design : In centre 1 : Inclusion least 2 week prior surgery ( V0 ) In centre 2 : Three study 12 hour occur ( addition usual clinical surgical follow ) three time period : 8 week period surgery ( V1 ) , 5-8 week surgery ( V2 ) 25-30 week surgery ( V3 ) . In centre 3 : patient undergo gastric bypass surgery ( correspond usual clinical surgical follow ) sample jejunum liver obtain surgery ( J0 ) . Centres 4 5 involved sample analysis.Hence , patient attend 3 visit , addition usual clinical surgical follow-up . Study duration : 26 month ( duration inclusion 18 month ) Duration patient : 38 week maximum ( 8 month ) Investigating center participate unit : one center enrol patient three center involve others investigation .</detailed_description>
