	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pro-oxidant toxicity iron injection critically ill patient healthy volunteer . The investigator hypothesize inflammatory state critically ill patient reduce oxydative stress induce iron injection , compare one induce healthy volunteer . It open `` proof-of-concept '' study aim evaluate iron toxicity critically ill patient ( n=40 ) compare healthy volunteer ( n=40 ) . The investigator compare oxidative stress ( principal judgment criteria= 8-iso-PGF2α ) follow 100 mg injection iron ( T0 , T2 , T6 T24 hour post injection ) group investigator compare effect repeat injection critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Oxidative Stress Induced Iron Injection Healthy Volunteers Critical Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia frequent among critically ill patient , 60 % patient anemic admission 80 % discharge . This anemia associate increase MORBI-mORTALITY . However , therapeutic option , mainly transfusion erythropoietin , disappoint . There remain therapeutic option , iron injection , fully evaluate potential restriction : inflammation may prevent efficacy , iron could toxic , notably generation oxidative stress . Our research aim explore benefit iron treatment critical care anemia . The investigator already demonstrate MURIN model critical care anemia master regulator iron metabolism , hepcidin , repress iron mobilize store despite inflammation . In addition , observational human study , investigator report 25 % critically ill patient iron deficiency low normal hepcidin level . All together , data indicate iron therapy may beneficial situation . In present study , investigator evaluate toxicity iron context critical care anemia . Iron , especially non-transferrin bound iron , know induce generation oxygen-derived free radical Fenton reaction . However , generation oxidative stress secondary iron injection investigate critically ill . In animal model , preliminary data indicate production oxidative stress serum follow iron injection may prevent inflammation . Objectives : To evaluate pro-oxidant toxicity iron injection critically ill patient healthy volunteer . The investigator hypothesize oxidative stress reduce critically ill compare healthy volunteer Human study : It open `` proof-of-concept '' study aim evaluate iron toxicity critically ill patient ( n=40 ) compare healthy volunteer ( n=40 ) . The investigator compare oxidative stress ( principal judgment criteria= 8-iso-PGF2α ) follow 100 mg injection iron ( T0 , T2 , T6 T24 hour post injection ) group investigator compare effect repeat injection critically ill patient . Perspectives : This study confirm iron produce oxidant stress critically ill patient healthy volunteer . The animal study help precise efficacy treatment , addition toxicity . All result help design phase III randomize study intravenous iron critically ill anemic patient</detailed_description>
