	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response H5N1 Influenza Vaccine People Who Have Previously Received H5N1 H7N3 Influenza Vaccine People Who Have Never Received Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Avian influenza virus , include H1N1 H5N1 , capable cause influenza pandemic . The 2009 H1N1 pandemic cause approximately 10,000 death United States , H1N1 H5N1 influenza outbreak observe country around world . Previous study show people receive H5N1 vaccine receive another H5N1 vaccine year later great antibody response people receive single vaccination . This study evaluate safety immune response inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy adult previously receive two dos H5N1 VN 04 ca vaccine H5N1 HK 03 ca vaccine previously receive two dos H7N3 ca vaccine , another avian influenza vaccine . The study also enroll people previously receive LAIV . Participants previously receive H5N1 H7N3 vaccine receive one injection H5N1 vaccine baseline . Participants receive previous LAIV randomly assign receive either one dose two dos H5N1 vaccine . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , vital sign measurement , pregnancy test female . All participant receive one injection vaccine upper arm . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic 30 minute observation monitoring . All participant attend additional study visit Days 3 7 . Participants assign receive one vaccination also attend study visit Days 28 , 56 , 180 . Participants assign receive two vaccination attend study visit Days 28 ( time receive second vaccination ) , 35 , 56 , 84 , 208 .
