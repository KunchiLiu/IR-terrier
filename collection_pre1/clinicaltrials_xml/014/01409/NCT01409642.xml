Thus , still much do way optimize treatment outcome pediatric OCD . Increasingly , effort improve exist treatment focus aspect family environment may affect treatment adherence maintenance therapeutic gain . Such work suggest parental accommodation criticism common characteristic home environment adult child OCD ( Calvocoressi et al. , 1999 ; Peris , Roblek , Langley , Chang , McCracken , &amp; Piacentini , 2008 ; Van Noppen et al. , 1991 ) , adult sample , family feature associate poor treatment outcome great risk relapse ( Amir , Freshman , &amp; Foa , 2000 ; Chambless &amp; Steketee , 1999 ; Leonard et al. , 1993 ) .

The goal study investigate manualized P-FIT program youth OCD first small open trial ten family investigate feasibility tolerability treatment randomize trial ( main study ) ass incremental efficacy usual care ( i.e. , individual cognitive behavioral therapy ) . For initial pilot stage , four child age 9-17 treated P-FIT UCLA Child OCD , Anxiety , Tic Disorders Program complete diagnostic evaluation confirm eligibility . During pilot study , procedure material manual refine finalize control trial . The treatment consist 12 session standard cognitive behavioral therapy augment novel 6-session family focus treatment module . Assessments involve interview , questionnaire , several short task conduct begin , midpoint end treatment . We also follow family 3 month follow treatment order assess durability treatment gain . Study staff meet weekly discus open trial therapy session , include feasibility , efficacy , acceptability treatment manual , make adjustment need . Once group reach consensus regard suitability manual , recruitment open trial end subsequent eligible family invite participate randomize control trial ( main study ) . Over course main study , 40 youngster randomize receive either individual child-centered cognitive behavioral therapy ( ICBT ) P-FIT intervention ( ICBT + 6 session family treatment ) . All subject regardless response status evaluate schedule assessment point . In addition comprehensive parent , child , clinician report , primary outcome variable assess blind independent evaluator . Manualized intervention assessment protocols plus state-of-the art quality assurance ( i.e. , weekly supervision expert clinician specialize specifically OCD treatment ) adverse event monitoring procedure insure participant safety . Results investigation use support large control comparative trial compare degree P-FIT improves outcomes youth OCD beyond current available treatment .</detailed_description>
