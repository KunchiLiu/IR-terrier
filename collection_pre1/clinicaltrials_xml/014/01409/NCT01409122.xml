	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) increase blood pressure ( BP ) small pulmonary vessel , artery , vein capillary result progressive increase right ventricular afterload , often lead right ventricular failure death . Pulmonary hypertension result multitude pathology , include arterial etiology , venous , chronic hypoxia relate , thromboembolic , miscellaneous etiology . In recent Dana Point Classification , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) classify Group 1 . In Group 1 PAH , pathologic lesion localize small muscular pulmonary artery , result luminal narrowing resistance blood flow . Group 1 PAH include idiopathic sporadic PAH heritable PAH include family history PAH . Associated PAH include disease associate connective tissue disease well PAH associate congenital systemic pulmonary shunt , portal hypertension , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Drug toxin induce PAH also Group 1 . Untreated , patient PAH average life expectancy 3 year , decline approximately 1 year right heart failure present . Inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) potent acute vasodilator . Its acute administration result improve hemodynamics 10 15 % patient PAH demonstrate acute vasoreactivity . However , usefulness NO chronic therapy limit need continuous inhalation . In patient demonstrate vasoreactivity acute challenge inhale NO prostanoid challenge , therapy calcium channel blocker demonstrate result improve symptom survival . In patient demonstrate acute vasodilator response , available therapy PAH include prostanoids , endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor . However , route frequency administration prostanoids , hepatotoxicity ERAs , concern sustain efficacy ERAs PDE-5 inhibitor suggest many patient PAH could benefit effective therapy offer ease administration favorable toxicity profile . Aires Pharmaceuticals , Inc. develop novel therapeutic , AIR001 , treatment PAH . The active ingredient AIR001 sodium nitrite , formulate buffer , pH-adjusted solution nebulization . Preclinical data suggest hypoxic , acidotic condition present pulmonary hypertensive lung , inhale sodium nitrite serf sustain release source NO act acute pulmonary vasodilator . In addition , decrease level NO show stimulate vascular remodeling , increase NO result nitrite inhalation postulate attenuate reverse pulmonary arterial remodel process , result symptomatic improvement pulmonary hemodynamic improvement patient PAH . Preclinical experiment show AIR001 oral , IV , inhalation route administration effective treat PAH induce hypoxia monocrotaline administer infrequently weekly dos generate plasma concentration approximately 1 10 uM . While precise mechanism AIR001 exert anti-hypertensive action PAH model remain elucidated , nitrite demonstrate metabolized NO animal human . Single dose AIR001 show well tolerated human dose level generate peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) target range establish preclinical model safety issue identify . AIR001 reduce PH induce hypoxic gas inhalation healthy volunteer dose well tolerate . Preclinical clinical data support clinical investigation inhale AIR001 treatment PAH . Before progress study patient PAH , safety tolerability multiple dose administration AIR001 evaluate Part A current study . The PDE-5 inhibitor , sildenafil , approve use patient PAH commonly use initial treatment PAH . AIR001 convert NO , increase cGMP dependent vasodilatation . Because PDE-5 inhibitor prevent catabolism cGMP phosphodiesterase , possible exaggerated drug effect could observe AIR001 administered patient treat sildenafil . Therefore , combination safety tolerability ( particular orthostatic effect ) escalate single dos AIR001 also evaluate combination steady-state sildenafil Part B study . A cohort patient previously diagnose PAH stable background therapy assess safety tolerability multiple dos AIR001 Part C study . Part D study ass PK , safety tolerability single dose AIR001 three different nebulizer randomize crossover design .</detailed_description>
