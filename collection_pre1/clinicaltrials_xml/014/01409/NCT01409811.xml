	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study biomarkers tissue sample patient newly diagnose breast cancer treat zoledronic acid ( ZA ) . Studying sample tumor tissue laboratory patient receive ZA may help doctor learn effect ZA cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Patients With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Treated With Zoledronic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 14 tumor biomarkers growth metastasis ( 10 microarray 4 RT-PCR ) change response ZA . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 30 measure immunologic function ( Luminex panel ) change response ZA ) 48-72 hour b ) 10-14 day . II . To explore additional tumor biomarkers ( approximately 20 immunohistochemistry ) change response ZA . OUTLINE : Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute day 1 . Patients undergo plan definitive surgery ( lumpectomy mastectomy ) day 10-14 . Tissue blood sample initial biopsy definitive surgery collect measure change biomarkers tumor growth metastasis , immunologic function , expression gene important breast cancer progression metastasis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 40-44 day .</detailed_description>
