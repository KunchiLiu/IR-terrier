	<brief_summary>Vitamin D exert antiproliferative differentiate effect cancer , include non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The active form Vitamin D 1,25 , dihydroxycholecalciferol ( calcitriol ) rapidly induce expression cytochrome P450 24R-hydroxylase ( CYP24A1 ) . CYP24A1 initiate inactivation calcitriol result successive hydroxylation/oxidation reaction . This study seek prospectively determine relationship Vitamin D gene expression median survival primary outcome , Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) /CYP24A1 gene expression cancer stage , smoke status , serum 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 level well CYP24A1 genotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek prospectively determine relationship Vitamin D gene expression median survival primary outcome , relationship Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) /CYP24A1 gene expression cancer stage , smoke status , serum 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 level well CYP24A1 genotype . Patients suspect lung cancer recruit study prior diagnostic biopsy . Those consented study give permission blood tissue biopsy analyze study endpoint . Statistical analysis data seek correlate CYP24A1 expression medican survival participant . Patients ' data collect smoking status cancer stage . Study enrollment adequately power study statistically 80 patient . Anticipated study duration 12 month 18 month sample collection two year follow-up patient survival .</detailed_description>
