	<brief_summary>Overweight/obesity increase general population patient cirrhosis . In compensated patient cirrhosis increase BMI risk factor clinical decompensation independent liver function portal pressure . Nonetheless , patient cirrhosis obesity show progressive increase portal pressure , might explain increased risk complication . Since obesity potentially modifiable risk factor , design proof-of-concept study assess effect weight loss ( obtain 4 month diet exercise ) portal pressure patient compensate cirrhosis overweight/obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Weight Loss Portal Pressure Patients With Overweight/Obesity Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity markedly increase risk appearance progression chronic disease , include chronic liver disease . In general population obesity constantly dramatically raise , represent global epidemic . In study include European American patient , group report patient compensated cirrhosis overweight/obesity frequently observe ( 55 % OW , 15 % OB Spanish patient ; &gt; 50 % OB USA patient ) , figure similar general population . Moreover , study demonstrate increase body mass index ( BMI ) risk factor development decompensation cirrhosis , independent portal pressure liver function ( Berzigotti et al . Hepatology 2011 ) . We also observe included patient cirrhosis obesity show significant increase portal pressure ( estimate hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement-HVPG ) , find OW normal weight patient . This suggest mechanism induce decompensation obese patient cirrhosis might mediate increase portal pressure , even data available population support hypothesis . It well know obesity adipose tissue acquire pro-inflammatory phenotype lead increased release IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-alfa many pro-fibrogenic cytokine hormone , might mediate also increase portal pressure . Given observation , give potential reversibility OW/OB , hypothesise weight loss ( obtain diet exercise ) might effectively reduce HVPG patient compensate cirrhosis OW/OB , reduce risk progression . We design proof-of-concept study confirm hypothesis .</detailed_description>
