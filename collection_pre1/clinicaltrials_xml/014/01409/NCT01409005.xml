	<brief_summary>Although remarkable advance treatment metastatic recurrent colorectal cancer ( MRCRC ) , long term survival expect patient MRCRC inevitably develop resistance chemotherapeutic drug except MRCRC patient undergo complete resection ( metastasectomy ) . Until , approve cytotoxic drug treatment MCRC 3 category ( fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin irinotecan ) . Recently , molecularly target drug approve MRCRC patient , bevacizumab cetuximab ( K-ras wild type tumor ) available . When cytotoxic target drug appropriately combine , 24 month overall survival ( OS ) expect patient MRCRC . However , drug use patient afford receive expensive target drug economical problem , option chemotherapy best supportive care option , although patient still good performance status medical condition . Therefore , unmet need additional salvage chemotherapy regimens patient oxaliplatin , irinotecan fluoropyrimidine-refractory MRCRC . In previous study , gemcitabine-based chemotherapy show antitumor activity MRCRC patient . Especially , combined fluoropyrimidine , gemcitabine show exert synergic effect antitumor activity . On background , phase 2 clinical study design . In study , efficacy safety gemcitabine plus UFTE chemotherapy evaluate MRCRC patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age : ≥ 18 year old ECOG performance status : 0 2 Pathologically proven adenocarcinoma colorectum Patients receive cytotoxic drug 3 category ( fluoropyrimidine [ 5FU , capecitabine S1 etc . ] , oxaliplatin irinotecan ) . Refractory MRCRC progress receiving , within 6 month discontinuation fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin irinotecan . When retry fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin irinotecan possible due previous severe toxicity despite progressionfree interval ≥ 6 month , patient enrol study . Patients previously treat cetuximab cetuximab use ( i.e . Kras mutant economical problem ) At least one measurable lesion exist ( RECIST version 1.1 ) Patients previously receive fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin irinotecan exclude . Patients receive UFTE chemotherapy previously . However , UFTE chemotherapy use adjuvant chemotherapy diseasefree interval great 6 month , patient include study . Patients receive active passive immunotherapy Patients complete bowel obstruction progressive symptom partial bowel obstruction interfere adequate oral diet . Patients large amount ascites require frequent therapeutic paracentesis ( &gt; per week ) Pregnant breastfeed woman ( pregnancy test must perform female patient childbearing potential entering study ) Women childbearing potential unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period . Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control study partner woman childbearing potential Serious concurrent infection nonmalignant illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize complication study therapy ( i.e. , uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled epilepsy , cerebrovascular accident within past 6 month , neurologic psychological disease interfere study treatment ) Inadequate cardiovascular function : New York Heart Association class III IV heart disease , Unstable angina myocardial infarction within past 6 month , Symptomatic coronary artery disease History significant ventricular arrhythmia require medication antiarrhythmic significant conduction system abnormality Symptomatic severe interstitial lung disease pulmonary fibrosis Patients impaired renal function : Creatinine clearance &lt; 50mL/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault formula ) Patients laboratory result follow ; Number absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L Number thrombocyte &lt; 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ALAT , ASAT &gt; 3 x upper limit normal ( case liver metastasis , &gt; ALAT , ASAT &gt; 5 x upper limit normal ) Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 x upper limit normal ( case liver bone metastasis , &gt; 5 x upper limit normal ) Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery Patients include clinical trial within past 4 week .</criteria>
