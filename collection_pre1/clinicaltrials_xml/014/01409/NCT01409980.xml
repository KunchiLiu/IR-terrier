	<detailed_description>A triphalangeal thumb thumb three phalanx . The thumb often appear long fingerlike , sometimes plane finger . Anatomically , extra phalanx different shape . Several classification system use , simplest often use Wood ( 1976 ) classification shape extra phalanx . If extra phalanx triangularly shape classified type I . Type II rectangular shape extra phalanx develop full phalanx . Type III full extra phalanx . Different treatment strategy develop base type triphalangeal thumb . This project look specifically type I , delta phalanx . The goal surgery type reconstruct anatomic deformity stable , functional thumb provide acceptable appearance . There consensus triphalangeal thumb delta phalanx treat . Bunnell Campbell 1940s advocate surgery . Milch advocate excise abnormal phalanx pediatric population support non-operative treatment adult population . A potential unwanted result excision angulate joint . Buck-Gramcko propose excision delta phalanx combine ligament reconstruction could give good result excision alone . Hovius recommend different treatment base age presentation . For patient le 6 year , advocate excision transverse oval piece skin , resection extra phalanx reconstruction radial collateral ligament new IP joint , lengthen ulnar collateral ligament . For patient old 6 year , advocate partial resection extra phalanx correction angle arthrodesis DIP joint . Usually , collateral ligament reconstruction necessary case . Horii et al review 13 type I delta triphalangeal thumb associate hand abnormality . Surgical treatment patient consist excision accessory phalanx repair collateral ligament . The IP joint temporarily fix Kirschner wire 4-6 week . Mean follow-up 8.9 year . All patient satisfy improvement appearance . The mean IP joint motion 54 degree . No patient complain instability pain IP joint . Only one patient ten degrees lateral bend . They recommend operate patient age 1-2 year , phalangeal epiphysis become clear . They felt earlier excision allow well joint adaptation . The child also learn use hand correctly . Recently debate beneficial wait operate child old , bone joint mature . At point , osteotomy could perform . Although result publish yet , several well-respected hand surgeon conclude outcomes good patient delay surgery . In institution , child generally thumb reconstruct use delta phalanx excision repair ligament around 1 2 year .</detailed_description>
