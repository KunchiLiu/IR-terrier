	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I part clinical research study find high tolerable dose drug Yervoy ( ipilimumab ) give drug Intron-A ( interferon alfa-2b ) Proleukin ( aldesleukin , IL-2 ) patient metastatic melanoma . The safety combination also study Phase I . The goal Phase II learn combination help control metastatic melanoma . Ipilimumab , interferon alfa-2b , aldesleukin design block activity cell decrease immune system 's ability fight cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 64 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose ipilimumab receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ipilimumab . Each new group receive high dose ipilimumab group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ipilimumab find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive ipilimumab high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level interferon alfa-2b aldesleukin . Study Drug Administration : The study drug give 3 stage : induction , consolidation , maintenance . Induction : Induction last 12 week . You receive study drug four 3-week cycle : - You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 cycle . - You receive aldesleukin hospital vein continuous infusion Days 2-5 cycle . - You receive interferon alfa-2b injection skin Days 1-5 cycle . Consolidation : Consolidation last 12 week . You receive study drug four 3-week cycle : - You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 Cycle 1 . - You receive aldesleukin hospital vein continuous infusion Days 2-5 cycle . - You receive interferon alfa-2b injection skin Days 1-5 cycle . Maintenance : Maintenance last 1Â½ year . You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 six 12-week cycle . Other Drugs : You give drug help low risk side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Study Visits : Before cycle ( +/- 3 day ) : - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test test liver kidney function . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . At end cycle , physical exam , include measurement weight . Any tumor felt hand measure physical exam see change size . Every 2 cycle ( +/- 7 day ) , chest x-ray CT MRI scan check status disease . Anytime doctor think need , photo skin lesion take . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless lesion face . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 2 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 14 day stop study therapy , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , CT MRI scan . Every 2 month 3 year , also contact phone clinic visit see . This investigational study . Ipilimumab , interferon alfa-2b , aldesleukin FDA approve commercially available treat melanoma . Giving drug combination investigational . Up 88 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
