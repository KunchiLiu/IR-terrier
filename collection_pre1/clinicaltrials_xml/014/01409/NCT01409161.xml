	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) , gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( GO ) help control APL . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia ( APL ) Treated With ATRA , Arsenic Trioxide Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : ATRA ATO design cause APL cell mature function normally . ATO also kill leukemia cell directly . GO design attach CD33 , certain protein often find leukemia cell , cause die . Study Drug Administration : Induction : If find eligible take part study , begin Induction . This call Course 1 . During Induction , take ATRA mouth 2 time day , start Day 1 . You also receive ATO needle vein every day , start Day 1 . You continue receive drug bone marrow longer show APL cell . This call complete remission ( CR ) . Some time Weeks 1-4 , may give GO one time vein , 2 hour . You receive methylprednisolone mouth vein day 5 day help prevent side effect . If vein , infusion take 30 minute . If stop take either ATRA ATO side effect , may continue receive GO every 4 5 week complete remission 28 week . Consolidation : Within 1 week disease CR , consolidation treatment begin . You receive ATO vein 5 day total Weeks 1-4 Courses 2-5 . Each course 8 week . You take ATRA mouth twice day Weeks 1-2 5-6 Courses 2-5 . If study doctor think need , may receive GO vein 1 hour . You receive 2 dos 5 week apart . Your doctor may change dose schedule best interest . If study doctor agrees , may consolidation treatment give home doctor . Your home doctor contact research staff provide treatment detail . Your home doctor ask perform physical exam blood work his/her office , ask send laboratory report back research nurse . You ask return MD Anderson every 3 month follow-up visit . Study Visits : Before course treatment , physical exam . At visit , ask side effect may drug may take . On Days 1-7 Course 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Blood drawn 2 time week disease CR . If able become pregnant , blood ( Â½ teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test within 48 hour take first dose GO . To take part study , pregnant . You bone marrow aspirate collect Day 21-28 Course 1 check status disease . If doctor think need , may bone marrow aspirate collect every 7-10 day blood cell count return certain level . Once disease CR , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn receive every round ATO every round GO , least every week Weeks 1-4 Courses 2-5 . You ECG receive ATO Weeks 1-4 Courses 1-5 . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 4 consolidation course . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , respond study drug , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete long-term follow . End-of-Treatment Visit : You end treatment visit within 1 month ( +/- 1 week ) last dose study drug . The following procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Follow-up Visits : At 12 , 18 , 24 month last treatment : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . - You ask side effect may drug may take . Long-Term Follow-up Visits : You contact every 6-12 month telephone call , regular mail , e-mail check status disease . If contact phone , call last 10 minute . This investigational study . ATRA ATO FDA approve commercially available . GO FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research purpose . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
