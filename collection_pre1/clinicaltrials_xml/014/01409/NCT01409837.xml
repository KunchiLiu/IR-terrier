	<brief_summary>This study conceive order explain investigator previously observe suggest lisinopril , drug normally use treat patient high blood pressure heart failure , may effective treat infertile men low sperm count . The investigator hypothesize , therefore , drug improve sperm quantity quality also increase fertility patient . The investigator first review result previously publish investigation find previous study do humans.with class drug . Besides , method use conduct study fault result trust show true picture . The investigator look various fault point respect design conduct take care design investigator study . This attempt provide credible answer question whether lisinopril , possibly drug similar mode action , useful rectifying problem infertility cause low sperm count , , whether safe use people high blood pressure heart failure . In order achieve investigator study 33 patient sperm low cell concentration , low percentage motile cell high percentage abnormal cell know cause . The patient randomly allocate receive either lisinopril 2.5mg daily ( 17 patient ) daily placebo ( 16 patient ) sperm characteristic examined interval , start begin study end 282 week later . The patient also monitor adverse event throughout period . The data form patient take part random allocation treatment begin study include analysis follow , irrespective whether complete study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Safety Lisinopril Non-hypertensive Men With Infertility From Low Sperm Count</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Infertility constitute cause 16.6 % patient seek consultation primary healthcare level . Male factor infertility account 50 % infertility problem . Of percentage seminal fluid abnormality unknown cause common , occur 60 % male unexplained , type infertility . Although subject seminal fluid defect father child infertility long pose major therapeutic challenge . The rationale use various hormonal non-hormonal drug currently available , best , empirical efficacy trial conduct yielded conflicting result . Although assisted fertilization technique increase number therapeutic option available couple infertility problem still serious limitation access new technology , especially low-income country . Besides , additional concern regard possible untoward effect . These linger problem underscore need continue search effective treatment option cheaper accessible also less complicated non-invasive . The current study occasion previous , independent observation ( albeit fortuitous ) normalization seminal fluid parameter well spouse pregnancy two men long-standing , idiopathic azoospermia . The common factor two men treatment low-dose ( 2.5mg per day ) Lisinopril , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ACEI prescribe concomitant hypertension . A review available literature efficacy study various type angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor sperm count quality reveal near-consistent finding improvement animal study . However , methodological flaw render result scanty human study extremely difficult interpret . The current study design intentionally rigorous ; effort consciously make control know confound factor far possible . Methods . The study conduct University Nigeria Teaching Hospital , Enugu . A prior approval detail study protocol obtain Ethics Committee hospital . Each patient give inform consent enrollment study . The investigation longitudinal , randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial crossover design . The subject investigation select volunteer pool male patient attend fertility clinic University Nigeria Teaching Hospital , Enugu . At time enrollment subject give explicit information study respect intention , expectation , procedure , plan duration investigation , potential adverse reaction could occur intend medication . The recruitment patient take place March 1998 September 2001 actual study last five year , January 2002 December 2006 . In strict compliance protocol requirement participant enter study within 7 day start onset follow concurrently . Throughout period clinical trial patient mandate continue different `` background '' fertility medication dose prescribed attend fertility physician . The rationale avoid unethical situation whereby group take placebo would deny medication . Conceited effort make exclude subject background medication document interaction lisinopril . The apparent superfluity combine crossover design ( provide within-subjects control ) separate ( between-subjects ) control deliberate . That do effort control , one swoop , two potentially confounding factor ; viz. , possible effect study out-come concurrent background medication , possible event random , seasonal variation human seminal fluid characteristic . Throughout whole period study investigator keep close touch patient phone call order continually motivate , remind scheduled appointment date , monitor compliance detect possible incidence adverse drug effect . Assessment compliance medication : Compliance medication monitor combination oral interview physical inspection medication container pill count . These do every scheduled visit , sporadic phone call unscheduled home visit . The level compliance patient express percent ( % ) calculate actual number dose taken/the expect number dos multiply 100 period consideration . Adverse event monitoring : The patient encourage report every event promptly phone one author ( NOG ) , matter however minor mind whether related lisinopril . Entries promptly make one physician team detail make proper assessment every report case make recommendation respect management and/or need otherwise withdrawal patient trial . Medical intervention , need , give without cost patient . In addition , serum potassium concentration blood pressure ( supine erect ) measure every patient schedule visit furtherance adverse event monitoring . Clinical measurement : Blood pressure measurement do mercury sphygmomanometer fit adult-size cuff ( Accoson , England ) korotcoffs I V use systolic diastolic blood pressure respectively . This give concordant result among team member traditional I IV Korotcoffs . The mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) patient calculate use conventional formula ; MAP = [ ( 2 x diastolic ) + systolic ] divide 3 . Laboratory measurement : Seminal fluid analysis time collect self-masturbation room close laboratory submit promptly analyst . The collected semen specimen incubate 37 degree Centigrade allow stand 1 hour order thaw . The pipette method use ejaculate volume microscopic method use total sperm cell count , percentage sperm cell motility percentage abnormal sperm cell morphology accordance World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline . Serum potassium level estimate use flame photo-metric method describe Davidson Henry . The latter safeguard hyperkalemia , well document , severe side effect ACEI therapy . Statistical analysis : The statistical analysis do Statistical Package Social Sciences version 16 ( SPSS - 16 ) software . All data analysis perform basis intention-to-treat last observation baseline carry forward end point . Prior analysis parameter data examine distributional pattern use Shapiro-Wilk Normality test . All seminal fluid data well serum potassium value find skew normalized logarithmic transformation . Two-group comparison perform use unpaired Student 's t-tests proportion compare use Fisher 's Exact test . The data longitudinally measure out-come parameter analyze use two-way repeat measure ( mixed model ) analysis variance ( mixed model ANOVA ) . Bonferroni 's post-hoc multiple comparison test run wherever statistically significant difference find ( p &lt; 0.05 ) either within-subjects mean , between-subjects mean interaction . The post-hoc test do order explore pattern within-subjects parameter change duration treatment group . The unwanted event report treatment lisinopril placebo treatment compare statistical significance Koch 's adaptation Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney- rank-sum test .</detailed_description>
