	<brief_summary>Several observation make magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) characterize brain connection brain function individual schizophrenia mental disorder . For example , research investigate schizophrenia focus dysfunction connection within medial temporal lobe prefrontal cortex well pertinent brain region . This database registry allow collection clinical interview data , behavioral data , blood , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data individual without mental disorder well understand connection brain various brain region function differently volunteer perform various cognitive task . This observational study conduct collect data place registry current future investigational question relate imaging mental disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project entail collection clinical interview data , behavioral data , blood , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data 1000 volunteer , patient volunteer healthy normal volunteer . These data use current future investigation well understand brain mental disorder process differently brain healthy volunteer . The volunteer undergo series clinical interview determine diagnosis , behavioral task training , medical workup , standard structural functional magnetic resonance imaging . No change make patient volunteer ' medication treatment regime part study . Data collect volunteer group base performance variety computer-mediated cognitive task . The volunteer train criterion task , point option complete MRI fMRI portion study . Standard functional MR image entire brain acquire volunteer perform cognitive task think activate medial temporal lobe pertinent brain region . While participate task portion fMRI , visual stimulation ( image ) present via back-projection high-resolution video projector ( Epson 7000 series ) adjustable zoom . Volunteers ask push button handheld button box record response learn training . For non-task , rest portion fMRI , volunteer ask stay relaxed alert . In conjunction one fMRI scan also conduct cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) MRI investigate blood perfusion medial temporal lobe volunteer mental illness compare normal control volunteer . The propose project evaluate brain connectivity cognitive task , include novelty detection , encode retrieval association individual stimulus , cognitive task think produce abnormal fMRI activation volunteer mental disorder . One example cognitive task conduct follow . Volunteers show series one-syllable noun ask internally associate second noun present word ( e.g . `` station '' present word `` train '' ) . They press response button make successful word association . Subsequently , volunteer present mixture previously encode word new set one-syllable noun . Volunteers press one response button previously present word another button novel ( new ) word . fMRI scan part task acquire time stimulus presentation press button . In another example cognitive task , volunteer show novel series face pair name instructed remember name face . In subsequent period , volunteer attempt remember name go face . The fMRI scan acquire encode retrieval face-name pair . These two describe task representative task use term difficulty effort require volunteer . In addition , `` resting '' `` control '' task use establish baseline brain activity may compare activity task interest . Volunteers receive instruction task performance practice task prior scan order eliminate novelty task potential confound . While appointment time scan may take several hour , volunteer scanner 60 120 minute depend specific memory task administer visit . Any volunteer may receive training scan one task , volunteer keep scanner longer 120 minute give session . Volunteers may also ask undergo one two 60-minute MR Spectroscopy scan conduct 3Tesla ( 3T ) 7Tesla ( 7T ) scanner . In scan measure level different brain compound , neurotransmitter ( e.g . glutamate , gamma aminobutyric acid [ GABA ] ) endogenous brain metabolite ( e.g. , N-acetyl -aspartate ) various brain region , non-invasively study tissue biochemistry .</detailed_description>
