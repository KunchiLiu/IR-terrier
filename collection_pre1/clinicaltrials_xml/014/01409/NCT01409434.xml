	<brief_summary>This research study long term effect blood sugar cholesterol blood pressure lower medication . People invited participate research study participate Pharmacogenomic Evaluation Antihypertensive Responses ( PEAR 1 , NCT00246519 PEAR 2 , NCT01203852 ) study still take thiazide diuretic . In PEAR , effect blood pressure , blood sugar , cholesterol high blood pressure drug hydrochlorothiazide atenolol 18 week period evaluate . This PEAR follow-up study determine effect thiazide diuretic blood sugar cholesterol , period since PEAR trial . The study hypothesis long term exposure thiazide diuretic result large increase blood sugar cholesterol level short term exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Antihypertensive Exposure Adverse Metabolic Effects : PEAR Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One three death United States due cardiovascular ( CV ) disease . One three US adult hypertension , major underlie cause CV disease . Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) dyslipidemia major contributor CV morbidity mortality among hypertensive patient . Thiazide diuretic beta blocker first line agent treatment hypertension , commonly prescribe antihypertensive class contribute dysfunction glucose lipid metabolism . In randomized controlled trial , reduction CV outcome due blood pressure reduction thiazide diuretic beta blocker treatment accompany increase T2D incidence exacerbation dyslipidemia . CV morbidity mortality result persistent antihypertensive-related T2D dyslipidemia may eventually outweigh benefit blood pressure reduction , encourage use alternate antihypertensive class especially high risk patient . An accumulate body publish literature support adverse metabolic effect induce thiazide diuretic beta blocker . However , vast majority evidence adverse metabolic effect antihypertensive drug utilizes secondary analysis data randomize blood pressure reduction trial . To date , publish study compare short long term adverse metabolic effect antihypertensive therapy patient population . The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation Antihypertensive Responses ( PEAR ) study randomize , parallel assignment trial determine genetic influence blood pressure response thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide beta blocker atenolol . The PEAR study duration ( 18 week ) sufficient ass long term effect ( six month ) antihypertensive medication . The primary aim study determine effect long term thiazide beta blocker therapy glucose lipid metabolism PEAR population , short term effect assess . Secondary analysis follow-up study include investigate adverse metabolic effect long term thiazide diuretic beta blocker therapy insulin sensitivity role potassium uric acid hyperglycemic effect thiazide diuretic .</detailed_description>
