	<brief_summary>Objective : evaluate perforator base interposition plasty comparison standard technique ( full thickness graft ) scar contracture release . Study design : A randomised control multicentre intervention study . Study population : Patients , age 18 year old , require surgery release scar contracture , eligible study . In total 50 patient recruit follow-up 3 month post-operatively . Intervention : A release contracture perform combination òr standard technique ( full thickness graft ) òr perforator base interposition plasty . Main study parameters/endpoints : main study parameter amount contraction flap/graft three month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Scar contracture remain considerable problem burn patient . The standard method treatment contracture release combination application full split thickness graft close defect . Unfortunately , effectiveness skin graft limit scar contraction , often necessitate additional reconstruction . Moreover , part skin graft may lose due poor revascularisation infection . Since discovery perforator vessel , many type new flap harvest long incorporate perforator bundle ( artery vein ) . This flap design base perforator vessel local available skin , lead increase flap survival superior functional outcome . Based concept develop explored possibility algorithm treatment mean pilot study perform 22 patient scar contracture . Results show survival flap 100 % expansion surface area 16 % follow least 3 month . However implication use perforator base flap burn surgery mean RCT yet determine . Primary objective : Is interpositioned skin superior quality , represent less contraction use perforator base interposition flap , compare gold standard ( full thickness graft ) , 3 month , measure transparent sheet planimetry ? Secondary objective : - Survival flap/graft : i.e . measure amount necrosis - The quality scar : elasticity , colour , subjective scar evaluation Inclusion criterion : - Indication release burn scar contracture - Sufficient tissue perforator- base interposition flap ( preferably normal skin ) - Able give inform consent Exclusion criterion : - Age &lt; 18 year - Location : scar face scalp - Smoking ( however , patient eligible smoking quit &gt; 3 week operation ) - Psychiatric disorder ( loss follow-up anticipate ) - Language barrier</detailed_description>
