	<brief_summary>Standard high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( HF-TMS ) noninvasive method activate de-activate neuron superficial region brain induction weak electric current brain tissue produce rapidly change magnetic field . Studies generally show standard HF-TMS effective treating major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , although treatment effect often highly variable several negative trial specialize literature . One reason discrepant result might standard HF-TMS enables direct stimulation superficial brain area , consequently , possible stimulation deeper widespread brain region could produce superior reliable result . Recently , novel form HF-rTMS ( call deep transcranial magnetic stimulation DTMS ) , allow direct stimulation much large deep brain region , also show effective safe treat MDD . Neuroimaging study show standard HF-rTMS directly affect several superficial area brain , date data brain effect DTMS . Thus , study aim explore , first time , brain effect DTMS MDD . More specifically , , investigator , hope identify possible neural predictor clinical improvement DTMS also clarify impact DTMS brain activity time . In study , DTMS apply left side front head ( region know 'prefrontal cortex ' ) , compare standard HF-TMS term effectiveness brain effect . For , subject least moderate MDD randomize receive daily DTMS standard HF-rTMS treatment 4 week , undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) treatment . fMRI neuroimaging technique allow u measure area brain less 'active ' response specific stimulus particular time . During fMRI session , use validate cognitive task work memory . Our result could eventually lead u , among thing , identify depressed patient would best candidate receive either standard HF-rTMS DTMS , area brain target neuromodulation technique .</brief_summary>
