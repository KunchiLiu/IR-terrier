	<brief_title>3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging Breast Cancer Detection High Risk Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life time risk develop breast cancer greatly elevate woman familial breast cancer , especially BRCA carrier . Prevention early detection strategy high risk woman include risk reduce surgery , chemoprevention close surveillance semiannual clinical breast exam yearly mammograms start age 25-35 . Unfortunately , screen mammography detect half breast cancer mutation carrier , presumably due high breast density young woman perhaps due inherent characteristic tumor rapid growth . In light limitation high risk group , suggest incorporation semiannual mammogram and/or image modality ultrasound ( US ) MRI . In study , high risk woman suspicious mammographic lesion - categorize Breast Imaging Reporting data System ( BI-RADS ) 4 recruit undergo breast MRI biopsy suspicious abnormality . All woman undergo biopsy part standard care . The result MRI influence decision whether biopsy perform . The MRI result compare biopsy result pathology gold standard .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women high risk develop breast cancer outline American Cancer society ( ACS ) : woman know predispose mutation ( BRCA1 , 2 PTEN gene ) , woman first degree relative know carrier 20 % life time risk breast cancer . The highrisk woman suspicious lesion classify BIRADS 4 detect mammography . Since spatial resolution 3.0T breast MRI similar digital mammography , limitation size mammographic lesion . Pregnancy lactate woman Contraindications MRI : 1. electrical implant ( e.g . cardiac pacemaker perfusion pump ) 2. ferromagnetic implant aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , tattoo near eye , steel implant 3. preexist medical condition include likelihood develop seizure claustrophobic reaction , great normal potential cardiac arrest 4. weight 350 lb Although woman meet criteria high risk breast cancer abnormal mammogram , exclude study insurer provide payment breast MRI . The suspicious lesion biopsied mammographic guidance part standard care . The third party carrier reimburse payment breast MRI high risk woman , especially ACS guideline release 2007 . Therefore , outcome unlikely occur .</criteria>
