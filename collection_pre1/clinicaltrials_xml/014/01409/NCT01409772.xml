	<brief_title>Evaluation Clinical Practice Using 70 % Ethanol Lock Solution Prevention Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections Pediatric Patients Undergoing Intestinal Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter- related blood stream infection serious complication pediatric patient receive parenteral nutrition . The leading cause death infant short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) treat parenteral nutrition central line sepsis liver failure associate prolonged use parenteral nutrition . ( Cuffari , 2006 ) Incidence infection range 3 % 60 % life span catheter . ( Fratino , 2002 ) Interruption nutritional support , antibiotic resistance septic complication result frequent infection life threaten fragile patient population . This patient population dependent upon maintenance central venous access survival . Frequent hospitalization , loss work , financial complication result decrease quality life patient caretaker . The cost hospital treatment catheter relate bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) estimate range $ 4000 $ 56,000 occurrence . ( MMWR 2002 ) Vascular access site also limit pediatric population , removal central access infection may diminish future ability provide vital parenteral nutrition . ( MMWR , 2002 ) Therefore , improvement ability prevent infection utmost importance patient population . The concept antibiotic lock technique develop late 1980s derive various heparin lock protocol . Antibiotic lock use management prevention infection vascular access device . Antimicrobial choice use antibiotic lock technique dependent different pathogen suspect infect catheter lumen , characteristic organisms , pharmacodynamic property antimicrobial agent . There risk selection multi-drug resistant organism antibiotic lock utilize . In addition , heparin must add antibiotic lock solution maintain catheter patency . More recently , ethanol lock utilized treatment option child CRBSIs . Ethanol bactericidal fungicidal nature also reveal thrombolytic property . ( Mouw , 2008 ) The thrombolytic property eliminate need heparin addition maintain catheter patency . Although utilized treatment , ethanol currently use CRBSI prevention institution . Along decrease risk emerge antibiotic resistance , investigator attempt determine use ethanol lock solution diminish number infection Intestinal Rehabilitation Program population , lead decrease patient complication cost . UNMC large population Intestinal Rehabilitation Program participant country make uniquely well-suited clinic gather data surround emerge infection-prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
