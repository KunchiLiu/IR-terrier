	<brief_summary>This study patient Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) surgery remove tumor . The main purpose study study safe suitable treatment Afatinib participant surgery remove tumor . Another goal study see treatment Afatinib affect growth activity tumor . Afatinib approve use FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) experimental . In person , growth cancer cell think stimulate Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) . This protein find body bind cell wall site call receptor stimulates cell growth . Some cell many receptor uncontrolled growth , develop cancer tumor . There several cancer drug bind receptor slow stop cancer growth Gefitinib erlotinib FDA approve used treatment NSCLC . The drug Afatinib show inhibit mutate EGF receptor clinical trial may candidate treatment NSCLC variety early stage cancer . Participants study take Afatinib mouth , pill form , least 14 day schedule surgery remove cancer tumor . Participants observe side effect follow 30 day surgery assess result surgery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm NSCLC , deem surgical candidate standard criterion . Patients histology allow enroll . Patients Stage IA IIIA disease ECOG Performance Status 01 Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion Mediastinoscopy and/or Endoscopic Bronchial Ultrasound ( EBUS ) and/or Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) complete surgical stag clinically indicate Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dl , SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≥ 3 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Serious , active infection must control . Patients may enrol still antibiotic long clinical sign active infection resolve . A sign informed consent document ( ICD ) Patients 18 year older Able willing take oral medication Known preexist lung disease . History presence clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormality uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure NYHA classification 3 , unstable angina poorly control arrhythmia . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior randomization . Significant recent acute gastrointestinal disorder diarrhea major symptom e.g . Crohn 's disease , malabsorption CTC grade ≥2 diarrhea etiology . Baseline ( &lt; 1 month treatment ) cardiac leave ventricular function rest ejection fraction le 50 % measure multigated blood pool image heart ( MUGA scan ) echocardiogram Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction anilinoquinazolins like gefitinib , erlotinib BIBW 2992 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would preclude patient undergo surgery Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) lactate Inability comply study and/or followup procedure Patients surgical candidate refuse surgery</criteria>
