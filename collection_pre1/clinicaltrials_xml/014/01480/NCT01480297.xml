	<brief_title>Pilot Study Determine Effects Salsalate Type 1 Diabetes Painful Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project use establish preliminary data plan NIH-sponsored multicenter study effect salsalate diabetic neuropathy ( DN ) people type 1 diabetes . Diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DN ) ultimately affect one-half patient type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) major cause disability , high mortality , poor quality life . Although intensive glucose control proven efficacy delay prevent DN T1DM type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , people diabetes reach maintain glycemic level need achieve benefit . In addition , many patient diabetes still develop diabetic complication , include DN , despite good glucose control . For DN , disease modify treatment glycemic control available . Therefore , essential identify new drug target treat DN early possible course . The investigator plan , multi-center study first determine effect anti-inflammatory agent , salsalate , DN development progression , DN pain type 1 diabetes . This proof-of-concept pilot study measure effect short term ( 12 week ) treatment Salsalate novel establish measure peripheral neuropathy . Ultimately , may permit measurement treatment effect short period time use establish measure nerve conduction study . Salsalate , prodrug form salicylate , use treat osteoarthritis rheumatologic condition . It highly effective modulate IKKβ/NF-κB pathway , large margin safety , glucose lower effect patient type 2 diabetes . The IKKβ/NF-κB pathway unique implicate pathogenesis nerve fiber loss well pain DN . The propose study design employ quantifiable early measure DN , IENFD thigh , allow accurate assessment actual nerve fiber density time . In pilot study , biomarkers pain find IENF 's well IENFD measure pre post 3 month treatment Salsalate , 3 gram daily .</detailed_description>
