	<brief_title>Paravertebral Block Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The strategy use manage nephrolithiasis include medical expulsive therapy , extracorporeal shock wave ( ESWL ) , ureteroscopy , open surgery percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) . PCNL inpatient procedure perform two step . Step 1 , placement drainage line ( nephrostomy tube ) back collect system kidney . This step typically perform interventional radiologist conscious sedation . Step 2 performed urologist involve dilate tract nephrostomy tube , placement access sheath actual removal stone use endoscopic equipment . The minimally invasive approach PCNL well accept effective open procedure stone removal less morbidity . Post-operative pain management remain challenge lead extend hospital stay . This randomized , double-blinded trial design assess effect paravertebral block intra-operative post-operative pain control .</detailed_description>
