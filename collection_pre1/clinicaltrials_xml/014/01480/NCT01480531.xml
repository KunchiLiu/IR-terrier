	<brief_summary>2 . Purpose Study - 1 . To determine feasibility Clevidipine use rapidly achieve maintain individually specify patient BP target range pre postoperative period aortic aneurysm dissection management . 2 . To determine safety Clevidipine use pre postoperative period aneurysm dissection management 3 . Background &amp; Significance - Surgical treatment person aortic root/arch dissection aneurysm significantly improve survival . However , critical management patient precise control blood pressure ( BP ) . With increase BP , acute chronic , risk fatal nonfatal vascular complication imminent . Similarly , excessive lower arterial pressure , cerebral , spinal cord , cardiac , renal ischemic hypoperfusion also noteworthy . Typically , target systolic blood pressure range patient 100-120 mmHg . Several different class vasoactive agent current use acutely manage BP none posse optimal profile ideal vasodilator . Notable limitation include inadequate potency , slow onset offset action , multiple receptor function , safety concern , importantly , restricted/ineffective titration , result clinically significant hemodynamic cardiovascular perturbation . Recently , ultra short-acting intravenous dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker clevidipine ( Cleviprex , The Medicines Company ) approve management BP critical care setting . Clevidipine 's pharmacology lend acute management BP broad critical care set surgical nonsurgical patient . In current study , investigator propose characterize hemodynamic effect CLV pre post-operative management BP patient aortic aneurysm/dissection . 4 . Design &amp; Procedures Eligible patient approach participate study Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) attend and/or cardiothoracic surgical/anesthesiology fellow cardiac research nurse . All aspects clinical management monitoring accord standard practice include : - ECG - Oxymetry - Temperature - Invasive arterial blood pressure - Recording routine laboratory result - Imaging study include CT/MRI ( A ) / Echocardiography - Pulmonary artery catheter ( postoperative patient ) - Mechanical ventilation ( postoperative patient ) - According establish protocol acute intravenous management arterial blood pressure patient , upper low threshold systolic blood pressure prescribe attend physician ( range ( 100 mmHg -120 mm Hg SBP ) . Hemodynamic data collect continuously via bedside laptop well pertinent clinical data information efficacy safety record . â€¢ Subjective evaluation efficacy CLV ( questionnaire format complete critical care team )</brief_summary>
