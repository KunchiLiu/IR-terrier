	<brief_title>Impact Raltegravir Intensification HIV-1-infected Subjects With Complete Viral Suppression Under Monotherapy With Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIDS continue major global health priority . Although important progress achieve prevent new HIV infection lower annual number AIDS-related death , number people live HIV worldwide continue grow 2008 , reach estimate 33.4 million . AIDS-related illness remain one leading cause death globally project continue significant global cause premature mortality come decade : estimate 3 million new HIV infection 2 million death due AIDS-related illness occur worldwide 2008 ( UNAIDS , report 2009 ) . In contrast fail attempt develop vaccine HIV , effort provide drug therapy stand great success . More 25 agent approve thus far , right combination suppress replication virus , often keep blood level low undetectable standard test . These powerful drug combination , collectively term highly active antiretroviral therapy , HAART , prolong life health countless infect individual . Although life expectancy HAART-treated people develop country significantly improve , treatment carefully observe avoid virus rebound , happen day treatment withdrawal ( 13 ) . Moreover , long-term treatment exempt complication , include continuous likelihood develop drug resistance induction significant metabolic disturbance consequence drug toxicity , clinically impact future health HIV-infected patient , include hyperlipidaemia , lipodystrophy , metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Finally , cost full HIV-1 treatment implementation disregard . Only Catalunya , annual cost antiretroviral approach 300 million Euros . Guidelines use antiretrovirals HIV-1 infection recommend combine least three agent . However , toxicity , cost , complexity regimen warrant search option . Boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy one appealing option investigate . Different clinical trial evaluate efficacy boost protease inhibitor monotherapy several clinical setting : maintenance therapy HAART-suppressed subject ( 1-3 , 12 ) , salvage regimen ( 10 ) first-line treatment ( 4 , 7-9 ) . Monotherapies boost lopinavir darunavir largely investigated maintenance induction-maintenance strategy , show able maintain viral suppression high proportion patient . Thus , Darunavir/ritonavir DRV/r Lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/r accept option monotherapy regimens triple therapy possible . To determine role low-level replication maintain HIV infection , group recently exploit unique effect Raltegravir viral replication ( 6 ) . This integrase inhibitor block integration viral linear cDNA genomic host cell DNA . Under normal condition , absence raltegravir , small proportion linear cDNA circularize host DNA repair enzyme form episomes one two copy viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 1-LTR 2-LTR circle ) . We reason persistent , ongoing low-level viral replication patient antiretroviral therapy , raltegravir administration result measurable increase 2-LTR circle blood , happen . Furthermore , 2-LTR-positive subject receive raltegravir show marked decrease CD8+ T-cell activation marker , provide may first vivo demonstration ongoing immune activation attributable , part , ongoing , albeit low-level , viral replication . It seem likely contribution mechanism maintain HIV infection varies person person dependent multiple variable , include genetics , development resistance , concurrent infection , viral strain , stage disease antiretroviral regimen . In fact , among patient receive raltegravir study , main difference 2-LTR-positive 2-LTR-negative group antiretroviral regimen use : total 61 % patient 2-LTR-positive group protease inhibitor-containing regimen time raltegravir add , compare 19 % 2-LTR-negative group ( P = 0.011 ) . It possible presence three reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor-sparing regimen reduces probability formation linear cDNA precursor episomal cDNA . It also possible active replication occur anatomic compartment less accessible protease inhibitor pharmacodynamic variability protease inhibitor contribute observation . To explore previous observation , design pilot trial patient boost protease inhibitor single-agent strategy suppressive plasma viremia standard assay would treatment temporary intensify raltegravir . This provide insight level residual viral replication immune-affectation patient boost protease inhibitor monotherapy .</detailed_description>
