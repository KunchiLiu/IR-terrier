	<brief_summary>The use robotic surgery management gynecologic cancer increase exponentially United States since implementation technology 2005 . In Canada , access system limit lack government funding . The government reluctant fund technology robust data , true impact patient care , lack . This project prospectively examine outcome woman , early stage endometrial cancer , treat surgically . Open surgery compare minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) include conventional laparoscopy robotic surgery . The data collect include detailed assessment surgical data , peri-operative event , quality life analysis , health economic evaluation evaluation MIS rate .</brief_summary>
