	<detailed_description>This First Time Human ( FTIH ) study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) single , escalate dos intranasal ( i.n . ) GSK2245035 healthy male volunteer ( HVT ) male subject allergic rhinitis ( AR ) . The safety tolerability single i.n . GSK2245035 dose assess establish HVT initiation evaluation AR . GSK2245035 highly selective Toll-like Receptor 7 ( TLR7 ) agonist capable preferentially induce production IFNα rather TNFα . Activation TLR7 know result upregulation co-stimulatory signal antigen-presenting cell generation pro-inflammatory mediator shift bystander immune response towards Helper T-cell Type 1/ Regulatory T cell ( Th1/Treg ) phenotype therefore reduce magnitude Helper T-cell Type 2 ( Th2 ) reactivity . In context , propose i.n . GSK2245035 administration may alter airway immune environment way result long-lasting control AR symptoms potentially disease remission persistent modification underlie aberrant Th2 responsiveness aeroallergens . The aim study collect tolerability , PK PD information enable identification appropriate safe dos i.n . GSK2245035 , associate up-regulation TLR7-mediated gene nasal milieu , use subsequent clinical drug development study . The study divide two part . Part 1 , involve healthy volunteer , consist 8 cohort receive dos 2 nanogram ( 2 ng ) 4000ng placebo dose . Administration within cohort stagger two subject ( one receive drug one placebo ) dose monitor 24 hour subsequent dos . Screening part 2 study begin data cohort 4 part 1 find satisfactory . Part 2 involve subject Allergic Rhinitis divide three cohort receive dos 20ng 4000ng placebo dose .</detailed_description>
