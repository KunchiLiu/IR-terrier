	<detailed_description>Background Vena saphena magna frequently use graft material coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG . Vein graft harvest conventional open technique ( OVH = open vein harvest ) , various endoscopic less invasive technique ( EVH = Endoscopic vein harvest ) . The endoscopic technique show reduce incidence postoperative wound complication patient satisfy cosmetic surgery result . Non-randomized trial , however , cast doubt patency rate vein graft follow EVH compare OVH , study include one randomize trial fail detect problem regard . There data regard long-term patency rate follow EVH . It therefore valuable conduct secondary follow-up among CABG patient 4-7 year ago include randomize trial focus wound complication leg . Although study design evaluate clinical result patency rate vein graft , study may still contribute important knowledge result come randomized patient cohort , contrast result study . Purpose To investigate long-term patency rate ( 4-7 year ) patency rate clinical outcome follow EVH OVH first-time CABG . We also want perform health economic analysis ( cost-effectiveness analysis ) ass two harvest method . Hypotheses : 1 . Patency rate follow EVH bad compare OVH CABG 4-7 year postoperatively . 2 . EVH associate increased incidence recurrence angina need re-revascularization compare OVH . 3 . Although EVH immediately lead high direct cost compare OVH , health economic benefit method long run . Methods : This experiment consist follow-up among 129 132 former patient underwent first-time CABG April 2004 - June 2007 Aalborg Hospital , Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark , compare EVH OVH . Register data collect patient record review . Surviving patient invited clinical evaluation . CT-angio order compare long-term patency rate vein graft perform . Furthermore incidence recurrent angina , acute coronary syndrome , need re-revascularization cardiovascular death since operation wil evaluate . All direct indirect cost two method surgery throughout postoperative course study value order perform health economic analysis ( cost-effectiveness analysis ) . Subjects The age previous trial subject 65 year ( range 43-90 year , time include previous study , survivor 4-7 year old today . It expect survive former patient participate study . Inclusion Criteria All 129 former patient include initial trial may include . Deceased patient include trial regard registry data medical record . Exclusion criterion ( relation clinical examination ) : Lack consent . ( Register Data previous patient give informed consent clinical follow-up may include study ) Exclusion criterion ( relation CT-angio ) : Former patient least one follow exclusion criterion CT-angio perform : p-creatinine &gt; 120 micromol / l Estimated GFR ( eGFR = estimate glomerular filtration rate ) per 1.73 m2 &lt; 60 ml / min . Atrial fibrillation Allergy contrast medium Pregnancy Breastfeeding Lack consent</detailed_description>
