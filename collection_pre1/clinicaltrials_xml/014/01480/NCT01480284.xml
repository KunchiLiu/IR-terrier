	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety GSK548470 administer daily dose level 300 mg Japanese patient compensate chronic hepatitis B untreated nucleic acid analogue . In efficacy , non-inferiority GSK548470 ETV verify use antiviral effect index .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study GSK548470 Patients With Compensated Chronic Hepatitis B Untreated With Nucleic Acid Analogue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , randomize , active comparator-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group comparison study Japanese patient compensate chronic hepatitis B untreated nucleic acid analogue subsequent open-label study . Efficacy safety compare once-daily dose GSK548470 300 mg once-daily dose ETV 0.5 mg , subsequently efficacy safety GSK548470 administer long term investigate . A total 165 subject assign GSK548470 group ETV group ratio 2:1 . The subject assign stratified randomization term HBe antigen serum HBV-DNA level . The primary purpose verify non-inferiority GSK548470 ETV use index change amount HBV-DNA level Week 24 baseline level . The secondary purpose investigate efficacy safety GSK548470 300 mg administer daily long term .</detailed_description>
