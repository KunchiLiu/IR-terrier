	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Combined Treatment With Ipilimumab Intratumoral Interleukin-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intratumoral injection interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) melanoma metastases highly efficient local treatment . Furthermore , systemic effect assume base observation favorable long term outcome . However , objective response untreated lesion observe yet . Ipilimumab seem efficient subset treat patient inhibition down-regulation tumor-specific cellular immune-responses . In context propose trial , assume ( ) ipilimumab could potentiate systemic melanoma-specific immune response , primarily induce intratumoral IL-2 ( ii ) immune responses become effective regard IL-2 inject distant lesion . Therefore assume synergistic effect regard efficiency combination .</detailed_description>
