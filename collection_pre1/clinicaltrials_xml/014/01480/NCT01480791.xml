	<brief_summary>This study perform Jewish General Hospital . It investigate effect treatment aliskiren , inhibitor renin , substance produce kidney constricts arteries raise blood pressure , blood vessel , specifically artery , subject diabetes elevated blood pressure ( hypertension ) . To investigate blood vessel , different technique use . For large artery , study non invasive method use detection pulse wave use ultrasound skin neck , wrist groin . To study small vessel , investigator perform biopsy buttock , local anesthesia , obtain small sample tissue skin , vessel dissect . The investigator perform many hundred small biopsy past 20 year similar study without complication . The biopsy well tolerate . From research investigator thus able learn structure function vessel patient , comparison normal healthy group . The hypertensive diabetic subject assign chance ( randomized trial ) treatment renin inhibitor aliskiren comparator , diuretic hydrochlorothiazide . Aliskiren relatively new drug use treat hypertension well tolerate evaluate numerous trial hypertensive diabetic individual . The diuretic well-know agent use treat high blood pressure many year , well tolerate . Physicians , nurse scientist involve study unaware receive drug , patient ( mean double-blind trial ) . However , problem , secret code break individual withdrawn study . Subjects treat year , study procedure ( non invasive biopsy ) repeat 6 month one year treatment . During study , blood sample draw urine collect certain interval ensure safety treatment . Once tissue obtain studied laboratory . The study vessel allow treatment u determine treatment renin inhibitor aliskiren affect structure function well cellular molecular aspect artery hypertensive diabetic person . The investigator expect study provide u knowledge mechanism perhaps new target future therapy cardiovascular disease hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hypertensive Group Diabetes mellitus ( diagnose least 6 month ) define usual criterion base basal glycemia glucose tolerance test . Diabetes must well control , glycosylated hemoglobin 0.08 ( 8 % ) . Hypertension define mean SiSBP &gt; 130 mmHg SiDBP 85115mmHg screen visit , two week placebo therapy . ( Hypertension consider essential evidence underlie treatable cause suitable clinical laboratory assessment . Hypertensive patient may take antihypertensive agent except renin inhibitor . They may take ACE inhibitor ARB , discontinue . If HCTZ , eligible participate . Subjects 3070 year old Informed Consent obtain patient Criteria inclusion : Control Group Diabetic define : hemoglobin A1C &lt; 0.06 ( 6 % ) / fast glycemia &lt; 5.6mmol/L . Hypertensive define : SiSBP ≤120 mmHg and/or SiDBP ≤80mmHg Subjects 3070 year old Informed Consent obtain patient Uncontrolled diabetes ( define : preprandial glycemia usually 10 mmol/L glycosylated hemoglobin 0.08 ) . Renovascular hypertension History malignant hypertension Sitting systolic blood pressure &gt; 210 mmHg Cerebrovascular accident within past year , current transient ischemic attack History myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary angioplasty coronary artery bypass surgery Clinically significant AV conduction disturbance and/or arrhythmia ( e.g . second thirddegree AV block ; Sicksinus syndrome clinically significant bradycardia rest heart rate &lt; 45 beats/minute ) . Tachyarrhythmias ; clinically significant arrhythmias Presence accessory bypass tract ( e.g . WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome ) Angina pectoris Current prior history heart failure know leave ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40 % History unexplained syncope know syncopal disorder ( e.g. , StokesAdams Syndrome ) Presence know history hemodynamically significant obstructive valvular disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Hypertensive patient already take renin inhibitor . Concomitant treatment Psychotropic Antidepressant Agents Major psychotropic agent phenothiazine permit . Chronic dos antidepressant permit . Oral Contraceptives allow patient 's hypertension induce medication . Regular use NSAID permit take regularly stable regimen . Aspirin small dos ( ≤ 1 g/day ) cardioprotective agent permit . Acetaminophen permit . Other Drugs Concomitant use oral inhaled steroid , ACTH , immunosuppressants lithium allow , cyclosporine , quinidine , aliskiren available market . Laboratory Parameters Glycosylated hemoglobin 0.08 ( 8 % ) . Plasma creatinine concentration ≥ 200 μmol/L ( adjust age weight ) . Prior patient entry , hematuria evaluate , etiology established/documented , treatment render appropriate . Offtreatment serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mmol/L ≤ 3.5 mmol/L AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &gt; 2 x normal upper limit , clinically significant Clinically significant laboratory value outside establish normal range include limit follow parameter : hematocrit , hemoglobin , platelet count white blood cell count Allergies/Hypersensitivity /Pulmonary Known hypersensitivity contraindication aliskiren thiazide diuretic . History clinically important malabsorption gastrointestinal resection . Smoking 10 cigarette exclude . Also exclude coexistent condition could independently affect histology resistance vessel except diabetes ( e.g . disease may associate vasculitides : collagenvascular disease , chronic hepatitis B antigenemia , circulate immune complex , complement disorder , amyloidosis , scleroderma , etc. ) . Pregnancy lactate female . Females childbearing age surgically sterilize use effective contraception may enter exclusionary pregnancy test do within 72 hour first doubleblind dose test agent . Pregnancy test do monthly throughout study woman capable conception . Other concurrent severe disease could preclude participation survival , neoplasm Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , patient know HIV positive . Any known bleeding platelet disorder . The known absence one kidney . Patients currently abuse previously abuse alcohol drug substance ( within past two year ) . Mentally legally incapacitate patient . Patients participate another investigational drug trial , include use market drug ( i.e . patient sign consent form ) , within 28 day prior start placebo therapy . Patients , opinion investigator , cooperate fully , keep appointment generally unreliable . Inability unwillingness part patient sign Patient Consent Form . Phase V Korotkoff sound detect .</criteria>
