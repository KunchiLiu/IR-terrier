	<brief_summary>The present study propose characterization sleep pattern healthy young adult , elderly individual individual 85 year old , use polysomnographic recording , order clarify importance sleep longevity . Furthermore , study intend analyze oxidative stress-related gene expression peripheral blood three study group , use Superarray - RT2 Profiler '' PCR Array System . After identification gene whose expression pattern among group suggest specific role longevity , mechanisms gene expression regulation , include DNA methylation pattern microRNA expression , well possible genomic source variation gene investigate . In addition , old individual ( 105 years-old ) whole genome sequence use next-generation sequencing technology , order identify rare variant associate longevity . Subsequently , effect polymorphism rare variant identify confirm expanded sample constitute individual various age-ranges . The study provide good characterization molecular physiological mechanism involve longevity , hop contribute development advance clinical tool , capable offer well quality life elderly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In last decade , increase life expectancy highlight world population age irreversible process . The oxidative stress hypothesis age suggests accumulation oxidative damage lifespan may relate loss cellular function , process normally associate senescence . However , propose individual live longer successful manner tend adapt age physiological change . Sleep essential maintain health well-being . Growing evidence suggest interrelationship oxidative stress sleep , latter important mechanism involve redox balance maintenance . Therefore , present study propose characterization sleep pattern healthy young adult , elderly individual individual 85 year old , use polysomnographic recording , order clarify importance sleep longevity . Furthermore , study intend analyze oxidative stress-related gene expression peripheral blood three study group , use Superarray - RT2 Profiler '' PCR Array System . After identification gene whose expression pattern among group suggest specific role longevity , mechanisms gene expression regulation , include DNA methylation pattern microRNA expression , well possible genomic source variation gene investigate . In addition , old individual ( 105 years-old ) whole genome sequence use next-generation sequencing technology , order identify rare variant associate longevity . Subsequently , effect polymorphism rare variant identify confirm expanded sample constitute individual various age-ranges . The study provide good characterization molecular physiological mechanism involve longevity , hop contribute development advance clinical tool , capable offer well quality life elderly .</detailed_description>
