	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-armed , open label study efficacy safety sequential IP therapy ( Irinotecan plus cisplatin ) octreotide lar treatment GI poorly diffrentiated Neuroendocrine carcinoma . Patient write consent enter phase one step trial , receive IP therpy . Once IP therapy finish without disease progression progression occur treatment , patient enter phase two step trial , receive octreotide treatment . The primary endpoint progression free survival two step respectively secondary endpoint disease control rate , overall survival safety</brief_summary>
