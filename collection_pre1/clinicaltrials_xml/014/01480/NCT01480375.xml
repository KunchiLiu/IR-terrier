	<detailed_description>Introduction Prostate biopsy procedure small sample remove man 's prostate gland later test presence cancer . It typically perform score PSA blood test rise level associate possible presence prostate cancer . The common method perform prostate biopsy procedure ultrasound guide transrectal procedure . The information obtain standard prostate biopsy deficient even mislead . Cancers miss initial even repeat biopsy . Moreover , detection tumor predict accurately tumor size location1 . It proven exact location obtain core , even initial biopsy , influence cancer detection rate2 . An imaging tool enable three-dimensional navigation prostate volume select biopsy location view previous core take allow building `` tumor map '' ' ( i.e . detect tumor size location ) . By map prostate cancer adequate treatment choose avoid insufficient treatment . However , able produce accurate mapping malignant tissue , complementary optimize pathology method also implement addition navigation system , show pre-embedding procedure keep specimen orientation , unfold , unity , location along needle notch improve histological yield hence cancer detection rate3 . The NaviGo™ Workstation ( hereafter NaviGo™ Workstation NaviGo™ System ) allow physician see prostate gland together biopsy site three dimensional ( 3D ) view , model two dimensional ( 2D ) image . The NaviGo™ Workstation design adjunct standard care procedure , work standard rectal ultrasound probe , incorporated side side technique currently employ . No change current employed procedure technique require suggest . In complementary Navigo system system semi-automatic download prostate biopsy core keep orientation , unfold unity sample develop increase pathology utility . OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE Study objective Evaluate contribution Navigo™ system , aid navigation tool TRUS prostate biopsy , increase prostate cancer detection ability . Rationale The Navigo™ system noninvasive navigation tool produce line 3D model prostate assist physician navigate prostate volume biopsy procedure without change image system biopsy routine whatsoever . The ability create 3D model prostate accurately evenly position biopsy needle enable accurate biopsy well analysis procedure pathological result , hence might improve clinical outcome may lead new treatments/diagnostic strategy . DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE The NaviGo workstation use adjunct ultrasound image biopsy procedure prostate gland . When operated conjunction standard equipment TRUS guide prostate biopsy procedure , NaviGo™ software may use follow : - To assist physician transfer display ultrasound image workstation screen ; - Build display manipulate 3D model prostate screen ; - Archiving ultrasound image 3D model ; - Providing data management solution ; - Tracking , display record biopsy needle trajectory location real time . The NaviGo™ Workstation design work standard transrectal ultrasound system without change interfere physician 's flow work . The ultrasound image display ultrasound system , information provide NaviGo provide supplementary information physician procedure . The NaviGo™ Workstation connect video output ultrasound system track ultrasound probe 's position use off-the-shelf electromagnetic tracking system consist two sensor , one ultrasound probe ( base/ non invasive part probe ) patient 's back , transmitter place beneath patient mattress , process unit , laptop computer workstation screen . Figure 1 present general view NaviGo™ Workstation . The NaviGo™ system aid tool management prostate biopsy procedure . The NaviGo™ system allow prostate biopsy tracking , record , management solution . The NaviGo™ system design assist physician perform prostate biopsy procedure display 3D model real-time track record biopsy needle location . The device include mean compensate patient body prostate motion time procedure . The 3D model rotate , manipulate display physician 's preferable choice . The Navigo™ system intend record display 3D biopsy procedure patient undergo prostate trans-rectal biopsy . The Navigo™ system intend record data initial scan , volume measurement , biopsy needle insertion . All image save review post analysis , needle location update accord physician 's marking record ultrasound image pathology result display color 3D model . In post procedure , physician defines boundary prostate select ultrasound image 3D model prostate display record biopsy specimen ' location display prostatic volume . The physician able examine post analysis scatter quality biopsy specimens prostatic volume update pathology result . Summary features/capabilities incorporate NaviGo™ Workstation . 1 . Patient data management ( record , retrieval , off-line analysis addition biopsy result ) . 2 . Contour-based 3D model prostate ( surface rendering ) . 3 . Real-time track needle trajectory - trajectory display 3D model . 4 . Recording biopsy location - use operator supply information regard biopsy obtain , 20mm long mark provide bottom part 3D model ( trajectory cross 3D model ) , mark number link relevant save US image . 5 . Prostate volume calculation measurement - 3D model display volume calculation , 2D measurement capability ( point point inside model ) available . 6 . Off line procedure plan - previous acquire 3D model updated pathology result physician schematically place future biopsy location . 7 . Pathology result management display - update pathology result 3D model color display accord severity result . 8 . Procedure report - automatically generated end procedure HTML format . The report also save external memory device view late time . METHODS AND PROCEDURES Study Design 1 . The study open prospective study . 2 . The trans-rectal ultrasound guide prostate biopsy procedure conduct accord standard 12 biopsy scheme . 3 . In addition normal procedure set , Electromagnetic flat transmitter patient 's mattress , 2 externally attached sensor Navigo™ system stand include laptop computer workstation screen ( detailed appendix A - User 's Manual ) . 4 . Following initial prostate scan standard volume measurement do physician , 3D on-line model produce supplementary information B-mode standard image . The physician navigate determine biopsy position use standard B-mode ultrasound image 3D prostate on- line model , show work station screen . 5 . The biopsy sample obtain place straighten designated pathology cassette kit orient biopsy , constitute nitrate cellulose filter membrane . ( See appendix B , C ) . 6 . Patient detail , core location prostate volume save future analysis planning . 7 . The data obtain experiment compare retrospective data comparable cohort patient go standard procedure biopsy scheme . ( The control cohort choose similar patient 's characteristics- age , PSA level ) . End point - Cancer detection rate ( via pathology ) compare control group- standard 12 biopsy retrospective data . - Analysis positive core distribution prostate volume . - Detection rate vs. PSA level . SUBJECT RECRUITMENT Study population recruit pool patient schedule standard trans-rectal biopsy procedure POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE PATIENTS The Navigo™ system navigation aid tool assist physician navigate prostate volume . The physician locate biopsy core accord desire biopsy scheme . The physician see on-line location previous core obtain , thus gain advisable dispersing core avoid overlap adjacent core . Core position save post procedure analysis future planning . Therefore patient gain accurate position biopsy core , may increase cancer detection rate current biopsy produce baseline information future procedure . POTENTIAL RISKS TO THE PATIENTS The Navigo™ system aid tool require change procedure perform today n't come instead B-mode ultrasound , work parallel , add 3D information . The various component come direct contact patient physician computer 3D tracking system well within require safety protocol . Hence , risk patient . The 3D tracking system approve FDA medical use classify Type CF stringent classification , require application applied part direct conductive contact heart application consider necessary . The 3D tracking system also part approve Helsinki trial Bnei-Zion hospital ( monitor birth progress , trial initiate Dr. Yoav Paltieli ) Adverse effect , pain discomfort patient expect accord accumulated experience gain series preliminary experiment preform 30 patient Navigo™ system Bnei-Zion part Helsinki trail ( 0101-10-BNZ ) . The system also approve used Haemek medical center ( Helsinki number , 0018-11 ) Meir medical center ( ? ) . Therefore , view mention information risk patient user .</detailed_description>
