	<brief_summary>On behalf consortium 19 health insurance company Institute Research Operative Medicine part University Witten / Herdecke gGmbH plan conduct clinical study evaluate efficacy effectiveness negative pressure wound therapy treatment wound heal disorder foot , cause diabetes mellitus . This german multicenter study due evaluate whether negative pressure wound therapy control therapy ( standard wound therapy follow guideline ) superior . Patients randomly assign two study arm . Both patient treatment staff know specific allocation negative pressure wound therapy standard wound therapy arm . A photo documentation computer-based evaluation wound image perform . This do centrally independent examiner , ` know neither patient treatment assignment . It believe application negative pressure wound therapy system compare standard therapy diabetic foot wound lead frequent rapid achievement complete wound closure use negative pressure wound therapy effective safe therapy option treatment diabetic foot wound inpatient outpatient care . Patient´s include study either chronic diabetic foot wound exist longer 4 week whereas dead tissue component must completely remove doctor wound amputation foot part . The study treatment may already start hospital applicable . The wound treatment mainly perform within outpatient care . Study Participants return study centre regular study visit even wind treatment . The comparison outcomes study arm give valuable information efficacy negative pressure wound therapy inpatient well outpatient care . These result provide end 2016 basis decision Federal Joint Committee answer question negative pressure wound therapy approve standard service reimbursement health insurance company .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Study Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Diabetic Foot Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study project part European tender aim prove efficacy effectiveness negative pressure wind therapy management patient chronic diabetic foot wound . The task within study project assign three contractor / institution . On behalf consortium 19 health insurance company central contact consist `` AOK-Bundesverband GbR '' , `` Verband der Ersatzkassen e.V . '' ( vdek ) `` Knappschaft '' contractor responsible conduct trial . The Institute Research Operative Medicine ( IFOM ) part University Witten / Herdecke gGmbH responsible planning , implementation , analysis publication study . The Private University Witten / Herdecke take sponsorship study project . The duty responsibilities sponsor transferred staff Institute Research Operative Medicine University Witten / Herdecke . The financial support clinical study provide manufacturer negative pressure wound therapy system . The task payment process contractual provision take management company `` Gesundheitsforen Leipzig '' . Therapy system use within treatment arm study provide two manufacturer Kinetic Concepts Incorporated ( KCI ) Smith &amp; Nephew Inc. All use treatment system bear CE mark use within normal condition clinical routine accord manufacturer 's instruction . This research project perform decision Federal Joint Committee Germany , state negative pressure wound therapy can´t accept standard therapy full reimbursement health insurance company Germany . This decision base rapid report final report Institute Quality Efficiency Health Care , show systematic review meta-analysis previous study project insufficient state evidence regard use negative pressure wound therapy treatment acute chronic wound exist . This study evaluate treatment outcome application technical medical device , base principle negative pressure wound therapy ( treatment group 1 : Intervention Group ) comparison standard wound therapy ( treatment group 2 : Control group ) treatment chronic foot wound adequate ( debridement avital tissue ) wound preparation amputation wound result schedule amputation ankle ( talocrural articulation ) , cause context diabetic foot syndrome . The clinical trial design national , multicenter , prospective , randomize control superiority study . A blinded evaluation wound photograph perform . Patients randomize 1:1 treatment arm : negative pressure wound therapy control arm : standard wound therapy . Patients stratify accord assignment participate institution ( hospital ) Wagner-Armstrong Stadium . The inclusion exclusion criterion base presence diagnosis diabetic foot wound , regulatory requirement participant clinical study examination treatment accord current treatment regulation , evidence-based guideline specification manufacturer medical device . Only patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion allow included trial . The aim study compare clinical , safety economic result treatment arm . The primary endpoint evaluate efficacy negative pressure wound therapy treatment chronic foot wound cause diabetic foot syndrome number complete wound closure within maximum treatment period ( measured day ) well time complete wound closure . Complete wound closure achieve within maximum study treatment period 16 week . In addition , secondary clinical endpoint safety endpoint , patient-reported outcome endpoint health economic endpoint evaluate . The clinical examination include parameter use analysis resource use inpatient outpatient care . This include comparative analysis parameter direct indirect resource use . Primarily perspective Statutory Health Insurance consider . As secondary perspective view society select . Sample size calculation perform consider result exist trial , reveal number n = 324 patient must include study order carry analysis primary endpoint `` Closure rate '' . In due consideration screen failure , discontinuation therapy cause loss Follow-Up screen total 464 patient must perform provide calculated sample size.The primary efficacy analysis perform use intention-to-treat group . Study result provide end 2015 contribute final decision Federal Joint Committee Germany regard general admission negative pressure wound therapy standard performance within medical sector .</detailed_description>
