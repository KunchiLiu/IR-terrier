	<brief_summary>The common congenital heart disease ventricular septal defect , surgical closure defect , arrythmia call right bundle branch block , frequent . Therefore aim study investigate group patient inferior outcome compare group without arrythmia surgical closure compare group healthy control subject . All patient undergo 1. exercise testing , 2. echocardiography , 3. echocardiography exercise , 4 . MRI . The perspective ability point group patient possible need intervention , additionally increase awareness protect electrical system heart operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Bundle Branch Block After Surgical Closure Ventricular Septal Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Right bundle branch block exceedingly frequent complication heart surgery , especially patient undergone surgical closure ventricular septal defect common congenital heart disease . How bundle branch block effect right ventricle heart long-term basis group patient , still unknown . As part PhD-study therefore try illustrate echocardiography , MRI , exercise test investigation 15 20 year surgical procedure . The study population thus consist three different group : 1 . Patients undergone surgical closure ventricular septal defect without postoperative right bundle branch block , 2 . VSD-operated patient right bundle branch block 3 . Healthy control significant medical issue match age sex . By carry test mention right ventricle systolic function , diastolic function , patient maximal exercise capacity lot parameter evaluate three group patient compare amongst . The perspective therefore ability point specific group patient inferior outcome possible need intervention . An additional perspective increase awareness protect bundle branch operation .</detailed_description>
