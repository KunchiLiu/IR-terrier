	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose Akt inhibitor MK2206 together hydroxychloroquine treat patient advance solid tumor , melanoma , prostate kidney cancer . Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , hydroxychloroquine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 together hydroxychloroquine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Hydroxychloroquine Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors , Melanoma , Prostate Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) use combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine side effect activity MK-2206 hydroxychloroquine use combination . II . To determine hydroxychloroquine alters pharmacokinetics MK-2206 due drug-drug interaction . III . To validate biomarkers autophagy detection . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Akt inhibitor MK-2206 . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive hydroxychloroquine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
