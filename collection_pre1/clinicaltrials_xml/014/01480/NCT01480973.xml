	<brief_summary>NSCLC lead cause cancer mortality North America , account nearly 30 % cancer death . The standard treatment patient early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) surgical resection involve lobe/lung . However , many patient unable undergo major surgery due medical illness , emerge standard-of-care patient stereotactic-body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . SBRT involve highly precise delivery high dose Radiotherapy ( RT ) fraction ( hypofractionation ) accurately describe , size-restricted malignant target motion account delivery process . SBRT administration achieve avoidance normal tissue exposure radiation planning process , provide sharp fall-off dose gradient outside target .</brief_summary>

On followup thoracic CT scan , patient must change previously target lung parenchyma fit one follow three pattern : Changes CT clinical ground felt related fibrosis Changes CT clinical ground suspicious recurrence Equivocal change ( uncertain whether change represent fibrosis recurrence ) Must great 18 year age Must able attend regular followup include radiologic investigation clinical visit Written inform consent Standard contraindication MRI study ( e.g . ferromagnetic prosthesis , pacemaker/implanted defibrillator , metallic implant eye , severe claustrophobia , etcâ€¦ ) Contraindications Gadolinium contrastagent . May include history allergic reaction follow previous administration gadolinium poor renal function ( calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ) . Patients surgical resection treat portion lung follow SBRT , although surgical resection part lung allow .</criteria>
