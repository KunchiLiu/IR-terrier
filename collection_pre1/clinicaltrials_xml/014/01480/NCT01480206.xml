	<brief_summary>As endovascular procedure become complex , grow need 3D image overlay assist device guidance placement . Currently , 3D image typically create intra-operatively use 3D rotational angiography ( 3D-RA ) cone-beam CT ( XperCT ) . This 3D image may overlay live fluoroscopy provide 3D guidance information ( Dynamic 3D Roadmapping ) . Philips Healthcare multimodality overlay product allow registration pre-acquired MR/CT 3D rotational image live fluoroscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endovascular treatment perform guidance X-ray angiography system . Fluoroscopy conventional 2D digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) use navigate interventional device ( implant ) across lesion achieve correct bridging diseased region vessel , exclude involvement patent vessel . Drawbacks peripheral intervention include radiation dose , use contrast , need clinician excellent wire-handling skill . The use 2D image alone may enough describe three-dimensional ( 3D ) relationship interventional device ( implant ) complex vascular anatomy , often make position , deployment evaluation suboptimal . In addition , endovascular approach lead complication in-stent thrombosis type II endoleak ( case aortic aneurysm ) 2D image along sub-optimal re-intervention planning guidance . As endovascular procedure become complex , grow need 3D image overlay assist device guidance placement . Currently , 3D image typically create intra-operatively use 3D rotational angiography ( 3D-RA ) cone-beam CT ( XperCT ) . This 3D image may overlay live fluoroscopy provide 3D guidance information ( Dynamic 3D Roadmapping ) . 3D navigation also acquire registration pre-acquired MR/CT 3D rotational image live fluoroscopy .</detailed_description>
