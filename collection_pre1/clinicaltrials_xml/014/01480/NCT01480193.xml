	<brief_summary>Tinnitus common problem universally effective treatment . The best available estimate indicate 10 - 15 % adult report tinnitus symptom , 20 % report tinnitus suffer subsequently seek treatment . Only formally report U.S. Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) , economic impact tinnitus think substantial . The VA report 2004 289,159 veteran receive disability award tinnitus amount total annual compensation amount $ 345.5 million . Individuals persistent severe tinnitus unable habituate tinnitus sound likely originate central auditory system ( CAS ) response peripheral injury . In widely reference study , hypothesize lack habituation secondary abnormal process sensory information . Specifically , process limbic system autonomic nervous system apparently abnormal patient increase level cortical arousal inadequate coping mechanism . In otolaryngology audiology clinic , 'sound-based educational therapy ' ( SBE ) focus current therapy , utilize enhance sound input CAS . While SBE treatment may well provide start point tinnitus treatment , additional treatment option necessary particularly significant non-auditory aspect tinnitus ( e.g. , anxiety , depression , interference daily life ) well experience significant improvement SBE . Furthermore , commonly use form SBE [ e.g. , Tinnitus Retraining Therapy ( TRT ) ] require year become effective may use patient hear poor modify sound input . Based prevalence data tinnitus sufferer seek treatment know percentage respond commonly use therapy , estimate 1.2 million individual able benefit current , widely use treatment strategy . A new strategy augment currently use could empower patient exert control tinnitus symptom without use medication , expensive device Neuromonics device , extend program TRT . An alternative strategy may useful patient candidate SBE respond poorly . An Integrative Medicine approach provide likely solution . To date , systematic study benefit Integrative Medicine approach severe tinnitus , particularly non-auditory aspect tinnitus symptom . The goal propose study determine integrative medicine approach target treatment nonauditory aspect tinnitus suffer effective alleviate tinnitus symptom add current commonly apply SBE therapy , compare SBE alone . If successful , approach apply large patient population future study test generalizability durability effect . Our eventual goal develop streamline approach individualizes tinnitus treatment base symptom patient characteristic , widely apply general medical practice .</brief_summary>
