	<brief_summary>It expect addition anti-CD20 antibody - ofatumumab would enhance activity etoposide+ifosphamide mesna+cytarabine+methotrexate+lenograstim filgrastim ( IVAC ) regimen . This study plan determine efficacy safety ofatumumab combination IVAC chemotherapy patient CD20 positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma progress relapse prior R-CHOP chemotherapy suitable Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ( ASCT ) .</brief_summary>
