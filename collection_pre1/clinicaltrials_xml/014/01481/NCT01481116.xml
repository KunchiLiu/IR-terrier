	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety TAK-875 Compared Glimepiride When Used With Metformin Participants With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) increase dramatically throughout world past decade despite availability several different treatment option . Current pharmacologic treatment include insulin , thiazolidinediones , sulfonylurea , metformin , dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) mimetics . A number treatment associate clinically important side effect low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) , weight gainflud retention , exaggeration pre-existent heart failure , gastrointestinal side effect . These side effect disadvantage associate many currently available antidiabetic agent reduce compliance limit long-term use . Insulin hormone produce body regulate blood sugar ( glucose ) . In individual T2DM , insulin produce body effectively control amount sugar bloodstream . If properly manage , T2DM may cause elevate blood sugar level ( hyperglycemia ) ultimately result serious health problem . In response problem , Takeda develop TAK-875 ( investigational drug ) addition diet exercise improve blood sugar control patient T2DM . TAK-875 may affect production insulin may improve body use sugar blood . The aim study find TAK-875 , take approximately 2 year combination current diabetes medicine ( call metformin ) , safe effective help people T2DM control high blood sugar compare glimepiride ( type medication call sulfonylurea ) . The study do find combination TAK-875 plus metformin work well combination glimepiride plus metformin . Approximately 2430 patient worldwide age 18 T2DM , take part study involve study 110 120 week . TAK-875 develop Takeda Global Research Development , Inc. adjunct diet exercise improve glycemic control participant T2DM . This study investigate TAK-875 participant type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar level inadequately control metformin monotherapy . Due potential concern liver safety , balance , benefit treat patient fasiglifam ( TAK-875 ) outweigh potential risk . For reason , Takeda decide voluntarily terminate development activity fasiglifam .</detailed_description>
