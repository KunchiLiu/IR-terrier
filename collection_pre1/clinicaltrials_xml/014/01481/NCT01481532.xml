	<detailed_description>Crotoxin show induce neurotoxic tolerance animal allow receive high dos associate effective anti-tumor activity absence adverse side effect . The study plan demonstrate effect human subject use two dose escalation protocol ; slow fast . It believe approach prevent toxic side effect subject . The route administration employ clinically design avoid myonecrotic effect intramuscular injection . The target maximum dose almost double previously report MTD . The protocol also incorporate active suppression allergic reaction pre-treatment administration antihistamine .</detailed_description>
