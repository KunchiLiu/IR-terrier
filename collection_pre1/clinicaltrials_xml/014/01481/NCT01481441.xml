	<brief_summary>With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound ( CEUS ) cancer induce neovascularisation visualise potential improve ultrasound image prostate cancer detection localisation significantly . The past year numerous study perform CEUS , base result subjective judgement investigator . CEUS image interpretation difficult require well-trained expert . To overcome difficulty CEUS quantification technique use . The technique use protocol developed cooperation Technical University Eindhoven ( TU/e ) BRACCO , Geneva . The investigator hypothesize improvement PCa detection rate quantification , compare subjective CEUS interpretation know number literature . Also comparison quantification result tumour differentiation grade ( Gleason score ) make , investigator hypothesize positive correlation .</brief_summary>
