	<brief_summary>Influenza serious disease cause severe illness even death among patient . Health care worker ( HCWs ) often get infect influenza 76 % keep working ill. Immunizing HCWs therefore essential factor protect patient influenza HCWs easily transmit influenza patient . However , despite recommendation Dutch Health Council since 2007 , vaccine uptake among HCWs remain low . The aim study develop effective implementation strategy basis previous behavioural study evaluate value cluster randomized trial Dutch University Medical Centers ( UMCs ) . Also , want assess program element associate high vaccine uptake cost-effectiveness implementation strategy . The result study give insight way influenza vaccination campaign direct order achieve high vaccine uptake rate among HCWs hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Influenza Vaccination Implementation Strategy Hospital Health Care Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since influenza vaccination rate among hospital HCWs low , developed implementation program test large target group . The primary objective evaluate short- long-term effect multi-faceted implementation program improve influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs hospital two influenza season . Its clinical effect assess mean randomize controlled trial select division ( e.g . internal medicine , pediatric ward ) six randomize UMCs Netherlands . Secondary aims ass program element associate high vaccine uptake among target group evaluate cost-effectiveness program . The program develop use Intervention Mapping method take account evidence systematic literature review questionnaire study among HCWs UMCs part measurement ( 2008 ) . The Intervention Mapping method theoretical framework develop field health education promotion systematically design theory evidence base health promotion program . In 2008 , select five division UMCs take part trial . Before measurement show wide variation uptake ( &lt; 15-50 % ) 11 determinant explain 95 % vaccination behaviour . Three UMCs adopt intervention develop research group use Intervention Mapping method , three UMCs serve control . The current implemented program UMCs vary widely range passive information system involvement Board Directors . Our intervention exist multi-faceted program aim HCWs management division . Our primary outcome record vaccine uptake among HCWs UMCs . To evaluate short-term long-term process program , web-based questionnaire develop direct health care worker select division UMCs . The questionnaire contain question vaccine uptake HCWs ' opinion influenza , vaccination vaccination campaign . Absenteeism also register . Finally , patient data collect participate division UMCs order investigate relationship vaccinate HCWs morbidity mortality patient influenza .</detailed_description>
