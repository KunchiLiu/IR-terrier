	<brief_summary>Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) serious neurological condition characterise acute subacute brain injury arise perinatal hypoxia . HIE think affect approximately 0.2 % live birth , associate high risk mortality long-term neurological disability . Accurate biomarkers long-term neuro-developmental outcome follow HIE extremely important clinical management evaluation therapeutic approach . According recent meta-analysis , ratio cerebral concentration lactate N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) , two neuro-metabolites detectable magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , currently represent accurate prognostic indicator outcome follow HIE . However , various technical reason standard MRS method offer optimal sensitivity detect lactate , may potentially improve custom lactate edit MRS sequence . In addition , perfusion also suggest potential biomarker neuro-developmental outcome follow HIE , due paucity MR perfusion image study neonate , prognostic accuracy perfusion MR measure evaluate comparison establish MR biomarkers . The aim study : 1. evaluate relative sensitivity custom lactate edit MRS pulse sequence ( specialist software ) relative standard point resolve ( PRESS ) MRS sequence detect lactate neonate suspect HIE . 2. evaluate sensitivity specificity MR perfusion measure comparison MRS measure predictor neuro-developmental outcome 2 year .</brief_summary>
