	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy high-intensity non invasive mechanical ventilation ( one year reduce severity frequency acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) patient frequent AECOPD ( frequent exacerbation define two AECOPD ) GOLD IV stage ( severe COPD ) . The design randomise , double blind control placebo ( sham maneuver ) clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exacerbation Prevention GOLD IV COPD With Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - There many previous study ( control trial observational study ) demonstrate minimal benefit ( gas exchange marginal effect exacerbation frequency ) use non invasive mechanical ventilation , BiPAP modality IPAP pressure &lt; 18H2ocm ( low intensity ) , COPD patient . - In subsequent year control trial conclude benefit use non invasive mechanical ventilation BiPAP mode COPD patient ( It mention trial use low inspiratory pressure level , call low-intensity non invasive mechanical ventilation ) . - However , recent study describe benefit high intensity Bilevel modality non invasive mechanical ventilation ( inspiratory pressure &gt; 18cmH2O ) specially gas exchange , quality life functional status . - There issue yet clear answer like optimal inspiratory pressure ( IPAP ) ventilation modality ( BIPAP ) obtain maximal benefit COPD patient . Additionally , clear also use non invasive mechanical ventilation COPD patient help reduce frequency severity acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) . This study characteristic different previous report : - The inclusion patient frequent exacerbation phenotype ( therefore bad prognosis patient ) include previous trial - The intervention maneuver bilevel modality non invasive mechanical ventilation hig-intensity pressure ( &gt; 18H2Ocm &lt; 24H2Ocm ) - The use placebo maneuver ( CPAP `` Sham '' ) - The home titration three phase , week - The long-term use intervention sham maneuver</detailed_description>
