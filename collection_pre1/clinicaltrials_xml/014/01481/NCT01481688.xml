	<brief_title>Enhancing Dialysis Adequacy : Effects Intradialytic Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient severe chronic kidney disease , regular dialysis remove toxins waste product blood essential maintain life . The adequacy dialysis quantify removal toxic solute important parameter assessment therapy . Previous effort enhance urea clearance center around factor increase dialysis dose increase dialysis time carry frequent dialysis session . However concept confront barrier patient compliance cost implication . Many patient resilient increase dialysis time , present major challenge enhance efficacy dialysis therapy . Therefore , alternative method improve dialysis adequacy , intervention aim enhance solute clearance , highly warrant . One intervention could exercise haemodialysis ( HD ) . 85 % body comprised lean tissue , 73 % water . As many toxic solute water base , large amount store muscle . When sit rest HD blood flow muscle four time less compare major organ . Additionally , HD process cause blood vessel constrict , restrict blood flow muscle . Consequently insufficient blood flow remove toxin store muscle . By exercise dialysis , blood flow muscle increase sustain demand oxygen energy , thereby allow toxic solute remove cleared dialysis machine . Therefore aim study implement efficient exercise intervention dialysis determine effect dialysis adequacy comparison traditional prescription increase dialysis time . In particular , study aim explore acute effect exercise dialysis removal several establish uremic toxin .</detailed_description>
