	<brief_title>Performance Study New Media Vitrification Human Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center prospective sibling oocyte vitrification trial , first phase , half patient ' oocyte vitrify warm ( experimental group ) . The remain oocyte vitrify serve control group . In second phase patient ' oocyte vitrify embryo transfer perform following cycle . This simulate situation normal cryopreservation embryo transfer . The study population consist 20 woman undergo fresh IVF cycle study period . The primary objective first phase ass survival , fertilization embryo development oocyte vitrification/warming new medium . The result compare result sibling oocyte vitrify . Secondary objective assess clinical result implantation , miscarriage pregnancy rate well delivery rate neonatal outcome . The primary objective second phase assess delivery rate oocyte vitrification/warming new medium . Secondary objective assess survival , fertilization , embryo development , utilization rate , pregnancy rate neonatal outcome previously vitrify warmed oocyte . The result compare result control group patient , treat clinic within time period , use inclusion exclusion criterion . All patient undergo embryo transfer serum beta-hCG test conduct 14 day oocyte retrieval . If positive , repeat beta-hCG testing conduct 2-4 day later . If appropriate , pregnancy ultrasound conduct 6-8 week gestation ( menstrual age ) record gestational sac ( ) fetal heart beat . The delivery outcome also record . For patient unsuccessful treatment , follow-up period 6 month study completion . From follow-up , data freeze cycle , i.e . embryo oocyte vitrification , evaluate well .</detailed_description>
