	<detailed_description>Introduction : In low-income setting develop country unsafe water one leading cause high prevalence waterborne diseases diarrhoea . Point-of-use water treatment system currently consider UNICEF effective delivering safe drinking water intervention apply source . Zinc essential trace element critical role growth immunity . Supplementation zinc consider effective reduce morbidity diarrhoeal infectious disease . Verstergaard Frandsen S.A. ( Switzerland ) develop point-of-use water filtration system call LifeStraw®Family ( LSF ) remove water 's turbidity , reduce microbiological contamination enriches water zinc concentration 3.5 mg/L . Objective : To assess efficacy LSF increase zinc status ( serum zinc concentration ) intake Kenyan child age 2-5years zinc deficiency . Study Design Methods : A study population live area low Zn status share unimproved water supply include trial randomly assign one treatment group 12 month . All household receive hygiene practice recommendation ( HPRs ) . In addition HPR , group one receive LSF device zinc delivery system ; group 2 receive HPRs LSF without zinc delivery system , group 3 receive HPRs . At baseline , mid-point end-point , anthropometrics ( weight , height , mid-upper arm circumference MUAC ) , 7 ml whole blood collect preschool child determination SZn , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , hemoglobin ( Hb ) serum ferritin ( SF ) . Children adult subject remain zinc deficient completion trial receive zinc supplement . Expected outcome : This study investigate efficacy water treatment device mean provide Zn community high prevalence surface water use zinc deficiency coexists . Increasing microbiological quality water contemporaneous low dose fortification zinc , could prove useful global effort control zinc deficiency increase supply clean drinking water</detailed_description>
