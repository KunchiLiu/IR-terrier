	<brief_title>Anticipative Diagnosis Central Venous Catheter Related Bloodstream Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management patient hematologic malignancy , renal failure diseases require intensive care often necessitate use central venous catheter ( CVC ) . Beside obvious advantage CVCs bear great risk local systemic infection . In US estimate 250 000 catheter-related blood stream infection ( CRBSIs ) occur year mortality rate 12-25 % . Diagnosis CRBSIs remain challenge systemic clinical sign unspecific local sign infection often absent . Conventional method diagnose CRBSIs require removal CVC . However , 15 % CVCs remove patient clinical suspicion CRBSI prove infect . It show CRBSI also detect differential time positivity ( DTP ) method without catheter removal . The Gram stain/acridine-orange leukocyte cytospin ( AOLC ) test PNA FISH test another method diagnosis CRBSI require removal CVC additionally show fast . Up date method diagnosis CRBSI perform CRBSI clinically suspect . Thus , patient may actually suffer CRBSI risk concurrently suffer develop complication like endocarditis septic embolism diagnostic procedure detection CRBSI introduce . Since CRBSIs entirely preventable strict hygiene measure earlier diagnosis CRBSI subclinical stage desirable avoid CRBSI-associated morbidity mortality . Previously pilot study show Gram stain/AOLC screen CVCs neutropenic patient useful test predict development CRBSI average 48 hour diagnosis establish routine measure . In pilot study Gram stain/AOLC screen test exhibit high specificity whereas sensitivity moderate . PNA FISH specific slide-based staining technique provide pathogen identification blood sample contain give amount bacteria fungi within 1,5 hour . PNA FISH test slightly low detection limit compare Gram stain/AOLC might therefore result high sensitivity use screen tool . The aim project investigate sensitive specific test anticipative diagnosis CRBSI use biphasic PNA FISH test compare Gram stain/AOLC test .</detailed_description>
