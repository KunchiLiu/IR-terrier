	<brief_summary>The overall purpose study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics preliminary efficacy five-days post-operative course Treprostinil liver transplant patient . The hypothesis study Treprostinil safely administer post-operatively liver transplant patient . Once safety document future study address ability ameliorate prevent reperfusion mediate dysfunction liver graft thereby reduce morbidity , lead short hospital stay compare historical control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostaglandin-class drug , include prostacyclin analog , could represent important advance toward goal reduce transplant relate morbidity , mortality associate cost minimize effect ischemia perfusion injury liver graft . Additionally , reduction serum creatinine reduce need post operative dialysis observe study implication protect kidney nephrotoxic affect immunosuppressant agent , especially early post-operative period . Routine use prostaglandin ( PGE1 PGI2 ) , however , limited instability short half life . Treprostinil , prostanoid ( prostacyclin analog ) , expect facilitate restoration blood supply revascularized graft provide well-characterized protective effect class compound liver transplant patient . Treprostinil advantage long elimination half-life prostanoids previously test patient . Treprostinil expect significantly protect graft ischemia perfusion injury . This pilot study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics preliminary efficacy Treprostinil orthotopic liver transplant patient first step evaluate use prevention ischemia reperfusion injury graft liver .</detailed_description>
