	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor activity Akt inhibitor MK2206 ( MK2206 ) term objective response rate ( ORR ) 4 month ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] ) per 2007 International Cheson response criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor activity MK2206 term ORR 4 month ( CR , unconfirmed complete response [ CRu ] , PR ) per 1999 International Cheson response criterion . II . To determine duration response , define time date best response date progression . III . To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient . IV . To determine safety MK2206 . V. To identify predictive biomarkers treatment outcome . ( exploratory ) VI . To conduct pharmacodynamic study use FDG-PET scan . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
