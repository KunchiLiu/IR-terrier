	<detailed_description>SUSAC 's Syndrome ( SS ) characterize clinical triad encephalopathy , hear loss , retinal artery branch occlusion . Since first description SS 1979 , hundreds patient SS , mostly young woman , report . However , comprehensive epidemiological , clinical etiological feature SS never specifically address far . The diagnosis SS difficult characteristic sign often occur simultaneously may subtle patient notice . Neurological feature SS may occur several month prior symptom . The retinal artery branch occlusion , occur peripheral portion retina , may remain asymptomatic . Sensorineural hearing loss may also asymptomatic disclosed audiogram . Besides mild pleocytosis cerebrospinal fluid , perform biological test virtually negative . No infectious agent , consistent autoimmune marker , coagulopathy disclose . Changes see brain MRI well characterize although specific . The site biopsy material available pathological analysis brain . The common finding brain biopsy presence microinfarcts brain biopsy currently perform . Although treatment SS study control trial , patient good response treatment glucocorticoid , addition anti-thrombotic therapy , case disease refractory steroid , intravenous immune globulin cyclophosphamide . The clinical course characterize recurrent attack involve 1 component triad characterize active phase disease . Remission usually occur active phase patient show residual mild moderate dementia gait disturbance , impair hearing vision . SUSAC 's Syndrome vasculopathy cause small infarct cochlea , retina brain . Proposed explanation include hypercoagulable state , vasospasm , vasculitis , none support laboratory result finding brain biopsy . The unique distribution arteriolar disease affect brain , retina , cochlea suggest selective vulnerability three structure . The brain , retina , cochlea blood-tissue barrier , endothelium site share common embryologic origin unique structural antigenic characteristic . It therefore propose SS autoimmune disease endothelium primary target , damage endothelium trigger arteriolar occlusion microinfarcts . However , pathogenesis remain unknown . The objective study characterize epidemiological , clinical , etiological feature SUSAC 's Syndrome . In aim , constitute national clinical-based cohort include SS case retrospectively report France since last 20 year new case prospectively observe . French Society Neurology , Ophthalmology Internal Medicine ask collaborate . Every case review expert comity internist , neurologist neuroradiologists validate diagnosis . The exhaustive systematic analysis case help good define different aspect disease incidence prevalence , clinical presentation , diagnostic modality impact treatment . Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image brain obtain carefully study cerebral microvasculopathy disease . Serum , cerebrospinal fluid , DNA sample patient also collect study potential autoimmune , thrombotic infectious marker . Because SUSAC 's syndrome rare disease , expect include one hundred patient cohort . The constitution cohort collection sample last 2 year half . The conclusion study , base statistical analysis do patient include cohort , allow new recommendation diagnosis strategy give new understanding therapeutic management disease . The result study may also give rise hypothesis interventional study . It 's important underline study must consider interventional study . Indeed , study patient specific MRI , acquisition sequence diffusion tensor . While common practice patient classical MRI without specific sequence routinely technique use .</detailed_description>
