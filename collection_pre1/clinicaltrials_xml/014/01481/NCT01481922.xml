	<brief_summary>This study intend help guide choice needle diameter perform lumbar puncture . Smaller spinal needle show decrease rate adverse event post-lumbar puncture headache hearing loss . The main drawback use small needle diminish flow rate ; textbook recommend use needle small 22 gauge slow flow rate though others recommend small needle , namely 22-24 gauge . Some author describe successful use spinal needle small 25 gauge perform lumbar puncture . The investigator believe flow-rate difference 22 24 gauge needle significant enough justify use large needle . The investigator trial compare Whitacre 22 gauge Whitacre 24 gauge needle flow rate , incidence know complication pain procedure backache 8 15 day post-procedure . The investigator also look whether small needle associate less pain procedure less backache next 2 week procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>What Needle Diameter Should Physician Use When They Perform Lumbar Puncture ? A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize , double-blinded clinical trial ass whether 24 gauge spinal needle provide acceptable flow rate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) compare traditionally use 22 gauge needle . Smaller needle , accord The Therapeutics Technology Assessment Subcommittee American Academy Neurology 'associated reduced frequency post-lumbar puncture headache ( Level A recommendation ) . ' Given flow rate CSF limit factor choose spinal needle gauge , two previous study compare various needle size adequacy flow . These study , however , important limitation lead clear consensus clinical practice . For instance , one study use 0,9 % solution sodium chloride room temperature , use 'artificial CSF solution ' unknown viscosity nature . Patients refer neurological day center Montreal Neurological Institute/Hospital lumbar puncture recruit study . Participants randomized puncture Whitacre 22 24 gauge needle .</detailed_description>
