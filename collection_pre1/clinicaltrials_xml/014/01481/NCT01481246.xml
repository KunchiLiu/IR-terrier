	<brief_summary>The Neurocognitive Study Aging ( NEUROAGE ) initially fund Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation receive subsequent funding European Union Regional Development Fund . The project focus understanding effect age neurocognitive ability attention , memory , language , categorization , executive functioning . In addition , also investigate effect theory-driven hierarchical training program , Categorization Program , improve cognitive ability adult Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Over 700 adult age 50 older participate project . The grant award University Cyprus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given fact old adult expect live long maintain social professional activity , development effective cognitive retraining methodology design maximize independence interest . In addition change cause normal age process , old adult 70 high risk develop dementia . About 8-12 % old adult population demonstrate pre-dementia syndrome refer Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) consider prodrome dementia . Consequently , important identify variable contribute development MCI well neurocognitive therapy approach help patient improve level functioning . Categorization one fundamental cognitive process . The ability divide world discrete category rudimentary process begin early life continue develop refine across lifespan . This underlying process crucial variety neurocognitive ability include attention memory influence vocational educational reintegration . Normal age result categorization deficit turn interfere individual 's ability attend , remember , organize information . This difficulty could hamper activity daily live , social participation , independence . This project implement innovative treatment program base current theoretical model human cognition design improve neurocognitive ability . The primary objective project provide evidence effectiveness systematic hierarchical neurocognitive therapy method , Categorization Program ( CP ) adult MCI normal old adult . It hypothesize CP effective treatment approach improve categorization ability group subject . The following activity take place : 1 . First , population-based sample 500 old adult test use battery neuropsychological measure . Normal old adult reassess two year ; individual indication MCI assess determine presence MCI . 2 . Second , normal OA adult MCI randomly assign either treat untreated group . The treated group receive CP training order test effectiveness . 3 . Third , long term effect cognitive retrain 1 year post treatment assess . 4 . Finally , project examine relationship categorization task , neuropsychological performance , functional outcome measure , subject characteristic include health index , education , biomarkers . The long-term objective research program determine variable influence cognitive decline older adult develop effective neurocognitive therapy technique .</detailed_description>
