	<brief_summary>An excellent bowel cleanse mandatory increase diagnostic accuracy colonoscopy . Failure adequately cleanse bowel colonoscopy lead miss lesion , prolonged procedure duration repeat procedure earlier interval . Emerging solid evidence point need switch preparation day regimens half even preparation administer day procedure , extensively demonstrate provide significantly well cleansing , well tolerate . Preparation fully administer day afternoon procedure , whereas split-dose regimen fit good morning colonoscopy . However , ideal regimen early morning colonoscopy still elucidate . The second part preparation patient usually recommend take sleeping time ( 2-3 ) belief intake fluid completely halt least four hour prior colonoscopy procedure Sodium picosulphate unique orange-flavoured cleansing agent dose two powder sachet . Mayor advantage comparison current alternative relatively small volume ( sachet mixed 150-250 mL water ) pleasant taste . It provide similar bowel cleanse sodium phosphate polyethylene glycol solution administer day . Nonetheless , focus split-dose regimen set several polyethylene glycol ( either high-volume low-volume ) regimens , data available split-dose sodium-picosulphate regard colonoscopy adult . The aim study evaluate efficacy safety sodium-picosulphate low-volume split-dose regimen , second-half preparation fluid intake allow 2 hour early morning colonoscopy 2-6 hour morning colonoscopy , compare split-dose regimen standard cleanse day sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Justification study : Several split-dose bowel cleanse regimen raise last decade aim substitute standard preparation day . These split-dose regimen ( base sodium phosphate polyethylene glycol solution ) demonstrate well cleanse score , probably important time preparation give rather type solution . However , time administer second half solution split-dose regimen morning colonoscopy remain controversial . A major concern split-dose regimen risk aspiration pneumonia sedation liquid administer quite close procedure . As , second part preparation usually give early morning ( 2-3 ) order safety-period least four hour prior colonoscopy . However , quite disturb patient may hamper adherence colonoscopy . Furthermore , On hand , study address role split-dose Citrafleet publish date Therefore necessary make control clinical trial directly compare `` day '' `` split-dose '' regimens Citrafleet morning colonoscopy . In order maximize efficacy split-dose regimen , time period fluid intake colonoscopy shorten 2 hour morning colonoscopy schedule 9 11 3 hour schedule 11 . The result study conclude whether still room improvement bowel cleanse morning colonoscopy , use palatable low-volume solution without interrupt sleep time .</detailed_description>
