	<brief_summary>The endoscopic management patient anti platelet agent wide problem common , prevalence patient type therapy steadily increase . The risk bleed antiplatelet endoscopic examination major . The risk cardiovascular thrombotic accident dirty shutdown anti platelet , recently describe significant ( 4-5 % ) . Current recommendation polypectomy allow gesture aspirin base literature data scarce , often retrospective . Such work may lack increase bleeding risk colonic polypectomy aspirin . There date significant data publish implementation endoscopic mucosal resection ( mucosectomy ) aspirin . It necessary achieve national multicenter observational study large scale daily practice colonic polypectomy / mucosectomy patient take aspirin . The aim study determine incidence immediate delay bleeding colonic polypectomy mucosectomy aspirin . The patient undergoing colonoscopy take long-term aspirin therapy present major risk thromboembolism medium incluables . Inclusion achieve patient receive aspirin colonoscopy sign specific consent . Polypectomy possible accord recommendation French Society Digestive Endoscopy . Upon discovery lesion resect mucosectomy , patient benefit mucosectomy . The study observational , multicenter , prospective , national . The polypectomy / colonic mucosectomies make use conventional technique current recommendation . The immediate delayed hemorrhage meet specific definitional criterion . The number patient include 1000 . The duration study inclusion 36 month . The trial conduct full compliance law , regulation ethical aspect . It expect work incidence post-polypectomy bleeding aspirin . The rate bleeding report post mucosectomy size high compare polypectomy : however expect rate bleed post mucosectomy without aspirin indifferent . It follow recommendation French society adapt endoscopy type procedure</brief_summary>
