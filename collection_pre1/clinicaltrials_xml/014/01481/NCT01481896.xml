	<brief_summary>This retrospective study review Anderson Orthopaedic Institute 's initial experience among consecutive series 126 patient primary total hip arthroplasty use metal-on-metal articulation consist DePuy Pinnacle cup Ultamet liner couple 36-mm cobalt-chrome alloy femoral head . The relationship metal ion level , cup orientation , osteolysis , radiographic implant stability clinical outcome measure include component revision , complication , patient satisfaction Harris Hip Scores evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metal-on-metal bearing total hip arthroplasty alternative traditional polyethylene bearing surface hip simulator study show metal-on-metal bearing low wear metal-on-polyethylene bearing . In addition , simulator study indicate amount wear decrease head size increase allow use large head diameter possible bearing surface . Since dislocation currently common reason reoperation United States , represent 22.5 % hip revision , combination low wear large head size reduce dislocation hold promise improve outcome among total hip arthroplasty patient . While potential advantage metal-on-metal bearing , concern note literature . Although total volume wear low bearing , articulation generates metal debris may relate patient surgical factor implant positioning . Despite reduced wear volume , also possibility increase bioreactivity associate metal debris might induce osteolytic response local tissue hypersensitivity reaction . This study retrospectively review outcome consecutive series 126 patient 131 primary THAs perform April 2001 November 2002 Anderson Clinic Pinnacle acetabular cup , Ultamet insert 36-mm cobalt-chrome alloy femoral head . These total hip arthroplasty represent Anderson Orthopaedic Institute 's initial experience implant . The relationship metal ion level , cup orientation , osteolysis , radiographic implant stability clinical outcome measure include component revision , complication , patient satisfaction Harris Hip Scores evaluate . The outcome data analysis also compare data publish series metal-on-metal bearing surface . Serial radiograph obtain part routine post-operative care use evaluate osteolysis , implant stability radiographic complication periprosthetic fracture . The area osteolytic region measure AP pelvic x-ray use Martell 's Hip Analysis Suite . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan obtain part routine follow-up also analyze identify region acetabular osteolysis . The volume location osteolytic defect identify CT evaluate use three-dimensional image analysis software ( Analyze , Biomedical Imaging Resource , Rochester , MN ) . A three-dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction pelvis , cup acetabular osteolytic lesion also generate CT image data . This reconstruction orient simulate AP pelvic radiographic view . Cobalt chromium ion level data compile patient blood drawn evaluate metal ion level . The mean median blood metal-ion level patient calculate result compare metal-ion level report literature .</detailed_description>
