	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether intravenous adenosine test readily identify patient unexplained syncope would benefit permanent pacemaker implantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adenosine Testing DEtermine Need Pacing Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation syncope ( transient loss consciousness loss postural tone , collapse spontaneous recovery ) vary widely , often lengthy frequently expensive . The intravenous adenosine test use investigation syncope cheap , safe free serious side effect . However , unclear diagnosis test unearths . There evidence test readily identify bradycardia pace indication . In study plan perform adenosine test implant pacemaker test positive . In half patient turn pacemaker `` '' half pacemaker `` '' . The group swap six month . During time assess number syncopal episode . Also , negative adenosine test implant loop recorder try discover cause syncope .</detailed_description>
