	<brief_title>Enhanced Room Cleaning Intensive Care Units Reduce Gown Glove Contamination With Multi-drug-resistant Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospital infection often cause bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ( MDRAB ) . Hospital infection increase cost health care , length hospital stay , mortality compare infection antibiotic-susceptible organism . Many antibiotic-resistant bacteria transmit patient-to-patient contact . Healthcare worker one possible vector patient-to-patient transmission . Transient colonization hand , clothe protective equipment lead colonization infection patient . The surface patient room also frequently contaminate antibiotic-resistant bacteria . A number recent study conclude patient room clean thoroughly frequently enough keep commonly touch surface free bacterial contamination . Given frequency contact healthcare worker patient 's environment , bacteria contaminate environmental surface patient room significant potential reservoir patient-to-patient transmission via hand healthcare worker . In study , investigator examine room intensive care unit patient colonize MRSA MDRAB . The investigator randomize room receive either standard room cleaning plus clean high-touch surface ( 'enhanced clean ' ) receive standard room cleaning plus sham cleaning high-touch surface ( 'sham enhance clean ' ) . The investigator culture healthcare worker ' disposable isolation gown gloves exit enrol room routine patient care activity . The investigator examine culture presence MRSA MDRAB determine whether additional cleaning significantly reduce proportion healthcare worker contaminate glove gown , therefore may reduce risk transmit bacteria patient . The result trial help guide future effort decrease patient-to-patient transmission antibiotic-resistant bacteria .</detailed_description>
