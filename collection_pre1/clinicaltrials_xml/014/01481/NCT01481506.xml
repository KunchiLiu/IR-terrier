	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) determine important risk disability disease-related need care . Selected intervention able reduce number severity exacerbation . Telemedicine also propose purpose . Current evidence , however , scant . The investigator present randomize , parallel-group trial multiparametric remote monitoring system test ability improve early exacerbation detection rate impact clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiparametric Telemonitoring In Elderly People With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient perform simple spirometry carry use Stead-Wells bell spirometer ( Biomedin , Padua , Italy ) . Upon provision inform consent , patient telemonitoring group invite session instruct wear wristband operate cellular telephone . A study physician available call office hour assist patient need instruction . A technician also available order solve ingoing hardware problem . All participant also clinically evaluated baseline receive multi-dimensional assessment include : Activities daily live scale ( ADL ) , Instrumental activity daily live scale ( IADL ) , Mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) test . These well validate routinely used tool screen geriatric patient order detect global , physical instrumental autonomy consequent degree dependence , well cognitive status . Patients group follow 9 month , period attend standard schedule clinical control . For patient SweetAge group , parameter receive evaluated daily study physician . In case abnormal reading , physician systematically contact patient verify whether symptom worsen new symptom arise . In event , patient 's adherence her/his therapy check , unsatisfactory , individually tailored intervention promote adherence carry . Otherwise , diagnosis exacerbation make , basis severity , outpatient clinical assessment ( mild exacerbation ) hospital admission schedule . The outcome measure study : number exacerbation ( define sustain worsen patient 's condition , stable state beyond normal day-to-day variation , acute onset necessitates change regular medication , number hospital admission .</detailed_description>
