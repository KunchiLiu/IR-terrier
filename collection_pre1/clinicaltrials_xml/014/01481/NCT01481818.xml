	<brief_summary>Radiodermatitis radiation mucositis frequent side-effect course radiotherapy , especially concurrent chemoradiotherapy apply . Since reactive oxygen specie form upon radiation therapy play central role initiate drive detrimental signal event , antioxidant supplementation think provide photoprotective effect radiation . Green tea extract show antioxidant anti-inflammatory effect various type cell . To evaluate safety efficiency green tea extract treatment radio dermatitis radiation mucositis , investigator conduct phase Ⅰ , II study use topical EGCG cancer patient receive radiotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Topically Applied Green Tea Extract Radio Dermatitis Radiation Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1 trial use EGCG prevention treatment radiodermatitis patient breast cancer . Patient selection criteria The eligible criterion include : ≥18 year old ; adequate renal hepatic function ; histological proven breast cancer ; receive adjuvant external electron beam RT chest wall ( without lymph node associate ) modify radical mastectomy ; receive least 50.0 Gy 25~28 fraction , deliver daily , 5d/week ; treatment plan use simulated locator patient supine position adequate immobilization . The exclusion criterion follow : previous RT chest wall and/or lymph node associate ; previous chemotherapy radiotherapy another neoplasia ; pregnancy lactation ; concomitant chemotherapy ; know allergy hypersensitivity EGCG . Treatment Protocol Patients instruct apply 0.01~0.05ml/cm2 EGCG 3 time day area treatment . The initial concentration 40μM , adjust previous study ( Katiyar SK , Afaq F , Perez A , Mukhtar H. Green tea polyphenol ( - ) -epigallocatechin-3-gallate treatment human skin inhibits ultraviolet radiation-induced oxidative stress . Carcinogenesis . 2001 ; 22 ( 2 ) :287-94 ) EGCG treatment begin cutaneous toxicity reach grade 1 , evaluate principal investigator patient 's radiation oncologist accord Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute skin toxicity scale.The duration EGCG treatment last least two week RT completion , use EGCG encourage . At per protocol , patient develop grade Ⅱ radiation-induced dermatitis option either withdraw study continue EGCG.Adverse event grade 1 attributed EGCG respond supportive care consider dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Transient toxicity grade 1 respond supportive care record adverse event consider dose limit . In general , grade 2 adverse event attribute EGCG , therapy hold symptom resolve ≤ grade 1 reinitiated along supportive care measure dose level . The maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) define dose level low dose induced DLT least one third patient ( least two six patient ) one cycle therapy . Acute skin toxicity evaluate use Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute skin toxicity scale principal investigator . The Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool use measure patient-reported discomfort . ( Berthelet E , Truong PT , Musso K , et al . Preliminary reliability validity test new Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool ( STAT ) breast cancer patient undergo radiotherapy . Am J Clin Oncol 2004 ; 27:626-631. ) . Statistical Analyses The primary outcome phase I trial number DLTs determination MTD , frequency severity radiodermatitis secondary outcome , frequency severity pain pruritus third outcome .</detailed_description>
