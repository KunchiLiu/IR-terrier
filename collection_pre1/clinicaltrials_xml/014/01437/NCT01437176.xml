	<brief_title>Treatment Intertrochanteric Fracture With New Type Intramedullary Nail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With progress age society , elderly patient intertrochanteric fracture occur . The best recommend treatment surgical treatment intramedullary fixation . However , exist method intramedullary fixation could restore integrated interior support , occur early hip varus . Meanwhile , varus deformity longer develop two end contact wach . This new intramedullary fixation device overcome exist shortage intramedullary fixation device support inside problem . It prompt fracture site obtain strong initial stability , improve fracture heal rate , reduce incidence varus allow patient early weight-bearing walking . This new type intramedullary fixation intertrochanteric fracture device , include proximal femoral anatomy adapt proximal femoral nail , proximal femoral nail femoral head distal femur compression screw lock screw , main feature : 1 . The proximal femoral nail make titanium , proximal part narrow inside wide outside structure . It look like trapezoidal cross-section . This device match anatomy proximal femur mechanical reliability . 2 . The tip compression screw design thread . It come intramedullary nail , produce slide sustain pressure . 3 . The femoral support screw make cylindrical , blunt round tip . The tip femoral support screw table groove compression screw . This design support interior mechanical stability . At time , support screw femoral head neck compression screw slide fine-tuning , direct offset varus femoral neck rotate shift prevent secondary loss fracture reduction . The screw femoral head also prevent cut occurs . 4 . This device use minimally invasive approach percutaneous implant body . Reduce reduction time , fracture interference help natural healing fracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men woman age 18 year old ( upper age limit ) . Fracture intertrochanteric fracture confirm either anteroposterior lateral hip radiograph , compute tomography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Operative treatment fracture within 14 day present emergency room . Patient ambulatory prior fracture , though may use aid cane walker . Anticipated medical optimalization operative fixation hip . Provision inform consent patient legal guardian . No major trauma . Patients suitable internal fixation ( i.e. , severe osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , pathologic fracture ) . Associated major injury low extremity ( i.e. , ipsilateral contralateral fracture foot , ankle , tibia , fibula , knee , femur ; dislocation ankle , knee , hip ; femoral head defect fracture ) . Retained hardware around affected hip . Infection around hip ( i.e. , soft tissue bone ) . Patients disorder bone metabolism except osteoporosis ( i.e. , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , osteomalacia ) . Moderate severe cognitively impaired patient ( i.e. , Six Item Screener 3 error ) . Patients Parkinson 's disease ( dementia ) severe enough increase likelihood fall severe enough compromise rehabilitation . Likely problem , judgment investigator , maintain followup . We , example , exclude patient fixed address , report plan move town next year , intellectually challenge patient without adequate family support</criteria>
