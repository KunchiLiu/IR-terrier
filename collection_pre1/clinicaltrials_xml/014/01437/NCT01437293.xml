	<brief_title>Behavioral Physiological Effects Cocaine Cocaine-dependent Participants Treated With Levodopa Combination With Carbidopa Entacapone ( LCE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence remain serious public health problem ; however clearly effective pharmacological treatment identify date . We hypothesize identification subgroup cocaine-dependent patient help develop targeted effective treatment . We hypothesize individual difficulty achieve abstinence deficit dopaminergic function correct deficit use dopaminergic medication levodopa combination carbidopa entacapone ( LCE ) increase availability uptake levodopa synthesize dopamine brain result clinical improvement . We unable locate clinical report might provide data interaction cocaine LCE . Therefore , would like conduct inpatient safety study characterize cardiovascular behavioral effect cocaine administration presence LCE . The propose study involve inpatient stay 12 day participant two cocaine-administration session , include five dos smoke cocaine ascending dos . Participants maintain placebo capsule prior first study session LCE prior second session . Physiological ( HR , BP , ECG ) well behavioral ( subjective effect ) effect cocaine monitor cocaine-administration session . Serial blood sample also follow cocaine administration ass whether pharmacokinetics cocaine alter treatment LCE . All participant also undergo two cognitive test session , one placebo one LCE , employ computerized battery ( Quarters , Gambling task , Drug Stroop , Threat Responsivity task ) . There optional functional MRI ( fMRI ) component investigate behavioral neural indicator reward responsivity , think reflect dopaminergic transmission . Participants choose undergo fMRI test complete two session , day cognitive task session . Data obtain present study use inform large , control trial LCE treatment seek cocaine-dependent individual .</detailed_description>
