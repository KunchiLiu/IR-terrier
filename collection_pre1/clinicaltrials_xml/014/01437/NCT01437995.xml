	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline recommend step therapy asthma control least 3 month . For patient treat inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) alone , dose reduction 25-50 % minimal dose control disease recommend . The optimal approach reduce treatment patient asthma treat combination inhaled corticosteroid long-acting beta agonist ( ICS/LABA ) clear . The American Lung Association Asthma Clinical Research Center ( ALAACRC ) network 18 asthma research center goal perform clinical trial directly relevant clinical practice . The question optimal way de-escalate therapy patient asthma well control fix dose combination ICS/LABA key question practitioner care patient moderate severe persistent asthma . We propose 56 week multi-center , prospective , randomize , three-arm parallel group comparative effectiveness study compare three approach care patient asthma well-controlled three month combination ICS/LABA : reduction ICS dose maintenance LABA , initial discontinuation LABA continuation ICS , continuation stable dose ICS/LABA . Our primary goal perform pragmatic study resembles clinical practice determine optimal treatment strategy result low rate treatment failure 48 week follow-up . Additional exploratory analysis include assess risk factor step-down failure , assess duration time asthma control maintain therapy de-escalated .</detailed_description>
