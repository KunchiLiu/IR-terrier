	<brief_title>Treatment Acetabular Posterior Wall Fracture With Anatomical Locking Plate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetabular fracture common high-energy injury , anatomic acetabular deep location complex form cause diagnosis treatment difficult . For displaced acetabular fracture , preferred treatment open reduction internal fixation . The purpose surgery restore acetabular integrity stability , allow early exercise , decrease complication . Acetabular posterior wall fracture common , current clinical application fixation acetabular fracture common plate reconstruction steel plate . But acetabular posterior wall fracture , patient satisfy surgery . The reason mainly reconstruction plate need remould surgery , lead extension operation time , also cause poor attach . Otherwise , reconstruction plate need location angle screw surgery . If operator lack experience make harm surrounding vessels nerve . Some research achieve improvement anatomy acetabular fracture lock plate . But plate match anatomy acetabular posterior wall . This anatomical bone plate design base plate patent protection use clinical trial . It new type internal fixation acetabular posterior wall fracture , plate improve shortcoming exist technology , provide pre-formed anatomical fixation plate , direction lock screw hole . This design provide good attach acetabular posterior wall , safe use screw , make stable reliable fixation . This fixation plate suitable experienced doctor , also suitable less experienced doctor theory . They quickly accurately fix correct position , thus fixation plate advantage improve surgical success rate , short hospital stay , reduce disease painful use adult patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men woman age 18 year old ( upper age limit ) . Fracture acetabular posterior wall fracture confirm either anteroposterior lateral hip radiograph , compute tomography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Operative treatment fracture within 14 day present emergency room . Patient ambulatory prior fracture , though may use aid cane walker . Anticipated medical optimalization operation . Provision inform consent patient legal guardian . No major trauma . Refuse participate . Patients suitable internal fixation ( i.e. , severe osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , pathologic fracture ) . Associated major injury low extremity ( i.e. , ipsilateral contralateral fracture foot , ankle , tibia , fibula , knee , femur ; dislocation ankle , knee , hip ; femoral head defect fracture ) . Retained hardware around affected acetabular . Infection around acetabular ( i.e. , soft tissue bone ) . Patients disorder bone metabolism except osteoporosis ( i.e. , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , osteomalacia ) . Moderate severe cognitively impaired patient ( i.e. , Six Item Screener 3 error ) . Patients Parkinson 's disease ( dementia ) severe enough increase likelihood fall severe enough compromise rehabilitation . Likely problem , judgment investigator , maintain followup . We , example , exclude patient fixed address , report plan move town next year , intellectually challenge patient without adequate family support .</criteria>
