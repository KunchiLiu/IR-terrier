	<brief_summary>Vitamin D essential bone health . In Canada , obtain sunlight exposure skin ( April October ) food fatty fish , egg fortify milk margarine . This study 3 main goal determine Veteran 's enough vitamin D store body , add supplement 2000 IU/d enough correct low vitamin D store , specially formulate food use approve vitamin D supplement , appropriate maintain vitamin D store relation functional cognitive status . Initially , 2000 IU supplement vitamin D provide 8 week . After period , participant randomly separate 3 group ( Group A , B C ) period 24 week . Group A receive usual menu . Group B receive usual menu 1 portion food contain 500 IU add vitamin D. Group C receive usual menu 1 portion food contain 1000 IU add vitamin D. Food intake assessed every 8 week blood sample take every 4 week monitor change blood concentration vitamin D indicator bone health . The investigator document weight height , hand grip strength , mid-arm mid-calf circumference , capacity perform activity daily live , number prescription change health condition . The investigator also take X-ray tibia upper arm document amount quality bone region . A total 60 veteran Ste-Anne 's Hospital participate study . Knowing vitamin D status intake help confirming require vitamin D recommendation elderly men live long-term care institution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective propose 2 phase-protocol age Canadian veteran ( n=60 ) evaluate impact 2000 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation ( tablet liquid form ) correct low vitamin D status associate impact biochemistry , bone health marker marker inflammation Fall period ( Before After , 8 week ) , 2 ) evaluate food-based supplementation maintain vitamin D3 status thereafter winter spring measure serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration follow intake vitamin D deliver ( liquid form vitamin D3 ) use food vehicle provide additional 1000 IU/day 500 IU/day compare regular meal offer Ste-Anne 's Hospital ( SAH ) ( Randomized Controlled Trial , 3 group , 24 week ) . Anthropometry ( weight , height , BMI , mid-arm mid-calf circumference ) , grip strength , biochemical marker bone health ( 25 ( OH ) D , PTH , calcium , ionized calcium phosphate ) , assessment cognitive functional status ( Mini-Mental State Evaluation , Frail Elderly Functional Assessment , Physiotherapy Functional Mobility Profile Pain Assessment Checklist ) well volumetric bone mineral density use peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) gather . The long-term goal research program use novel food-delivery system approach enhance vitamin D intake meet need population . For year , medication deliver food study apply natural health product vitamin D. In chronic care , number prescription pill high often 13 account multiple administration day . Further documentation health related indicator capacity perform daily activity chronic pain intensity would relate quality life improve understand vitamin D bone health relate issue . The reality long-term care facility ( financial , human material resource ) need address newly develop delivery mode meet needs resident project increase care require age Canadian population . Large scale intervention need take place give insight efficacy efficiency new food delivery approach .</detailed_description>

These level care permit investigation include palliative condition . Individuals chronic disease permit participate long disease endstage ( ie prognosis 4 month ) . Not exclude comorbidities poor cognition consistent work others area . Lastly combined oral enteral feeding mode include since majority quickly transition food take mealreplacement/liquid supplement . Endstage renal disease due alter vitamin D metabolism use vitamin D analogues Endstage liver disease Untreated hyperparathyroid condition cancer metabolic bone disease except osteoporosis osteomalacia Any condition require enteral feed alone feed route exclude since oral intake , even partial , critical measurement .</criteria>
