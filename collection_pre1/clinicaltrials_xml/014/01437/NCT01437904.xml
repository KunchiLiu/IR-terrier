	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing The Feasibility Of Outpatient Tubeless Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ( PCNL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One eight human being develop kidney stone lifetime . Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) standard minimally invasive surgical operation removal large kidney stone . Around world , patient routinely admit hospital follow PCNL . The reason outpatient PCNL otherwise attempt related risk bleed need indwell kidney drainage tube . Other single publication mid-1980 's , publication regard outpatient PCNL year , group Queen 's University . We challenge need hospitalization follow PCNL provide proper technique percutaneous renal access use patient carefully select . In fact , safely perform outpatient tubeless PCNL 5 patient date two relate publish abstract present 2008 international Urology conference Albuquerque , New Mexico Shanghai , China . Our manuscript title `` Totally tubeless outpatient percutaneous nephrolithotomy : initial case report '' publish Advances Urology 2009 . Additionally , second manuscript title `` Outpatient tubeless PCNL : initial case series '' currently press Canadian Urological Association Journal . Outpatient PCNL offer patient several potential benefit , include decrease pain due lack nephrostomy tube , early faster convalescence lower rate hospital acquire infection complication . Furthermore , outpatient PCNL may offer several potential cost saving hospital health care system , include daily cost inpatient hospital bed , image procedural cost antegrade nephrostogram , include interventional radiologist 's fee , cost nursing staff cost intravenous antibiotic medication require hospitalized patient . Conversely , outpatient PCNL could potentially result additional cost emergency visit , readmission intervention occur . Project Synopsis This project pilot study examines safety , efficacy , feasibility potential cost saving perform percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) outpatient basis . If show feasible , outpatient PCNL could result significant potential cost saving hospital health care system , normal care follow PCNL involve 1-3 day hospital stay . The main objective pilot study obtain preliminary data necessary develop definitive national multicentre prospective randomize control trial compare outpatient PCNL standard PCNL . Hypotheses Patients successfully randomized outpatient versus standard PCNL outpatient PCNL successful procedure .</detailed_description>
