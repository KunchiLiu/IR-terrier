	<brief_summary>The propose study design phase Ib open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy StrataGraft skin tissue promote heal deep partial-thickness component complex skin defect . The propose study population include patient 3-49 % Total Body Surface Area ( TBSA ) complex skin defect include deep partial-thickness component result thermal injury . The study design focus evaluation safety tolerability prolong exposure increase amount single application StrataGraft skin tissue , also assess potential StrataGraft tissue promote heal deep partial-thickness component complex skin defect alternative donor site harvest autografting . Targeted enrollment study 30 patient complex skin defect due thermal burn require surgical excision autografting . Subjects sequentially enrol two cohort increase treatment area receive StrataGraft skin tissue store refrigerate prior clinical use . A third cohort receive StrataGraft skin tissue store cryopreserved thawed operating room prior grafting .</brief_summary>
