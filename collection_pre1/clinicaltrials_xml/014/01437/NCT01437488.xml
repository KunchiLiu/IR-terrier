	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label study , mean patient treated fashion investigational agent . Scans perform every 3 cycle treatment , patient withdraw study event progression drug intolerance define within protocol . Treatment administer outpatient basis . No investigational commercial agent therapy describe may administer intent treat patient 's malignancy . The length cycle 21 day . For first cycle treatment , cabazitaxel dose 20 mg/m2 . During cycle 1 , complete blood count perform day 8 15 , dose Day 1 cycle 2 depend upon nadir count day . If , toxicity assessment day 1 cycle 2 , patient residual &gt; grade 2 toxicity , laboratory parameter within acceptable limit ( see ) , investigator 's discretion dose escalate 25 mg/m2 . 25 mg/m2 FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) -approved dose prostate cancer . Neulasta give dose cabazitaxel decrease risk febrile neutropenic complication .</detailed_description>
