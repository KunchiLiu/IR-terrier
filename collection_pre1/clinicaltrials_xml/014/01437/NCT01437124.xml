	<brief_summary>The investigator aim measure blood level certain metal group patient ceramic metal total hip replacement . This new bearing surface ( joint ) relatively new investigator currently follow large cohort world . Clinical result currently excellent 2 year patient , however investigator mindful lesson learn high failure rate several design metal metal hip replacement well several vitro report one vivo case report elevate metal level particular implant . The investigator feel important measure metal ion level group ascertain compare reference standard . Once perform investigator relate ion level function x ray change provide useful longterm data patient wider medical community whether bear surface safe long term whether 's use abandon . This useful numerous group implant device UK addition award FDA approval USA - use likely flourish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE &amp; DESIGN : The investigator currently follow cohort patient metal ceramic total hip arthroplasty . This new bearing couple approve use UK time recently achieve USA FDA approval . The attraction bear couple low rate wear reduce complication associate ceramic ceramic bearing bearing fracture . Of recent medium attention unacceptably high failure DePuy ASR metal metal hip resurfacing . This metal metal bear couple associate increased ion level chromosome abnormality vivo . In vitro study small vivo study reveal much low wear , particle number ion level ceramic metal study metal metal bearing surface ; however large scale evidence case . The investigator currently follow large worldwide series ceramic metal bearing clinical result excellent . It important however obtain hard data metal ion level population firstly ensure long term function health cohort also provide barometer surgeon use prosthesis yet little way long term follow data ion level large cohort . If ion level unacceptably high investigator need follow patient closely offer revision surgery clinical concern . For similar reason important monitor chromosomal abnormality .</detailed_description>
