	<brief_summary>Oncolytic virus virus find nature , modify longer multiply normal cell . These virus `` infect '' cancer cell kill . Once cancer cell die thousand virus release potentially infect cancer cell area . The effect oncolytic virus tumor felt result combination oncolytic virus directly kill tumor cell well patient 's immune system kill cancer cell infect oncolytic virus . Modern oncolytic virus use treatment thousand patient . The safety treatment good death cause treatment oncolytic virus . Many patient benefit treatment sense tumor stop grow , become small even completely disappear . Some benefit temporary , one third patient seem gain longer last benefit likely impact survival . The effect oncolytic virus improve survival demonstrate yet . Oncolytic virus create many different type virus . In study investigator use oncolytic virus create adenovirus . Adenoviruses types virus cause common cold flu . Because replication normal cell take place , oncolytic virus cause diseases normal cell . Further , date incidence pass virus human patient treat oncolytic virus . The purpose study see high dose CGTG-102 ( oncolytic virus use study ) safely give subject . The investigator also evaluate whether CGTG-102 helpful reduce size cancer improve patient survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GOAT ; Phase I Open Label Study CGTG-102 , GM-CSF Encoding Oncolytic Adenovirus , Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-treatment visit - subject undergo physical examination vital sign , blood sample take PET ( Positron emission tomography ) -CT ( Computer tomography ) scan perform . Thereafter , 4 visit injection perform trial day 1 , 4 , 8 15 . TREATMENT : The injection give directly tumor help use ultrasound . The total dose oncolytic virus subject receive divide 1-10 injection inject individual tumor body . The maximum number tumor inject one treatment 10 tumor . STUDY VISIT 1 : On day 1 visit , blood sample take well two biopsy one tumor . In addition pleural fluid ( fluid chest ) ascites ( fluids abdominal wall ) may collect possible . Then subject receive first set injection CGTG-102 . Before injection , subject may give dose Tylenol . STUDY VISIT 2 : On day 4 visit , addition blood sample take subject receive second round intratumoral injection tumor select injection day 1 . Urine also collect right subject go home . STUDY VISIT 3 : The day 8 visit identical day 4 visit . The blood sample urine sample take . STUDY VISIT 4 : On day 15 visit blood sample urine sample take well biopsy one tumor . Subjects stay overnight hospital treatment . FOLLOW UP : A follow-up visit schedule day 29 blood sample urine sample take . The end trial visit schedule around day 43 addition lab sample PET-CT scan perform . Following day 43 subject contact study staff 6 week interval 3 month , 3 month interval one year yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
