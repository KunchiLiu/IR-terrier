	<brief_summary>The primary objective protocol study long-term outcome large group traumatic brain injury patient . This outcome describe term activity , participation , quality life , SOCIO-professional outcome impact caregiver , relation health care provision . The secondary outcome measure impact functional outcome several predictive factor , relative importance outcome . Our principal hypothesis SOCIO-professional health provision factor play major role long-term outcome , even initial severity brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PariS-TBI Study : Paris Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This work represent part large collaborative prospective study call PariS-TBI ( Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Parisian area ) finance French National Authority Health . The PariS-TBI study undertaken 2005 , provide epidemiological data . Patients age 15 include sustain severe TBI Parisian area , define initial Coma Glasgow Score ( GCS ) 8 less . During 20-months period , consecutive patient meet inclusion criterion recruit mobile emergency service . Data patient ' demographic , injury characteristic , acute post acute phase collect prospectively . Patients evaluate phone interview one year post traumatism . A total 504 patient include , 257 alive end acute care . Investigations present work undertaken four six year brain injury survivor . Patients initial cohort contact twice phone call post . Information follow study give orally write form . Informed consent patient legal advisor obtain set appointment evaluation . Evaluation take place either patient 's place living , clinical setting hospital Broussais , Paris , France Raymond POINCARE , GARCHES , France , accord patient 's choice . Two trained neuropsychologists lead evaluation , interview patient informal care giver , define person ( family member friend ) , responsible day-to-day decision make care patient . If patient refuse interview , short questionnaire propose neuropsychologist phone . Demographic pre-traumatism clinical data available initial study , well data type severity traumatism , evolution acute care . Early outcome data include cognitive disability ( Dysexecutive Questionnaire ) , global participation ( Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended ) , return work . Data assess present study include evaluation deficiency : presence importance motor sequela , cerebellar dysfunction , visual auditive deficiency , epilepsy , chronic pain . Cognitive deficiency assess Neurobehavioural Rating Scale-Revised , Dysexecutive Questionnaire , questionnaire complaint patient informal care giver . Activities evaluate Barthel index . Capacity motor vehicle drive assess . Participations measure globally Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended , specifically SOCIO-professional integration questionnaire BICRO-39 scale . Quality life assess EuroQoL questionnaire , global evaluation patient 's quality life 0-10 numeric scale patient care giver . The Hospital Anxiety Depression Score measure . Data patient ' pathway intensity clinical care collect : clinical pathway acute care home health care facility discharge , quantification clinical follow rehabilitation . The patient 's environment ( place living , presence informal carers ) assess , well modality return work . The questionnaire include data financial compensation intensity formal home care . Data quality life informal care giver evaluation burden care collect , use ZARIT questionnaire . The exploitation large data base enable up-to-date description long term outcome severe TBI patient Parisian area . It use clarify role several factor long term activity , participation quality life severe TBI patient , hypothesis factor directly relate severity traumatism play small role long term outcome SOCIO-environmental characteristic professional category , intensity rehabilitation care , presence informal care . Statistical analysis conduct RÂ® statistical software . Association various predictive factor outcome ( GOSE , BICRO-39 , EuroQoL ) assess UNIVARIOUS test , follow multivarious regression model , use backward selection strategy select relevant variable .</detailed_description>
