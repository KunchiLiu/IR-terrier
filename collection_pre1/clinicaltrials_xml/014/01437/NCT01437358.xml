	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidural analgesia ( EA ) mainly investigated perioperative period . In intensive care unit setting , EA propose critically ill patient , postoperative trauma patient , typically . Recent finding also support anti-inflammatory , vascular respiratory effect EA , beyond analgesic effect . However , data EA safety feasibility intensive care unit setting still lack . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This observational multicenter prospective clinical study report incidence EA-related complication , infectious neurologic complication , mean duration EA ICU setting . Patients admit three intensive care unit ( two University Hospital one local hospital ) receive EA include study , whether EA catheter insert ICU outside ICU , e.g . operating room . Demographics , clinical biological data record prospectively . The main goal evaluate safety feasibility EA critically ill patient , assume technique currently routinely use intensive care unit , accordance national international guideline epidural analgesia practice .</detailed_description>
