	<brief_summary>This multicenter , international , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , Phase II trial . Participants advance breast cancer ( ABC ) Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC ) experience recurrence progression disease receive aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy relapse within 6 month complete adjuvant AI therapy enrol Part I study . Participants ABC MBC receive prior AI therapy PIK3CA-mutant tumor enrol Part II study . Part I study assess effect addition GDC-0941 fulvestrant ( Arm A ) GDC-0980 fulvestrant ( Arm B ) progression free survival ( PFS ) compare fulvestrant + placebo ( Arm C ) . Part II study examine safety tolerability estimate effect GDC-0941 combination fulvestrant ( Arm D ) PFS versus fulvestrant + placebo ( Arm E ) participant receive prior treatment AI whose tumor contain PIK3CA mutation .</brief_summary>
