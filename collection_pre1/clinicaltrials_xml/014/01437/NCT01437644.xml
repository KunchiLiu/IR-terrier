	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy common . It affect approximately 3 per 1000 child . Hip displacement due muscle tightness ( spasticity ) occur half severely affected child , many child require major ( bony ) hip surgery . After bony hip surgery management pain difficult , spasticity tend increase cause painful spasm difficult control . Botulinum Toxin injection know reduce spasticity therefore also reduce pain . These injection take least week work , effect last month . Botulinum Toxin already establish treatment chronic hip pain prior surgery . The investigator aim find whether Botulinum Toxin injection reduce post-operative pain . The identification level pain challenge child unable communicate verbally . The investigator therefore use validate pain score tool design especially child . This study first describe fully pain experience child cerebral palsy undergo type major surgery . The investigator compare Botulinum Toxin injection placebo ( non-active ) injection . There high emotional financial burden family child . Families describe high level emotional distress around time surgery , particularly child pain . Difficulty pain control post operatively may delay discharge hospital parental return work . It cause disrupted sleep child family may delay child 's return school . The result study share professional family international conference scientific popular ( patient-based ) publication . This study undertaken adult cerebral palsy rarely undergo sort surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Botulinum toxin inject intramuscularly beneficial management spasticity treatment chronic hip pain child cerebral palsy . Botulinum injection also seem useful reduce spasticity acute post operative period ; benefit botulinum toxin describe one study post-operative pain follow minor hip surgery . After major ( bony ) hip surgery child experience significantly pain , also seem exacerbated spasticity . Botulinum toxin may therefore reduce pain follow major hip surgery . Research require assess value set . This studied adult rarely undergo surgery . Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common cause physical disability childhood , affect 3 child per 1000 throughout Europe ( 1 ; 2 ) . The Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) design child describe level motor skill ( 3 ) . Over 25 % child CP probably fall severely affected group - GMFCS level IV V. These child independently ambulant likely cognitive communication difficulty . They high risk develop hip displacement ( ie hip gradually come socket ) ( 4-10 ) . Previous study suggest half hip painful well-established hip displacement painful child ( 14-18 ) . Prevention painful hip displacement advocate screen programme timely surgical intervention ( 11-13 ) . Some child need bony reconstructive surgery . Long term follow study demonstrate maintains position femoral head acetabulum time , reduce likelihood painful hip due dislocation ( 9 ; 10 ) . The management pain severely neurologically impaired child undergo hip ( ) surgery challenge various strategy employ , include use post-operative epidural . In child spasticity abnormally high post-operative muscle tone may cause painful muscle spasm . These involuntary sustain muscle contraction think contribute significantly pain child cerebral palsy hip problem . There number treatment available muscle spasm cerebral palsy ; systemic except botulinum toxin target individual muscle mean intramuscular injection . Botulinum toxin type A ( BTXA ) injection well establish , clinically effective safe treatment muscle spasticity CP ( 2 ; 19 ; 20 ) . Research suggest may beneficial effect reduce pain due spasticity ( 18 ) . Graham co-worker establish BTXA safe perioperative period child cerebral palsy undergo soft tissue surgery hip problem . Lundy Fairhurst demonstrate BTXA safe effective child severe cerebral palsy , GMFCS IV &amp; V dose give line European Consensus guideline . ( 24 ) Work pain child CP suggest anxiety unrelieved pain may stimulate autonomic nervous system way child may actually amplify pain response undergo surgical procedure . Actions stretch muscle cast rehabilitation exercise may exacerbate spasm therefore increase pain ( 8 ; 17 ; 21 ) . Describing pain child cognitive impairment however challenge . Studies focus report pain symptom , duration , intensity analgesia requirement . Hunt et al provide validated pain profile questionnaire objectively measure pain severely neurologically affect group child communication difficulty ( 22 ) . The investigator gain experience use Paediatric Pain Profile describe level pain group child . It validate user friendly system , already place institution .</detailed_description>
