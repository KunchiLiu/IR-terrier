	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research study find good way treat melanoma . The goal study : 1 . To measure side effect find well patient tolerate recMAGE-A3 + AS15 ASCI ( MAGE-A3 ASCI ) treatment without Poly IC : LC 2 . To see well patient 's immune system respond MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment without Poly IC : LC 3 . To measure rate return patient 's tumor MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment without Poly IC : LC 4 . To measure rate return patient 's tumor two group patient : one group positive gene signature , group positive gene signature tumor MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment without Poly IC : LC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Assess Safety Immunogenicity recMAGE-A3+AS15 ASCI With Without Poly IC : LC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first year , participant may receive 8 injection give follow order : 1 . 5 ASCI injection without Poly IC : LC 3-week interval . 2 . 3 ASCI injection without Poly IC : LC 3-month interval . During year 2 3 , participant may receive 5 ASCI injection without Poly IC : LC give follow order : 3 . During year 2 , ASCI injection without Poly IC : LC give every 3 month total 3 injection . 4 . During year 3 , ASCI injection without Poly IC : LC continue give every 3 month total 2 injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent study obtain prior performance MAGEA3 expression screen resect tumor tissue protocolspecific procedure . Male female patient histologically proven completely resect stage IV cutaneous mucosal melanoma . In term American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) classification [ AJCC , 2009 ] , mean patient resect M1abc ( stage IV ) disease may enrol . The patient must surgically render free disease 12 week randomization . Patient equal great 18 year old time signing informed consent form . The patient 's tumor show expression MAGEA3 gene , determine Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RTPCR ) analysis paraffin imbed tumor tissue ( FFPE ) . In patient obtain , frozen portion resect tumor analyze gene profiling . The patient fully recover surgery . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 time randomization . The patient must adequate bonemarrow reserve , adequate renal function adequate hepatic function assess standard laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) equal great 1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelet count equal great 75 x 10^9/L , Serum creatinine equal less 1.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , Total bilirubin equal le 1.5 time ULN , Transaminase ( ALT AST ) equal less 2.5 time ULN If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e . current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy post menopausal , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception 30 day prior randomization , negative pregnancy test continue precaution entire study treatment period 2 month completion injection series . Men must also agree use adequate method contraception . In opinion investigator , patient comply requirement protocol . The patient ocular melanoma . The patient intransit metastasis . The patient treat schedule treated adjuvant anticancer therapy metastasectomy qualifies patient inclusion present trial . One prior systemic treatment immunomodulator ( i.e. , interferon , vaccine and/or antiCTLA4 ) previous surgery permit , provide last dose administer least 45 day randomization present trial . Previous radiotherapy permit , provide treatment complete surgery qualifies patient participation present trial . The patient require concomitant chronic treatment ( 7 consecutive day ) systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . The use prednisone , equivalent , dose &lt; 0.125 mg/kg/day ( absolute maximum 10 mg/day ) topical steroid permit . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study treatment within 30 day precede randomization plan use study period . The patient history autoimmune disease , limited , multiple sclerosis , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients vitiligo exclude . The patient family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . The patient know positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) another confirm suspect immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component treatment . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent comply trial procedure . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . The patient previous concomitant malignancy site , except effectively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix effectively treat malignancy remission 5 year highly likely cure . The patient uncontrolled bleed disorder . For female patient : patient pregnant lactating .</criteria>
