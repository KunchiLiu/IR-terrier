	<detailed_description>This single-dose , open-label , randomize , two-period , two-way crossover , food-effect study 12 healthy adult subject receive two separate single-dose administration lofexidine 400 μg ( 2 x 200 μg tablet ) . In one study period , subject administer study treatment follow overnight fast least 10 hour . In study period subject fast overnight least 10 hour , begin consume FDA standard high-calorie , high-fat breakfast meal 30 minute prior administration study drug . Subjects assign number ascend order , base successful completion screen process . Subjects receive treatment list randomized fashion two treatment period : Treatment A : Test Formulation Lofexidine 400 μg Dose = 2 x 200 μg tablet administer fasted condition US WorldMeds , LLC Treatment B : Test Formulation Lofexidine 400 μg Dose = 2 x 200 μg tablet administer fed condition US WorldMeds , LLC Each drug administration separate washout period least seven day . Each dose orally administer along 240 mL ( 8 fl . oz . ) room temperature tap water . After dose , food allow 4 hour post-dose . Except 240 mL room temperature tap water provide dose , water may consume 1 hour prior 1 hour post dose . Meals schedule approximately times relative dose study period . In order prevent adverse event ( AEs ) hypotension , subject intravenous ( IV ) access establish check-in administer normal saline ( NS ) continuous rate 150 cc/hour 1 hour prior dose administration . The IV catheter remain place least 12 hour postdose additional fluid administer need . If symptom clinically significant hypotension persist , IV fluid administration may continue 12 hour , longer need determine Investigator . Subjects withdraw study may replace . During study period , 6 mL blood sample obtain prior dose follow dose select time 48 hour post-dose . A total 28 pharmacokinetic blood sample collect subject , 14 sample study period . Plasma pharmacokinetic sample analyze lofexidine use validated analytical method . Appropriate pharmacokinetic parameter calculate formulation use non-compartmental method . In addition , blood drawn urine collect clinical laboratory test screen end study .</detailed_description>
