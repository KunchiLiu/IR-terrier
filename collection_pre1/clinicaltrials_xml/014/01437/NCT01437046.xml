	<brief_summary>Only three medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment alcohol dependence ( AD ) , namely disulfiram , naltrexone tablet injection , acamprosate , however treatment success inconsistent . Thus , exist substantial need discover way provide effective treatment . Pre-clinical clinical evidence clearly demonstrate noradrenergic ( NE ) system involve neurobiology AD , thus represent interest new pharmacotherapy target theoretical rationale proposal . Consistent concept NE system may represent new pharmacological target AD , recent study show prototype alpha-1 NE receptor antagonist prazosin reduces alcohol drink different animal model . Furthermore , clinical evidence also confirm prazosin appear efficacious reduce alcohol consumption alcohol-dependent individual . While prazosin significant side effect profile must take three time day , α1-blockers investigate alcohol research . Prazosin short-acting α1-blocker approve treat hypertension ( HTN ) benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . After approval prazosin 70 's , selective α1-blockers develop treat HTN and/or BPH . Among , doxazosin show manageable safer profile prazosin . In fact , doxazosin long-acting α1-blocker , thus take once/day . Doxazosin also less likely give hypotensive side-effects . Thus , doxazosin commonly use clinical practice treat HTN and/or BPH , short-acting α1-blockers , prazosin . Poor adherence medication and/or side-effects represent important factor limit effectiveness pharmacotherapies patient AD . If effective AD , doxazosin may represent simple , manageable safe medication , might easily transferable clinical practice . However , doxazosin never test AD . This project 10-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled , between-subject randomized clinical trial doxazosin ( 16mg once/day ) alcohol dependent ( AD ) individual . This study attempt address whether doxazosin effective safe pharmacotherapy AD .</brief_summary>
