	<brief_summary>More 1.5 million individual infect HCV Italy . They risk develop related morbidity mortality cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma , unless evolution disease halt treatment-induced HCV RNA clearance . Indeed , well recognize curative antiviral treatment , lead HCV RNA undetectability 24 week end therapy , may prevent occurrence complication HCV chronic liver disease . Several pre-treatment host viral factor associate outcome pegylated Interferon Ribavirin treatment . These predictor relevant ability identify patient high likelihood achieve HCV RNA clearance may increase number patient agree treat maintain adherence treatment . Several pre-treatment predictor HCV genotype , HCV viral load , age , gender , body mass index , stage fibrosis race well recognize use many year treatment decision-making process . Based study viral kinetics , HCV RNA undetectable week 4 treatment show represent best treatment predictor response . In addition well know factor , recently , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) upstream gene IL28B chromosome 19 , cod IFN-lambda 3 identify associate spontaneous treatment induce HCV RNA clearance . We develop molecular technique need evaluate polymorphism laboratory . This technical process consequence genetics expertise research Institute . We also perform valuable comparison different method evaluate polymorphism . Comparison different technology allow u know rate variability different assay use . With methodology evaluate `` posteriori '' patient previously enrol Randomized Controlled Trial . The result study confirm association IL28B CC allele favorable outcome HCV infection geographic area ( Mangia et al Gastroenterology 2010 ; Mangia et al Hepatology 2010 , AASLD presentation ) . We interested prospective evaluation patient refer center aim understand whether difference rate IL28B frequencies patient different HCV genotype . In fact , hypothesize frequency IL28B might different accord different HCV genotype difference may explain different rate response antiviral treatment report patient HCV infection . Since lead collaborative group hepatologists name AL-LIVER operate Puglia , Lazio , Basilicata , Sicilia Campania region Italy would like extend evaluation collaborative group explore large number patient whether prevalence CC , CT TT genotypes inversely associate HCV G1 , 4 , 3 2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Study IL28B Genetic Variants Italian Patients With HCV Infection naïve Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prevalence study involve naïve patient without link treatment . Five hundred patient HCV infection consecutively observed 2011 request sign inform consent aim test genetics . The study evaluate approved Central Ethic Committee . It plan duration 12 month involve 15 center . All HCV infect patient previously untreated enrolled sign Informed consent genetic testing . Each patient enrol single center evaluate demographical , virological , biochemical , histological genetic ( IL28B ) characteristic . In case unavailable liver biopsy least APRI score Fibroscan evaluation use assess severity underlie liver disease . All blood specimen store evaluated pre-developed TaqMan allelic discrimination assay ( Applied Biosystem ) direct sequence IL28B genetic variation . A serum sample also store evaluate HCV genotype HCV RNA level . Data collect database use future select patient need antiviral treatment . The association IL28B variant predictor explore mean descriptive statistical analysis . Number patient , mean , standard deviation , median calculate continuous variable . Absolute frequency per cent use describe frequency parameter</detailed_description>
