	<brief_summary>Background : - Some type cancer , like cancer esophagus , difficult detect early stage . A possible detection method involve collect breath sample look chemical may sign cancer . However , research need determine different chemical appear different breath sample . This study involve healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To study chemical appear breath sample healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 30 60 year age . Design : - Participants fast overnight ( midnight morning ) provide two breath sample take 5 minute apart . - Breath sample collect day 1 , 49 , 98 study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Although breath test common specific use biomarker highly concentrated ( e .g . alcohol , urea Helicobacter prylori infection ) , low concentration compound breath also provide information exogenous exposure endogenous metabolic process . Employing standardized collection technique high sensitivity measurement technology show breath profile accurately identify people disease breast cancer lung cancer . Breath profile technology great potential non-invasive tool diagnosis risk stratification precancerous disease well elucidation cause cancer . Prior use breath profile purpose essential assess much breath profile part breath profile relatively stable period time . Objectives : The primary objective pilot study ass intra-individual variability breath profile sample period 98 day . Eligibility : DCEG volunteer age 30-60 year , inclusive . Design : Pilot study . Five DCEG volunteer enrol study . We assess breath profile sample duplicate three time period ( day 1 , 49 98 ) . We calculate coefficient variation ( CV ) determine proportion part breath profile value less 10 % collect day,49 day apart , 98 day apart .</detailed_description>
