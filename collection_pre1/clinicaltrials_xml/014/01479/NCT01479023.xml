	<brief_summary>2.1 Primary Objectives 1 . To measure human dosimetry 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 subject advance solid tumor ( Cohort 1 ) 2 . To calculate HER3 receptor occupancy ( via quantification tumor-localized PET signal produce 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 absence presence compete unlabeled U3-1287 subject advance solid tumor ( Cohorts 2 5 ) ) 3 . To determine safety tolerability 64Cu-DOTA-U3-1287 ( cohort ) 2.2 Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine relationship U3-1287 serum concentration HER3 receptor occupancy ( measure PET/CT ) subject advanced solid tumor 2 . To measure tumor response rate define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) subject advance solid tumor treat U3-1287 ( Part 2 ) 3 . To characterize PK exposure U3 1287 administer intravenously patient advance solid malignancy . 4 . To measure rate anti-U3-1287 human antibody development subject advance solid tumor treat U3 1287 monotherapy 2.3 Exploratory Objectives 1 . To assess tumor volume change U3-1287 treatment CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( Part 2 ) 2 . To assess blood , body fluid/tissue , tumor specimen potential biomarkers ( e.g. , proteins transcript ) predict response U3-1287 3 . To obtain tumor sample DNA extraction analysis potential predictor response U3-1287 related gene suggest emerge data</brief_summary>
