	<brief_summary>The Prophylactic Antibiotic Regimens Tumor Surgery ( PARITY ) trial first ever international multi-center randomize control trial bone cancer surgery . In order avoid amputation bone cancer leg , complex limb-saving operation perform . However , infection devastate complication follow surgery common . Surgeons across world randomize patient receive either short- long-duration antibiotic regimen surgery goal identify best regimen reduce infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-bone sarcoma historically manage amputation . In current era osteosarcoma management , amputation generally avoid complex surgery malignancy remove limb reconstruct advanced surgical technique . This process limb salvage possible improvement chemotherapeutic regimen , advance image technique surgical innovation modular metallic implant . However , risk surgical complication high due complexity surgery . The common devastating complication surgical site infection . Background work data pilot study indicate infection rate approach 15 % . Multiple surgical attempt eradication infection fail 50 % case , result amputation . Published guideline post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis follow many standard less complex elective surgical procedure dictate prophylactic antibiotic discontinue 24 hour . However , effective duration treatment sarcoma surgery previously examine . Given limitation evidence , possible orthopaedic oncologist draw firm conclusion , therefore , clinical practice highly varied , particularly respect antibiotic duration . Our international , multi-center randomize controlled trial determine whether 5-day regimen post-operative prophylactic antibiotic comparison standard 24-hour regimen decrease rate surgical site infection limb salvage surgery within 1-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
