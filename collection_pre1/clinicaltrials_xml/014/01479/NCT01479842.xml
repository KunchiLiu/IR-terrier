	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 give together rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride treat patient recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 together rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify specific toxicity recommend phase 2 dose PCI-32765 ( BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 ) orally ( PO ) combination rituximab bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) ( i.e. , `` combination therapy '' ) patient relapsed refractory B-cell NHL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate activity combine rituximab , bendamustine , PCI-32765 patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL measure response rate duration response . II . Identify potential marker ( ) predictive response combination therapy . III . Correlate pharmacogenetic ( PGx ) find patient response toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 . Patients receive BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Patients also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue receive BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 PO absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 4 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
