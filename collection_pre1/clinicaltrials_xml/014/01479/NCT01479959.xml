	<detailed_description>Context : Allowing functional communication major issue order preserve quality life tracheostomized ventilator-dependent patient . We show previous study use positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) neuromuscular tracheostomized ventilator-dependent patient improve speech allows patient expire ( least partly ) upper airway therefore speak expiration . The use PEEP compare use phonation valve place ventilator circuit allow complete expiration upper airways therefore speech . Both technique seem similar term efficiency speech ; PEEP , however , well tolerate seem secure ( system remain open expiration decrease risk high pressure , require handle ventilator circuit ) . Optimal PEEP level allow patient expire total expiratory volume upper airway PEEPeff may vary one patient . We seek determine individual PEEPeff compare 50 % value ( PEEPef50 ) . Indeed , PEEPeff may constitute best level expiratory speech mimic mechanisms phonation valve without fallback , prevent expiration expiratory circuit ventilator , also may lengthen expiration , delay inspiration allow speech , facilitate hyperinflation lead respiratory discomfort previously observe patient use phonation valve . Optimal PEEP level would best compromise best possible phonation best possible respiratory comfort therefore could lower PEEPeff . In order improve respiratory comfort high PEEP level , develop prototype ventilator PEEP activate switch control patient may activate need ( speech period ) . Objective : The main objective study optimize PEEP use determine individually appropriate level evaluation use overtime allow best possible speech best respiratory comfort secure condition tracheostomized ventilated patient . Different PEEP level evaluate PEEP activation control patient . Methods : Open randomize monocentric cross-over study ( patient control ) . Optimal PEEP level ( PEEPeff ) , define PEEP-level allow complete expiration upper airway , determine patient . Speech respiratory parameter study without PEEP , PEEPeff intermediate PEEP-level ( PEEP50 ) . Flow airway pressure measure upper airways resistance calculate . Microphone speech recording subject quantitative measurement qualitative assessment speech . For PEEP level follow protocol conduct : 5 minute quiet breathe PEEP , 10 minute spontaneous conversation , speech trial ( maximal sustain sound , glissando , text reading ) . Subjective evaluation speech respiratory comfort ( patient ) objective evaluation speech improvement accord PEEP level ( read duration , phonation duration , voice quality , assessment speech include intelligibility score , perceptual score evaluation prosody analyze two experimented speech therapist blind PEEP level ) . Evaluation PEEP control button use patient . Inclusion criterion : Neuromuscular adult patient , tracheotomized long-term ventilation cuffless tube , assist-control volumetric ventilation , stable state time study . Number patient , center : Considering pilot study , 14 subject include study . The subject recruit home ventilation unit intensive care department R. Poincare teach hospital ( Garches , France ) usual follow-up chronic respiratory failure . Duration study : 12 month . Duration participation patient 1h30 .</detailed_description>
