	<brief_summary>Colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) currently consider absolute contraindication liver transplantation ( Lt ) although Lt primary secondary liver malignancy show excellent outcome select patient . Before 1995 , several Lts CLM perform , outcome poor ( 18 % 5-year survival ) Lt CLM stop . Since , several advance achieve survival follow Lt improve almost 30 % . Thus , 5-year survival 50 % follow Lt CLM could anticipate . The investigator previously include 21 patient pilot study . All patient advance CLM time Lt. Long term overall survival ( OS ) exceed far previously report outcome patient group comparable good survival follow repeat Lt non-malignant diagnosis . Development robust selection criterion may improve result . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial explore whether liver transplantation select patient liver metastasis CRC obtain significant life extension well health relate quality life compare patient receive surgical resection . The investigator also explore patient selection accord nomo-grams outcome colorectal cancer define subgroup patient 5 year survival least 50 % even cure disease .</brief_summary>
