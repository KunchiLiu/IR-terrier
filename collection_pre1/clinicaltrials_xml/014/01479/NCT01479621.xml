	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent/assent sign date subject and/or parent /legal guardian conduct study related procedure . 2 . Male female 12 year old , Screening Visit . Male female 18 year old , Screening Visit , country local regulation regulatory status study medication permit enrollment adult . 3 . General good health , free concomitant condition treatment could interfere study conduct , influence interpretation study observations/results , put subject increase risk study . 4 . Asthma Diagnosis : Asthma define National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . 5 . Severity Disease : A best forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) 40 % 85 % predict normal value Screening Visit . NHANES III predict value use subject age ≥12 year adjustments predict value make African American subject . 6 . Reversibility Disease : Demonstrated ≥15 % reversibility FEV1 within 30 minute follow 2 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol ( require , spacers permit reversibility test ) Screening Visit . If subject fails demonstrate increase FEV1 ≥15 % , subject eligible study allow rescreen . 7 . Current Asthma Therapy : Subjects must shortacting β2agonist alone noncorticosteroid maintenance medication ( without shortacting β2agonist ) ≥ 3 month precede Screening Visit . Subjects must use inhale corticosteroid least 6 week precede Screening Visit . Exception : Based upon investigator 's judgment inherent harm change subject 's current ICS therapy subject provide consent , subject low dose ICS ( 100mcg Fp BID equivalent ) may switch shortacting β2 agonist alone Prescreening Visit . The subject require return clinic complete Screening Visit 2week washout period complete . 8 . ShortActing β2Agonists : All subject must able replace current shortacting β2agonists albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol Screening Visit use need duration study . The use spacer device meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) allow study exception use reversibility test Screening Visit . Nebulized albuterol/salbutamol allow time study . Subjects must able withhold inhale shortacting beta sympathomimetic bronchodilator least 6 hour prior study visit . 9 .

History lifethreatening asthma define protocol asthma episode require intubation and/or associate hypercapnea , respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure . 2 . Culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus , middle ear resolve within 2 week prior Screening Visit . In addition , subject must exclude infection occur Screening Visit Randomization Visit . 3 . Any asthma exacerbation require oral corticosteroid within 3 month Screening Visit . A subject must hospitalization asthma within 6 month prior Screening Visit . Note : An exacerbation asthma define worsen asthma require treatment rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI and/or subject 's regular noncorticosteroid maintenance treatment . This include require use systemic corticosteroid and/or emergency room visit hospitalization , change subject 's regular noncorticosteroid maintenance treatment , addition asthma medication . 4 . Presence glaucoma , cataract , ocular herpes simplex , malignancy basal cell carcinoma . 5 . Historical current evidence clinically significant disease include , limited : cardiovascular ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , know aortic aneurysm , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia coronary heart disease ) , hepatic , renal , hematological , neuropsychological , endocrine ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , Addison 's disease , Cushing 's syndrome ) , gastrointestinal ( e.g. , poorlycontrolled peptic ulcer , GERD ) , pulmonary ( e.g. , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis need treatment , cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , could affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . 6 . Have follow condition , judgment investigator , might cause participation study detrimental subject , include , limited : Current malignancy exclude basal cell carcinoma ; History malignancy acceptable subject remission one year prior Screening Visit . ( Remission define current evidence malignancy treatment malignancy 12 month prior Screening Visit ) Current untreated tuberculosis ; History tuberculosis acceptable subject receive approved prophylactic treatment regimen approve active treatment regimen evidence active disease minimum 2 year • Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP ≥160 diastolic BP &gt; 100 ) Stroke within 3 month prior Screening Visit Immunologic compromise 7 . History positive test HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . 8 . Clinical visual evidence oral candidiasis Screening Visit . 9 .
