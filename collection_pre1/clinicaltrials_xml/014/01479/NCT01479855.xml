	<detailed_description>Dementia Alzheimer type ( AD ) serious illness affect 60-70 000 people Norway estimate cost 12 Billion NOK ( Norwegian krone ) per year . The Department Social Affairs Health initiate psycho-social intervention program patient well caregiver , however , research regard etiology , pathology prevention disease . In early pilot study conduct AD patient moderate stage , significant decrease concentration vitamin thiamine , pyridoxal-5 phosphate , ascorbic acid retinol , cobalamin , increase homocystein , compare control group healthy elderly people . Logistic regression analysis show 5 model use different combination vitamin spinal protein , completely separate patient dementia healthy control . The current study replication mention study , include 120 AD patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) mild dementia ( MMSE 24/30 ) 60 healthy elderly control . Measurement vitamines nutrient blood spinal fluid central element study . The specimen therefore obtain patient control abstain supplement last four week . Outcome measure include biochemical analysis nutrient , expression peroxidation , expression DNA damage , proteomics metabolomics spinal fluid , blood urine , microarray analysis different nutritional deficiency subgroup , together routine diagnostics investigation undertaken memory clinic , nutritional assessment . The patient healthy control receive information result examination part routine investigation memory clinic , accord Norwegian Biotechnology Law permission National Committees Research Ethics Norway . In addition vitamin list primary outcome , follow measurement carry : 1 . Isoprostane measurement : The finding F2-α-isoprostane-increase cerebrospinal fluid close diseased organ , plasma , make important confirm finding . Isoprostane measurement CNS might become important parameter prospective treatment study actual treatment least normalize pathological finding . 2 . 8 hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine increase cerebrospinal fluid urine , reveal DNA-damage suggest mechanism AD development . 3 . Spinal fluid : Nutrients spinal fluid , expression increase peroxidation like F2-α-isoprostane , tau protein possibly LC/MS methodology metabolic pattern ( metabolomics ) different protein ( proteomics ) . - Proteomics ; determination protein profile . The emerge technology mass spectrometry ( MS ) -based quantitative proteomics provide powerful tool systematically quantitatively assess quantitative difference protein profile . Discovery base proteomics compare proteome diseased sample versus normal global scale , widely apply study various human disease goal identify biomarkers and/or reveal pathogenesis disease . In study , protein sample control diseased labeled different stable isotope , digest peptide analyzed LCMS . Quantitative difference proteins group perform state-of-the-art hybrid mass spectrometer , LTQ XL-Orbitrap . The Orbitrap instrument extremely high resolve power , mass accuracy sensitivity . - Metabonomics : Metabonomics aim measure mathematically model change metabolite concentration find biological fluid tissue . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy allow detection quantification compound large mixture , product metabolism biological fluid tissue . There hundred metabolite find cerebrospinal fluid , plasma , serum urine . NMR spectroscopy offer advantage measure concentration micromolar sensitivity conveniently require little sample preparation . In recent study involve large set spectra , variation result show small 2 % reflect high degree reproducibility . By identify pattern metabolic fingerprint organism , one study effect diet , drug disease use multivariate statistic principal component analysis partial least square attempt interpret NMR spectrum . 4 . Genetic analysis : m-RNA measurement SNP-profiles - DNA repair . - Active component process av APP Abeta . - Will include possible , sequence genome and/or GWAS .</detailed_description>
