	<brief_summary>Intestinal inflammation see inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) result alter mucosal immune response luminal bacterial antigen . Current research suggest inappropriate persistent immune response commensal intestinal bacterial flora play pivotal role pathogenesis chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . It also propose sign symptom IBD may mediate increase intestinal permeability secondary low grade inflammation gut mucosa . Increased intestinal permeability result exposure underlying intestinal mucosa luminal bacteria antigens perpetuate intestinal inflammation . Thus restore intestinal permeability rather reduction mucosal inflammation would thus desirable endpoint restoration mucosal integrity would harbinger good long term outcome . Many clinical trial show probiotic may beneficial effect IBD patient . Probiotics hypothesize work several mechanism though clearly establish . The role probiotic improve intestinal permeability evaluate . The probiotic VSL # 3 easily available , cheap , effective safe alternative substitute exist therapeutic agent evaluate study efficacy , tolerability , compliance induce clinical response patient Ulcerative colitis . This double blind randomize placebo control study determine clinical efficacy 12 week oral probiotic ( VSL # 3 ) patient inflammatory bowel disease . The objective study determine efficacy probiotic clinical endoscopic histological improvement , find improvement faecal , serum intestinal tissue inflammatory marker , improvement intestinal permeability , improvement Quality life parameter .</brief_summary>
