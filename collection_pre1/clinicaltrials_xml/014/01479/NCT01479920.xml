	<brief_summary>This randomize , assessor-blind , placebo control study major depressive disorder ( MDD ) patient . Subjects receive antidepressant drug ( FLX ) would assign receive either 18 sham / active DCEAS 6 week . Changes severity depressive symptom time measure use depression rating scale . Brain glucose metabolic level measure use PET baseline endpoint . The intriguing expect result might acupuncture treated-patients may display comparable even well outcomes clinical improvement acupuncture correlate restoration activity relate brain region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Positron Emission Topographic ( PET ) Study Depression Patient With Electroacupuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although development various class antidepressant drug , represent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , considerably improve prognosis tolerability treatment depressive disorder , currently available antidepressant therapy still incomplete , 40 % depressed individual obtain full response large proportion patient experience recurrent episode . Recently principal investigator complete clinical trial test whether dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation ( DCEAS ) could enhance antidepressant efficacy early phase SSRI treatment ( fluoxetine , FLX ) major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . It find DCEAS clinically safe effective augment antidepressant efficacy early SSRI treatment . As hypothesize normalize effect associate modulation various nervous function associate pathophysiology MDD , design neuroimaging ( PET ) DCEAS study delineate relate mechanism . The objective study : 1 ) To compare clinical improvement depressive symptom DCEAS FLX monotherapy MDD subject ; ( 2 ) To determine effect DCEAS treatment glucose metabolic level relate brain region comparison healthy control FLX-treated patient , use PET scanning ; ( 3 ) To correlate clinical improvement change PET-measured activity relate brain region pool subject treat DCEAS FLX . In 6-week , assessor-blind , randomize , control study DCEAS additional treatment antidepressant drug FLX , total 82 patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) recruit . The patient randomly assign FLX ( 10-30 mg/day ) combine sham ( n =41 ) FLX active DCEAS ( n =41 ) ( 18 session , 3 session week ) . Changes severity depressive symptom time measure use depressive instrument . Clinical response remission rate also calculate . Two session PET scan conduct baseline endpoint . The study conduct HKU School Chinese Medicine , Queen Mary Hospital , Kowloon Hospital , Hong Kong .</detailed_description>
