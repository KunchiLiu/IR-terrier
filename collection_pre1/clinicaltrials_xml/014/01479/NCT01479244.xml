	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study NeuVax™ ( Nelipepimut-S E75 ) Vaccine Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , multinational , prospective , randomize , double-blind , control Phase 3 study . The subject eligible trial early stage node-positive breast cancer . Their tumor express low intermediate level HER2 protein . NeuVax™ administer completion front-line , standard care therapy ( surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ) give concomitantly physician prescribed endocrine treatment . NeuVax™ immmunodominant nonapeptide derive extracellular domain HER2 protein , well-established target therapeutic intervention breast carcinoma . The nelipepimut sequence stimulates specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) follow bind HLA-A2/A3 molecule antigen present cell ( APC ) . These activate specific CTLs recognize , neutralize destroy cell lysis HER2 express cancer cell , include occult cancer cell micrometastatic focus . The nelipepimut immune response also generate CTLs immunogenic peptide inter- intra-antigenic epitope spread . Based successful Phase 2 trial , achieve primary endpoint DFS , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) grant NeuVax Special Protocol Assessment ( SPA ) Phase 3 PRESENT ( Prevention Recurrence Early-Stage , Node-Positive Breast Cancer Low Intermediate HER2 Expression NeuVax Treatment ) study . The active portion study last three year ( 36 month ) . The follow-up last 5 10 year . Endpoints : 1 . Primary efficacy endpoint : - 3-year DFS 2 . Secondary efficacy endpoint : - 5- 10-year DFS - 3-year OS - 5- 10-year OS - Safety profile , adverse event ( AEs ) - Patterns recurrence include Time recurrence ( TTR ) , time local recurrence ( TTLR ) , time distant recurrence ( TTDR ) , time bone metastasis ( TTBM ) Safety Assessments : Subjects assess every study visit safety endpoint , AEs , vital sign , physical examination laboratory data ; yearly follow-up survival include image study , ECGs , MUGA ECHO scan concomitant medication .</detailed_description>
