	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine intra-abdominal irrigation time cesarean delivery increase maternal GI discomfort without affect infection rate . We hypothesize avoid intra-operative irrigation time cesarean delivery decrease intra-operative nausea vomit without increase maternal infectious morbidity , post-operative pain , return bowel function , time discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-abdominal Cesarean Section : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize controlled trial . Based available literature clinical experience , expect twenty percent decrease gastrointestinal disturbance avoid intraoperative irrigation time cesarean section . With type 1 error rate set 0.05 power 0.90 ; require 184 patient arm ( irrigation versus irrigation ) obtain adequate sample size . Paper copy write consent identify information keep secure , lock file . All data collect stored password protect computer file accessible investigator . Patients identified time admission Labor Delivery unit . A physician discus study patient . After time consideration question answer patient consent trial . Consent obtain time admission Labor Delivery unit . If patient successful vaginal delivery patient enter study . If patient require cesarean section patient randomize either irrigation nonirrigation group . Assignment perform pull sequentially number opaque envelope contain computer-randomized individual allocation . This randomization carry research staff initiation study , patient blind treatment assign . Information regard basic demographic data , comorbidities may affect infection rate ( diabetes , hypertension , ect ) , intervention labor , post partum course obtain patient ' chart . The two arm differ intraoperative management patient delivery baby . Patients irrigation arm receive cesarean section irrigation abdominal cavity 500-1000mL warm normal saline closure uterine incision prior closure abdominal wall . In addition blood clot debris evacuate paracolic gutter , anterior posterior culdesacs , bladder flap . The nonirrigation group receive Joel-Cohen cesarean section without irrigation normal saline . This group also large debris include blood clot evacuate . Both group undergo standard closure abdominal wall , include reapproximation rectus muscle suture rectus fascia run nonlocking absorbable suture . Prefascial irrigation subcutaneous tissue superior close fascia do group . Staples absorbable suture use skin closure . In addition patient receive standardize dose 1 gram first generation cephalosporin 900mg clindamycin intravenously antibiotic prophylaxis time umbilical cord clamping . As per standard care , post partum care include vital sign every 4 hour include patient report pain level nausea , discontinuation foley catheter advancement diet postoperative day one , daily examination incision , notation return gastrointestinal function , early ambulation , complete blood count first postoperative day . The primary outcome measure maternal GI disturbance . This define nausea emesis cesarean section well nausea require medical intervention hospitalization . The time return bowel function also record . The secondary outcome measure incidence maternal infectious morbidity , define endometritis . This diagnose two follow present : abnormally tender uterus exam , temperature great 100.4Â°F time postoperatively , unexplained maternal tachycardia great 100 beat per minute . Patients also monitor wound infection daily visual inspection incision . Diagnosis make erythema , tenderness , discharge separation occur maternal fever . Post operative care provider blind group assignment avoid potential bias . The investigator collect data , perform data entry , review chart ensure accuracy information provide treat physician . Periodic review data entry perform ensure completeness accuracy .</detailed_description>
