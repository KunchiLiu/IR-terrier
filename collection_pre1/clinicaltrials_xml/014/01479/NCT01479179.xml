	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Combination With AMG 479 HER-2 Overexpressing MBC Progressing Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 Phase 2 Study : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Groups 3 participant enrol Phase 1 portion study . There 2 dose level test Phase 1 . If enrolled Phase 1 portion , dose AMG 479 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive high dose level AMG 479 . If intolerable side effect , next group receive low dose . If enrolled Phase 2 portion , receive AMG 479 high dose tolerate Phase 1 portion . All participant receive dose level trastuzumab . Study Drug Administration : You receive AMG 479 vein 60-120 minute Day 1 21-day cycle . You receive trastuzumab vein 30-90 minute Day 1 cycle . If already receive trastuzumab time join study , continue receive standard dose trastuzumab . If last dose trastuzumab give 1-3 week join study ( depend dose previously receive ) , receive high `` load '' dose trastuzumab follow standard dose . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect may . Your vital sign check , , infusion AMG 479 . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If Phase 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test 2 time ( study drug dose ) Day 1 Cycles 1 2 . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Your performance status update medical history record . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , CT MRI scan check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw blood sugar test . You need fast 8 hour test . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status update medical history record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . You PET-CT scan Week 3 PET-CT scan screening . On Day 8 Cycles 1-3 , blood ( 1Â½ teaspoon ) draw check blood clot function . Every 3 month , either ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . In certain case doctor 's permission , study visit may occur 1 day earlier later describe . If side effect , extra clinic visit may need . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End Treatment Visit : Within 30 day last study drug dose : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask side effect drug may take . - Any updates medical history record . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You hear test - If one last 30 day last treatment , ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . - If doctor think need , CT MRI scan check status disease . - If Phase 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn PK testing . This investigational study . Trastuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . AMG-479 FDA approve commercially available . AMG-479 currently use research purpose . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
