	<brief_title>Evaluating Immune Response rAd5 HIV Vaccine Administered Three Different Ways Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VRC rAd5 HIV vaccine contain four different component . In study , researcher examine immune system respond vaccine four component administer three different way : 1 . The vaccine dose contain four component give single injection one arm , placebo injection give arm leg . 2 . The vaccine dose contain four component divide fourth , one-fourth full dose give arm leg . 3 . The four vaccine component separate , different component give arm leg . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Participants randomly assign one three group . Group 1 receive entire dose vaccine right arm placebo vaccine arm leg . Group 2 receive four different component vaccine , give separately different component per arm leg . Group 3 receive entire vaccine dose divide fourth , one fourth full dose give arm leg . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination medical medication history review . Female participant also take pregnancy test . Participants complete questionnaire receive counsel HIV risk reduction pregnancy prevention . All participant receive vaccine give four injectionsâ€”one right arm , leave arm , right thigh , leave thigh ( except Group 1 , placebo injection give leave arm leg ) . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . For 7 day vaccination , participant record side effect symptom log ; first 3 day vaccination , study staff call participant ensure complete symptom log . Follow-up visit occur Months 1 , 4 , 7 . These visit include baseline study procedure blood collection . Participants contact study researcher year 5 year follow-up health monitoring . Blood collect study visit save future testing .</detailed_description>
