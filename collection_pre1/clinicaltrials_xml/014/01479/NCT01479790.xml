	<brief_summary>Dry eye common condition affect vision quality life patient . Dry eye clinical research limit follow disease progression . Currently , research outcome base subjective patient complaint rather objective assessment condition . Only objective measurement dry eye available today mainly result poor repeatability inaccuracy . This current study aim evaluate 2 new non-invasive imaging technique suitable dry eye assessment . Anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( AS-OCT ) image device ability image tear meniscus eye safe non-invasive manner . Image analysis indirectly determine tear film volume . Improvements image resolution device require study compare repeatability agreement older ( Visante AS-OCT ) newer instrument ( Cirrus AS-OCT ) current study aim address . Another method evaluate dry eye disease novel technique use functional infrared thermography measure tear evaporation rate . This study also establish repeatability measurement ocular surface temperature use calculate tear evaporation rate . Should methods found repeatable , used future clinical trial additional tool investigate dry eye treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Purpose : Part A - AS-OCT repeatability agreement 1 . The primary purpose Part A compare repeatability Cirrus Visante AS-OCT imaging system . 2 . The second objective identify level agreement tear meniscus measurement take Cirrus Visante AS-OCT. Part B - Tear evaporimetry functional infra-red thermography 1 . To evaluate repeatability Infrared thermography ocular surface temperature measurement use calculation tear evaporation rate . If find acceptable , correlate tear meniscus parameter . 2 . To determine whether method able detect temperature change ocular surface . Study design : Part A . Cross sectional study . Part B . Prospective study Rationale : Part A - AS-OCT repeatability agreement Repeatability important issue objective assessment dry eye . While previous study compare various method measure tear meniscus , include use Visante AS-OCT , current literature lack study investigate Cirrus AS-OCT assessment dry eye . With high resolution , Cirrus potentially useful non-invasive procedure objective measurement tear meniscus . Part B - Tear evaporimetry functional infra-red thermography Current available method measure tear evaporation rate major limitation . This new method , however , non-invasive , need special eye drop chamber take temperature measurement quickly . This method therefore extremely practical provide many excite possibility future trial . Methods : Participants target sample size 40 volunteer Singapore Eye Research Institute recruit study . Each volunteer give study serial number ensure anonymity . 20 participate AS-OCT study . 20 participate tear evaporimetry study . Part A - AS-OCT repeatability agreement Two AS-OCT image system , namely Cirrus Visante , test . All participant undergo acquisition 2 image Visante AS-OCT , 2 image Cirrus AS-OCT . Both image acquire technician . Part B - Tear evaporimetry functional infra-red thermography In total , four pair thermographic sequence ocluar surface temperature volunteer take . 1 . The volunteer seat front thermographic camera eye thermographic sequence capture . 2 . After 20 minute , second pair thermographic sequence capture . 3 . An eye mask temperature 40 deg C ( confirm thermometer ) wear volunteer 5 minute . 4 . A third pair thermographic sequence capture immediately mask removal . 5 . A fourth pair thermographic sequence capture 1 hour mask removal . Between sequence acquisition , volunteer allow move freely room . The temperature humidity room keep constant measurement . Visit schedule : Only one examination per ASOCT instrument Part A require . For Part B , thermography perform day . If participant agree ASOCT tear evaporimetry do , undergo Parts A B . If , recruit either Part A Part B . Duration study : 1 day</detailed_description>
