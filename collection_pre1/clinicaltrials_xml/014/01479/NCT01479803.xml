	<brief_summary>The negative predictive value fine needle aspiration ultrasound endoscopy ( EUS ) diagnostic solid pancreatic mass 70 % average current literature 22 gauge needle . There wide variability rate across study ( 38 92 % ) . In case negativity biopsy , risk miss pancreatic cancer whose prognosis severe extensive treatment , remain important . To improve sensitivity EUS echo endoscopy , several method use . A new needle ( Echo Tip ® HD ProCore ™ ) receive CE Mark field EUS . This instrument combine comfortable handy size 22 Gauge innovative design ( window lateralize bevel ) vitro study obtain core biopsy . In addition , single pas tumor achieve hand several ( 2-3 minimum ) current hardware . The theoretical goal tissue material abundant sampling , without increase morbidity increase diagnostic accuracy . A preliminary prospective study material show interesting result ( increase diagnostic accuracy 15 % ) . To determine diagnostic gain new hand , seem essential propose prospective comparative study ( 22 gauge needle ProCore ™ versus old EchoTip ® 22-Gauge ) randomize ( randomization order needle ) crossover ( lesion ) sample pancreatic solid tumor . The caliber 22 gauge gauge often use puncture ultrasound endoscopy , result less morbidity . Puncture 2 needle injury limit effect variability patient thereby good power investigator study without increase risk complication ( needle ProCore ™ require one pas tumor ) . The study pancreatic solid tumor one pose big diagnostic problem still present investigator daily practice . The aim study compare diagnostic accuracy needle ProCore™ versus EchoTip® etiological cyto histological diagnostic pancreatic solid tumor EUS .</brief_summary>
