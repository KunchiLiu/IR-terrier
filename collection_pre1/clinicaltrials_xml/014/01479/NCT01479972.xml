	<brief_summary>Goal VPM development recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin express BCG vaccine strain ( VPM1002 ) safe , well tolerate efficacious vaccine tuberculosis ( TB ) resident endemic area person risk non-endemic area . The new vaccine least potent current strain safer BCG ( Kaufmann , 2007a ; Grode et al. , 2005 ) . The vaccine formulate live lyophilised bacteria re-suspended intradermal injection . The precede clinical trial 80 volunteer Germany 24 volunteer Bloemfontein , South Africa indicate immunogenicity safety sufficient proceed clinical development newborn infant . Hence , current study commence Stellenbosch University , South Africa . This first investigation VPM1002 newborn infant .</brief_summary>
