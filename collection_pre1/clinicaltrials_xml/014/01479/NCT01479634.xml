	<brief_title>Early HIV Therapy Patients With High CD4 Cell Counts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After dramatic progress recent year , HIV care patient resource limited setting rapidly evolve new model care delivery . Governments , non-governmental organization charitable foundation place increase scrutiny programmatic cost associate deliver antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Given reality , global ART roll-out continue successfully , must develop innovative new way provide HIV care ART efficient , cost-effective , tightly integrate within country-level health system . We must treat patient few resource , need sustainable simple model ART delivery . These goal accomplish build several exist knowledge point . First , initiate ART early disease stag high CD4+ cell count may prevent irreversible immunologic damage , prevent opportunistic infection non-AIDS-associated morbidity , may prevent death . International national HIV policy body increasingly recognize adjust recommendation direction . Second , ART initiation high CD4+ cell count less complex , trigger fewer complication , less costly healthcare system . Third , patient respond therapy well require few physician-administered follow-up visit . This allow `` task-shifting '' non-MD provider , establishment tiered healthcare delivery spectrum medical acuity . Fourth , lack viral load monitoring responsible major structural problem deliver ART , cause delay recognize ART failure , prevent clinician diagnose HIV drug resistance , make decision switch patient new ART regimen error-prone . The EARLI study pilot study address investigate critical issue . This study focus exclusively asymptomatic patient CD4 cell count ≥250 cells/uL . These relatively healthier individual well suit streamline approach ART delivery healthcare provision . Primary Objectives : A . To evaluate 48 week efficacy ART initiate asymptomatic individual high CD4+ cell count ( CD4+ &gt; 250 cells/uL ) provide `` streamline '' mode care . B . To evaluate programmatic cost streamline ART delivery asymptomatic high CD4+ count individual . Secondary Objectives : A . To evaluate 96 week efficacy ART initiate high CD4+ cell count individual . B . To identify predictor retention care among high CD4+ cell count ART initiator . C. To assess adverse event among high CD4+ cell count ART initiator . D. To assess medication adherence among high CD4+ cell count ART initiator .</detailed_description>
