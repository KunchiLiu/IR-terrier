	<brief_summary>The investigator investigate 1. relationship oxidative stress- , apoptosis-related marker , mitochondrion DNA copy number clinical psychopathology schizophrenia , include severity positive negative symptom , obesity metabolic syndrome . 2. relationship aberrant mitochondrion gene ( single nucleotide polymorphism D-loop region-related gene haplogroup N9a ) , DISC1 gene polymorphism , clinical phenotype Taiwanese population . 3. whether biological marker could clinical marker schizophrenia long-term follow-up study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past study , show significant difference serum Lpo ( lipid peroxidation ) Thiol level patient schizophrenia healthy control . For patient take risperidone , significant decrease serum Thiol level . In addition , also significant difference age onset PPAR gamma coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α ) polymorphism schizophrenia patient . Therefore , want know relationship oxidative stress- , apoptosis-related marker , mitochondrion DNA copy number clinical psychopathology schizophrenia , include severity positive negative symptom , obesity metabolic syndrome . In past study , also find significant difference 10 SNPs locate D-loop region-related gene patient healthy control . Three SNPs could find Mitomap data , another seven SNPs find Mitomap could confirm . In addition , Tanaka et al . find haplogroup N9a relate diabetes metabolic syndrome Asia . Therefore , interested clarify relationship relate mitochondrion gene clinical phenotype Taiwanese population , . In addition , also want see whether biological marker could clinical marker schizophrenia long-term follow-up study .</detailed_description>
