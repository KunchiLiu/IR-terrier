	<detailed_description>Retinoids study chemo preventive compound clinical trial acknowledge role regulate cell growth , differentiation apoptosis preclinical model . Induction apoptosis unique feature fenretinide ( 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide , 4-HPR ) , ( 2 ) widely study retinoid clinical trial breast cancer chemoprevention selective accumulation breast tissue low toxicity . The fifteen-year follow randomize phase III trial fenretinide prevent second breast cancer indicate fenretinide induced 17 % , durable reduction second breast cancer incidence . When stratify menopausal status , analysis show 38 % , statistically significant reduction second breast cancer premenopausal woman protective effect persist 15 year , i.e . 10 year treatment cessation . Importantly , young woman , great trend benefit fenretinide , remarkable 50 % risk reduction woman age 40 year young , whereas benefit disappear age 55 . One explanation different effect fenretinide accord menopausal status age different modulation circulate IGF-I premenopausal postmenopausal woman , reduction IGF-I level premenopausal subject . When consider protective activity fenretinide second breast cancer young woman similar trend ovarian cancer ( latter least intervention ) ( 4 , 5 ) , appear young woman high risk germ line BRCA-1 2 mutation high family risk may ideal candidate investigation retinoid . Indeed , fenretinide highly effective inhibit growth BRCA-1 mutate breast cancer cell line . Since reduction second breast cancer might surrogate marker primary prevention , favourable effect fenretinide provide strong rationale primary prevention trial unaffected woman high-risk breast cancer . Importantly , clinically relevant dos , fenretinide show induce NO-mediated apoptosis human murine BRCA-1 mutate cancer cell , In ability fenretinide potent phenylretinamide analogue BRCA-1 mutate breast cancer cell . Additionally , recent study show 4-HPR modulates gene expression ovarian cell , up-regulation expression proapoptotic gene OVCA433 cell down-regulation mutant BRCA gene IOSE ( premalignant ) cell OVCA433 cell . This suggest preventive effect premalignant cell treatment effect cancer cell . Increasing evidence sustains link rise prevalence metabolic syndrome Western world breast cancer incidence . The retinol-binding protein 4 ( RBP4 ) , adipocyte-secreted molecule , specific transport protein retinol blood correlate component metabolic syndrome , include increase body-mass index , waist-to-hip ratio , serum triglyceride . Plasma concentration RBP4 know decrease proportionally retinol fenretinide administration normalization RBP4 fenretinide insulin-resistant obese mouse show improve insulin action glucose tolerance . Among molecular biomarker candidate malignant tumour , cell-free DNA circulate serum promising . Unlike uniformly truncate DNA release apoptotic cell , DNA release dead cancer cell vary size . Serum DNA integrity ratio long fragment total DNA may clinically useful detect breast cancer progression . Since free-circulating DNA non-invasive approach detect cancer patient disease-free individual , interest study use early detection biomarker . Breast cancer chemoprevention rapidly evolve , strong evidence primary chemoprevention possible . The establish preventive agent far SERMs ( selective estrogen receptor modulators ) , AIs ( aromatase inhibitor ) currently investigation postmenopausal population . All drug involve directly hormonal pathway pathogenesis disease , target likely limited hormone responsive tumour . Tamoxifen great effect chemo preventive agent may serious side effect , raloxifene may better toxicity profile , especially concern risk endometrial cancer , test post menopause . Fenretinide show possess several good property preclinical model clinical trial . In particular , prolonged effect demonstrate phase III trial chemopreventive trial breast cancer subject , together trend protective effect ovary , accompany low toxicity profile ( mainly reversible skin dryness rash dark adaptation difficulty , often overcome monthly weekend suspension drug ) . All characteristic make fenretinide excellent candidate chemoprevention cohort young healthy woman high susceptibility early onset breast ovarian cancer , carry BRCA 1/2 mutation significant family risk . Since drug activity probably strictly influence hormonal responsiveness , possible may effect also hormone non-responsive cancer , may useful particularly case BRCA1 mutation carrier . Side effect toxicity : visual symptom ( diminish dark adaptability , dryness lacrimation ) report approximately 20 % subject . These symptom may occur frequently start intervention tend recover time often without need treatment discontinuation . A regular three-days/month drug suspension adopt long time clinical study minimize visual impairment . Although side effect many woman manageable ( especially follow regular three day suspension ) reversible , must remember dark adaptability impairment might potentially dangerous certain situation drive bright sun dark tunnel night drive . Dermatological disorder , skin mucosal dryness , pruritus urticaria detect 18 % subject . Mild gastrointestinal symptom report around 13 % patient . Interestingly , exception ocular surface disorder , incidence adverse effect seem decrease time significantly frequent postmenopausal woman . Liver toxicity increase blood lipid level , especially triglyceride , report consistently literature . Like retinoids , fenretinide may potentially teratogenic , although available study show genotoxic effect vitro vivo , lack storage human embryo . Thus , appropriate measure contraception adopt treat potentially fertile woman .</detailed_description>
