	<brief_summary>Electroporation combine chemotherapy ( ECT ) show effective treatment breast cancer spread skin . In routine clinical practise , ECT offer patient treatment option exhaust . This study test hypothesis early treatment ECT may result improved local control skin metastasis , improve quality life reduce health care cost . Patients randomise either ECT give early possible course disease delay ECT least 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient &gt; 18 year age Histological confirm breast cancer Metastatic breast cancer ( skin lesion consider metastatic disease ) Prior histological confirmation least one skin lesion Skin lesion must depth great 3 cm ( measure clinically possible otherwise basis CT/ultrasound examination Confluent skin metastasis individual lesion hard define entirety may exceed maximum area 10 x 10 cm area confluence . If several area confluence , patient may include study provide lesion treat within time constraint single ECT session ( 20 minute ) . Not ten skin lesion . Each area confluence consider one lesion . A single skin lesion may exceed 5 cm Patients may receive one line systemic treatment ( chemotherapy endocrine therapy ) metastatic disease follow discovery skin metastasis . Patients develop skin metastasis first time ongoing systemic therapy may receive one additional line systemic treatment prior inclusion . Patients early ECT arm may receive cancer treatment discretion treat physician start earlier 2 week follow ECT . This ensure patient metastatic disease location receive treatment consider suitable regardless participation trial . ( If 2 week ECT start systemic treatment judge long treat physician , patient enter trial ) . Women childbearing age must practice suitable form contraception . A life expectancy least 6 month . Patients ECOG performance status &lt; 3 Signed Informed Consent Patients extensive rapidly progressive visceral metastasis delay systemic therapy eventual ECT judge patient ` best interest Patients , medical reason , give bleomycin Patients brain metastasis treat surgery and/or radiotherapy progressive disease brain two month treatment Prior cumulative dose bleomycin exceed 250,000 IU/m2 Less 14 day previous cancer treatment ( either local systemic ) If patient skin lesion situate close proximity pacemaker electrical field ECT overlap pacemaker , pacemaker must move another location order patient able participate study Chronic renal failure ( serum creatinine &gt; 150 mol/L ) Inadequate liver function define : ASAT ALAT &gt; 2.5 x ULN absence liver metastases &gt; 5 presence liver metastases Bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN ( except case Gilberts Syndrome ) Albumin &lt; 25 g/L â€¢ Inadequate bone marrow reserve define : White blood cell count &lt; 3 X 109/L Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 X109/L Platelet count &lt; 100 X 109/L Any severe uncontrolled systemic disease .
