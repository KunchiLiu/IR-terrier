	<brief_summary>The goal project improve efficiency train assessment technical skill surgical treatment otologic disease . Through previous funding , develop intuitive virtual simulation environment use adjuvant teach temporal bone surgery . Using direct-volume visualization technique integrate stereoscopic display , haptic ( force ) feedback , aural simulation , achieve straightforward , low-cost learning environment ready translation practical training assessment tool . This application challenge seek shift current practice clinical training translate simulation environment vehicle curriculum development , technical skill assessment , dissemination . The intent provide accessible , inexpensive , safe , deliberate practice objective continuous quantitative , objective assessment early stage train .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Temporal Bone Surgery : Defining Translating Metrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim research include : 1 ) definition standardize metric otological surgical technique , 2 ) translation standard objective criterion use computer synthesize surgical environment , 3 ) correlation expert evaluation computer automate assessment resident proficiency . The interaction computer-based include : Experts learn use system evaluate quality translation metric simulation environment . Evaluations form anonymous web-based survey . Experts serve focus group . Residents use simulation environment perform surgical procedure virtual specimen . Residents evaluate quality simulation environment via anonymous web-based survey . Experts use simulation environment evaluate rate resident performance . The computer environment use automatically assess rate resident performance . Expert computer assessment compare .</detailed_description>
