	<brief_summary>In particular circumstance T cell effective treatment malignant disease , example , donor lymphocyte infusion follow allogeneic transplant treatment EBV relate lymphomas post allograft . However , many common cancer poorly recognise immune system part lack suitable T cell target part defect antigen presentation tumour ( Garrido , et al 1997 ) . Genetically modify T cell engineer express chimeric immune receptor ( CIRs ) cell surface bypass need MHC presentation thus represent attractive approach immunotherapy ( Gross , et al 1989 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study CD19 Specific T Cells CD19 Positive Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 Immunoglobulin-like 95kDa glycoprotein express B lymphocytes differentiation terminal effector cell ( Tedder Isaacs 1989 ) . It play important role regulate cell signal threshold also costimulatory molecule B cell receptor signal ( Tedder , et al 1997 ) . CD19 present majority B-CLL , B-ALL , low high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . It rarely lose process neoplastic transformation express haematopoetic stem cell . B cell malignancy often highly responsive chemotherapy , cure possible significant number high grade tumour . However , improve treatment need low grade tumour high grade tumour relapse conventional therapy . In recent year introduction Rituximab , CD20 monoclonal antibody , clinical practice increase option available treatment NHL ( Maloney , et al 1994 ) . The success Rituximab monoclonal antibody demonstrate B cell malignancy may particularly suitable target immunotherapy . However , number potential advantage T cell engineer express CIR monoclonal antibody therapy . Firstly , possibility vivo T cell persistence expansion may enable stable expression CIR prolong period time ( Walker , et al 2000 ) . Secondly , home tumour site may mean T cell need rely diffusion achieve localisation ( Balkwill 2004 , Mitsuyasu , et al 2000 ) thirdly follow tumour recognition T cell produce cytokine may recruit activate effector cell . An alternative CIR engineer T cell generation peptide specific T cell . Lymphoma model suggest effective ( Armstrong , et al 2002 , Armstrong , et al 2004 ) , produce clinically applicable number T cell technically demand lack generic peptide target antigens lymphoma . One potential problem use CIR engineer T cell general tumour associate antigen frequently express low level normal tissue , thus provide potential autoimmunity . Targeting B cell malignancy CD19 specific T cell attractive whilst CD19 express B cell majority B cell malignancy express cell type . It clear clinical use anti-CD20 antibody prolong depletion B cell ( &gt; 6 month ) safe ( Plosker Figgitt 2003 ) even patient hereditary B cell deficiency immunoglobulin infusion restore normal health patient ( Ochs Smith 1996 ) . The Investigators therefore propose clinical trial use T cell express CD19 target CIR retroviral transduction CIR activate T cell order target B cell malignancy .</detailed_description>
