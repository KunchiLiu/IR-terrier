	<brief_summary>In recent year hip resurface become popular alternative treatment total hip replacement treatment hip arthritis . This procedure become particularly common young patient arthritis perceive benefit term functional outcome . However , recently become apparent hip resurface associate range adverse event , typically see patient conventional hip replacement . These include hip fracture , failure bone grow onto fixation surface implant . It also become apparent hip resurface result release high concentration dissolve metal bloodstream , cobalt chromium . Whilst small concentration metal essential normal body function , make red blood cell , high concentration effect toxic many cell organ body , bone , brain , heart , liver kidney , well disturb hormone blood cholesterol level . Whilst several study document level metal ion 440 time normal level hip resurface patient , study examine whether level toxic effect various organ system body ( exception renal function ) . In study plan explore whether difference bone mineral density , accumulation metal ion brain , solid organ , heart hormonal function subject hip resurface 5 year previously compare individually match group subject conventional hip replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross sectional survey patient hip resurface ( MOMHR ) subject receive conventional hip replacement ( THA ) use metal plastic ceramic bearing . Participants study identify orthopaedic surgeon operate database . An invitation letter send potential participant accompany information sheet reply slip . If response one letter sent . Those patient respond say interested take part study telephone study team screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . If eligible willing take part discussion investigator , appointment make attend give inform consent . Participants request eat drink morning attend visit . There opportunity visit discussion explanation study requirement Investigator consent give . Once consent give , follow procedure carry visit ( Visit 1 ) : 1 . Venous blood take venepuncture ( 60 mL , approx 4 tablespoon , take ) participant able eat breakfast ( provide ) . 2 . A urine base pregnancy test use woman child bearing age exclude pregnant woman 3 . Participants complete Oxford Hip questionnaire , EQ5D questionnaire record medical history concomitant medicine supervision student investigator experience research nurse . 4 . Whole body bone mineral density assessment make use Hologic Discovery bone densitometer . This take approximately 10 minute total carry experienced research bone density technician 5 . An electrocardiogram echocardiogram perform experienced cardiotechnician later analyse Consultant Cardiologist 6 . Participants give container instruction collect 24 hour urine sample . This returned second visit 7 . An appointment make participant attend second visit Royal Hallamshire Hospital . At visit 2 follow procedure carry : 1 . Neuropsychological assessment questionnaires visual acuity measurement use Snellen chart . 2 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain use 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner . 3 . MRI liver spleen kidney use 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner . Clinical report prepare clinical investigation normal finding relate patient letter . Abnormal finding report GP patient advice action necessary .</detailed_description>
