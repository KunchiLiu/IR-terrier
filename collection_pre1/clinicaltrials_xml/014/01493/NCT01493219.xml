	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To learn ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 NGAL ) substances find blood urine associate tumor , use tumor marker management treatment glioblastoma . 2 . To study relationship MMP-2 , MMP-9 NGAL quality life disease symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Prognosis Glioblastoma ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -2 -9 belong multigene family degradative enzymes implicated neoangiogenesis require tumor growth . In central nervous system ( CNS ) , MMP-2 , MMP-9 neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) overexpressed orthotopic model also human brain tumor specimen . Furthermore , serum urinary level marker show correlate presence status brain tumor type primary brain tumor . A major challenge treatment primary brain tumor dependence magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) differentiate disease progression treatment-related change . This particularly challenging glioblastoma ( GBM ) multimodality therapy radiation chemotherapy commonly use lead pseudoprogression treatment-related tissue necrosis , masquerade true tumor progression . Often face decision treat base imaging finding alone recommend patient another invasive surgery . We hypothesize MMP-2 , MMP-9 NGAL : 1 ) detect tumor tissue immunohistochemistry non-tumor ( epilepsy ) brain tissue , 2 ) parallel course disease urine and/or serum patient 3 ) remain unchanged event pseudoprogression treatment relate imaging change . Quality life , patient symptom , cognitive function vitally important patient GBM . Quality life select symptom also assess correlate serum urine biomarkers . We hope confirm utility MMP-2 , MMP-9 NGAL management GBM .</detailed_description>
