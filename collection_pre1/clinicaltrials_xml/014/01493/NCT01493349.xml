	<brief_summary>Colonic diverticular disease highly prevalent condition Western population . The prevalence increase age-dependently 5 % 40 year 65 % age 85 year ( 1-3 ) . The majority remain asymptomatic . However , significant proportion patient population develop complication , diverticulitis without symptom ( 10-20 % ) ( 1 , 4-10 ) . Perforated diverticulitis rare estimate incidence 4 per 100.000 per year , associate mortality rate 22 % 39 % ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) . In United States , complication relate diverticular disease account 130.000 hospitalization year , result substantial health care cost ( 13 ) . In Europe , estimate approximately 23.600 death per year attribute complicate diverticular disease , mortality probably increase future due age population ( 15-17 ) . Several case study report overall increase incidence diverticulitis , base increase hospitalization ( 18 ) . Kang et al , report 16 % increase male admission rate 12 % female admission rate diverticulitis , 1989/1990 1999/2000 ( 19 ) . Aging Western diet , low fiber high fat , combination increase intraluminal pressure alteration colonic motility consider important etiological factor . A disturbance large bowel motility suggest common pathophysiological feature IBS diverticular disease ( 20 , 21 ) . Based observation IBD , subgroup IBS ( symptomatic ) diverticular disease share clinical symptom , hypothesis derive might also share pathophysiological factor like low grade inflammation , change microbiota composition activity , increase intestinal permeability . The identification clinical pathophysiological factor associate increase risk complicate diverticular disease may help identify patient diverticular disease , prevent complication , develop strategy improve quality life reduce relate health care cost . Therefore aim investigate composition luminal mucosal intestinal microbiota intestinal permeability development diverticular disease complicate diverticular disease . We hypothesize intestinal microbiota intestinal permeability alter patient ( current- previous history complicate ) diverticular disease .</brief_summary>
