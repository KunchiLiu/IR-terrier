	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Kappaproct Chronic Active Treatment Refractory Ulcerative Colitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomise study ass efficacy safety Kappaproct add-on current practice treatment refractory ulcerative colitis patient . The study population chronic active ulcerative colitis patient longer respond adequately standard therapy potential candidate colectomy . Kappaproct/placebo add-on treatment allow include patient concomitant medication , well mandatory steroid inclusion , throughout study . Kappaproct ( DIMS0150 ) modify single strand DNA-based synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide 19 base length . The drug function immunomodulatory agent target Toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) present immune cell ( i.e. , B-cells pDCs ) reside high abundance mucosal surface , colonic nasal mucosa . The mucosa colon rectum patient ulcerative colitis contains active immune cell , produce damage tissue . The activation cell Kappaproct result systemic release specific cytokine ( e.g. , IL-10 type I interferon ) chemokines believe important factor clinical effect Kappaproct . Ex vivo experiment Kappaproct demonstrate drug ability enhance steroid sensitivity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) obtain steroid refractory UC patient . Thus , desire effect restore steroid sensitivity steroid refractory patient may benefit anti-inflammatory action steroid ultimately become steroid free . 120 eligible patient randomly assign 2:1 allocation receive two single rectal dos Kappaproct 30 mg , placebo , week 0 4 . The primary endpoint induction clinical remission week 12 patient continuously follow efficacy safety 12 month first dose . Secondary endpoint include induction symptomatic remission ( number stool blood stool ) , induction registration remission ( clinical endoscopic remission ) rate colectomy .</detailed_description>

Patients disease limited rectum ( ulcerative proctitis ) also exclude . 2 . History presence clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , haematological , endocrine , neurological , psychiatric disease , immune compromise state judge relevant investigator . 3 . Patients acute fulminant UC and/or sign systemic toxicity extent require immediate surgical action . 4 . History presence colonic malignancy and/or dysplasia . 5 . Concomitant treatment cyclosporine , tacrolimus , antiTNFs similar immunosuppressants/immunomodulators allow discontinue 4 week enrolment . Patients fail washout criterion undergo washout rescreened later time point . 6 . Treatment antibiotic NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) within two week enrolment . 7 .
