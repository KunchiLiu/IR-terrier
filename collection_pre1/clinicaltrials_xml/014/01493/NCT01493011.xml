	<brief_summary>Millions patient die non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) every year . There several method treat NSCLC , include surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy bioimmuotherapy . Recently , hyperthermia therapy play important role neoplasm therapy . It show effect NSCLC animal experiment clinical practice , yet little literature Whole-body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) neoplasm . The investigator decide develop randomize contrasted multicenter clinical study testify effect chemotherapy combine WBH treat stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
