	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Zirconium Silicate Chronic Kidney Disease Moderate Kidney Dysfunction With Mild Hyperkalemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 90 subject moderate CKD ( define GFR 40- 60ml/min ) mild hyperkalemia ( S-K 5-6 mmol/l ) enrol study , double-blind dose-escalating fashion ( three separate cohort ) , randomize receive one dose ZS ( 0.3g , 3g 10g ) placebo , administer 3 time ( tid ) daily meal . The first cohort 18 subject second third cohort 36 subject total 90 subject . Safety tolerability assess Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) completion cohort , escalation next dose level allow . The next dose escalation happen sooner one week last dose study drug previous dose level administer . Safety stop rule specify study . Within first dose level ( 300 mg dose ) , 12 subject randomize receive ZS , whereas 6 subject randomize receive placebo total 18 subject first cohort . In next two cohort ( 3 g 10 g dos ) , 24 subject per cohort randomize receive ZS , whereas 12 subject per cohort randomize receive placebo total 36 subject second third cohort .</detailed_description>
