	<brief_summary>Female urinary incontinence ( UI ) cause pure stress UI ( SUI ) , pure urgency UI ( UUI ) mix SUI UUI ( MUI ) . Clinically might easy separate MUI SUI . Patients might perceive urgency incompetent urethra full bladder . Urinary tract nerve growth factor ( NGF ) produce bladder urothelium smooth muscle . Increased level NGF report bladder tissue urine patient overactive bladder ( OAB ) . If urinary level NGF differ among woman pure SUI MUI , urinary NGF level might biomarker differential diagnosis MUI woman . Also , decrease urinary NGF level report OAB patient symptom improve . So , might expect remnant OAB symptom include urgency incontinence improve , urinary NGF level decrease midurethral sling SUI MUI patient . We aim explore value urinary NGF biomarker differential diagnosis prognostic marker predict improvement OAB symptom midurethral sling .</brief_summary>
