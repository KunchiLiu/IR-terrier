	<brief_summary>The purpose study see take medication lower amount oxidant food go body . Previous research show investigator low oxidant food people diabetes , simple change lower different risk heart disease worsen kidney disease . The investigator focus specific type oxidant , advanced glycation endproducts ( AGEs ) . A previous , small study , conduct group show drug , already approve FDA , low AGEs investigator compare Renvela® Tums® . Both drug side effect use long time patient diabetes kidney disease . While previous study interesting , small able sure help people diabetes , good effect investigator find simply due chance . The investigator new study confirm deny possibility Renvela® really help people diabetes kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Sevelamer Carbonate Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) level elevate diabetic patient patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) may contribute excessive cardiovascular disease population , promote oxidant stress chronic vascular inflammation . It recently recognize AGEs body originate endogenously , also ingestion preform AGEs diet . We show reduction dietary AGE intake lead significant reduction circulate AGEs insulin level well level marker oxidative stress inflammation diabetic CKD patient . Thus , increase inflammation oxidative stress ( Infl/OS ) stable diabetes mellitus ( DM ) largely due advance glycation end product ( AGEs ) food , restrict AGEs-intake reduces risk factor DM . High circulate AGEs TNFR1/2 show associated progression diabetic nephropathy . Ideally , compound bind food AGEs within lumen intestine effect dietary restriction AGEs could become important therapeutic tool clinical care patient . We find Sevelamer bind AGEs vitro pH dependent manner . This lead u hypothesize sevelamer carbonate , calcium carbonate , would sequester AGEs gut reduce Infl/OS , include circulate AGEs TNFα , T2DM Stage 2-4 CKD . This hypothesis test Pilot Study ( GCO-08-0976 ) design proof-of-concept trial determine large longer trial indicated . We conduct randomize , open-label , intention-to-treat , two-month crossover study compare stable diabetic patient stage 2-4 CKD treat either Sevelamer carbonate calcium carbonate 2 month , 1 week wash-out , opposite drug 2 month . There change medication food intake . We find urinary phosphate excretion decrease Sevelamer carbonate calcium carbonate . Serum AGEs , lipid , HbA1c , FGF23 , 8-isoprostanes reduce Sevelamer carbonate compare calcium carbonate . In addition , PMNC level AGER1 , SIRT1 TNFα also decrease Sevelamer carbonate , compare calcium carbonate . We conclude Sevelamer carbonate reduces HbA1c , FGF23 , lipid , TNFα via reduce inflammation OS stage 2-4 diabetic CKD . These change see calcium carbonate . Since find sevelamer carbonate bound AGE-BSA ( BSA ) pH 7.0 , pH 1.0 vitro , propose mechanism action sequestration dietary AGEs GI elimination . Based data , conclude large longer trial indicate confirm result . The current study proposes confirm Sevelamer Carbonate , agent know prevent gastrointestinal absorption phosphate , also able block absorption AGEs improve certain aspect diabetes chronic renal disease large group patient follow long period time .</detailed_description>
