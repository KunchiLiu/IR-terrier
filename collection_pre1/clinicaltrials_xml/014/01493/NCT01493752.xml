	<brief_summary>Diets rich fruit vegetable reduce risk stroke heart attack , however exact cause beneficial effect uncertain . Evidence suggest certain vegetable , include beetroot green leafy vegetable , possess high inorganic nitrate concentration . The investigator recent evidence suggest inorganic nitrate provide source gas call nitric oxide body exerts number beneficial effect upon heart blood vessel . The investigator previously show beetroot juice ingestion improve blood vessel ( vascular endothelial ) platelet function healthy volunteer . Studies investigator show effect due conversion nitrate nitrite symbiotic ( helpful ) bacteria ( locate tongue ) subsequent conversion nitrite nitric oxide blood vessel . The investigator wish explore whether dietary nitrate , via beneficial effect platelet blood vessel , might improve index atherosclerotic disease progression high risk individual ( hypercholesterolemics ) . Recruits high cholesterol know atherosclerosis yet anti-cholesterol medication . Volunteers consume daily dose beetroot juice placebo nitrate-free juice six week . Vascular function assess use non-invasive technique begin end study use ultrasound measurement flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) brachial artery arm pulse wave analysis ( PWA ) pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) measure arterial compliance . To assess impact platelet function , blood sample also take start end study .</brief_summary>
