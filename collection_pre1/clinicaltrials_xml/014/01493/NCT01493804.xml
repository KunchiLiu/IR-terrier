	<brief_summary>Background : - Different region brain activate person performs task . Electroencephalograms ( EEGs ) near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) test detect change brain . EEG look change electrical signal , NIRS look change blood flow . These test detect local change brain activity safe noninvasive way . Researchers want study brain activity closely combine test . Objectives : - To use EEG NIRS study brain activity specific task . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants one five testing session . Each session 1 2 hour long . The test give session determine researcher . - Participants EEG NIRS test , give either separately together . During test , participant perform task think reason . - Participants may also complete optional test think reason . These test give paper computer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To record near-infrared optical signal ( NIRS ) simultaneously EEG signal correlate hemodynamic neuronal response , understand brain connectivity associate cognitive function use combine EEG/NIRS technology Study population : 40 healthy volunteer Design : The study aim capture dynamic brain interaction two different scale comb EEG ( neuronal ) NIRS ( hemodynamic ) technique . We correlate two response study brain connectivity comprehensive way . Outcome Measures : grade change blood flow blood oxygenation , measure NIRS , along electrical signal record EEG response different functional task . Note : This study sponsor Center Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine ( CNRM ) . De-identified data include image data send CNRM may share outside investigator collaborator . This data may use variety research purpose . The Henry M. Jackson Foundation Advancement Military Medicine ( HJF ) , USUHS , DOD representative may also access data audit purpose .</detailed_description>
