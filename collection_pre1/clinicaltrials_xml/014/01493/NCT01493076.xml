	<brief_summary>Precut-sphincterotomy well establish alternative repeat futile attempt common bile duct ( CBD ) cannulation standard catheter and/or guide-wires fail . Commonly used device instrument pre-cutting needle-knife Erlangen-type precut-sphincterotome . In 1996 call `` baby-sphincterotome '' ( Easy-CutÂ® , MTW , Wesel , Germany ) pre-shaped-bended ( facilitate biliary access ) small-calibre 3-French tip develop , enable cannulation pre-cutting one step .

	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Newly Developed Baby-sphincterotome Bile Duct Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional procedure bile pancreatic duct require selective cannulation desire duct sometimes endoscopic sphincterotomy ( ES ) . If possible achieve selective access desire duct , occur 10-33 % case ( 1-4 ) , next step ensure selective cannulation so-called pre-cut procedure ( 5-8 ) . For approach needle knife Erlangen-type sphincterotome use perform pre-cut sphincterotomy ( PCS ) . This pre-cut technique show effective especially obtain selective bile duct access majority case whenever standard cannulation technique fail . However , report complication rate PCS substantially high conventional ES ( 9 ) , may outweigh clinical benefit . A limitation PCS-procedure need use dedicate instrument ( either needle knife Erlangen-type sphincterotome ) indication . After completion pre-cut procedure routinely attempt access desire duct perform accessory since pre-cut-sphincterotomes allow contrast injection guide-wire insertion . A change instrument PCS prolongs procedure time increase cost . Therefore `` universal '' instrument design bile duct cannulation precutting would substantially simplify procedure . In 1999 investigator describe newly develop `` baby '' -sphincterotome combine feature cannulate catheter Erlangen-type precut-papillotome . In first series patient device find useful direct cannulation well precut procedure ( 10 ) . The aim trial investigate safety efficacy newly develop baby-sphincterotome case fail selective wire-guided bile duct cannulation large cohort patient . Inclusion criterion : evidence bile duct obstruction visible stone tumor , dilate common bile duct &gt; 7 mm ( &gt; 9 mm cholecystectomised patient ) ultrasonography CT-scan MRCP/EUS , elevate serum bilirubin level &gt; 1.4 mg/dl , serum alkaline phosphatase &gt; 200 U/l clinical suspicion obstruction without evidence cholestatic liver disease . Patients severe coagulation disorder distort anatomy major papilla ( malignant infiltration papilla , papillary porus identifiable , impacted stone ) patient former gastro-duodenal resection ( e.g . BII-anatomy ) exclude .</detailed_description>
