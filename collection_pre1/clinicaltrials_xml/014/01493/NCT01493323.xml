Vulnerability factor SB may consider clinical term ( propensity hopelessness , aggressive impulsivity trait ) , neurobiological term ( serotoninergic system disorder , especially ventral prefrontal cortex-vPFC ) cognitive term ( decision making , cognitive function mediate vPFC serotoninergic system ) . Finally , genetic factor seem also involve suicide vulnerability . The investigator conduct preliminary study suggest increase perception psychic pain major depressive disorder increase suicidal ideation suicidal act . Study anatomic basis psychic pain trigger represent relevant theme understand suicidal process . Among classical factor trigger psychic pain suicidal act , event social exclusion appear crucial .
