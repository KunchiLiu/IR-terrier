	<brief_summary>Background : - CDB-2914 hormone block progesterone , necessary maintaining pregnancy . In woman fibroid tumor , CDB-2914 shrank tumor . In many case , menstrual period stop treatment . Because CDB-2914 decrease stop menstrual bleed woman fibroid , may able treat abnormal period woman without fibroid . Objectives : - To see whether CDB-2914 treat abnormal uterine bleeding premenopausal woman . Eligibility : - Premenopausal woman abnormal uterine bleeding cause fibroid . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test . An ultrasound fluid uterus test fibroid . Uterine cell collect biopsy . - For next three menstrual cycle , participant take either CDB-2914 placebo . Treatment study blood test symptom diary . - At end treatment , participant three option . They surgery Clinical Center another 3 month CDB-2914 . The third option stop treatment Clinical Center . - Surgery either uterine ablation hysterectomy . Only woman old age 33 may hysterectomy . Blood urine sample collect surgery . - Both surgery treatment participant followup exam . - All participant final followup exam 1 year stop treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abnormal uterine bleeding common gynecologic complaint reproductive age woman . Medical treatment abnormal uterine bleeding high failure rate surgical management remain primary , definitive therapy . Most woman undergo hysterectomy abnormal bleeding fail therapeutic trial medical management . Consequently , development efficacious , new medical treatment abnormal uterine bleed urgently need . Many reproductive age woman also need contraception . Ulipristal acetate ( UPA ) , novel progesterone receptor modulator develop NIH , promise effective medical treatment abnormal uterine bleed contraceptive agent . In woman symptomatic fibroid , UPA significantly reduce fibroid size , stop menstrual bleeding lead increase red blood cell hemoglobin . It also inhibit release egg ovary ( ovulation ) without reduce estrogen level cause hot flash , make contraception potential future use . This study evaluate UPA effect estrogen production ovulation , determine whether reduces bleed woman abnormal uterine bleeding assess Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire ( MIQ ) menstrual calendar . Women anatomic abnormality uterus eligible participate . Participants take UPA ( 10 mg daily mouth ) similar-appearing inactive pill ( placebo ) approximately 90 day . Women randomly assign receive daily UPA 10 mg , daily placebo tablet , initial three-month period . The participant investigator inform treatment group . To understand effect UPA uterus lining ( endometrium ) , woman study end UPA treatment , include ultrasound image uterus injection small amount sterile saline uterine cavity , biopsy endometrium examine tissue microscope . Before take study agent , woman record daily bleed complete MIQ monthly . During treatment period , blood take weekly measure hormone level ( evaluate ovulation blockage ) , monthly evaluate safety . At end randomize study period , research team offer participant additional option UPA surgical therapy . Women may choose surgical therapy NIH may elect treatment option elsewhere .</detailed_description>
