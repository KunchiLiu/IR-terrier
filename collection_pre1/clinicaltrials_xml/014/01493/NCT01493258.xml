	<brief_summary>In project investigator seek utilize experience develop comprehensive informatics framework rapid adaptation dissemination Comparative Effectiveness Research ( CER ) product tailor different category health consumer include difficult-to-reach patient . Based previous successful experience computer-assisted education , investigator refine current CO-ED platform implement test novel system individualize continuous patient education ( iCOPE ) . The iCOPE platform specifically design support rapid adaptation , customization , dissemination CER product difficult-to-reach population . The iCOPE platform implement universal mean customized delivery CER information format interactive self-paced educational module , quick `` question &amp; answer '' guide , interactive decision aid . In addition , iCOPE platform support innovative concept continuous patient health education provide patient easy access interactive CER update via web , MP3 player phone-based interactive voice response ( IVR ) technology . Though iCOPE design support whole spectrum CER product , project investigator focus Comparative Effectiveness Research Summary Guide ( CERSG ) entitle `` Pills Type 2 Diabetes . '' The following primary hypothesis test RCT : Use iCOPE platform associate improvement CERSG knowledge elderly 6 month intervention . The investigator also examine impact iCOPE medication adherence self-efficacy , diabetes medication satisfaction , HbA1c , CERSG acceptance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interactive , computer-based education potential greatly increase interest , learner actively participate learn process ( Fox , 2009 ) . In addition , involvement auditory , visual , interactive learning strategy increase recall information . Computer-assisted educational program may incorporate feature promote ease use , write multiple language , script level address needs low literacy learner , view often need patient ( Fox , 2009 ) . Several study report result use computer technology educate elderly patient health condition . Stromberg et al ( 2006 ) use single-session , interactive computer-based educational program chronic heart failure elderly patient . They demonstrate interactive computer-mediated education may effectively used increase patient ' knowledge , heart failure . Another study , conduct Lin et al ( 2009 ) , evaluate usability touch-screen-enabled personal education program ( PEP ) . The result show system evaluate usable useful , old adult satisfy experience . Similar finding report Neafsey et al ( 2008 ) also evaluate patient-centered computer-mediated program use touch screen computer . Authors report high satisfaction old adult user , increase knowledge self-efficacy avoid adverse self-medication behavior . Elderly patient less likely younger patient seek incidental information condition via internet . ( Tian &amp; Robinson , 2008 ) Elderly patient therefore less likely navigate internet look information evidence treatment guideline condition . More targeted effort may need reach population . Disseminating information via combination high technology medium along traditional medium easily usable helpful ( Longo , 2005 ) . A recent review barrier drivers health IT use elderly , ill , underserved , reveal technology play role offer effective intervention . The consumer perception benefit use system , convenience use , familiar technology important factor intervention success ( Jimison et al. , 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
