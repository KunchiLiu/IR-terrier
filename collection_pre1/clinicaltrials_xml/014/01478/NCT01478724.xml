	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis define systemic skeletal disease characterise low bone mass microarchitectural deterioration bone tissue , consequent increase bone fragility susceptibility fracture . Osteoporosis serious public health problem responsible approximately 3 million woman osteoporosis France , approximately 150,000 case per year occur vertebral fracture , one third would diagnose 50,000 hip fracture ( cause death 20 % case ) . The frequency disease increase age , particularly among woman : 10 % among woman age 60 year 20 % among woman age 65 40 % among woman age 75 . At menopause , oestrogen deficiency cause alteration immune system , decrease bone formation , microarchitectural deterioration decrease bone mass . Various factor may contribute decrease bone density diet , lifestyle , genetic background . According prospective study , overexpression 135 % hip fracture expect European level 50 year . Therefore , interest develop new prevention approach aim maintain healthy age population . Nutritional research consider set real prevention . Studies suggest specific milk protein fraction contain factor able promote bone formation , inhibit bone resorption vitro . In animal model , show specific fraction prevents bone loss age ovariectomised rat reduce bone resorption . Furthermore , human volunteer , supplementation specific milk protein fraction maintains balance bone remodelling increase bone mineral density . For example , healthy postmenopausal woman , report mean rate gain lumbar BMD MPF group ( 1.21 % ) significantly high placebo group ( -0.66 % ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . The objective study assess efficacy daily consumption milk proteins fraction bone mineral density improvement healthy postmenopausal woman .</brief_summary>
