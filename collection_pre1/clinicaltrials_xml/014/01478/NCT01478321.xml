	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give hypofractionated radiation therapy together temozolomide bevacizumab work treat patient high-grade glioblastoma multiforme anaplastic glioma . Specialized radiation therapy , hypofractionated radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy together temozolomide bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival ( OS ) patient recurrent high grade malignant glioma treat concurrent radiation , temozolomide , bevacizumab follow adjuvant temozolomide bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine impact regimen neurologic symptom via Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-Br ) FACT-Fatigue scale Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status . II . Determine safety profile regimen . III . Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) 6 12 month ( patient ) well 3 month ( bevacizumab-exposed patient ) . OUTLINE : CONCURRENT THERAPY : Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 day week begin day 0 . Patients also receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 2 week begin day -3 0 . Treatment continue 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ADJUVANT THERAPY : Beginning 2 week completion radiation therapy , patient receive temozolomide PO QD 6 week bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month .</detailed_description>
