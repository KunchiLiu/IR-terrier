	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Recent two-center result ( 1 ) support beneficial effect combine high-frequency oscillation ( HFO ) , recruitment maneuver ( RMs ) tracheal gas insufflation ( TGI ) survival patient severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . The addition TGI HFO improve gas-exchange ( 1-4 ) ; however , value respect outcome still remain uncertain ( 1 ) . TGI likely useful patient severe oxygenation disturbance and/or poor tolerance hypercapnia ( 2 ) . The main goal present study 1 ) The determination effect intermittent , combine use HFO RMs ( HFO-RMs - intervention group ) survival compare best possible strategy lung-protective conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV - control group ) ; 2 ) elucidation mechanism action HFO respiratory function ARDS-related inflammatory response . The consecutive hypothesis support conduct present trial summarize follow : The use HFO + RMs likely augment lung recruitment , consequent improvement oxygenation lung compliance The HFO-related , physiological benefit likely maintain subsequent CMV , adequate positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) level use ( 1 ) . Therefore , follow sequence event expect intermittent use HFO-RMs : - Lung Recruitment &amp; Compliance → - Ventilation pressure subsequent CMV ( compare pre-HFO CMV ) → - Risk ventilator-associated lung injury → - ARDS-related inflammatory response → - ARDS-related organ system failure ( ) → - Survival These hypothesis consistent precede result 125 patient ( 1 ) . The present HFO-RMs protocol simplify relative previous study , order improve generalize applicability . The use HFO-TGI optional limit 1 ) rescue oxygenation procedures HFO-RMs CMV group ; 2 ) certain patient HFO-RMs-group `` severe oxygenation disturbance '' ( see definition ) , `` poor control '' arterial pH ( pHa ) /PaCO2 ( see ) . The frequency HFO-TGI use compare 2 study group study completion . METHODS Patients The study protocol receive Institutional Review Board Approval . An Information Sheet detail potential benefit risk study participation provide next-of-kin eligible patient . Following discussion study one investigator , write , next-of-kin consent study participation request . As soon clinically feasible , patient inform study right withdraw . Study participant must fulfill eligibility criterion present dedicated section . Continuous patient monitoring include electrocardiographic lead II , inra-arterial pressure with/without cardiac index ( PICCO plus , Pulsion Medical Systems , Munich , Germany ) , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) . Anesthesia maintain continuous infusion midazolam propofol fentanyl remifentanil . Neuromuscular blockade cisatracurium use concordance standard recommendation ( 6 ) , part attend physician-prescribed medical treatment . During first 48 hour post-enrollment , patient receive continuous infusion cisatracurium ( 7 ) . Randomization Patient randomization result assignment control ( CMV ) group ( receive treatment CMV alone ) , intervention ( HFO-RMs ) group [ receive treatment extend HFO session least 96 hour ( HFO session interrupt 96-hour time point PaO2/FiO2 rise &gt; 200 mmHg &gt; 12 hour ) ] , whenever require , additional HFO session least 12-24 hour , intersperse CMV describe ) . For participate center , sequence unique random number 1 200 generate apriori Research Randomizer ( www.randomizer.org ) . To achieve concealment patient study entry , random number mark piece paper place opaque envelope , subsequently seal . Envelopes prepare department 's statistician , externally labelled patient serial number . Envelopes open follow patient serial number order obtainment sign informed consent . Thus , consecutive study entry , envelope open random number contains assign patient his/hers unique study-number . Patients even odd study-numbers allocate CMV HFO-RMs group , respectively . CMV strategy Immediately randomization , study participant receive CMV follow combination FiO2/PEEP : 0.5/10-12 cm H2O , 0.6/14-16 cm H2O , 0.7/14-16 cm H2O , 0.8/14-16 cm H2O , 0.9/16-18 cm H2O , 1.0/20-24 cmH2O . Whenever oxygenation improve , FiO2 reduce first , follow reduction PEEP accord aforementioned FiO2/PEEP combination . Whenever oxygenation deteriorate , PEEP increase first , follow increase FiO2 accord aforementioned FiO2/PEEP combination . Rationale use high PEEP : According recent meta-analysis ( 8 ) , use PEEP level comparable propose present protocol may associate improved survival . In patient body mass index &gt; 27 kg/m2 and/or urinary bladder pressure ≥15 mmHg , positivity end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure ( PLend-exp ) confirm esophageal balloon technique ( 9,10 ) , daily first 10 day post-randomization ; case negative PLend-exp , PEEP level increase PLend-exp becomes positive ( 10 ) ; rationale : obese patient patient increase intra-abdominal pressure likely require high PEEP level prevention expiratory derecruitment . Tidal volume within 5.5-7.5 mL/Kg predict body weight . The maximal plateau pressure limit 40 cmH2O , target plateau pressure ≤32 cmH2O ( 7 ) ; rationale : study Meade et al ( 11 ) , high plateau pressure tolerate allow use high PEEP level . When plateau pressure exceed 32 cmH2O &gt; 15 min , follow adjustment conduct : tidal volume reduction 4.0 mL/kg predict body weight , respiratory rate increase 35/min , PEEP reduction ≥2 cmH2O . These adjustment concurrently result achievement below-provided gas-exchange target . The respiratory rate titrate pHa 7.20-7.45 . The inspiratory-to-expiratory time ( Ι : Ε ) ratio ≤1/2 . The oxygenation target SaO2=90-95 % , and/or PaO2=60-80 mmHg . At pHa &lt; 7.20 , breathe circuit deadspace minimize connect Y piece directly tracheal tube ( 7 ) , tidal volume increase 8.0 mL/kg predict body weight , respiratory rate increase 35/min . If measure fail , criterion `` poor control pHa/PaCO2 , '' use bicarbonate infusion permit . Additional option include use TGI 6-7 L/min , extracorporeal CO2 removal . In CMV group , RMs ( Continuous positive airway pressure 45 cmH2O 40 FiO2=1.0 ) use frequency 3/day first 5 day post-randomization . RMs start 9:00 a.m. repeat every 5 hour ; mean second RM perform 2:00 p.m. , third RM 7 p.m . If RM , SaO2 drop 10 % , mean arterial pressure drop 25 % , RM immediately abort , next RM perform least 10 hour . If first daily RM abort , second RM cancel third RM administer . If second daily RM abort , third daily RM cancel . If third daily RM day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 abort , next RM conduct 9:00 a.m. subsequent day . After day 6 , protocolized use RMs ; rationale : time ARDS onset pass , probability RM-associated oxygenation improvement decrease risk RM-related hypotension increase ( 12 ) . HFO-RMs strategy In HFO-RMs group , HFO session use day 1-5 post-randomization ; rationale : NCT00637507 HFO use ≤5 day ~75 % patient intervention group ( 1 ) . The daily HFO session start 9 a.m. last minimum 12 hour . The HFO-RMs strategy described . Recently publish recommendation regard HFO use ( Sensormedics 3100B ventilator , Sensormedics , Yorba Linda , CA , USA ) include follow step ( 13 ) . 1 . Sufficient level sedation abolishment respiratory muscle activity , without neuromuscular blockade ; latter mandatory first 48 hour ( 7 ) . 2 . Confirmation endotracheal tube patency placement tube 3-4 cm carina . 3 . RMs : Immediately patient-oscillator connection , RM perform ( increase circuit pressure 45-50 cmH2O 40 oscillator 's piston ) . During day 1-5 post-randomization , RMs repeat every 5-6 hour . RM abort criterion CMV group . In HFO-RMs group , RMs use solely HFO . 4 . FiO2 initially set 1.0 , adjust accord protocol ( see ) . 5 . Bias flow set 60 L/min ; rationale : maximal bias flow set expect result improve CO2 clearance HFO breathing circuit . 6 . Initial oscillation frequency 4 Hz , titrate pHa &gt; 7.20 . The minimum value oscillation frequency 3.5 Hz ; rationale : HFO experience suggest use frequency &lt; 3.5 Hz associate increase risk high-frequency ventilator malfunction . 7 . Oscillatory pressure amplitude ( ΔP ) initially set 90 cmH2O titrate accord pHa &gt; 7.20 ( range=60-100 cm H2O ) . 8 . A tracheal tube cuff leak place facilitate CO2 elimination . The associated reduction mean airway pressure ( mPaw ) 4-5 cmH2O immediately reverse use correspond control knob . Cuff pressure maintain ≥20 cmH2O . 9 . If pHa &lt; 7.20 , despite oscillation frequency 3.5 Hz maximal ΔP set 100 cmH2O , deadspace breathe circuit minimize connect Y piece directly tracheal tube ( 7 ) . If pHa still remain &lt; 7.20 , criterion `` poor control pHa/PaCO2 '' fulfil , use bicarbonate infusion permit . As CMV ( see ) , additional option include use TGI 6-7 L/min , extracorporeal CO2 removal . 10 . The I : E ratio maintain 1:2 . 11. mPaw adjustment follow : Α ] Initial mPaw=mPaw CMV + 10-13 ( maximal allowable=45 ) cm H2O , Β ] Within next 2 hour : mPaw titration ±3 cm H2O determine `` optimal mPaw set '' achieves high PaO2 FiO2=1.0 , C ] Reduction mPaw rate 1-2 cmH2O/6 hour , downward titration precede RM . 12 . Patients return CMV maximum 96 hour HFO initiation , provide PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 200 mmHg achieve &gt; 6 hour . Return CMV 96 hour HFO initiation allow whenever PaO2/FiO2 rise &gt; 200 mmHg achieve maintain &gt; 12 hour HFO . Within day 5-10 , patient return HFO whenever PaO2/FiO2 fall 200 mmHg &gt; 12 hour ; criterion re-return CMV PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 200 mmHg &gt; 12 hour end day 10 , provide time point PaO2/FiO2 exceed 100 mmHg ; subsequent use HFO accord below-presented protocol `` Rescue Oxygenation . '' 13 . TGI 6-7 L/min permit option patient fulfills follow criterion `` severe oxygenation disturbance '' : During pre-HFO CMV , patient require FiO2 0.9-1.0 ( PEEP level ≥16 cmH2O ) maintain SaO2 90-95 % ( and/or PaO2 60-80 mmHg ) ; virtually equivalent patient PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 100 mmHg PEEP level ≥16 cmH2O . In case , rest above-described , protocolized adjustment intervention HFO-RMs protocol use without additional change ; rationale : TGI may useful patient , require maximal support CMV maintain clinically acceptable level oxygenation ( 3 ) . Rescue Oxygenation Patients group eligible rescue oxygenation fulfill follow criterion : Patient CMV FiO2 1.0 PEEP level ≥20 cmH2O , sustain life-threatening hypoxemia ( i.e. , PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg &gt; 30 min ) , associate `` promptly reversible '' factor ( e.g . pneumothorax , malpositioning obstruction tracheal tube , ventilator malfunction ) . Rescue oxygenation technique may include use HFO-RMs and/or HFO-TGI , prone position ( 14 ) , inhale nitric oxide ( Nitric Oxide - ΝΟ ) , intravenous almitrine , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . The use one rescue oxygenation technique last least achievement reversal life-threatening hypoxemia 1 hour . Patient follow-up Baseline patient data record within 2 hour pre-randomization . Daily recording include physiologic/laboratory data ( day 1-28 post-randomization ) , intervention-associated complication ( day 1-10 ; example : RM-induced hypotension desaturation ) , mechanical ventilation-associated barotrauma [ study-independent radiologist assess chest radiograph pathologic gas collection ( ) , e.g . pneumothorax ] , data organ/system failure medication ( day 1-60 ) , episodes failure maintain unassisted breathe various complication ( hospital-discharge death ; example : infection , heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ) . During day 1-10 , set physiologic measurement obtain follow : 1 ) CMV group : 3 measurements/day , start 8:30 a.m. 2 ) HFO-RMs group : , , 6 hour HFO , CMV group day 5 . Measurements include arterial/central-venous blood-gas analysis , hemodynamics , respiratory mechanic CMV ( include respiratory compliance ) ; also , morning one day 1-10 , determine record fluid balance precede 24 hour . For between-group comparison , use CMV-data obtain within 8:30-9 a.m. group . Daily fluid balance also compare 2 group . Lastly , patient receive HFO-TGI day 1-5 , brief fiberoptic inspection trachea conduct morning day 6 detect potential , TGI-associated tracheal mucosal damage . Bronchoscopic finding define follow : Grade I : Pink glisten tracheal mucosa ; Grade II : Reddened and/or swollen mucosa with/without presence purulent secretion ; Grade IIIA : Hemorrhagic mucosa and/or presence thrombotic material ; Grade IIIB : Limited localized necrosis , especially carina , and/or presence necrotic mucosal slough ; Grade IIIC : Extensive localized necrosis , especially carina , and/or presence necrotic mucosal slough . Grade IIIA-IIIC finding consider suggestive TGI-related mucosal damage . A bleeding diathesis ( present ) consider independent risk factor Grade IIIA finding . Findings suggestive TGI-related tracheal mucosal damage patient result use HFO-TGI rescue oxygenation particular patient . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) BAL ≤100 mL perform day 1 6 post-randomization patient group . Patients eligible BAL PaO2/FiO2 maintain &gt; 100 mmHg &gt; 12 hour intubate orotracheal tube internal diameter ≥8.5 mm , tracheostomy tube . An ( additional ) RM perform fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedure . BAL fluid sample use microbiological culture , cell count , determination concentration phospholipid , surfactant-related protein , inflammatory marker . The purpose aforementioned investigational intervention elucidation effect HFO function surfactant ARDS-related inflammation ( 15-18 ) . During bronchoscopic procedure , blood sample also obtain determination concentration inflammatory marker peripheral blood . BAL fluid study The initial , 20-mL portion BAL fluid aspirate send microbiological culture , rest store ice-cold tube . Subsequently , BAL fluid filter sterile gauze centrifuge 500 g 15 min 4 0C . The supernatant use determination concentration inflammatory marker , phospholipid , surfactant-related protein . The sediment use total cell count , determination cell type , estimation cell viability Neubauer plate . Both supernatant sediment store -700C . Surfactant aggregate , surfactant-related protein , inflammatory marker The cell-free supernatant 500 g centrifugation subject additional consecutive centrifugation 30,000 g και 100,000 g 90 min 4 0C . This do separate surfactant aggregate accord size . The Large Surfactant Aggregates ( LSAs ) obtain 30,000 g centrifugation sediment . LSAs consider major determinant alveolar surface tension . The less active Small Surfactant Aggregates Very Small Surfactant Aggregates respectively obtain sediment supernatant 100,000 g centrifugation ( 15 ) . Surfactant study include total lipid concentration , separation lipid class thin layer chromatography , determination lipid phosphorus content ( 15 ) , surfactant-related protein ( 17 ) . In addition , supernatant analyze determine concentration tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha , interleukin ( IL ) 1-beta , IL-1 receptor antagonist , IL-6 , IL-8 , transform growth factor alpha ( 16,18 ) , activin alpha , folistatin , whereas inflammatory marker determine peripheral blood . POTENTIAL RISKS OF INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR PREVENTION Potential risk : Barotrauma . Preventive measure : This potential risk equally high CMV HFO ( 19,20 ) . Prevention include rapid HFO-RMs-related improvement oxygenation lung compliance , consequent reduction ventilation pressure subsequent CMV . Regarding theoretical risk bronchoscopy-related barotrauma , bronchoscopies perform experienced operator , intra-procedural ventilation ( comprise tidal volume 2-3 mL/kg predict body weight rate 35/min PEEP temporarily reduce 0-5 cmH2O ) also manage experienced physician . Potential risk : Hypotension-drop cardiac output . Preventive measure : This potential risk equally high CMV HFO ( 19,20 ) . If RM-associated , RMs abort ≥10 hour ( hold also case RM-induced desaturation - see ) . TGI-related complication : Such complication expect , short-term use TGI ( 1-4 ) . Nevertheless , TGI may cause tracheal mucosal damage , inspissation secretion , pneumothorax , gas embolism , hemodynamic compromise ( 1-4 ) . In NCT00637507 , 1 61 patient intervention group ( 1.6 % ) may suffer reversible tracheal mucosal injury ( 1 ) . This patient receive TGI total 118.3 hour period 10 day ( 240 hour ) ; prolong full recovery severe ARDS currently lead normal life .</detailed_description>
