	<brief_title>A Study Combining mFOLFOX6 With Tivozanib Bevacizumab Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer First Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging scan ( compute tomography [ CT ] /magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) ass disease progression complete within 28 day prior first study drug administration , approximately every 8 week first 18 month approximately every 12 week patient show progressive disease ( PD ) per investigator , withdraw consent , lose follow-up died . Per original protocol , patient contact study site every 12 week survival follow end-of-treatment visit death 3 year end-of-treatment visit . The interim futility analysis conduct December 2013 , base pre-specified analysis cutoff date 13 September 2013 . The study bring close specify protocol due result interim futility analysis participant derive benefit ( per treat physician ) current treatment remain study one discontinuation criterion meet . Given early closure study , update additional efficacy analysis perform interim analysis . A biomarker analysis conduct January 2014 , base data cutoff date 13 September 2013 . The safety analysis update new cutoff date 28 February 2014 .</detailed_description>
