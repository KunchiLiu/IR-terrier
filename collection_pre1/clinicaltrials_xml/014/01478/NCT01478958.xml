	<brief_summary>It well establish diet play important role development progression heart disease . Different type dietary fat vary effect heart disease risk factor . The elasticity individual 's blood vessel strongly associate heart disease risk recent evidence suggest dietary manipulation may influence elasticity blood vessel dietary fat ( include saturate , monounsaturated polyunsaturated fatty acid ) potentially important modulator . Substantial evidence exists effect monounsaturated fat ( type fatty acid mainly find olive rapeseed oil ) , n-6 polyunsaturated fat ( type polyunsaturated fatty acid find vegetable oil ) saturate fat ( find mainly animal derive product ) lipid level . However , influence dietary fat elasticity blood vessel remain unclear.The main purpose DIVAS study determine effect substitution saturate fat either n-6 polyunsaturated monounsaturated fat blood vessel elasticity determine effect different dietary fat risk factor heart disease include lipoprotein inflammatory biomarkers .</brief_summary>
