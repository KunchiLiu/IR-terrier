	<brief_title>Exercise-induced Improvements Inflammatory Status Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic , systemic inflammatory disorder may affect many tissue organ , principally attack synovial joint . Although cause rheumatoid arthritis unknown , autoimmunity play role chronicity progression , RA consider systemic autoimmune disease . Due chronic inflammatory status , RA-patients high risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) compare general population . Accumulating evidence indicate regular physical activity beneficial effect RA . The mechanism behind exercise-induce improvement none less unclear research need well understand beneficial effect exercise train patient group . Recently , promise result gene expression study blood cell reveal unexplored field biomarker discovery gene expression profile disease . Due easy accessible minimally invasive sample collection , gene expression profile whole blood might turn promising tool molecular diagnostics clinical medicine . To knowledge , whole-genome transcriptional change previously study RA-patients undergo high-intensity exercise program . Hypothesis : Ten week high intensity interval train improves inflammatory status , quality life , know risk factor cardiovascular disease . In addition measure traditionally inflammatory marker blood , whole genome analysis make .</detailed_description>
