	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy ( RT ) integral component management brain tumor , cognitive deficit follow cranial irradiation well document . There association damage neural progenitor cell ( NPC ) neurocognitive dysfunction . NPC similarly know play important role recovery damage brain , include radiation-induced damage . However NPC extremely sensitive radiation . In spite information , current RT planning technique limit radiation dose NPC containing region . Recent human study demonstrate possible use intensity modulate radiation therapy reduce radiation dose NPC contain region RT brain tumor , without compromise coverage tumor . We hypothesize NPC-sparing RT reduce neurocognitive decline follow treatment brain tumor , without compromise tumor local control . However , conflict data regard role NPC development glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Some study suggest GBM derive NPC whereas others associate NPC improved tumor control follow therapy GBM . Prior evaluation neurocognitive outcome NPC-sparing RT , therefore imperative evaluate whether NPC-sparing RT technique lead increase LR spar NPC contain niche brain . The propose study design evaluate LR spar region brain follow NPC spar RT patient newly diagnose GBM . Our research consist 3 specific aim : 1 ) Determine LR rate 1 year spar NPC contain niche patient treat NPC spar RT GBM ; 2 ) Quantify extent radiation dose spar NPC contain region possible without compromise tumor coverage patient GBM ; 3 ) Determine feasible evaluate cognitive function prospectively patient undergo NPC spar RT GBM . The long term goal research establish whether NPC spar RT technique improve neurocognitive outcome compare conventional RT brain tumor . If propose study demonstrate NPC spar RT associate increase LR spar region brain compare conventional RT , ideally serve foundation future multi-institutional randomize control trial compare neurocognitive outcome patient treat NPC-sparing RT versus conventional radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
