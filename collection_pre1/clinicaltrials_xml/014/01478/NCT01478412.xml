	<brief_summary>This trial determine prostate target delineation obtain ultrasound base system equivalent accuracy MRI image fusion , alignment correction vector obtain ultrasound imaging equivalent accuracy orthogonal X-ray image daily prostate positioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation Polymer Based Fiducials Use Imaging Patients Receiving Treatment Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator also assess follow : 1 . Whether polymer-based marker adequately visualize daily stereoscopic imaging compare gold seed marker . 2 . Whether polymer-based marker visible ultrasound imaging . 3 . To determine polymer-based marker produce few artifact treatment plan CT scan gold marker .</detailed_description>
