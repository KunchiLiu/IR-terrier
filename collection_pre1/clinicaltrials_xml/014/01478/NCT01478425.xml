Study design : Randomized , control , double-blind , parallel , multicentre multinational clinical trial , show superiority active therapy compare control therapy . Study disease : Intermittent persistent Allergic Rhinitis . Data drugs/interventions study : This clinical investigation study Class 1 medical device product . This prospective study active medical device versus control medical device . Study population total number subject : It consider feasible recruit 10 patient patient per center , therefore study conduct 10 center . To get treatment balance within center , total 100 patient recruit . In order participate study , eligible candidate must fulfill follow inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion : Inclusion criterion 1 . Patients either gender , age 18 year old . 2 . With previous diagnostic allergic rhinitis rhinoconjunctivitis due sensitization birch , grass olive tree pollen . Patients sensitize inhaled allergen might include provided sensitization relevant patient 's clinical symptom expose allergen . 3 . Having suffer allergic rhinitis symptom ( severe enough require symptomatic medication usually prescribe condition ) previous year , otherwise free symptom inclusion . 4 . Residing month March July 2011 geographical area exposure birch , grass olive tree pollen relevant ( average pollination peak 100 grains/m3 air previous specific pollen season ) . 5 . Providing write informed consent participate study . Exclusion criteria 1 . Known asthma origin ( intrinsic extrinsic , latter due kind allergenic trigger ) . 2 . Allergic rhinitis rhinoconjunctivitis whose symptom exclusively due sensitization inhale allergen different refer inclusion criterion , sensitization pollen may interfere patient 's allergic status study period ( e.g. , plane tree pollen ) . 3 . Rhinitis rhinoconjunctivitis allergic characteristic present spring season negative allergy study ( skin prick test ( SPT ) ) . 4 . Asymptomatic sensitization birch , grass olive tree pollen . 5 . Sensitization birch , grass olive tree pollen , mild symptom spring 2010 , require use symptomatic medication . 6 . Sensitization birch , grass olive tree pollen present asthma symptom . 7 . Concurrent participation another clinical trial time study . 8 . Co-morbid condition , investigator 's judgment , preclude participate study . 9 . Continuous treatment antihistamine , corticosteroid , immunosuppressant drug may alter occurrence and/or severity allergic symptom . 10 . Individuals , even meet inclusion criterion , concurrently treatment allergen-specific immunotherapy receive treatment within last 36 month .</detailed_description>
