	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Breathing Retraining Heart Failure Patients : Health-Behavior Related Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In heart failure ( HF ) patient , dyspnea key contributor strong predictor hospital readmission . In addition , dyspnea fatigue primary reason decrease physical activity ( PA ) , turn , lead activity avoidance , subsequent muscle de-conditioning , increase dyspnea even low level activity . Depression , moderate relationship dyspnea , diminish PA increase disability activity daily live ( ADLs ) . Strategies minimize mitigate dyspnea boost motivation imperative improve adherence PA , , turn , improve fatigue , muscle strength , PA , functional status , disability ADLs include basic ADLs instrumental ADLs ( IADLs ) , depression , quality life ( QOL ) HF patient . The overall purpose pilot/feasibility study evaluate 8-week , home-based DBR intervention , HF patient experience dyspnea rest daily activity . Using experimental randomize controlled design , 50 participant 19 year age , diagnose chronic HF , experience dyspnea rest activity experience dyspnea limit activity , telephone , reside rural area , recruit University Nebraska Medical Center HF clinic Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Hospital , Cardiology-Congestive Heart Failure clinic . Both group receive usual care HF specialist . The experimental group receive information Diaphragmatic Breathing Retraining ( DBR ) intervention whereas health promotion ( attention control ) group receive general health information . To boost adherence intervention prevent attrition study , group receive telephone call research nurse total 4 session ( week 1 , 2 , 4 6 ) . During follow-ups via phone call attention control group , research personnel discuss health promotion topic ( e.g. , lipid profile , health eating , cancer screening , annual check-ups ( e.g. , flu shot , eye and/or dental exam ) primary health care provider . Data collection use standardized measure , take place baseline , post-intervention , 3-month follow-up completion 8-week intervention . The primary outcome : dyspnea fatigue . The secondary outcome : muscle strength , PA , functional status , depression , disability ADLs , quality life .</detailed_description>
