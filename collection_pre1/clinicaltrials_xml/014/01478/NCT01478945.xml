	<brief_summary>This study small pilot randomise control trial ( RCT ) compare hand-held NB-UVB light device placebo device . These device use participant treat vitiligo home period four month . The main purpose trial provide feasibility data use inform design future multi-centre RCT device . Two hand-held UVB device similar manual operating system test pilot study . This trial help investigator establish device likely best main trial . Participants approach variety way ( secondary care , primary care direct advertising ) . Potential participant contact co-ordinating centre express interest trial give information trial , check preliminary eligibility , send appointment screen visit close recruiting hospital ( Nottingham Leicester ) . This screen visit conduct research nurse , dermatologist also present order confirm diagnosis vitiligo confirm participant 's suitability UVB treatment home . If eligible willing take part trial , participant provide write informed consent baseline data collect . In order define start dose use treat vitiligo , minimum erythema dose ( MED ) test conduct . An educational session provide research nurse outline use device , assess side-effects treatment complete treatment diary . It anticipate screen visit educational session take place day may take 1.5 hour . On follow day , brief visit hospital require order examine skin read MED result ( convenient , educational session may deliver time ) . Once do , participant give device use home - treatment apply 3 time per week alternate day . They follow telephone week 1 , week 2 week 12 - order provide support monitor side-effects . Participants ask keep treatment diary record treatment use record side-effects experience . Emergency contact detail provide case urgent medical need . Participants continue treatment home 16-week trial period . Two hospital visit take place order record outcome data</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HI-Light Pilot Trial Vitiligo : Hand Held NB-UVB Early Focal Vitiligo Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study pilot trial determine feasibility conduct subsequent large multi-centre RCT . The objective pilot trial : Primarily : 1 . To establish proportion eligible participant willingness randomise home NB-UVB Secondarily : 2 . To establish participant ' adherence satisfaction use home phototherapy 3 . To assess success blind participant outcome assessor use identical placebo unit visible light fluorescence bulb instead NB-UVB bulb . 4 . To establish possible short term side effect i.e . device suitable home use limit medical supervision 5 . To manualise treatment intervention , i.e . prepare package educate participant use intervention deal possible side effect . 6 . To define test primary secondary outcome measure method data collection main RCT Trial Configuration : Parallel groups-Three arm study 1 . Group A : active hand hold NB-UVB unit ( Dermfix 1000 ) 2 . Group B : active hand hold NB-UVB unit ( Waldmann ) 3 . Group C : placebo hand hold NB-UVB unit ( placebo Dermfix 1000 ) The allocation active placebo group 2:1 . This trial configuration reflect participant ' allocation active placebo group main RCT ( 75 % participant receive active treatment ) , latter likely three arm factorial trial . Subsequently , result obtain pilot trial regard participant ' willingness randomise precise estimate main RCT . Setting : Participants primarily indentified secondary care ( Nottingham , Leicester , Derby Mansfield ) direct advertising . Recruitment extend include primary care time resource allow . Sample size estimate : This pilot study , sample size resource driven term available subject reasonable time frame , formal statistically base sample size estimate applicable . For pilot study , 21 participant ( 7 group ) allow investigator measure recruitment rate site ; n=21 also give reasonable estimate acceptability completeness outcome data . Number participant : The investigator estimate recruit 21 participant , 7 group ; however recruitment depend time resource available . Description intervention : The hand hold NB-UVB unit portable light weight NB-UVB device slightly large usual hairbrush . These unit CE mark use within license authorisation . The hand hold device hold small area skin ( 10-12cm x 6.5-4 cm ) spacers provide order standardise distance skin . Hand hold NB-UVB unit suitable small lesion make phototherapy available participant limited disease , participant find difficult attend hospital-based phototherapy unit 2 3 time week . The lamp hold still vitiliginous lesion . If size lesion big mention i.e . 10-12 cm X 6.5-4 cm , participant ( parent legal guardian young participant ) ask move lamp slowly area circular movement . In trial investigator explore 2 similar hand hold NB-UVB ( 311nm ) phototherapy device output , slighly different size treatment window , weight device cable length . By investigator able monitor assess 2 unit best tolerate term participant ' satisfaction minimisation side effect . The information gather assist choice device main RCT . Device A : Dermfix 1000 NB-UVB Device B : Waldmann UV 109 Both device manual unit on/off switch external digital timer . The user device follow write treatment protocol , set re-set timer time manually keep accurate diary exposure time . The device need connect socket time . Placebo Device : Placebo Dermfix 1000 , Device A The placebo device use identical active device Dermfix difference emit 311nm NB-UVB . Duration study : The recruitment plan commence soon approval ( ethic R &amp; D ) place take approximately 6 month . Each participant participate study 4 month . Participants assess face face visit begin screen stage-baseline , 8th week 16th week . Outcomes assessed time point . Follow telephone call make week 1 , 2 12 . Randomisation blinding : Participants blind device receive , ( intervention group A B control group C ) . The research nurse blind group participant allocate ( intervention groupS A B control group C ) . The randomisation base computer generate pseudo-random code use random permute block randomly vary size , create Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit ( CTU ) accordance standard operate procedure ( SOP ) hold secure server . The randomisation stratify 3 group ( Group A , B C ) 2 recruit site . Statistical method : Demographic , baseline data measure compliance summarise descriptive statistic ( number [ n ] , mean , standard deviation [ SD ] , median , minimum maximum ) frequency table , stratify treatment . Also , calculation re-pigmentation rate , spread &amp; cessation vitiligo lesion conduct 3 device . This information vital sample size calculation definitive trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants diagnosis vitiligo confirm dermatologist . Participants focal disease , le 25 % body surface area . Age : child adult ( upper age limit ) . The child old 5 year old and/or mature enough understand eye must keep close , stay still duration treatment . No therapy vitiligo previous 2 week vitiligo treatment trial per trial protocol . Participants spread stable disease Participants able give inform consent . We aim treat vitiligo lesion , however participant ( parent/legal guardian participant child ) research nurse agree begin trial lesion participant would want treat , non expose site area difficult reach treat , e.g . back . Segmental vitiligo Universal vitiligo Previous history skin cancer Recent concurrent radiotherapy Photosensitivity Use immunosuppressive photosensitive drug Pregnant lactate woman Any major medical comorbidities Vitiligo lesion genitalia treat</criteria>
