	<brief_summary>Background : Patients genetic disorder neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system . These include plexiform neurofibroma . The conventional treatment internal plexiform neurofibroma surgery . This surgery possible single limited tumor . On hand tumor often surgically intractable due multiplicity infiltrate characteristic Increased activity mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) protein see neurofibromas . mTOR inhibitor rapamycin , derivative everolimus may slow stop tumor growth patient NF1 . Objectives : Primary objective To determine whether everolimus effect volume surgically intractable life-threatening internal plexiform neurofibroma patient neurofibromatosis 1 . Secondary objective To determine whether everolimus effect number volume cutaneous neurofibroma ; determine whether everolimus modify signal pathway cutaneous neurofibroma . Eligibility : - Adults neurofibromatosis type 1 least one internal plexiform neurofibroma , life-threatening causing significant morbidity compression organ . This internal plexiform neurofibroma ( ) intractable surgery . Design : An open-label , single arm , non-randomized , single stage phase IIa study . Baseline phase : Baseline evaluation perform within 2 week , maximum 4 week specific exam , first dose study drug . Treatment phase/duration treatment : All patient treat RAD001 10 mg p.o daily dose one year except case unacceptable toxicity , death , discontinuation study reason . Follow-up phase : All patient two follow-up visit schedule 18 24 month first dose study drug follow adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) may occur discontinuation study internal plexiform neurofibromas assessment . Radiological review : All Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRIs ) obtain baseline , treatment period follow-up period review Neuroradiologist study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) autosomal dominant disease affect 1 3000 1 4000 people . NF1 characterize multiple dermal neurofibroma , plexiform neurofibroma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) , optic pathway glioma , well café-au-lait spot abnormality skeletal , cardiovascular central nervous system . The NF1 gene locate chromosome 17q11.2 , protein , neurofibromin , function tumor suppressor . People NF1 decrease life expectancy 15 year , MPNST lead cause death young adult . A specific phenotype risk mortality identify , patient subcutaneous neurofibroma . Individuals subcutaneous neurofibromas 3 time likely internal plexiform neurofibroma others . Individuals internal plexiform neurofibromas 18 time likely develop MPNST patient without internal plexiform neurofibroma . Beside MPNST , internal plexiform neurofibromas life-threatening cause significant morbidity compression organs mainly spine nerve root . The conventional treatment internal plexiform neurofibroma surgery . This surgery possible single limited tumor . On hand tumor often surgically intractable due multiplicity infiltrate characteristic . In context medical treatment decrease size tumor would place short term aim low consequence compression long-term aim reduce risk malignant transformation . NF1 consequence loss-of-function mutation NF1 tumor suppressor gene . The NF1-encoded protein , neurofibromin , function Ras-GTPase activate protein ( RasGAP ) . Accordingly , deregulation Ras think contribute NF1 development . The mTOR pathway tightly regulate neurofibromin . mTOR constitutively activate NF1-deficient primary cell human tumor absence growth factor . This aberrant activation depend Ras PI3 kinase , mediate phosphorylation inactivation TSC2-encoded protein tuberin AKT . Importantly , tumor cell line derive NF1 patient , genetically engineer cell system require Nf1-deficiency transformation , highly sensitive mTOR inhibitor rapamycin . Furthermore , activation endogenous Ras lead constitutive mTOR signal disease state , normal cell Ras differentially require mTOR signal response various growth factor . Thus , NF1 tumor suppressor indispensable regulator TSC2 mTOR . Ras play critical role activation mTOR normal tumorigenic setting . mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potently suppress growth aggressive NF1-associated malignancy genetically engineer murine model . In tumor rapamycin function via mechanism generally assume mediate tumor suppression , include inhibition HIF-1 alpha indirect suppression AKT , suppress mTOR target Cyclin D1 . The mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 ( Everolimus ) decrease growth 19 % 60 % 4 day treatment NF1 MPNST cell line . Finally , data suggest rapamycin , derivative everolimus may represent viable therapy NF1 . This proof concept do tuberous sclerosis rapamycin efficient treat angiomyolipomas11 . The management neurofibromatoses France coordinate Pr . Pierre WOLKENSTEIN French National Referral Centre Neurofibromatoses network , NF-France . The cohort follow centre network constitute 3000 patient among 80 100 life-threatening internal plexiform neurofibroma . Therefore investigator propose trial evaluate efficacy everolimus surgically intractable life-threatening internal neurofibroma neurofibromatosis 1 base data literature cohort .</detailed_description>
