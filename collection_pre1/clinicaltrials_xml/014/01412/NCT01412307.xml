	<brief_summary>Management patient recur Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) stem cell transplantation failure represent typical unmet medical need prompt active development validation new agent treatment strategy . The LEBEN protocol combine two agent , lenalidomide bendamustine , frame different target tumor microenvironmental cell HL . These agent , show low risk overlap extrahematologic toxicity , may hit proliferation machinery H-RS cell and/or progenitor , synergistically inhibit tumor-related angiogenesis interfere cytokine-mediate circuitry operate microenvironment support tumor cell survival . A weekly schedule bendamustine , 60 mg/m2 , combine continuous administration increase dose lenalidomide ( 10 , 15 , 20 e 25 mg dose level 28-day cycle ) . Such schedule Bendamustine aim enhance antiangiogenic immunomodulatory activity continuous Lenalidomide , study show low protracted dos alkylators induce decrease microvascular density tumor tissue inhibit mobilization viability circulate endothelial progenitor . The Bayesian phase 1/2 dose find method Thall Cook employ . This method choose dose based-on response toxicity , account trade-off two outcome .</brief_summary>
