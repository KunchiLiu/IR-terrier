	<brief_summary>Today variety diagnostic tool detect allergenic agent available skin test , provocation test blood test . Due high sensitivity low cost skin prick test commonly use test identify allergies patient . By use kind skin test , 25 different agent test parallel , render skin prick test cheap , easy-to-handle rapid diagnostic tool . However , research proceeds , new tool appear intention make future application even convenient -for , patient physician . For purpose development call `` Easyprick '' Allergen Test System way , consist foil carry ready-to-use , allergen-soaked sponge easily apply skin pricking . Allergen extract complex mixture proteins contain vary amount allergenic non-allergenic component . In order control variability achieve consistency reproducibility optimal safety sensitivity/specificity , essential standardize amount allergen use prick test . The present study aim standardize eight allergen extract use method . Standardized extract apply Easyprick Allergen Test System evaluate compare conventional prick test second study . - Trial medicinal product</brief_summary>
