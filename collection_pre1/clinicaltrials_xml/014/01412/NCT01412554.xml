	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify risk factor insulin resistance investigate influence insulin sensitivity development cardiovascular risk marker like blood pressure , heart rate , body build ( weight , BMI , waist-hip ratio , skinfold thickness ) , reduce insulin sensitivity , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia , sympathoadrenal activity manifest cardiovascular disease among young men 10-20 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 1988 Reaven describe syndrome design `` syndrome X '' base cluster resistance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake , hyperinsulinaemia , hyperglycaemia , increase triglyceride , decrease high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol high blood pressure propose insulin resistance common feature aetiology syndrome . Later obesity sympathetic nervous system propose pathogenic factor metabolic syndrome , still major controversy exist regard precise aetiology different definition metabolic syndrome also discuss . Insulin resistance grow epidemic concern industrialize develop country . It one components metabolic syndrome , play important role pathogenesis type 2 diabetes . In view predict increase number diabetic patient come decade , information risk factor pathophysiology diabetes utmost importance early detection possible prevention early treatment medical financial perspective . Our research group decade study pathophysiology insulin resistance , hypertension , sympathoadrenal hyperreactivity dyslipidaemia . We also recently finish long-term follow study subject base cardiovascular sympathetic response mental stress . During 1991-2002 healthy young men recruit military enlistment Oslo/Akershus area examine Center Cardiovascular Renal Research , Division Medicine , Oslo University Hospital , Ullev√•l . Young , healthy men , mean age 21 , examine use hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic glucose clamp technique , gold standard ass insulin sensitivity . The present study aim re-examine subject order investigate influence insulin sensitivity development cardiovascular risk factor diabetes . We therefore unique opportunity perform true , long-term follow-up study homogenous sample subject race gender may provide new insight various pathophysiological mechanism diabetes cardiovascular disease include elucidate connection insulin resistance , change parameter body build , blood pressure sympathetic over-activity . Clarifying mechanism direct importance entire population . There knowledge previous long-term follow-up subject base insulin resistance measure gold standard technique . We want re-examine subject investigate influence insulin sensitivity development cardiovascular risk factor like blood pressure , heart rate , body build ( weight , BMI , waist-hip ration , skinfold thickness ) , reduce insulin sensitivity , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia , sympathoadrenal activity manifest cardiovascular disease among young men 10-20 year follow-up .</detailed_description>
