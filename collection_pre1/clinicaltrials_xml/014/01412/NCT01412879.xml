	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy also work different way kill cancer cell stop grow . It yet know whether rituximab effective combination chemotherapy bendamustine hydrochloride treat patient mantle cell lymphoma undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give rituximab together combination chemotherapy bendamustine hydrochloride follow consolidation chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell transplantation work treat old patient previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1106 Rituximab With Combination Chemotherapy Bendamustine Hydrochloride Followed Consolidation Chemotherapy Stem Cell Transplantation Older Patients With Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To estimate 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient newly diagnose mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) treat rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , dexamethasone ( RHCVAD ) , methotrexate cytarabine ( MTX/Ara-C ) , autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) rituximab bendamustine ( R-bendamustine ) autologous stem cell transplant select regimen development . - To assess response rate overall survival patient newly diagnose MCL treat R-HCVAD/MTX/Ara-C ASCT R-bendamustine ASCT . - To assess toxicity tolerability R-HCVAD/MTX/Ara-C ASCT R-bendamustine ASCT patient newly diagnose MCL . - To determine prognostic value quantitative minimal-residual disease ( MRD ) monitor peripheral blood MCL patient induction therapy serially high-dose chemotherapy ASCT treatment outcome . - To bank diagnostic tissue section future translational research study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk classification Mantle Cell Lymphoma International prognostic Index ( MIPI ) score ( low risk v intermediate/high risk ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( induction therapy ) : - Courses 1 3 : Patients receive induction therapy comprise rituximab IV day 1 ; cyclophosphamide IV 3 hour every 12 hour day 2-4 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 72 hour day 5-7 ; vincristine sulfate IV day 5 12 ; dexamethasone IV orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2-5 12-15 . Patients responsive disease course 1 proceed course 2 . - Course 2 4 : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 ; methotrexate IV 2-22 hour day 2 ; cytarabine IV 2 hour every 12 hour day 3-4 ; leucovorin calcium PO IV day 3-6 . Patients undergo stem cell collection completion course 2 . - Each course 21 day long continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( induction therapy ) : - Course 1-6 : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-4 week later , patient responsive disease receive 2 additional course treatment . - Stem cell mobilization : Beginning within 8 week , patient receive rituximab IV cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients undergo stem cell collection 26 day later . Consolidation therapy : Patients receive one follow preparative regimen . - BCV* chemotherapy : Carmustine IV 2 hour day -6 -4 ; etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 ; cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -2 . - BEAM* chemotherapy : Carmustine IV 4 hour day -7 -6 ; etoposide IV 1 hour twice daily cytarabine IV 2 hour twice daily day -5 -2 , melphalan IV day -1 . - TBI , etoposide , cyclophosphamide : Patients undergo total-body irradiation ( TBI ) ** twice daily day -8 -5 . Patients also receive etoposide IV day -4 cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -2 . - NOTE : * Patients 61 year age older receive either BCV BEAM . - NOTE : * *TBI may use patient 61 year age old . Stem cell transplantation : Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 8 year registration .</detailed_description>
