	<brief_summary>Prospective cohort study aim simplify diagnostic approach symptomatic patient clinical suspicion deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) low extremity . All patient receive pre-test clinical probability ( PTP ) determination D-dimer . Patients low PTP negative D-dimer diagnosis rule . All patient undergo compression ultrasonography ( CUS ) proximal vein system . Patients negative CUS either low PTP negative D-dimer diagnosis rule , high PTP positive D-dimer undergo extensive ultrasound investigation calf vein system . All patient diagnosis DVT rule followed-up prospectively three month document development symptomatic thromboembolic event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All eligible patient undergo D-dimer measurement formal assessment pre-test clinical probability ( PTP ) mean Wells score . Patients unlikely PTP negative D-dimer DVT rule undergo 3-month clinical follow-up . If least one two test positive , patient undergo CUS proximal vein system investigate least common femoral vein groin , superficial femoral vein mid thigh popliteal vein ( ) popliteal fossa . A positive CUS adjudicate proximal DVT . In case negative CUS proximal vein system , patient either negative D-dimer unlikely PTP DVT rule , undergo 3-month follow . Only patient concomitant likely PTP positive D-dimer undergo whole-leg ultrasonography interrogation calf vein . A positive test adjudicate distal DVT . Patients negative test undergo 3-month clinical follow . Follow-up . All patient DVT rule monitor 3 month ( either clinical visit telephone contact ) enrolment study . Patients clinical symptom DVT PE follow-up undergo objective diagnostic testing ( venous ultrasound suspect DVT spiral CT-scan VQ scan suspect PE ) . All source document send independent adjudication . In case death , PE diagnosis adjudicate mean autopsy , available . If autopsy available , adjudication PE-related death do base clinical documentation . D-dimer . All quantitative D-dimer test available center acceptable purpose study . D-dimer consider negative accord cut-offs provide manufacturer . Sample size . The investigator expect every 100 symptomatic outpatient DVT exclude without need objective test approximately 30 % , approximately 20 % CUS-detected proximal DVT , approximately 15 % negative CUS unlikely PTP spite positive D-Dimer ( need investigation ) , approximately 15 % negative CUS negative D-Dimer spite likely PTP ( need investigation , approximately 20 % negative CUS likely PTP positive D-Dimer ( thus require interrogation calf vein system ) . The investigator hypothesize incidence venous thromboembolic event follow patient label DVT exceed 1 % application propose algorithm , upper limit 95 % confidence interval around proportion exceed 2 % . Accordingly , ap proximately 1100 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
