	<detailed_description>Objective : To test validity accuracy grade referral system diabetic retinopathy conduct trained screener use digital camera , mobile medical unit centralize image-storing software underserved , ethnically diverse neighborhood community health center Methods Research Design : Retinal screening exam use telemedicine technology offer 8 community health center 1229 individual , age 16-80 year diabetes throughout San Diego County 18 month . Images electronically capture , transfer EyePACs1 image software read independently trained technician retinal specialist . Statistical analysis conduct evaluate prevalence disease accuracy validity reading . Snellen eye test glaucoma test use tonometry also conduct . Results : Will evaluate demographic include age , gender , ethnicity , duration diabetes , type diabetes need dilation . Severity disease capture . Statistical analysis conduct technician accuracy grade reading . Conclusions : To demonstrate telemedicine retinal screening utilize mobile medical unit trained technician high-risk , ethnically diverse population accurately detect positive negative screen . This may model increase access retinal examination order meet ADA HEDIS guideline allow efficient use retinal specialist evaluate treat disease lead cost efficient method care .</detailed_description>
