	<detailed_description>Transition exclusive breast feeding complementary feeding pose many challenge demand nutrient necessary optimum growth development increase steadily . Malnutrition micronutrient malnutrition inter-generational affect pregnant mother consequently baby may bear deficient micronutrient store , especially iron . This deficiency exacerbate sub-optimal practice breast feeding . Globally , iron deficiency common cause anemia estimate affect nearly 2 billion people especially preschool child . In Pakistan , 56 % child age five year estimate iron deficiency anemia 13 % also severely malnourish . These deficiency affect physical growth also mental development significant impact immunity increase burden infection . It uncertain appropriate intervention strategy wide range option mention include dietary diversification nutrition education , provision fortify food , iron supplementation home-based fortification complementary food micronutrient powder Sprinkles . In effort understand prevalence nutrition develop effective intervention improve growth micronutrient status infant receive complementary food , I undertake prospective community-based randomize control efficacy trial representative urban population Karachi . Infants mother identify birth enrol study receive one intervention community health worker age six month . The enrolled infant place three group - define Nutr Education ( Nutr Edu ) , Oral iron supplementation ( OIS ) Multiple micronutrient fortification ( MMF ) . Nutrition education component common group . Through nutritional education session hold community , dietary diversification along continuation breast feeding stress enhance intake diet , rich iron , micronutrient . A cohort 451 infant ( 177 group Nutr Edu , 141 group OIS 133 MMF ) follow three month ( till end treatment ) growth , micronutrient status , morbidity rate thereafter follow another three month evaluate anthropometric parameter .</detailed_description>
