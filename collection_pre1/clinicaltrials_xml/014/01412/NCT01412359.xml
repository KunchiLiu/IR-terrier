	<brief_summary>The overall purpose study determine replace standard soybean oil base fat emulsion Omegaven® , fish oil base fat emulsion , reverse prevent progression parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis . It compassionate use protocol patient already significant cholestasis relate parenteral nutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Omegaven® Treatment Parenteral Nutrition Associated Hepatic Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , patient dependent upon parenteral nutrition ( PN ) receive parenteral fat emulsion compose soybean oil . Lipids necessary PN dependent patient due high caloric value essential fatty acid content . Phytosterols contain soybean oil base fat emulsion think deleterious effect biliary secretion implicate predispose patient PN associate liver disease . Children require prolonged course PN risk develop PN associate liver disease . The investigator hypothesize although soybean oil base fat emulsion prevent fatty acid deficiency , clear manner similar enteral chylomicron therefore accumulate liver result steatotic liver injury . Animal study show fish oil base IV fat emulsion ( IFE ) high eicosapentaenic docosahexaenoic acid , reduce impairment bile flow see cholestasis cause conventional fat emulsion . Omegaven® fish oil base IV fat emulsion . The investigator hypothesize administer Omegaven® place conventional soybean fat emulsion may reverse prevent progression PN associate cholestasis thus allow patient maintain adequate PN he/she able ingest adequate nutrition enterally .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 2 month 10 year age . Patients PN dependent ( unable meet nutritional need solely enteral nutrition ) expect require PN least another 30 day Patients consider eligible study participation must parenteral nutrition associate liver disease ( PNALD ) define direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dL . Other cause liver disease exclude . A liver biopsy necessary treatment . 2 consecutive direct bilirubin test result &gt; 2.0mg/dL The patient must fail standard therapy prevent progression liver disease surgical treatment , cyclic TPN , avoid overfeeding , reduction/removal copper manganese TPN , advancement enteral feeding , use ursodiol ( Actigall ) . Subjects currently treatment PNALD Compassionate Use Omegaven direct Bilirubin &lt; 2 , remain TPN dependent require continue therapy Omegaven . Other known cause chronic liver disease ( hepatitis C , cystic fibrosis , biliary atresia alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency ) Enrollment clinical trial involve investigational agent ( unless approve designated physician multidisciplinary team ) The parent , guardian , child unwilling provide consent assent Allergy fish product , egg protein , and/or previous allergy Omegaven Active coagulopathies characterize ongoing bleed requirement clot factor replacement fresh frozen plasma cryoprecipitate maintain homeostasis Impaired lipid metabolism severe hyperlipidemia without pancreatitis Unstable diabetes mellitus Stroke/embolism Collapse shock Undefined coma status Active infection time initiation Omegaven® time child afebrile stable vital sign one negative 48 hour culture .</criteria>
