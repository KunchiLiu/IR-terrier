Liver transplantation available life save treatment patient end stage liver disease . Unfortunately less 100 liver transplantation perform Saudi Arabia three center . Around 100 patient travel abroad transplantation annually patient progressively deteriorate eventually die complication decompensated liver cirrhosis . In addition , even patient list liver transplantation , often patient sick wait transplant list often take year on-list mortality high .
