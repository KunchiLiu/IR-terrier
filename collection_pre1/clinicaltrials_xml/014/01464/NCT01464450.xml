	<brief_summary>The primary objective study learn relative bioavailability ( extent drug become available body ) pharmacokinetics ( blood level ) rivaroxaban healthy participant receive 20 mg rivaroxaban tablet orally whole tablet , crush mixed applesauce , suspension Naso-gastric ( NG ) tube . The relative bioavailability rivaroxaban may different give crush tablet compare intact ( whole ) tablet give via NG tube . The safety tolerability rivaroxaban also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Study Oral Rivaroxaban Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label ( people know identity drug ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , 3-period , 3-treatment cross study relative bioavailability ( extent drug become available body ) single dose rivaroxaban give healthy participant 3 way . All participant randomly assign follow 1 6 possible ordered sequence whereby ultimately receive rivaroxaban : whole tablet orally ( Treatment A ) , crush tablet mixed applesauce orally ( Treatment B ) , crush tablet water suspension administer via NG tube ( Treatment C ) . Each rivaroxaban treatment take food ( standardized liquid meal ) . Participants randomly assign one follow 6 sequence : - Sequence 1 : Treatment A - Treatment B - Treatment C - Sequence 2 : Treatment A - Treatment C - Treatment B - Sequence 3 : Treatment B - Treatment C - Treatment A - Sequence 4 : Treatment B - Treatment A - Treatment C - Sequence 5 : Treatment C - Treatment A - Treatment B - Sequence 6 : Treatment C - Treatment B - Treatment A . It expect total 9 participant randomly assign sequence . Each single-dose treatment period follow washout period ( period receive treatment ) sufficient length ensure absence drug carry one treatment period next . The study enroll approximately 54 participant achieve 42 complete participant . The study consist screen phase ( long 21 day enter clinical research facility day start study drug ) , randomly assign 1 6 sequence , open-label treatment phase consist 3 treatment period ( 4 day treatment ) separate washout period 6-14 day rivaroxaban administration treatment period . Participants admit study unit morning day give first dose study drug ( Day -1 ) . Study drug give morning first day treatment period ( Day 1 ) , follow standard Osmolite® 1.5 Cal ( Abbott Laboratories ) liquid meal . Participants receive study drug morning Osmolite® 1.5 Cal give breakfast meal . Osmolite® 1.5 Cal standardize source balance nutrition patient require low-residue meal via feed tube orally and/or may limited volume tolerance fluid restriction . An Osmolite® 1.5 Cal meal include 1.5 calories/mL overall , 62.7 g protein/L . Participants regular meal 3 hour Osmolite® 1.5 Cal meal . Each treatment period follow 6 14 day washout period . The washout period start give study drug .</detailed_description>
