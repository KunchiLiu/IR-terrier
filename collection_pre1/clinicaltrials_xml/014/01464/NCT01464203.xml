	<brief_summary>Heart disease remain common cause death UK . Chest pain often first present symptom patient heart disease , may warn signal prior heart attack death . The diagnosis base symptom alone however unreliable test almost always necessary . Rapid access chest pain clinic ( RACPCs ) able expedite assessment patient . The principal investigation use exercise stress electrocardiogram ( s-ECG ) . Although simple , cheap , convenient , s-ECG often inaccurate ; miss diagnosis falsely suggest diagnosis . This happen many 25 % patient , result delay treatment unnecessary investigation . CT Angiography ( CTA ) novel non-invasive technique coronary artery visualise Computerised Tomography . In previous study show high degree correlation invasive angiography , high accuracy diagnosis obstructive coronary artery disease . However , technique relatively new , full role yet define clinical set chest pain clinic . The investigator present information whether able speed diagnosis , reduce need test , therefore also cost . In trial , investigator aim examine accuracy cost effectiveness CTA patient suspect cardiac chest pain present chest pain clinic , compare establish technique like s-ECG , myocardial perfusion scan coronary angiography . The study enable u establish optimal cost effective strategy investigation patient present chest pain clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : - To assess diagnostic accuracy cost effectiveness non-invasive coronary angiogram Cardiac CT diagnosis coronary artery disease patient angina , set Rapid Access Chest Pain clinic - To formulate optimal diagnostic algorithm term accuracy cost effectiveness diagnosis CAD patient chest pain . Study Setting : - Rapid Access Chest Pain clinic 3 NHS hospital ( Barnet , Chase Farm Royal Free hospital ) Target Population : - Patients new onset , stable exertional angina present Rapid Access Chest Pain clinic . Study Design Methodology : This trial design prospective randomize case - control study . 600 patient meet study criterion recruit Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinics . The patient randomize 2 cohort ( study control ) 300 . All patient undergo stress - ECG refer hospital . Patients control group receive 'standard clinical care ' . Their management alter inclusion trial . All patient study group undergo CT coronary Angiography Clinical Imaging Research Centre base Wellington Hospital . Patients obstructive coronary artery disease ( define &gt; 50 % stenosis leave main coronary artery &gt; 70 % stenosis one major epicardial coronary artery ) refer invasive coronary angiography +/- revascularization . Patients intermediate ( 50-70 % ) coronary stenosis refer myocardial perfusion scan ( MPS ) . Patients significant reversible ischemia MPS refer invasive coronary angiography +/- revascularization . Patients evidence significant reversible ischemia MPS &lt; 50 % stenosis CT coronary angiogram discharge appropriate medication . All patient follow 12 month recruitment . Information gather regard clinical event ( non-fatal/fatal MI , acute coronary syndrome , hospitalization , emergency/elective revascularization ) quality life per SF-36 questionnaire . All diagnostic therapeutic procedure underwent patient cohort record . The cost-effectiveness CT coronary angiography calculate use NHS reference cost . Primary outcome measure : The total cost diagnosis current diagnostic strategy use Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinics new strategy involve use CT coronary angiography investigation patient angina . Secondary outcome measure : - Diagnostic Accuracy CT coronary angiography - Prognostic value CT coronary angiography - Number normal angiogram cohort - Number angiograms follow revascularization cohort - Quality life assess SF-36 Questionnaire For calculate cost effectiveness , NHS reference cost use . Thus , cost benefit consider NHS perspective</detailed_description>
