	<brief_summary>Weaning mechanical ventilation ( MV ) essential part management patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) critically ill . The best strategy use establish . Objective : To compare Spontaneous Breathing Trial ( SBT ) Pressure Support Ventilation SBT `` T '' tube wean MV patient COPD . Design : Randomized Clinical Trial . Methods : This study include patient COPD , admit Intensive Care Unit Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição , undergo MV least 48 hour . When consider care team ready SBT , randomize one follow strategy : SBT Pressure Support SBT `` T '' Tube . The primary endpoint study reduction day spend MV . Other outcome measure mortality , extubation success rate , time wean MV , length ICU stay incidence tracheostomy .</brief_summary>
