	<detailed_description>Obesity associate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) steatohepatitis ( NASH ) recently , low-grade inflammation hypothesize causative link . From animal study , know compound resveratrol ( RES ) strong anti-inflammatory antioxidant effect perhaps potential neutralize obesity-induced disease . RES already widely use food supplement though precise effect unknown . This project focus effect RES fatty liver disease . In double-blind control clinical trial , researcher investigate effect RES 500 mg placebo treatment x 3 daily 6 month NAFLD/NASH 48 obese patient double-blind , randomise , control clinical trial . The researcher hypothesize RES improve ALT level reduce liver fat inflammation assess MR spectroscopy histological evaluation .</detailed_description>
