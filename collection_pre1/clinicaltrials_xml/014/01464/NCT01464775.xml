	<detailed_description>Introduction : Endometriosis relatively common chronic gynecological condition affect approximately 10 % woman reproductive age . It pelvic inflammatory disease characterize presence endometrial gland stroma outside uterine cavity . Typical symptom endometriosis include dysmenorrhea , pelvic pain , infertility ; severity pain associated disease often lead considerable decrease quality life . The standard treatment severe pelvic pain infertility surgically remove endometriotic area . Identifying endometriotic lesion paramount `` optimal endometriosis debulking . '' The inability see endometriosis lesion think factor patient little relief follow surgery . Using Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) method potential improve visualization endometriosis lesion , assist debulking thus , result improve clinical outcome . NBI technique use specific narrow wavelength light change normal color contrast endoscopic image improve detection neovascularization , pathological feature endometriosis superficial deep vascularization . This type image potential offer improve discrimination lesion , increase diagnostic yield well result complete debulking . The result pilot study 21 patient conduct Mercy Medical Center demonstrate use NBI result diagnosis pathologically-proven endometriosis among 4 patient whose lesion miss visible white light examination . In addition , number confirm endometriosis lesion increase use NBI addition white light . The study also suggest NBI may assist discriminate endometriosis lesion , thus reduce false positive : one patient lesion detect NBI lesion biopsied base visible white light examination endometriosis pathologic examination . Lesion discrimination white light examination base lesion color previously describe literature . Red ( also know clear and/or pink ) lesion consider active early lesion endometriosis . White lesion may indicate area fibrosis may latent dormant lesion endometriosis . The red white lesion also know `` subtle '' lesion endometriosis . Black ( also know brown , chocolate green , purple blue ) represent severe stage disease . Black lesion also know `` gunshot '' `` powder-burn '' lesion consider `` typical '' lesion endometriosis . Mixed color lesion include mixture color . It speculate subtle lesion endometriosis likely positive lesion miss white light examination . The red lesion also consider vessel small diameter may also include peritoneal microlesions therefore may easily detect NBI . The investigator conduct multi-center study follow primary aim determine degree NBI improve detection diagnosis endometriosis lesion . 1 . Determine degree NBI improve diagnosis endometriosis ( diagnostic yield ) laparoscopic examination compare use visible white light-only laparoscopy . 2 . Determine NBI improve sensitivity detection potential endometriosis lesion reduce false positive compare visible white light . Secondary aim : Determine impact use NBI , presume complete removal endometriotic lesion , compare use white light examination report severity pain 6-weeks , 3-months , 6 month follow surgery . The result study would significantly advance state art diagnosis treatment endometriosis . Improved detection treatment endometrial lesion translate significant health benefit woman suffer endometriosis . Potential health benefit include improve diagnosis etiology pelvic pain , therefore guide appropriate treatment management woman pelvic pain due endometriosis improve debulking lesion . The propose study design multisite randomize control device trial conduct two clinical center . Women randomize laparoscopic examination white light follow NBI ( white light/NBI ) examination white light follow repeat white light examination ( white light/white light ) . Women reproductive age ( &lt; 50 year age ) undergo diagnostic laparoscopy pelvic pain , suspect endometriosis , infertility eligible . A systematic examination cover four quadrant pelvis conduct use white light follow either NBI white light identify document endometriotic lesion . Study Aims Hypotheses : The use NBI addition white light examination improve diagnostic yield endometriotic lesion time laparoscopy compare use white light examination . The use NBI addition white light examination improve sensitivity detect endometriotic lesion reduce false positive laparoscopy compare use white light examination . Secondarily , use NBI associate great reduction pain 6-week , 3-month , 6-month follow-up compare use white light examination alone improve lesion identification debulking . Pass/Fail Criteria Primary Aims . In randomized clinical trial , failure define statistically significant difference primary outcome diagnostic yield sensitivity white examination arm white light follow NBI examination arm . Study Design Methods The investigator test hypothesis conduct multicenter device trial . Participants randomize either white light/NBI white light/white light 3:1 ratio . In study group , quadrant pelvis first examine white light . Once full exam perform use white light lesion location document photograph , randomization envelope open reveal patient 's second modality ( NBI white light ) . Each area inspect second modality photograph take quadrant , document lesion location . All identified lesion area amenable resection resect , label method detection , send pathologic examination . Study Outcomes : The primary outcome comparison diagnostic yield , sensitivity , false positive rate visible white light ( white light/white light ) versus NBI ( white light/NBI ) base pathology gold standard . Methods : Investigator Training : The investigator train visualization endometriosis NBI - Viewing WL NBI image potential endometrial lesion various type - The procedural use NBI - Completion study form ensure data integrity The participate surgeon assistant site train procedural use NBI Olympus coordinate center . A minimum three case patient suspect positive endometriosis watch surgeon coordinator remain site . The training surgeon perform sweep quadrant pelvis . Each area view white light . The training surgeon ask surgeon identify suspicious area would biopsy . Then train surgeon switch NBI ask train surgeon identify suspicious area would biopsy . This do ensure participate surgeon able identify suspicious area image modality learn potential endometrial lesion look like NBI . Olympus visit site prior first procedure train assistant ( ) completion study case report form . Olympus also monitor adherence protocol completion first study case report form time study start ( first patient enrollment ) ensure surgeon perform procedure accord protocol assistant accurately capture require information . Study Population : The population include woman reproductive age undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy suspect endometriosis . The study population may include : - Patients undergoing initial diagnostic laparoscopy pelvic pain , suspect endometriosis infertility - Patients previously evaluate laparoscopy undergo repeat laparoscopy suspect recurrence onset endometriosis Recruitment : Women recruit gynecologic practice participate physician . At pre-surgery visit , patient inform purpose study well risk benefit procedure ask sign inform consent . After sign informed consent , woman ask complete baseline questionnaire obtain information demographic characteristic , medication history , symptom . A 10-centimeter ( cm ) visual analog scale validate endometriosis symptom questionnaire [ Endometriosis Health Profile-30 ( EHP-30 ) ] also administer assess pain . The EHP-30 instrument specifically design measure pain quality life among woman diagnose endometriosis . The EHP-30 consist core questionnaire 30 item five scale six modular part consist 23 question . The EHP-30 demonstrate high reliability validity . Equipment : - OLYMPUS HD EndoEYE Video Telescope ( Models WA50011A , WA50013A , WA50013L , WA50013T , WA50015L ) OLYMPUS HD EndoEYE Laparo-Thoraco Videoscope LTF-VHOLYMPUS CLV-180 EVIS EXERA II Xenon Light Source OLYMPUS CV-180 EVIS EXERA II Video System Center OLYMPUS HD LCD Surgical Monitor - SONY HD recorder PDW-70MD - Printers OEP-4 Examination Procedures : The laparoscopic examination conduct standardized fashion visible white light ( standard ) , follow additional sweep either white light ( control ) NBI . The second look examination determine random assignment completion first examination white light . The examination include visualize quadrant pelvis ( Right Anterior , Right Posterior , Left Posterior , Left Anterior ) . Each area first view photographed white light . The absence presence suspect endometrial lesion note . If suspect lesion see , number lesion , extent lesion surgeon 's confidence lesion endometriosis record . Photographs label quadrant lesion circle numbered . Clinicians record degree confidence 5 point likert scale lesion excise lesion endometriosis . Following visualization , photographic identification documentation quadrant white light complete , study coordinator open randomization envelope reveal second modality use . The physician repeat exam photograph either white light ( control ) NBI ( switch NBI ) . Again , second modality , absence presence suspect endometrial lesion note . If suspect lesion see , number lesion , extent lesion , lesion color surgeon 's confidence lesion endometriosis record . A photograph take , labeled lesion circle numbered . Clinicians record degree confidence 5 point likert scale lesion excise lesion endometriosis . The surgeon record lesion also visualize 1st image modality one modality . The order area examine sweep surgeon 's discretion . Examination sweep photograph . Photos area detect lesion print , label lesion circle numbered . All suspect endometrial lesion include analysis , even lesion may latent heal ( otherwise know white lesion ) . Once exams complete , additional area abdomen evaluate surgeon 's discretion ; randomize white light continue white light examination . All lesion detect either method amenable resection number biopsied . Data collect include location , method detection clinical diagnosis confidence score . Pathologists mask method detection ( NBI versus white light ) . Lesions record accord fall within three category : visible white light-detected ; NBI-detected ; NBI- visible white light-detected . Pathology perform center follow standardize protocol diagnosis endometriosis . Pathologists institution mask method examination use identify specimen . All discordant lesion ( visualized one image modality ) , random 10 % sample specimens random 10 % image center re-reviewed central independent reviewer coordinate center . Lesions amendable resection photograph include data analysis . Data Collection : 1 . Patient baseline questionnaire : symptom , medication history , demographic information , pain measurement ( include 10-cm visual analog scale EHP-30 ) 2 . Photo documentation light examination 3 . Case report form : - Recording location lesion method examination - Notation lesion color - Clinical impression detect lesion - degree confidence scale 1 5 lesion observe endometriosis - Notation lesion excise - Photographic documentation lesion - Change surgical treatment ( large excision/smaller excision/organ removal ) base result visualization different image modality . 4 . Pathology report 5 . Medical record review 6 . Provider questionnaire : plan follow-up treatment surgery 7 . Follow-up questionnaire pain 6-weeks , 3-months 6-months ; follow-up survey include 10-cm visual analog scale EHP-30 Quality Control : Quality control maintain standardize protocol across center . As state , patient , location lesion suspect endometriosis detect modality document photograph . All discordant lesion ( see one image modality ) random 10 % sample image specimen sample center re-reviewed central independent reviewer coordinate center . The result site physician central reviewer compare . If site central reviewer disagreement photograph lesion pathology , adjudication perform site central reviewer . If consensus still reach , third party ( surgeon and/or pathologist ( remain site ) use tie breaker . Randomization Procedure Subjects assign one two group stratify randomized design . All subject undergo white light examination follow either second examination white light examination use NBI . Investigators blind second look image method initial white light examination complete . Randomization either white light/NBI white light/white light occur 3:1 ratio . Each site treat independent subject combine across site analysis . A randomization table generate use Microsoft Excel begin study recruitment . The randomization number three digit number form last 3 digit study ID . Sealed envelope provide site coordinate center open initial white light examination . Sample size Sample size original protocol study calculate described section 12.1 . Because data third site multicenter trial ( Atlanta Northside ) use , total sample size goal ( N = 170 ) original protocol reach . Mercy approve IRB September 2012 enroll 100 patient total ; Chicago site approve enroll 57 patient . Thus , total sample size goal revise 157 ; minimal detectable difference condition 90 % power describe section 12.2 . Sample size calculation original protocol , date 5/14/2010 Sample size calculation base primary outcome diagnostic yield sensitivity well secondary outcome impact pain symptom . The sample size largely driven primary outcome diagnostic yield . A sample size 170 provide 90 % power detect improvement diagnostic yield 20 % ( 95 % CIs 72 % -85 % white light 95 % -100 % NBI ) , base randomization scheme 3:1 white light/NBI versus white light/white light examination . This sample size take consideration 25 % drop out/not evaluable rate follow reason : incomplete visualization pelvis , loss follow-up pain assessment patient evaluable pain assessment ( subset infertility patient may pain present symptom ) . This sample size provide 90 % power detect average increase one additional endometriosis lesion NBI examination ( white light/NBI group ) compare white light examination ( white light/white light group ) . To note , power calculation base data pilot study show average 2 lesion ( per patient ) find use white light 3 lesion ( per patient ) detect use NBI ; calculation assume common standard deviation 1 . Data use sample size calculation : Diagnostic yield : The calculation sample size base information obtain pilot study examine patient use white light follow NBI diagnostic laparoscopy . In study , 4 additional patient diagnose endometriosis addition NBI white light examination absolute improvement 27 % ( 4/15 patient endometriosis find NBI examination ) ( Barrueto Audlin , 2008 ) . Using data , sample size calculation conduct use nQuery 6.01 ( Elashoff , 2005 ) two group chi-square test unequal Ns ( 3:1 ratio ) . A two group chi-square test 0.05 two-sided significance level 90 % power detect difference Group 1 ( white light/white light ) diagnostic yield 0.79 Group 2 ( white light/NBI ) diagnostic yield 0.99 sample size group 34 101 , respectively ( total sample size 135 ) . Sensitivity false positive rate : In pilot study , 15 20 patient examine diagnosed endometriosis histology . All 15 patient detected NBI white light . Four patient diagnosed lesion detect NBI . Based data , estimate sensitivity white light NBI 73 % 100 % respectively . Given sensitivity small total sample size , 95 % confidence interval wide ( 48 % -90 % white light 80 % -100 % NBI ) . At lesion level , pilot data show average 2 lesion see white light compare average 3 lesion use NBI . Using common standard deviation 1 , current sample size least 90 % power detect average difference least one additional lesion . Pain difference : The study also consider pain reduction clinically relevant outcome . A recently publish study Abbott et al ( 2003 ) report participant undergo laparoscopy potential endometriosis average rat non-menstrual pelvic pain prior surgery 6 10-point visual analogue scale , 10 bad pain . In Abbott et al ( 2003 ) similar study , laparoscopic surgery use white light show associated 30 % reduction pain 6 month follow 50 % -75 % 12 month follow increase variance ( Abbott et al. , 2004 , Jarrell et al. , 2005 ) . An RCT Jarrell et al . ( 2005 ) show reduction pain score 1.9 ( SD 0.5 ) 6 month follow 2.6 ( SD 0.5 ) 12 month follow , although sample size study small ( N=16 overall , N=7 laparoscopy arm ) . This study test hypothesis NBI result additional 20 % decrease pain compare observe previously publish study examine reduction pain use white light laparoscopy . Using unbalanced randomization design 1 patient randomize white light/white light every 3 patient randomized white light/NBI , two group t-test 0.050 two-sided significance level 90 % power detect difference pain change Group 1 ( white light/white light ) mean change 1.9 Group 2 ( white light/NBI ) mean 2.28 , difference mean 0.38 common SD 0.5 , sample size two group 25 75 , respectively ( total sample size 100 ) . We project majority patient enrol ( 70 % ) symptomatic pelvic pain despite indication surgery ( i.e . pelvic pain infertility ) . Only 1 2 study center sit significant population woman undergo laparoscopy evaluation treatment infertility . Amended sample size The sample size study adjust downward 157 due loss one study center accrual . The revised sample size considers outcomes diagnostic yield sensitivity clinical determination identify lesion time surgery , modality . A review first 69 patient enrol assigned combined white light/NBI arm show average detection rate lesion 4.2 per patient use NBI versus 2.9 per patient white light . The minimal detectable difference diagnostic yield sensitivity determine use nQuery 6.01 ( Elashoff , 2005 ) . With current project sample size 157 patient , minimal detectable difference two modality , 90 % power , diagnostic yield proportion sensitivity estimate 12.2 % . Thus , power study remain sufficient detect clinically meaningful difference detection endometriosis white light NBI . Data Analysis The investigator hypothesize NBI improve detection endometriosis lesion thus improve diagnosis endometriosis . For primary outcome diagnostic yield , reference standard pathologic confirmation excise lesion one lesion within individual detect either method confirm diagnosis endometriosis . The investigator address detection endometriosis compare diagnostic yield white light/white light group versus white light/NBI group . The investigator use McNemar 's test proportion comparison , account pair assessment within participant make assumption distribution sample . At lesion level , investigator assess average change number lesion detect white light/white light group white light/NBI group use independent sample t-test . The investigator also calculate compare sensitivity false positive rate white light/white light group white light/NBI group . Pain across study period assess comparing average change pain score ( use VAS EHP-30 score ) two group . The difference average pain change score assess use independent sample t-test . Differences average pain baseline follow-up assess use pair t-tests . Data Management A copy consent form send Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) . Report form send fax electronically ( secured/encrypted ) DCC data entry . The data check consistency use select double entry 1/10th enter data re-entered checked error . Data cleaning procedure do use SAS extensive program file ensure correctness skip pattern response . After baseline information collect enter , analysis do confirm comparable baseline characteristic across two group . Confidentiality : Hard copy questionnaire interview record lock file cabinet limit keyed access research personnel . Computer data file also keep Mercy Medical Center Intranet password protect file accessible research staff . Any result study publish use data group whole . No individual identify report . Risks/Benefits Assessment Risks/Discomforts : White light examination current standard care . NBI incur additional risk . However , use NBI may result identification additional lesion thus incur risk additional resection time laparoscopy . Additional sit identify biopsy use NBI additional risk removal compare white light . Lesions identify associate high risk structure bowel diaphragm remove . Benefits : It uncertain extent participant may benefit clinically clearly state consent form . If diagnosis endometriosis improve , patient may benefit improved medical management . If additional lesion identify resect , patient may benefit improved clinical outcome . Withdrawal protocol All participant inform take part study completely voluntary right participate . If want join study , wish withdraw study , still receive quality medical care . Modifications Protocol Any modification protocol sent IRB approval . Protocol Deviations The IRB ( review board require study ) notify protocol deviation . Reporting Serious Adverse Events Unanticipated Problems The protocol minimal additional risk beyond usual risk associate diagnostic laparoscopy . Should unanticipated problem develop , investigator attend to/address problem notify institutional IRBs sponsor .</detailed_description>
