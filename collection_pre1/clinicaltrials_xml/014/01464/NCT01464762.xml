	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide early access TMC207 patient pulmonary infection due strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) resistance isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampin ( RMP ) , fluoroquinolone ( FQ ) and/or injectable second line tuberculosis ( TB ) drug ( kanamycin , amikacin , capreomycin ) unable/ineligible participate TMC207 study . In addition , information safety tolerability TMC207 combination anti-TB drug assess result microbiology assessment recommend perform early access study collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Access TMC207 Patients With Extensively Drug Resistant Pre-XDR Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC207 investigate treatment TB . TB contagious bacterial infection cause M. tuberculosis commonly affect lung , also affect organ . Treatment TB protract burdensome complicated emergence multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis strain . TMC207 diarylquinoline investigational compound offer novel mechanism anti-TB action specifically inhibit mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -synthase . Multi-drug resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) define infection strain M. tuberculosis resistant INH RMP ( also know rifampicin ) , two important drug use treat drug susceptible TB . Extensively drug-resistant TB ( XDR-TB ) define MDR-TB additional resistance important second-line TB drug , ie , one injectables ( kanamycin , amikacin , capreomycin ) fluoroquinolones . Pre-XDR TB define MDR-TB additional resistance either FQ injectable ( kanamycin , amikacin , capreomycin ) , FQ injectable . Patients either XDR-TB pre-XDR include early access study . Patients qualify study provide 24-week regimen TMC207 administer along background regimen ( BR ) . BR drug provide site investigator designate study personnel accordance national TB program ( NTP ) guideline . The BR construct least 3 anti-tuberculosis drug patient 's infection know susceptible recent drug susceptibility test ( DST ) result ( within previous 6 month ) likely susceptible , base know treatment history . The selection BR , include number companion drug TMC207 , responsibility investigator . At screen visit , complete inclusion/exclusion checklist list send sponsor representative together patient 's recent smear culture DST result ( within precede 6 month ) laboratory safety result confirm eligibility . At baseline , chest X-ray ( CXR ) take case CXR result image lung available within previous month . Once treatment initiated , patient instruct follow visit schedule base routine clinical care . Recommended visit assessment plan 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 week follow initiation TMC207 combination BR 4 week ( Week 28 ) every 24 week ( Weeks 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 ) completion TMC207 intake 96-week follow-up period . If need , extra visit assessment plan discretion investigator order best manage patient 's TB treatment . Patients take clofazimine TMC207 require electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitor mandatory protocol-specified visit . Serum chemistry ( electrolyte ) assessment perform every visit ECG perform . After last intake TMC207 , patient continue take BR supervision treat physician local health center/hospital accordance NTP guideline local multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) TB treatment practice ( i.e. , treatment may extend reason complicate lung disease , etc. ) . Patients follow 96 week ( 2 year ) last dose TMC207 evaluate microbiological effect ( verification microbiological status [ measure locally per local standard care ; eg , smear , culture , DST ] recommend perform every 24 week ) TMC207 provide patient , well monitor safety tolerability TMC207 . Patients withdraw early , unless due withdrawal informed consent , follow survival/clinical outcome ( approximately every 6 month ) early access study come end patient ' corresponding country . Patients enter study TMC207 commercially available patient 's country access another source discontinuation development program TMC207 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed pulmonary XDR preXDRTB infection resistance INH , RMP , FQ and/or injectable second line TB drug ( kanamycin , amikacin , capreomycin ) . Confirmation include previous ( within precede 6 month ) smear culture drug susceptibility test ( DST ) result demonstrate pulmonary TB XDR preXDR resistance pattern Patient limit treatment option unable/ineligible participate TMC207 study Patient manage medical center certify Green Light Committee World Health Organization ( WHO ) Stop TB Partnership , OR , follow assessment site confirms site meet equivalent standard . Patients must able receive least 3 antiTB drug patient 's infection know susceptible recent DST result ( within previous 6 month ) likely susceptible , base know treatment history , per availability country Patient medically stable opinion investigator basis physical examination , safety examination perform screen Patients must sign informed consent document indicate understand purpose procedure require study willing participate early access study History and/or clinically relevant , currently active underlie gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , nervous system , psychiatric , metabolic , renal , respiratory ( due TB ) , inflammatory , neoplastic , skin , immunological infectious disease , stable control . If clinically relevant , currently active underlying disease , compromise safety patient ability participate study judge investigator . The investigator encourage discus concomitant illnesses sponsor Patients complicate severe extrapulmonary manifestation TB , include osteoarticular central nervous system infection Patients receive TMC207 previous study Any condition , opinion investigator , would compromise early access study wellbeing patient prevent patient meeting perform protocol requirement Current alcohol , barbiturate , amphetamine , recreational narcotic drug use , investigator 's opinion would compromise patient 's safety and/or compliance protocol procedures Patients clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormality screen Patients receive medication ( within last 7 day prior Day 1 ) potential prolong QT interval</criteria>
