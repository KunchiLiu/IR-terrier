	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Thermodox Adjuvant Therapy With Thermal Ablation ( RFA ) Treatment Metastatic Colorectal Cancer ( mCRC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase II trial evaluate safety , feasibility , efficacy ThermoDox combination wtih thermal ablation regional hepatic treatment mCRC liver lesion . Eligible colorectal cancer patient unresectable liver metastasis candidate either radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) microwave ablation ( MWA ) . All unresectable lesion must target ablation 2 thermal ablation/ThermoDox procedure . Approximately 24 hour prior treatment ThermoDox , patient start regimen prophylaxis ( detailed Study Drug section ) immediate hypersensitivity reaction . Treatment begin 50 mg/m2 ThermoDox infusion administer intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute . Thermal Ablation initiate minimum 15 minute start infusion complete later 3 hour start infusion . Subjects follow visit Day 14 month 1 , 4 , 7 , 10,13 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 ( + 7 day ) study discontinuation . At baseline post-treatment clinic visit , patient self-report `` quality life '' ( QoL ) use 8-item FACT-Hepatobiliary Symptom Index ( FHSI-8 ) . Contrast CT image study Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) use assess effectiveness therapy . CT MRI scan obtain baseline month 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 ( + 7 day ) local recurrence see , subject discontinue , 2 year follow-up elapse , whichever occur first . All protocol-specified CT/MRI image centrally read independent radiology assessor . Subjects follow efficacy endpoint local tumor control 2 year treatment . Secondary endpoint include Overall Survival , Time Local Recurrence , PRO deterioration ) evaluate event occurs , subject discontinue , 3 year follow treatment .</detailed_description>
