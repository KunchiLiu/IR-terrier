	<brief_title>Post-Market Study Modular Revision Hip System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) restore patient 's hip function repair patient 's kinematics . However , revision hip surgery represent challenge even experienced surgeon . Loss bone stock , joint stability , infection , fracture , trochanteric non-union , difficulty implant cement removal potential issue surgeon must consider present patient . These challenge require hip implant system provide intraoperative flexibility normally required primary THA . The Lima Modular Revision Hip System use modular stem neck component allow surgical versatility select leg length , offset version . The purpose study examine short term safety efficacy Modular Revision Hip System ( MHRS ) use radiologic success Harris Hip Scores endpoint . The study take place multiple sit across United States include subject meet indication use criterion Modular Revision Hip system candidate revision hip replacement surgery . Target enrollment 200 subject 25 subject 15 site across United States .</detailed_description>
