	<brief_summary>Corneal collagen crosslinking ( CXL ) propose effective method reduce progression keratoconus corneal ectasia surgery , well possibly decrease steepness cornea pathology . During previous study CXL procedure , surface epithelial cell remove . Transepithelial crosslinking epithelium remove propose offer number advantage traditional crosslinking include increase safety profile reduce risk infection epithelial barrier break , faster visual recovery improve patient comfort early postoperative healing period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study investigate difference two regimens transepithelial crosslinking . The study compare two riboflavin dose regimen crosslinking procedure . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy transepithelial corneal collagen crosslinking perform riboflavin 0.1 % reduce corneal curvature . Safety efficacy outcome compare treatment group . In particular , compare two group regard efficacy reduce corneal curvature . Secondary outcome include visual acuity . Safety assessment include tabulation adverse event , patient symptom , loss visual acuity , change endothelial cell density , slit lamp examination cornea lens , contact lens tolerance contact lens wearer</detailed_description>
