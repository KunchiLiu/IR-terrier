	<brief_title>Effectiveness Individualized Exercise Program , Combined With Balanced Diet Evolution Body Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Reunion Island , 2000 REDIA study show prevalence type 2 diabetes among 30-69 year old people 17 % , prevalence obesity among woman 20 % 10 % men . According literature upon preventive strategy and/or treatment metabolic disease , regular physical activity associate balance diet intake fruit vegetable , reduce body fat mass prevent complication related obesity . These complication partly related inflammatory oxidative stress accompanies obesity . A diet rich fruit vegetable , may improve inflammatory oxidative status . However consensus intensity regular physical activity practice prevention care . These parameter generally individualize . International recommendation cover wide range exercise intensity ( 40 % 60 % maximal oxygen uptake ) . The research group Jacques Mercier ( CERAMM Lapeyronie-CHU Montpellier ) show benefit training conduct relatively low intensity effort , correspond maximum rate lipid oxidation ( LIPOXmax ) , effect fat mass , insulin sensitivity muscle metabolism , overweight obese people . Main objective : study effect three program rehabilitation train associate diet supplement fruit vegetable , reduce body fat overweight obese people . Secondary objective : study effect oxidative stress inflammatory status , compare efficacy 3 program physical train body composition modification , insulin sensitivity , lipid utilization exercise quality life , describe feasibility population ( compliance , motivation ) . Abstract : accord data literature , balance diet combined moderate exercise help fight biological complication relate obesity reduce incidence type 2 diabetes promote fat loss . But consensus intensity physical activity prescribe . Have show benefit train perform individualized intensity effort , relatively low , correspond maximum rate lipid oxidation measure indirect calorimeter ( LIPOXmax ) fat loss , sensitivity insulin muscle metabolism obese diabetic patient . However , individualize LIPOXmax exercise training yet compare standardized training conventionally use treatment obese subject . Furthermore , study yet evaluate impact LIPOXmax training inflammatory antioxidant status among overweight obese patient . We propose compare among overweight obese patient , effect individualize train intensity correspond LIPOXmax , effect standardize train 60 % VO2max , effect moderate regular physical activity prescribe accord guideline Good Medical Practices . At M0 participant anthropometric functional examination laboratory test , follow nutritional education session . They randomize 3 arm : arm 1 LIPOXmax physical activity , arm 2 60 % VO2max physical activity , arm 3 physical activity accord guideline Good Medical Practices . Participants arm 1 2 practice control sport instructor ; participant arm 3 regularly monitor telephone . The procedure last 5 month . At M3 M5 anthropometric biological examination replicate participant answer questionnaire quality life experience physical activity intervention . Primary outcome : body fat mass reduction , kilogram % total weight . Secondary outcome : improvement biological parameter ( marker inflammation antioxidant status , blood glucose , HbA1c , insulin , cholesterol , HDL / LDL , triglyceride ) ; improvement body composition ( weight , BMI , waist circumference , hip circumference , muscle mass ) , lipid utilization exercise ; improvement quality life ; demonstration feasibility population ( adherence , compliance ) . Study design : control , randomize , superiority , blind trial 126 people divide three arm 42 people per arm : arm 1 LIPOXmax intensity effort , arm 2 60 % VO2max intensity effort , arm 3 intensity effort accord Guidelines Good Medical Practices . Intervention : 126 subject undergo follow exam : weight , height , waist hip circumference , blood pressure , body fat measurement impedancemetry biphotonic absorptiometry , maximal cardiopulmonary exercise effort metabolic test ( indirect calorimeter determine LIPOXmax cross point substrate ) , laboratory test ( blood glucose , HbA1c , insulin , cholesterol total , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , CRP , albumin , creatinine , urinary parameter , antioxidant status , inflammatory marker ) ; questionnaires medical history sociodemographic data ; food survey ( frequency questionnaire , quantization photo ) , questionnaires physical activity ( Baecke amend ) , quality life ( SF-36 ) , experience physical activity . All participant initial nutritional education session receive free supplement 5 fruit vegetable per day intervention , random urine assay perform monitor consumption fruit vegetable . Participants randomize three arm . Arm 1 : LIPOXmax arm . Subjects perform physical activity 4x1 hour per week optimal intensity fat oxidation ( LIPOXmax ) measure indirect calorimeter . Arm 2 : physical activity standard arm ( 60 % VO2max measure cardio respiratory exercise test ) . Subjects realize 4 session per week duration session adjust arm 1 2 total energy expenditure session . Arm 3 : control arm . The subject initially receive recommendation good medical practice physical activity ( achieve least 3h30min per week `` moderate '' exercise ) . The intervention last 5 month total . For arm 1 2 : physical activity ergo meter bicycle control sport trainer , goal gradual empowerment . For arm 3 : self-directed activity regular telephone follow-up , hold book physical activity use pedometer walking session . Indemnization : participant receive monthly allowance constraint due participation . Number subject : highlight difference average change 1.5 kg fat mass , standard deviation 2.0 kg , first specie risk 1.67 % ( 5 % / 3 ) , power 80 % , necessary include 38 subject . In circumstance possible demonstrate theoretical minimum significant difference arm : - 2.3 % change 5 month average percentage body fat ( SD = 3 % ) - 3.8 kg change 5 month average weight ( SD = 5 kg ) . Due miss data ( dropout , lose ) rate estimate 10 % , plan include 42 subject per arm , 126 total . Statistical analysis : single analysis intention treat ( arm assign randomization ) . Overall first specie risk = 5 % . Bilateral formulation statistical test . Statistical method use : bivariate analysis ( one factor ANOVA , Pearson Chi2 test Fisher test ) , multivariate analysis ( ANCOVA , logistic regression ) . Taking account longitudinal data ( M0-M3-M5 ) generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) . Graphic representation evolution study .</detailed_description>
