	<brief_title>Add-on Study Pentoxifylline Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failure first line therapy cutaneous leishmaniasis public health issue . Since pathogenesis dermal leishmaniasis mediate immune inflammatory response , resolution disease control infection intimately link host response . Several investigation substantiate `` proof principal '' therapeutic gain co-adjuvant immunotherapy . This study evaluate efficacy safety use pentoxifylline ( PTX ) co-adjuvant treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis meglumine antimoniate randomize , double-blind , control trial . One arm receive meglumine antimoniate PTX arm receive meglumine antimoniate plus placebo . Efficacy assessed end treatment , 5 , 7 , 13 26 week initiation treatment . Efficacy measure proportion patient definitive cure 26 week initiation treatment , time healing . Safety assess end treatment respect frequency severity adverse event . Blood sample take evaluate effect PTX invitro ex vivo cell immune system . Proliferation secretion cytokine relevant immune inflammatory response peripheral blood mononuclear cell measure treatment . Likewise , macrophage differentiate peripheral blood monocyte infect strain L. panamensis transfected luciferase ( luc ) gene . The investigator measure capacity patient macrophage kill parasites treatment use luminometric assay viable parasite burden . Additionally , investigator measure expression inducible nitric oxide synthase , enzyme necessary nitric oxide production , one main leishmanicidal mechanism use macrophage . The investigator postulate use co-adjuvant antimonials increase therapeutic response indicator predictive heal response identify prospective analysis immune response therapeutic outcome .</detailed_description>
