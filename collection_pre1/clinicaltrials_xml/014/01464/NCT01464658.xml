	<brief_summary>Patients morbid obesity often develop significant overhang abdominal pannus . Problems associate overhang pannus include difficulty perform routine daily activity well exercise due cumbersome nature excess tissue . In addition , abdominal pannus tissue often become infected due difficulty hygiene abnormal circulation lymphatic flow . There may also significant contribution pannus patient 's underlying cardiopulmonary status often compromise morbid obesity patient . In addition weight loss , one treatment strategy include panniculectomy . A panniculectomy involve resection excess abdominal skin fat wedge shape low abdomen . Purported benefit include increase ability exercise , good quality life improve cardiopulmonary function . However , significant morbidity associate panniculectomy surgery , wound related complication occur much 50 % patient procedure . The investigator hypothesize panniculectomy procedure provide long term benefit patient population despite significant short term morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Functional Quality Life Outcomes Panniculectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective trial determine functional quality life benefit achieve panniculectomy . Patients evaluate preoperatively postoperatively specific intervention aim describe functional status . These intervention include : echocardiogram , pulmonary function testing , arterial blood gas , functional capacity evaluation physical therapy , quality life survey . The investigative intervention perform postoperatively 6 month 1 year post surgery . Data also gather complication wound infection , dehiscence , cardiopulmonary problem . There additional risk patient surgery procedure list already perform routinely patient population . Study participant morbid obesity significant overhang pannus require surgical intervention . This study compare preoperative value post operative value take 6 month 1 year post operative . These value include echocardiogram , pulmonary function test , arterial blood gas functional capacity evaluation .</detailed_description>
