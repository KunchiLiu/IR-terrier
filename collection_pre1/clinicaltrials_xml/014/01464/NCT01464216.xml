	<brief_title>MRI Assessment Hypoxia-Induced Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective study include 180 consecutive patient PCa refer Oslo University Hospital , Radiumhospitalet , surgical treatment . In vivo functional MRI examination perform within day prior robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RALP ) . For subgroup patient FACBC PET also acquire prior prostatectomy . A subgroup intermediate high-risk patient ( D'Amico risk classification ) prior surgery receive intravenous infusion hypoxia-marker pimonidazole ( Hypoxyprobe™-1 ) * . During surgery , bone marrow aspiration blood collection perform assessment disseminate circulate tumor cell . High-risk patient undergo intraoperative lymph node dissection . Tumor tissue molecular analysis sample prostate specimen prior fixation . Prostate specimen regional lymph node histopathologically examine T- N-classification , Gleason grade , presence micrometastasis area hypoxia . Histological molecular finding correlate MRI PET finding clinical data . Patients longitudinally follow assess long-time clinical outcome ( recurrence , metastatic disease , death ) . *From 2013 oral administration use .</detailed_description>
