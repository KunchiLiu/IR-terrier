	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) infect approximately 50 % adult population well recognize main cause gastritis , peptic ulcer disease gastric cancer . The cure H. pylori infection prevents recurrence duodenal gastric ulcer improve dyspepsia significant proportion case , cost-effective . Eradication therapy change time . Recent meta-analyses current global eradication rate standard triple therapy ( STT ) less 80 % . Several European study find even low eradication rate , 35-40 % case result treatment failure , probably due increase resistance antibiotic many geographical area , principally clarithromycin . The usually recommended pattern American European ( Maastricht III ) consensus conference 2007 traditionally triple therapy , compose combination 2 antibiotic ( clarithromycin plus amoxicillin metronidazole ) proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) 7-14 day . However , triple therapy discourage setting high rate clarithromycin resistance ( 15-20 % ) , , new strategy order improve efficacy first-line treatment require . Treatment failure increase antibiotic resistant strain , lead second treatment new diagnostic test confirm eradication . Unfortunately , remain unknown whether room improvement geographical area use clarithromycin-containing therapy switch bismuth quadruple therapy follow instead .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Justification study : Several non-bismuth quadruple clarithromycin-containing regimen raise last decade aim substitute standard triple therapy ( STT ) first-line H. pylori eradication therapy . Sequential therapy , introduce Italy , involve 5-day induction phase dual therapy ( PPI every 12 hour amoxicillin 1g every 12 hour ) , follow immediately triple therapy 5 day PPI every 12 hour , metronidazole 500 mg every 12 hour clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hour . 10-day sequential therapy prove effectiveness STT excellent treatment compliance minimal side effect . However , efficacy sequential therapy seem notably impaired clarithromycin resistance dual clarithromycin metronidazole resistance , become common scenario developed country . Other interest resurface therapeutic alternative non-bismuth quadruple therapy ( NBQT ) , also call `` concomitant '' therapy , include PPI , amoxicillin , clarithromycin nitroimidazole , drug give concurrently twice daily . It also demonstrate superiority STT could potential replacement STT first-line regimen . However , NBQT might several advantage sequential therapy , namely , less complexity patient physician , twice duration prescribed antibiotic , proper validation process worldwide high efficacy sequential therapy clarithromycin dual-resistant H. pylorus . Finally , another recent innovation 14-day quadruple clarithromycin-based regimen , so-called sequential-concomitant `` hybrid '' therapy , involve PPI amoxicillin 7 day plus 7-day course NBQT . Outstanding cure rate close 100 % recently report use scheme , thereby require consideration . Therefore necessary make control clinical trial directly compare NBQT `` hybrid '' versus `` concomitant '' therapy setting document high clarithromycin resistance rate . In order maximize efficacy eradication regimen , would necessary extend duration 14 day use high-dose PPI ( omeprazole 40 mg bid ) . The result study conclude whether still room clarithromycin-containing regimen H. pylori eradication even setting high antibiotic resistance rate .</detailed_description>
