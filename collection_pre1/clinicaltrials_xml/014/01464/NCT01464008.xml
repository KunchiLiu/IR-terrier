	<brief_summary>The efficacy combination antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis C influence many factor . Important patient-specific factor include , age , gender , race , body weight . Important virus-specific factor include HCV genotype serum HCV RNA level . Finally , important treatment-related factor include type interferon , dose ribavirin duration adherence treatment . Despite importance patient- virus-specific factor , important indicator treatment success rapid , profound sustain decrease serum HCV RNA level start treatment . The on-treatment virological response thus use predict probability give patient achieve SVR remain therapy . It also use individualize duration treatment . In study , treatment patient chronic hepatitis C individualized basis clinical characteristic on-treatment virological response . The aim investigate usefulness undetectable HCV RNA level week 4 ( RVR ) 12 tailor duration treatment predict SVR Chinese patient chronic hepatitis C .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>297 consecutive patient chronic hepatitis C admit hospital treat outpatient Beijing Ditan Hospital eligible study . The diagnosis chronic hepatitis C base detection anti-HCV antibody ( anti-HCV ) third generation microparticle chemoluminescence assay HCV RNA reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay . Patients require evidence HCV infection least 6 month . patient receive peginterferon alfa-2a ( 40KD ) ( Pegasys® ; Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) 135 180 µg subcutaneous injection weekly . Among treatment-naive patient , duration therapy determine HCV genotype on-treatment virological response week 4 , 12 24 . Genotype 1 infected patient assign complete 48~72 week treatment , respond previous course therapy assign complete total 72 week treatment . Dose adjustment : In event patient achieve RVR week 4 , provide experience adverse event , daily dosage ribavirin increase 200 mg 300 mg , case start treatment low dosage peginterferon alfa-2a ( 40KD ) conventional interferon alfa , dosage peginterferon alfa-2a ( 40KD ) increase 135 µg/week 180 µg/week . In event adverse event could ameliorate symptomatic treatment , dose peginterferon alfa-2a ( 40KD ) reduce 180 µg/week 135 µg/week ribavirin 200 mg/day 300 mg/day . Quantitative HCV RNA test perform start treatment ( week 0 ) , week 4 , 12 , 24 , end treatment , 24 week completion treatment use commercially available real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR kit . The primary efficacy end-point achievement SVR define undetectable HCV RNA end 24-week untreated follow-up period . The percentage patient undetectable HCV RNA ( &lt; 500 copies/mL ) week 4 ( RVR ) , 12 secondary efficacy endpoint .</detailed_description>
