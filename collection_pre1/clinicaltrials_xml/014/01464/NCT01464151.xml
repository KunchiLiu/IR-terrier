	<brief_summary>Both ulcerative colitis Crohn 's colitis associate increase risk develop colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Although increase risk CRC colitis patient well establish , several study show risk varies widely patient , depend presence risk factor . Recently , several risk factor implement updated British guideline surveillance use determine surveillance interval center . The new guideline recommend stratification patient high , medium low risk group depend presence clinical endoscopic risk factor adjust surveillance interval accordingly . Although guideline provide first step towards individualize surveillance regimen , current data regarding risk factor IBD-associated CRC solely base retrospective study . Prospective data phenotype genotype reliably predict risk CRC need optimize surveillance future . Objectives : 1 . To confirm establish identify new predictive factor colorectal cancer prospective cohort IBD patient undergo regular surveillance . Dysplasia colorectal cancer primary outcome . 2 . To provide evidence mucosal heal result significant reduction colorectal dysplasia/neoplasia IBD patient associate 5-ASA anti-TNF maintenance therapy . 3 . Study expression several tumor marker biopsy , blood faeces baseline determine whether expression marker predict dysplasia colorectal cancer development follow-up .</brief_summary>
