	<detailed_description>An open label uncontrolled study determine efficacy fosmidomycin clindamycin co-administered orally three day treatment acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria child . The primary study endpoint cure rate Day 28 ( PCR correct ) . The secondary endpoint cure rate Day 7 parasite fever clearance time . Study population A total 40 child recruit study . Sample size calculation make basis trial aim substantiate efficacy result obtain child Gabon . In large trial drug combination do Gabon , 51 child recruit , per-protocol , PCR-adjusted day 28 cure rate 89 % ( 42/47 ; 95 % CI , 77 96 % ) . Based expect 90 % efficacy estimate , sample size 35 child produce two-sided 95 % confidence interval estimate precision 20 % . Allowing attrition rate 10 % non-evaluable subject , sample size 40 subject require . Study endpoints Primary The primary endpoint cure rate Day 28 ( PCR correct ) . Secondary The secondary endpoint cure rate Day 7 parasite fever clearance time . Withdrawal criterion treatment ( classify therapeutic failure ) - Severe deterioration clinical condition - Signs severe malaria , accord WHO criteria - Onset drug relate serious adverse event - Repeated vomit within one hour re-dosing Discontinuation criterion completion treatment ( classify therapeutic failure ) - Persistent parasitaemia 96 hour initiation treatment - Parasitaemia follow-up period initial clearance - No reduction parasitaemia within 48 hour initiation treatment - Onset drug relate serious adverse event Discontinuation criterion completion treatment ( classify therapeutic failure ) - Withdrawal guardian consent - Loss follow - Protocol violation Procedure treatment The study drug administer direct supervision study clinician nurse dos fosmidomycin 30mg/kg/dose + clindamycin 10mg/kg/dose twice daily three day ( total daily dose fosmidomycin 60mg/kg , clindamycin 20mg/kg ) . In event vomit within one hour dosing , dose drug re-administered supplemental drug supply . Re-dosing do drug administration twice whole treatment period . Concomitant treatment Subjects treat symptoms adverse event study period standard treatment . Drugs antimalarial activity likely effect parasitaemia permit study . This include artemether-lumefantrine combination , artesunate , sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination , chloroquine , amodiaquine co-trimoxazole . Trial procedure duration study A general physical examination perform admission study . All subject hospitalise minimum three day asymptomatic aparasitaemic . Brief examination conduct daily period weekly thereafter assess general physical status . Thereafter subject return out-patient follow-up day 7 ± 1 day , 14 ± 2 day , 21 ± 2 day 28 ± 2 day . All subject expect participate trial total duration 28 day . Those subject attend follow-up locate member study staff provide transportation hospital schedule examination ascertain reason fail attend .</detailed_description>
