	<detailed_description>- Breast cancer commonest cancer affect woman UK . Current guideline state ; disease permitting , female due undergo mastectomy breast cancer offer reconstruction . Autologous free tissue transfer use abdominal tissue remain excellent option breast reconstruction due readily available fatty tissue low donor site morbidity . In recent year trend base abdominal tissue perforate vessel rather routinely harvest muscle along flap ; thus potentially reduce donor site morbidity . Abdominal tissue base upon Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator ( DIEP ) system well recognise option breast reconstruction . - This procedure involve harvest lower abdominal tissue base blood supply one Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforating Arteries concomitant vein . These branch External iliac artery perforate rectus muscle intertendinous intersection . - A large volume tissue harvest base single perforator . - Hartrampf divide abdominal tissue distinct perfusion zone I-IV base upon location perforate artery . Zone I overlie perforate vessel , Zone II across midline adjacent perforate vessel . Zone III ipsilateral periphery perforate vessel Zone IV furthest periphery contralateral side perforator . Over year undergone debate many advocate zone II-III ( accord Hartrampfs original classification ) switch . However everyone remain clear term Zone IV . Zone IV classically area flap receives least perfusion/drainage perforate vessel liable undergo congestion tissue ischaemia lead fat/skin necrosis . As many surgeon routinely excise zone IV DIEP flap prior transfer chest defect . This obviously lead reduction volume tissue available reconstruction . - Classically problem zone IV / flap perfusion tend relate venous congestion . - Many surgeon advocate use superficial inferior epigastric vein `` lifeboat '' vessel salvage congest DIEP publish result . - There however in-vivo study show full contribution superficial vascular system flap base primarily upon Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforating Vessels . A recent study use preoperative CTs show `` macrovascular-shunts '' deep arterial system superficial venous system implication yet establish . - Fluoroscopy use indocyanine green establish method look tissue perfusion free flap . - Laser Doppler image another well describe technique monitoring / assessment tissue perfusion plastic surgery operation . - By understand perfusion DIEP flap investigator hope improve flap survivability also volume flap use . - Patients due undergo breast reconstruction free DIEP flap senior researcher/surgeon identify . - On day operation DIEP flap raise normal one DIEP arteries either side . The superficial vascular system dissect free contralateral side . - The flap scan Laser Doppler Imaging SPY scanner ( indocyanine green angiography couple fluoroscopy ) - This take place randomize fashion follow - Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery Clamped ; Vein Unclamped - Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery Unclamped ; Vein Clamped - Both Artery Vein Clamped - Both Artery And Vein Unclamped - There 5minute pause intervention allow perfusion stabilize . Previous research ( await publication ) within department show necessary amount time allow stabilization . - The scanning period carry natural rest break operate surgeon add significantly length procedure . - Once scan process finish operation proceed standard DIEP flap disconnect abdomen reconnected chest reconstruct breast .</detailed_description>
