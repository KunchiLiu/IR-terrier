	<brief_summary>Pleuropulmonary Blastoma ( PPB ) rare establish `` standard '' `` best '' therapy . For many year , child PPB around world treat accord decision make case-by-case many different hospital many different physician . No treatment test large group PPB patient . The goal treat many child one treatment program learn result treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma ( PPB ) Treatment Biology Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Registry collect family medical history establishes collection specimen PPB patient parent future research . Primary goal biology research ( 1 ) identify new scientific way learn PPB best way treat future ( 2 ) establish collection PPB biologic specimens future research . Background : PPB rare cancer lung present early childhood , mostly birth age ~72 month . PPB occur within lung lung chest wall . There three form PPB call Types I , II , III PPB . Children Type I PPB require surgery sometimes chemotherapy . Children Types II III PPB , require surgery , chemotherapy sometimes radiation therapy . Because never consensus best treatment PPB , Registry provide treatment guideline . It goal Treatment Biology Registry offer specific regimen Registry able prospectively review analyze regimen first time . Design : - Diagnostic central pathology review require patient prospectively evaluate . - This Treatment Registry offer surgery chemotherapy regimen guideline , optional radiation therapy guideline prospectively enrol patient . - The Treatment Biology Registry create PPB biologic specimen reference bank tumor . Methods : - For Type I PPB , surgery necessary . Some doctor use chemotherapy surgery . If chemotherapy use Registry suggest combination chemotherapy vincristine , dactinomycin , cyclophosphamide ( VAC ) . - For Types II III PPB patient surgery necessary , follow chemotherapy . The Registry suggest subject receive combination chemotherapy Ifosphamide , Vincristine , Actinomycin-D Doxorubicin ( IVADo ) . Second look possible 3rd look surgery may require . Radiation therapy recommend residual disease maximum surgery . Analysis : Statistical data analysis include centrally confirm case . Additionally patient PPB Type II Type III enrol treated IVADo per regimen compare historical control . No statistical analysis plan patient Type I PPB . Future treatment compare IVADo regimen order measure improvement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : Patients birth &lt; 21 year age time diagnosis . 2 . Pathology Diagnosis : Patients newlydiagnosed PPB Types I , II III . Diagnosis make local pathologist . All case must submit central pathology review . Only centrallyreviewed case confirm PPB analyze prospectively . Cases initial diagnosis `` suggestive '' `` supportive '' PPB , diagnostic , late resection specimen , include resection follow chemotherapy , confirm PPB diagnosis include . Patients diagnose fine needle aspiration biopsy include late resection specimen , include resection follow chemotherapy , diagnostic PPB . 3 . Prior Therapy : PPB Type I : All patient eligible follow study . PPB Types II III : Newlydiagnosed Types II III PPB patient include Treatment Biology Registry . 4 . Prior corticosteroid therapy allow . 5 . Patients receive chemotherapy regimen radiation therapy statistical analysis . 6 . Types II III PPB patient PRIOR Type I PPB diagnosis : Types II III PPB case recurrence earlier Type I PPB include chemotherapy use Type I disease . 7 . Informed consent parent/guardian . ( also , appropriate : assent HIPPA consent )</criteria>
