	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Using MASTER Perform Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Human</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial evaluate safety efficacy use MASTER , novel robotics enhance endosurgical system perform endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) gastric/colon cancer human . The MASTER master-and-slave robotic system deploy standard dual-channel therapeutic endoscope . It introduce robotic control endoscopic surgical tool task ergonomic human-machine interface build around original endoscopic paradigm . In , separate control instrumental motion endoscopic movement surgical task may independently execute second operator via human-machine interface . With , endoscopically deployed instrument independently control , allow thus bimanual coordination effector instrument facilitate action retraction/exposure , traction/countertraction , approximation dissection tissue . Using MASTER , operational dexterity increase , thus make easy operator perform ESD procedure compare use conventional endoscope . This study measure ease use MASTER perform various surgical task involve ESD procedure , time take perform procedure , record complication , , occur procedure .</detailed_description>
