	<brief_title>Study EvAluating Genotypes While Using Lucentis 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) progressive disease cause irreversible visual impairment blindness nearly 50 million people globally . Although geographic atrophy neovascularization represent advance form AMD , neovascular AMD aggressive form account almost 90 % blindness disease . It characterize choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) development abnormal blood vessel underneath retina . Randomized clinical trial ( MARINA , ANCHOR ) conclusively demonstrate continued intravitreal therapy Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) patient subfoveal CNV AMD lead stabilization vision 90 % patient improvement vision least third patient lead approval Lucentis treatment neovascular AMD ( see investigator brochure ) . This study could provide insight reason patient experience vision stabilization Lucentis , could possibly help physician determine patient best candidate receive Lucentis . This open-label study 100 treatment-naïve ( study eye ) AMD patient treat on-label intravitreally administer Lucentis . Consented , enrol subject receive multiple open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer monthly first 4 month , need total duration 12 month . Their blood genotyped sequence various SNPs VEGF HTRA1 .</detailed_description>
