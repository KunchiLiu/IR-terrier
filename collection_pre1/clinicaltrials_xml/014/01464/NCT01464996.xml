	<detailed_description>CLINICAL RESEARCH PLAN Introduction This randomize clinical trial involve restoration evaluation 83 ( target enrollment 80 ) non-carious cervical lesion ( NCCLs ) use either new two-component self-etch universal adhesive OptiBond XTR control dental adhesive , OptiBond FL , nano-hybrid composite restorative material , Herculite Ultra . OptiBond XTR two-component self-etch , fill , fluoride releasing , light-cured bonding agent design universal bond direct indirect restoration . The study design base American Dental Association Acceptance Program Guidelines Dentin Enamel Adhesive Materials . Participant Selection Criteria Participants select basis require restoration non-carious cervical lesion . Participants few 20 teeth consider . The participant pool randomize much possible exclude bias due age ( 18 80 year old ) , sex , race , national origin , factor unusual dietary , habitual , oral hygiene factor might affect result . If participant pool include effect , acknowledge project report . Despite effort close equal number men woman study ( ADA Guidelines , 2001 ) , note report pool imbalanced towards woman ( enrol 20 female 4 male ) . However , believe gender imbalance affect bias result . Prior enrollment study , participant sign consent form . Both consent form research protocol review approved Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University North Carolina . IRB approval secure throughout study . Tooth Selection Criteria Any tooth include study contact oppose tooth normal occlusal relationship normal periodontal health . The dental health status participant consider normal respect except ongoing restorative procedure unrelated unopposed quadrant . Teeth restore non-carious cervical lesion ( NCCLs , abrasion/erosion/abfraction ) undercut . Class V carious lesion exclude . Normally , 50 % cavosurface margin involve enamel 75 % surface area defect involve dentin . All NCCLs characterize preoperatively relative height lesion , width , depth , percent margin enamel , internal angle lesion , degree sclerosis measure UNC Sclerosis Scale ( Appendix 1 ) . The shape lesion document `` saucer-shaped '' `` notch-shaped . '' Evidence stressful occlusion ( wear facet , fremitus ) also note . These clinical co-variables retrospectively analyzed retention failure occur assess potential cause effect relationship . Distribution Restorations ( Per Participant ) To minimize chance strong participant-related effect could distort outcome study , two restoration type material ( four total restoration ) per participant allow . Our initial target distribution restoration include approximately one-half anterior teeth one-half posterior teeth . A minimum 25 participant baseline , 20 participant 6 month , 15 participant 18 month require evaluation ( ADA Guidelines , 2001 ) . A randomized schedule prepare minimize effect operator , participant , material result study . Participants schedule accept study , operator schedule place restoration accord Department Operative Dentistry master schedule . For participant , adhesive use ( OptiBond XTR OptiBond FL ) first restoration place choose flip coin , subsequent restoration ( one tooth restore participant ) do use adhesive . Consequently , participant two lesion restore , he/she receive adhesive . Every effort make distribute restoration evenly mouth , i.e. , restoration place adhesive equally distribute anterior/posterior teeth , maxillary/mandibular teeth . Tooth Preparation Procedures All tooth preparation modify design ( describe Sturdevant 's Art Science Operative Dentistry , 6th edition , 2012 ) . The preparation include retentive groove bevel . The dentin enamel wall preparation lightly roughen coarse diamond stone . Tooth preparation limit roughen involved surface produce definite finish line , indicate . Operative procedure perform use local anesthesia need . The operating sit isolated cotton roll retraction cord , rubber dam , depend access location lesion . Tooth Restoration Procedures OptiBond XTR OptiBond FL apply accord specific direction supply manufacturer . The preparation restore light-cured nanoparticle resin-based composite material ( Herculite Ultra ) . The composite inserted increment 2 mm less . Each increment fully polymerize accord composite shade le 20 second use Demi Plus LED light-curing unit determine provided manufacturer . After polymerization , finish accomplish 12-fluted tapered and/or flame-shaped carbide finishing bur use light intermittent pressure avoid damaging margin . Polishing accomplished slow speed polish brush ( Occlubrush , Axis Dental ) aluminum-oxide polish disc ( OptiDisc , Axis Dental ) accessible . Records There many factor might contribute retention and/or microleakage failure . For reason , follow item record project data form ( see Appendix 3 example data form ) restoration place course study : 1 . Identification # operator 2 . Tooth # restoration 3 . Participant 's age gender restoration 4 . Isolation method ( e.g. , cotton roll , retraction cord , rubber dam ) 5 . Number increment restorative composite 6 . Shade composite 7 . Total polymerization time adhesive composite 8 . Finishing technique instrument use 9 . Any unusual step and/or event ( e.g. , contamination require additional etching and/or application adhesive ) Standardization Clinicians ( Operators ) This study conduct four operator experience trial design . For purpose initial standardization , project personnel meet review procedure detail , compare individual assessment procedure . They discuss difficulty potential problem finalize detail clinical procedure . All involved operator full-time faculty Department Operative Dentistry year experience clinical research . During course insertion , patient coordinator primary responsibility continual assessment standardization . Any procedural step ordinary record project data form ( comment section ) sign . In addition , principal investigator review point periodic meeting project personnel . CLINICAL EVALUATION PLAN Clinical Evaluation Times The restoration evaluate insertion ( baseline ) 6 month , evaluate 18 month , optional three-year evaluation . This document report data collect 6 month evaluation visit . Direct Evaluation Criteria Procedures Each restoration evaluate follow characteristic : 1 . Retention 2 . Color match 3 . Cavosurface margin discoloration 4 . Secondary caries 5 . Anatomic form 6 . Marginal adaptation and/or integrity 7 . Post operative sensitivity United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) direct evaluation procedure conduct use method report Ryge 1973 . See Appendix 2 complete description Direct Evaluation Criteria . Retention record completely retain ( alfa ) partially completely lose ( charlie ) . All restoration evaluate independently two operator . Consensus determine consultation evaluation . The individual consensus value record data sheet . The consensus value participant baseline recall period record participant case card . The case card data transfer directly summary sheet contain data participant treat . Indirect Evaluation Criteria Procedures Intraoral photograph best method document color matching , interfacial staining , occlusal pattern . Intraoral color photograph take baseline ( restoration placement ) take evaluation appointment permanent record subsequent indirect evaluation later reference . Pre-operative photographs consist one image defect restore . Clinical photographs high-quality digital image make original magnification 1.5x use principally reference document direct evaluation . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Experimental Questions This study evaluate retention aspect new two-component self-etch adhesive system non-retentive cervical defect compare resin adhesive system document performance . The study design result compare result previous clinical trial ADA guideline . Experimental Design This randomized clinical trial design equivalence trial , i.e. , overall hypothesis test clinical performance OptiBond XRT , measure USPHS criterion describe , equivalent OptiBond FL , excellent document clinical performance . In order minimize possible participant operator effect result study , assignment participant operator material teeth randomize ( see section Distribution Restorations per Participant ) . Participants assign operator order screening . Data Analysis Individual clinical evaluation consensus value shall record recall visit sign evaluator . Categorical ( USPHS ) value tabulate incidence value report comparison specification limit . Any failure clinical study count failure subsequent recall . The restoration ' failure rate calculate use follow equation : Failure Percentage = [ ( PF+NF ) / ( PF+RR ) ] x 100 % PF = Number previous failure current recall NF = Number new failure current recall RR = Number restoration recall current recall Because study design equivalence trial , power calculation base expect difference adhesive system , rather differences performance system across time ( baseline versus evaluation time ) . For estimate 30 percent difference clinically unacceptable score baseline 3 year , sample size use adequately power study 85 percent . At baseline , data subject ' age , sex occlusion , lesion characteristic operator may compare two restorative system use two-sample test ( continuous variable ) χ2 ( categorical variable ) , determine two group equivalent . The lesion characteristic evaluate internal angle , percentage enamel margin , sclerosis scale value , lesion size ( height , width depth ) volume . Modified USPHS direct evaluation criterion score restoration place OptiBond XTR OptiBond FL compare evaluation time statistically significant difference use Fisher exact test ( P = 0.05 ) . Lesions/restorations use unit analysis ( case ) . Although restoration place participant totally independent case , assignment restoration participant randomize . Therefore , subject lesion characteristic expect affect outcome . However , test influence characteristic performance restorative system , logistic regression use control factor operator ; subject 's age , sex occlusion ; lesion 's location , size score sclerosis scale . Finally , run survival analysis derive Kaplan-Meier survival estimate curve clinically unacceptable ( Charlie ) score USPHS criterion different follow-up time . A log rank test equality survivor function use compare survival estimate two restorative system . We use Stata 10 data analysis statistical software ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas ) statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
