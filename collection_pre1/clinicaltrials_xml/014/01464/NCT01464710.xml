	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness develop world . To date , two major polymorphism HTRA1 CFH gene associate AMD . Progression vision loss need follow treat promptly order preserve vision . This study provide information genetics disease progression may lead future guideline patient follow-up treatment . This study consist blood draw observation eye condition . Consented , enrol patient come every four month per standard care . At visit , visual acuity measurement , slit lamp exam , indirect ophthalmoscopy , fundus photo , spectral domain optical coherence tomography perform . Every 8 month , per standard care , fluoroscein angiography perform . DNA extraction genotyping perform , correlation HTRA1 CFH genotypes progression bilateral advance AMD analyze .</detailed_description>
