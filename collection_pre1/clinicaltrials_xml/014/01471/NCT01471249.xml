	<brief_title>Quality Life Dysphagia Following Palliative Stenting Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one 10 frequent cancer world . The incidence esophageal cancer rapidly increase rapid rate cancer western world . The annual incidence report western country 3 per 100,000 . In central China report high 140 per 100,000 Linxian Province central China . Esophageal cancer remain one lethal malignancy . Once diagnosis establish , prognosis poor , 5-year survival rate le 10 % . Despite advance therapy , 50 % patient incurable disease time presentation one third patient localized disease experience long term survival . By appearance dysphagia time diagnosis , patient candidate esophagectomy symptoms present least 50 % circumference oesophagus involve . Distant metastasis usually establish time . The symptom dysphagia weight loss commonly experience significant impact quality life patient . This make palliative endoluminal stenting attractive option . The mainstay treatment palliation dysphagia result malignant stenosis intraluminal tumor growth . A number palliative therapy available treat physician . The option treat dysphagia cause advanced , unresectable esophageal cancer include : stenting , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , thermal laser ablation , external beam radiation brachytherapy . Brachytherapy offer safe palliation malignant dysphagia relatively long period . The result brachytherapy comparable palliative method . Increased effectiveness symptomatic improvement report combination external beam radiation high dose brachytherapy . The combination well tolerate relatively safe . Despite relatively safe , perforation stricture formation complication brachytherapy without external beam radiation . Furthermore , brachytherapy fall favour center due time amelioration symptom require multiple hospital visit repeat procedure . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) utilize photosensitize agent , light oxygen endoscopically ablate cancer cell . PDT suggest evaluate treatment high grade esophageal dysplasia intramucosal adenocarcinoma arise within Barrett 's oesophagus . Ablation PDT effective end stage esophageal cancer palliation improve malignant dysphagia . Esophagitis , photoreactions , perforation , strictures require dilatation still main complication PDT reason disappearance clinical practise . Laser thermal ablation commonly use method esophageal cancer palliation . Despite relatively good result , perforation , necessity re-intervention main concern limit use end stage esophageal cancer patient . Intra luminal esophageal stenting widely use effective method esophageal cancer palliation . Esophageal stent insertion prove effective method palliation malignant dysphagia . It relatively safe procedure low rate serious complication . In report 127 stent placement 100 patient , immediate relief dysphagia observe stent insertion 85 % patient . Adding proven efficacy treatment dysphagia , stenting proven offer palliation longer interventional free period method palliation . Over past decade , advance expandable stent technology lead small , flexible delivery system easier manipulate original plastic stent . These attribute permit successful deployment without expose patient risk aggressive mechanical dilatation . Stent insertion also effective method palliation esophageal cancer extrinsic compression ( metastatic mediastinal lymph node ) cause dysphagia . Stenting also play important role treatment patient airway - esophageal fistula . This study consist prospective clinical trial aim evaluate impact stent insertion palliation malignant dysphagia . The main goal examine number day require follow stenting order significant improvement dysphagia length time baseline maintain . Hypothesis : Intraluminal esophageal stenting improves malignant dysphagia quality life almost immediately stent insertion effect maintain short medium term inoperable esophageal cancer patient . Objectives : - To assess effectiveness esophageal stenting improve malignant dysphagia assess time period relate improvement - To assess effectiveness esophageal stenting improve quality assess time period relate improvement Study design : Prospective non-interventional clinical trial . Methods : Patients malignant dysphagia schedule palliative endoluminal esophageal stenting prospectively enrol trial . All patient eligible study consent study investigator outpatient clinic prior procedure . Study investigator administer questionnaire follow consent . Patients undergo standard endoscopic intervention intraluminal esophageal stent insertion . Assessment dysphagia score perform immediately prior procedure , procedure ( day 0 ) , well day 1 7 , every week 4 week post procedure . Questionnaires perform study investigator take place either clinic operation Notre-Dame hospital hospital stay . Later questionnaires perform telephone interview . Analysis aim compare dysphagia quality life score baseline ( pre-procedure ) value post-procedural value . The time achieve steady state also assess . Maintenance improve quality life low dysphagia score also assess . Secondary outcome survival analysis base stage .</detailed_description>
