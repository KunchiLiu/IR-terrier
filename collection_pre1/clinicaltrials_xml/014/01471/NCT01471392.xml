	<brief_summary>The overall goal present study provide evidence concordant test result use Identigene STD Test Collection Kit self-collection transport specimen qualify test laboratory . It expect method aid detection CT NG offer method self-collection male urine female vaginal swab specimen encourage test CT NG improve overall detection reporting STDs allow person suspect infection test discrete confidential manner . The reporting CT NG underestimate many subject visit clinic obtain treatment go undetected . Thus , allow self-collection kit convenient may result improved reporting , identification CT NG positive individual , subsequent treatment help prevent spread disease . The purpose study demonstrate Identigene STD Test Collection Kit label instruction use instruction provide test result concordant ( least 95 % good ) test result obtain use Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 specimen collection transport method perform supervision healthcare provider . The laboratory technology test method use IDTG-100 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter study involve asymptomatic symptomatic subject risk suspect possible exposure CT and/or NG . Approximately five ( 5 ) clinic participate study . The clinic select located diverse geographical region order represent population high low incidence CT NG represent different extreme climate . The initial phase study enrol approximately 500 qualify subject . An interim analysis perform determine whether change study protocol necessary . Changes protocol identify incorporated amendment ( amendment 4 ) study protocol . Specifically , male study still collect urine specimen whereas woman self-collect vaginal swab specimen . Study subject undergo one clinic visit rather two indicate prior version study protocol . The propose study phase outline amendment study protocol include least 200 qualify subject intermittent suspension study allow data analysis . The present study continue 200 CT positive test result ( approximately 100 male 100 female ) obtain . Of 200 positive result , approximately 50 % symptomatic subject 50 % asymptomatic subject . Since positivity rate presumably lower asymptomatic subject , ration symptomatic asymptomatic subject enrollment study phase determine sponsor make know write study site . It expect approximately 3,000 subject require meet overall study objective . It anticipate total number subject enrol test throughout study yield approximately 30 positive NG sample ( approximately 15 male 15 female ) requirement specific ratio symptomatic asymptomatic subject . Subjects high risk exposure suspect exposure CT NG , currently treat , recruit enrollment .</detailed_description>
