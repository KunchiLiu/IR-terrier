At particular site woman also answer question management pessary ( e.g . take intercourse ) surround sexual activity . The recruitment goal study 150 woman , 75 group . This calculated detect significant difference rate bacterial vaginosis control study group ( Î±=0.05 ) , assume baseline bacterial vaginosis approximately 10 % population increase 30 % hypothetical risk factor , sample size need group 62 power 80 % . Assuming 15 % dropout rate recruitment , plan randomize least 75 patient control group 75 patient study group total least 150 patient . 60 woman recruit study initial site Washington Hospital Center Washington , D.C . This study site close June 2012 . In January 2013 study open University New Mexico Albuquerque , NM . The study currently open run University New Mexico recruitment goal 90 woman institution . The primary outcome measure rate bacterial vaginosis study population , compare control ( non Trimo-San use ) study ( Trimo-San use ) group . As part analysis , also compare rate bacterial vaginosis control study group pessary initiation . Secondary outcome include : - Change vaginal symptom assess questionnaire initiation pessary use - Change level worry distress vaginal symptom assess questionnaire initiation pessary use . - Change vaginal symptom distress symptom assess questionnaire base use non-use Trimo-San gel . - Describe management woman pessary surround sexual activity ( University New Mexico ) - Change body image sexual function associate initiation pessary use TrimoSan gel ( University New Mexico )</detailed_description>
