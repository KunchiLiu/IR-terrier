	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Tolerability MLN8237 , In Combination With Erlotinib Treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety tolerability combination treatment . ( Phase I ) II . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MLN8237 ( alisertib ) give combination standard dose erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . ( Phase I ) III . Progression free survival . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter erlotinib MLN8237 , include , limited maximum concentration drug ( Cmax ) , time occurrence maximum drug concentration ( Tmax ) , area curve time zero last measurable concentration ( AUC0-t last ) . II . Overall response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DOR ) , time progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase II ) III . Adverse event ( AEs ) , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , assessments clinical laboratory value . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study alisertib follow phase II study . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
