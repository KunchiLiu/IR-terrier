	<brief_summary>Combining Sorafenib standard cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine therapy advance colorectal cancer may provide clinical benefit treatment remain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Plus Capecitabine ( SorCape ) Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway important mediator response growth factor , strong inducer gene involve tumorigenesis , angiogenesis , apoptosis , tumorigenesis metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . Inhibition pathway previously prove highly clinically beneficial patient disease . It also clearly demonstrated inhibition VEGF , couple cytotoxic therapy and/or continue beyond initial response , improve clinical outcome survival cohort patient . Safety pharmacokinetic data already establish novel doublet oral chemotherapy . This study intend determine activity combination oral fluoropyrimidine plus sorafenib advanced mCRC patient population limit treatment option remain .</detailed_description>
