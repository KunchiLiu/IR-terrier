	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy ELAD® respect overall survival ( OS ) subject clinical diagnosis alcohol-induced liver decompensation ( AILD ) least Study Day 91 , follow-up Protocol VTI-208E provide additional survival data maximum 5 year include , available , VTI-208 study termination ( last surviving enrol subject completes Study Day 91 ) . Secondary objective determine proportion survivor Study Days 28 91 . Exploratory objective evaluate ability ELAD stabilize liver function , measure use Model End Stage Liver Disease ( MELD ) -based time progression ( TTP ) Study Day 91 , proportion progression-free survivor ( PFS ) Study Days 28 91 . Progression define death first observe increase least 5 point End Study Day 1 MELD score ( ELAD Control group ) least 24 hour ELAD Treatment Period end ( end Day 7 Controls ) End Study Days 28 91 follow Randomization .</brief_summary>
