	<detailed_description>Asthma disease characterise chronic airway inflammation , bronchial hyper-reactivity variable airflow obstruction . Eosinophils usually prominent airway inflammation see asthma consider central cause pathogenesis asthma . The expression interleukin ( IL ) -5 elevate bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid bronchial biopsy patient asthma . Moreover , level IL-5 BAL fluid bronchial mucosa correlate disease severity . The cytokine IL-5 promotes eosinophil differentiation , recruitment survival . Thus therapeutic strategy block IL-5 , thereby suppress eosinophilic inflammation , may therapeutic benefit asthma . SB-240563 ( mepolizumab ) humanize monoclonal antibody block human interleukin 5 ( hIL-5 ) binding receptor . Initial clinical study investigate safety efficacy SB-240563 treatment asthma atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . SB-240563 consistently significantly reduce peripheral tissue eosinophils patient atopic condition , include asthma , healthy volunteer . SB-240563 currently development severe refractory asthma Phase IIB dose-ranging study use IV route administration currently ongoing . This study single-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , dose ascend , single dose study Japanese healthy male subject . Since first study conduct Japanese subject , dose SB-240563 administer ascend order . In study conduct non-Japanese subject , SB-240563 well-tolerated follow single repeat intravenous dose 750 mg ( SB-240563/006 , SB-240563/036 MEE103226 ) . Intravenous repeat dos 75 mg , 250 mg 750 mg administer non-Japanese asthma patient on-going Phase II study . In consideration fact , single intravenous administration 4 dos ( 10 mg , 75 mg , 250 mg 750 mg ) SB-240563 administer study . A single intravenous dose 10 mg administer order explore effect lower dose SB-240563 previously study blood eosinophil count . This low dose expect help characterize concentration-response relationship base blood eosinophil . This study design randomize , parallel group , placebo-controlled , single-blind study evaluate pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , safety tolerability SB-240563 Japanese male subject .</detailed_description>
