	<detailed_description>Infections one serious ventricular assist device ( VAD ) relate complication . Many infection associate significant patient morbidity mortality . Diagnosis infection often difficult due complicate nature patient 's medical problem , need rapid institution empiric antibiotic therapy lack establish criterion define infection . Staphylococci among common cause VAD infection . The basis high incidence well understood believe part due inoculation staphylococcal commensal flora wound site time surgery thereafter . The goal observational study develop well understanding pathogenesis epidemiology Staphylococcus aureus epidermidis-VAD infection well develop set criterion use help diagnose presence absence VAD related infection . This prospective , multi-center , observational study identify risk factor associate development VAD-related infection . Patients follow one year follow VAD implantation , time death transplantation , whichever come first . There randomization observational study .</detailed_description>
