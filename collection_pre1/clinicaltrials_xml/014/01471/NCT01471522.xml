	<brief_summary>The purpose ISCHEMIA trial determine best management strategy higher-risk patient stable ischemic heart disease . This multicenter randomize control trial target enrollment ~5000 patient least moderate ischemia stress image . Patients assigned random routine invasive strategy ( INV ) cardiac catheterization ( cath ) follow revascularization plus optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) conservative strategy ( CON ) OMT , cath revascularization reserve fail OMT . SPECIFIC AIMS A . Primary Aim The primary aim ISCHEMIA trial determine whether initial invasive strategy cardiac catheterization follow optimal revascularization , feasible , addition OMT , reduce primary composite endpoint cardiovascular death nonfatal myocardial infarction participant SIHD least moderate ischemia average follow-up approximately 4 year compare initial conservative strategy OMT alone catheterization reserve failure OMT . The primary endpoint time centrally adjudicate cardiovascular death nonfatal myocardial infarction . B . Secondary Aims Major : To compare angina-related quality life group . Other secondary aim include : ) compare incidence all-cause death ; component primary endpoint ; composite endpoint cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization unstable angina , resuscitate cardiac arrest , heart failure ; stroke ; stroke combine cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization unstable angina , resuscitate cardiac arrest , heart failure randomize group ; b ) compare health resource utilization , cost , cost-effectiveness group . Condition : Coronary Disease Procedure : Coronary CT Angiogram Procedure : Cardiac catheterization Phase : Phase III Condition : Cardiovascular Diseases Procedure : Angioplasty , Transluminal , Percutaneous Coronary , catheter-based intervention Phase : Phase III Condition : Heart Diseases Procedure : Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Phase : Phase III</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Evidence support routine invasive practice paradigm patient stable ischemic heart disease ( SIHD ) outdated . In strategy trial conduct 1970s , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) improve survival compare CABG SIHD patient high-risk anatomic feature . The relevance study today speculative contemporary secondary prevention—aspirin , beta-blockers , statin , ACE inhibitor , lifestyle interventions—were use minimally . Subsequent trial compare percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) medical therapy , PCI replace CABG dominant method revascularization SIHD . To date , PCI show reduce death myocardial infarction ( MI ) compare medical therapy SIHD patient . COURAGE BARI 2D , two large trial compare coronary revascularization vs. medical therapy SIHD patient , find among patient select basis coronary anatomy cath , initial management strategy coronary revascularization ( PCI , PCI CABG , respectively ) reduce primary endpoint death MI ( COURAGE ) , death ( BARI 2D ) compare OMT alone . These data suggest , prove , routine cath -- often lead ad hoc PCI diagnostic-therapeutic cascade -- may require SIHD patient . However , patient enrol COURAGE BARI 2D ischemia level document baseline mild moderate ischemia , leave open question appropriate role cath revascularization among high risk patient severe ischemia . Observational data suggest revascularization patient moderate-to-severe ischemia associate low mortality medical therapy alone , data establish cause effect relationship . In clinical practice half patient refer cath , indicate equipoise . Furthermore , analysis outcomes 468 COURAGE patient moderate-to-severe ischemia baseline reveal benefit PCI . This issue resolve use available data prior SIHD strategy trial enrol patient cath , introduce undefined selection bias ( e.g. , high risk patient enrol ) make translation study result problematic clinician manage patient yet cath . A clinical trial SIHD patient uniformly high risk ( could perform COURAGE BARI 2D result available ) need inform optimal management patient .
