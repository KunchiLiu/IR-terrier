	<brief_title>GSK2190915 Neutrophilic Asthma Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , two-way cross-over study evaluate effect treatment repeat dose GSK2190915 , 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein ( FLAP ) inhibitor , add-on current therapy percentage neutrophil induce sputum asthmatic patient elevate sputum neutrophil . Approximately 20 subject enrol onto study ensure approximately 14 evaluable subject complete study . All subject receive oral placebo GSK2190915 100mg daily 16 day . Sputum neutrophilia assess prior treatment treatment . Key assessment : sputum cell count , biomarker sample sputum , blood urine , pharmacokinetics . Safety assess vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , clinical laboratory safety test collection adverse event ( AEs ) . GSK2190915 high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein ( FLAP ) inhibitor attenuate production leukotrienes , blockage first committed step leukotriene pathway , 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) activation . Leukotrienes potent inflammatory molecule produce mainly mast cell , eosinophil , monocytes/macrophage neutrophil response allergic inflammatory stimulus . As GSK2190915 reproducibly inhibit production leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) cysteinyl leukotrienes ( cysLTs ) vitro vivo strong potential utility treatment asthma .</detailed_description>
