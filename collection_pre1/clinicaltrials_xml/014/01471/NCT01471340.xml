	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety DULERA . DULERA pressurize metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) contain two drug combine , namely mometasone formoterol single inhaler . Mometasone inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , reduce inflammation airway . Formoterol long-acting beta 2 agonist ( LABA ) , help relax muscle airways lung , make easy breathe . In combination , mometasone formoterol use treatment asthma . This study evaluate whether participant take LABA combination ICS single inhaler different risk serious asthma event ( hospitalization , intubation death ) compare participant take ICS alone .</brief_summary>
