	<brief_summary>Temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMD ) common musculoskeletal problem estimate 40-75 percent population report least one sign . Up fifteen percent patient seek care one condition , go develop chronic pain . The two common TMD condition include myofascial pain disorder internal derangement Temporomandibular Joint ( TMJ ) . These two condition similar clinical presentation , make accurate diagnosis difficult . Currently , accurate exam test differentiate two condition . Internal derangement TMJ condition disk displacement , pain , dysfunction , may progress localized osteoarthritis . Fortunately , condition self-limiting majority patient afflict , small minority progress advance joint destruction , disability chronic pain.18 Currently prognostic indicator identify individual . There three hypothesis degenerative TMJ disease , include : direct mechanical trauma , hypoxia reperfusion injury , neurogenic inflammation . All involve parafunctional habit clench grind patient low-grade inflammatory response/synovitis . 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18-FDG ) , radioisotope use positron emission tomography ( PET ) pair CT scan ( PET/CT ) , may role image inflammation arthritis recently demonstrate several pilot study involve osteoarthritis knee shoulder . 18-FDG accumulates area increase metabolism , particularly activate leukocyte , measure increase standardized uptake value.2 PET/CT offer unique advantage show active disease anatomic damage evident . Our hypothesis increase uptake 18-FDG PET/CT synovitis TMJ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use PET/CT Evaluate Synovitis Temporomandibular Joint ( TMJ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , double-blinded , pilot study evaluate ability PET/CT FDG detect synovitis temporomandibular joint . Patients present Department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Hospital University Pennsylvania symptomatic internal derangement temporomandibular joint require arthroscopy compare control subject . Key inclusion criterion include individual find primary diagnosis internal derangement temporomandibular joint require arthroscopy determine treat physician . All patient fail trial period `` conservative treatment therapy '' include occlusal splint therapy , NSAIDs , muscle relaxant period less eight week . Exclusion criterion include patient medically stable undergo arthroscopy general anesthesia , patient overlie infection skin , patient condition internal derangement cause temporomandibular pain dysfunction . Once patient identify eligible study , treat physician contact member study team . Each participate patient undergo standardize exam , research diagnostic criterion TMD ( RDC/TMD ) . A member research team , department oral medicine , administer exam . This standardized exam previously validate literature , member research team undergo train calibration prior administer RDC/TMD . This exam perform day arthroscopy . In addition , patient give Wilkes score , base Wilkes classification internal derangement.36 The patient undergo arthroscopy temporomandibular joint per treat physician . TMJ arthroscopy include : small incision front ear , introduction arthroscope irrigation needle joint space , irrigation fluid , discretion treat physician may include lysis adhesion introduction medication joint . At time procedure , synovitis score determine base eleven point synovitis scale describe Murakami , zero absence synovial inflammation . This score bone observation , typically include arthroscopy procedure diagnosis . The patient also give binomial score presence absence synovitis . A representative photograph obtain patient 's joint arthroscopy , routinely do procedure . Prior procedure , patient undergo PET/CT scan evaluate TMJ . This radiographic exam limit head neck region order minimize radiation exposure . The radiologist read study blind result clinical exam condition . The result PET/CT study give binomial score positive negative give continuous score base uptake relative unaffected joint . Control subject undergo RDC/TMD standardize exam prior radiographic study , PET/CT perform , subsequent intervention . These patient age matched treatment subject . This information utilized determine utility PET/CT detection synovitis temporomandibular joint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criterion include individual find primary diagnosis internal derangement temporomandibular joint require arthroscopy determine treat physician . All patient fail trial period `` conservative treatment therapy '' include occlusal splint therapy , NSAIDs , muscle relaxant period less eight week , per standard care . All patient age 18 70 . Exclusion criterion include patient medically stable undergo arthroscopy general anesthesia , patient overlie infection skin , uncontrolled diabetes , patient bilateral TMJ internal derangement , pregnancy , patient condition internal derangement cause temporomandibular pain dysfunction . Patients less 18 great 70 year age also exclude .</criteria>
