	<brief_summary>In several national anaesthesia society , clear fluid allow 2 hour general anaesthesia ( GA ) light meal 6h . Because aspiration risk , strict fasting remain routine . Recently , surgical study prove pre-operative carbohydrate-rich drink reduces preoperative discomfort without affect gastric fluid volume acidity.The aim study show effect preanaesthetic oral fluid patient undergo upper endoscopy without emergency . The expected efficacy reduction preoperative discomfort . The investigator thus propose randomised prospective open-label study assess efficacy preanaesthetic oral glucose drink patient undergo upper endoscopy without emergency . Study compare two group : group `` drink '' ( 200 ml fruit juice without pulp ± 200 ml coffee tea , 2 4 hour induction anaesthesia ) group `` overnight fasting '' .Discomfort measure 2 hour GA ( H-2 ) , GA ( H0 ) 4h anaesthesia ( H+4 ) . Each item ( anxiety , thirst , hunger , nervousness , tiredness , nausea ) estimate visual analogue scale ( VAS 0 100mm ) handgrip strength dynamometer . Gastroenterologist assess quality endoscopy ( VAS ) , gastric residual fluid acidity.The main aim study ass patient refer upper endoscopy general anaesthesia , effect carbohydrate drink preanaesthetic discomfort . Secondary purpose compare quality endoscopy , residual gastric volume , gastric acidity incidence side effect . 118 patient include study . A stratification make type endoscopy .</brief_summary>
