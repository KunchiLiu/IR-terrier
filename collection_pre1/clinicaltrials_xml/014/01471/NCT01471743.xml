	<brief_summary>Surgical patient high risk post operative infection . These post operative infection contribute increase length hospital stay , hospital cost delay overall recovery time thus decrease quality life . Studies report post operative complication range 37 % 74 % .1 The costly complication include infectious complication major Gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery include wound infection , abdominal abscess , pneumonia , sepsis anastomic leaks.2 Several study conduct show significant reduction infectious complication average length stay treat immunonutrition supplements.2-3 A review similarly design study different patient population indicate post-operative infection reduce average 71 % immunonutrition . This study seek investigate effect Impact Advanced Recovery 速 improve surgical outcome patient receive major gastrointestinal surgery compare standard supplement James A. Haley Veterans ' Hospital . Providing Impact Advanced Recovery 速 may decrease post-operative infectious complication , length stay , recovery time . Hypothesis 1 . In patient receive elective gastrointestinal surgery ( esophageal , gastric , pancreatic colon resection ) significant decrease least 60 % post-operative infection list patient consume 15 serving Impact Advanced Recovery速 pre-operatively compare patient consume 15 serving standard supplement . Complications consider : anastomatic leak , post-op wound development , post-op abdominal abscess , sepsis , pneumonia , post-op ileus , intestinal fistula , obstruction , urinary tract infection , peritonitis bowel necrosis . 2 . In patient receive elective gastrointestinal surgery ( esophageal , gastric , pancreatic colon resection ) significant decrease hospital NPO day patient consume 15 serving Impact Advanced Recovery 速 pre-operatively .</brief_summary>
