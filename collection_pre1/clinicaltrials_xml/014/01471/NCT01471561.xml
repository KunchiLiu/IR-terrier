	<detailed_description>The objective study determine tear osmolarity good predictor dry eye follow cataract surgery . The practice retrospectively identify patient cataract surgery billing record . This cross reference patient diagnosis dry eye tear osmolarity testing , also bill electronic record analysis . The study do sit inclusion general statement record review research patient intake information practice . Information take baseline visit final pre-operative examination prior cataract surgery patient tear osmolarity measure eye use TearLab osmolarity device . Because retrospective study , patient follow surgeon 's typical pre-operative post-operative protocol ( i.e. , lid cleansing , topical antibiotic , steroid , NSAIDS , etc . ) without peri-surgical complication , follow normal post-operative follow-up appointment . Whenever tear osmolarity measurement take record patient 's chart , information collect patient 's chart record database . Information visit include 3 month postoperative interval record . Additional information record demographic information age , correct vision cataract surgery one month visit well time tear osmolarity measure . Additionally , comment make history present illness statement regard dryness record database . Presence ocular surface disease present blepharitis , allergic disease , anterior basement membrane dystrophy record . Systemic medication patient take also record . Presence absence diabetes mellitus also record . The database keep password protect computer lock office location , every precaution take prevent identification patient specific identifier . Information de-identified soon possible use code identify data rather patient name chart number .</detailed_description>
