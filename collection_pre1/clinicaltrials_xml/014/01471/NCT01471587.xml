	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle compose two fibre type intertwine . Skeletal muscle weakness , particularly walk muscle , important complication Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) far investigator know mechanism drive process . All exist study investigate signal pathway whole muscle force consider type I type II fibres together . It possible disease selectively affect one fibre type , likely type I fibres fact lose COPD patient . For reason mechanism disease may overlook current study . The applicant acquire technology allow type I type II fibre muscle specimen split ( laser capture microdissection ) signalling pathway assess separately type II type I fibres proposal set . The proposal therefore aim capture well characterised clinical data 60 COPD patient 20 age match control , biopsy main walking muscle , quadriceps , take . In sample investigator assess fibre specific level inflammatory signal . Surplus material retained subsequent fibre specific analysis .</brief_summary>
