	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) poorly understood effective therapy develop . Recent study suggest precede viral infection cause mitochondrial dysfunction brain skeletal muscle genetically susceptible individual . There specific laboratory test identify patient CFS . However , certain clinical manifestation similar see mitochondrial disorder . Both patient mitochondrial disorder CFS manifest elevate serum lactate level exercise , demonstrate elevate brain cerebrospinal fluid level decrease brain glutathione level nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . Therapy consist daily condition exercise , dietary recommendation , nutraceutical supplement ( ENT ) show beneficial treating patient mitochondrial disorder . Similar therapy institute individual patient CFS show also improve clinical condition . A placebo-controlled trial undertaken 24 CFS patient age 25-55 . Patients fulfil CDC criterion CFS participate 6 month study . Other medical cause fatigue exclude . Half patient receive treatment consist daily conditioning exercise plus nutraceutical supplement ( ENT ) , show beneficial patient mitochondrial dysfunction , half receive daily conditioning exercise placebo tablet . Response ENT evaluate maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) circulate lactate level &amp; treadmill exercise , 6-minute walk test , fatigue questionnaire . In addition , whether ENT corrects elevate brain cerebrospinal fluid level decrease brain glutathione level measure . To ensure compliance therapy patient monitor frequently . The objective study ass safety efficacy ENT whether ENT lead sustain improvement CFS patient compare baseline status , compare exercise group patient receive supplement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , also know myalgic encephalitis ( ME ) , clinically characterized multisystem illness exhibit debilitate fatigue , musculoskeletal pain , disturbed sleep , impaired memory concentration . Its diagnosis non-specific symptom base , real biomarkers yet identify . The etiology pathophysiology CFS remain obscure . There long-standing hypothesis individual CFS normal metabolism fatigue psychological , energy waste process anxiety , stress , depression . The CFS investigate , however , clear becomes incorrect , probably metabolic dysfunction result insufficient energy production . A number study suggest may genetic contribution CFS . In addition , severe viral illness frequently predispose onset CFS , number pathogen link CFS ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) . Although patient develop CFS acute infection mononucleosis , investigator believe arise reactivation latent virus host , result chronic low-level activation immune system . As data acquire , others believe CFS actually metabolic mitochondrial dysfunction result insufficient energy production . Mounting evidence indicate viral infection genetically susceptible individual cause change mitochondrial function . Many feature observe CFS similar see genetic mitochondrial disorder . Firstly , muscle biopsy patient CFS show abnormal mitochondrial degeneration severe deletion mitochondrial DNA gene . Mitochondrial dysfunction increase production free radical reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , cause oxidative damage , believe contribute CFS pathogenesis . Carnitine require metabolic reaction include mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation . A deficiency serum acylcarnitine observe CFS patient , suggest increase utilization carnitine CFS , thereby decrease energy production . In mitochondrial disorder , utilization pyruvate decrease , result high circulate muscle level lactate , well decrease oxidative phosphorylation energy production . Brain ventricular cerebrospinal lactate elevate , brain glutathione decrease , mitochondrial disorder CFS . In CFS patient cerebrospinal lactate increase approximately 300 % compare find generalize anxiety disorder healthy individual . Using brain NMR spectroscopy , distinction CFS psychological disorder demonstrate .</detailed_description>
