	<brief_title>Phase II Short-term Adjuvant Therapy Biomarker Studies With Targeted Agents Women With Estrogen Receptor Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 3 study group : - If Group 1 , take dasatinib 40mg day mouth water . - If Group 2 , take dasatinib 80mg day mouth water . - If Group 3 , receive dasatinib . You give study drug diary complete . In diary , record take study drug . Study Visits : At Month 1 : - You call nurse ask drug take side effect may . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your drug diary review . At Month 2 call nurse ask drug take side effect may . You also ask review drug diary . This call take 20 minute At Month 3 ( leave study early ) : - You fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) breast biomarker test . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your drug diary review . Length Study : You may remain study 3 month . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment leukemia . Its use breast cancer patient investigational . Up 66 patient take part multicenter study . Up 60 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
