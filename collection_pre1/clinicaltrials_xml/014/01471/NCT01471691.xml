	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study Age &gt; 18 year CRVO BRVO diagnosis For CRVO , clinical evidence perfuse central retinal vein occlusion . A CRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage dilate retinal venous system 4 quadrant . Other evidence CRVO may include telangiectatic capillary bed collateral vessel optic nerve head . Central macular edema present clinical examination OCT test central point thickness and/or central 1mm subfield thickness &gt; 300 micron least 3 month bevacizumab steroid therapy . Visual acuity score great equal 19 letter ( 20/400 ) less equal 73 letter ( 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol . Patients must demonstrate longer improve bevacizumab intravitreal steroid therapy ( i.e . improvement acuity 2 consecutive visit ) BRVO patient treat grid laser must show residual edema three month follow late laser treatment Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient allow OCT test retinal photography Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) know pregnant ; also premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . Participation another ocular investigation trial simultaneously Any condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g . chronic alcoholism , drug abuse ) Significant diabetic retinopathy ( great moderate NPDR ) macular edema associate diabetic retinopathy An eye , investigator 's opinion , chance improve visual acuity follow resolution macular edema ( e.g . presence subretinal fibrosis geographic atrophy severe epiretinal membrane ) Presence another ocular condition may affect visual acuity macular edema course study ( e.g . AMD , uveitis , IrvineGas ) Evidence neovascularization iris retina ( presence ischemic CRVO/BRVO ) Evidence central atrophy fibrosis study eye Presence substantial cataract , one might decrease vision 3 line vision sometime study . History grid/focal laser panretinal laser study eye previous three month History vitreous surgery study eye History use intravitreal , peribulbar , retrobulbar steroid within three month study . History cataract surgery within 6 month enrollment . History YAG capsulotomy within 2 month surgery . Visual acuity &lt; 20/400 fellow eye Uncontrolled glaucoma ( pressure &gt; 30 ) despite treatment glaucoma medication . History cerebral vascular accident myocardial infarction within 3 month prior Day 0 .</criteria>
