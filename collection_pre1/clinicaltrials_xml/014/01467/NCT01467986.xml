	<brief_summary>Children , adolescents young adult high risk relapse treatment refractory neuroblastoma ( rNB ) represent group patient dismal prognosis recommend standard salvage therapy currently available . The multimodal metronomic approach combine molecular target drug ( rapamycin dasatinib ) conventional chemotherapy ( irinotecan temozolomide ) investigate randomized fashion new treatment strategy patient rNB . The intention ass therapeutic benefit molecular target drug treatment rNB . The combination irinotecan temozolomide show activity treatment several solid organ tumor , brain tumor neuroblastoma . In one study rNB patient receive median 5 course 5 day irinotecan temozolomide every 3 4 week cumulative dose 35 % low RIST design . 33 % disease regression 8 % CR PR . A phase II study rNB also use irinotecan temozolomide substantially low intensity show response rate 15 % . The combination mTOR inhibitor multi-kinase inhibitor demonstrate preclinical study synergistic effect cell cycle arrest , apoptosis sensitization radio- chemotherapy . It assume combination molecular target drug tolerable conventional chemotherapy consist irinotecan temozolomide substantially improve outcome patient population . A group 20 rNB patient treated RIST therapy approach compassionate use setting show overall survival 55 % median 80 week tolerable adverse event profile .</brief_summary>
