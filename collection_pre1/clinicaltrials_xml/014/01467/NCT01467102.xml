	<brief_summary>This project European observational study incidence characteristic chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) . Research Questions - What incidence chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) Europe ? - What risk factor chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) relate surgery , patient anaesthesia management ? - What difference incidence risk factor different European country ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>euCPSP : European Observational Study Chronic Post Surgical Pain , PAIN-OUT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal study obtain generalizable epidemiology chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) perform large data collection many European country . The large sample allow analysis incidence CPSP , differences incidence pattern Europe , incidence rare type surgery specific population . This observational , prospective study help well anticipate potentially prevent development chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) . In fact CPSP occur patient frequently undiagnosed pain poorly manage patient may develop refractory chronic pain . Surgery major cause chronic pain unique potential prevent occur . Data study might alert respectively surgeon anesthetist important type surgery perioperative technique pain prevention impact incidence chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) . Anesthesiologists , lead project , might therefore , important role prevent future case chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) . Sample size calculation : The investigator expect least 30 site able participate recruit 200 patient year , maximum 6,000 patient , one year study period . Since mean incidence CPSP approximately 30 % , offer estimate potential number 2000 patient CPSP . Organisation : Investigators use questionnaire English , German , French , Spanish , Italian , Romanian , Swedish , Hebrew , Dutch Russian . They supervise data collection , ensure timely data return act guarantor integrity quality data collect . The Chief investigator , Professor Fletcher member PAIN OUT group closely work new group investigator participate project CPSP . His experience European PAIN OUT project valuable organize coordinate study . The European Society Anaesthesiology ( ESA ) support project help administrative coordination build European network . Time scale : The study last two half year one year recruitment , one year follow 6 month analysis . Statistical Analysis : Incidence chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) 12 month type surgery analyze expressed mean confidence interval 95 % . The investigator compare incidence various type surgery , different centre country . Risk factor chronic post surgical pain ( CPSP ) analyze use univariate multivariate analysis . The predictive factor choose fit logistic regression model use forward selection procedure . By combine data different centre , investigator determine significant risk factor .</detailed_description>
