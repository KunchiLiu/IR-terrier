	<brief_summary>This randomize control trial ( RCT ) use Inhaled prostaglandin E1 ( IPGE1 ) Neonatal Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure ( NHRF ) . Fifty patient recruit 10 high volume site within NICHD Neonatal Research Network constitute pilot sample evaluate feasibility safety prolong IPGE1 administration determination optimal dose . In Pilot RCT , two dos IPGE1 ( 300 150 ng/kg/min ) administer maximum duration 72 hour compare placebo . Once feasibility safety IPGE1 administer 72 hour demonstrate pilot trial , full scale randomize control trial plan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Prostaglandin E1 ( IPGE1 ) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure ( NHRF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxemic respiratory failure newborn ( NHRF ) usually associate widespread vasoconstriction pulmonary microvasculature give rise intra- extra-pulmonary shunt profound hypoxemia . The goal therapy decrease regional pulmonary vascular resistance ventilate lung area thus decrease intrapulmonary shunt selectively reduce pulmonary-artery pressure without cause systemic vasodilation . Intravenously administer vasodilator lack pulmonary selectivity lead systemic side effect . Inhaled nitric oxide ( INO ) , selective pulmonary vasodilator , revolutionize treatment respiratory failure newborn . However , lack sustain improvement 30-46 % infant ; moreover , INO require specialized system administration , make treatment expensive . Aerosolized prostaglandins I2 E1 report effective selective pulmonary vasodilator animal human adult . In addition , inhale prostaglandin I2 ( IPGI2 ) also report effective preterm term newborn , child pulmonary hypertension . Although intravenous PGE1 widely use neonate , use inhaled form report newborns pulmonary hypertension . Compared PGI2 , PGE1 short half-life , low acidity constant ( pKa ) ( 6.3 versus 10.5 ) , bronchodilator action , anti-proliferative anti-inflammatory effect alveolar , interstitial vascular space lung . Prostaglandin nebulization use without sophisticated technical equipment need control NO inhalation hence less expensive . It known toxic metabolite toxic effect . Prostaglandins nitric oxide ( NO ) relax vascular smooth muscle two different second-messenger system ; therefore , combination , INO IPGE1 may synergistic effect . The exist literature suggest inhale PGE1 potential effective vasodilator treatment NHRF . We report safety feasibility short-term administration inhale PGE1 un-blinded Phase I/II dose-escalation study . Four dos range 25 300 ng/kg/min test maximum duration 3 hour . We also report stability IPGE1 , emit dose aerosol particle size distribution ( APSD ) neonatal ventilator circuit . In addition demonstrate safety high dose IPGE1 ( 1200 ng/kg/min ) 24 hour ventilate piglet . In current protocol , propose pilot evaluate feasibility safety prolong IPGE1 NHRF . Two dos IPGE1 ( 300 150 ng/kg/min ) test follow wean maximum duration 72 hour determine feasibility , safety , optimal dose duration therapy 50 patient ten NICHD NRN sit . An IND status approve FDA trial .</detailed_description>
