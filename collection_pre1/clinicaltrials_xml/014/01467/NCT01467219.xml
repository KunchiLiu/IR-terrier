	<brief_summary>The surgical management high-risk endometrial cancer often involve extensive operation remove lymph node sit possible cancer spread . 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging increasingly use identify site cancer spread recently group use intra-operative gamma probe well localize metastatic disease . In pilot study , patient newly diagnose early stage , high-risk endometrial cancer undergo primary surgery pre-operative PET scan intra-operative localization metastatic lymph node use gamma probe . A complete lymphadenectomy follow ability detect positive lymph node PET scan intra-operative probe calculate . This study address feasibility FDG detection gamma probe addition pre-operative PET/CT lymphatic mapping woman clinical early stage high risk endometrial cancer . The study also evaluate role identify metastatic lymph node intraoperatively would otherwise clinically negative .</brief_summary>
