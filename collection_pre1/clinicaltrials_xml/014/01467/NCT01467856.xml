	<brief_summary>Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) occur 2 % 4 % non-disabled adult population characterize period complete breathe cessation ( apnea ) mark reduction airflow ( hypopnea ) sleep . By contrast , diagnosis SDB affect many 83 % person tetraplegia within one year injury . While consider daytime somnolescence poor sleep quality 'tolerable annoyance ' , SDB decrease near-term physical performance mental alertness , decay memory intellectual processing , invoke mood disturbance , decrease healthrelated quality life ( HRQoL ) , cause vehicular occupational injury . Recurrent sleep arousal strongly associate cardiometabolic ( CM ) component risk include insulin resistance , obesity , inflammatory stress , endothelial dysfunction . Despite considerable advancement understand treat SDB - include favor use positive airway pressure ( PAP ) - evidence base sufficient warrant routine evaluation treatment SDB relate sleep disorder remain elusive spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . To address knowledge treatment shortcoming investigator conduct hypothesis-driven study specific aim : 1 ) describe stakeholder survey clinically-relevant determinant sleep quality person chronic tetraplegia , 2 ) ass clinical feature co-morbid risk associate SDB person tetraplegia , 3 ) determine person tetraplegia SDB whether treatment use PAP reduce health risk improve HRQoL . Hypothesis 1 test use data derive website survey .</brief_summary>
