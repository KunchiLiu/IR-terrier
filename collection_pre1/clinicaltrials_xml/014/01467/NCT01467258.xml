	<brief_summary>Amantadine appear specific substrate acetylation spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase ( SSAT ) . SSAT activity cancer cell higher several-fold compare normal cell . Amantadine use determine SSAT cellular activity , may indicate presence cancer . This study provide additional information conjunction data previous study include cancer patient normal health age match control determine whether urinary excretion acetylamantadine predictive presence cancer , whether excretion metabolite associate particular site tumor . Based result first study additional data normal healthy volunteer require . The data study analyze account subject gender , stage disease time test , concurrent disease , alcohol tobacco use occupational characteristic . This important first step validate cancer detection method implement economically screen large number people site remote limited expensive diagnostic instrumentation . Thus possibility design prognosis biomarker well positive/negative indicator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Excretion Acetylamantadine Normal Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A group 20 female 20 male normal healthy volunteer age 18 69 recruit community use general advertisement place initially poster . We tell volunteer conduct study healthy volunteer determine amantadine eliminate body . We explain pharmacology amantadine potential side effect single dose obtain consent . Volunteers tell potential concurrent alcohol ingestion result presence acetylamantadine urine . Volunteers require abstain alcohol consumption least one day prior include time involve amantadine ingestion urine collection . Any previous adverse reaction amantadine exclude person volunteer study . Subjects informed side effect drug ingestion highly unlikely single dose administer . Any side effect occur related effect amantadine brain . These effect may include insomnia , jitteriness , difficulty concentrate mental depression . However , side effect associate chronic ingestion amantadine highly unlikely occur ingestion single dose . Once consent obtain , volunteer ingest therapeutic dose amantadine ( 200 mg ) morning , least 2 hour breakfast , complete urine collect period 12 hour post dose . A previous clinical study laboratory collection urine total 8 hour demonstrate collection time sufficient collect metabolically produce acetylamantadine urine . The urine sample also analyze content creatinine indication completeness urine collection . The urine label code frozen -20Â°C analyze . The urine analyzed acetylamantidine establish gas chromatography method . The technician analyzing sample access participant information code label . Saliva specimens also collect 2 hour interval amantadine ingestion . It note morning dose amantadine collection multiple saliva sample simplify allow determination optimal time dose urine analysis . Furthermore , design identify window opportunity give best signal noise ratio acetylamantidine production . Blood sample collect 1 hour prior dose 2 hour post dose . We also collect follow data volunteer : name , age , sex , body weight , height , concurrent medication use , recent history alcohol ingestion . These data use correlation analysis determine relationship urinary acetylamantidine particular cancer diagnosis , sex , and/or history alcohol consumption . All data cod principal investigator , individually identify information lock secure cabinet . Access data principal investigator and/or attend physician allow . Exclusion criteria anyone history previous adverse reaction amantadine well pregnant lactate female exclude volunteer study . Cross validation find occur high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) urine sample presence polyamines metabolite , include N1-acetylspermidine .</detailed_description>
