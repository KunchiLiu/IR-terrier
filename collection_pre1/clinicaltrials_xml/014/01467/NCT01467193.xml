	<brief_summary>This study aim assess effect standardize dietary fat load short-term aerobic exercise systemic lipolysis , flexibility partition ectopic fat store ( intramyocellular = IMCL , intrahepatocellular = IHCL , intramyocardial lipid = IMCaL ) relation FFA endurance train athlete hypopituitary patient compare sedentary healthy control subject . Exercise powerful stimulation growth hormone ( GH ) secretion health . A standardised exercise test , therefore , discriminative diagnosis GH-deficiency adult . This assessed . Hypothesis ( ectopic fat store ) 1 . Ectopic fat store flexible fuel store influence diet physical activity.FFA availability may play important regulatory role . 2 . There tissue specific partition triglyceride and/or FFA among non-adipose organ fat load physical exercise 3 . The flexibility ectopic fat store related insulin sensitivity 4 . Lipolytic anti-lipolytic hormone critical regulating FFA availability ( rest exercise ) therefore also regulation ectopic fat store . 5 . GH lipolytica hormone . Lack GH adulthood relate decreased FFA availability thereby influence ectopic lipid store Hypothesis diagnosis GHD 6 . A short intensive physical exercise show good discriminative power diagnose GHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Obesity , particular visceral obesity , associate impaired insulin action target tissue ( insulin resistance metabolic syndrome ) , turn , relate increase risk cardiovascular mortality morbidity . Pathophysiological mechanism remain unclear . Interventions patient impair glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose consistently demonstrate increase physical activity reduce calorie intake risk convert frank type 2 diabetes decrease , even efficiently early medical therapy metformin . Physically inactive overweight subject store excess fat intra-abdominal subcutaneous department also non-adipose tissue ( = '' ectopic '' tissue ) , also skeletal muscle , liver myocardium , also call intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) , intrahepatocellular lipid ( IHCL ) intramyocardial lipid ( IMCaL ) .This ectopic lipid accumulation occur either increase free fatty acid ( FFA ) uptake , increase synthesis involve tissue reduce FFA oxidation . The relative contribution factor ectopic lipid accumulation varies different physiological condition ( i.e . physical exercise , fasting , postprandial condition ) different tissue . In addition , may influence hormone regulate lipid metabolism . There increase evidence ectopic fat intermediate metabolite interfere insulin signalling , thereby contribute impaired insulin action target tissue liver skeletal muscle . It well show high fat oxydation capacity allow keep low lipolytic activity therefore low level lipolyse degradation product . Strong evidence accumulate intermediate interact insulin signal finally result insulin resistance . There still scarce data behaviour ectopic fat store presence positive ( nutritional fat excess ) negative energy balance ( physical activity ) role hormone regulate fat depot . Additionally , previously show GH value obtain 2h standardized aerobic exercise moderate intensity reveal high diagnostic accuracy predict severe GHD adult individual . Whether shorter exercise high intensity may lead comparable result assess . Objective The study aim comprehensively assess flexibility partition ectopic fat deposition define role relevant hormone ( especially GH insulin ) relation availability FFAs well role process ectopic fat deposition consumption . Another objective investigate role standardize fat load aerobic exercise IMCaL . Methods Using two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity assess . Lipid depot ( skeletal muscle liver ) repeatedly measure MR-spectroscopy , subcutaneous visceral fat mass whole body MR-imaging . Exercise capacity ist measure bicycle ( incl . spiroergometry ) . Counterregulatory hormone , glucose free fatty acid measure 2h physical exercise 50-60 VO2max . Blood sample evaluate GH take immediately Vo2 max-test , well 15 , 30 45minutes end exercise test .</detailed_description>
