	<detailed_description>In study investigator want look activity kinases particular experimental drug call GSK1120212 administer . GSK1120212 block kinase call MEK . GSK1120212 yet approve FDA use breast cancer patient . The investigator want give subject GSK1120212 short period time ( one week ) see MEK kinase function cancer cell study drug give . The investigator give drug research purpose . The length time give intended treat cancer . Research treatments breast cancer rely understand cell tumor tissue act expose new different drug . To find new different drug treat cancer , researcher look protein help cancer cell grow , group protein call Kinases . This important many new cancer drug design block kinase cause cancer cell die tumor shrink . However , block one kinase time often less effective investigator expect block one kinase another take place . For reason , investigator may need treat breast cancer one kinase-blocking drug time . However , investigator n't yet know best combination drug , hard measure possible kinase . Previous study able identify le 10 % hundred kinases cancer cell . Recently researcher UNC develop process identify may ( half ) kinases . This tell u kinase need blocked time make tumor shrink investigator design best combination kinase block drug triple negative breast cancer . This especially important individual triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) few drug available block molecule affect tumor growth . The investigator believe kinase-blocking drug potential effective treatment people TNBC .</detailed_description>
