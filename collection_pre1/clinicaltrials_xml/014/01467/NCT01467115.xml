	<brief_summary>More 50 % Head Neck cancer locally advanced presentation . Although surgery , combination modality like radiation therapy achieve 40-50 % five year survival rate , resection head neck region leave patient poor functional cosmetic outcome . Due concern quality life surgery , lot interest non surgical alternative treatment . Various combination radiation , chemotherapy biologics show promising result . However , question still remain ideal combination treatment regimen . Based assimilation data multiple source , study try identify role potentially highly effective multi-modality regimen base induction chemotherapy ( Cisplatin , Docetaxel 5 Fluorouracil ) follow combination biologic agent , Cetuximab , radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY FOLLOWED BY CETUXIMAB AND RADIATION THERAPY FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients give two cycle induction chemotherapy Cisplatin , Docetaxel Fluorouracil . This follow six week radiation therapy along Cetuximab . Patients get two cycle chemotherapy agent completion radiation therapy course . Patients watch closely trial period , close follow treatment response monitor adverse effect .</detailed_description>
