Data analyze Multivariate analysis repeat measure . Ancillary test investigate effect intervention whole body oxidation fat rest follow food intake , examine relationship dietary intake caloric expenditure begin end 18 month study . The primary trial goal pay fidelity DPP target sustained loss 7 % body weight , proven countermeasure prevention diabetes . Positive result train represent first evidence-based randomize multi-center trial sustain weight loss person SCI - military civilian . In near term data provide evidence need initiate health reform military non-military constituency disability . The information also underwrite change dietary support newly injure person . The information provide roadmap clinician institute client-centered program health planning recovery . As extension phase test home community-based program , deployment wider military constituency person SCI achieve VA Community Outpatient Clinics .
