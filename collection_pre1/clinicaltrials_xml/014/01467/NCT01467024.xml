	<brief_title>Evaluation MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This retrospective study design assess validity reproducibility MP Diagnostics IVD device , HTLV Blot 2.4 ( MP Blot ) , various population . The study conduct three geographical distinct location . The validity MP Blot assess calculate follow : 1 . Percent negative agreement CDPHL Algorithm 200 EIA negative specimen 2 . Percent positive agreement CDPHL Algorithm 200 EIA repeat reactive specimens The sensitivity MP Blot evaluate test 200 know positive specimen . The study perform use three product lot three clinical site . The reproducibility MP Blot assess test two replicates three member panel three clinical test site three lot product multiple day three operator .</detailed_description>
