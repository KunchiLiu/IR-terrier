	<brief_title>Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Women Through Tai Chi Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States . Historically , CVD diagnose inadequately treated woman relate issue gender bias , lack public medical awareness prevalence , unique present symptomatology . Despite increase awareness , well well diagnostics treatment , woman still likely men present advanced disease experience high CVD-related morbidity mortality . Given fact , prevention CVD critical . Cardiometabolic risk ( CMR ) relatively new term set risk factor , view together , indicator overall risk develop CVD . CMR useful assessing , modifying , ultimately prevent development CVD . Prevention CVD woman may best achieve early identification treatment evolve CMR . Central abdominal obesity , reflect presence visceral adipose tissue evidence increased waist circumference , show significant predictor CVD . In PNI-based model CMR fatigue , abdominal adiposity fatigue product allostatic load . Resulting cumulative wear tear , fatigue give rise dysregulation metabolic process , ultimately result subjective symptomatology disease risk . Additionally , fatigue often accompany metabolic change , potentiate trajectory CMR relate decreased physical activity self-care . Tai chi may enhance relaxation could potentially reduce CMR . The specific aim project refine tai chi intervention use wait-list pretest-posttest design repeat measure . Feasibility acceptability intervention identification potential indicator effectiveness also assess . Additionally , PNI-based model fatigue CMR refine . The first aim analyze use mixed effect model . The second specific aim , refine PNI-based model fatigue CMR , examine use descriptive statistic , graphical method pairwise correlation , second step , variable reduction method include factor analysis , principle component analysis canonical correlation analysis . The project base theoretically scientifically sound framework investigate comprehensive , sensitive , innovative model understanding , measuring , potentially reduce CMR woman . With study , goal line research reduce CMR perhaps reduce morbidity mortality relate CVD .</detailed_description>
