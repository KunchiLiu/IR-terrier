	<brief_title>Microparticles Risk Re-stenosis Following Balloon Angioplasty Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Background rationale study : Atherosclerosis increase widespread systemic disease , represent significant cause morbidity mortality affect . Age-adjusted prevalence peripheral arterial disease lie 12 % , increase 20 % person age 70 . Five percent patient intermittent claudication develop critical limb ischemia within five year early symptom , consider risk major amputation . Whilst bypass surgery remain valid treatment option patient peripheral arterial disease ensure good long-term anatomical patency clinical durability , trust surgical procedure come certain risk morbidity mortality . Furthermore , patent vessel good quality , particularly vein need bypass procedure , often unavailable impose limitation method . Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) evolve past year valid treatment modality patient stenotic arterial lesion low extremity due peripheral arterial disease . However , re-stenosis follow PTA peripheral arterial disease uncommon pose serious therapeutic problem . Despite increase prevalence incidence peripheral arterial disease population , timely diagnosis use diagnostic prognostic marker still lack ( still lag behind current diagnostic treatment strategy coronary artery disease acute coronary syndrome ) . Indeed , currently , recognisable risk factor development re-stenosis recognize . These include beside clinically advanced peripheral arterial disease diabetes mellitus , also pro-inflammatory pro-coagulatory state high CRP fibrinogen well post-interventionally increased level von Willebrand factor plasminogen inhibitor-1 . Furthermore , TGF-beta1 level also significantly increased patient re-stenosis . The actual missing link `` common '' pro-inflammatory marker occurrence re-stenosis however know - answer may lie subcellular fragment circulate blood . Indeed , so-called cell-derived plasma microparticles ( MPs ) small phospholipid vesicle 1.5 µm size release platelet , circulate leukocyte endothelial cell upon activation . Originating lipid raft , contain define bioactive molecule potentially implicated thrombogenesis trans-cellular activation . Additionally , pro-inflammatory function may mediate putative ligand-receptor interaction , classical pathway complement activation 11 trigger modify target cell function . Furthermore , MPs represent population phosphatidylserine-exposing sub-cellular fragment , function `` carrier '' circulate tissue factor , may invaluable maintain normal haemostasis platelet function impair . Microparticles transport pro-inflammatory molecule interleukin , interferon gamma tumour necrosis factor alpha . Increasing evidence suggests release MPs inert cell debris irrelevant platelet dust . Instead , potent biological agent find healthy individual also implicate variety disease , include vascular inflammatory state cardiopulmonary bypass surgery , acute coronary syndrome , disease associate metabolic syndrome e.g . diabetes mellitus . Patients peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) due diabetes mellitus type 2 also present increase `` baseline '' pro-inflammatory pro-coagulatory state . It appear diabetic patient platelet-derived microparticles may participate development progression atherosclerosis . Moreover , elevate number microparticles , specifically platelet-derived , described patient peripheral arterial disease . Although microparticles well-documented mediator inflammation coagulation various cardio-vascular disease event , currently know PTA peripheral arterial disease influence microparticle number , phenotype distribution pre- post interventionally related affect incidence early re-stenosis - indeed may use predict patient risk early re-stenosis . Objective Hypothesis Aims : Hypothesis : Plasma derive microparticles actively influence course disease associate early re-stenosis/re-occlusion angioplasty patient ( men woman ) peripheral arterial disease act mediator innate- cellular immunity well coagulation system . Aim 1 : The first aim study characterise quantify microparticles peripheral blood sample baseline one day post-angioplasty Aim 2 : The second aim characterise quantify microparticles follow period 2 week , 3 6 month post-angioplasty identify whether microparticle profile use define patient great risk re-stenosis . Aim 3 : The third aim address possible gender difference microparticle distribution number sub-group analysis . This important part project currently data exist . Methods Study design : The study include measurement baseline , one day , 2 week , 3 6 month post-angioplasty . Evaluation Obtain inform consent : day ( ) 0 Physical examination : d0 , d+1 , 2 week , 3 6 month post-intervention Ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) measurement : d0 , d+1 , 2 week , 3 6 month post-intervention Duplex sonography : 6 month post-intervention Angioplasty : d0 ( begin study Blood sample routine* : d0 , d+1 Blood sample study** : d0 , d+1 , 2 week , 3 6 month post-intervention * Fasting glucose , HBA1c , lipid profile , creatinine , haemoglobin , leukocyte profile , thrombocytes , C-reactive protein ** Microparticles , cytokine , complement ( =5ml serum , 2.7ml EDTA plasma , 10ml citrate )</detailed_description>
