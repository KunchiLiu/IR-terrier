	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn safety tolerability etravirine . Etravirine type non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) show high activity wild-type human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) , HIV strain resistant non-nucleotide agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Etravirine Administered Combination With Other Antiretroviral Agents Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , single arm , multicenter Phase IV study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics etravirine ( ETR ) combination antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy darunavir ( DRV ) + ritonavir ( rtv ) . In addition , antiviral activity pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile , safety ETR assess . The study consist screen period maximum 6 week , baseline visit , 48-week treatment period . After end treatment period , patient ongoing adverse event ( AEs ) follow additional 4 week . At least 200 ARV treatment-experienced human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) infect patient enrol study . Patients consider ARV treatment-experienced current stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimen least 8 week prior screen . The study population consist patient need change current HAART regimen due follow reason : ( 1 ) patient experience virologic failure ( screen viral load value &gt; =500 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL ) , ( 2 ) patient switch due simplification current regimen due AEs and/or tolerability reason ( screen viral load value &lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL ) . Patients receive ETR 200 mg twice daily combination investigator-selected background regimen . In addition ETR , need active base resistance testing , background regimen consist least 1 active ARV result treatment regimen least 2 active ARVs . The following exception : ( 1 ) raltegravir ( RAL ) atazanavir/ritonavir ( ATV/rtv ) part background regimen , number active ARVs background regimen least 2 ; ( 2 ) low-dose ritonavir count active ARV . DRV/rtv allow background regimen order evaluate safety pharmacokinetics ETR combination ARVs DRV/rtv . Furthermore , background regimen consist nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) allow . The background regimen modify end treatment period follow exception : switch within ARV class allow well documented tolerability/toxicity reason . For patient , opinion investigator , derive clinical benefit ETR , ETR commercially available his/her country , reimburse access another source ( e.g. , access program , government program ) region patient living , possibility extend ETR treatment period provide . The ETR tablet take orally twice daily meal . A total daily dose 400 mg take 48 week .</detailed_description>
