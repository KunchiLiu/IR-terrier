	<brief_title>Minocycline Plus Amiodarone Versus Amiodarone Alone Prevention Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , effective therapy prevent PAF cardiac surgery remain undetermined . Amiodarone administration consider decrease incidence new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) cardiac operation . However , PAF require anticoagulation therapy occur 40-50 % case early cardiac surgery despite amiodarone prophylaxis . PAF associate increased morbidity mortality include complication result long-term anticoagulation . The finding exaggerate inflammatory response manifest elevated acute oxidative stress protein , induction apoptotic mediator right atrial myocytes may responsible PAF , steroidal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy reduce PAF support mechanism possible etiological factor . Minocycline , tetracycline antibiotic , specific atrial myocyte anti-apoptotic effect decrease right atrial tissue inflammation , oxidative stress activity molecular index apoptosis . Apoptosis cardiac myocytes think one etiologic factor underlie postoperative atrial fibrillation . These observation lead trial hypothesis addition minocycline amiodarone may favorably affect suppression PAF . This randomize controlled trial compare efficacy safety treatment effect intravenous minocycline 100 mg daily x 5 day start intra-operatively combined oral amiodarone ( 400 mg twice daily 7 day , 200 mg twice daily next 7 day ) , versus dose oral amiodarone alone , prevention PAF among adult patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft , heart valve replacement/repair , combine procedure . All patient receive 150 mg intravenous amiodarone intraoperatively 2nd similar dose amiodarone bolus permit tachyarrhythmia time within 24 hour surgery . PAF detect telemetry hospitalization 2 week follow hospital discharge , 12-lead electrocardiogram . The primary outcome PAF occurrence . Secondary outcome include thromboembolic stroke , need pharmacologic electric cardioversion , mediastinal exploration anticoagulation-related bleeding , serious drug side effect , Clostridium difficile superinfection , length hospital stay 30-day mortality cardiovascular cause . Based projected PAF incidence 26 % assume 5 % dropout rate two-sided alpha 0.05 , design require 400 subject detect reduction 50 % primary outcome 90 % power . This valuable trial would affect method investigator practice .</detailed_description>
