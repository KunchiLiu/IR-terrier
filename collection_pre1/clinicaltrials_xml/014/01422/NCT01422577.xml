	<brief_summary>Early detection colo-rectal adenoma use colonoscopy prevent occurrence colon cancer . While colonoscopy standard technique , miss early cancer . To improve detection rate , Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) introduce 2006 . It show compare favorably chromo-endoscopy sensitivity specificity diagnosis malignant colo-rectal neoplasm . The major drawback NBI image become dark presence blood fecal matter . The bright-NBI prototype image technology enables endoscopists obtain good image suboptimal condition . The study propose compare performance colonoscopy use either white light bright NBI subject undergo screen colonoscopy search colon adenoma . Purpose To determine bright -NBI superior WLE detect colorectal adenomas average risk subject undergo screen colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Colonic Adenomas Bright Narrow Band Imaging ( B-NBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Removal colorectal adenoma prevents occurrence cancer [ 1 ] . It recognize colonoscopy miss colorectal adenomas early cancer [ 2 ] . There need improve performance colonoscopy . The use chromo-endoscopy show improve detection flat adenoma [ 3 ] . Narrow band imaging introduce year 2006 . It similar chromo-endoscopy provide mucosal detail . This enable endoscopists accurately describe pit pattern adenoma . NBI use substitute chromo-endoscopy . In pooled analysis , NBI comparable chromo-endoscopy sensitivity specificity diagnosis malignant colorectal adenoma [ 4 ] . Unfortunately , use NBI show conclusively improve rate colorectal adenoma detection . Two 3 randomized trial compare WLE NBI show high adenoma detection rate use NBI [ 5 , 6 ] . In study Rex et al. , rate however similar either modality . In pooled analysis , NBI marginally well WLE [ 4 ] . The effective use NBI depend quality bowel preparation experience endoscopist . In presence fecal matter , NBI tend dark detection small adenoma become difficult . The prototype bright NBI couple high definition resolution likely overcome drawback original NBI .</detailed_description>
