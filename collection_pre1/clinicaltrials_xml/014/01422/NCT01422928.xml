	<brief_summary>Purpose/Goal : To investigate long course radiation therapy ( RT ) , without chemotherapy , affect immune system , determine acupuncture modify effect patient undergo curative radiation therapy gastrointestinal ( GI ) genitourinary ( GU ) cancer . Clinical Research Questions : 1 . Does RT reduce immune biomarkers treat subject ? 2 . Which biomarkers affect treatment ? 3 . Is acupuncture feasible option help ameliorate biomarker effect ? 4 . Does RT affect subject symptom ? 5 . Is acupuncture feasible option help ameliorate symptom effect ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research indicate patient undergo curative RT various cancer experience adverse immune effect , indicate reduce biomarker level activity . RT observe cause strike reduction total lymphocyte count , affect mainly T-cells . Furthermore , reduction lymphocyte count RT correlate poor outcome bladder cancer , head neck cancer , uterine cancer , brain metastasis . Research use complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) conduct determine utility treatment address unmet need many patient cancer . There preliminary evidence acupuncture , particular , successful improve many cancer treatment associate effect . Earlier study indicate acupuncture play role regulate immune system response various morbidity , include chemotherapy induced immunosuppression . However , little research examine potential radiation therapy patient This pilot study aim assess wide range general immune biomarkers identify biomarkers affect RT . Through use symptom assessment survey , change self report symptom also record . The feasibility acupuncture strategy ameliorate adverse immune symptom effect also examine . This information could useful plan future study RT immune system , potential immune benefit acupuncture .</detailed_description>
