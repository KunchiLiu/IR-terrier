	<brief_summary>The investigator try find efficacy platelet rich plasma injection treatment osteoarthritis ( OA ) subtalar joint . Autologous platelet-secreted growth factor ( GFs ) may therapeutic effect OA capsular joint via multiple mechanism . The investigator aim examine effect platelet-derived preparation rich growth factor ( PRGFs ) OA subtalar joint , use parameter pain , function , quality life safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Platelets Rich Plasma Injection With PRGF Method Treatment Osteoarthritis Subtalar Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The therapeutic use autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) constitute relatively new biotechnology breakthrough stimulation acceleration soft-tissue bone healing In process PRGF ( preparation rich growth factor ) combine advantage autologous fibrin clot aid hemostasis well provide growth factor high concentration site tissue defect . The platelet-rich plasma preparation encourage release slow delivery growth factor harvest platelet , activate endogenous thrombin , use biological enhancer heal fracture , lumbar fusion , cartilage defect , muscle tear tendon lesion , thus promote initiation early maturation bone soft tissue formation involve physiologic repair less scar tissue . Few tubes whole blood drown patient sterile manner go process centrifugation laboratory separation different plasma fraction . Then , derive benefit describe natural mechanism , Ca2+ add plasma enrich platelet , trigger formation fibrin matrix contain embed platelet . The result PRGF allow slow release biologically active protein initiate modulate wound heal soft hard tissue . The objective clinical trial evaluate symptomatic efficacy PRGF application treatment OA Sub-Talar joint . base knowledge protocol briefly : 1st visit : Enrollment patient 1 . The patient give full verbal write explanation regard trial treatment . investigator . The patient sign inform consent form give serial number . 2 . The screening form : VAS SCORE ANKLE-HINDFOOT SCORE completed- 3 . Demographic data : date birth , sex , age complete medical history , weight , height previous treatment record . 4 . Clinical examination perform . 5 . Blood ( 4 tube , 4-5 '' l ) drawn patient . The blood take PRGF group patient use preparation PRGF . Intra-Articular injection ( PRGF ) initiate . TREATMENT PROCEDURES AND FOLLOW UP VISITS CLINICAL-RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT - Clinical assessment patient shall make enrollment , 4 , 12 , 26 week enrollment . - The clinical assessment accord Ankle- Hindfoot , VAS SCORES . - The radiological evaluation accord Kellgren lawrence perform AP Lateral view knee . Side effect monitor every visit</detailed_description>
