	<brief_summary>This study phase I study cell base prostate cancer therapy , Autologous Lymphoid Effector Cells Specific Against Tumor-cells ( ALECSAT ) . Safety tolerability single dose show 13 prostate cancer patient . In study 20 prostate cancer patient receive 3 dos ALECSAT treatment . In therapy specific cell patient 's immune system isolate , activate re-administered patient boost specific immune response cancer cell . The aim study show safety tolerability repeat dose type therapy . It hypothesis cell administer therapy attack tumor cell way stop slow progression disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Repeated Dosing Cytotoxic Lymphocytes ( CTL ) Based Prostate Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective open phase I study investigate safety tolerability administration repeat dos cell base medicinal product ( CBMP ) ALECSAT . ALECSAT autologous CBMP make patient 's blood cell . ALECSAT contain large amount tumour specific cytotoxic Lymphocytes ( CTL ) Natural Killer ( NK ) cell isolate activate amplified number . The CBMP give slow i. v. injection patient prostate cancer . The patient late stage disease receive hormone treatment disease progressing . The primary objective study observe side effect tolerability issue occur consequence repeat administration ALECSAT , secondarily observe change Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level positive anti tumor effect may observe . The study purpose investigate whether repeat treatment ALECSAT way toxic . Trial Design : The study open , prospective phase I safety study ALECSAT prostate cancer patient . A group consist 4 patient treated twice ALECSAT accord protocol . Then interim analysis do . If sign significant toxicity relate treatment , study continue third treatment patient 14 patient treat ALECSAT accord protocol . Thus study include total 20 patient . The patient first administration ALECSAT hospitalize 2 day . Five 10 week later patient hospitalize 1 day receive second third administration ALECSAT . Each patient furthermore follow closely 12 week third treatment . During course entire study patient monitor 11 plan study visit , investigator Department Urology , Fredrikssund Hospital , Denmark .</detailed_description>
