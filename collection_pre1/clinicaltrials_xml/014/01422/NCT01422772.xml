	<detailed_description>All patient expect undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Graft screen participation clinical study . Subjects sign informed consent receive screening test within 21 day surgery ( Day 0 ) . VM202RY inject 4 site 8 site coronary artery complete revascularization do since vascular anastomosis could perform due bad vascular condition surgery . VM202RY administer Group1 ( 0.5mg ) , Group 2 ( 1mg ) Group 3 ( 2mg ) different concentration . Subjects schedule get inpatient treatment gene therapy period ( 7 day ) follow-up test Week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 base surgery day ( Day 0 ) . Adverse event concomitant drug check .</detailed_description>
