	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease one common chronic infectious disease know human , report prevalence vary 10 % -60 % adult . Periodontal health commonly affect pregnancy . The prevalence pregnancy gingivitis varies widely , range around 35 % - 100 % . Although , periodontal change pregnancy reversible female preexist periodontitis metabolic disease diabetes may suffer increased periodontal destruction may exhibit significantly great probe pocket depth attachment level . Periodontal disease , source persistent infection , may induce systemic inflammatory response increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome . However , far result mixed . As vitamin D metabolite may also alter inflammatory response antimicrobial effect thus use vitamin D may affect periodontal status . Evidence suggest association exists low serum level Vitamin D periodontal attachment loss . If investigator take factor consideration , broad picture reveals vitamin D deficiency prevalent Pakistan , pregnant female likely compromise periodontal health probably poor pregnancy outcome .</detailed_description>
