	<brief_summary>This study multi-site , double-blind , randomize , control clinical trial ass safety effectiveness plasticity-based , adaptive , computerized-based cognitive remediation treatment versus computer-based control . The investigator propose computerized cognitive remediation program base upon principle brain plasticity may improve information processing thus drive clinically significant improvement cognitive functional performance individual schizophrenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The symptom schizophrenia fall three main category : positive symptom , negative symptom , cognitive symptom . Each category represent distinct functional challenge impede patient productivity overall quality life . Cognitive symptom pervasive result deficit executive functioning ( ability understand information use make decision ) , attention ( ability identify , select , focus relevant sensory event ) , work memory ( ability hold information memory guide action ) . These symptom impair patient ' ability successfully perform everyday activity , include independent living , employment , social relationship , addition cause great emotional distress . Cognitive impairment schizophrenia receive substantial academic study , 24,000 research paper publish field since 1990 . This enormous body work show cognitive impairment likely present virtually patient schizophrenia , regardless severity illness treatment status . People schizophrenia typically perform 1-2 standard deviation mean age-matched control ( indicate substantial impairment ) across domain speed information processing , attention , work memory , verbal visual learning , reason social cognition . While cognitive impairment schizophrenia originally assume secondary positive negative symptom disorder , relate use anti-psychotic medication , recent research conclusively show neither past assumption true . For example , landmark Clinical Antipsychotic Trials Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) trial involve 1,493 participant demonstrate negative symptom mildly correlate cognitive function , positive symptom completely uncorrelated cognitive function . Furthermore , research show cognitive impairment evident people schizophrenia medicate , prior diagnosis , first-degree relative people diagnose schizophrenia ; indicate medication cause cognitive impairment . In aggregate , data establish well-accepted current viewpoint cognitive dysfunction core primary symptom deficit schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
