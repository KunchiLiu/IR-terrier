	<brief_summary>The start point ELOISE significant number Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) survivor die transfer ward . This mortality rate nullifies sophisticate diagnostics life-support therapy adopt ICU . The inadequate care available destination ward suggest one reason explain bad outcome ICU survivor , hospital enough ICU bed prolong ICU stay patient fully recover . Therefore , Inter Mediate Care Units ( IMCU ) level nurse staff cost low ICU high ward propose facilitate discharge ICU patient . Unfortunately literature provide evidence efficacy IMCU . The primary aim study ass whether patient admitted ICUs availability IMCU low hospital mortality admit ICU without availability IMCU . Secondary aim follow : 1 . To compare Lengths Of ICU Hospital Stay ( LOIS LOHS , respectively ) patient admit ICUs without availability IMCU . 2 . To assess influence IMCU rate ICU readmission . 3 . To compare hospital survival patient discharge IMCU general ward ( hospital without availability IMCU ) adjust severity illness nurse workload ICU discharge . This last aim require large sample size ( 10,000 ) , hope collect sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite high cost Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , significant number patient survive intensive care die subsequently hospital transfer ward . Mortality rate discharge ICU report range 6.1 27 % In 2000 , report premature discharge ICU likely occur night associate high death rate . Suggested factor might account bad outcome night discharge poorer quantity quality care available night transfer destination . The implication study health system many hospital enough ICU bed . To facilitate early ICU discharge ICU patient think need care provided ward , InterMediate Care Units ( IMCU ) level nursing staff ( cost ) low ICU propose decade ago . Despite relevance topic , literature efficacy cost-effectiveness IMCU available present show variable result . And potential benefit IMCUs remain uncertain . The striking probably follow question : - Does IMCU decrease hospital mortality rate ICU patient ? - Does IMCU allow early ICU discharge hence improve patient flux ICU reduce ICU cost ? - Does IMCU permit reduction ICU readmission ? We propose address issue large multinational , multicentre study .</detailed_description>
