	<brief_summary>A loss mobility shoulder direction internal rotation associate shoulder tendon pathology . Cause-effect relationship two still clear . It suspect loss mobility reduce size tunnel shoulder tendon lying , namely subacromial space . Overhead athletes frequently show glenohumeral internal rotation deficit ( GIRD ) healthy free shoulder pain . This make population interest investigate . This study want look shoulder overhead athlete GIRD measure size subacromial space . After , athlete instruct perform home stretch program end effect mobility size subacromial space measured.60 athlete recruit randomly allocate control group stretch group . Before start stretching , subacromial space size measure use ultrasound . This safe non-invasive measuring tool . Mobility measure use digital inclinometer . This also safe non-invasive . Patients instruct stretch exercise , perform home day 6 week . At end outcome measure reassess .</brief_summary>
