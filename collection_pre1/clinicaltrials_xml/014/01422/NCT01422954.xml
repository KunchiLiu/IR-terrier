	<brief_summary>Malaria one major infectious disease world tremendous impact quality life , significantly contribute ongoing poverty endemic country . It cause 800.000 death per year , majority child age five . The malaria parasite enters human body skin , bite infected mosquito . Subsequently , invades liver develop multiplies inside hepatocytes . After week , hepatocytes burst open parasite release blood stream , cause clinical phase disease . As unique opportunity study malaria immunology efficacy immunisation strategy , protocol develop past conduct control human malaria infection ( CHMIs ) . CHMIs generally involve small group malaria-naïve volunteer infect via bite P. falciparum infect laboratory-reared Anopheline mosquito . Although potentially serious even lethal , P. falciparum malaria radically cure early stage blood infection risk complication virtually absent . The investigator show previously healthy human volunteer protect malaria mosquito ( sporozoite ) challenge immunization sporozoite ( mosquito bite ) chloroquine prophylaxis ( CPS immunization ) . Interestingly , sterile protection 100 % human CPS immunize volunteer achieve relatively miniscule dose , i.e . total 45 infectious mosquito bite , strikingly 20-fold potent 1000 bite need model use irradiated mosquito . One possible explanation efficient induction protective immunity , immune modulate effect chloroquine . The investigator aim ass possible immune modulate effect CPS immunization compare immunization P. falciparum sporozoites chloroquine immunization mefloquine prophylaxis , antimalarial effect , immune modulating effect know chloroquine .</brief_summary>
