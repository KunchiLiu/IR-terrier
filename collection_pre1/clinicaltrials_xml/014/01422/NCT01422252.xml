	<detailed_description>Objectives study : Principal objective : To evaluate evolution 6 month fall occur home people 75 equip non-equipped precocious detection device . Prospective interventional study . Secondary objective : To establish relation alert emitted device , time separate fall arrival hospital potential MORBI-mortality To describe sequence intervention different operator Methodology : Multicenter , prospective , cohort , interventional study . Pattern study : The study comprehend 2 visit realize 10-month interval . Visits : 1 . Randomization , inclusion selection visit ( Visit 1 ) : The inclusion subject effective enlighten consent sign , check inclusion criterion . Inclusion standardize question realize medical evaluator . The data obtain question subject need relatives GP . The question carry questionnaire independent card comprise frailty element . Independently , follow-up operate home nurse HPGM Les Magnolias hospital maintenance adhesive patch change regularly nearly every 10 day person equip , study plan installation Vigi'Fall速 device peculiar measure coverage . At conclusion first report , whole questionnaire pick participant charge complete potential miss data . Via colligation miss data , exhaustiveness data automatically check . 2 . End study visit ( Visit 2 ) : 10 month 10 month installation Vigi'Fall速 device , contact establish subject need relative GP inform evolution well appearance potential fall characteristic . - Relation alert , intervention time evolution : Theses relation investigate possible accuracy . The standardized questioning complete investigator maximal exhaustiveness . - Description sequence intervention : These sequence evaluate via simple standardized questionnaire . - Expected result , perspectives scientific data : To quantify accuracy evolution person 75 equip precocious detection device fall occur home comparison witness population non equip . To establish relation alert emitted device , time separate fall arrival hospital potential MORBI-mortality . To describe possible accuracy time sequence different operator To quantify rate subject hospitalize ( duration hospitalization ) , subject still live home leave admitted institution ( nursing home , retirement home ... ) different group . The information hence obtain enable good knowledge tool detection precocious alert fall elderly . - Direct benefit geriatrician , sanitary care professional emergency physician : Change practice : Prevision subject likely benefit precocious detection device . Development prevention hospital geriatric department , geriatric care network , emergency department local service elderly disable ( SDPAH ) . Education : Sensitize medical , paramedical social team usefulness precocious detection device elderly subject risk fall .</detailed_description>
