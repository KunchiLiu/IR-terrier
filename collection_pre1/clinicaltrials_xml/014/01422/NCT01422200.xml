	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare immune response two different injection method ( Intramuscular V.S . Subcutaneous ) 2011-2012 seasonal Influenza ( Flu ) vaccine among patient neuromuscular condition significant muscle degeneration . This research study hypothesize subcutaneous route vaccine administration , compare intramuscular route , may confer least comparable , possibly well , immunogenicity . At least 30 individual follow CCHMC Neuromuscular Comprehensive Care Center recruit participate study last approximately one two month two clinic visit one follow-up telephone call . Immunogenicity assess compare hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer obtain pre- post-vaccination .</brief_summary>
