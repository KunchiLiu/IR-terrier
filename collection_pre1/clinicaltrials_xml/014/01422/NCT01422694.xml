	<brief_summary>Background : - Spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) group bone joint disorder may cause back joint pain stiffness . In case , SpA lead abnormal bone growth affect joint spine . Some patient SpA without ever develop growth , others develop year . Researchers interested study people SpA relatives determine people likely develop severe condition . Objectives : - To identify symptoms medical test help determine whether person SpA risk develop severe form disease . Eligibility : - Individuals age diagnose SpA . - Healthy volunteer relative ( least 6 year age ) individual SpA . Design : - Participants screen medical record family medical history , invite clinical center study . - Participants SpA physical exam medical history , include study joint movement , blood urine test , questionnaire pain quality life . - Participants SpA image study , include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Other sample skin tissue bone marrow may also collect study . - Healthy volunteer provide blood sample cheek cell sample . - No treatment provide , although treatment option discuss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol study natural history spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) child adult . Spondyloarthritis encompass spectrum immune-mediated inflammatory disease exhibit overlap feature , differ type inflammatory arthritis genetic predisposition , pathogenesis , outcome . Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) , common form SpA , frequently begin undifferentiated form back pain stiffness adult , lead aberrant ossification ankylosis ( fusion ) spine . In child , SpA rarely present back pain , instead often begin pain stiffness hip knee due arthritis . Enthesitis , inflammation tendon ligament connect bone , common child . Our ability recognize early form AS involve axial skeleton , particularly child , understand cause progression disease , limit . The goal natural history protocol establish cohort pediatric adult patient SpA prospectively evaluate sign symptom , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) X-ray finding , bone inflammatory biomarkers associate axial disease . We study pathogenic mechanism include role AS susceptibility gene variant cause disease , identify patient possible entry future treatment study . Patients enrol protocol undergo history , physical examination , image study , laboratory evaluation . When clinically indicate , patient may also evaluate extra-articular manifestation acute anterior uveitis , psoriasis skin problem , inflammatory bowel disease . Peripheral blood sample collect affected patient , unrelated healthy volunteer , case unaffected family member help identify study gene involve SpA function . We may ask patient undergo skin biopsy bone marrow aspiration research purpose . For small number patient family member , may ask permission perform whole genome exome sequencing . Fibroblasts and/or peripheral blood cell obtain patient induced become pluripotent stem cell maintain indefinitely culture differentiate cell type relevant pathogenesis . Successful completion study allow rheumatologist well recognize early SpA axial involvement , particularly child , improve understand disease pathogenesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects know suspected SpA provide inform consent evaluate either outpatient inpatient unit NIH Clinical Center . To eligible followup visit patient must meet Inclusion Criteria , Exclusion criterion . Subjects determine SpA follow . Patients sign symptom SpA classify outlined # 1 # 2 ( see Appendix 10.1 Classification Criteria ) : 1 . Patients le 16 year age consider SpA meet ILAR criterion ERA ( without psoriasis positive family history psoriasis ) , modify NY criterion AS . 2 . Patients 16 year age old consider SpA previously meet ILAR criterion ERA , currently meet ESSG Amor criterion USpA , ASAS criteria Axial SpA , modify NY criterion AS . 3 . Family member individual include item 1 2 . Family member ask submit bone marrow aspiration interruption therapy . 4 . Controls clinical , cellular , molecular , biochemical assay , genetic evaluation enrol . Individuals undergo phlebotomy specifically provide control specimen 6 year age old , pregnant . 5 . Minor healthy volunteer undergo imaging ( SI and/or WB MRI ) must old enough complete procedure without sedation . Generally require least 6 year age , healthy volunteer age 6 enrol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Inability provide inform consent , case minor , unavailability parent guardian . 2 . Presence medical condition would , opinion investigator , confuse interpretation study . 3 . Unavailability , inability comply schedule followup visit .</criteria>
