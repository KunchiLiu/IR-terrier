	<brief_summary>This study design investigate safety feasibility use chemotherapy drug , Clofarabine , reduce disease burden donor transplant , patient high risk Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Myelodysplasia ( MDS ) . In study Clofarabine chemotherapy give day reduce full intensity donor stem cell transplant without wait normal blood count recover . It hop approach may improve outcome patient high risk AML MDS transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Pre-conditioning With Allogeneic Transplant Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study . Twenty patient total treat two cohort 10 patient . - Cohort One : Patients suitable full intensity condition receive Clofarabine pre-conditioning follow Cyclophosphamide Total Body Irradiation condition allogeneic stem cell transplant . - Cohort Two : Patients suitable full intensity TBI-based transplant due age co-morbidity receive Clofarabine pre-conditioning follow reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant use Fludarabine , intravenous Busulphan Campath 1H . The cohort recruit concurrently . It anticipate recruitment 20 subject achieve 18 month two year . The study conduct single centre ( Southampton , UK ) first instance . This design allow use full intensity , TBI-based transplant conditioning schedule , young patient able tolerate approach also use reduce intensity transplant conditioning schedule old less fit patient may still benefit pre-conditioning Clofarabine follow allogeneic stem cell transplant . This design , therefore , restrict potential recruitment study age performance status alone ( within limit set ability tolerate intensive chemotherapy transplant procedure ) .</detailed_description>
