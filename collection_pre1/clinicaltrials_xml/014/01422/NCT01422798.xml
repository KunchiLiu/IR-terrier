Diagnosis childhood TB usually base exposure history set clinical , radiological biological sign consider separately rather low predictive value . There consensus optimal way combine sign . This even complex child infect HIV . The risk TB infection disease , TB clinical presentation depend child 's age , young high risk . An important first step improve management childhood TB good define clinical radiological characteristic child suspect TB first presentation health service endemic setting ; also document feasibility tolerability TB treatment age cohort . This initial descriptive study would help pave way rigorous study evaluate novel diagnostics conduct clinical trial first second line TB treatment child , future . The main objective study improve diagnosis TB child set high TB HIV prevalence ass treatment outcome tolerance new WHO recommend TB drug dosage .

For child produce sputum , sputum induction propose . Children indication TB treatment follow 6 month completion TB treatment ( total 12 month ) treatment efficiency , tolerability acceptability assessment . Children without indication TB treatment undergo systematic clinical assessment 3 month . Finally , clinical file TB suspect retrospectively review 2 independent paediatric TB expert order classify case Confirmed TB , Certain TB , Probable TB Unlikely TB case . A total 385 paediatric TB suspect ( 1 month-14 year ) screen paediatric ward , OPD , HIV clinic MNRH , Holy Innocents child 's hospital The AIDS support organisation ( TASO ) Mbarara .</detailed_description>
