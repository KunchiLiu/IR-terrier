	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine practice joint movement use specially design device help recovery muscle function arm/hand stroke . Subjects may qualify participation study stroke difficulty use affected arm/hand ever since .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Recovery Muscle Function Arm/Hand After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause long-term adult disability United States , hemiparesis common motor impairment frequently lead persistent deficit hand function . The mechanisms recovery hand motor function stroke poorly understood , protocol use clinical practice lack solid scientific rationale . The long-term objective research understand neural mechanism underlie recovery voluntary motor function brain-injured patient order provide objective scientific basis rehabilitation protocol use clinical practice . Dr. Preeti Raghavan Dr. Donald Weisz , research study doctor , name inventor device use investigated part research study . These device use facilitate training either unimanual bimanual movement use acute chronic post-stroke period , even little active movement affect upper extremity . The specially design mechanical device ( BAT , PST WIFIT ) , Psychophysical method use instrumented glove , electromyographic recording upper extremity muscle investigate follow specific aims patient post-stroke hemiparesis lead : - great extensor muscle activation synergy movement compare unimanual training facilitate external agent ( e.g . another person ) . - Bimanual training specially design mechanical device ( BAT , PST WIFIT ) 6 week produce great functional recovery affect upper extremity patient post-stroke hemiparesis , compare conventional therapy . - The gain motor control function great patient begin bimanual training acute post-stroke phase ( 0-6 ) month , compare begin chronic post-stroke phase ( &gt; 6 month ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability follow study instruction likely complete require visit ; ability comply therapy protocol assess investigator ; must English speaking . Subjects must unilateral stroke Severe upper extremity spasticity suggest Ashworth score &gt; 3 joint , restriction full passive range motion . Evidence alcohol , drug abuse relevant neuropsychiatric condition psychotic illness severe depression . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . History surgery significant injury either upper extremity cause mechanical limitation preclude task performance . Previous neurological illness head trauma , prior stroke , epilepsy , demyelinate disease . Complicating medical problem uncontrolled hypertension , diabetes sign polyneuropathy , severe renal , cardiac pulmonary disease , evidence concurrent neurologic orthopedic condition preclude subject comply study protocol</criteria>
