	<brief_summary>Pain ambulatory surgery remain unsolved problem The United States Europe . It associate delayed hospital discharge result increase opioid consumption adverse side effect . The concept multimodal analgesic technique introduce 15 year ago several technique study year include non steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , acetaminophen , gabapentoids , ketamine , local regional anesthetic technique . Histamine effect polymodal nociceptors C-fibers , produce pain increase neurogenically mediate release substance P afferent pain fiber . Several non-selective H1 -selective histamine receptor antagonist demonstrate animal model clinical pain . Chia et al demonstrate preoperative promethazine opioid spar property without adverse sedative effect patient undergo abdominal hysterectomy . Diphenhydramine anti-histamine drug find effective reduce postoperative nausea vomit ambulatory surgery effect postoperative pain important outcome ambulatory surgery time meet discharge criterion study . The MQOR 40 validate instrument specifically design evaluate patient recovery anesthesia surgery . This instrument particularly valid examine intervention affect different sphere patient recovery case diphenhydramine . The objective study determine dose response effect preoperative diphenhydramine postoperative quality recovery ambulatory surgery . The use preoperative diphenhydramine improve patient 's quality recovery , decrease postoperative pain , opioid consumption opioid related side effect ambulatory surgery . The research question : Does preoperative dose diphenhydramine improve postoperative quality recovery ambulatory surgery ? The hypothesis study preoperative diphenhydramine improve postoperative pain , Postoperative nausea vomit ( PONV ) , sleep translate well overall quality recovery .</brief_summary>
