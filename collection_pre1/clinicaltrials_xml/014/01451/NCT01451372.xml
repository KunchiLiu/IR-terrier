	<brief_summary>The aim study document routine practice continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) patient treat sensor-augmented pump therapy assess clinical outcome ( HbA1c ) start sensor use end follow-up period . Moreover , data treatment satisfaction , fear hypoglycemia , cost therapy , side effect treatment interruption collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Routine Use Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy - Follow Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advanced technology treatment type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) include insulin pump continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) glucose sensor allow continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) . Randomized controlled trial show access CGM improve control poorly-controlled patient regardless insulin treatment therapy via reduce hyper- hypoglycaemic excursion improve mean HbA1c value . The Medtronic personal CGM device compose glucose sensor link MiniLink REAL-Time Transmitter , transmit data glucose sensor insulin pump . The integration two technology ( CSII personal CGM ) one system call sensor-augmented pump therapy ( SAP ) .The device CE-marked routinely use clinical practice Swedish market . Based clinical evidence provide , Swedish Dental Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency ( TLV ) conclude personal CGM use combination Medtronic insulin pump SAP include Swedish reimbursement system . However decision upon specific patient indication : Patients two severe hypoglycemias/year require help another person Patients HbA1c least 9 % , case optimize insulin therapy effective Children take least 10 medically require plasma glucose test ( fingersticks ) per 24 hour certain follow-up information complement submit TLV March 1st , 2012 . TLV require follow-up information T1 diabetes patient use SAP Swedish clinical practice base follow outcome parameter : HbA1c-level patient Quality life use CGM Side effect therapy interruption . Use cost therapy Frequency hypoglycemia Therefore , project observe routine practice personal CGM utilization combination Medtronic insulin pump T1DM patient Sweden approximately 15 investigational center . The aim project reflect daily practice personal CGM therapy ( sensor MiniLink REAL-Time Transmitter ) usage diabetes patient treat Medtronic insulin pump Sweden . Data HbA1c value six month use personal CGM collect information outcome request TLV include study . The patient report outcomes supplemented patient preference data estimate willingness-to-pay ( WTP ) approach .</detailed_description>
