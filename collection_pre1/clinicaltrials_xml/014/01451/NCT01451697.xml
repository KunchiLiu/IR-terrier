The investigator thus randomize 20 patient compulsive hoard receive either cognitive remediation placebo condition . Before treatment , investigator aim assess effect cognitive remediation neuropsychological functioning hoard severity . The primary specific aim examine whether cognitive remediation improve cognitive function compulsive hoarder . The investigator hypothesize compulsive hoarding patient treat cognitive remediation demonstrate improve cognitive skill post-treatment compare patient receive placebo . This especially true attention ; memory executive function skill may also improve . A secondary , exploratory aim examine whether cognitive remediation improve hoard severity , compare placebo .
