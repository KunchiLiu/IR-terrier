	<brief_summary>This study design compare effect alkalinize lidocaine endotracheal tube cuff bolus dose remifentanil give prior emergence anesthesia : - incidence perioperative cough - time need emergence desflurane-based anesthesia - incidence sore throat extubation . The investigator hypothesis use alkalinize lidocaine endotracheal tube cuff reduce incidence perioperative cough desflurane-based anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Alkalinized Lidocaine Compared Remifentanil Incidence Coughing During Emergence Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence important period general anesthesia several problem occur . Coughing , hypertension , tachycardia agitation observe emergence general anesthesia . Desflurane newer volatile agent allow early recovery anesthesia . This agent lead early discharge rapid resumption normal activity surgery . However , incidence cough around 70 % report desflurane-based anesthesia . Different technique drug study reduce cough emergence . Among others , role lidocaine give intravenously , topically , intracuff study . The use intracuff alkalinize lidocaine proven effective reduce incidence cough emergence anesthesia . Furthermore , evidence support administration intravenous opioids prior emergence general anesthesia reduce perioperative coughing , agitation hemodynamic stimulation . However , depend type opioids give , may delay emergence anesthesia . The effect remifentanil infusion give combination isoflurane volatile agent show reduce incidence perioperative coughing without delay emergence anesthesia . Bolus dos remifentanil also proven effective reduce hemodynamic response extubation . The effect two modality ( alkalinized lidocaine remifentanil ) never compare . This study ass efficacy prevent perioperative cough desflurane-based anesthesia .</detailed_description>
