	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Shenwu Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) refers group individual cognitive impairment insufficient severity constitute dementia1 , transitional stage normal age dementia . Amnestic MCI common subtype MCI , show least reversion normal , define significant impairment memory impairment activity daily live . In interventional study patient meet Petersen criterion amnestic MCI , 16 % progressed dementia per year , 99 % receive AD diagnosis . Hence , MCI , particular amnestic MCI generally recognize many case represent prodromal AD become new target prevention treatment AD . The specific aim study evaluate change Efficacy safety shenwu capsule treat amnestic MCI . Using randomize controlled parallel group design , 324 old adult diagnose amnestic MCI participate 6-month supervise protocol either shenwu capsule donepezil . Cognitive test blood collection occur baseline , month 3 6 . Before 6-month intervention , medial temporal atrophy ( MTA ) hippocampal volume atrophy CT MRI scan assess subject . The result study may provide support safer inexpensive treatment strategy specifically target individual mild cognitive impairment directly influence risk develop dementia older adult .</detailed_description>
