	<brief_summary>Anesthesia cesarean section great challenge anesthesiologist , mother fetus closely related . So challenge anesthetize mother without interfere physiology fetus . The spinal block , although safe , free complication treat properly , may responsible increase fetal morbidity . Among major side effect , hypotension , potentially serious consequence maternal-fetal dyad . Hypotension pregnant woman low risk may lead major damage , pregnant woman low reserve , case pregnant woman pre-eclampsia , drop blood pressure mother bring harm welfare mother fetus . Based , purpose study compare effect maternal perinatal treatment hypotension ephedrine metaraminol pregnant woman severe preeclampsia undergoing cesarean section spinal anesthesia . There randomize , double-blind , include pregnant woman severe preeclampsia indication cesarean section , gestational age 34 week gestation only.Will Excluded woman hemorrhagic syndromes pregnancy , HELLP syndrome , eclampsia , cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease , fetal distress absolute contraindication spinal anesthesia . All patient fully inform research objective include study agree participate sign Instrument Consent . The project design follow recommendation Resolution 196/96 National Health Declaration Helsinki research involve human subject ( 2000 ) . In addition , project submit Ethics Committee Research Institute Integrative Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira , approve . The study conduct June 2011 July 2012 . The study variable : consumption metaraminol ephedrine birth , occurrence nausea vomiting , incidence maternal hypotension , occurrence reactive hypertension , occurrence bradycardia , pH umbilical cord , Apgar score 5 minute , need face mask ventilation ICU admission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ephedrine , long time consider safe drug mother fetus treatment hypotension Caesarean section . However , recent evidence show contrary think , ephedrine appear increase fetal metabolism , decrease pH excess base . Recently , phenylephrine use treatment hypotension cesarean delivery well result relation acid-base parameter umbilical cord blood . However , data available use phenylephrine high-risk pregnancy , majority study healthy pregnant woman elective caesarean section . Although little scientific evidence regard use metaraminol treatment hypotension Caesarean section , recent study demonstrate superiority drug compare ephedrine , check low incidence neonatal acidosis well control blood pressure . The researcher also find difference blood gas umbilical cord ephedrine metaraminol group large already find previous study compare ephedrine phenylephrine . The pathophysiological change patient pre-eclampsia lead intrauterine growth restriction chronic fetal distress , due limit uteroplacental flow , , certain situation , may reduce 50 % 70 % . Added , spinal anesthesia may cause sudden hypotension fetal acidosis often , even elective operation , compare epidural general anesthesia , change may clinical significance healthy fetus term , may critical situation arterial insufficiency uteroplacental fetal distress already present . It believe , therefore , important treat prevent hypotension patient severe preeclampsia spinal anesthesia . Prevention hypotension patient severe preeclampsia require large amount intravenous fluid , careful prophylaxis postural hypotensive syndrome . Despite care , hypotension occurs , aggressive treatment mandatory patient fast order avoid worsen fetal distress neonatal depression . Such patient sensitive vasopressor , therefore , small dos administer . However , big challenge anesthesiologist determine ideal vasopressor pregnant woman high risk , able adequately restore blood pressure level without determine deterioration fetal status . 30 Reynolds Seed 2005 show ephedrine , administer large dos , contribute adverse effect spinal anesthesia ( great degree fetal metabolic acidosis ) , support idea ephedrine vasopressor choice treatment maternal hypotension cesarean section . As result , study fill knowledge gap , take great importance evaluate maternal perinatal outcome pregnant woman severe preeclampsia receive ephedrine metaraminol treatment maternal hypotension caesarean section spinal anesthesia . Considering importance create protocol , since metaraminol , unlike phenylephrine , widely available facility .</detailed_description>
