	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : effectiveness treatment Pompe Disease rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) limit least part patient develop antibody provide rhGAA enzyme . Treatment immunomodulatory drug may dampen eliminate anti-rhGAA immune response patient receive ERT , thereby allow great ERT efficacy . Studying immune response rhGAA may provide valuable insight role immune system effectiveness ERT Pompe Disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Subjects With Pompe Disease Undergoing Immune Modulation Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study determine effect ( ) medication alter immune system anti-rhGAA immune response Pompe patient receive rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) . The investigator would also like determine whether treat Pompe Disease medication affect immune system effect overall health disease progression Pompe . Subjects patient age 0 month 65 year diagnose Pompe Disease , confirm mutational analysis and/or GAA enzyme activity assay . Subjects eligible regardless whether begin enzyme replacement therapy prior enrollment . All Subjects receive enzyme replacement therapy standard care course Study , although may begin ERT treatment time enrollment . In addition ERT , subject may receive immunomodulatory regimen part standard care ; may include rituximab , sirolimus , methotrexate , IVIg immunomodulatory agent pharmacological chaperone N-butyldeoxynojirimycin ( NB-DNJ ) , alone combination , discretion caregiver ( ) .</detailed_description>
