	<brief_summary>Background : - Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) disease muscle unable make protein dystrophin . Without protein , muscle become gradually weak . A new medicine call GSK2402968 test see help prevent slow loss muscle strength . In study , boys DMD healthy volunteer different type image study see one provide best image muscle . This information help researcher use image technique test safety effectiveness GSK2402968 agent . Objectives : - To test magnetic resonance image ultrasound technique detect change muscle boy DMD . Eligibility : - Boys DMD GSK2402968 drug test study . - Healthy boy age study participant . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Healthy volunteer one 2-hour visit three test . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan skeletal muscle heart diaphragm muscle carry . Muscle ultrasound image leg arm muscle also do . Participants perform heavy physical activity like school sport long walk week visit . - Participants GSK2402968 study series test healthy volunteer . The test give study screen phase . They repeat 3 month 6 month receive study agent ( GSK2402968 placebo ) 6 month stop GSK study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) frequent inherit fatal childhood disease . Antisense oligonucleotide ( AON ) -induced exon skip promising therapeutic strategy DMD currently explore clinical trial . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound image method sensitive key process dystrophic muscle edema fat infiltration therefore could serve biomarker disease progression therapeutic response . Our objective explore potential image biomarkers GSK2402968 ( AON ) effect ambulatory boy DMD . The primary objective ass longitudinal change skeletal muscle structural MRI measure reflect fat edema low extremity ambulatory boy DMD receive GSK2402968 placebo Study Population : We aim enroll 65 ambulatory boy DMD . Healthy volunteer/control boy ( 25 ) match age-range recruit obtain pilot data image study . Design : This prospective study skeletal muscle , cardiac , diaphragm image NIH offer subject participate phase 2 , double blind , exploratory parallel-group , placebo-controlled clinical study ambulatory subject DMD result mutation correct exon 51 skip induce GSK2402968 ( parent study ; DMD114876 ) . Subjects travel family member NIH MRI ultrasound assessment screen phase parent study 3 week randomization additionally follow time point parent study : 12 week ( 3 week ) , 24 week ( 3 week ) blind treatment period ; finally , completion 24 week post-treatment phase ( 48 week 4 week ) . If randomize , subject one-time evaluation screen phase parent study . Pilot data also obtain healthy boy ( match age-range ) comparison allow exploration MRI ultrasound measure specific pathology ambulatory boys DMD . Subjects treat GSK2402968 experimental drug NIH . There follow-up termination procedure study . Outcome Measures : Primary Outcome Measure : MRI change skeletal muscle percent fat low extremity use T1w GRE Dixon method 24 week baseline parent study ambulatory boys DMD receive GSK2402968 placebo . Secondary outcome measure : Differences follow outcome measure healthy boy ambulatory boy DMD baseline ; change measure time parent study 12 week , 24 week , 48 week baseline ambulatory boy DMD receive GSK2402968 placebo : 1 . Skeletal muscle MRI : relative muscle fat/water quantify T1w GRE Dixon image method skeletal muscle ; Muscle edema assess T2 imaging ; Muscle fat/water content edema additionally quantify IDEAL-CPMG method ; 2 . Cardiac MRI : Cardiac function ( ejection fraction/ LV function ) assess SSFP Cine MRI manual planimetry LV volumes mass end systole end diastole ; Myocardial fat content assess Multiecho Dixon Fat /Water Separation method ; Myocardial edema assess T2 quantification ; Myocardial T1 assess MOLLI ( modify Look-Locker Inversion recovery ) . Exploratory Outcome Measures : MRI change muscle architecture water diffusivity assess Diffusion EPI MRI . If well tolerate , use portable device ( Ankle IntelliStretch device , RehabTek ) study effect exercise select MRI measure leg muscle . Muscle ultrasound use monitor change skeletal muscle volume , echogenicity stiffness . Dynamic breathe MRI perform measure diaphragm motion free breathing voluntary maximal inspiration exhalation .</detailed_description>
