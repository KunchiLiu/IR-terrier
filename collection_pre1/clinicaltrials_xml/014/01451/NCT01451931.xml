	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize control trial ultrasonography compare compute tomography ( CT ) evaluation patient suspect urolithiasis . The study conduct 15 large urban Emergency Departments ( EDs ) , reflect geographic , socioeconomic , racial ethnic diversity , include academic medical center well safety net hospital . The patient randomize one three arm : 1 ) ultrasound Emergency Department ( ED ) , 2 ) ultrasound radiology 3 ) CT radiology . The investigator collect precise unbiased data comprehensive range outcome allow assessment effectiveness , safety , accuracy cost patient randomize one three group . Taken together , measure intend provide basis valid comparison image patient suspect urolithiasis see ED . The result trial could lead change clinical practice associate improved patient outcome reduce cost . Broad stakeholder involvement within radiology , emergency medicine several subspecialty community seek ensure strategic completion study aim help rapidly disseminate result study clinical practice . This create collaborative network EDs willing act laboratory study comparative effectiveness diagnostic testing . As result , propose trial demonstrate feasibility conduct Randomized Control Trials ( RCTs ) image incorporate measurement outcomes expand additional imaging test future .</detailed_description>
