	<detailed_description>Pneumonia major cause morbidity mortality develop country . Pneumonia predominantly bacterial origin : isolation rate Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae 34 % 40 % , respectively , series lung aspirate collect child 5 year age ( Shann et al. , 1984 ) . Pneumococcal infection lead cause death throughout world major cause pneumonia , bacteremia , meningitis , otitis medium . Strains drug-resistant S. pneumoniae become increasingly common China part world . In area many 35 % pneumococcal isolates report resistant penicillin . Many penicillin-resistant pneumococcus also resistant antimicrobial drug ( e.g. , erythromycin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole extended-spectrum cephalosporin ) , therefore importance vaccine prophylaxis emphasize pneumococcal disease . Epidemiology Pneumococcal infection cause approximately125,000 death annually China . At least 2,500,000 case pneumococcal pneumonia estimate occur annually United States ; S. pneumoniae account approximately 25-35 % case community-acquired bacterial pneumonia person require hospitalization . Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy intensive medical care , overall case-fatality rate pneumococcal bacteremia 15-20 % among adult , among elderly patient rate approximately 30-40 % . An overall case-fatality rate 36 % document adult inner-city resident hospitalize pneumococcal bacteremia . Invasive pneumococcal disease ( e.g. , bacteremia meningitis ) pneumonia cause high morbidity mortality spite effective antimicrobial control antibiotic . These effect pneumococcal disease appear due irreversible physiologic damage cause bacteria first 5 day follow onset illness , occur regardless antimicrobial therapy . Vaccination offer effective mean reduce mortality morbidity disease . Risk Factors In addition young person 65 year age old , patient certain chronic condition increase risk develop pneumococcal infection severe pneumococcal illness . Patients chronic cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure cardiomyopathy ) , chronic pulmonary disease ( e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema ) , chronic liver disease ( e.g. , cirrhosis ) , diabetes mellitus , alcoholism asthma ( occur chronic bronchitis , emphysema , long-term use systemic corticosteroid ) increase risk pneumococcal disease . In adult , population generally immunocompetent . Patients high risk decrease responsiveness polysaccharide antigen increase rate decline serum antibody concentration result : immunosuppressive condition ( congenital immunodeficiency , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , leukemia , lymphoma , multiple myeloma , Hodgkin 's disease , generalized malignancy ) ; organ bone marrow transplantation ; therapy alkylating agent , antimetabolite , systemic corticosteroid ; chronic renal failure nephrotic syndrome . Patients high risk pneumococcal infection functional anatomic asplenia ( e.g. , sickle cell disease splenectomy ) , condition lead reduce clearance encapsulate bacteria bloodstream . Children sickle cell disease splenectomy increase risk outbreak pneumococcal sepsis associate high mortality . Immunogenicity It establish purified pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide induce antibody production antibody effective prevent pneumococcal disease . Clinical study demonstrate immunogenicity 23 capsular type test polyvalent vaccine . Studies 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine child two year old old adult age show immunogenic response . Protective capsular type-specific antibody level generally develop third week follow vaccination .</detailed_description>
