	<brief_summary>Because endobronchial valve one-way inspiratory airway blocker , hypothesize could also use control persistent air leak maintain drainage secretion . The U.S. Food Drug Administration approve October 2008 Spiration valve system design control air leak lung persist lung surgery . This prospective observational study aim evaluate efficacy safety Spiration endobronchial valve prospective series consecutive patient prolong persistent air leak anatomic surgical resection cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persistent Air Leak ( PAL ) independently associate prolonged hospital length stay , decrease patient satisfaction , increase morbidity postoperative complication , add significantly cost . The management air leak primarily preventive therefore start operate room surgical technique minimize occurrence post-operative air leak , creation pleural tent use suture line glue sealant . Notwithstanding patient lung resection PAL . Any minimal invasive method help increase ability treat ( reduce and/or stop ) air leak late case carry enormous clinical well cost-saving potential . Bronchoscopic occlusion segmental subsegmental bronchus use endobronchial valve less invasive method show case report interrupt air leak .</detailed_description>
