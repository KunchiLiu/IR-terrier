	<brief_summary>Balance control sum action sense reaction system . In order perform different activity different posture one must ability control adjust balance different conditions.A deficit brain action follow injury , disease age undermine ability control balance increase risk fall.The limitation gait mobility increase morbidity . There limited number tool evaluate record balance control ability . Most tools observational use clinical field . The aim work estimate feasibility objective tool evaluate balance track objective quantitative measure standard physical therapy session without use expensive equipment . By use tool therapist monitor patient collect quantitive data perform task keep balance . This tool allow therapist detect change balance evaluate effect different condition patient balance . This tool base well know functional reach test . The addition tool test use simple camera computer softwear collect data analyze perform test . This tool give therapist information responsiveness spatiotemporal measure performance . The aim work check contribution spatiotemporal measure functional reach test among patient suffer acquire brain injury understand motor function balance control people suffer brain injury . .</brief_summary>
