	<brief_summary>The intestinal end must rejoin colonic resection . Conventional method include suture stapled anastomosis , associate 3-6 % leakage colonic surgery . The leakage anastomosis cause serious consequence , abdominal infection and/or sepsis . Early detection anastomotic leakage best way avoid serious abdominal infection . The method use today detect leak unfortunately accurate . These method include monitoring symptom , temperature , CRP-levels , perform abdominal examination tomography scan . Because difficulty objectively assess parameter , anastomotic leak often diagnose late . When reoperation require , permanent stoma may make level sigmoid colon . The CARP system develop achieve safe anastomosis . The CARP design provide improve contact surface two intestinal end ability precisely investigate anastomosis surgery use catheter CARP system . Standardized use CARP anastomose large intestine may provide significant advantage field colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
