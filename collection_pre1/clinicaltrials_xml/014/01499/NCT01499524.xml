	<brief_summary>ICP know cause abnormal bile acid homeostasis associate increase risk disease biliary system late life . There small study ( Dann et al . 2006 ; Wójcicka-Jagodzińska et al . 1989 ) suggest cause dyslipidaemia ( raise lipid ) impair glucose tolerance pregnancy . However underlying mechanisms abnormality know . Similarly influence cholestasis fetal metabolism know , role placenta . It also know whether woman ICP predisposition abnormal lipid glucose homeostasis pregnant . GDM characterize raise plasma glucose level pregnant woman ( absence pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus ) . This condition associate large-for-gestational age baby obstruct labour . Women GDM increase risk subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus , condition subsequent pregnancy increase risk stillbirth . This work important understand cause metabolic abnormality associate ICP GDM . If demonstrate abnormal lipid glucose profile , may relevance fetal complication disorder . It also relevance future health affect woman child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Metabolic Profile Intrahepatic Cholestasis Pregnancy Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLINICAL FEATURES OF INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY : Intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy ( ICP ) , pregnancy−specific liver disorder typically present maternal pruritus ( itch ) late pregnancy affect 0.7 % woman UK . Biochemically , characterise liver dysfunction raise serum bile acid , clinically significantly increase incidence fetal complication , include spontaneous preterm labour , fetal distress , meconium stain amniotic fluid sudden fetal death ( Geenes Williamson 2009 ) . The cause ICP complex fully understood . In addition pathological mechanism behind adverse fetal outcome elucidate . The maternal disease likely cause interaction sex hormone metabolites bile acid genetically susceptible woman ( Abu-Hayyeh et al . 2010 ) . To date , others identify genetic variation several biliary transporter e.g . ABCB4 , ATP8B1 , ABCB11 main bile acid receptor , FXR , predispose woman disease ( Dixon et al. , 2000 ; Mullenbach et al. , 2005 ; Pauli−Magnus et al. , 2004 ; Van Mil et al , 2007 ; Dixon et al . 2009 ) . Due inherent toxicity , bile acid also likely responsible fetal component disease . Consistent incidence fetal complication show increased pregnancy level exceed 40 uMol /L ( Glantz et al. , 2004 ) . There currently several theory bile acid may affect fetal wellbeing ; regard increase incidence spontaneous prematurity , show cause premature delivery sheep ( Campos et al. , 1986 ) , increase myometrial contractility response oxytocin ( Germain et al. , 2003 ; Israel et al. , 1986 ) . Furthermore , bile acid also know cause increase colonic motility rabbit ( Snape et al. , 1980 ) cardiac dysrhythmias rat ( Williamson et al. , 2001 ) , could explain meconium stain amniotic fluid sudden fetal death respectively . While know bile acid transport protein placenta , precise role placenta bile , lipid glucose metabolism know . Our group demonstrate cholestasis alters lipid pathway mouse placenta ( unpublished data ) study human . BILE ACID HOMEOSTASIS : Bile acid end product hepatic cholesterol metabolism act main route excretion cholesterol . In adult human two primary bile acid produce liver , i.e . cholic acid chenodeoxycholic acid . There evidence maternal bile acid gradually rise advance gestation , usually remain within normal limit ( &lt; 14 uMol /L ) ( Fulton et al. , 1983 ; Pascual et al. , 2002 ) . This contrast ICP pregnancy , maternal bile acid may raise 100 time upper limit normal ( Walker et al.,2002 ) . In OC , elevate level bile acid also find fetal circulation ( Laatikainen , 1975 ) . THE ROLE OF BILE ACIDS IN LIPID AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM : There accumulate evidence FXR , nuclear hormone receptor responsible regulation bile acid homeostasis , also play role regulation lipid glucose metabolism . FXR null mouse show abnormal blood lipid profile include elevated plasma cholesterol , low density lipoprotein , high density lipoprotein triglyceride level ( Ma , 2006 ) . They also exhibit glucose intolerance reduce insulin sensitivity ( Zhang , 2006 ) . Furthermore , ICP patient raise level cholesterol lipid parameter ( Dann et al . 2006 ) . Specifically , serum concentration low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , apolipoprotein B-100 , cholesterol total cholesterol markedly increase woman ICP . They also show impaired glucose tolerance ( Wójcicka-Jagodzińska et al . 1989 ) . Recent data group ( Martineau et al . 2014 , 2015 ) others ( Marschall et al . 2014 ) show woman ICP increase rate GDM , implicate raise serum bile acid susceptibility diabetes mellitus . Therefore study also include woman ICP superimpose GDM addition woman GDM absence ICP . This enable u evaluate impact cholestasis onset diabetes mellitus pregnant woman . In cholestasis bile acid accumulate liver , result induction pathway enhance bile acid excretion . This may also cause abnormal cholesterol triglyceride level . Bile acid also signal via FXR gut . Bile acid store gallbladder fast state release follow ingestion meal . Once bile acid intestine transport enterocytes ( gut cell ) activate FXR cause production release hormone FGF19 . FGF19 bind FGF4 receptor hepatocytes , signal ( via jnk kinase pathway ) suppress cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1 ) , critical rate-limiting enzyme synthesis bile acid cholesterol . There study gut-liver axis pregnancy , hypothesise abnormal bile acid signal cause raise cholesterol addition increase serum bile acid . Bile acid also bind G-protein-coupled receptor ( TGR5 ) . In gut result release glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) ( Thomas et al . 2009 ) . GLP-1 anti-diabetic hormone increase glucose-dependent insulin production decrease glucagon production pancreas . To date , study relationship cholestasis GDM level fast gut hormone may influence glucose lipid metabolism pregnancy .</detailed_description>
