	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Caspofungin Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis Underlying Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , increase appreciation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) important risk factor invasive pulmoanry aspergillosis ( IPA ) . However , clinical data morbidity mortality IPA underlie COPD well efficacy safety antifungal treatment subset patient population limit . In clinical pratice , capofungin often use primary antifungal therapy IPA , especially patient impaired renal function . Based data , investigator propose study efficacy safety three-week antifungal therapy caspofungin hospitalize patient proven probable IPA underlie COPD .</detailed_description>
