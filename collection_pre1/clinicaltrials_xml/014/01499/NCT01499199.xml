Subjects fulfill eligibility requirement receive dolutegravir ( DTG ) 50 mg daily combination fix dose dual nucleoside reverse transcripatase inhibitor ( NRTI ) abacavir/lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) 96 week . One pair pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample plasma cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) ( matching time ) determination DTG concentration collect Week 2 Week 16 . Samples plasma HIV-1 RNA collect Baseline various time point throughout study sample HIV-1 RNA level CSF collect Baseline , Week 2 Week 16 . Safety , additional measure antiviral activity development viral resistance also evlauated . The primary analysis take place last subject complete 16 week therapy ; additional analysis conduct last subject completes Weeks 2 96 ( end study ) .</brief_summary>
