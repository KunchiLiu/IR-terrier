	<detailed_description>Subjects present degenerative condition lumbar spine amenable surgical treatment screen prior study enrollment . Subjects undergo neuromonitoring XLIF operation , per standard care . They re-evaluated immediately surgery first standard postoperative follow-up visit ( 6 week ) assess presence new neural deficit . If new neural deficit identify , patient follow per Investigator 's standard follow-up schedule symptom resolve ( deemed permanent ) . A total 300 subject enrol study multiple center . The subject degenerative condition lumbar spine plan treatment include XLIF surgery . The following eligibility criterion design identify exist clinic patient study protocol consider appropriate . All subject must meet inclusion/exclusion criterion order consider enrollment .</detailed_description>
