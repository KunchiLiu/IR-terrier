	<brief_title>The Effect 6 Months Local Vibration Training Institutionalized Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As world population age , osteoporosis ( skeletal fragility ) sarcopenia ( decline muscle mass muscle strength ) become increasingly important public health concern . Both osteoporosis sarcopenia contribute increase fall risk increase number hip vertebral fracture . Clearly , clinical economic consequence osteoporosis sarcopenia , result fall fracture , call major effort search efficient feasible intervention prevent reverse bone muscle loss . The present project intend partly meet need . Whole Body Vibration ( WBV ) training might efficient train method . During WBV subject stand platform generates vertical sinusoidal vibration . These mechanical stimulus transmit body stimulate bone reflexive muscle contraction generate . In previous study perform group , investigator find WBV training ( frequency 30-40Hz , peak acceleration 3-10g ) see efficient alternative strength training , young sedentary well elderly population . Additionally , investigator able show 6 month vibration train elderly female result net benefit 1.5 % bone mineral density hip compare control . Finally , investigator recently show long-term vibration training result increase quadriceps muscle mass . From appear vibration therapy could plausible candidate efficient combination therapy elderly subject risk osteoporosis sarcopenia , implication , therapy might help reduce number fall fracture . However , many question regard vibration therapy still need answered order optimize efficacy safety application . The application method vibration therapy optimize applicable broad range subject well deliver stimuli target specific region interest . Whole body vibration present form ( subject stand vibrate platform ) inadequate large part elderly population ( e.g. , subject osteoarthritis knee , wheelchair bound subject , bedridden subject ) . Additionally , transmission vibration stimulus foot hip WBV probably insufficient provoke optimal adaptation level . Delivering vibration stimulus locally ( i.e . target ) region risk fracture need muscle strengthen might efficient alternative application method . The main aim pilot research obtain data allow investigator optimize efficacy safety vibration excitation pattern well optimize application method . With age world population predict rise fall fracture rate , appropriate strategy combat muscle bone loss far reach implication contain future health care expenditure elderly reduce need institutionalize care .</detailed_description>
