	<brief_summary>Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) level urine report increase patient overactive bladder ( OAB ) . Also , administration anti-muscarinic agent report decrease urinary NGF ATP . The investigator aim explore value urinary NGF , PGE2 ATP biomarker predict treatment responsiveness symptom relapse OAB patient . So , patient categorize responder non- responder relapse non-relapse group . Ultimately , receive individualized treatment .</brief_summary>
