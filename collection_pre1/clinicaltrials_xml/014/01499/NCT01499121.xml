	<brief_summary>This prospective single arm study evaluate efficacy safety sunitinib give individualized dosing schedule first-line therapy subject metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer . The treatment schedule intent maximize dose intensity sunitinib minimize time therapy base individual tolerability use protocol direct dose modification criterion . A total 110 subject enrol . All subject continue receive study treatment disease progression withdrawal consent . The primary outcome study progression-free survival ( PFS ) , define duration date patient first receive Sunitinib date death confirm progression accord RECIST criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-arm , single-stage phase II study investigate use individualized dose regimen Sunitinib patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . The intent maximize dose intensity sunitinib minimize time therapy base individual tolerability use protocol direct dose modification criterion . Dose schedule change do toxicity ( hematological , fatigue , skin , GI ) &gt; grade 2 . There dose schedule change hypertension , hypothyroidism , skin color change , heartburn , etc . unless clinically indicate . Subjects continue therapy progression accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . All subject follow progression free survival progression 2 year therapy , grade 3/4 drug relate adverse event record . Fact-G FKSI-DRS use evaluate PRO/QOL baseline every 2 month timepoints . A detailed pharmacokinetic blood sample do subset patient effort understand Sunitinib blood concentration tendency go treatment , show case Sorafenib . Biomarker genomics blood sample correlation progression free survival , toxicity pharmacokinetics collect baseline store .</detailed_description>

Any follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade ≥2 Prolonged QTc interval baseline EKG ( &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female ) . Atrial Fibrillation grade . Uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness active infection . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial , e.g . QOL , image trial allow . Concomitant treatment drug proarrhythmic potential Use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducers 7 12 day dose , respectively Pregnancy breastfeed . Female subject must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female subject reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum ) prior enrolment . Male subject must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study</criteria>
