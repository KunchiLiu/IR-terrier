	<brief_summary>- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) chronic progressive , fibrosing parenchymal lung disease unknown etiology . The prevalence IPF estimate 2-29 case per 100,000 general population median survival rate 2-5 year time diagnose . - Dyspnea chronic dry cough prominent symptom patient cause impaired functional capacity quality life ( QOL ) . - Drug therapy usually ineffective approach , make call effective treatment . - Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) found safe effective treatment increase functional capacity , decrease symptom improve QOL mainly among Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . However , recently grow evidence also support efficiency PR IPF patient . - The Aim suggest study examine effect exercise training ( ET ) ambulatory pulmonary rehabilitation among IPF patient . - The investigator hypothesize ET PR program increase functional capacity , decrease level dyspnea improve QOL IPF patient . - Patients Methods : - 40 IPF patient male female ( age 30-90 year old ) recruiting study . After clinical assessment randomly allocate PR group n=20 Control group n=20 . - All patient undergo clinical assessment include medical history , risk factor IPF physical examination . On first meeting baseline within one week post intervention ( PR ) follow measurement make : dyspnea score , QOL physical activity level questionnaire . In addition , anthropometric measurement , echocardiography , blood sample , pulmonary function test , cardiopulmonary exercise test , battery functional test 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . - The PR group participate 12 week supervise group 's ET program . The training program consist two 6 week block 60 min exercise bout twice week . In first block patient perform aerobic interval training treadmill walking , cycling , step climb . In second block , subject perform long period continuous aerobic exercise , resistance train step climb , unsupported arm/leg exercise without dumbbell ( 0.5-1 kg ) , support body weight chair . Pulmonary function test 6MWT also perform complete first 6 week block . The control group assess baseline 12 week without participate PR program .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>IPF patient diagnose essentially accord American Thoracic European Respiratory Societies ( ATSERS ) clinical diagnostic criterion : Highresolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) demonstrate pattern `` confident '' `` possible '' IPF ( b ) Abnormal pulmonary physiology evidence restriction and/or impair gas exchange ( exist exercise alone ) Exclusion know cause restrictive lung disease ( e.g . : connective tissue disease , environmental exposure , etc Patients severe comorbid illness , unstable coronary artery disease , collagen vascular disease need high flow oxygen therapy ( Ëƒ 34 L\min ) . History syncope exertion comorbidities preclude exercise training ( severe orthopaedic neurological deficit unstable cardiac disease ) . Patients also exclude participated pulmonary rehabilitation program past 12 month .</criteria>
