	<brief_summary>Many patient cancer treat drug call oxaliplatin . This drug use drug treat cancer . The drug cause problem nerve hand foot call peripheral neuropathy ( side effect drug ) . Peripheral neuropathy may make hand foot feel like tingling , burn feeling , cause pain . Almost patient receive oxaliplatin part cancer treatment peripheral neuropathy . Patients side effect usually take low dose stop taking oxaliplatin even drug help cancer . So far lot information make side effect good help go away completely . There information low level Vitamin D blood might link problem diseases nervous system like multiple sclerosis Parkinson 's Disease . It even think Vitamin D may help protect cell nervous system . Because information , researcher want see give patient Vitamin D receive drug oxaliplatin see helps prevent side effect peripheral neuropathy . Patients take oxaliplatin want study take one Vitamin D capsule day take oxaliplatin . Being study affect patient 's cancer treat . There blood test study check Vitamin D level protein call nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . The study team carefully monitor patient sign oxaliplatin-related neurologic toxicity study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Prevention Oxaliplatin-induced Neurotoxicity Through Vitamin D Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin use frequently patient metastatic early-stage colorectal cancer . It find adjuvant setting , Oxaliplatin improve disease free overall survival . Despite result , use Oxaliplatin limit sensory neuropathy numbness tingling , occur 80 % -90 % patient . Some patient develop irreversible debilitating neuropathy , drug may longer use treat cancer . It expect propose study provide new information role Vitamin D pathogenesis Oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity . The dynamic effect Vitamin D calcium nerve growth factor plus recognize state subclinical Vitamin D deficiency compel piece evidence indicate hormone may pivotal position multifactorial pathogenesis neurotoxic reaction induce Oxaliplatin . The specific aim study determine neuroprotective effect Vitamin D. Patients receive Oxaliplatin dose 80 mg/m2 physician determine frequency appropriate underlying malignancy , histological diagnosis malignant solid neoplasm involve GI tract restrict colon , rectum esophagus . Blood collect monitor level Vitamin D nerve growth factor ( NGF ) specific time point . Vitamin D level check month NGF level check bi-weekly . These blood sample collect time patient routine blood draw . Patients take one capsule contain 2000 IUs Vitamin D3 daily , begin 7 day prior first dose Oxaliplatin . Vitamin D3 provide patient long remain study .</detailed_description>
