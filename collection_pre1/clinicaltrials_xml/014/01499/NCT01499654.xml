	<brief_summary>This study recruit patient already schedule single photon emission compute tomography myocardial perfusion imaging ( SPECT-MPI ) test . SPECT-MPI nuclear imaging technique use radioactive substance , radiotracer , special equipment create three-dimensional ( 3D ) image heart . Radiotracer radioactive dye make structure heart visible routinely use view blood flow heart , scan damage heart tissue , assess heart function . For routine SPECT-MPI test , radiotracer give one dose begin test , follow take rest image heart . For study , researcher would like administer half radiotracer , obtain rest image , administer remainder radiotracer obtain second set resting image . Participants receive amount radioactive material would normally give test ; however , administer two half-doses . Participation study add 30 minute time take complete routine test . The investigator expect enroll 160 subject study Northwestern .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects study proceed nuclear cardiology laboratory schedule nuclear stress test . After informed consent obtain , study doctor research staff member ask detailed question subject 's current health , medication medical history , subject 's medical chart review include result previous nuclear image . For test , small catheter ( tube ) place vein subject 's arm administer radioactive imaging agent , Tc-99m sestamibi . Subjects give half ( 1/2 ) normal Tc-99m sestamibi dose study staff obtain resting image picture heart . After set image , subject give remain half radioactive imaging agent follow second set image . After , subject undergo stress portion test usual manner prescribe refer physician .</detailed_description>
