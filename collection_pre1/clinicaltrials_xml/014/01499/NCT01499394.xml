	<detailed_description>The Caris Biorepository effort toward define future medicine incorporate discovery genomic era providing physician , researcher scientist access quality human specimens data aim improve human health fight disease . This accomplish acquire share valuable biospecimen information clinical outcome collaborative , secure environment . The Caris Biorepository bridge gap correlate human specimens clinical specimen data valuable multiple vary entity interested advance science precision medicine target disease treatment . The objective project develop implement state-of-the-science Biorepository ensure molecular integrity clinical relevance human biospecimens use research clinical medicine . The Caris Biorepository also provide vital biospecimens data internal researcher external research collaborator government , academia industry collaborator use drug development discovery , clinically relevant research trial , publication poster , implementation future healthcare policy . This project may also impact characterization trend practice pattern relation patient outcomes well economic implication differ evaluation , treatment management paradigm .</detailed_description>
