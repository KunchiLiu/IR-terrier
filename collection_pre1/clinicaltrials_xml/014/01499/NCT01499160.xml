	<brief_summary>About third patient breast cancer usually treat hormone pill call tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor . Aromatase inhibitor drug stop female hormone production . Female hormone estrogen important hormone growth breast cancer cell . Letrozole one aromatase inhibitor approve FDA use treat breast cancer since 1997 . However , hormone pill usually work 6-10 month patient . Later , breast cancer start grow . This condition hormone pill endocrine therapy longer work call `` endocrine resistant '' breast cancer . The scientist University Maryland discover cancer cell become resistant hormone pill . In laboratory test , investigator find lapatinib everolimus reverse resistance make letrozole work . However , know drug reverse resistance human . The purpose study find whether combination letrozole , lapatinib , everolimus effective woman breast cancer hormone pill longer work . Lapatinib anti-cancer drug already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . It standard care treatment particular type breast cancer call human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast cancer . HER2 protein involved growth cancer cell . This study also include patient HER2-negative breast cancer . This mean cancer cell patient depend HER2 protein . The use lapatinib patient consider experimental . Everolimus also anti-cancer drug approve FDA kidney cancer . Initial study mice later study woman breast cancer show everolimus may also slow growth breast cancer . The use everolimus experimental study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GCC 0901 - Study How Well Letrozole Works Combination With Lapatinib Followed Addition Everolimus Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Endocrine Resistant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-institution clinical trial . Patients stratify accord HER2 status : Group 1 : HER2-positive tumor tissue Group 2 : HER2 negative tumor tissue In first part study , patient receive combination lapatinib 1,500 mg/day letrozole 2.5 mg/day . We expect significant toxicity combination since previous study lapatinib letrozole show combination safe grade 3-4 toxicity observe . Restaging scan ( CT scan , MRI , bone scan ) obtain every 12 week treatment . In patient progress group , everolimus 5 mg/day add letrozole lapatinib reduce 1,250 mg/day per SWOG phase I study lapatinib everolimus . The outcome group continue assess separately . We expect see additional serious toxicity add everolimus combination lapatinib letrozole . All treatment continue disease progression .</detailed_description>
