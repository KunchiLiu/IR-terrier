	<brief_summary>Traditionally cardiac output estimate thermodilution . Recently new non-invasive device approve FDA use child age include neonate ( 4 EKG electrode ) . Primary outcome : To prospectively collect simultaneous physiologic data enrol child transfer data investigator computerize anesthesia record Excel spreadsheet correlate adverse event across monitoring device . Secondary outcome : To determine device provide meaningful data term early warning decrease cardiac output specific subgroup child undergo surgery anesthesia , e.g. , neonate , trauma patient , child congenital heart disease , undergoing procedure expect blood loss , undergo laparoscopic procedure gas insufflation may impede venous return heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study New Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor Children Undergoing General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All child undergo elective emergent surgery GI endoscopy evaluation candidate study . Since FDA approve monitor approve across age group since additional monitor routinely use operating room since noninvasive ( 4 EKG lead ) verbal consent document record approve IRB . After informed verbal consent , either research coordinator study physician populate cardiac output device child 's age , weight , gender height . For old child require 4 EKG electrode apply prior induction anesthesia ( 2 leave side neck 2 leave chest level sternal depression ; neonates infant one electrode apply forehead thigh application space problem ) . For child able cooperative , monitor electrodes place induction general anesthesia . An automated anesthesia record continuously record heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , systolic diastolic pressure . The monitor set perform measurement every 1 minute . New software write enable u interface cardiac output device automate anesthesia record . Thus data cardiac output device insert anesthesia record approximate 1 minute interval real time . The data anesthesia record later download unit Excel spread sheet later analysis . All demographic data also download ( age , weight , ASA physical status , surgical procedure ) well blood loss blood fluid administer well drug , significant intraoperative event , time event evolve . All data enter Partners password protect computer . Initially patient 's medical record number link u electronic anesthesia record record allow u download data . Patient names download . Once data set complete , analyze lock , medical record number remove identifier remain . The data share institution . Only deidentified data remain final data base</detailed_description>
