	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause severe visual impairment UK , Europe N America . Low vision patient AMD great difficulty reading , lead loss independence reduce quality life . Magnifiers alone compensate loss central vision AMD . It propose special low vision training improve reading ability patient AMD . Training programme widely available US Scandinavia , UK , partly lack evidence Randomised Control Trials ( RCT ) show effective . The investigator conduct clinical trial compare conventional hospitalâˆ’based low vision service enhance rehabilitation programme include Eccentric Viewing training . Eccentric view training involves teach patient lose central vision use new area retina visual task . Patients either taught improve use part retina naturally start use central vision lose , so-called preferred retinal locus ( PRL ) , , alternatively , taught use different retinal area think well suit everyday visual task , so-called trained retinal locus ( TRL ) . The investigator plan compare two type eccentric view train conventional hospital-based low vision care .</brief_summary>
