	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) common condition woman , estimate prevalence vary 10 % 40 % study show gradual increase age . UI serious medical problem lead urinary tract infection , low back pain , respiratory disorder , pressure sore , increase risk fall . It also lead social problem , create embarrassment negative self-perception suffer . Women urinary incontinence find isolated relatively inactive . A wide range treatment use management woman 's UI , include conservative intervention , pharmaceutical intervention , surgery . A Cochrane Review 2008 state pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) well treatment UI support recommendation PFMT first treatment line conservative management program woman UI . Recently , article publish look effectiveness treat UI group-like set behavioral modification pelvic floor exercise . One study able prove group train behavioral modification help reduce UI severity , increase pelvic floor strength , reduce void frequency compare control group . All study cite performed community-dwelling person out-patient service intervention . Dr. Fitzgerald colleague The Rehabilitation Institute Chicago ( RIC ) able confirm poster presentation many patient admit inpatient rehabilitation facility UI . In 2005 , 403,697 Medicare beneficiary admit rehab hospital , 24 % incontinent . These study able illustrate UI affect diagnosis . UI show make significant contribution patient outcomes independent functional status admission . It also large determinant discharge destination . In United Kingdom 2004 , 62 % incontinent stroke patient discharge sub acute home 5 % placement continent stroke survivor . Another study determine urinary incontinence stroke predict high likelihood adverse outcome control age , type stroke , length hospital stay . May , et . al. , able state acute rehab set patient spinal cord injury rank bowel bladder care , along skin care , important education class 12 different topic . This show patient find bladder function large priority care , even in-patient setting . In poster presentation mention , many patient UI acute care rehab set improve Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) status admission discharge . Currently research available treatment UI acute care rehab hospital , though show issue many admit . So question arises , `` Would address urinary incontinence physical therapy intervention behavioral modification improve incontinence population acute rehab stage ? ''</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project look possibility treat in-patients UI RIC acute rehab hospital set determine positive outcome possible . Subjects provide individual group session help educate treat suffer UI . Subjects would participate weekly educational class lecture video perform pelvic floor general exercise group set remainder stay . Pre- post- value list outcome measure would take analyzed . The purpose fellowship determine , educational exercise class setting , improvement make woman UI acute rehab hospital . Also , survey use see patient find type intervention satisfactory appropriate level care . Another outcome fellowship expand intervention inpatient unit day rehab site RIC system . Specific Aim # 1 : To determine woman urinary incontinence acute care rehab set satisfied group set treat UI Hypothesis 1 : Women urinary incontinence acute care rehab set find group educational exercise class appropriate acute care rehab hospital setting . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine woman urinary incontinence acute rehab set feel group set educational class lecture video exercise class effective reducing amount severity UI Hypothesis 2 : Women urinary incontinence acute care rehab set find group educational ( lecture video ) exercise class effective reducing amount severity UI Specific Aim # 3 : To determine woman 's quality life improve treat incontinence inpatient rehab set Hypothesis 3 : Quality life improve woman urinary incontinence treat group educational exercise class acute care rehab set . Methods This prospective pilot study 15 woman admit Rehab Institute Chicago . There control group , 15 woman intervention group . Patients select 4th floor inpatient unit . Diagnoses include woman orthopedic injury , spinal surgery , s/p surgical procedure , general debility due hospitalization . All type incontinence include study . UI define episode loss urine last 3 month . 1 . Study participant recruit therapy ( PT OT ) , nursing , medical staff 4th floor Rehabilitation Institute Chicago patient report initial assessment/evaluations . 2 . Investigator determine subject fit inclusion criterion study check medical record subjective interview . 3 . Participants recruit period 8 month expectation enroll 15 woman . 4 . The woman consent participate study give set questionnaire time consent ask complete next session . 5 . Consenting patient undergo internal external pelvic floor muscle examination . These procedure perform investigator . 6 . If upon evaluation , patient perform pelvic floor muscle contraction , enrol educational class pelvic floor exercise class . If extra time need patient improve contraction , patient receive 1:1 time enrol exercise class . 7 . The educational class focus anatomy pelvic floor , physiology urination , urinary incontinence , behavioral modification bladder training , dietary impact bladder function , performance pelvic floor muscle exercise . The exercise class emphasis pelvic floor exercise , core exercise , general body conditioning . 8 . An external internal pelvic floor muscle examination perform intervention , prior discharge next level care . 9 . All intervention perform patient hospital , follow-up visit require . 10 . Participants compensate study . Recruitment 1 . Staff nurse , resident physician , attend physician , nurse practitioner , physical occupational therapist inform investigator patient self-reports incontinence woman admit 4th floor nursing unit initial evaluation time stay . 2 . The staff member explain study woman , ask study investigator could come discuss possibility enrol study . 3 . The investigator approach every woman refer study explain study detail . Participants ask sign consent form agree participate allow collection personal health information . Ample time allow read answer question . 4 . After consent gather , investigator determine subject fit inclusion/exclusion criterion . 5 . Subject notified investigator finding within 1 day talk investigator confirmation exclusion enrollment . Analysis Following HIPPA guideline , patient identifiable data cod protect patient 's identity . The data obtain patient enter onto electronic teleforms import database . This RIC secure server access give project staff . We familiar use technology study . It efficient complete clinical setting minimize data entry error . The data use describe patient characteristic trend finding . We run descriptive analysis characterize patient study . We report percent patient indicate satisfied program . We compare pre-program post-program outcome use t-tests . Outcomes include : frequency severity incontinence , quality life , satisfaction intervention , FIM bladder score . Analyses conduct use SPSS version 20 . Outcome Measures Frequency severity Incontinence : We measure concept use FIM data patient 's medical chart note number accident report 24 hour time frame . The severity incontinence measure Sandvick 's severity index , valid measure score severity urinary incontinence woman . Quality Life : The quality life subject test use International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaireâ€”Short Form ( ICIQ-SF ) Satisfaction : A satisfaction survey develop Principal Investigator use understand subject 's satisfaction program . Data Collection Time point Data collect 2 separate time point . Data collect initially upon consent study prior subject discharge next level care . Data Collection Format Personal Health Information collect investigator review subject 's medical chart subjective interview consent participate receive .
