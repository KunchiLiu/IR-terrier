	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) condition refers narrow small blood vessel supply blood oxygen heart . It common cause chest-pain relate symptom result 'heart attack ' . In case , assess severity disease use coronary angiography , medical imaging technique use contrast ( dye ) x-ray show blood-flow supply coronary artery . The optimal treatment patient symptomatic coronary disease aggressive medical therapy . Current guideline recommend patient symptomatic CAD severe disease angiography undergo revascularisation therapy , aim restore blood flow block artery . This do either percutaneous coronary intervention ( feed small balloon device thin tube blood vessel point blockage inflate balloon open artery ) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( open-heart surgery ) 2 . For many symptomatic patient moderate disease angiography , functional testing require assess extent blockage . This achieve placing pressure wire artery interest , determine likelihood blockage impedes oxygen delivery heart muscle , know Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) 3 . FFR commonly perform Alfred hospital assessment patient . During FFR procedure , information regard health small artery heart obtain calculation index micro-vascular resistance ( IMR ) , Giving oxygen patient CAD common clinical practice , especially patient catheterisation laboratory whose 'heart attack ' often administer concurrently light sedation elective procedure . Recently , however , safety routine supplemental oxygen patient CAD questioned5 . A research study analyse outcome three small randomise study oxygen patient experienced 'heart attack ' , suggestive harm , finding study remain inconclusive . There may also deleterious effect supplemental oxygen , stable patient CAD , experience 'heart attack ' . Supplemental oxygen administer catheterisation laboratory patient stable CAD , show significantly reduce coronary artery blood flow increase resistance6-8 . It also show reduce cardiac output effect relaxation phase heart cycle . Based data hypothesise supplemental oxygen may affect FFR patient moderate CAD . The investigator therefore propose undertake study effect supplemental oxygen FFR patient moderate CAD . The patient enrol study schedule elective normal contrast diagnostic interventional procedure part clinically-indicated care . Once moderate blockage artery identify , FFR IMR measure . During first phase FFR study , patient breathe room air blood test measure oxygen level ( blood gas ) . There 3 minute washout period , follow second phase , whereby patient give 100 % oxygen 10 minute another blood gas measure . The study conduct Alfred Hospital total enrollment 18 subject . The estimated time complete enrollment 6-10 month . Data collect patient include demographic , medical history , vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , height , weight ) , usage cardiovascular medication , pathology result procedural record . Any adverse event serious adverse event relate study procedure also record .</brief_summary>
