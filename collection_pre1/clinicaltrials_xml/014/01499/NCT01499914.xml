	<detailed_description>Main objective : To investigate clinical efficacy pandemic influenza vaccine ( H1N1 ) v patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) Secondary objective : Vaccine research - Measure adherence population pandemic influenza vaccination - Measure tolerance pandemic influenza vaccine ( H1N1 ) v - Study immunogenicity vaccine H1N1 variant factor associate vaccine response Epidemiological clinical study : - Describe incidence asymptomatic form influenza A ( H1N1 ) among unvaccinated identify factor associate occurrence form patient cystic fibrosis - Describe impact influenza A ( H1N1 ) vaccinate unvaccinated - Characterizing clinical expression influenza pandemic period vaccinate unvaccinated identify factor associate occurrence severe form patient cystic fibrosis - Characterize serological response patient prove H1N1 - Characterize impact influenza A ( H1N1 ) lung disease patient short medium term Virological study : - Description epidemiology respiratory virus intracellular bacteria involve influenza-like illness - In-context H1N1 infection : - Study co-infections intracellular bacteria viral - Quantification viral RNA respiratory secretion - Monitoring kinetics viral shed correlation severity respiratory disease immunological protection - Sensitivity analysis viral strain antiviral drug search potential selection resistant strain antiviral therapy Genomic study : Search susceptibility gene increase risk : - A severe form - A prolonged viral shedding ( beyond day 10 ) , include research polymorphism carboxylesterase 1 - A immunoprotection Methodology : Prospective , multicenter , nonrandomized . Multicenter prospective cohort approximately 1000 CF patient follow Ile de France 2009-2010 influenza season - All patient CF follow Ile de France two transplant center ( IDF service Thoracic Surgery European Hospital Georges Pompidou Foch ) include much possible , 1000 patient ( 600 child ) . - 200 ( 100 child least 6 month , 100 adult ) participate study immunogenicity vaccination - 6 patient 12 year realize pharmacokinetic study Product consideration : Influenza vaccine ( H1N1 ) v pandemic administer . It mainly adjuvanted vaccine also un-adjuvanted vaccine subject risk : infant 6 23 month , pregnant woman , transplant . If flu symptom result PCR confirm refute diagnosis influenza , oseltamivir administer accordance official recommendation base result pharmacokinetic study . Criteria : Primary endpoint : vaccine efficacy To determine vaccine efficacy VE susceptibility , measure use complement 1 Hazard Ratio ( HR hazard ratio ) appearance influenza episode ( Halloran , AJE , 1997 ) . The existence effective vaccine test compare HR 1 . Using HR measurement prefer use ratio cumulative incidence rate among vaccinated unvaccinated change number group vaccinate / unvaccinated occur time . Indeed , immunization schedule include two dos give 3 week / 1 month apart , even appear antibody response achieve first half first dose . It possible subject may infect first dose first second , receive full presentation . On hand , date infection could similar vaccination , time efficiency optimal . In primary analysis , individual consider unvaccinated receive vaccination 15 day initial vaccination . For latter , time-dependent variable represent immunization status take account relative contribution period vaccinate / unvaccinated . The analysis stratify age group correspond quartile population . In secondary analysis , investigator vary initial term confer protection , investigator also consider receive full vaccination schedule , also determine impact use cumulative incidence rate vaccinate population initially ultimately vaccinate . Secondary endpoint : Membership vaccination measure proportion , together confidence interval 95 % , well incidence clinical influenza vaccinate unvaccinated cohort . The tolerance pandemic influenza vaccine ( H1N1 ) v evaluate binomial confidence interval . Individual factor lead decision vaccination immunization event determine logistic regression . The clinical expression describe percentage symptom onset . An analysis frequency symptom group vaccination carry . Factors related presence symptom seek use logistic regression . The percentage serious form measure . Vaccine efficacy serious measure use technique describe causal analysis Hudgens &amp; Halloran . The longitudinal lung function patient enrol analyzed data provide patient track software place service . A mixed effect linear model use analyze change respiratory function ( include FEV ) test whether infection accompany change current level functioning change evolution Compared situation pre-infection . The pan-genomic analysis evaluate SNPs ( Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ) associate presence ( 1 ) prolong infection , ( 2 ) immunoprotection , ( 3 ) infection , ( 4 ) severe infection . Some patient , correspond extreme form disease ( severe severe ) genotyped , whole cohort genotyped term . Each patient genotyped 300,000 SNPs . It generally accept association case `` genomically significant '' significance level small 10-7 . Actual calculation make project analysis modifier gene Pr Cl√©ment , result cohort , show comparison two cohort 500 subject , possible obtain significant result genomically difference 20 % frequency genotypes SNPs rare ( &gt; 5 % ) , risk factor ( FDR ) approximately 10 % . For analysis two group 150 subject , condition , FDR , however , close 1 . The staff compare two terminal , often unbalanced . It hop highlight difference genotype frequency , , order 20 % , case comparison involve entire cohort , investigator probably find imbalance large ( &gt; 50 % ) analysis small subgroup . In case , important try validate information independent study .</detailed_description>
