	<brief_summary>Rationale Currently , hepatic resection often curative treatment primary secondary hepatic malignancy also frequently perform patient benign liver tumor prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptom . Liver resection nowadays associate low mortality acceptable morbidity . As result , increase number patient currently consideration resection complex large tumor , thus require extensive resection procedure . Application vascular exclusion ( i.e. , clamp portal vein hepatic artery ) procedures reduces blood loss , one important factor affect peri-operative outcome . However , vascular exclusion lead ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury inevitable side-effect , adversely impact postoperative liver function regeneration . Additional cool liver mean hypothermic perfusion expect reduce intraoperative blood loss , well protect liver I/R injury . Therefore , aim pilot study cool future remnant liver ( FRL ) situ right hemihepatectomy vascular exclusion . Consequently , overall improvement postoperative outcome expect due decrease intraoperative blood loss , reduce parenchymal damage , good ability liver remnant regenerate . Objective To reduce intraoperative blood loss enhance tolerance FRL I/R injury right hemihepatectomy vascular exclusion mean situ hypothermic perfusion retrograde outflow ( R-IHP ) FRL . Study design The study design prospective randomize pilot study 18 patient ( 9 intervention 9 control ) ass effect propose intervention . Additionally , 4 patient include separately assessment intervention 's feasibility prior randomize inclusion . Study population Eligible patient participation study plan undergo right hemihepatectomy vascular inflow occlusion malignant benign liver tumor , suffer hepatic co-morbidity might influence postoperative outcome ( i.e. , severe steatosis , cholestasis , cirrhosis , hepatitis B/C infection ) . Intervention During right hemihepatectomy , FRL patient allocate intervention group perfuse chill perfusion solution ( i.e. , lactate Ringer 's solution ) .</brief_summary>
