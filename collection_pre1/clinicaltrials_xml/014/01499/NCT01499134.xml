	<brief_title>Comparison 2 Beta Blocker Drugs Peripheral Arterial Disease Patients With High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) affect estimate 16-29 % men woman age 50 , associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Beta-blockers show reduce risk myocardial infarction death patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) indicate treatment hypertension patient PAD . However , theoretical risk antihypertensive therapy may decrease limb perfusion pressure therefore exacerbate symptom claudication limb ischemia . Patients CAD concomitant PAD less likely prescribed beta-blockers , even though patient able tolerate antihypertensive therapy without worsen symptom . The third generation beta-blocker , nebivolol , vasodilating property addition beta-adrenergic blockade . This vasodilatory effect mediate L-arginine-nitric oxide-dependent pathway . Nitric oxide critical modulator vascular disease effect lead vasodilatation , endothelial regeneration , inhibition leukocyte chemotaxis inhibition platelet adhesion . This combination beta-blockade nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation may enhance effectiveness tolerability nebivolol versus beta-blockers patient hypertension , CAD high-risk state , PAD . This study pilot comparative effectiveness study examine effect nebivolol versus metoprolol succinate patient lower-extremity PAD least moderate risk CAD PAD symptom measure functional quality life measure .</detailed_description>
