	<brief_title>Clinical Study With Blinatumomab Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL adult patient aggressive malignant disease dismal prognosis . Several study report long term survival 10 % . Major prognostic factor duration first complete remission ( CR1 ) age . With current salvage chemotherapy , complete remission ( CR ) rate low ( 20 30 % ) patient first salvage short duration ( &lt; one year ) first remission , patient relapse first salvage , patient age 60 year old . Duration CR usually short ( median disease free survival [ DFS ] : 2.0-7.5 month ) . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) may provide curative treatment option patient CR satisfactory donor appropriate clinical status include age , organ function , remission status . Allogeneic HSCT option elderly patient relapse ALL . Additional therapeutic approach urgently need . Blinatumomab bispecific single-chain antibody derivative CD ( cluster differentiation ) 19 CD3 , design link B cell T cell result T cell activation cytotoxic T cell response CD19-expressing cell . In vitro data indicate CD19+ lymphoma leukemia cell line extremely sensitive blinatumomab-mediated cytotoxicity . Blinatumomab potential provide meaningful therapeutic benefit patient compare exist treatment patient population . This study consist screen period , treatment period follow-up period . Participants receive one five treatment cycle blinatumomab target dose 28 μg/day . In first cycle , initial dose 9 μg/day first seven day treatment , escalate 28 μg/day start Week 2 treatment . Participants achieve remission within two cycle treatment receive three additional cycle consolidation treatment proceed allogeneic HSCT . In event progression relapse within treatment period , treatment terminate . Participants hematological relapse efficacy safety follow-up period may receive three additional cycle blinatumomab ( retreatment ) maximal total eight cycle investigator´s discretion . Thirty day end last treatment , participant end-of-core-study visit . Following , efficacy follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month treatment start . Once efficacy follow-up complete , information survival collect least every six month death least three year treatment start , whichever occur early ( survival follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
