	<brief_title>Study MK 2206 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) frequent subtype Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) around world , age group . DLBCL curable disease combination monoclonal antibody CD20 ( rituximab ) cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisolone ( CHOP ) regimen improve prognosis patient 20 % increase cure rate . For remain patient complete response and/or relapse first line therapy , possibility cure dramatically reduce . As PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulate expression cyclin D1 , c-Myc Stat3 protein , involve pathogenesis DLBCL HL ) , signal axis emerge therapeutic target treatment DLBCL . One study show level p-Akt adverse prognostic feature DLBCL find 52 % tumor sample DLBCL patient . Given fact AKT overactivated 52 % DLBCL consider poor prognosis factor , postulate target AKT DLBCL may interest therapeutic strategy . MK-2206 orally selective allosteric inhibitor AKT develop MERCK currently highlight promising therapeutic option cancer patient clinical development several Phase 1 trial . Therefore , propose conduct Phase II study use two-stage Simon 's design objective response rate ( ORR ) primary endpoint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm diffuse large BCell lymphoma . Patients must measurable disease . Subjects must receive least two prior treatment lines.There maximal limit number prior therapy Prior treatment must include CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisolone ) like chemotherapy combination rituximab . Rituximab use alone consider separate regimen . Prior treatment could include high dose chemotherapy autologous stemcell transplantation patient progress ≥ 3 month treatment . Salvage treatment , mobilization chemotherapy , highdose chemotherapy plan posttransplant therapy consider one regimen Relapsed refractory patient candidate highdose chemotherapy autologous allogenic stem cell transplantation eligible . Patients must discontinue prior therapy least 5 time t1/2 prior anticancer therapy study entry . Male female patient , age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy great 4 month . ECOG performance status ≤2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ≥75 x 109/L bone marrow involve , AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤ 5.0 x ULN liver metastasis ) direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5ULN Calculated creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) ≥ 50mL/min Patients must agree use adequate double contraception Patients must able swallow whole tablet . Cardiovascular baseline QTcF≤ 450 msec ( male ) QTcF≤470msec ( female ) . Signed write informed consent document . Patients French Social Security compliance French law relate biomedical research . Tumor tissue sample available pathological review . Patients others Diffuse large BCell Lymphoma histology . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . Patients recover adverse event grade &gt; 1 due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know CNS involvement exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound compliance study protocol . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition MK2206 tablet . Patients uncontrolled hyperglycemia Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction MK2206 . Patients malabsorption syndrome condition would interfere intestinal absorption . Patients clinically important history liver disease , include viral hepatitis cirrhosis . Prior history malignancy lymphoma ( except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix breast ) unless subject free disease ≥ 3 year . Uncontrolled hypertension rest SBP &gt; 140 rest DBP &gt; 90mm Hg</criteria>
