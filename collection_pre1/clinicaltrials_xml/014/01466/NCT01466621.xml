	<brief_summary>The present proposal design investigate response CRT patient previously pace right ventricle ( RV ) . The negative physiologic structural change associate chronic RV pace well document , patient response follow upgrade CRT chronic RV pace well characterize large cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Previously Right Ventricular Paced Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The RV apex historically use site ventricular pacing case sinus node dysfunction atrioventricular block relatively accessible location lead implantation . Initial study show RV pace improve symptom , exercise capacity , quality life , survival patients.11-13 However , recent study illustrate chronic RV pacing may actually impair LV systolic function increase risk heart failure , hospitalization , death patient . The primary hypothesis patient upgrade CRT RV pacemaker respond well receive CRT first time device . To test hypothesis investigator compare change cardiac size function , hospitalization survival rate two patient group . The second hypothesis investigate whether change septal dyssynchrony correlate change ejection fraction previously RV pace patient . The investigator believe patient improvement septal dyssynchrony due RV pace see great improvement LV function follow upgrade CRT . A significant correlation change IM-S change EF support hypothesis .</detailed_description>
