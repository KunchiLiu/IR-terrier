Outpatients diagnosis psoriasis vulgaris lesion locate arm , leg and/or trunk . The lesion must total size suitable application 7 different product . Subjects , opinion investigator , stable psoriasis base Total Plaque Score evaluate screen visit visit 2 ( Baseline ) . Subjects psoriasis lesion ( plaque ) assess Total Clinical Score ( sum score erythema , scale infiltration ) 4 9 inclusive individual item ≥ 1 . Subjects willing able follow study procedure complete whole study . Subjects affiliate social security system . Female subject childbearing potential use reliable method contraception least 1 month study start course study ( e.g. , oral contraceptive pill , intrauterine device , contraceptive patch , implantable contraception , condom ) female non childbearing potential ( i.e . postmenopausal ( absence menstrual bleeding 2 year ) , hysterectomy , bilateral ovariectomy tubal section/ligation ) . Female negative urine pregnancy test Visit 1 ( screen visit ) . Females pregnant , childbearing potential wish become pregnant study , breast feeding . Systemic treatment biological therapy ( market market ) possible effect psoriasis vulgaris within 4 week ( etanercept ) , 2 month ( adalimumab , alefacept , infliximab ) , 4 month ( ustekinumab ) 4 weeks/5 halflives ( whichever longer ) experimental biological product prior randomisation study . Systemic treatment therapy biologicals , potential effect psoriasis vulgaris ( e.g. , corticosteroid , retinoids , immunosuppressant ) within 4week period prior randomisation study . Use phototherapy within follow time period prior randomisation study : PUVA ( 4 week ) , UVB ( 2 week ) . Subjects use one follow topical drug treatment psoriasis within 4 week period prior randomisation study : Potent potent ( WHO group IIIIV ) corticosteroid . Subjects use one follow topical drug treatment psoriasis within two week prior randomisation study : WHO group III corticosteroid ( except use treatment scalp and/or facial psoriasis ) , Topical retinoids , Vitamin D analogue , Topical immunomodulators ( e.g . macrolides ) , Anthracen derivative , Tar , Salicylic acid . Subjects use emollient target plaque within one week randomisation study . Initiation , expect change concomitant medication may affect psoriasis vulgaris ( e.g. , beta blocker , antimalaria drug , lithium ACE inhibitor ) within 2 week prior randomisation study . Subjects current diagnosis guttate , erythrodermic , exfoliative pustular psoriasis . Subjects known/suspected disorder calcium metabolism associate hypercalcemia within last 10 year , base medical history and/or subject interview . Subjects follow condition present test area : viral ( e.g . herpes varicella ) lesion skin , fungal bacterial skin infection , parasitic infection atrophic skin . Subjects skin manifestation relation syphilis tuberculosis , rosacea , perioral dermatitis , acne vulgaris , atrophic skin , stria atrophicae , fragility skin vein , ichthyosis , acne rosacea , ulcer wound within plaque test area . History severe disease serious current condition ( base subject interview and/or result screen physical examination ) , opinion Investigator , would put subject risk participating study would interfere significantly evaluation study result study course ( e.g . cancer , severe cardiopathy , severe renal insufficiency , severe hepatic insufficiency ) . Subjects receive treatment nonmarketed drug substance ( i.e. , agent yet make available clinical use follow registration ) within 4 week period prior randomisation longer , class substance require long washout define ( e.g. , biological treatment ) . Subjects current participation interventional clinical trial , base interview subject . Subjects know suspected hypersensitivity component ( ) investigational product ( ) . Subjects concomitant medical dermatological disorder ( ) might preclude accurate evaluation psoriasis test area . Subjects foresee intensive solar exposure study ( UV radiation , etc . ) expose within two week precede screen visit . Subjects impossible contact case emergency . Subjects know , opinion investigator , unlikely comply Clinical Study Protocol ( e.g . alcoholism , drug dependency psychotic state ) . Subjects exclusion period National Biomedical Research Register French Ministry Health randomisation .
