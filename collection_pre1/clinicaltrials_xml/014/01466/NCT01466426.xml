	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim validate 18F-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) detection characterization venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) entire human body , especially deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . On completion study investigator hopefully able demonstrate importance functional/molecular imaging technique manage patient common potentially fatal disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role FDG-PET/CT Imaging Management Patients With Thromboembolic Disorders ( The PETVET Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute DVT PE common serious condition . Highly effective treatment ( often anticoagulant agent ) available acute VTE , associate potentially dangerous side effect . In addition , DVT PE two manifestation VTE , occur everywhere human organism . An underlying disease ( i.e . cancer ) often key factor develop VTE . Commonly use diagnostic imaging technique DVT PE fair diagnostic accuracy , address important aspect disease . In contrast , FDG-PET/CT potential contribute VTE diagnosis - Differentiate acute chronic VTE - Screening entire body VTE ( e.g . pelvis normal image technique fail ) - Early diagnosis underlie disease ( e.g . cancer , possibility early treatment ) This pilot study mention objective , part large study address aspect FDG-PET/CT VTE . The investigator believe hypothesis FDG-PET/CT imaging may introduce new approach detect thrombus anywhere body , particularly venous system include pelvis calf , add new dimension treat patient suspect PE . This technology detect acute thrombus chronic thrombus longer activity , obviate unnecessary treatment population .</detailed_description>
