	<brief_summary>This study do see whether rifaximin , antibiotic work intestine , low amount germ intestines HIV infected person . It possible amount germ lower , HIV-infected person 's immune system become less active good chance recovering . Also , study evaluate safety use rifaximin HIV-infected subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rifaximin Modulator Microbial Translocation Immune Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A5286 randomize , open-label , two-arm , pilot ( phase II ) study evaluate whether 4 week treatment rifaximin , non-absorbable antibiotic , decrease marker immune activation level translocate gut microbial product HIV-1 infected subject virally suppress ART CD4+ T-cells &lt; 350 cells/mm^3 . Rifaximin admistered subject 3 week . Follow-up continue week 12 . The total sample size 73 subject . Subjects randomize 2:1 ratio ( rifaximin : study treatment ) , use permuted block , without institutional balancing . Subjects see week 12 clinical laboratory evaluation , include plasma HIV-1 RNA , CD4+ T-cell count , safety laboratory . Subjects 2 baseline visit -- pre-entry entry . Study visit schedule week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . CD4+ T-cell count HIV-1 RNA measure week ; measure activation , gut-homing marker , soluble biomarkers also perform week .</detailed_description>

( A single CD4+ cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 permit within 96 week prior study entry subject ART . ) Documentation HIV1 RNA limit detection ( e.g. , &lt; 50 copies/mL Roche Amplicor HIV1 Monitor assay , &lt; 75 copies/mL Versant HIV1 RNA assay branch DNA , &lt; 400 copies/mL standard Roche Amplicor assay , &lt; 40 copies/mL Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt realtime PCR test , &lt; 48 copies/mL COBAS AmpliPrep/TAQMAN HIV1 assay ) verify least two measurement prior study entry , one must least 48 week prior study entry one measurement obtain 121 day 48 week prior study entry . Screening HIV1 RNA limit detection obtain within 120 day prior study entry use FDA approve assay ( e.g. , &lt; 50 copies/mL Roche Amplicor HIV1 Monitor assay , &lt; 75 copies/mL Versant HIV1 RNA assay branch DNA , &lt; 40 copies/mL Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt realtime PCR test , &lt; 48 copies/mL COBAS AmpliPrep/TAQMAN HIV1 assay ) . ( The virologic assay must lower limit detection ≤ 75 copies/mL . ) All plasma HIV1 RNA measurements 48 week prior study entry must limit detection . ( A single detectable measurement ≤ 200 copies/mL permit RNA level immediately limit detection assay . ) Certain fast laboratory value obtain within 45 day prior entry indicated Section 4.1.9 protocol . Preentry peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) specimen assay primary immune activation endpoint ( change CD8+ Tcells activation ( % HLADR+CD38+CD8+ Tcells ) obtain . Sites must receive confirmation processing lab via phone , email , fax , specimen enter ACTG 's Laboratory Data Management System ( LDMS ) . Female subject reproductive potential must negative serum urine βHCG pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL perform within 24 hour prior study entry .
