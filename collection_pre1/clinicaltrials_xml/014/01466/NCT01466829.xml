	<brief_title>Treatment With PTH After Sternotomy Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart surgery commonly perform central division sternum , sternotomy . This procedure provide full overview thoracic cavity access organ within . At department Cardiothoracic &amp; Vascular Surgery Skejby Hospital alone , 1000 sternotomies perform year . When close sternum , normal procedure use steel wire hold two sternal half together . The patient receive additional medical treatment improve bone healing . Following surgery , sufficient heal sternum important prevent complication ensure high level life-quality patient . It show force , equally produce normal cough , displace wire-fixated sternum 2 mm . Reduced stability sternum negative impact heal process increase risk infection . Another know complication sternotomy pseudoarthrosis ( nonunion ) , cause insufficient heal sternum may result instability , chronic pain reduce quality life . These complication result prolonged admittance time , increase mortality morbidity financial point view , increase treatment-costs patient . Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) well know anabolic drug use treat osteoporosis post-menopausal woman great effect . A continuous high level PTH decrease bone density induces hypercalcemia , give daily PTH anabolic effect bone . It investigate possible use PTH treatment condition , example treatment bone fracture . Several study , clinical experimental , show PTH advance heal time increase quality newly form bone . It also show enable heal sternal nonunion one case-study . A recent human study 102 osteoporotic woman , fracture radial bone , show daily injection 20Âµg PTH-analog PTH1-34 ( Teriparatide ) reduce fracture healing time . The effect PTH bone heal sternum sternotomy previously investigate . In study , aim investigate effect PTH sternal heal clinical setup .</detailed_description>
