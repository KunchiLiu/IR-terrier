	<brief_title>Reversing Hormone Resistance Advanced Breast Cancer With Pazopanib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In trial , investigator propose evaluate role VEGFR blockade tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib combination nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor ( NSAI ) patient progress relapsed NSAI hormone therapy give advance early stage breast cancer . If trial demonstrate clinical benefit , oral combination could test neoadjuvant metastatic setting randomize phase II design . In order investigate potential factor predict response resistance pazopanib NSAIs , several translational study incorporate trial . The prognostic value circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) demonstrate several study breast cancer , especially advanced stage [ 35-38 ] . At UCSF laboratory Dr. John Park , investigator demonstrate expertise measurement CTC patient advance stage breast cancer IC/FC assay . CTC first enrich immunomagnetic bead coat EpCAM , EpCAM+ , CD45- , nucleic acid+ cell detect flow cytometry . This technique highly sensitive reproducable , allow sort cell molecular analysis well analysis cell surface marker [ 39 ] . In trial , investigator collect patient 's peripheral blood sample every 4 week treatment follow reduction CTC . The mechanisms hormonal resistance include intrinsic acquire pathway : decrease ER expression account intrinsic resistance increase receptor tyrosine kinase pathway relates acquire resistance [ 40-42 ] . The investigator plan analyze mutation PI3K/Akt deletion PTEN sequence CTC ( depend number cell , turn determines feasibility ) , order make preliminary assessment potential marker response pazopanib . The tumor microenvironment play important role cancer development progression . Clinical study reveal increased T regulatory cell ( Treg ) , high ratio CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes , extra follicular B cell primary tumor correlate bad overall survival [ 43-45 ] . Recently , study preclinical model show tumor associate macrophage ( TAM ) promote pulmonary metastasis breast cancer animal model , preclinical clinical setting associate bad clinical outcome [ 46-48 ] . TGFβ link hormonal resistance breast cancer . The activation TGFβ lead increase regulatory CD4+ T cell decrease cytotoxic CD8+ T cell tumor microenvironment [ 49 ] . A recent study non-small cell lung cancer suggest baseline post-treatment level cytokine , particularly IL-4 IL-12 correlate response pazopanib [ 50 ] . In study , investigator collect patient 's serum monitor level cytokine baseline treatment , investigator compare change cytokine level pazopanib patient , also compare responder non-responders . This information may help u identify biomarkers would predict response antiangiogenic therapy identify possible mechanism resistance .</detailed_description>
