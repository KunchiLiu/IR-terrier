	<brief_summary>Ronacaleret orally administer CaSR antagonist previously demonstrate transiently increase PTH animal human . Additional study post-menopausal woman patient distal radial fracture demonstrate anabolic catabolic effect bone biomarkers scan bone density . Based ronacalerets ability interact CaSR induce PTH release activate endogenous bone metabolism osteoblasts osteoclast , intention evaluate impact activation pathway mobilization Hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) periphery . This adaptive , phase I , randomize , single centre , double-blind dose finding , parallel-group , multi-cohort placebo control study efficacy safety ronacaleret 45 healthy human volunteer . Cohorts eligible subject study period 28 day . Total daily dos ronacaleret range 100mg , 400mg administer maximum 28days . The first part study evaluate several dos schedule ronacaleret , run parallel , respect ability affect mobilization CD34+ cell peripheral circulation . In subsequent cohort study utilize information obtain previous cohort refine optimise dose paradigm show efficacy . For first cohort study participant ; study commence 6 day dose inpatient setting follow 21 day continue dose evaluation outpatient , series regularly schedule visit , final visit day 28 . The study period include evaluation pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter along standard laboratory safety evaluation . The second cohort may treat ronacaleret period range 14 28 day order optimise treatment paradigm respect pharmacodynamic efficacy . The PK/PD group cohort one utilized make adjustment total daily dose , dose frequency duration dose investigated cohort 2 . Decisions make drop dos base PK/PD result safety consideration . An initial equal randomization amongst group within first cohort may adjust allow randomization strategy various dos schedule assess . The objective study characterise dose-response curve ronacaleret respect safety efficacy base change peripheral CD34+ cell count . Results obtain study inform u : optimized dos , schedule , duration treatment future study . Additional cohort may add explore dose schedule duration require . The exact number cohort study depend result obtain prior group desire explore variety dos schedule . The aims present study ( CR9115166 ) include assessment pharmacodynamic effect ( mobilization CD34+ cell ) , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ronacaleret healthy human volunteer .</brief_summary>
