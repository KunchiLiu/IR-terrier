	<brief_title>Comorbidity Aging With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard use combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) result major sustained decline HIV-associated morbidity mortality . Nonetheless , life expectancy patient HIV cART still remain 10 year shorter uninfected person age , especially patient start cART time infection already advance . A great risk broad range co-morbidities , experience many 60 % patient , even adjustment age , may contribute discrepancy . Several study demonstrate increased incidence heart disease , diabetes mellitus , kidney disease , liver disease , osteoporosis , malignancy ( Kaposi 's sarcoma non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma traditionally associate HIV ) , cognitive disorder possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease HIV-infected individual compare age match HIV-uninfected control . Of note , incidence mention co-morbidities also high adjustment age traditional risk factor . Most study conduct United States prevalence risk factor various co-morbidities may different Europe , particular Netherlands . HIV-related factor adverse effect cART may independently contribute observe increase risk several earlier mention co-morbidities . Interestingly , HIV-infected men absence cART increase frailty ( clinical syndrome associate age identifies subset old adult high risk mortality adverse outcome ) compare uninfected men similar age . Middle age HIV-infected men despite cART use also show reduction exercise capacity , functional performance , physical activity , grip strength . The multidisciplinary expertise regard co-morbidities present within AMC close collaboration exist data collection structure HIV Monitoring Foundation ( HMF ) Cluster Infectious Diseases Public Health Service Amsterdam ( PHSA ) , offer unique opportunity systematically identify burden co-morbidity , ( know ) risk factor effect quality life among HIV-infected individual comparable group uninfected individual .</detailed_description>
