	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety tolerability profile include dose limiting toxicity AbGn-7 patient chemo-refractory advanced solid tumor epithelial origin , AbGn-7 combination FOLFOX7 patient chemo-naive/chemo-refractory recurrent , locally advanced metastatic gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An A/B Dose Escalation Study AbGn-7 Alone With FOLFOX7 Treatment Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monoclonal antibody , alone combination chemotherapeutic agent , proven effective treatment many malignant disease human . Antibodies mediate cytotoxicity complement dependent cytotoxicty ( CDC ) , antibody dependent cell mediate cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) apoptosis . AbGn-7 identify base direct killing ( apoptosis-inducing ) activity towards cancer cell express epitope . In vitro data also demonstrate ability elicit CDC ADCC . The vivo xenograft study AbGn-7 demonstrate AbGn-7 alone combination chemotherapeutic agent successfully suppress growth gastric , pancreatic , colorectal tumour . The NHP study prove safety profile AbGn-7 . The present Phase 1 clinical study design evaluate safety tolerability AbGn-7 alone patient solid tumor epithelial origin ( Phase 1a ) combination current chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFOX7 patient recurrent , locally advanced metastatic gastric carcinoma ( Phase 1b ) .</detailed_description>
