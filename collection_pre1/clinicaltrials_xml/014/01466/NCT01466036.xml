	<brief_summary>Cabozantinib work block growth new blood vessel fee tumor . In addition block formation new blood cell tumor , cabozantinib also block pathway may responsible allow cancer cell become resistant `` anti-angiogenic '' drug . Cabozantinib study study research study possible treatment various type cancer , include prostate cancer , brain cancer , thyroid cancer , lung cancer , kidney cancer . In research study , investigator wish learn cabozantinib effective treating patient pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects take cabozantinib orally , per day , cycle 28 day . During cycle subject follow procedure : - Physical examination , include measurement weight vital sign - Questions regard side effect - Blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) routine laboratory test blood cell count , blood chemistry , organ function blood clot - Blood sample ( 4 tablespoon ) research test measure biomarkers assess response study drug - Urine sample routine urine test monitor health On Day 15 ( begin week 3 ) first 3 cycle : - Physical examination , include measurement weight vital sign - Questions regard side effect - Blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) routine laboratory test blood cell count , blood chemistry , organ function blood clot - Blood sample ( 4 tablespoon ) research test measure biomarkers assess response study drug Subjects receive CT scan MRI every two cycle ( every two month ) evaluate disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally unresectable metastatic , histologicallyconfirmed , carcinoid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . Tumors must consider well moderatelydifferentiated . Patients poorly differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma cell carcinoma exclude study . A tumor sample require enrollment ( except patient diagnose &gt; 7 year ago ) . Must measurable disease RECIST criterion Must evidence progressive disease within 12 month study entry Prior concurrent therapy somatostatin analog permit . If somatostatin/octreotide , must stable dose least two month . Age ≥ 18 year No major surgery radiation prior 4 week prior enrollment No prior therapy cabozantinib ECOG Performance status ≤ 1 Participants must adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5X normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; /=2.5x normal institutional limit , &lt; 5x liver metastasis present Creatinine &lt; /= 1.5x normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 50mL/min Urine Protein : Creatinine ratio &lt; 1 Lipase &lt; 1.5X upper limit normal Serum Albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dl Sexually active subject must agree use medically accept method birth control course study 3 month follow discontinuation study treatment ( exclude woman child bear potential men sterilize ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Subjects receive standard investigational anticancer agent , exception somatostatin/octreotide therapy . If patient receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy , must least three week since last treatment first dose study treatment . Major surgery radiation treatment &lt; 4 week prior enrollment . In addition , receive radiation thorax gastrointestinal tract within three month first dose study treatment . Can receive radionuclide treatment within 6 week first dose study treatment . High grade poorly differentiate neuroendocrine tumor Ongoing immunosuppression systemic steroid immune modulator Presence CNS metastatic disease Uncontrolled hypertension define SBP &gt; 140 DBP &gt; 90 despite titration anti hypertensive medication No uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia chronic atrial fibrillation , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Congestive heart failure symptomatic coronary artery disease within 3 month prior enrollment Cerebrovascular accident within prior 6 month The subject history clinically significant hematemesis recent history hemoptysis &gt; 2.5 mL red blood sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage evidence endobronchial lesion ( ) . The subject pulmonary lesion abut encase major blood vessel . Previous history pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis The subject require concomitant treatment , therapeutic dos , anticoagulant warfarin Coumadinrelated agent , heparin , thrombin FXa inhibitor , antiplatelet agent ( eg , clopidogrel ) . Low dose aspirin ( ≤ 81 mg/day ) , lowdose warfarin ( ≤ 1 mg/day ) , prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin ( LMWH ) permit . At time screening , active peptic ulcer disease active inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis , appendicitis . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , bowel obstruction , gastric outlet obstruction , intraabdominal abscess within six month study enrollment . History GI surgery within past 28 day . If &gt; 28 day since GI surgery , must confirmation complete heal initiate treatment study drug . Other disorder associate high risk fistula formation , include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy concurrent evidence intraluminal tumor involve trachea esophagus . Other clinically significant disorder : Active infection require systemic treatment Serious nonhealing wound/ulcer/bone fracture History organ transplant Concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism thyroid dysfunction History major surgery within 4 week minor surgical procedure within one week randomization The subject correct QT interval calculate Fridericia formula &gt; 500ms within 28 day randomization . Severely impaired lung function Concurrent malignancy ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past 3 year currently active malignancy Pregnant woman exclude study due potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother treatment protocol , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol .</criteria>
