	<detailed_description>Working memory deficit central cognitive impairment schizophrenia psychiatric disorder . The D1 receptor ( D1R ) probably best establish mediator work memory neuroscience study three decade represent highly promising therapeutic target enhance work memory disorder , yet mechanism never test human . Schizotypal personality disorder ( SPD ) patient evidence moderate , focal impairment work memory represent unique population test effect D1 agonist work memory impairment human . Cognitive impairment salient predictor functional outcome schizophrenia ( SCZ ) essentially refractory conventional treatment . Identifying pharmacologic agent target cognitive deficit SCZ thus top priority SCZ research , far , clinical trial number drug preclinical promise yield disappointing result . Currently , study date directly test selective D1R agonist relation cognitive impairment SCZ without confound neuroleptic . The investigator propose examine efficacy DAR-0100A , highly selective , full D1R agonist support pre-clinical preliminary pilot clinical data , ameliorate cognitive deficit SPD subject receive medication include antipsychotic . SPD classify schizophrenic disorder DSM-5 ICD-10 . The investigator characterize cognitive deficit SPD demonstrate , chronic SCZ , core component consist impairment work memory . Studies SPD obviate confounds associated SCZ , effect overt psychotic episode , medication history , severe , persistent functional impairment multiple treatment . Furthermore , cognitive deficit SPD less global readily reversible chronic SCZ , provide unique opportunity test D1 mechanism cognitive enhancement . DAR-0100A , active enantiomer dihydrexidine ( DHX ) , full D1R agonist a10-60 fold selectivity D2R . DHX administration improve cognition single dos young adult age monkey rodent . A single treatment DAR-0100A adult human SCZ demonstrate enhance prefrontal perfusion . Pilot data group Columbia suggest DAR-0100A improves cognitive performance , particularly work memory , schizophrenia spectrum . Primary Aims : 1 . To perform 5-year study three consecutive day DAR-0100A dose 15 mg placebo administer intravenously 30 minute 60 patient SPD ( 12/yr ) between-groups , randomize , double-blind design . Cognitive testing perform baseline ( Day 1 ) third day drug/placebo administration ( Day 4 ) . Subjects return Day 15 receive drug ( randomize initially placebo ) placebo ( randomized drug ) double blind fashion identical protocol . This allow patient receive drug Secondary Aim 1 maintain blind . Baseline ( Day 1 ) repeat cognitive testing ( Day 4 ) also administer 60 healthy control per year ( 12/yr ) . The cognitive test work memory serve primary outcome measure include modify AX-CPT ( ' ) , N-back ( % correct 2-back condition ) , DOT Task ( distance error 30 second delay - delay ) , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task ( PASAT ) ( correct response ) . The investigator also include test memory , executive function , verbal learning secondary outcome measure ( see Methods ) well comparison test hypothesize change drug : Benton line orientation test ( JLOT ) Trail Making Test A . 2 . To compare change primary outcome measure baseline Day 4 test drug placebo administration SPD subject . 3 . To compare primary outcome variable baseline change baseline Day 4 test patient group healthy control . 4 . To obtain plasma DHX concentration Day 4 evaluate plasma concentration relation cognitive change potential covariate . Secondary Aims : 1 . To evaluate change baseline Day 4 cognitive test SPD patient receive drug first second phase . 2 . To evaluate secondary outcome comparison variable SPD patient placebo drug . Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Baseline primary outcome measure impair SPD subject compare control . 2 . SPD subject DAR-0100A show improvement primary measure great healthy control SPD patient randomize placebo baseline Day 4 . 3 . SPD patient show significant improvement primary outcome variable drug compare placebo comparis¬on perceptual ( JLOT ) process speed/attentional task ( Trails A ) . It critical establish efficacy cognitive enhancement selective D1 agonist schizophrenic disorder cognitive impairment without concomitant neuroleptic treatment provide momentum effort . The readily reversible cognitive impairment SPD provide unique opportunity critical study D1 hypothesis pave way development severe schizophrenic disorder inevitable complicate artifact .</detailed_description>
