	<brief_summary>This project evaluate effect World Trade Center ( WTC ) exposure WTC responders 10-13 year follow event 9/11 . Prior study describe persistent pulmonary function abnormality significant portion responder . The investigator study seek examine relationship pulmonary function abnormality marker chronic cardiopulmonary disease elucidate pathophysiologic effect exposure inhale particulate matter ( PM ) 9/11 . This study provide critical information regard risk exposure PM , risk factor disease potential improvement diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Serious illness injury follow September 11 , 2001 ( 9/11 ) attack World Trade Center ( WTC ) affect thousand responder work WTC rescue recovery effort . During time , individual sustain exposure vast array environmental toxin physical hazard . The population survivor present unique opportunity rigorously examine effect inhale particulate matter risk persistent pulmonary chronic cardiopulmonary disease . Original report 9,500 WTC responder examine July 2002 April 2004 , note abnormal pulmonary function result one-third participant . Further study population demonstrate persistent change pulmonary function test 9 year exposure ( 2010 Annual Report 9/11 Health ) . Numerous complex interaction pulmonary cardiovascular system exist . In fact , molecular level , evidence support integral role reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) -dependent pathway instigation pulmonary oxidative stress , systemic pro-inflammatory response , vascular dysfunction atherosclerosis . Studies animal show inhalation particle lead weaken heart muscle . In addition , patient develop pulmonary disease inhalation particulate matter may develop increased pressure pulmonary artery , well dysfunction right ventricle heart . Finally , patient suffer blockage coronary artery may exhibit abnormality heart function may detect echocardiogram . Preliminary work group reveal echocardiographic evidence cardiac abnormality subset 1190 WTC responder . Diastolic dysfunction , impair ventricular relaxation , know accompany age associate hypertensive heart disease . In analysis subject &lt; 50 year age , BMI &lt; 30 , lack diagnosis hypertension , investigator find prevalence diastolic dysfunction 47 % . Importantly , population narrow exclude former current smoker , LV abnormality , 12 % abnormality RV diastolic function . The investigator propose analyze relationship pulmonary function abnormality evidence diastolic dysfunction . Persuasive data implicates obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) development hypertension , arrhythmia , vascular dysfunction cardiac disease . Webber et al demonstrate increased prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) among firefighter expose WTC disaster , group demonstrate similar prevalence screen positive OSA among 2500 law enforcement officer present Ground Zero . The relationship OSA risk cardiac disease involve similar pathophysiologic pathway include inflammation impair vascular reactivity . In addition traditional risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , study indicate exposure inhalation particulate matter ( PM ) contribute CV morbidity mortality . The 2010 American Heart Association Scientific Statement Particulate Matter Air Pollution Cardiovascular Disease provide compelling evidence increase risk due air pollution . Although exact mechanism PM cause toxic effect adequately understand , likely different mechanism responsible acute chronic effect . In addition , PM consist many different component , different component may affect CVD different mechanism , electrophysiologic change , inflammation , coagulation , endothelial cell function effect atherosclerosis . In summary , thousand WTC responder sustain exposure thousand ton coarse fine PM , cement dust , glass fiber , asbestos , lead , hydrochloric acid , polychlorinated biphenyls , organochlorine pesticide , polychlorinated dioxin furan . It unknown extent exposure PM modify risk develop atherosclerotic disease , addition pulmonary effect effect cardiac function .</detailed_description>
