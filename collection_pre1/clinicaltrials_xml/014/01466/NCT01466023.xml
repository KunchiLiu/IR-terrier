	<brief_summary>Transient hypothyroxinemia prematurity ( THOP ) typical entity preterm infant , affect majority preterm infant , bear less 30 week gestational age . It define temporary postnatal reduction cord value serum level T4 FT4 , normal thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels.The etiology THOP complex multifactorial . Loss maternal T4 , limit postnatal thermogenesis , hypothalamic-pituitary immaturity , limited thyroid gland reserve , persistent fetal thyroid hormone metabolism predisposition nonthyroidal illness syndrome several factor contribute less intensity THOP.The association THOP poor neurodevelopmental outcome well establish several therapeutic clinical trial set . However , currently evidence prophylactic therapeutic supplementation thyroxine ( T4 ) premature infant THOP . One study van Wassenaer et al . show beneficial effect treatment THOP subgroup preterm infant gestational age le 28 week , reverse effect group gestational age 29 week . This illustration limit comprehension pathophysiology THOP . Although study THOP usually involve preterm infant bear 33 week earlier , one study Paul et al . show decreased thyroid function late preterm term infant respiratory distress syndrome function severity illness . Unpublished data center show also presence THOP , although less frequent , group late preterm infant . Other data group preterm infant scarce . During first half pregnancy , fetus completely dependent maternal thyroid hormone supply fetal thyroid gland start thyroid hormone secretion 17-19 week gestational age . Conditions maternal ( sub ) clinical hypothyroidism associate complication like hypertension , preterm birth , low birth weight , placental abruption , fetal death . One wonder compensate mechanism placenta , provide fetus sufficient thyroid hormone case compromise thyroid supply . One study show total placenta deiodinase type 3 ( D3 ) activity pregnancy severely hypothyroid fetus significantly low euthyroid control . Two study show increased monocarboxylate transporter 8 ( MCT8 ) decrease MCT10 expression within placentae pregnancy complicate IUGR . As far know , nothing know possible compensating effect placentae mother subclinical hypothyroidism possible influence development THOP . Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism pregnancy predisposition development overt hypothyroidism . The influence maternal thyroid antibody pregnancy towards thyroid hormone function fetus consequently neurodevelopmental outcome still clear . One single study Negro et al . show euthyroid pregnant woman positive thyroid peroxidase antibody ( TPOAb ) develop impaired thyroid function , associate increase risk miscarriage premature delivery . They also show substitutive treatment levothyroxine ( LT4 ) able low chance miscarriage premature delivery.A study Pop et al . conclude child pregnant woman elevate titer TPO-Ab normal thyroid function risk impair development.Nothing know possible influence maternal thyroid antibody towards development THOP , although theoretical link possible . The investigator want investigate whether compensatory mechanism placentas premature bear infant whether maternal thyroid hormone condition prediction development THOP premature infant . The investigator want investigate difference several group preterm infant : 24-28 week , 28-32 week 32-36 week . The aim study investigate impact maternal thyroid hormone condition pregnancy neurodevelopmental outcome neonate . In Belgium , 8 % newborn born preterm . There 2000 delivery year University Hospitals Leuven . Between 2 5 % pregnant woman consider subclinical hypothyroidism preterm birth almost 2-fold high woman subclinical hypothyroidism.The incidence THOP 30 % . We perform statistical power calculation confidence level 95 % . Given data assumption 50 % premature baby bear hypothyroid mother develop THOP , need include 320 patient give premature birth obtain statistical power 80 % . Therefore , inclusion time 2 year .</brief_summary>
