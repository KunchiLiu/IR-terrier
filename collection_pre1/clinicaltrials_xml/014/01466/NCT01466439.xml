	<brief_summary>The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) recent technique demonstrate efficiency depression schizophrenia . However efficiency recognize scientific community clinician , action neuron cerebral network remain debated . In motor region , different rTMS study generally use frequency stimulation 1 40 Hz differential effect ; low frequency associate inhibitory effect whereas high frequency rather facilitator effect attest motor response . What valid motor system however necessarily applicable cerebral region different neuronal organization . If easy observe opposite effect rTMS motor system ( presence absence movement ) , potential effect integrate cortex involve high level function prove . One possibilities interpret effect rTMS no-motor cerebral region would study modification EEG rTMS see differential effect high low frequency stimulation exists . Up , study couple two technique observe modification brain electric activity second minute rTMS , appear contrast clinical effect observe long delay ( several day ) . The contribution research reside use paradigm suppression P50 evoke potential component rTMS test low high frequency stimulation . This paradigm consist two identical auditory stimulus present short interval ( generally 500 millisecond ) , second sound generate P50 wave weaker amplitude first completely abolish healthy subject . However , effect well study could result inhibitory action due gabaergic interneurons pyramidal neuron cortex . Thus , investigator hypothesize high frequency rTMS would facilitator effect temporal lobe would induce suppression P50 after-rTMS whereas low frequency rTMS would induce inhibitory effect mark great suppression P50 . Methods : 30 healthy subject ( 16 woman ) include write consent . They receive randomization 2 session rTMS cross 1Hz 20Hz 30 day interval . An EEG P50 evoke potential do rTMS . The site stimulation determine neuronavigation correspond maximal activation cluster generate language task functional magnetic resonance imaging . The main judgment criterion S2/S1 ratio P50 . The potential secondary effect evaluate ( UKU adapt ) . The secondary criterion comparison rTMS EEG spectrum alpha , beta gamma band .</brief_summary>
