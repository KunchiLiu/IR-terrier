	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) debilitating , progressive neurological disease characterize inflammation central nervous system ( CNS ) , result demyelination axonal damage ( review see [ Compston , 2008 ] ) . The clinical course ~85 % MS patient diagnosis relapse remitting ( RRMS ) form , characterize recurrent episodes neurological dysfunction ( relapse ) intersperse long period gradual improvement ( remission ) . Typical symptom RRMS include limb weakness , sensory disturbance visual impairment . Over time , disability accumulate 10 year approximately half RRMS patient suffer relapse show gradual progression disability , term secondary progressive ( SP ) MS [ Confavreuax , 2000 ] . Excess mortality due MS quality life improve rapid accurate diagnosis combine well complication management administration disease modify therapy [ Bronnum , 2006 ] . However , efficacious well tolerate medicine need relieve considerable social economic burden associate MS. Sphingosine 1 phosphate ( S1P ) endogenous ligand conserve family five G-protein couple receptor ( S1P receptor subtype 1 -5 ) , effective concentration ( EC50 ) range submicromolar nanomolar level [ Chun , 2002 ] . Validation therapeutic approach target S1P receptor autoimmune disease provide clinical development FTY720 MS ( fingolimod ; Novartis ) . GSK2018682 agonist recombinant human S1P1 activity S1P5 receptor display agonist activity towards human S1P2 , S1P3 S1P4 concentration 10 µM . This selectivity anticipate minimise know cardiovascular effect mediate S1P2/3 subtypes . Orally administer GSK2018682 effective murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , animal model human MS. GSK2018682 reasonably tolerate follow single oral dos 0.6mg 24mg ongoing study ( P1A114070 ) healthy volunteer STUDY RATIONALE : Two Phase I study ( P1A114070 &amp; P1A114347 ) conduct healthy volunteer use GSK2018682 capsule formulation . These capsule produce single batch compound ( second drug substance campaign , term CD2 ) particle size 15 µm ( D90 ) . In order support clinical development GSK2018682 , new batch ( CD3 ) compound synthesize slightly large particle size ( 29 µm , D90 ) . In addition , intend long term study ( Proof Concept beyond ) conduct tablet form drug . There also possibility obtain small particle size micronisation CD3 batch ( produce particle diameter approximately 3.8 µm , D90 ) may improve bioavailability ; tablet make micronized CD3 GSK2018682 also develop . In order ensure appropriate dose selection future study , need investigate pharmacokinetic profile new tablet form GSK2018682 ( manufacture CD3 campaign ) compare original ( CD2 ) capsule formulation . Therefore , study evaluate relative bioavailability single dose 3 different formulation ( CD2 capsule , CD3 tablet CD3 micronized tablet ) GSK2018682 cross , randomize , 4 period , open label design . The fourth treatment arm add examine effect food relative bioavailability CD3 tablet formulation . The study also measure effect dose form GSK2018682 total lymphocyte count . DOSE RATIONALE : A 2 mg dose use study : - PK well quantify dose . - Significant ( excess 100 % ) change PK parameter detectable . - PK level quantification 7 day dose . - S1P1-mediated PD effect lymphocytes heart rate detect . - There least 2 fold cover exposure PD effect lymphocytes heart rate . - It likely dose used future Phase II study ( give predict accumulation ratio exposure steady state ) . STUDY DESIGN : This study investigate single dos GSK2018682 cohort 16 healthy male female ( non-childbearing potential ) subject accord randomize , open-label , 4 way crossover design . The effect food pharmacokinetics CD3 tablet formulation explore likely used future Phase II study . Treatment regimens include : - CD2 Capsule - CD3 non-micronised Tablet - CD3 micronised Tablet - CD3 non-micronised Tablet fed condition</detailed_description>
