	<brief_title>Alisertib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate ( complete response + partial response ) treatment alisertib ( MLN8237 ) patient relapse refractory peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . II . To assess overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient population . III . To evaluate safety tolerability MLN8237 treatment patient population . IV . To explore association pre-treatment aurora kinase A expression tumor biopsy measure fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) objective response rate patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) treat MLN8237 . IV . To investigate copy number , mutational status , expression aurora kinase ( A , B , C ) associate signal pathway PTCL utilize tissue microarray analysis ( TMA ) treatment MLN8237 . V. To investigate change serum cytokine profile pre- post- aurora kinase Inhibitor treatment . VI . To evaluate serum marker apoptosis pre- post- aurora kinase inhibitor treatment pharmacodynamic marker efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
