	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect well give autologous T cell cyclophosphamide work treat patient soft tissue sarcoma metastatic remove surgery . Biological therapy , cellular adoptive immunotherapy , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving autologous T cell together cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous T Cells Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma That Metastatic Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility , safety toxicity treat patient NY-ESO-1 specific cellular adoptive immunotherapy myxoid/round cell liposarcoma ( MRCL ) synovial sarcoma patient receive autologous cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ NY-ESO-1 specific T cell follow cyclophosphamide conditioning . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor effect persistence adoptively transfer CD8+ antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) line follow cyclophosphamide conditioning . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -3 -2 . Patients receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cell IV day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week .</detailed_description>

patient treat PICCASSO trial progress allow study ; `` unresectable disease '' shall include patient locally advanced disease surgery could attempt surgery would mutilate , debilitate would likely fail result longterm disease free survival ; set patient might reasonably choose undergo salvage/second line systemic therapy could also pursue aggressive surgical option standard care Able tolerate highdose cyclophosphamide NYESO1 expression &gt; 25 % tumor immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ( least 2+ ) Expression human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) A0201 ; high resolution HLA typing perform experienced HLA lab accept Zubrod performance status '01 ' Patients metastatic disease must bidimensionally measurable disease palpation clinical exam , radiographic imaging ( compute tomography [ CT ] scan ) All patient must electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; patient must normal stress test within 182 day prior treatment Patients must already leukapheresed either protocol 1246 2365 prior entry study ; patient unable leukapheresis product collect , whatever reason , unable participate study If patient NYESO1 express sarcoma would otherwise eligible trial , disagreement pathologist regard histopathologic diagnosis , eligibility decide principal investigator ( PI ) Patients must NYESO1 specific cell already production ;
