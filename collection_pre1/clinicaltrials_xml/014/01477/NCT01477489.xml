	<brief_title>Veliparib With Radiation Therapy Patients With Inflammatory Loco-regionally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Veliparib investigational drug know `` PARP inhibitor . '' Because veliparib affect way cell repair damage , veliparib may useful combination radiation treatment may help make radiation work well . Veliparib oral medication take twice daily 6 week patient receive radiation therapy . The researcher also analyze blood tissue take skin patient . The skin biopsy help determine patient sensitive treatment radiation combine study drug . While blood sample allow researcher see way person 's body process drug affect patient responds treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm breast cancer either ) locoregional recurrence previous mastectomy b ) inflammatory breast cancer status post mastectomy radiotherapy chest wall regional node plan part treatment . Patients Stage IV disease eligible long meet criterion . Surgical resection disease willingness wait least three week surgery begin radiotherapy . Willingness discontinue cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , target therapy ( include trastuzumab ) least two week prior start radiotherapy . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 6 month . Adequate hematologic , renal hepatic function ( assess within two week prior registration within month prior commencement protocol treatment ) . Negative pregnancy test ( within two week prior registration ) woman childbearing potential ( define undergone surgical method sterilization menses within past year ) . Ability swallow retain oral medication . Willingness undergo three require skin punch biopsy research purpose . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Radiation therapy : Prior history radiation therapy chest wall and/or regional node allow ( prior radiation therapy sit permissible ) . Breast reconstruction : Patients undergone breast reconstruction procedure mastectomy exclude concern additional toxicity patient population . Gross residual tumor positive microscopic margin : Patients gross residual tumor positive microscopic margin eligible radiation dose study limit 60Gy . Ongoing therapy investigational agent : Patients may receive investigational agent . Unresolved toxicity agent : Patients unresolved unstable , CTCAE v4 Grade 3 great toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior anticancer treatment eligible . Significant comorbidity : Also ineligible patient clinically significant uncontrolled major cardiac , respiratory , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , hematologic neurological/psychiatric disease disorder , include limited : active uncontrolled infection ; symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ; illness condition ( ) could exacerbate potential toxicity , confound safety assessment , require exclude therapy management , limit compliance study requirement . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition veliparib . Concomitant antineoplastic treatment allow protocol treatment complete least 2 week prior commencement protocol treatment , resolution associate acute toxicity , except endocrine therapy bisphosphonates permit without restriction even protocol treatment . Pregnant woman exclude study radiation therapy teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother veliparib , breastfeed discontinue patient receives veliparib . Patients active seizure disorder history seizure , well patient CNS metastasis ( unless CNS metastases stable therapy &gt; 3 month patient steroid time study enrollment ) .</criteria>
