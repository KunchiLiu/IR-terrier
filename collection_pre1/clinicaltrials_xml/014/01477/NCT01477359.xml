	<brief_summary>Recent data show sarcoidosis , present initially cardiac manifestation ( CS ) either conduction system disease cardiomyopathy sustain VT , uncommon . A Canadian physician survey find physician investigate CS possibility situation . Thus many patient clinically important CS go un-diagnosed . A study Finland show miss diagnosis CS patient ' lead significant mortality morbidity . There publish clinical consensus guideline treatment CS . Corticosteroid therapy advocate expert . This base modest data small retrospective observational study use variable definition clinical response . The effect corticosteroid treatment clinical course CS study prospective study one aim project . Recent physician survey regard CS , Canada US , find current clinical practice varies widely . The 2008 American College Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm society guideline recommend implantation defibrillator ( Class IIa recommendation ) prevent sudden cardiac death . The recent Canadian device therapy guideline mention CS . A multi-center collaborative approach study CS greatly need . '' The investigator propose exactly i.e . multi-center prospective cohort start answer clinical question . The investigator form CANADIAN CARDIAC SARCOIDOSIS RESEARCH GROUP . The group include respirologists interest sarcoidosis , cardiac electrophysiologists , cardiac imaging specialist extensive experience image sarcoidosis biostatisticians . The research two phase current application Phase 1 ( pilot ) prospective cohort . Twenty Canadian center commit participate pilot study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Sarcoidosis Multi-Center Prospective Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline assessment Group A , B &amp; C patient consist : history , echocardiogram , ECG , PET +/- MRI scan ( ) QOL questionnaire . Follow-up clinical management Group A B patient diagnose CS occur 6 month : echocardiogram , ECG , QOL questionnaire , device interrogation PET scan . Further follow-up occur 12 , 24 36 month parameter measure 6 month except PET . The timeline follow Group C patient Groups A &amp; B however , device interrogation perform patient ICD implant . Based plan enrollment 400 patient , estimate 38-62 patient CS detail follow-up . It anticipate proportion treat steroids/immunosuppressants ( use treat physician discretion ) . The occurrence primary secondary outcome assess treat untreated patient . It suggest new imaging modality ( PET CMR ) may important utility guide therapy CS . FDG PET MRI maybe able detect early potentially reversible stage CS . There 2 image core lab . The PET core lab locate UOHI direction Dr. Robert Beanlands . The CMR core lab locate Montreal Heart Institute direction Dr. Mathias Friedrich . All scan read core lab physician blind clinical detail patient . All scan read within 24 hour receipt report give individual center allow clinical decision making .</detailed_description>
