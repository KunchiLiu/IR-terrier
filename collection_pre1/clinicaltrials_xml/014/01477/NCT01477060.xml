	<brief_summary>Target Population : female patient HER2-negative , ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer progression first-line hormonal therapy . The study rationale base potentiality reverse endocrine-resistance Lapatinib - Activity compensatory-adaptive mechanism hyperactivity signal generate HER2 family - Modulation energy balance signal associate survival AMPK activation ( via Calmodulin ) Metformin - Indirect mechanism , reduce insulin receptor IGFR stimulation , reduces proliferative effect downstream - Direct mechanism , AMPK activation ( via LKB1 ) , reduce protein synthesis ( mTOR inhibition ) increase availability intracellular energy Lapatinib Metformin - AMPK `` Double '' activation , different potentially additional mechanism . - Inhibition proliferative mechanism interference various intracellular target - IR ( A e/o B ) ; IGFR - EGFR ; HER2 Primary objective : 1 . To assess rate patient free disease progression 3 month randomization Secondary objective : 1 . To assess overall response rate 2 . To assess duration response 3 . To assess 3-years overall survival rate 4 . To assess tolerability propose treatment Female patient HER2-negative , ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer progression first-line hormonal therapy randomize receive : hormonal therapy + lapatinib hormonal therapy + metformin hormonal therapy + metformin + lapatinib ratio 1:1:1 . For arm study follow sample size require : - First step : 23 patient , total 69 patient 3 arm - Second step : 33 patient , total 168 patient 3 arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan Patient continue treat hormone therapy dose , route schedule Patients randomize receive : A : Lapatinib , 1250 mg/die , o B : Metformin , 1500 mg/die , os C : Lapatinib + Metformin , 1250 mg+1500 mg/die , os Patients receive study treatment disease progression document , extraordinary medical circumstance occur , intolerable toxicity occur , patient withdraws consent Statistical consideration Randomization stratify accord site metastasis : visceral versus non-visceral lesion . The primary objective study evaluate rate patient free disease progression 3 month randomization . The final analysis objective conduct total 168 patient enrol across three arm . This number patient needed test experiment-wise alpha = 0.05 power = 80 % show statistically significant increment 10 % rate patient without disease progression 3 month , assume rate 5 % treatment without lapatinib and/or metformin ( P0=5 % P1=15 % ) . After accrue total 23 evaluable patient arm , trial design proceed step 2 randomize additional patient arm two patient free disease progression 3 month . Otherwise , study arm less expected response discontinue . In second stage 33 additional patient enrol study arm reach total 56 total patient per arm . If less 6 patient per arm free disease progression increment correspond treatment consider significant . Procedures : The study consist screening period , treatment period follow survival Screening Phase Within 4 week prior randomization : A signed write , informed consent obtain prior study specific assessment initiate . The following perform prior randomization - Radiographic complete assessment disease status ( chest Xray ; liver ultrasound , bone scan CT MR target lesion involve site ) - Hematology biochemistry - Pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential - Cardiac assessment ECG , echocardiography multi-gated scintigraphic scan ( MUGA ) - Medical history , physical examination , vital sign , sign symptom breast cancer lesion , weight , height , ECOG performance status Treatment Phase : MONTHLY 3 month since randomization - Physical examination , include clinical disease assessment , ECOG performance status , vital sign - Hematology biochemistry - Safety evaluation ( i.e . routine collection adverse event ) - Patient 's compliance - Concomitant therapy EVERY 3 MONTHS first 3 month treatment disease progression document , intolerable toxicity occur , patient withdraws consent : - Physical examination , include clinical disease assessment , ECOG performance status , vital sign - Radiographic disease assessment ( use method screen ) - Hematology biochemistry - Safety evaluation ( i.e . routine collection adverse event ) - Concomitant therapy - Patient 's compliance EVERY 6 MONTHS disease progression document , intolerable toxicity occur , patient withdraws consent : - Complete radiographic assessment - Assessment LVEF use method screening Afterwards : EVERY 6 MONTHS disease progression trial discontinuation due intolerable toxicity reason . Patients may receive therapy follow study discontinuation . Patients continue follow survival minimum 3 year .</detailed_description>
