	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine signal pathway change gene expression melanocytes subject history non-melanoma skin cancer expose oral vitamin D. If vitamin D find inhibit signal pathway involve development melanoma BRAF , protein involve cell proliferation , oral vitamin D could explore chemoprevention melanoma skin cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Vitamin D important hormone multiple genetic effect different tissue type mediate signal vitamin D receptor . Recent study show vitamin D signal result decreased innate immunity increase adaptive immunity . Multiple epidemiologic study suggest vitamin D may play role decrease risk develop multiple type cancer , include skin cancer . In context relative success novel immune-related therapy include PD1 inhibitor , improve immuno-surveillance , ipilimumab , suppress T cell response , increase promise treatment strategy activate innate immunity . This lead u ask question whether vitamin D could increase immune surveillance melanoma via increased activity adaptive immune system . Prior study perform group others suggest vitamin D may play role decrease melanoma risk . An epidemiologic study Women 's Health Initiative show woman prior history NMSC receive calcium vitamin D supplementation low risk subsequently develop melanoma . At time , woman low serum vitamin D level high risk develop melanoma . Furthermore , recent clinical study show vitamin D supplementation increase serum vitamin D level ultimately result increase vitamin D receptor signal benign nevus . Taken together , finding lead u ask whether oral vitamin D supplementation could impact immune signal benign nevi potentially underpin theoretical chemo-preventive role vitamin D melanoma .</detailed_description>
