	<brief_summary>Muscle protein accumulate damage age lead loss muscle mass function old people . Exercise increase make new protein removal old protein , know effect change age type exercise . The investigator determine ability endurance , resistance , combination exercise training remove older-damaged protein make newer-functional muscle protein group young old people . The investigator particularly study protein involve energy production ( mitochondrial protein ) force production ( contractile protein ) . Hypothesis 1 : Older people great accumulation damage protein young people . Hypothesis 2 : Aerobic exercise decrease accumulation damage form contractile mitochondrial protein young old people . Hypothesis 3 : Resistance exercise decrease accumulation damage form contractile protein young old people .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Aerobic Resistance Training Accumulation Old , Modified Proteins Young Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The loss muscle mass function age lead high social economic cost . Lifestyle intervention help maintain muscle mass function beneficial improve health decrease cost associated loss independence elderly . Muscle protein accumulate damage aging , suggest lead loss function . The biological process remove damage protein synthesis new protein appear decrease age . Exercise know increase process remove old synthesis new muscle protein may effect lifestyle intervention improve muscle quality function . Additionally , specific type protein appear decay age include contractile mitochondrial protein . Different type exercise training increase make specific protein . The investigator examine ability aerobic resistance training increase quality mitochondrial contractile protein young old people .</detailed_description>
