	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) occur people exposure event cause extreme fear helplessness . The incidence war zone worldwide prevalence violence large city U.S. , increase likelihood people experience traumatize event lifetime . About 1 10 people survive event develop PTSD , people get good time . This suggest people may biological vulnerability make hard recover . One biological risk factor may relate stress hormone work people get sick . Another people react thing make afraid nervous , found PTSD patient higher normal fear reaction . The part brain react fearful stimulation link stress hormone ; purpose study examine system interact . The study suppress stress hormone ( cortisol ) production one group participant , another get placebo . When cortisol suppress , participant undergo startle study see fear response decrease . We expect people PTSD show normal fear response cortisol level reduce , similar people without PTSD . This research help discover new medicine people PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study provide innovative tool tease apart relationship amygdala-dependent neurophysiology HPA-axis sensitivity human clinical population . Our recent discovery cortisol suppression reduces fear response PTSD couple development new fear conditioning paradigm , provide unique opportunity interrogate amygdala-HPA interaction determine aspect neurobiological underpinnings PTSD-related pathology . AIM 1 : Does HPA suppression decrease fear-potentiated startle subject PTSD ? Evidence preliminary study suggest subject PTSD exaggerate expression fear response danger safety cue fear acquisition , cortisol suppression reduce pathological fear . - Aim 1a examine baseline fear-potentiated startle ( FPS ) response , well cognitive awareness PTSD patient traumatize Non-PTSD control fear condition experiment 10 hour dexamethasone administration double-blind , placebo control crossover design . - Aim 1b examine outcome measure PTSD patient control fear condition experiment 1 hour dexamethasone administration order control direct effect dexamethasone . HYPOTHESIS : We predict , base preliminary data , heighten physiological fear response PTSD patient relative control normalize cortisol suppression , cognitive awareness alter . These data provide new important tool understand role dynamic regulation HPA axis modulation human fear response . AIM 2 : Does HPA suppression enhance extinction fear-potentiated startle subject PTSD ? Evidence preliminary study suggest subject PTSD exaggerate fear response danger cue fear extinction , cortisol suppression facilitate extinction . - Aim 2a examine fear-potentiated startle ( FPS ) response PTSD patient traumatize Non-PTSD control fear extinction , fear acquire 10 hour dexamethasone administration double-blind , placebo control crossover design . - Aim 2b examine outcome measure PTSD patient control , fear acquire 1 hour dexamethasone administration order control direct effect dexamethasone . HYPOTHESIS : We predict , base preliminary data , heighten physiological fear response PTSD patient relative control extinction reduce thereby facilitate extinction cortisol suppression , cognitive awareness alter . These data extend understand HPA regulation extinction fear , well provide direct , testable new therapeutic approach enhance extinction ( exposure therapy ) clinical PTSD population .</detailed_description>
