	<brief_summary>This 2x2 factorial randomize control trial ( KPAF Trial ) , evaluate two different pharmacological approach improve long-term outcome catheter ablation atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . The study compose UNmasking Dormant Electrical Reconduction Adenosine TriPhosphate ( UNDER-ATP ) Trial Efficacy Antiarrhythmic Drugs Short-Term Use Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation ( EAST-AF ) Trial . Patients paroxysmal persistent AF randomize ATP guide ablation control group 1:1 ratio procedure ( UNDER-ATP Trial ) . Excluding severe procedural complication substantial bradycardia identify first ablation persistent AF , patient randomize 1:1 ratio antiarrhythmic-drug ( AAD ) control group procedure ( EAST-AF Trial ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common tachyarrhythmia cause disable symptom stroke . Although catheter ablation develop curative therapy AF , still associate considerably high rate AF recurrence , approximately 30-40 % patient paroxysmal AF 50-80 % among persistent AF . Because ectopic beat trigger AF originate myocardial sleeve pulmonary vein ( PVs ) , mainstay catheter ablation AF PV isolation . The major cause early late AF recurrence follow successful PV isolation consider electrical reconnection leave atrium ( LA ) PVs . Therefore , important establish permanent LA-PV disconnection , although high energy application associate increase risk procedural complication , include cardiac tamponade , PV stenosis/occlusion LA-esophageal fistula . Adenosine adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) report unmask dormant electrical conduction LA PVs successful PV isolation . Thus , adenosine ATP guide additional ablation disappearance dormant electrical conduction propose adjunctive approach establish permanent LA-PV disconnection thereby decrease AF recurrence post ablation . However , several small observational study show efficacy adenosine ATP guide ablation , approach recognize standard therapy . On hand , sizable portion AF recurrence early ablation consider due irritability LA ablation . Thus , short term use antiarrhythmic drug ( AADs ) ablation propose adjunctive approach prevent early AF recurrence , also improve long-term outcome promote reverse remodel LA maintenance sinus rhythm first 2-3 month period ablation . The 5A study , recently report single-center study , randomize 110 patient paroxysmal AF AAD control group . In AAD group , AAD use 6 week ablation . Although AAD significantly reduce early AF recurrence first 6 week , discontinuation drug result similar AF-free rate 6 month . Considering small number patient enrol 5A study , result conclusive , lack statistical power determine effect short-tem use AAD follow successful ablation AF long-term clinical outcome . Also , approach expect effective patient persistent AF rather 'self-terminating ' paroxysmal AF . In addition , 6 week may short promote reverse remodel LA . Accordingly , plan 2x2 factorial randomize control trial ( KPAF trial ) , evaluate efficacy ATP guide additional ablation 90 day use AADs post ablation . Approximately 2,000 patient paroxysmal persistent AF randomize ATP guide ablation control group 1:1 ratio procedure ( UNDER-ATP trial ) . Excluding severe procedural complication substantial bradycardia identify first ablation persistent AF , patient randomize 1:1 ratio AAD control group procedure ( EAST-AF trial ) . Approximately 5 % patient expect exclude EAST-AF trial ablation , patient exclude UNDER-ATP trial , whose data analyze intention-to-treat manner . The follow-up duration one year .</detailed_description>
