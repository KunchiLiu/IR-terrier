	<brief_summary>Prolonged wound drainage follow total joint replacement surgery show predictor postoperative infection . Several factor associate delay wound heal increase risk infection . Namely hypertension , obesity , diabetes , smoke autoimmune disease show detrimental effect wound heal . The purpose study verify finding determine additional pharmacological , surgical patient relate factor may result prolonged wound drainage , prolong hospital stay increase risk infection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Risk Factors Prolonged Wound Healing Following Primary Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study type : Prospective cohort study . Inclusion criterion : All patient receive primary total hip knee replacement surgery Hvidovre Hospital January 1st 2012 December 31st 2014 . Exclusion criterion : none Intervention : none New hypothesis test : 1 . Hypertension associate prolonged wound drainage increase risk infection 2 . Patients receive Statin treatment decrease postoperative wound drainage decrease risk infection . 3 . Patients receive Bisphosphonate treatment increase postoperative wound drainage increase risk infection . Measured patient relate risk variable : Age , sex , primary OA diagnosis , diabetes , smoking , BMI , alcohol consumption , autoimmune disease hypertension record upon admission patient hospital . Hypertension define patient diagnose HT previously surgery , receive medical treatment systolic / diastolic BP 140/90 mmHg upon admission . Patients normal BP upon admission receive treatment HT classify regulate HT . Patients elevate BP upon admission without previous HT diagnosis classify newly diagnose HT . `` Smoking '' de divide smoker , non-smokers former smoker . Further , average number cigarette pr day last month record current smoker . Measured pharmacological risk variable : Use statin , bisphosphonates , anticoagulant , NSAID 's corticosteroid time admission record . Measured surgical risk variable : Surgery time , pneumatic tourniquet time , peroperative blood loss , postoperative decrease hemoglobin level , surgical complication , antibiotic bleeding prophylaxis record surgeon upon completion surgery . Outcome measure : Wound-oozing time , length hospital stay , wound infection , surgical revision . Wound define actively drain gauze cover wound wet edge fluid note originate surgical site . The nursing staff record wound drainage hospital stay patient instruct self-assessment upon dismissal use patient-diary . Wound drainage record twice day : before- afternoon . All patient see outpatient clinic staple removal control self -assessment drainage-diary 3 week surgery . Time wound appear dry note . Presence absence clinical infection note accord ASEPSIS criterion . Statistical analysis : Multiple linear regression analysis perform model effect measure risk variable time dry wound , length hospital stay risk wound infection . Data collection : All data collection anonymous . Patient consent require since study involve evaluation exist data record individual subject identify either directly identifier link subject . The data collection report `` Datatilsynet '' .</detailed_description>
