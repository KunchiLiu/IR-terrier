	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second lead cause cancer death U.S. yet approximately half eligible adult up-to-date colon cancer screen rate screen lower among low income lack insurance . A physician 's recommendation screen consistently show one powerful predictor CRC screening . Relatively study CRC screen conduct primary care . Disparities CRC screen rate see low socioeconomic rural individual often lack resource access screen .

This study test combination patient physician reminder strategy design ensure patient educate CRC screen receives recommendation CRC screening physician . The main outcome colorectal cancer screen accept method . Rates screen compare across intervention group . We also determine much intervention cost per person screen . Patients due screen within practice ( base self-report ) ( never screen date screen ) randomize one four group receive office reminder system strategy increase intensity : 1 ) Usual care , 2 ) Physician chart reminder alone , 3 ) Physician chart reminder plus multifaceted mailed patient education , include postage pay fecal immunochemical test , reminder magnet , returnable CRC screen test preference sheet , 4 ) Physician chart reminder + multifaceted mailed patient education/FIT/magnet/preference sheet + telephone reminder encourage screen address barrier . Our central hypothesis provide office one CRC screen support system base Chronic Care Model significantly increase CRC screen rate comparison usual care , intervention cost-effective accepted practice .</detailed_description>
