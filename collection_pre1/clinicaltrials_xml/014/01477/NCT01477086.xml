	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia loss muscle mass function accompany age . The term sarcopenia come Greek `` sarx '' ( flesh ) `` penia '' ( loss ) . Sarcopenia topic great interest geriatrician , 2010 discuss possibility consider geriatric syndrome . Diagnostic criterion reduce muscle mass , reduce strength impaired physical performance . The presence muscle mass reduction set presarcopenia diagnosis , combine one two talk sarcopenia three define severe sarcopenia . The hypothesis study sarcopenia highly prevalent old people hip fracture . The increase inflammatory index old people , along bed rest , represent factor accelerate development sarcopenia . These factor together could base high percentage patient recover degree autonomy fracture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Pathophysiology Sarcopenia Elderly Patient With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence hip fracture Spain estimate 551 case per 100,000 population age 65 year , average cost treatment broken € 9,996.00 day hospitalization heart attack . In-hospital mortality 5.3 % . Data multicenter study 77 hospital Spanish territory 2003 coincide study conduct European country regard incidence , high percentage woman increase exponentially age . The fracture proximal femur ( hip ) substantial cause morbidity mortality elderly . Mortality one year hip fracture vary 12 37 % , incidence 11 % first month . 25 % elderly patient hip fracture require institutionalization , least temporarily , 40 % fully recover functional status fracture . Hip fracture major public health problem . It happen often elderly , average age patient admit 81.4 ± 8.1 year incidence increase significantly recent year . It cause high degree disability , mortality frequent large economic cost . 50 % patient independent hip fracture unable recover fully functionality , face often inability institutionalization . Only 30-35 % elderly hip fracture regain previous degree independence basic activity daily live , 20-25 % instrumental activity . The investigator hope find high prevalence sarcopenia patient admit hip fracture , patient severe sarcopenia low functional level admission discharge phenomenon recover . The investigator hope find relationship elevated inflammatory index severity sarcopenia . The investigator hope presence sarcopenia , severity , correlate positively occurrence complication hospitalization .</detailed_description>
