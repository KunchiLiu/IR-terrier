	<detailed_description>Hypercapnia use conjunction hyperpnoea provide rapid return responsiveness inhale anesthesia . The benefit accelerate patient recovery operating room may extend post anesthesia care unit patient alert easy care arrive unit . Respiratory pattern gas level - include CO2 , O2 , anesthetic vapor - measure order well understand patient 's respiratory status recovery . In Feb 2009 finish first study ( IRB 26111 ) submit publication . The journal reviewer identify serious limitation : could report whether treated patient recover anesthesia faster treatment ( inspired CO2 ) cause breath vigorously treatment cause anesthetic vapor clear rapidly brain . Our new application use essentially study protocol former study add chest band measure patient 's rate breathing expire gas monitoring measure rate vapor remove .</detailed_description>
