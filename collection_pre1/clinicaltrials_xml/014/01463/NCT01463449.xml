	<detailed_description>It recognize low grade inflammation key player development atherosclerosis insulin resistance ( Haslam , James 2005 ) . Circulating level inflammatory marker high sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) interleukin ( IL ) -6 find increased subject cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) type 2-diabetes ( Dandona , Aljada &amp; Bandyopadhyay 2004 ) . We others show obesity , particular abdominal obesity , associate persistent increase level inflammatory marker ( Bruun et al . 2007 , Christiansen et al . 2010a ) . Thus low grade inflammation may represent `` common soil '' pathogenesis atherosclerosis insulin resistance represent link metabolic disturbance obesity . Besides function storage organ , adipose tissue ( AT ) exert complex role organism . In obesity adipose tissue infiltrate increase amount macrophage , particular macrophage express release wide range hormone cytokine , collectively call adipokines , biological function show include involvement glucose metabolism , lipid metabolism , adipocyte differentiation , immunity , vasculature neuron development eat behavior ( Trayhurn , Wood 2004 ) . Among adipokines express AT pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα , IL-6 , pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-8 , MCP-1 , MIP1α , thrombotic factor plasminogen inhibitor 1 ( PAI-1 ) , AT specific protein adiponectin leptin . Hypertrophied adipocytes , see obese subject associate insulin resistance show display distinct gene expression inflammatory marker compare small human adipocytes show adipocyte size important determinant adipokine secretion . Moreover positive association grade obesity expression pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα , IL-6 , IL-8 , find whereas inverse association adiponectin obesity report ( Kern et al . 2003 , Bruun et al . 2003 ) .In accordance observation , find AT expression MCP-1 up-regulated obese subject ( Christiansen , Richelsen &amp; Bruun 2005 ) whereas AT expression adiponectin obese subject ( mean BMI 40 kg/m2 ) find down-regulated 50 % compare lean subject ( mean BMI 22 kg/m2 ) ( Christiansen et al . 2010b ) . Thus , adipose tissue inflammation result dysfunction adipose tissue may important factor relate obesity insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , diabetes , cardiovascular disease . CD163 : CD-163 membrane bound receptor primary express monocyte macrophage . CD163 originally describe hemoglobin scavenger receptor since involve remove hemoglobin release rupture red blood cell ( Moestrup , Moller 2004 ) . A soluble variant CD-163 ( s-CD-163 ) present plasma elevate pathological condition activate monocyte-macrophage system . Recently s-CD-163 associate various inflammatory condition ( Moestrup , Moller 2004 ) , recently rather strong predictor development type 2 diabetes large Danish cohort ( Moller et al . 2011 ) . Thus , s-CD-163 may marker related inflammation well metabolic condition maybe link low grade inflammation metabolic abnormality , furthermore , may marker obese state complication . Only subset overweight obese individual develop insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes related disease ( Stefan et al . 2008 , Bluher 2010 ) . These `` healthy '' obese subject characterize less adipose tissue inflammation less insulin resistance compare unhealthy obese individual . Consequently would great importance develop marker predictor could discriminate `` healthy '' unhealthy obese subject order make good selection invasive treatment e.g . surgery , pharmacotherapy etc . Research Plan : 1 . Is CD163 pathophysiologically involve adipose tissue inflammation obesity ? Adipose tissue ( AT ) take various region lean obese subject - either subcutaneous fat biopsy ( lean subject ) , surgery ( obese subject - BMI &gt; 30 ) , bariatric surgery ( gastric bypass ) obese subject ( BMI &gt; 40 ) - subcutaneous visceral AT investigate parallel obese individual . In adipose tissue amount macrophage determine biochemical ( e.g . CD68 ) microscopically method ( immunohistochemistry ) . Moreover , gene expression ( PCR ) protein ( Western blot ) CD163 detect AT related expression protein number proinflammatory adipokines . 2 . Is s-CD163 marker adipose tissue inflammation metabolic disturbance ? Blood sample individual project 1 also obtain s-CD163 measure ( house sandwich ELISA kit ( Moller , Hald &amp; Moestrup 2002 ) ) . These value relate amount macrophage AT expression CD136 AT . Moreover , insulin sensitivity determine HOMA model perform , s-CD163 related HOMA score . 3 . Is s-CD163 affected weight loss , dietary change ( e.g . effect fructose ( proinflammatory ) effect resveratrol ( antiinflammatory ) ? 1 . Weight loss induce bariatric surgery ( bypass ) obese subject ( BMI &gt; 40 ) . S-CD163 change insulin sensitivity ( HOMA ) inflammatory marker ( e.g . hsCRP , IL-6 , TNF , MCP-1 , adiponectin etc . ) measure 6 12 month surgery . From power calculation plan include 45 obese subject study - half type 2 diabetes . 2 . We perform dietary investigation fructose ( soft drink take 6 month 50 overweight obese subject ) induces ectopic fat accumulation liver determine MR-spectroscopy insulin resistance , dietary intervention resveratrol reduce liver fat antiinflammatory effect . In frozen plasma sample study s-CD163 measure order get insight dietary effect fructose resveratrol related marker .</detailed_description>
