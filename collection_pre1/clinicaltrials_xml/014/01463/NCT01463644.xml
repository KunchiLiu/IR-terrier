	<brief_summary>Some patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) large number specific white blood cell call eosinophil airway . These cell also responsible cause episode worsen respiratory symptom ( exacerbation ) often cause irreversible damage airway . This subset COPD patient often require oral steroid bring number eosinophil airway . Steroids harmful effect several body system like bone , blood pressure , blood glucose control cause recurrent infection . Mepolizumab drug specifically target eosinophil reduce number airway . This drug show effective decreasing exacerbation rate time exacerbation asthma patient eosinophils airway . Targeting eosinophils COPD patient show reduce severe exacerbation . Hence likely COPD patient eosinophils airways benefit similarly reduce rate time exacerbation . Study Hypothesis : Does mepolizumab decrease sputum eosinophil patient fix airflow obstruction ( COPD ) eosinophilic bronchitis ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mepolizumab Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases ( COPD ) With Eosinophilic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care patient moderate severe COPD combination inhale corticosteroid , long-acting beta agonist long-acting muscarinic agonist ( 3-5 ) . This treatment recommendation consider heterogeneity bronchitis patient COPD . A third patient COPD without asthma may eosinophilic bronchitis likely respond inhale corticosteroid prednisone . Approximately 1 5 exacerbation also likely associate eosinophilic exacerbation ( 6 ) . This unlikely control prevented current recommendation examine bronchitis time exacerbation . None major clinical trial evaluate treatment form basis current guideline examine bronchitis time exacerbation . Quantitative cell count sputum provide reliable method ass bronchitis . Sputum safely induce hypertonic saline even patient moderate severe COPD . Similarly asthma ( 7 ) , presence eosinophil sputum predictor short-term response force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) quality life inhale ( 8 ) oral corticosteroid ( 9 ) . A single study demonstrate normalize eosinophil sputum patient COPD reduces severe exacerbation hospitalization approximately 60 % ( 10 ) . The relative risk reduction study great demonstrate study conduct far COPD . Long-term study conduct . Our recent experience mepolizumab demonstrate specifically target eosinophil patient severe asthma prednisone-sparing effect ( 11 ) decrease exacerbation ( 11,12 ) . In study also improve lung function include patient associated COPD . This surprising give persistent airway eosinophilia contribute airway remodel ( 13 ) . Indeed , improvement FEV1 associate decrease sputum hyaluron ( 14 ) six month treatment period . Changes lung function symptom consistently observe previous mepolizumab trial ( 12,15 ) . This clearly related precise patient phenotyped term sputum eosinophilia . In study recruit patient persistent sputum eosinophilia , decrease exacerbation associate improvement FEV1 ( 16 ) . It thus likely specific treatment anti-IL5 direct eosinophil would superior current standard treatment decrease exacerbation patient COPD continue eosinophils airway whose airway disease eosinophil-driven component evidence persistent airway eosinophilia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society follow : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease preventable treatable disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence Sputum eosinophils &gt; 3 % randomization least one occasion past 2 year . If historic data available , documented improvement FEV1 least 12 % course prednisone past 2 year use surrogate presence airway eosinophilia FEV1/Vital Capacity ( VC ) &lt; 70 % FEV1 &lt; 60 % predict normal value calculate use NHANES III reference equation Screening Visit At least one major exacerbation require prednisone precede 12 month . If patient currently well control optimize sputum cell count ( eosinophils &lt; 2 % ) , document history exacerbation eosinophilia uncontrolled . A signed date write informed consent prior study participation . Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoking great 10 packyears [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ] . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Screening Visit Male female adult . A female eligible enter participate study either Nonchild bear potential child bear age negative pregnancy test screening , agree acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly Current asthma ( 12 % reversibility bronchodilator ) Sputum eosinophils &lt; 3 % fluticasone ( equivalent ) 250Âµg bid . Inability use salmeterol tiotropium Significant comorbidity prevents participate study Known bronchiectasis immune deficiency disorder would predispose patient recurrent infection .
