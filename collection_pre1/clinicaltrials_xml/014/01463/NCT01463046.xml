	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Finding Proof-of-concept Study Panobinostat With Standard Dose Cytarabine Daunorubicin Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , incidence acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) approximately 3.5 case per 100,000 person per year . Approximately 13,000 people diagnose AML 2009 9,000 die disease , make AML 6th lead cause cancer death . Over past three decade , AML survival improve young patient 5-year survival rate great 60 % adult age 45 year likely owe improvement induction consolidation chemotherapy , allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) supportive care . Post-remission therapy high-dose cytarabine-based regimen cytarabine anthracycline base induction improve disease free overall survival expense increase treatment related mortality limit use many old patient significant comorbidities . Although allogeneic HSCT remain standard care patient poor risk AML relapse disease , advanced age , comorbidities donor availability preclude option large number patient make improvement tolerability efficacy induction therapy important goal . Over half newly diagnose AML patient 65 year age third age 75 year . Unlike young patient , prognosis elderly patient AML still dismal five-year survival rate less 10 % patient age 65 year . For last thirty year , induction therapy standard dose cytarabine anthracycline remain standard care elderly patient AML . In elderly , complete response rate induction chemotherapy low young patient 40 60 % median survival approach 12 month . New strategy use novel agent increase sensitivity malignant myeloid precursor standard induction chemotherapy may improve complete response relapse rate without increase treatment related mortality . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) The myelodysplastic syndrome neoplasms hematopoietic progenitor cell characterize ineffective hematopoiesis increase risk transformation AML . Clinically , patient develop symptom relate cytopenia , typically progressive anemia without thrombocytopenia neutropenia unrelated define reversible cause nutritional deficiency . Histologically , MDS suggest presence dysplasia &gt; 10 % cell one myeloid lineage bone marrow evaluation . Characteristic cytogenetic abnormality also aid make diagnosis MDS . The incidence MDS U.S. estimate 3.4 case per 100,000 people per year incidence increase 10 fold people age 70 . Risk factor development MDS include advanced age , male sex , prior exposure DNA-damaging chemotherapy radiation therapy , typically treatment malignancy . As group , patient advance MDS MDS progress AML treatment resistant disease low response rate short duration response induction therapy . The International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) primary MDS assign four MDS risk category ( Low , INT-1 , INT-2 , High ) base bone marrow myeloblast percentage , specific cytogenetic abnormality , number cytopenias estimate survival risk transformation AML . Low INT-1 risk MDS patient median survival 5.7 3.3 year , respectively , absence therapy . Advanced MDS patient IPSS risk group INT-2 High fare much less well median survival 1.1 0.4 year , respectively . INT-2 High-risk MDS also associate high risk transformation AML . In addition , hematopoietic precursor patient advance MDS frequently express multi-drug resistance ( MDR1 ) gene product P-glycoprotein , possibly explain low response rate short duration response group conventional induction therapy . A Phase III trial P-glycoprotein inhibitor valspodar combination mitoxantrone , etoposide cytarabine relapse refractory AML high-risk MDS fail show improved outcomes P-glycoprotein inhibition . As , novel therapeutic strategy overcome intrinsic resistance chemotherapy see advanced MDS need improve induction chemotherapy primary therapy bridge allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant . Given relatively long survival low rate progression AML see patient IPSS Low INT-1 risk disease , allogeneic transplant typically reserve fail conservative management erythropoiesis stimulate agent , G-CSF , hypomethylating agent azacitidine decitabine , lenalidomide , immune suppression therapy . For patient 60 year age younger advance MDS ( INT-2 , High ) , allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant appropriate therapy prolongs life expectancy . Due advance age significant co-morbidities , allogeneic hematopoietic transplant appropriate treatment modality large number patient advance MDS . In addition , stem cell donor available patient . For patient advanced MDS , hypomethylating agent enrollment clinical trial appropriate treatment option give poor outcome patient population . A phase III open-label , randomize trial azacitidine versus conventional care regimen advance MDS show superior overall survival patient treat azacitidine ( 24.5 versus 15.0 month , HR 0.58 ; 95 % CI 0.43-0.77 ) . Although decitabine activity MDS , show prolong survival advance MDS date . In phase III study compare decitabine supportive care , decitabine show superior response rate delay time development AML . Anthracyclines AML therapy Anthracycline chemotherapy agent ( daunorubicin , idarubicin , mitoxantrone ) highly active AML essential part initial induction therapy fit intensive chemotherapy . The optimal dose anthracycline maximize response survival preserve safety still determine . For daunorubicin , Phase III randomize study young patient age 17 60 year AML demonstrate standard dose cytarabine 100 mg/m2 daily 7 day combination daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 daily 3 day superior daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily 3 day improve complete remission rate ( 70.6 % vs. 57.3 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) median overall survival ( 23.7 vs. 15.7 month , p=0.003 ) . Toxicity significantly different two group . A similar Phase III study AML patient 60 year age old compare daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 90 mg/m2 3 day combination cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily 7 day . Although complete remission rate high patient receive 90 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose ( 64 % vs 54 % , p=0.002 ) , difference see survival . Notably , patient age 60-65 year receive high daunorubicin dose superior complete remission rate , event-free survival overall survival . To date , head-to-head comparison daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 versus 90 mg/m2 publish . Histone deacetylases inhibitor AML MDS HDAC inhibitor show activity Phase I monotherapy trial AML advance MDS . A Phase I trial panobinostat monotherapy primarily AML yield transient hematologic response reduction peripheral blood blast count 8 11 patient consistent documented vitro activity drug . Major toxicity include nausea , diarrhea , hypokalemia , anorexia , thrombocytopenia reversible QTcF prolongation . Similar response rare complete response also see HDAC inhibitor romidepsin MGCD0103 AML MDS . Synergy HDAC inhibitor anthracyclines As monotherapy , HDAC inhibitor unlikely impact treatment AML advance MDS although strong biologic rationale use agent combination therapy . By inhibit deacetylation histone , HDAC inhibitor generate open chromatin structure susceptible DNA damaging effect anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent , instance administer 48 hour HDAC inhibitor . In vitro , HDAC inhibitor potentiate cytotoxic effect anthracyclines leukemia cell line . Panobinostat , specifically , act synergistically anthracycline doxorubicin induce DNA damage , increase histone acetylation activate program cell death AML cell line primary AML cell . The administration anthracycline daunorubicin panobinostat predict synergistic vivo may improve complete response relapse rate AML . Proper sequence HDAC inhibitor anthracyclines likely important success combination . Pretreatment HDAC inhibitor prior anthracycline exposure may provide synergistic effect well increase nuclear DNA exposure anthracycline . In cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cell , treatment HDAC inhibitor vorinostat lead chromatin decondensation maximal 48 hour HDAC inhibitor treatment . In system , co-administration vorinostat epirubicin lead increase apoptosis whereas 48 hour pre-incubation vorinostat lead synergistic increase apoptosis associate increased nuclear accumulation epirubicin increase DNA damage . In AML , maximal epigenetic effect appear occur 48 hour HDAC inhibitor exposure well . Anticancer activity DAC inhibitor Alterations chromosome structure play critical role control gene transcription . These epigenetic alteration include modification histone others protein acetylation and/or phosphorylation . Normally , modification balance finely highly reversible normal tissue , may imbalanced heritable tumor cell . DAC inhibitor increase histone acetylation , thereby modulate expression subset gene coordinate fashion . Several tumor suppressor gene associate malignant phenotype repress epigenetic mechanism sporadic cancer . Thus therapy DAC inhibitor may alter tumor phenotype inhibit growth tumor . Multiple hallmark cancer regulate acetylation/deacetylation : - DAC inhibition target histone nonhistone protein . Targeting acetylation status nonhistone , tumor-associated protein mediate proliferation may underlie antitumor mechanism DAC inhibitor . - Nonhistone protein regulate acetylation include α-tubulin , p53 , HIF-1α , HSP90 . These protein substrate DACs . - The ability single agent target multiple molecular feature tumor cell may result good efficacy range different tumor type . - HSP90 involve protein stability degradation ; inhibition HSP90 affect protein turnover diseases multiple myeloma B-cell malignancy . - Acetylated HIF-1α degrade longer act tumor growth factor . Class II DAC inhibitor target histone deacetylase ( HDAC DAC ) 6 , result increased acetylation HIF-1α decrease vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , thereby inhibit angiogenesis . - Both acetylation ubiquitylation often occur lysine residue , process occur simultaneously . Acetylation allow increase stability , ubiquitylation lead protein degradation . Therefore , DACs decrease half-life protein expose lysine residue ubiquitylation . Panobinostat ( LBH589 ) Panobinostat ( LBH589 ) deacetylase inhibitor ( DACi ) belong structurally novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid class compound . It potent class I/II pan-DAC inhibitor ( pan-DACi ) show anti-tumor activity pre-clinical model cancer patient . Deacetylases ( DAC ) target lysine group chromatin transcription factor various non-histone protein p53 , tubulin , HSP90 Rb . Panobinostat formulate oral capsule solution intravenous ( i.v . ) injection . Both oral i.v . formulation currently investigate ongoing Phase I Phase II study advance solid tumor hematological malignancy . Inhibition DAC provide novel approach cancer treatment . Histones part core proteins nucleosomes , acetylation deacetylation protein play role regulation gene expression . Highly charge deacetylated histone bind tightly phosphate backbone DNA , inhibit transcription , presumably , limit access transcription factor RNA polymerases DNA . Acetylation neutralize charge histone generate open DNA conformation . This conformation allow transcription factor associate transcription apparatus access DNA , promote expression correspond gene . The oppose activity two group enzymes , histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) DAC control amount acetylation . In normal cell balance exist HAT DAC activity lead cell specific pattern gene expression . Perturbation balance produce change gene expression . Several line evidence suggest aberrant recruitment DAC result modification chromatin structure may play role change gene expression see transformed cell . For example , silence tumor suppressor gene level chromatin common human tumor DAC complex show crucial activity AML-specific fusion proteins PLZF-RAR-α , PML-RAR-α , AML1/ETO . DAC inhibitor ( DACi ) show induce differentiation , cell cycle arrest apoptosis culture tumor cell , inhibit growth tumor animal model . In addition , DACi show induce expression p21 , key mediator cell cycle arrest G1 phase cellular differentiation . Tumor growth inhibition apoptosis response DACi treatment may also mediate change acetylation non-histone protein ( e.g. , HSP90 , p53 , HIF-1α , α-tubulin ) . For example , chaperone protein HSP90 show acetylated cell treat DACi . Acetylation HSP90 inhibit ability bind newly synthesize client protein , thus prevent proper client protein fold function . In absence HSP90 function , misfolded protein target degradation proteasome . Many protein require HSP90 association critical cancer cell growth , include ErbB1 , ErbB2 , AKT , Raf , KDR , BCR-ABL . Acetylation HSP90 cell treat DACi inhibits chaperone function HSP90 , lead degradation client proteins eventual cell death . The potential clinical utility use DACi cancer therapy first suggest activity DACi , sodium phenylbutyrate , acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . An adolescent female patient relapse APL , longer respond trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) alone , achieve complete clinical remission treatment combination ATRA DACi sodium phenylbutyrate .</detailed_description>
