	<brief_summary>Chronic HCV infection one common cause chronic liver disease . Approximately 6-10 % general public expect suffer infection . In case patient treat appropriate time , patient develop sequelae chronic liver disease e.g . cirrhosis liver , Ascites , Hepatocellular carinoma . Interferon alpha 2 alpha 2b injection Ribavirin combination treatment choice people suffer Chronic HCV infection combination need administer 6-12 month . Interferons biological agent administer parenterally . Interferons expensive associate number minor major adverse effect . Ribavirin also associate significant adverse effect . These compound consider one ideal form treatment . In past , quite natural product test assess hepatoprotective activity possibly anti viral activity well . These include Vitamin C ( Ascorbic acid ) , Vitamin E , Zinc , Silymarin , Red beet root , crush licorice etc . etc . Rationale Iodine , Potassium iodide Ascorbic acid natural product use management Thyroiditis chronic cutaneous fungal infection . This combination iodine compound along ascorbic acid use management chronic hepatitis B &amp; C central Asian state e.g . Kazakhstan etc . The investigator conduct feasibility study oral Iodine Compound { RENESSANS } give patient suffer HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis anti-viral activity safety analyze . In study , RENESSANS contain regimen well tolerate patient show antiviral activity . In study investigator assess whether administration RENESSANS { oral } improve antiviral activity patient receive standard interferon therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Primary The primary objective study assess efficacy combination therapy comprise RENESSANS , INTERFERONS RIBAVIRIN management treatment na√Øve HCV relate Chronic Active Hepatitis patient . 2 . Secondary The secondary objective study : 1 . Determine biochemical virological improvement patient suffer HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis . 2 . Determine safety tolerability Renessans { oral } administer part antiviral activity outline protocol . 3 . ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint number subject achieve 1 . Virological response evident Rapid Viral Response ( RVR ) , Early Viral Response ( EVR ) Sustained Viral Response ( SVR ) . 2 . Biochemical response evident normalization ALT . The secondary endpoint . Assessment safety tolerability RENESSANS : routine physical examination , routine clinical laboratory test , clinical monitoring adverse event report . 4 . INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study Design . This open label , active control , three arm , parallel-group study safety efficacy oral formulation natural iodine compound ( Renessans ) administer alone combination standard interferon therapy patient suffer chronic HCV hepatitis . The enrolled patient test follow base line laboratory test VISIT 1 : CBC include platelet count ESR Liver function test include albumin total protein . Creatinine Serum electrolytes Thyroid Function test HBsAg , HIV antibody Urinalysis ANA , RA factor serum ferritin level USG abdomen HCV RNA ( PCR amplicor , roche ) qualitative analysis , positive quantitative analysis ( Real time ) genotype well . Pregnancy test case female Informed consent shall obtain individual patient 's treatment risk shall cover certified health insurance plan . Renessans administer eligible patient follow : Study Arm Dosing Schema Group I ORAL RENESSANS 5gm . Thrice Daily { active iodine 300mg } 6months Group II ORAL RENESSANS 5gm . Twice Daily +INTERFERON ALPHA 2b 3 Million Units s/c +RIBAVIRIN 15mg/kg Group II b INTERFERON ALPHA 2b 3 Million Units s/c +RIBAVIRIN 15mg/kg Blood sample shall collect store post - hoc analysis HCV RNA day 1 , 7 15 ( visit 2,3 &amp; 4 ) .
