	<brief_summary>Sports train aim enhance athlete 's performance ( overcompensation ) . To , athlete must go period fatigue low performance ( overreach ) . When training plan balance , fatigue short reversible.If train load heavy recuperation period short , lead persistence fatigue may reversible long term . This state fatigue part broader clinical picture overtraining , include stark change performance well mood sleep disorder . Many prediction characterization method base biological marker evaluate , put practice sport train due obstacle reliability , interindividual variability high cost . This study aim evaluate new approach base variability individual 's heart rate ( RR variability ) , way measure autonomic nervous system ( ASN ) activity . It non-invasive , low-cost , already proven useful athlete health monitoring .</brief_summary>
