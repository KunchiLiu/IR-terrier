	<brief_summary>Exercise intolerance major burden patient complex congenital heart disease ( CHD ) , significantly affect quality life . Cardiopulmonary exercise test provide reliable tool assess exercise capacity CHD patient risk stratification become part routine clinical assessment patient . Exercise effect muscular , metabolic circulatory system . While exercise training widely study chronic heart failure , efficacy adult CHD remain unknown . The investigator hypothesize structured exercise training improve exercise intolerance , particular peak VO2 . The aim multicenter , randomize study evaluate impact structure exercise training exercise intolerance patient complex CHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective , multicenter , interventional study . After study patient give write consent randomize either interventional group rehabilitation program control group without rehabilitation program . Patients randomize control group allow perform rehabilitation program 12 month randomisation . Patients interventional group perform structure exercise training 3 weekdays 12-weeks period . Training perform ergometer low-impact gymnastic relaxation training . All study participant follow investigation begin study 12 week : - Cardiopulmonary exercise test spirometry - 6-minute walk test - Blood work : BNP , Creatinine , Sodium , Potassium , Urat , Cholesterol ( HDL-L LDL-L ) - Validated Heart failure questionnaire ( SF-36 Minnesota Living heart failure questionnaire , German version Basel , Zürich Bern ) All test repeat clinically indicate follow-up visit 12 month baseline Primary outcome : Comparison peak VO2 end rehabilitation group . Secondary outcome : - Comparison 6-min walk test , VE/VCO2 slope , anaerobic threshold heart rate blood pressure response rehabilitation group - Changes 6-min walk test , peak VO2 , VE/VCO2 slope , anaerobic threshold heart rate blood pressure response end 12 month rehabilitation . - Changes quality-of-life assess validated heart failure questionnaire end 12 month rehabilitation comparison group . - Changes level brain-natriuretic peptide end 12 month rehabilitation . - Adverse event rehabilitation include new onset arrhythmia , admission due worsen heart failure death . The calculated sample size reach power 0.80 83 patient arm . Patients complex CHD exercise intolerance increase risk premature death severe cardiac complication include arrhythmia needing treatment , heart failure circulatory failure , pulmonary hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism endocarditis . Hence , likelihood major adverse cardiac event study phase considerably high . However , evidence functional worsen low-level exercise . Smaller study patient congenital heart disease and/or pulmonary hypertension report safety issue . Although sudden cardiac death one lead mode death population , extremely rare sudden death occurs exercise . Cardiac patient specific risk exercise-induced arrhythmia include study ( i.e . patient hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ) .</detailed_description>
