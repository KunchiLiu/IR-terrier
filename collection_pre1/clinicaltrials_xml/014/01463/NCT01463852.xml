	<brief_summary>In proof-of-principle study , patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , schedule initiate treatment per recommendation primary oncologist , receive single dose vincristine 2 milligram ( mg ) . The objective determine single dose induce rapid cell death isolate CLL cell . Vincristine 2 mg administer participant intravenously 5 minute . Blood sample collect intravenous line insert contralateral limb vincristine give , time zero ( pre-vincristine treatment ) , immediately vincristine administration ( within 2-10 minute upon completion administration ) 1 , 2 , 4 6 hour post-vincristine treatment . Patients later date receive chemotherapy treatment prescribe primary oncologist . Within 7 day vincristine administration , participant receive phone call research nurse discuss potential toxicity . At time initiation standard chemotherapy treatment , Principal Investigator also meet participant collect information regard adverse event .</brief_summary>
