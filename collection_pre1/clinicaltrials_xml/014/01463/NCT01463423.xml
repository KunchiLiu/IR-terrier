	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Individualized Lung Tumor Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( iSABR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy emerge important effective new treatment modality lung tumor , optimal dose regimen fully establish . Significant toxicity observe commonly use dose regimen , imply develop treatment regimen optimize treatment base tumor-specific factor could clinical benefit . This study test risk-adapted approach SABR delivery aim maximize tumor control minimize toxicity .</detailed_description>
