	<brief_summary>Head injury cause approximately 5 % epilepsy US . Past attempt prevent epilepsy treatment old antiepileptic drug unsuccessful . Levetiracetam novel AED potent antiepileptogenic property animal model epilepsy . It favorable side effect pharmacokinetic profile . It therefore strong candidate clinical trial epilepsy prevention follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . However , experience administer levetiracetam rapidly individual acute TBI . The investigator propose initiate evaluation levetiracetam prevention post-traumatic epilepsy determine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics feasibility acute chronic administration levetiracetam individual head injury high risk develop post-traumatic epilepsy . Further , investigator follow subject 2 year injury order obtain pilot data effect levetiracetam PTE . This pilot study first step evaluation levetiracetam prevention post-traumatic epilepsy .</brief_summary>
