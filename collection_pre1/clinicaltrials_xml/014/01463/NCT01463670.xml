	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether disease get well treat high dos Lenalidomide even disease return take low dos Lenalidomide . In patient multiple myeloma treat Lenalidomide maintenance , disease return . However , physician currently know disease would respond treatment high dos Lenalidomide . This important patient multiple myeloma number drug available treat disease limit . It important know Lenalidomide remain still effective still use situation . This study try find effect , good and/or bad high dos Lenalidomide patient disease return .</brief_summary>

Patients HDM/ASCT part initial line therapy continuous/maintenance lenalidomide initial therapy permit study . Patient must myeloma measurable either serum urine evaluation monoclonal component assay serum free light chain . Measurable disease define one following : serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dl , urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 h , and/or serum FLC assay : involve FLC level &gt; 10 mg/dL abnormal serum FLC ratio . Patients must adequate organ function include : Hepatic function Bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal ALT AST &lt; 3 x upper limit normal ; renal function creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min use CockcroftGault formula ; hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000 neutrophil per microliter , platelet &gt; 50,000 platelet per microliter hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL without transfusion support All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® program .

Patients uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection ( currently take medication progression clinical symptom ) . Patients prior malignancy except resect basal cell carcinoma treat cervical carcinoma situ cancer treat curative intent &gt; 5 year previously . Cancer treat curative intent &lt; 5 year previously allow unless approve Protocol Chairs . Female patient pregnant ( positive HCG ) breastfeeding . ( Lactating female must agree breast feed take lenalidomide ) Patients seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Prior organ transplant require immunosuppressive therapy . Patients previously expose high dos lenalidomide develop severe adverse event higher dos preclude incremental dosing .</criteria>
