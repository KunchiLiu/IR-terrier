	<brief_title>High Intensity Strength Training &amp; Bone Mineral Density Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osteoporosis progressive , systemic skeletal disorder characterize low bone mineral density ( BMD ) , deterioration microarchitecture bone tissue , consequent increase bone fragility susceptibility fracture . Typically disease show symptom fracture occur , hence refer `` silent epidemic '' . In Norway one two woman one four men experience fragility fracture age 50 . The loss bone strength age likely reflect skeletal response hormonal change mechanical environment decrease physical activity . Osteoporotic fracture often happen consequence minimal injury , especially hip , spine wrist . Hip fracture associate excess mortality first year fracture range 8.4 % 36 % . The increased mortality risk may persist several year thereafter , highlight need intervention reduce risk . Osteoporosis common disease recognize global problem WHO . The American College Sport Medicine suggest exercise countermeasure bone loss postmenopausal woman elderly subject . Peak bone mass think attained end third decade , hence early adult year might final opportunity augmentation . It indicate optimize peak bone mass may long-term effect bone health . Intervention study young woman show high impact exercise may improve BMD young adult . High intensity strength training also seem effectively improve BMD ratio bone turnover marker . Furthermore , explosive execution movement may important obtain BMD improvement resistance training . Maximal strength training ( MST ) characterize high mobilization force , high load , repetition ( 3-5 reps. ) per set emphasis maximal force mobilization concentric part movement . Recent study show MST highly efficient improve maximal strength ( 1RM ) rate force development ( RFD ) . Parameters 1RM RFD closely related BMD . In addition , recent study group show 12 week MST training ( three time week ) improve bone mass hip spine postmenopausal woman , diagnose osteoporosis ( article preparation ) . In present study want investigate impact heavy , explosive strength train bone mass bone metabolism young healthy woman yet reach peak bone mass . Physical activity BMD : One main factor responsible high incidence osteoporosis physical inactivity . Several study show physical activity lead increase BMD . Resistance- impact exercise show effective . A number study perform sedentary young woman perform high impact train show significant improvement BMD femoral neck lumbar spine . A study postmenopausal woman show power training effective maintaining BMD lumbar spine total hip conventional strength training . The effect training cellular tissue level divide 3 main factor : - Increased osteoblast activity bone formation - Reduced osteoclast activity bone resorption - Increased stability bone 's architectural structure In term prevention osteoporosis current exercise guideline , accord WHO , encouragement physically active lifestyle . Weight bearing activity , preferably resistance training recommend patient osteoporosis . Peak bone mass important factor determine long-term fracture risk . Therefore , effective strategy maximize peak bone mass young adult essential . Evidence indicate resistance high-impact exercise beneficial maintain optimize peak bone mass young adult . However , study investigate exercise altogether conclusive , mode exercise , regard type exercise , intensity execution , still remain unclear . Since MST exercise may increase bone mass osteoporotic woman , improve 1RM RFD ( closely relate skeletal health ) wish investigate potential MST training increase bone mass improve bone metabolism young female adult , yet reach peak bone mass . Goals study : 1 . Investigate effect heavy , explosive strength train bone mineral density compare control group young , healthy woman period 3 month . 2 . Study effect train intervention bone formation resorption marker 3 . Study effect physical capacity measurement .</detailed_description>
