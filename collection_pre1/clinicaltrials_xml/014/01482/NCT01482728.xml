	<brief_summary>The purpose study see investigator measure inhibition protein , Src ( name Sarcoma ) , tissue blood patient diagnosis endometrial cancer . Dasatinib drug block activity important protein cancer cell call Src . The investigator measure block Src bloodstream . However , investigator know measure bloodstream reflect blockage Src cancer tissue . The investigator study try see investigator match investigator see cancer tissue investigator see bloodstream . investigator hope future , investigator use blood measure protein inhibition dasatinib instead ask patient undergo repeat biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer common gynecologic malignancy ; affect 42,160 woman US 2009.1 In addition often hormonally driven tumor , express many case estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) . While endometrial cancer treat successfully surgery , still need new agent treatment advance recurrent disease . One potential agent dasatinib , since target , Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) , implicate genesis disease . Although extensive , increase evidence indicate link SFKs endometrial cancer . In addition one study breast cancer present American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) 2009 demonstrate patient ER positive breast tumor higher response rate dasatinib , suggest perhaps synergy hormonal therapy dasatinib . Because high efficacy inhibit SFKs growth tumor vasculature , well possible effect ER , dasatinib excite new possibility treatment endometrial cancer . Questions regard ability dasatinib inhibit primary target tumor tissue ( regardless cancer type ) relationship inhibition SFKs tissue vs. SFKs blood cell also unresolved , correlative study accompany plethora clinical trial assess efficacy drug patient . Furthermore , effect dasatinib stability estrogen receptor tissue express receptor ( uterine breast , particularly ) also unknown . Src kinase show physically associate ER mediate rapid signal effect presence estrogen.6 If physical association also stabilize receptor ( normally degrade upon estrogen stimulation ) , dasatinib could affect estrogen receptor signal indirect manner . In Mayer study , 9 control tumor ER/PR+ , suggest possible relationship ER expression dasatinib response.33 These question unexplored patient . The goal study , therefore , address question provide insight appropriate cancer type action dasatinib SFK alone ER patient sample expose drug . Furthermore , inhibition SFKs blood cell correlate tissue , future study utilize blood sample instead addition tissue monitor dasatinib activity , obviate need extra biopsy surgical sample analysis . The investigator therefore propose Phase 0 study dasatinib patient endometrial cancer undergo plan hysterectomy . The purpose trial therapeutic ; endpoint translational per Phase 0 design . Due potential relationship ER expression , endometrioid tumor study , frequently express receptor ( opposed clear cell serous histology , often express ER estrogen relate ) . Given extensive safety data available dasatinib investigator plan allow dose accepted Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) use across dasatinib program . Based preliminary data Blackwell trial breast cancer34 , adequate inhibition src family kinase questionable dos even high 100 mg ( although study do steady-state 4 week treatment ) ; thus unlikely dos le 100 mg value . The investigator therefore plan begin 100 mg demonstrate safety ( perhaps measurable src inhibition ) escalate 200 mg ( likely result measurable level interest ) assume safety . If feasible investigator would anticipate ability demonstrate dose response assay tissue blood , also require test two dos .</detailed_description>
