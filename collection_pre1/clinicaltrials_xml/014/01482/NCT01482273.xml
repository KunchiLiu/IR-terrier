	<brief_title>Ultrasound-enhanced Thrombolysis Versus Standard Catheter Directed Thrombolysis Ilio-femoral Deep Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) public health problem annual incidence 1 per 1000 . Besides acute risk potentially fatal pulmonary embolism phlegmasia cerulea dolens , patient increase risk recurrent venous thromboembolism , long term 20-40 % develop post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . PTS mainly develop patient DVT affect ilio-femoral vein , adversely affect quality life cause important health care cost society . There 's evidence early removal obstruct thrombus reduces risk develop PTS , high degree thrombolysis associate low incidence PTS , good quality life low risk recurrent venous thromboembolism . Therefore , addition standard anticoagulation therapy , late international guideline recommend catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) first-line treatment patient ilio-femoral DVT low bleeding risk . CDT refers infusion thrombolytic drug directly thrombus via multisidehole catheter embed thrombus use image guidance . A development ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis combine CDT sophisticated catheter system employ high-frequency , low-dose ultrasound . In vitro experiment show add Ultrasound thrombolytic drug accelerate thrombolysis Ultrasound exposure alone result thrombolysis . Although ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis widely use treat ilio-femoral DVT high-risk pulmonary embolism , currently know technique superior standard CDT . Objective To determine addition intravascular high-frequency/low-dose ultrasound standard CDT increase percentage clot lysis compare CDT alone treatment duration 15 hour patient symptomatic ilio-femoral DVT low bleeding risk Methods Study design : open-label ( blind data-analyzing physician ) , randomize , control , single center clinical trial follow-up period 12 month . Subjects : total 20 patient ( 10 study group ) 18-75 year age acute , symptomatic , objectively confirm ilio-femoral DVT low bleeding risk . Intervention : CDT use EkoSonic Endovascular System ( CDT+US group ) without ( CDT-US group ) intravascular high-frequency , low-power ultrasound 15 hour .</detailed_description>
