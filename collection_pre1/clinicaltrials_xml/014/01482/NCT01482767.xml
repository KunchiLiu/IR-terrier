	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Boceprevir , Pegylated-Interferon Alfa 2b Ribavirin Treating Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Infection Adults With HIV HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For HIV-1-infected individual , HCV infection lead cause morbidity mortality , prevalence HCV infection high among infected HIV-1 . At time study design , standard-of-care ( SOC ) therapy HCV infection treatment PEG-IFN RBV . This therapy 40 % -45 % effective patient HCV infection significantly less effective patient HCV HIV-1 ( Shire et al . J Viral Hepat. , 2007 ) . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness add BOC ( Kwo et al . Lancet , 2010 ) , HCV protease inhibitor , SOC therapy treat HCV infection ( genotype 1 ) HCV/HIV-1-coinfected adult . Participants enrol one two group base previous HCV treatment experience . 1 . Group A : HCV treatment-naive participant never receive treatment PEG-IFN experimental agent use treat HCV , without RBV ( N=170 , refer note ) . 2 . Group B : HCV treatment-experienced participant receive treatment standard interferon PEG-IFN without RBV , provide last dose treatment 90 day study entry ( N=140 , refer note ) . Note : The team correspondence FDA lead amendment close enrollment December 2013 , prior target sample size 170 Group A 140 Group B , study power could lower still meet key study objective . All participant stable antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) least 8 week prior study entry use dual nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) backbone plus one following : efavirenz ( EFV ) , raltegravir ( RAL ) , lopinavir ( LPV ) /ritonavir ( RTV ) 400/100 mg twice daily , atazanavir ( ATV ) /RTV , darunavir ( DRV ) /RTV 600/100 mg twice daily OR must receive ART least 4 week immediately prior entry . Participation study last approximately 72 week . HCV treatment-naive participant ( Group A ) treat PEG-IFN RBV 4 week ( lead-in ) . Then BOC add treatment regimen ( triple therapy ) . Cirrhotic participant receive 44 week triple therapy . Among non-cirrhotics , Week 8 HCV RNA use determine total duration therapy . Those undetectable HCV RNA Week 8 complete therapy Week 28 . Those detectable HCV RNA Week 8 receive 32 week triple therapy follow 12 additional week double-drug therapy PEG-IFN/RBV . HCV treatment-experienced participant ( Group B ) also lead-in follow 32 week triple therapy 12 week PEG-IFN/RBV double therapy non-cirrhotic , 44 week triple therapy cirrhotic . Treatment discontinue due HCV virologic failure : 1 . HCV RNA ≥100 IU/mL Week 12 , 2. detectable HCV RNA Week 24 , 3. confirm HCV RNA &gt; 1000 IU/mL time Week 12 . Undetectable HCV RNA define low limit quantification ( LLOQ ) target detect ( TND ) Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test v2.0 . Study visit schedule screening Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 28 study group . Group A participant complete treatment Week 28 study visit Weeks 40 , 52 , 60 , 72 . Participants prescribe 48-weeks therapy ( Group A Group B ) study visit Weeks 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 48 , 60 , 72 . At visit , physical examination blood collection conduct . Participants also complete HCV treatment adherence questionnaire . Select visit include urine collection pregnancy test ( woman reproductive potential ) . Plasma , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) store use future study . After experience HCV virologic failure define premature treatment discontinuation due safety reason , participant follow separate schedule event visit every 12 week Week 24 72 . The evaluation follow-up visit limit safety evaluation store plasma/serum sample collection . The A5294 study consist single-arm evaluation ass efficacy BOC add PEG-IFN/RBV two study population : 1 . HCV treatment-naive participant ( Group A ) 2 . HCV treatment-experienced participant ( Group B ) . The two study population address together single trial - rather two separate trial - mainly administrative efficiency . The analysis conduct separately Study Group . The study design comparison . The pooled summary Baseline Characteristics provide Results Section record prepare solely ClinicalTrials.gov result submission .</detailed_description>
