	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common malignant skin lesion white adult . It slow-growing tumour despite low metastatic potential may cause significant local tissue destruction patient morbidity . Methyl aminolevulinate cream plus photodynamic therapy ( MAL-PDT ) BCC currently approve procedure use 2 treatment session 1 week apart . This procedure consider quite time- resource-consuming . Introducing single treatment session , new PDT session treatment failures 3 month , might represent attractive simplification . This randomise controlled single-blinded multi-centre study primarily aim compare BCC lesion response rate two treatment schedule : ( ) 1 single treatment Metvix-PDT re-treatment non-complete responder 3 month , ( b ) usual schedule 2 standard Metvix ( R ) PDT treatment 1 week apart . Secondary objective investigate treatment response relation clinical histological tumour characteristic tumour thickness , subtype immunohistochemical marker .</brief_summary>
