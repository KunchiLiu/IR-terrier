	<brief_title>Comparing Clinical Performance Novice Trainee Endoscopists Using Conventional Air Insufflation Versus Warm Water Infusion Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective randomize cross-over study university base setting ( University California Davis , Sacramento , California ) diverse patient population . Participants : Total 6 first year gastroenterology trainee ( 3 enrollee per year July 2011 July 2012 ) Recruitment : Trainees ' name contact information acquire via program director . They contact person first day fellowship orientation provide information regard study . Randomization : A sealed envelope contain randomize method ( conventional air insufflation warm water infusion ) open time sign consent study participation . Cross-over Design : Trainees perform colonoscopy use randomized method dedicate attend physician us air and/or water method part standard clinical practice 6 month , point cross-over alternate method colonoscopy another dedicate attend remain 6 month first year fellowship . Air Insufflation Method : The minimal amount air use insertion open lumen . Minimal amount water ( 10 50 mL ) room temperature use wash residual feces . If insertion hinder scope looping , attempt loop reduction make . If advancement occur within 3 5 minute , assistant provide abdominal compression , follow change patient 's position facilitate passage colonoscope . Cecal intubation suggest identification appendiceal orifice ileocecal valve intubation terminal ileum . Warm Water Infusion Method : As first describe Dr. Felix W. Leung , maneuver summarize warm water infusion lieu air insufflation combine suction removal residual colonic air residual feces water exchange . Because insufflated air could lengthen colon exaggerate angulation flexures make insertion difficult , air pump turn insertion colonoscope rectum avoid accidental insufflation air . Further minimization angulation flexures achieve suction removal encounter residual air . Warm water ( 36-37ºC ) maintain use water bath heat saver envelop infuse intermittently use Olympus OFP peristaltic flushing pump via EndoGator auxiliary water port connector disposable water bottle system Olympus scopes . The minimum amount water need distend colon open lumen use scope insertion . When luminal water become turbid due residual feces , discolor water suction replaced clean water lumen visualize . If advancement occur within 3 5 minute , assistant provide abdominal compression , follow change patient 's position facilitate passage colonoscope . Cecal intubation suggest appropriate movement endoscopic image monitor screen right lower quadrant palpated appendiceal orifice visualize water . The cecum distend air confirm visualization ileocecal valve appendiceal orifice . No specific limit set volume water use . Colonoscopy Procedures : Trainees randomize either use conventional air insufflation warm water infusion method perform colonoscopy dedicate endoscopy attend half-day weekly outpatient endoscopy clinic ( main indication colonoscopy screen surveillance ) 6-month study period . Three faculty gastroenterologist participate dedicate research personnel . Patients monitor standard fashion ( include regular nursing assessment vital sign discomfort ) . The sedation nurse administer medication procedure accord patient pain level ( 0=none 10=most severe ) assess every 3-5 minute interval time patient appear discomfort . Standard incremental dos medication ( use either meperidine 25mg fentanyl 25 mcg midazolam 1mg ) offer patient pain level ≥ 2 . The nurse record procedural time ( start time , cecal intubation time , end time minute ) , medication administer ( pre-procedural sedation , procedure start cecal intubation , withdrawal period cecum across anus ) , attend involvement ( hands-on assistance take-over ) . An attending dedicate colonoscopy train present entire duration procedure . Cecum consider reach attend clear-cut cecal landmark identify ( appendiceal orifice , ileocecal valve , intubation terminal ileum ) . In concordance prior study , attend endoscopists allow trainee 20 minute reach cecum , provide examination progress safe manner patient comfortable . If advancement occur within 3 5 minute , assistant provide abdominal compression , follow change patient 's position facilitate passage colonoscope . If trainee reach cecum 20 minute , instructor take cecum reach . The instructor take sooner trainee advance colonoscope 5 minute site , judge patient tolerance become factor . For air water method , unlimited verbal instruction allow instructor may guide trainee description maneuver he/she perform procedure . The instructor provide hands-on assistance either trainee state reached cecum , 20 minute pass , necessary instructor take sooner 20 minute one reason state . After colonoscopy , instructor fill questionnaire regard prior colonic surgery , presence abnormal anatomy mass , polyp detection removal , quality preparation use Boston Bowel Preparation Scale , difficultly procedure ( 1=very easy 5=very difficult ) . Overall assessment trainee 's colonoscopy skill assess instructor procedure ( 1=poor 5=excellent ) . The instructor also indicate whether cecum intubate colonoscopy complete independently trainee , hands-on assistance , attend take-over procedure . The trainee assess ease learn technique ( 1=very easy 5=very difficult ) self-assessment clinical confidence ( 1=not confident 5=extremely confident ) . Record Keeping Standardization : A data collection sheet use study case , include data record sedation nurse ( procedural time , patient pain score , medication administer , instructor involvement , volume water use ) , trainee self-evaluation , attend evaluation case trainee skill . A short post procedural survey provide patient assess post-procedural pain , experience , satisfaction , willingness undergo repeat procedure . In addition photographic image document cecal intubation scan electronic record , digital video recorder use record procedures consultant PI/investigators may review predetermine 10 % case ensure uniform standard reporting time , quality preparation , polyp detection , degree difficulty . Personal identifier remove digital image capture . We track number additional colonoscopy trainee perform part inpatient rotation may later analyze potential confounder . Pathology report remove specimen record adenoma detection rate may determine . Statistical Analysis Plan : Chi-squared ( χ2 ) Fisher 's exact test analysis use compare proportion successful trainee unassisted cecal intubation case ( primary outcome ) conventional air insufflation warm water infusion colonoscopy method . Secondary outcome variable compare use Chi-squared test , Fisher 's exact test Mann Whitney U test appropriate . Multivariate logistic regression analysis use evaluate factor affect cecal intubation time success . We also calculate trainee ' learn curve consecutive block 25 procedure ( air water method ) use one-way variance analysis Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test compare unassisted cecal intubation colonoscopy success rate time require cecal intubation withdrawal previously report conventional air method .</detailed_description>
