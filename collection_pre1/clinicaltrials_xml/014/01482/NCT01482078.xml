	<brief_summary>Magnesium treatment mother protect brain baby bear early . This study investigate combined effect magnesium spinal epidural anesthesia mother cesarean . The investigator use score system measure sedation device subject breath measure breathe strength . The investigator hypothesize combination magnesium anesthesia reduce breathe strength cause sedation . This observational study compare magnesium anesthesia anesthesia . Routine medical care alter . Results hopefully allow anesthesiologist provide good patient care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose Neonatal neuroprotection new indication magnesium . Meta-analysis available literature suggest beneficial neonatal outcome , direct effect maternal health study . Unwanted effect magnesium therapy sedation respiratory insufficiency may potentiate neuraxial anesthesia place mother risk morbidity . 2 . Hypothesis Aim Magnesium cause sedation muscle weakness , potentiate effect neuraxial anesthesia , increase respiratory insufficiency , reduce cough effectiveness increase pulmonary aspiration risk . We hypothesise compare control group , group receive magnesium reduce Maximal Expiratory Pressure ( MEP ) ≥15 cmH2O , 10 % high incidence composite sedation score ≤ 3 . 3 . Justification study There strong evidence medical literature support current guideline practice treat parturients present pre-term delivery , less 34 week magnesium . The presumed benefit reduction incidence functional motor deficit cerebral palsy , possibly reduction infant mortality . Treatment magnesium represent current accepted practice level care . Approximately 50 % pre-term patient require neuraxial anesthesia enable cesarean section , use either intrathecal epidural technique . There potential cumulative side effect neuraxial anesthesia magnesium study do examine . Safety magnesium parturients demonstrate . The effect magnesium know establish therapy management pre-eclampsia . The consequence neuraxial anesthesia also well document . This prospective observational study investigate combine effect magnesium administration neuraxial anesthesia . Of particular interest effect may place parturient increase risk complication , need active assessment management anesthesiologist e.g . risk pulmonary aspiration result sedation , vomit reduce cough effectiveness . In addition effect magnesium neuraxial anesthesia , ventilatory mechanic parturient compromise : - effect gravid uterus , displace diaphragm alter subcostal angle . - supine position operate table impede ventilation gravitational effect abdominal content . - practice `` skin-to-skin '' operating room , sit baby patient 's chest mechanically impede respiratory effort . Although interested potential complication due use magnesium conjunction neuraxial anesthesia , potential advantage magnesium mother , especially epidural , include reduction shiver improve quality analgesia . 4 . Research Method This prospective , observational study comparison control group . Our target population woman deliver cesarean neuraxial anesthesia BC Women 's Hospital . The study group include woman &lt; 34 week receive magnesium neonatal neuroprotection , control group include &gt; 34 week receive magnesium neonatal neuroprotection . We propose study convenience sample 5-month period . In last 3 year BC Women 's Hospital mean 243 delivery per year less 34 week 128 cesarean section . Over 5-month period average number presentation would theoretically possible recruit 50 patient . We realistically expect recruit 20 patient study group . A large pool patient available control group aim recruit number direct power calculation . Sample Size statistical analysis : The sample size choose primary outcome MEP , determine minimum difference mean 15 cmH20 , alpha 0.05 power 0.8 . The two-sample t-test use analyse normally distribute data ( e.g . MEP , MIP , FVC ) . Chi-squared test use compare categorical variable group ( e.g . composite sedation score OAA/S ≤3 &gt; 3 ) . If significant group difference plan undertake regression analysis identify independently contribute effect take account demographic factor . It hop study beneficial increase understanding potential effect combine magnesium neuraxial anesthesia obstetric population present pre-term cesarean section . Highlighting potential risk improve patient safety future . This study certain extent also hypothesis generate nature .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Delivering cesarean section le 34 week gestational age ( maximum 33 week 6 day ) . ≥19 yr Singleton multiple pregnancy There potentially great intraabdominal pressure associate multiple pregnancy , may affect anesthetic block height increase blood volume epidural blood vessel . It may also increase risk basal atelectasis affect respiratory mechanic great extent . We plan undertake subgroup analysis test effect . Primiparous multiparous Englishspeaking Undergoing cesarean section neuraxial anesthesia ( intrathecal , epidural combine spinal epidural [ CSE ] ) . Parturients response may identical different neuraxial technique , e.g . degree respiratory motor blockade exhibit onset opioid effect . Therefore plan undertake subgroup analysis test effect .
