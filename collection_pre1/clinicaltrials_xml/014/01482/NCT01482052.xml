	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety new conjugate vaccine , NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT , compare safety similar , licensed meningococcal A/C/Y/W-135-DT conjugate vaccine . The investigator also evaluate production antibody NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ conjugate vaccine compare licensed vaccine , measure vaccine effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Group A , C , Y &amp; W-135 Meningococcal Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meningococcal disease potentially life-threatening bacterial infection . The disease commonly express either meningococcal meningitis , inflammation membrane surround brain spinal cord , meningococcemia , presence bacteria blood . The common symptom include high fever , headache , neck stiffness , confusion , nausea , vomit , lethargy , rash . If treated disease progress rapidly lead shock death , often within hour onset symptom . Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharide poor immunogen . However , conjugation bacterial polysaccharide immunogenic carrier protein generally result conjugate induce strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune response , create longer-lasting immune response thus protection meningococcal infection . This study compare safety antibody production induce one intramuscular injection either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT license meningococcal A/C/Y/W-135-DT conjugate vaccine . Participants attend screen visit 4 week prior Day 0 , attend study visit 8 week . There study phone call Days 2-3 , post-study telephone call subject assess safety 26 week .</detailed_description>
