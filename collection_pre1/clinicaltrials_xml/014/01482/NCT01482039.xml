	<brief_summary>The investigator propose prospective evaluation method assess cervical length uncomplicated singleton gestation 18-28 week present MFM office routine mid pregnancy ultrasound . The investigator hypothesize sequential approach screen cervix ( consist initial transabdominal evaluation first transvaginal ultrasound reserve patient cervix appear short transabdominal exam adequate view obtain transabdominal approach alone ) take less time , result number adequate view cervix high patient satisfaction universal transvaginal screening approach . OBJECTIVE To determine best strategy cervical length screen uncomplicated singleton gestation gestational age 18-28 week . Primary outcome : 1 ) Time require obtain adequate view cervical length . Secondary outcome : 1 . Patient satisfaction ultrasound experience measure patient questionnaire 2 . Number adequate view cervix obtain approach STUDY DESIGN This prospective study compare strategy cervical length measurement uncomplicated singleton gestation see MFM office routine mid pregnancy fetal well ultrasound 18-28 week gestation . The different strategy include 1 ) Transabdominal assessment cervix ( current standard ) , 2 ) Sequential evaluation cervical length ( transabdominal follow transvaginal necessary due short cervix inadequate transabdominal view ) , 3 ) Transvaginal cervical length assessment . Patients uncomplicated singleton gestation present routine mid pregnancy ultrasound 18-28 week randomize one three group note consent obtain . Ultrasound examination take place data collect . The various strategy list compare follow : 1 . Time require obtain view cervix 1 . Time initiation exam completion cervical assessment 2 . Time completion entire exam 2 . Patient satisfaction 1 . Comfort/Discomfort exam procedure 2 . Overall impression exam process 3 . Number adequate view cervix obtain Maternal demographic include age , parity , weight , height due date/gestational age also obtain consent patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Preterm birth significant problem United States worldwide . Approximately twelve percent birth US occur 37 week consider preterm . Of , 80 % consider `` spontaneous preterm delivery '' ( oppose iatrogenic ) relate preterm labor preterm rupture membrane ( Arias , 2003 ) . Certain pregnancy characteristic identify determine patient risk preterm delivery . These include history preterm birth ( Esplin , 2008 ) , uterine anomaly , multiple gestation , among thing , modifiable ( Gardosi , 2000 ; Ananth , 2006 ) . However , important risk factor identify presence specific change cervix , cervical shortening , fact , study indicate risk spontaneous preterm birth increase cervical length decrease ( Iams , 1996 ; Hibbard , 2000 ) . Some author advocate universal screen pregnant woman cervical shortening time ultrasound perform 18-28 week woman . However , best approach evaluate cervix low risk patient ( without identifiable risk factor ) remain controversial . PROTOCOL 1 . Patients identify Maternal Fetal Medicine office consent randomization time presentation previously schedule mid-trimester ultrasound 2 . Patients give randomly generate treatment allocation within seal opaque envelope . Once patient consent enter trial , envelope open ultrasonographer determine assign treatment regimen . 3 . Patients randomize one three group : 1 . Standard US evaluation 2 . Sequential US evaluation 3 . Transvaginal cervical length screen 4 . Maternal demographic include maternal age , height , weight , parity , gestational age collect patient part patient questionnaire . Ultrasound exam data include measurement fetal biometry , presence fetal anomaly , placental location amniotic fluid volume collect official ultrasound report . 1 . Patients assign unique study ID number time enrollment information include time ultrasound procedure , clinical data adequacy cervical measurement link ID number 2 . All data enter electronic data base de-identified fashion keep secure , encrypt web-based database management program ( RedCap ) .</detailed_description>
