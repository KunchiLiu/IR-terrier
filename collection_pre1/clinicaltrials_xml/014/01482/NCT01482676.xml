	<brief_title>The Role microRNAs Organ Remodeling Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Urgency , frequency incomplete empty key symptom low urinary tract ( LUT ) dysfunction , include bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis ( BPS ) , overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) . Detrusor overactivity , cause symptom overactive bladder syndrome , commonly observe patient bladder outlet obstruction . LUT dysfunction associate cellular stress , characterise change cell signal consequent alteration gene expression lead organ remodelling . Previously investigator show NK1R-mediated signal down-regulated BPS patient , implicate microRNAs ( miRNAs ) regulation NK1R expression function . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) quickly gain recognition role many biological process disease state . MiRNAs endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNAs regulate gene expression post-transcriptional mechanism . The microRNAs regulate thousand human gene product , complicate effort predict functionally validate target . Since miRNAs important many basic biological process , deregulation biogenesis function may develop medical condition . Here investigator propose investigate role miRNAs gene regulation LUT disorder . Chronic BPS clinical syndrome characterise urgency/frequency , pelvic pain inflammation absence detectable agent . A multitude pathogenetic mechanism postulate , inflammatory component commonly think involve . Epithelial damage often invoke : mucinous layer healthy bladder often compromise patient BPS . An initiating event ( toxin ) may cause increase urothelial permeability , turn lead nerve sensitisation . The result cell injury propagates , lead self-perpetuating inflammatory reaction . Urgency pivotal symptom lower urinary tract , also one bothersome symptom men suffer benign prostatic hyperplasia result bladder outlet obstruction ( BOO ) . In woman OAB dynamic disorder , estimate 34 % woman 40 experience significant urinary storage symptom . In contrast BPS , patient overactivity report bladder pain , although perception urgency arise discomfort vary individual . In order facilitate diagnosis BPS distinction DO , offer specific treatment regimen disorder , important unravel mechanism behind pathophysiology disease . The investigator ' previous result suggest diseased state human urinary bladder concomitant structural functional change smooth muscle urothelium . In obstructed bladder , organ 's adaptive response often accompanied replacement smooth muscle contractile proteins non-muscle embryonic isoforms . On hand , continuous exposure neurotransmitter low pH inflammation BPS induce significant down-regulation tachykinin receptor tight junction protein , might mediate up-regulated miRNAs . The investigator propose establish individual gene expression pattern characteristic BPS overactive well acontractile bladder determine common mechanism cellular stress response . They study role miRNAs regulation receptor-mediated signalling , contractility epithelial integrity LUT dysfunction , delineate miRNA specie , characteristic symptomatic complex . Based information , identify functionally validate gene target miRNAs urinary bladder order foster development customise therapy . By compare expression regulatory miRNAs overactive acontractile bladder investigator delineate factor influence switch two programme . Using validated miRNA/mRNA target pair cell base model urothelium bladder smooth muscle , investigate persistent stress-induced signal disease affect miRNA expression function target protein . The finding extend knowledge molecular mechanism LUT dysfunction implication diagnosis treatment disorder . Patient selection sample processing : Four study group define accord international guideline ICS terminology : control , BPS , overactive acontractile . Twenty clinically stable patient pro study group recruit base clinical finding ( international prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) , bladder diary 48 h , O'Leary-Sant questionnaire visual analogue scale pain ) . Biopsies obtain either general spinal anesthesia transurethrally bladder dome biopsy tong . Biopsies snap frozen liquid nitrogen submerge RNAlater ( Qiagen ) . All patient undergo surgery independent study . Tissue bladder dome primary cell culture obtain patient undergo cystectomy bladder augmentation bladder dysfunction last therapeutic option less invasive therapeutic option fail . Control tissue obtain bladder cancer patient , low urinary tract symptom aside hematuria . RNA extract , expression level select gene analyze use Taqman realtime PCR gene expression array ( Applied Biosystems ) . Calcium image use monitor receptor activation protein level analyse SDS-PAGE Western Blotting . Receptor tissue distribution analyse immunocytochemistry . Objective To identify functionally validate gene target miRNAs urinary bladder order foster development customise therapy . By compare expression regulatory miRNAs overactive acontractile bladder investigator delineate factor influence switch two programme . Using validated miRNA/mRNA target pair cell base model urothelium bladder smooth muscle , investigate persistent stress-induced signal disease affect miRNA expression function target protein . The finding extend knowledge molecular mechanism LUT dysfunction implication diagnosis treatment disorder . Methods RNA extract , expression level select gene analyze use Taqman realtime PCR gene expression array ( Applied Biosystems ) .
