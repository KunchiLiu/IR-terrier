	<brief_summary>The HIP trial large pragmatic , multinational , randomised trial two different strategy management hypotension extremely low gestational age newborn ( Standard dopamine versus restrict placebo approach ) . HYPOTHESIS : A restricted approach management hypotension extremely low gestational age newborn result improved neonatal long-term developmental outcome . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine whether restricted approach management hypotension compare use dopamine first line pressor agent infant bear less 28 week gestation within first 72 hr birth ( transitional period ) , improve survival without significant brain injury 36 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) improve survival without moderate severe neurodevelopmental disability 2 year correct age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While hypotension - low blood pressure ( BP ) - commonly diagnose treated preterm infant enormous variation clinical practice.Hypotension statistically associated adverse short-term long-term outcome however systematic review literature unable find clear criterion define hypotension . In addition evidence support current management strategy minimal mostly dependent small study measure short-term physiologic endpoint . Preterm infant diagnose treat low BP often biochemical clinical sign shock , may normal systemic blood flow , low systemic vascular resistance , adequate tissue oxygen delivery probably require treatment . Careful observation infant without intervention approach previously coin `` permissive hypotension '' may well appropriate . Excessive intervention preterm infant may unnecessary even harmful . Analysis large neonatal database ( Canadian Neonatal Network , CNN ) demonstrate treatment hypotension associate increase serious brain injury . This remain true even mean BP include regression model suggest may treatment hypotension rather presence hypotension harmful . The common approach treatment give one fluid boluses follow dopamine . However , observational data show association fluid bolus administration intracranial bleed animal model correction hypotension rapid volume infusion result intraventricular haemorrhage ; complication associate increased rate death neurosensory impairment preterm human infant . Fluctuations BP follow commencement inotropes well recognise could also trigger intraventricular haemorrhage . Furthermore dopamine commonly use inotrope effect many physiologic function include pituitary effect lead secondary hypothyroidism know risk factor poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcome preterm infant . In addition dopamine elevate BP newborn predominantly due vasoconstriction , may associate reduction systemic perfusion . There consensus definition hypotension preterm infant . Many clinician rely absolute BP value alone guide intervention . BP reference range often base birth weight , gestational age postnatal age criterion . These statistically determine value vary considerably base observation BP make small cohort infant majority bear widespread implementation important perinatal intervention ( e.g antenatal glucocorticoid therapy ) know improve outcome reduce incidence intraventricular haemorrhage preterm infant . The Joint Working Group British Association Perinatal Medicine recommend mean arterial BP mmHg maintain gestational age week ( e.g . infant born 25 week gestation mean BP &gt; 25mmHg ) . Despite little publish evidence support 'rule ' , remain common criterion use define hypotension use number recent randomise therapeutic intervention trial sole entry criterion . However , Cunningham et al show poor relationship criterion incidence intraventricular haemorrhage preterm infant . In separate study , CNN report 52 % preterm infant birth weight &lt; 1500g mean arterial BP less gestational age first day life thus may diagnose treated hypotension . It uncertain whether hypotension ( however define ) result adverse clinical outcome include adverse short-term outcome ( increase incidence intraventricular haemorrhage ) adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome . Furthermore unclear whether intervention treat hypotension result improve outcomes . Dopamine commonly use agent , endogenous catecholamine cause vasoconstriction elevates BP , show improve clinical outcome . Epinephrine another endogenous catecholamine , low moderate dos cause vasodilatation stimulates cardiac function . It may increase perfusion use hypotensive neonate data limit . Current standard approach evaluation treatment transitional circulatory problem preterm infant evidence base . It essential approach adequately investigated risk group infant .</detailed_description>
