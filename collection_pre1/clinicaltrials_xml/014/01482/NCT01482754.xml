	<brief_summary>This observational prospective cohort study design evaluate safety rapid Rituximab infusion 90 minute Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) patient . The secondary aim measure number reject chemotherapy administration schedule . Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient tolerate well least 2 cycle standard infusion Rituximab without grade 3 4 adverse event recruit study . In study , first 20 % total dose rituximab administer 30 minute . When subject tolerate infusion stable vital sign , remain 80 % total dose administer 60 minute . Prior administration Rituximab , premedication give subject include PO Paracetamol 1g , IV Diphenhydramine 25/50mg and/or IV Hydrocortisone 100mg . The duration subject involvement study approximately take 72 hour . Adverse event occur within first 24 hour infusion evaluate related Rituximab infusion subject receive combination chemotherapy rituximab . This study recruit patient out-patients . A phone call monitor subject 's health make post 24 , 48 , 72 hour rituximab infusion . The finding study add evidence safety rapid Rituximab infusion 90 minute . If outcome favourable , NUH consider adopt new infusion rate Rituximab infusion patient tolerate least 2 cycle standard infusion recommend drug manufacturer . The study hypothesize rapid Rituximab infusion 90 minute safe NHL patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Rituximab Infusion 90-minute Among Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommended guideline Rituximab infusion first cycle commence infusion rate 50mg/hr first 30 minute . If tolerate well , subsequent increment step 50mg/hr every 30 minute maximum dose 400mg/hr . For second subsequent infusion , infusion rate commences 100mg/hr 30 minute increment 100mg/hr maximum dose 400mg/hr . The first subsequent infusion generally complete 5-6 3-4 hour respectively . Lengthy infusion translate high cost longer wait time patient due scant resource . Therefore , grow interest globally shorten overall infusion time either 90 60-minutes . A recent systematic review evaluate safety rapid Rituximab infusion confirm Rituximab 90-minutes safe NHL patient . However 60-minute infusion recommend neither NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient due lack evidence . Although rapid Rituximab infusion 90-minute test among Singapore population National Cancer Centre , evaluate among cohort patient receive treatment National University Hospital Singapore . As rapid Rituximab infusion remain label use , research study intend evaluate safety rapid Rituximab infusion 90-minute among NHL patient . The select dos 375mg/m2 recommend approve FDA .</detailed_description>
