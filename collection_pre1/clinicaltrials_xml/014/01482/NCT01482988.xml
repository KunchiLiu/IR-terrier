	<brief_title>Role Polymorphisms Dectin-1 Gene Determining Risk Candida Colonization Infection Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive fungal infection associate increased morbidity mortality rate high 50 % ( 1 ) . Up half occur non-neutropenic ; critically ill patient majority due Candida specie . A number randomise control trial ( RCTs ) evaluate anti-fungal prophylaxis , predominantly fluconazole critically ill patient three systematic review RCTs perform ( 2-4 ) . Meta-analyses demonstrate homogeneous effect anti-fungal prophylaxis risk proven infection suggest reduction mortality . However widespread use anti-fungal drug expensive , promote resistance , cause shift pathogenic specie towards difficult treat infection may associate adverse drug relate event . It necessary establish method identify patient great risk fungal infection thus benefit anti-fungal prophylaxis . Numerous risk factor identify include colonization , class/duration antibiotic , number/location/duration line , total parenteral nutrition , gastric acid suppression , bacterial sepsis , post-surgical complication etc , none accurately predict infection fungal relate mortality . Given risk factor fungal colonisation include infection , sepsis antibiotic use , information regard concomitant antibody deficiency also collect use calculate globulin ( part routine liver function test ) immunoglobulin . Recent evidence suggest fungi modulate evade host immunity use surface molecule cod immune response gene enable promote protective tolerance lead colonisation persistence ( 5 ) . Genetic predisposition infection may associate polymorphism immune response gene . Many polymorphisms relate single difference one single nucleotide define position DNA sequence . These single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) common occurrence within human genome although frequency vary markedly accord ethnic geographical background . A single SNP may alter innate adaptive immunity increase risk invasive fungal disease . Dectin-1 C-type lectin receptor play central role host defence candidal infection . A common polymorphism gene cod Dectin-1 identify associate functional defect immune response increase risk candidal infection ( 6 ) . Dectin-1 recognizes ÃŸ-1,3-glucan cell wall synergizes toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) TLR2 TLR4 promote Th1 Th17 responses activate anti-fungal host defence . It suggest Dectin-1 role resistance tolerance fungal infection ( 7 ) . A polymorphism ( Tyr238X ) exon 6 Dectin-1 gene , result early stop codon leading loss last 10 amino acid extracellular domain , identify lead diminish bind capacity . This mutation think present around 14 % population allele frequency 8 % ( 8 ) . Although data UK population limit , heterozygosity mutation link recurrent mucocutaneous candidal infection increase colonization rate ( 6 ) . Although link invasive disease establish yet , colonization major risk factor causal link postulate . More study need investigate inform strategy prophylaxis pre-emptive anti-fungal treatment . Screening patient Dectin-1 polymorphism investigate allele frequency UK population provide information SNP risk factor fungal infection also enable build rule-based algorithm identify high-risk patient would benefit anti-fungal prophylaxis and/or target molecular diagnostics . The association primary acquire immunodeficiency susceptibility fungal infection also long recognise ( 9 ) measurement antibody Candida albicans use screen test humoral immunodeficiency patient ( 10 ) . Perturbations immunoglobulin level extensively study critically ill patient . However two small observational study demonstrate hypogammaglobulinaemia relatively common patient septic shock admission critical care associate increased mortality ( 11 12 ) . However , unclear whether consequence critical illness predisposition individual make susceptible critical illness . Calculated globulin ( total protein - albumin ) form part liver function test routinely perform hospital use Wales basis screen previously undiagnosed primary secondary immunodeficiency . Calculated globulin utilised way identify patient low ( &lt; 18g/dl ) immunoglobulin level hospital critical care admission . Changes immunoglobulin track throughout critical illness use calculate globulin additional analysis perform selected patient subtle defect humoral immunity .</detailed_description>
