	<detailed_description>Lysosomal storage disorder inborn error metabolism characterize defect lysosomal function . Lysosomes contain acid hydrolases whose function break complex molecule cell simple one . A deficiency activity enzymes result progressive accumulation substance cause storage disease . Pompe disease progressive muscle disease often fatal , caused deficiency lysosomal alpha glucosidase ( also know acid maltase ) activity . This lead accumulation glycogen many tissue , notably skeletal cardiac tissue muscle tissue . It therefore also glycogen storage disease ( type II ) . It inherit autosomal recessive manner first lysosomal storage disease identify . The incidence rate varies geographic area ethnic group , estimate 1/300,000 1:40,000 . It broad clinical spectrum varies respect age onset , rate progression extent organ involvement . The adult onset form occur second sixth decade life form proximal myopathy , predominantly pelvic girdle area . Sometimes first symptom shortness breath diaphragm weakness herald progressive proximal muscle weakness . The heart liver affect . Serum CK ( Creatine Kinase ) activity 2 10 time high normal . EMG ( electromyogram ) test usually reveals myopathic pattern muscle biopsy may show vacuole contain accumulation glycogen broken . Until fairly recently , assay acid maltase activity use cultured fibroblast biopsy skin muscle tissue require diagnosis , leukocytes contain renal isoenzyme absent patient mask deficit result false negative . In recent year problem ben solve introduction acarbose , inhibitor renal α-glucosidase ; also use dried blood spot method , measure acid maltase activity use maltose acarbose inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferyl-D-glucopyranoside substrate . Diagnosis base clinical suspicion , determination lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase activity confirmation mutation gene enzyme , locate chromosome 17 . Glycogenosis type II multisystem disorder therefore require multidisciplinary approach treatment . Motor recovery , ventilatory support nutritional management patient gastrointestinal involvement , see fundamental treatment . Since 2.000 , enzyme replacement therapy alpha-alglucosidase use , whose safety effectiveness , especially childhood , publish several paper .</detailed_description>
