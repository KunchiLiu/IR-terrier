	<brief_summary>A recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( rAAV2 ) vector alter carry human MERTK ( hMERTK ) gene . This vector show restore vision animal model resemble human MERTK-associated Retinitis Pigmentosa ( RP ) , incurable retinal degeneration cause severe vision loss . The propose study open label , Phase I clinical trial subretinal rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK administration individual MERTK-associated retinal disease . This trial lead great understanding safety thereby potential value gene transfer MERTK-associated retinal disease implication form retinal degenerative disease amenable type intervention .</brief_summary>
