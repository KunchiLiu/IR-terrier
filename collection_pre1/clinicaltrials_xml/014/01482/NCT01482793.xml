	<brief_summary>The objective study gather data regard efficacy , safety cost-effectiveness percutaneous vertebroplasty acute fracture group fracture less 6 week old . The AVAMAX vertebroplasty kit ( Care Fusion ) use vertebroplasties . The primary effectiveness analysis base number patient whose numeric rating pain score drop 7 10 baseline 4 10 two week post-intervention . Our hypothesis vertebroplasty group significantly large proportion patient achieve pain reduction control group . A secondary analysis compare change mean pain score specific activity related pain score two group 3 day , 14 day 1 , 3 6 month . Another secondary effectiveness analysis include mean change back-pain specific limitation function quantify Roland Scale data collection time point .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Controlled Trial Vertebroplasty Acute Painful Osteoporotic Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study two arm randomise , blind placebo control trial vertebroplasty acute ( &lt; 6 week ) osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture . Patients substantial pain immobility despite medical therapy recruit study , randomise study treatment follow 6 month . The primary effectiveness variable back-pain record numerical verbal rating scale two week post-procedure . Secondary effectiveness variable Roland Morris back pain specific disability score . In parallel trial economic analysis conduct . Study participant recruit patient refer vertebroplasty evaluation five clinical site Sydney metropolitan area . The site St George Private Hospital , Kareena Private Hospital , St George Public Hospital , Sutherland Hospital Liverpool Hospital . These site advantage robust , establish vertebroplasty program high level technical operator experience vertebroplasty acute fracture . Potential patient patient identified recent vertebral fracture require assessment vertebroplasty . The refer physician request MRI spinal radiograph part routine assessment standard clinical care . Potential involvement study discuss point patient refer physician . Patients give consent form read consider . The research team contact potential subject ask series question determine eligibility . The investigator research coordinator describe study eligible patient informed consent obtain prior conduct baseline evaluation randomization . Treatment Intervention ( Vertebroplasty Procedure ) : 5.1.1 The procedure perform strict aseptic condition . All personnel wear surgical mask cap addition gown glove operator , minimize risk infection . 1G ceftriaxone administer commencement procedure unless patient allergic . In case allergy antibiotic mandatory . 5.1.2 The patient place prone angiographic table oxygen mask apply . Conscious sedation induce IV administration fentanyl midazolam . 5.1.3 Continuously monitor heart rate pulse oximetry throughout procedure . 5.1.4 Standard fluoroscopy dedicate DSA interventional fluoroscope use localization vertebral body treat ( Levels T4-L5 ) needle placement within vertebral body . 5.1.5 A 25g needle use raise wheal 1 % lignocaine subcutaneously . A small skin nick make scalpel blade . A 25g needle place skin site wheal advance fluoroscopic guidance periosteum pedicle . This periosteum infiltrate 6-7 cc 1 % lignocaine . ( Injections make fracture level , i.e. , 2 separate injection perform patient 2 fracture level . ) 5.1.6 A small incision make skin vicinity pedicle , access needle position transpedicular approach . 5.1.7 13G 11G vertebroplasty needle place use trans-pedicular para-pedicular approach anterior one third vertebral body . Whether unilateral bilateral approach use discretion radiologist procedure , bi-pedicular approach recommend T12 vertebral body lumbar vertebral body ( due increase size ) . An effort make fill fracture fragment vertebral body normal trabecular component order stop ongoing fracture volume loss . 5.1.8 Prepare AVAMAXâ„¢ inject system approve manner per system instruction . Wait 5 minute mix cement cement injection allow optimal viscosity prior commence injection . Product accountability form complete include batch number . 5.1.9 Cement injection perform use continuous fluoroscopic screen lateral projection . Cement injection continue adequate vertebral body fill obtain . This ideally mean cement fill superior inferior vertebral body end-plate least anterior three quarter vertebral body lateral projection . In frontal projection , cement reach least middle pedicle middle contra-lateral pedicle distribution consider adequate ( radiologist ) stabilize acute fracture . Upon completion injection , cannula remove haemostasis puncture site achieve gentle pressure . If adequate fill obtain , place another needle contra lateral pedicle treat fashion . 5.1.10 Patient leave prone position 3 minute follow cement injection allow cement harden . 5.1.11 Contingency plan outpatient sudden life threaten event occur radiology suite require immediate medical surgical attention : patient examine appropriate life support measure institute . In case suspect spinal cord compromise , immediate CT scan surgical consultation make . In case hemodynamic compromise idiosyncratic reaction , life support institute . 5.2 Control Intervention : 5.2.1 The procedure perform strict aseptic condition . All personnel wear surgical mask cap addition gown glove operator , minimize risk infection simulate true vertebroplasty . Prophylactic antibiotic may administer treat physician accord usual practice , mandate study protocol . 5.22 The patient place prone angiographic table oxygen mask apply . Conscious sedation induce IV administration fentanyl , morphine pethidine midazolam . 5.2.3 Continuously monitor heart rate pulse oximetry throughout procedure . 5.2.4 Standard fluoroscopy use localization vertebral body treat ( Levels T4-L5 ) needle placement within vertebral body . 5.2.5 A 25g needle use raise wheal 1 % lignocaine subcutaneously . A skin incision measure approximately 5mm make . The 25G needle reintroduce 2 cc 1 % lignocaine inject subcutaneous tissues.. ( These sham injection make fracture level , i.e. , 2 separate injection perform patient 2 fracture level . ) 5.2.6 Verbal clue give , include limited comment needle placement and/or cement injection progress appropriately . Manual palpation area fracture do simulate needle placement . 5.2.8 The procedure terminate . ( Note : The patient unaware whether control procedure vertebroplasty perform since full sterile preparation , sedation simulate injection procedure use . 5.2.9 Contingency plan outpatient sudden life threaten limb threaten event occur radiology suite require immediate medical surgical attention : patient examine appropriate life support measure institute . In case suspect spinal cord compromise , immediate CT scan surgical consultation make . In case hemodynamic compromise idiosyncratic reaction life support institute . 5.3 Post Operative Care : 5.3.1 Following procedure , patient observe supine position least one hour . 5.3.2 Patients may gradually sit and/or stand next hour , tolerate , direct nursing physician supervision . 5.3.3 Outpatients may discharge care adult 2 hour . 5.3.4 Non-narcotic pain medication may take needed , patient encourage limit use narcotic efficacy determine . 5.3.5 One hour procedure , patient evaluate pain , complication procedure . Vital sign also record . 5.3.6 If determine necessary physician , outpatient may admit monitor overnight hospital . The reason keep patient overnight document post treatment assessment form serious adverse event form . 5.3.7 Evaluation potential complication conduct immediately appropriate treatment institute . 5.3.8 Dressings apply injection/incision site may remove follow day . 5.3.9 Skin incision keep clean dry . Patients notify physician redness discharge . 5.3.10 Inpatients continue manage attend physician usual fashion . 5.4 Patient Evaluations &amp; Follow Up Examinations We administer follow measure pain pain-related disability questionnaire : numeric visual pain-rating scale , Roland-Morris Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire , Osteoporosis Quality Life Questionnaire ( QUALEFFO ) , SF-36 EQ-5D subject trial . We also ask patient use medication , health care resource , medical history , co-morbidities demographic . A timed go test , reliable measure function old people , complete patient clinic visit baseline , day 14 month 6 . After obtain informed consent baseline consultation , patient ask demographic information patient questionnaire administer face-to-face interview . The two week six month interview also ask person research staff patient visit . The interview ( Days 3 , day 7 , week 4 month 3 ) conduct telephone participant sit . An exception inpatient remain hospital day 3 may interview bedside* .</detailed_description>
