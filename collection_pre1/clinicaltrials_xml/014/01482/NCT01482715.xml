Part 2A ( Completed Enrollment ) Part 2B ( Currently Enrolling ) - The purpose second part study determine safety clinical activity RP2D oral rucaparib administer daily patient know deleterious BRCA mutation ( germline somatic ) . Part 3 ( Completed Enrollment ) - The purpose third part study evaluate PK high dose strength tablet RP2D patient advance solid tumor , inclusive lymphoma , evidence BRCA mutation ( germline somatic ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Oral Rucaparib Patients With Solid Tumor ( Phase I ) With gBRCA Mutation Ovarian Cancer ( Phase II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rucaparib ( CO-338 ; formerly know PF 01367338 AG 14699 ) orally available , small molecule inhibitor poly-adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] ribose polymerase ( PARP ) develop treatment ovarian cancer associate homologous recombination [ HR ] DNA repair deficiency ( HRD ) . The safety efficacy rucaparib evaluate several Phase 1 Phase 2 study . An oral formulation focus current development effort . Rucaparib currently investigate monotherapy patient cancer associate BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . For study , anticipate rucaparib promote cell death BRCA-deficient tumor cell ovarian cancer patient evidence germline mutation , thereby limit tumor progression provide therapeutic benefit .</detailed_description>
