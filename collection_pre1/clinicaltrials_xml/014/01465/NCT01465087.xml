	<detailed_description>MS common chronic neurological disease affect young adult , onset usually age 20-40 year . Women affect 3-4 time men . It complex multi-factorial disease , underlie genetic environmental factor . Different population different susceptibility ( Compston Coles 2008 ) . The disease characterize 2 main phenotype : relapsing-remitting progressive course . Clinical disability due destruction CNS myelin ( mainly oligodendrocytes ) due 3 process ( Franklin 2002 ; Franklin Ffrench-Constant 2008 ; Frischer , Bramow et al . 2009 ) : 1 . Inflammation- immune cell aberrant activity invade brain spinal cord cause destruction CNS myelin ( process call demyelination secondary neurodegeneration - axonal neuronal loss ) 2 . Primary neurodegeneration ( axonal neuronal loss ) - without prominent inflammation 3 . Repair - inflammatory neurodegenerative process follow attempt CNS repair - however , partial incomplete repair often basis residual deficit disability ( Chandran , Hunt et al . 2008 ) . - The acute MS relapse ( present paralysis , visual loss , etc . ) - consider due aberrant acute immune activation inflammatory process CNS . - The chronic accumulating disability - consider due Neuro-degenerative process . Repair process mainly note acute relapse - recovery function spontaneous . However , severe relapse sometimes need STEROID TREATMENT ( Tischner Reichardt 2007 ) . Following increase understanding disease , new immunotherapy develop ( COPAXON / ; Interferon -beta ) last 10-15 year long term treatment . However attenuate disease ( reduce number relapse per year ) cure . In addition , beneficial ~40 % Relapsing -Remitting patient . Currently treatments patient Progressive Disease - gradual increase disability ( Murray 2006 ) . Presently biomarkers available diagnosis routine follow-up MS. Oligoclonal IgG CSF - help confirm diagnosis , require invasive procedure correlate disease activity response therapy ; MRI , allow monitor MS activity response treatment expensive routine use ( Link Huang 2006 ; Murray 2006 ) . Dr Hossam Haick Technion , develop electronic nose diagnosis disease via breath sample . Dr Haick 's previous study show electronic nose base gold nanoparticles could form basis inexpensive non- invasive diagnostic tool lung cancer ( Peng , Tisch et al . 2009 ) kidney disease ( Haick , Hakim et al . 2009 ) . Research hypothesis Biomarkers CNS inflammation and/or neurodegeneration and/or CNS repair detect `` electronic nose '' breath sample person MS . Aim ( ) Identification biomarkers : 1 . CNS inflammation CNS-autoimmunity 2 . Neurodegeneration 3 . CNS repair - may serve marker : disease ( vs control ) , disease activity ( predict aggressive disease course , predict Relapse ; predict Malignant v Benign MS ) ; response therapy ( Steroid , immunotherapy neuroprotective agent ) . Work plan outline : Evaluate group clinically : - MS patient acute relapse pre - vs- 7 ,30 90 day steroid treatment - ass indicator acute inflammatory process effect Steroid treatment . - Relapsing MS patient vs Progressive MS patient vs control include healthy individual well patient suffer neurological autoimmune disease MS - ass inflammatory vs neurodegenerative indicator . - MS patient Good- vs Poor- Responders immunotherapy Steroids . BREATH COLLECTION : Alveolar breath volunteer collect use `` offline '' method effectively separate endogenous exogenous breath volatile biomarkers exclude nasal entrainment . Two bag 750 ml breath sample per volunteer collect inert Mylar bag ( Eco Medics , Duerten , Switzerland ) . Vapor sample perform extended breath sample collection apparatus 15-20 minute , several stop process . The first three minute breath sample discard due possible contamination upper respiratory air . The subsequent deep air retain test purpose . The sample collect tube introduce volunteer 's mouth connect collection bag . All participant provide sign informed consent study , perform follow approval accord guideline Helsinki Committee Carmel Medical Center Technion 's committee supervision experiment human . CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BREATH SAMPLES : Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry ( GCMS-QP2010 ; Shimadzu Corporation , Japan ) , combine thermal desorption system ( TD20 ; Shimadzu Corporation , Japan ) , use chemical analysis breath sample . A Tenax® TA adsorbent tube ( Sigma Aldrich Ltd. ) employ pre-concentrating VOCs breath sample . Using custom-made pump system , breath sample Mylar bag suck TA tube 100 ml/min flow rate , transfer thermal desorption ( TD ) tube ( Sigma Aldrich Ltd. ) analyze GC-MS . The follow oven temperature profile set : ( ) 10 min 35°C ; ( b ) 4°C/min ramp 150°C ; ( c ) 10°C/min ramp 300°C ; ( ) 15 min 300°C . An SLB-5ms capillary column ( Sigma Aldrich Ltd. ) 5 % phenyl methyl siloxane ( 30 length , 0.25 mm internal diameter 0.5 μm thickness ) employ . The splitless injection mode use 2 min , 30 cm/sec constant linear speed 0.70 ml/min column flow . The molecular structure VOCs determine via standard modular set , use 10 ppm isobutylene ( Calgaz , Cambridge , Maryland , USA ) standard calibration gas run . GC-MS chromatogram analysis realize use GCMS solution version 2.53SU1 post-run analysis program ( Shimadzu Corporation ) , employ National Institute Standards Technology ( NIST ) compound library ( Gaithersburg , MD 20899-1070 , USA ) . SENSING MEASUREMENTS : Upon interaction breath sample detector , volatile organic compound adsorb organic part sense material The result adsorption translate electrical signal ( resistance ) transmit macro-world ( e.g. , screen device ) ( semi- ) conductive material find film . The result present computer screen . An automated system control custom LabView ( National Instruments ) program use perform sense measurement . The sensor test simultaneously , exposure chamber , use Agilent 34980A multifunction switch . A Stanford Research System SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier control IEEE 488 bus use supply AC voltage signal ( 0.2 V 1 kHz ) measure correspond current ( &lt; 10μA studied device ) . This setup allow measure normalize change conductance small 0.01 % . Sensor resistance continuously acquire experiment . Sensing experiment continuously perform use subsequent exposure cycle ( see SOI , section 2 ) . DATA ANALYSIS : Features extraction . For VOC analysis , three parameter extract sensor response : ( ) normalize change sensor resistance middle exposure ( S1 ) ; ( ii ) normalize change sensor resistance end exposure ( S2 ) ; ( iii ) area response curve ( S3 ) . S1 S2 calculate regard value sensor resistance prior exposure . For breath analysis , two parameter extract sensor response ( either control VOC release breath sample ) : ( ) normalize change sensor resistance soon exposure ( S4 ) ; ( ii ) normalize change sensor resistance middle exposure ( S5 ) . S4 S5 calculate regard value sensor resistance prior exposure . A compensation calibration process posteriorly apply parameter retain sensor response information relate response VOCs breath sample . The mean value parameter obtain two successive exposure sample calculate .</detailed_description>
