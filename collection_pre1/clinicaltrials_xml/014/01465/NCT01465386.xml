	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine bortezomib give maintenance therapy six month post-remission improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 50 % ( 4.5 month ) first remission patient high-risk AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival ( OS ) maintenance therapy bortezomib first remission AML patient . II . To assess safety tolerability subcutaneous ( SC ) administration bortezomib give maintenance therapy first remission AML patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib SC day 1 , 8 , 15 22 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 2 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
