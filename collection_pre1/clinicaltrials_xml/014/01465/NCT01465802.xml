	<criteria>Advanced NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . For Cohort I Cohort II , advance NSCLC patient must receive least one prior regimen systemic therapy include least one standard chemotherapy advance NSCLC fail ( ie , progressed intolerant due toxicity precludes treatment ) standard therapy advance metastatic disease . To consider intolerant treatment , patient must receive least two cycle consider previously treat . For Cohort III , advance NSCLC patient must receive prior systemic treatment advance disease require know EGFR ( HER1 ) mutation , HER2 mutation HER2 amplification . Cohort III patient could receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy Stage IIII disease combine modality chemotherapyradiation Stage IIIA disease allow treatment complete &gt; 12 month prior enrollment . All cohort , patient must evidence disease ; however , measurable disease require enroll . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 02 Estimated creatinine clearance â‰¥15 mL/min . Prior treatment EGFRtargeted HERtargeted agent ( cohort ) . Chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological investigational agent within 2 week baseline disease assessment ( cohort ) . Patients know diffuse interstitial lung disease ( cohort ) . Investigational therapy treatment advance NSCLC without administration approve chemotherapy advance NSCLC ( Cohort I Cohort II )</criteria>
