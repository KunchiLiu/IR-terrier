	<brief_title>Freeze-Dried Black Raspberries Treating Patients With Oral Squamous Cell Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship length short-term lyophilized black raspberry ( LBR ) administration human oral cancer patient modulation , oral cavity tissue , subset specific gene previously identify u `` LBR-responsive '' associate LBR 's chemopreventive activity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect LBR administration human cell proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis oral cavity tissue use various establish biomarkers include Ki-67 proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , caspase-3 , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . II . To assess feasibility administer lyophilize freeze-dried black raspberry oral troche form pre-surgical patient diagnose squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity ( compliance , tolerance , adverse event ) .</detailed_description>
