	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose linsitinib give together erlotinib hydrochloride radiation therapy surgery treat patient advanced recurrent head neck cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride linsitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy together erlotinib hydrochloride linsitinib may kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Postoperative Adjuvant Chemoradiation Advanced-Stage Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ( cSCCHN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine MTD ( maximally tolerate dose ) OSI-906 ( linsitinib ) use combination erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) radiation therapy surgery advanced-stage cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( cSCCHN ) . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate 2-year overall survival ( OS ) compare historical control . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability OSI-906 combination erlotinib radiation therapy surgery advanced-stage cSCCHN . II . To estimate 2-year disease specific disease free survival . III . To determine time recurrence pattern failure . IV . To evaluate effect short-term preoperative treatment erlotinib OSI-906 expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) parallel downstream molecular target cSCCHN one third patient . OUTLINE : Optional non-therapeutic ( biomarker ) portion : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm A : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) linsitinib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 1-14 . Arm B : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD placebo PO QD BID day 1-7 1-14 . Arm C : Patients receive linsitinib PO BID placebo PO QD BID day 1-7 1-14 . Treatment continue 1 day plan surgical resection ( 28 day surgery delay ) . Therapeutic portion : This phase I dose-escalation study linsitinib follow phase II study . Patients undergo standard QD conventional radiotherapy discretion treat physician . Patients receive concurrent linsitinib PO BID erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD entire course radiation absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 12 week , every 12-16 week 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
