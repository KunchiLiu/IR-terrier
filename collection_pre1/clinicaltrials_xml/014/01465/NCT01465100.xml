	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether partial irradiation liver liver cell transplantation reduce need dietary medical management could possibly eliminate need special diet medication treat disease patient phenylketonuria ( PKU ) normalize phenylalanine level body . Phenylalanine ( Phe ) substance need body obtain food people eat . People PKU get rid Phe body . Large amount Phe cause problem , deterioration mental function . At present time , liver cell transplant experimental do limited number human subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Cell Transplant Phenylketonuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human phenylketonuria ( PKU ) result phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) deficiency , represent one common extensively studied single-gene Mendelian disorder human . Unfortunately , optimum clinical outcome demand lifelong dietary restriction adherence unpalatable expensive artificial diet . Challenges maintain traditional therapy lead increase phenylalanine ( Phe ) level patient approach adulthood incumbent severe burden psychosocial intellectual difficulty . The recent introduction new medication Sapropterin treatment PKU improve Phe control dietary tolerance patient , enormous cost patient insurer FDA designate orphan product . Thus , unmet need novel therapy correct PKU . PAH almost exclusively express liver human . The main objective current proposal determine feasibility hepatocyte transplantation correct biochemical ( ultimately , clinical ) feature PKU .</detailed_description>
