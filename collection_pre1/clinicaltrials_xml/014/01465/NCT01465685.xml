	<brief_summary>This study compare interactive emotional/subjective effect single dos 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) methylphenidate , dopamine ( DA ) norepinephrine ( NE ) transporter blocker , healthy subject . The primary goal determine role transporter mediate DA NE release subjective response MDMA human . The investigator hypothesize methylphenidate attenuate subjective response MDMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emotional Effects Methylphenidate MDMA Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) widely use young people euphoric effect . MDMA release serotonin ( 5-HT ) , dopamine ( DA ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) . 5-HT release mainly contribute subjective effect MDMA whereas NE release involve cardiovascular psychostimulant effect MDMA . DA also likely involved reward reinforce effect drug abuse . However , functional role DA subjective effect MDMA human largely unclear . To determine role DA transporter ( DAT ) response MDMA humans investigator test effect DA NE transporter blocker methylphenidate subjective effect MDMA . The investigator use randomize double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design four experimental session . methylphenidate placebo administer MDMA placebo 16 healthy volunteer . Subjective cardiovascular response repeatedly assess throughout experiment plasma sample collect pharmacokinetics . The primary hypothesis methylphenidate significantly reduce subjective effect MDMA .</detailed_description>
