	<brief_summary>Uncontrolled high blood pressure ( HBP ) major public health concern lead cause cardiovascular disease worldwide . The HBP crisis particularly onerous African Americans disproportionately susceptible HBP non-Hispanic White Americans . Poor adherence prescribe medication regimen major problem , half patient diagnosed hypertension adhere prescribe medication . Mobile phone text message become widely integrate routine daily life may offer simple non-labor intensive strategy improve quality medication management enhance medication adherence . This propose research conduct two distinct phase address three specific aim . For Specific Aim 1 ( Phase I ) , investigator propose conduct focus group participant investigator target population order obtain feedback guide development mobile phone text message system seek improve adherence antihypertensive medication . For Specific Aim 2 ( Phase II ) , investigator propose pilot test newly develop text message intervention randomize controlled trial . For Specific Aim 3 ( Phase II ) , investigator propose ascertain participant perception intervention effectiveness satisfaction order guide system refinement . In Phase I , African Americans uncontrolled hypertension ( n=24-32 ) recruit take part one four focus group help guide development text message intervention . In Phase II , African Americans uncontrolled hypertension randomize receive usual care ( n=30 ) vs. text message intervention ( n=30 ) . The primary outcome pilot change medication adherence one month follow-up ; secondary outcome include change medication self-efficacy systolic diastolic blood pressure one month follow-up , well participant satisfaction text message intervention . The propose research utilize Wayne State University ( WSU ) Center Urban Studies conduct high quality professionally run focus group , WSU Division Computing Information Technology 's Broadcast Message Service infrastructure delivery text message , WSU Center Health Research statistical analysis grant management assistance , diverse study team variety disciplinary background WSU . As result , propose research leverage considerable local resource investigate innovative much need intervention high-risk population .</brief_summary>
