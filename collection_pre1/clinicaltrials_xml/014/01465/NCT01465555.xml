	<brief_summary>The specific aim project conduct three-phase study develop data-driven Clinical Alert feature RecoveryTrackâ„¢ Concurrent Recovery Monitoring ( CRM ) system test efficacy , follow : Phase I - Analyze RecoveryTrack outcomes data create clinical algorithm predict early treatment attrition ; adapt element cognitive behavioral intervention ( CBI ) use address Clinical Alerts , well adapt train adherence measure ; reprogram RecoveryTrack Clinical Alert feature first three monitor assessment inform counselor client High Risk leave treatment . Phase II -Conduct feasibility trial refine Clinical Alerts + CBI intervention study measures/procedures . Phase III - Conduct pilot randomize clinical trial compare outcomes client whose counselor randomize Clinical Alerts + CBI client whose counselor assign TAU ( control condition ) . The primary hypothesis client evidence High Risk attrition longer lengths stay Clinical Alerts + CBI condition High Risk client control condition . Secondary client hypothesis High Risk client Clinical Alert + CBI condition attend treatment session , drug-free urine result , receive ancillary service High Risk client control condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1 : Our study team complete Phase I project June , 2011 . Our initial plan call team analyze RT data collect Delaware treatment program determine specific predictor early attrition treatment . Eleven counselor train use RT part standard practice May , 2011 . In effort generate predictive algorithm Phase II , analyze data three datasets available IRB approve research project . However , result inconclusive , possibly due small sample size difference recruitment definition drop across sample . In order proceed Phase II , create algorithm base largely severity substance use , consistent predictor drop-out across alcohol illicit substance literature ; algorithm also address client use Risk factor greatly outweigh influence Protective factor . We determine algorithm work identify client self-reported use substance high level risk . However , identification rate high-risk case low , modified algorithm identify : 1 ) client high use baseline , 2 ) client positive urine sample , 3 ) client use subsequent [ post-baseline ] interview , 4 ) client whose risk factor outweigh protective factor . This increased rate identification risk case 32 % . As part Phase I , also complete programming change RT add Clinical Alert feature inform counselor client high risk base algorithm . The CBI intervention training material Phase II create . We develop CBI brief clinical `` toolkit '' enable counselor respond clinical risk base judgment . This Toolkit allow counselor exercise clinical judgment determine whether client generate Clinical Alert 1 ) use drug alcohol , risk start use , 2 ) unmet psychosocial need [ i.e. , need psychiatric consultation ] , 3 ) poor alliance counselor / treatment provider need help building relationship . The Clinical Alert Toolkit include series exercise / intervention counselor could deploy determined client 's need press ( either base judgment agreement client ) . Phase 2 : Three counselor consent participate study train use RT May , 2011 train CBI intervention June , 2011 . Recruitment client participant begin July , 2011 . The training intervention material well receive participate counselor . One counselor end employment prior research staff begin client recruitment . 30 client 35 approach participate feasibility trial ; 28 client complete baseline ( 93 % ) , 23 complete one month follow ( 77 % ) , 21 complete two month follow ( 70 % ) , 21 complete three month follow ( 70 % ) . Out client , two client incarcerate 1 month follow window , 2 client incarcerate 2 month follow window , three client incarcerate three month follow window therefore approach complete follow-up interview . We use experience Phase II make several change train clinical protocol counselor follow . We revise several Toolkit component ( specifically worksheet make user-friendly reduce train burden ) . We also simplify feedback strategy take place clinical supervision session focus much less general therapeutic skill specifically actual compliance train Clinical Alert CBI . Additionally , find Phase II training counselor verbalize motivation try learn use CBI technique , learn curve slow desire , decide employ contingency management feedback strategy increase incentive acquire basic element CBI quickly . This revision require IRB approval ; revise approach , counselor could earn bonus rat audio record session show least minimally adherent deliver CBI . Finally , Phase II complete Attention Control training ( focused treatment planning ) use TAU condition . Phase 3 : Because need move study Delaware Site 1 ( original clinical site partner ) , team recruit Alternate Site 1 Philadelphia Alternate Site 2 central New Jersey conduct Phase III clinical pilot trial . We enrol 20 counselor train use RT monthly basis client , start first schedule individual session monthly thereafter . We randomly assign counselor receive either TAU treatment plan train receive Clinical Alert ( CA ) training . After training , recruitment begin . During trial , three counselor CA condition either noncompliant study protocol ( N = 2 ) , never client report high risk ( N = 1 ) . We work three counselor encourage improve engagement intervention study procedure , successful . Consequently , decide would over-recruit additional counselor CA condition , create additional opportunity determine whether Clinical Alerts + Intervention training would impact outcomes . We recruit additional three counselor , randomize ; rather , assign directly CA condition . We enrol 336 client Phase 3 . 142 self-reported clinical RT data would result Clinical Alert profile ( TAU : N = 78 , CA : N = 64 ) . Because low recruitment rate , study severely underpowered subanalyses examine specific effect intervention train deal High Risk case ; believe strong effect would present .</detailed_description>
