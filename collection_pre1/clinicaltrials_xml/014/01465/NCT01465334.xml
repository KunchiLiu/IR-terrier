	<brief_summary>The main purpose study examine two separate group 17p deletion Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) participant respond sequential treatment particular combination drug . The two group participant previously receive treatment CLL yet receive treatment . The combination drug Ofatumumab High-Dose Methylprednisolone ( HDMP ) first follow Ofatumumab Alemtuzumab . All three drug FDA approve know activity treat 17p CLL . We hope combine drug together study , benefit one alone subject ' CLL significantly impact .</brief_summary>
