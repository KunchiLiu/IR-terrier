	<brief_summary>This open label , human pilot study optimise control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) administer Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite ( PfSPZ . Volunteers inoculate PfSPZ Challenge . The route administration dose vary order identify optimal regimen achieve great infection rate volunteer Plasmodium falciparum . All volunteer recruit healthy adult age 18 45 year .

	<brief_title>Optimisation Controlled Human Malaria Infection Using Sporozoites Administered Needle Syringe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies involve CHMI powerful tool investigate malaria vaccine prophylactic drug efficacy.CHMI become established key tool ass efficacy novel malaria vaccine drug . As CHMI trial carry controlled environment , allow unprecedented detailed evaluation parasite growth immunological response , provide essential information vaccine drug development . Out three currently available method perform experimental human malaria infection ( blood stage infection , mosquito bite sporozoite infection ) , experimental injection directly needle syringe use aseptic , purified , cryopreserved sporozoite , principle , accurate practical way dose sporozoite challenge study . Recently , Sanaria Inc able overcome technical issue associate production aseptic , purify , cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite . As result , Investigational New Drug application ( IND ) submit U.S. Food Drug Administration February 2009 , Phase 1 clinical trial experimental challenge volunteer initiate April 2009 . Another trial sponsor Sanaria find dose aseptic , purified , cryopreserved sporozoite use experimental human malaria infection currently ongoing collaboration Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center , The Netherlands . This trial first time aseptic , purified , cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoite administer intramuscularly human .</detailed_description>
