	<criteria>Male female confirm diagnosis cystic fibrosis define : Clinical feature consistent diagnosis CF [ ( Rosenstein BJ Cutting GR 1998 ) ] ; AND Sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L pilocarpine iontophoresis ; OR Genotypic confirmation CFTR mutation Aged 18 year old Ability provide sample microbiological evaluation throughout study . Note : sputum sample prefer however cough swab may perform occasion sputum collect . Positive microbiological finding Pseudomonas aeruginosa expectorate sputum cough swab document within 24 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . FEV1 must , Screening ( Visit 1 ) , 35 % 80 % predict normal value follow adjustment age , gender , height accord Knudson equation [ ( Knudson RJ. , Lebowitz MD. , et al 1983 ) ] . At Screening ( Visit 1 ) , clinical laboratory finding suggestive significant pulmonary illness , CF , opinion investigator would preclude participation study . Female subject child bear potential male subject participate study sexually active must use acceptable contraception . Female subject document non childbearing potential ( Section 4.2.8 ) exempt contraceptive requirement . For purpose study acceptable contraception define : oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; OR placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; OR barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Provision write informed consent Changes underlie therapy ( e.g. , pulmonary massage therapy , bronchodilator , NSAIDs , antibiotic agent , pancreatic enzyme preparation , nutritional supplement DNase within 21 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . Subjects must willing remain underlying stable therapy regimens duration study final followup visit Day 111 . Changes physiotherapy technique schedule within 14 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . Prohibited medication within 7 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . Prohibited medication describe Section 5.6 Pulmonary exacerbation within 28 day Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Positive microbiological finding Burkholderia sp . expectorate sputum cough swab document within 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Ongoing acute illness . Subjects must need outpatient visit , hospitalization require change therapy pulmonary disease Screening ( Visit 1 ) Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . History , plan organ transplantation . Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA ) last 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) , define receive treatment ABPA . Requirement continuous ( 24 hour/day ) oxygen supplementation . Concomitant administration inhale mannitol hypertonic saline within 7 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . Initiation cycle , inhale tobramycin ( TOBI ) less 4 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Note : Chronic TOBI user allow participate study , subject recently initiate chronic TOBI least 2 cycle TOBI precede 4 month enrol study . Chronic TOBI subject start 'off TOBI ' period Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) concomitant dose TOBI assign study medication . Clinically significant abnormal finding haematology clinical chemistry . In addition , value ≥ 3 x upper limit normal exclude subject participate study . Subjects unable perform pulmonary function test accord ATS/ERS criterion . Pregnant breastfeed woman . A negative urine pregnancy test must demonstrate female childbearing potential ( Section 4.2.8 ) Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Subjects participate interventional clinical trial within 28 day prior Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) . Subjects document suspected , clinically significant , alcohol drug abuse . The determination clinical significance determine Investigator . Known allergy intolerance alginates ( e.g. , food food additive base seaweed extract ) . Current malignant disease ( exception basal cell carcinoma ; BCC ) . Any serious active medical psychiatric illness , opinion Investigator , would interfere subject treatment , assessment , compliance protocol .</criteria>
