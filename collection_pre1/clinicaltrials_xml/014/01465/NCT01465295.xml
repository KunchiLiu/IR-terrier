	<brief_title>Evaluate Initial Safety HemiBridge™ System Guided Spinal Growth Treatment Progressive Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance Spinal deformity fusion treatment involve costly invasive procedure orthopaedics . The development effective treatment method avoid fusion need . Many pediatric spine specialist concur growth modulation display compel pre-clinical clinical data must study . While brace non-operative modality evidence effectiveness idiopathic scoliosis , level effectiveness compare observation natural history remain inconclusive . Research publish 50 year , yet conflict literature report successes failure . Most literature consist retrospective report brace experience , little commonality relative exist condition time bracing initiate , documentation compliance basis judge success . The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) independent panel private-sector expert primary care prevention . The Task Force convene U.S. Public Health Service systematically review evidence effectiveness clinical preventive service . One charge evaluate evidence support practice school screen adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . After systematically review literature date , policy statement issue 1992 , updated 1996 state `` …There inadequate evidence determine whether brace therapy limit natural progression disease significant proportion case , study suffer selection bias , lack internal control group , inadequate follow-up , small sample size , lack health outcome measure . '' There Level One evidence support practice bracing , clinician leave conflict questionable inference regard brace effectiveness . Some clinician believe evidence favor decrease rate curve progression , base assumption , half state U.S. mandate school screening program detection early treatment scoliosis . On hand , group USPSTF , British Canadian counterparts many individual practitioner worldwide feel evidence inconclusive therefore ambivalent brace treatment . Due variability publish result brace effectiveness , researcher United States Canada commence randomize multi-center trial brace versus brace determine effectiveness brace wear treatment idiopathic scoliosis ( BRAIST Study ) . This study , initiated 2007 United States , perform auspex US National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Canadian Institute Health . In Netherlands , randomize multi-center study compare brace observation also underway . While brace treatment non-invasive preserve growth , motion function spine , correct deformity . In addition , brace pressure rib cage influence chest wall grow child create concern . Some scoliosis patient wear brace long five year learn brace treatment fail recommended endure major fusion surgery recovery . When surgery ( fusion instrumentation ) require scoliosis , internal fixation spine achieve correction bony fusion perform . Surgical correction via posterior fusion typically perform curve great 40 - 50° , often accompany discectomy release anterior longitudinal ligament curve great 75° . Smaller incision use portal anterior surgery become available early 1990 's video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) . Potential advantage include less muscular chest wall disruption , less impact pulmonary function , quick recovery time small scar . Arlet ( 2000 ) complete meta-analysis 10 article total 151 patient , VATS utilize scoliosis surgery . Of 151 patient , 18 % ( 27 complication ) experience major minor complication , include major bleeding ( 3 ) , prolong ventilation ( 10 ) , pulmonary complication ( 6 ) , intercostal neuralgia ( number specify ) , aborted procedure ( 3 ) , one chylothorax , infection , tachycardia . A conclusion could draw whether complication rate increase decrease VATS . The correction rate similar open thoracotomy . Scoliosis fusion surgery involve extensive posterior and/or anterior spine exposure associate risk , frequent blood transfusion ( 2 4 unit ) , high postoperative pain , loss motion treat segment , slow rehabilitation . The child also potential life-long complication present several year surgery , include adjacent segment disease degeneration many case require additional surgery . Andersen conduct study 100 brace 115 surgical patient idiopathic scoliosis 10 year treatment complete . The SF-36 score ( patient physical mental health assessment ) differ two group ; however , group 's score low age-matched normal control . Results brace patient indicate 17 % felt brace unpleasant would rather take chance curve progression wear brace . Of braced patient , 71 % indicate would prefer operation ( fusion ) brace . More two three patient n't wear brace prescribe due skin irritation . Other investigator refute impact brace quality life . Thus , neither brace surgical fusion treatment represent ideal treatment idiopathic scoliosis . As , need idiopathic scoliosis treatment address population patient whose curvature unlikely correct via brace risk less invasive non-fusion surgical treatment may exceed potential benefit avoid lifelong progression extensive fusion surgery . The HemiBridge™ System indicate progressive idiopathic scoliosis ( Lenke Type 1A 1B ) skeletally immature ( Risser Grade 0 triradiate cartilage open ) patient mechanically modulate spinal growth ( hemiepiphysiodesis ) arrest spinal deformity progression without need spinal fusion . The HemiBridge™ System intend place contiguous level anterior thoracoscopic procedure convex side main thoracic curve measure 25° 40° , end vertebra curve span level inclusive T3 L1 . The HemiBridge™ System intend male female chronologic age 10 year old . Females Atlas Matching bone age ≥ 8 year 10 month exceed 13 year ( pre-menarche ) males Atlas Matching bone age ≥ 10 year exceed 15 year . Innovation The study device , name HemiBridgeTM System , result extensive pre-clinical research development initiate Donita Bylski-Austrow , PhD Eric Wall , MD Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center University Cincinnati . Research development study device date use interdisciplinary team , include pediatric spine surgeon , engineer , scientist regulatory expert . This team help define compressive loading require alter growth , test prototype device preclinical model , improve test article clinical use , confirm repeatable in-vivo result compliance FDA Good Laboratory Practices . This process lead approval study device achieve FDA IRB approval begin clinical phase test . The HemiBridge System 's innovation ability apply mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis redirect spine growth develop accommodate adolescent physiologic load remain securely fasten spinal motion segment . Additionally , System include innovative patient safety surgeon interface feature . The surgical technique instrumentation co-developed SpineForm LLC Orthopaedics Department Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center . The application mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis treat progressive scoliosis challenge use external bracing and/or observation ( watchful wait ) . Comparing pooled rate two non-operative intervention show clear advantage either approach ; therefore , one recommend one non-operative approach prevent need surgery adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . Arresting curve progression HemiBridge System avoid fusion may significantly impact quality life reduce total lifetime patient care cost . Providing patient surgical alternative superior current non-operative standard care paradigm shift must study determine safety indication use . The clinical study protocol design limit patient high risk progress need multi-level fusion surgery . There medical device clear FDA treat late juvenile early adolescent onset idiopathic scoliosis . The HemiBridge System first mechanical compression device FDA approve pediatric investigational use . The propose study first use human HemiBridge System . The clinical trial enable study sponsor gather prospective information continuously improve product , indication , next study phase clinical protocol design recommend surgical technique .</detailed_description>
