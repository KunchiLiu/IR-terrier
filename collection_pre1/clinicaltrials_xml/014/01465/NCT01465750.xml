According statistic Department Health , incidence ovarian cancer increase recent year mortality rate high gynecologic malignancy Taiwan . Ovarian cancer become important disease gradually field gynecologic malignancy . The classification histology ovarian cancer include epithelial ovarian cancer、germ cell tumors、sex-cord cell tumors…etc . Epithelial ovarian carcinoma common ovarian cancer clinically . Early diagnosis difficult due lack obvious initial symptom , ovarian cancer patient usually advanced stage diagnosis confirm . The prognostic parameter ovarian carcinoma include tumor stage , histological subtype , degree malignancy , residual tumor surgical intervention response chemotherapy . However , possible etiology mechanism ovarian cancer still unclear . However , epidemiologic data ovarian cancer Taiwan .

	<brief_title>Epidemiology Ovarian Cancer Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population : To evaluate epidemiology prognosis ovarian cancer Taiwan , conduct nationwide analysis link national cancer registry database . Every citizen Taiwan life-long identification number link individual information , include health status . The Taiwan household registry database provide Department Health source population . National household registry death certificate adopt ascertain live status study subject , provide individual demographic characteristics.All individual linkages database conduct accord study protocol , i.e . database link correspond identification number , name ( Chinese character ) birthday , data include study analyze without individual identification information . The agreement utilize database study obtain Bureau Health Promotion Taiwan . Incident death case ascertainment : Patients ovarian cancer , include epithelial ovarian carcinoma , germ cell tumor , sex cord tumor … etc. , identify computerized linkage Taiwan national cancer registry International Classification Diseases Oncology Third Edition T-code C569 . Histological type identify morphology code cancer registry database . Women affect ovarian cancer find death due ovarian cancer ( International Classification Diseases 9th edition code 183 ) death certificate define death case . Statistical Analyses : The number person-years risk develop die ovarian cancer calculate . Incidence rate calculate divide number ovarian cancer case person-years risk develop ovarian cancer . Mortality rate calculate divide number ovarian cancer death person-years risk die ovarian cancer . The association mortality age , histology , time period estimate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis Cox 's proportional hazard model . It define significantly different statistically p value less 0.05 .</detailed_description>
