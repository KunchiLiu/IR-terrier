	<brief_summary>Hypothesis Response guide therapy improve significantly overall SVR Hispanics compare historical control . There difference SVR patient undetectable HCV RNA week 8 week 28 receive 4 week lead-in PR plus 24 week PR+BOC base treatment patient detectable HCV RNA week 8 undetectable HCV RNA week 24 receive lead-in PR plus 32 week PR+BOC follow base therapy 12 week PR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Hispanic Patients Diagnosed With Hepatitis C Using Boceprevir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND ENROLLMENT Open label single arm pilot study enrol Hispanic patient HCV genotype 1 naive pegylated interferon BOC treatment . Definition BOC RGT : All patient receive 4 week PR ( lead-in ) , BOC add begin week 5 . Patients undetectable HCV RNA week 8 week 24 receive 24 week PR BOC ( 28 week total treatment ) ; patient detectable HCV RNA week 8 , undetectable HCV RNA week 24 , receive additional 32 week PR BOC , follow 12 week PR ( 48 week total treatment ) . Patients cirrhosis bridge fibrosis ( Stage 4 fibrosis ) receive 4 week lead follow 44 week BOC PR ( total 48 week ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible trial , patient must documentation follow : Male female &gt; 18 year old HCV genotype1 infection Liver biopsy consistent Chronic Hepatitis C ( CHC ) within last 3 year No previous treatment antiHCV therapy ( approved investigational ) For woman childbearing potential , negative urine pregnancy test result document within 24 hour prior first dose study drug ( BOC , PEGINF alfa2b , ribavirin ) . Additionally , female patient childbearing potential male female partner childbearing potential must use two form effective contraception ( combine ) study treatment 6 month treatment . Willingness give write informed consent participate comply requirement study Patients follow eligible participation : Infection HCV genotype 1 History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease CHC ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , metabolic liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure ) History evidence decompensated liver disease ( e.g. , coagulopathy , hyperbilirubinemia , hepatic encephalopathy , hypoalbuminemia , ascites , bleed esophageal varix ) ChildPugh score &gt; 6 ( see Appendix 1 ) Infection hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , HIV demonstrate positive test screen antiHAV immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody ( Ab ) , hepatitis B surface antigen , antihepatitis B core protein IgM Ab , antiHIV antibody History receive IFN , PEGIFN , ribavirin , viramidine , levovirin , investigational HCV protease polymerase inhibitor previous time , systemic antiviral therapy establish perceived activity HCV within 3 month prior enrollment . Pregnant breastfeed Male partner female pregnant breastfeed Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 12 g/dL female &lt; 13 g/dL male patient increase risk anemia ( e.g. , thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , spherocytosis , history gastrointestinal bleeding ) anemia would medically problematic Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1000 cells/mm3 Platelet count &lt; 70,000 cells/mm3 Receipt stimulate factor granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( GCSF ) , erythropoietin , therapeutic agent elevate hematology parameter facilitate patient entry study Serum creatinine concentration &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) History severe psychiatric disease , include psychosis and/or depression , characterize suicide attempt , hospitalization psychiatric disease , period disability result psychiatric disease Poorly control thyroid dysfunction History cardiac disease ( e.g. , New York Heart Association functional class II , III , IV , myocardial infarction within last 6 month , ventricular tachyarrhythmias require ongoing treatment , unstable angina , significant cardiovascular disease . In addition , patient document presumed coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease enrol , judgment investigator , acute decrease hemoglobin 4 g/dL ( may see ribavirin therapy ) would well tolerate . History uncontrolled severe seizure disorder within last year Patients treat previously protease polymerase inhibitor Coadministration drug highly dependent CYP3A4/5 clearance , elevate plasma concentration associate serious and/or lifethreatening event include Appendix 2 . Coadministration potent CYP3A4/5 inducer , significantly reduce boceprevir plasma concentration may associate reduced efficacy .</criteria>
