	<detailed_description>Introduction Collagen IV-related nephropathy , cause mutation three gene encode collagen type IV basal membrane , represent spectrum phenotypes Alport syndrome ( AS ) thin basement membrane nephropathy ( TBMN ) ( 1 ) . Subtypes X-linked AS ( XLAS ) correspond approximately 80 % AS , autosomal recessive AS ( ARAS ) , count 15 % AS , autosomal dominant form , represent autosomal dominant AS ( ADAS , 5 % AS ) TBMN , believe present 1 % population ( 1 ) . Besides renal manifestation , disease present cochlear ocular abnormality ( 2 ) . However , hallmark Collagen IV-related nephropathy hematuria . Proteinuria detect life , marker disease progression . All male XLAS develop proteinuria , eventually , progressive renal insufficiency , lead end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Overall , estimate 60 % reach ESRD age 30 year , 90 % age 40 year ( 2 ) . Approximately 12 % female XLAS develop ESRD age 40 year , increase 30 % age 60 year ( 3 ) . Most individual ARAS develop significant proteinuria late childhood adolescence ESRD age 30 year . Progression ESRD slow individual ADAS . Similarly , TBMN characterize clinically persistent microhematuria often observe childhood . TBMN rarely associate extrarenal abnormality proteinuria . Hypertension progression ESRD unusual ( 4 ) . Despite severity disease , high rate ESRD , increase knowledge genetics diagnosis , currently prove treatment AS . So far , therapeutic approach limit angiotensin-II ( AII ) blockade , blood pressure control diet counseling . Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) usually start proteinuria appear clear evidence treatment alters natural history disease human . Our goal describe evolution series case Collagen IV-related nephropathy proteinuria treat enalapril , well predictive variable progression ESRD . Patients Methods This retrospective study collagen IV-related nephropathy patient follow Instituto da Criança - HCFMUSP 1999 2010 . All patient present glomerular hematuria ( erythrocyte dysmorphism and/or red blood cell cast urinary sediment ) proteinuria . In 16 19 case diagnosis base familial history renal histology finding show negative immunofluorescence ultrastructural abnormality glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) show TBMN ( uniform diffuse attenuation GBM without typical lamellation thicken see AS ) AS ( defect term alternate attenuation , splitting , lamellation , thicken along GBM ) . However , difficult discriminate initial stage AS TBMN . Three patient submit renal biopsy since familial history renal histology relatives characteristic disease . Only adherent patient include , base presence attendance exam . The patient visit outpatient clinic least every 3 month least 2 year follow . The following parameter evaluate baseline : age , renal function ( serum creatinine , urea , creatinine clearance accord Schwartz Formula ) ( 5 ) , 24 hour proteinuria , blood pressure light electron microscopy renal fragment . In patient , enalapril employ RAAS blocker , observe benefit side effect hypotension symptom and/or sign . Our protocol intend reach dose 0.3 mg/kg/day . The following parameter also collect follow : serum creatinine urea , 24 hour proteinuria creatinine clearance estimate stature ( Schwartz Formula ) . In study hyperfiltration define ≥ 145 ml/minute/1.73m2BS , base Piepsz et al Prestidge et al data ( 6,7 ) . Statistical analysis Mann-Whitney chi-square ( Fisher ) test use univariate analysis . For analysis effect enalapril proteinuria first 2 year treatment use non-parametric repeated measure analysis ( Friedmann´s test ) . We analyze main predictive variable CKD progression , consider creatinine clearance 60 ml/min/1.73m2 outcome .</detailed_description>
