	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose temozolomide pazopanib hydrochloride give together see well work treat patient advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNET ) remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need tumor growth . Giving temozolomide together pazopanib hydrochloride may effective treatment patient PNET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) temozolomide pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) combination patient advanced PNET . ( Phase I ) II . Determine overall response rate ( ORR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity profile combination temozolomide pazopanib population . ( Phase I ) II . Describe pharmacokinetics temozolomide alone combination pazopanib . ( Phase I ) III . Observe ORR . ( Phase I ) IV . Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , duration response ( DOR ) . ( Phase II ) V. Determine safety toxicity profile combination large cohort patient . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine relationship tumor blood flow , measure perfusion functional compute tomography ( f CT ) , overall response . II . Correlate expression tissue methyl-guanine methyl transferase ( MGMT ) measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ORR PFS . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 15-21 pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
