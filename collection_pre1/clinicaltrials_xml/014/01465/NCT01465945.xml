	<brief_summary>Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery ( TEM ) minimally invasive technique use remove rectal tumour . After tumour remove rectum , surgeon choice close defect leave defect open naturally close . Currently , option accept standard care . Leaving defect open close naturally possible advantage , include shorten operation time similar rate postoperative complication . However , concern surgically close defect may lead postoperative pain delay recovery . The study double blind randomize control trial determine whether patient rectal wall defect suture close less post-operative pain compare patient whose defect leave open .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Unsutured Versus Sutured Closure Rectal Defects After Rectal Lesion Excisions Using Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary Background Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery ( TEM ) advance minimally invasive endoluminal technique use remove rectal tumour . In open transanal excision era , evidence outcome unsutured rectal defect similar patient whose defect close . However , evidence approach minimal technical difference TEM ( e.g . rectal insufflation ) may mean leave defect unsutured safe approach . Further , anecdotal evidence unsutured defect lead postoperative pain delay recovery . Objective The purpose study determine postoperative pain ( primary ) early postoperative complication ( secondary ) bad patient undergo TEM defect close compare similar patient endoluminal suture closure defect . Methods This multicentre , double blind randomize control trial suture closure versus closure patient treat TEM rectal lesion . The study include patient 18 year old rectal lesion within 12cm anal verge treat TEM . The primary outcome postoperative pain measure validated visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Secondary outcome include analgesic use early ( &lt; 30 day ) complication . Based anticipated VAS score , sample size 38 patient enrol ( power 0.80 , Î±=0.05 ) . Statistical analysis perform use student 's T test continuous data Fischer 's exact test dichotomous variable . Impact Currently , 3 centre Canada experience TEM : Vancouver , Winnipeg Ottawa . This study represent first trial Canadian TEM Collaborative determine advantage suture closure rectal defect TEM surgery . This important , suture technique challenge important advantage approach , would mandate perfect suture technique employ TEM approach rectal tumour . Conversely , advantage leave defect unsutured , may reduce operative time facilitate well use OR time . Further , inform TEM surgeon best approach rectal defect optimize patient care . Finally , study serve start point trial Canadian TEM Collaborative expand include new site become world leader TEM clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must 18 year old rectal lesion &lt; 12cm anal verge ( measure rigid sigmoidoscopy ) less half circumference rectal lumen . The patient must provide informed consent TEM inclusion trial . The surgeon decide convert laparotomy conventional TAE reason tumor excision . The surgeon judge rectal defect appropriate suturing ( e.g . large ) leave unsutured ( e.g . entry peritoneal cavity ) The patient currently treat chronic pain prior surgery , know bleed diathesis ( e.g . warfarin treatment , hemophilia , etc ) immunosuppressed ( e.g . Prednisone , HIV , etc )</criteria>
