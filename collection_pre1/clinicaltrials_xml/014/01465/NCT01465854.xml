	<detailed_description>According WHO , 25 % lung cancer worldwide occur lifelong never smoker . Lung cancer never smoker ( LCINS ) show many clinical , epidemiological , molecular genomic difference compare tobacco-related neoplasm . So , consider separate entity . LCINS particularly occur woman Asian . They mainly adenocarcinoma . Known risk factor occupational exposure , environmental tobacco smoking , familial history cancer , personal medical history lung disease environmental cause . LCINS carry frequently molecular abnormality lead efficacy target therapy ( EGFR mutation , EML4-ALK inversion , less frequent mutation KRAS ... ) . However , data come retrospective study , subgroup analysis and/or Asian cohort even though disease significant geographic variability . Finally , study focus correlation risk factor molecular genomic abnormality . For reason consider LCINS increase public health problem , IFCT ( Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie Thoracique ) state promote BioCAST study ( IFCT-1002 ) . It national , multicentric , prospective epidemiological study . Main objective describe clinical molecular epidemiology LCINS French population compose case newly diagnose participate centre ( 500 1500 patient expect ) . BioCAST include clinical biological part . The clinical component base collect data directly patient standardized questionnaire telephone interview health professional . The biologic component include blood sample collection . A large genomic wide association study epigenetic study ( include micro RNA study ) also plan . Other objective look correlation clinical factor molecular abnormality ; look new oncogene specific population . BioCAST hop provide concrete answer clinician patient new frequent entity .</detailed_description>
