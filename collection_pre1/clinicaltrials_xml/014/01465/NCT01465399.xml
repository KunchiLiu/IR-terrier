	<brief_summary>Immediately follow tooth removal , heal process begin affect eventual alveolar bone volume architecture alveolar ridge . Satisfactory timely heal essential obtain ideal functional reconstruction . Traumatic removal tooth , poor heal response , may lead excessive bone loss delay tooth replacement , require expensive time-consuming reconstructive surgery , even inability correct . The Plasma Rich Growth Factors ( PRGF-Endoret ) show therapeutic potential effect minimize consequence aggression , promote regeneration hard soft involve tissue .</brief_summary>
