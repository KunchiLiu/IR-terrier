	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess performance AclarusDx™ , investigational blood test detect gene expression information , intend help physician make Alzheimer 's Disease diagnosis patient memory impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance AclarusDx™ , Blood-Based Transcriptomic Test AD , US Patients Newly Referred Memory Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study apply AclarusDx™ signature reference US Center 160 patient newly refer one three study center within Cleveland Clinic , Center Brain Health network , diagnostic workup . Only AclarusDx™ add panel test usually perform center establish diagnosis . AclarusDx™ use investigational use , diagnostic purpose . The ultimate goal define clinical utility AclarusDx™ provide Primary Care Physicians ( PCPs ) tool help make diagnosis Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . The primary objective : 1 . To obtain estimate capability AclarusDx™ identify AD patient among US-based population newly refer patient suffer objective memory impairment maybe potentially related multiple different etiology . 2 .
