	<criteria>Provide write , informed consent prior trialrelated procedure include HIV testing ( HIV test perform within 1 month prior trial start , repeat long documentation provide [ ELISA and/or Western Blot ] ) . Body weight ( light clothing shoe ) 40 90 kg , inclusive . Sputum smearpositive pulmonary TB ( trial appoint laboratory ) . For Drug Sensitive TB treatment arm , subject newly diagnose previously untreated . Exception : Participants include trial diagnose treat TB great 5 year prior screen provide documentation cure episode . Additionally , participant previously receive H prophylactically include long treatment is/was discontinue least 7 day prior randomization trial . Drug sensitive status confirm fluoroquinolone , rifampicin isoniazid susceptibility test screen use Hain Plus rapid sputum test . For MDRTB treatment arm : Subjects smearpositive MDR infection , define confirm resistance least R H confirm screen entry trial . Resistance R H determine use rapid screen test ( Hain Plus ) . If first spot sputum show indeterminate result , test must repeat freshly collect spot sputum overnight sputum result may use . Subjects newly diagnose MDRTB define ) subject MDRTB never treat TB , b ) subject MDRTB previously treat one course firstline TB drug ( H , R , E , Z and/or S ) treatment is/was discontinue least 7 day prior randomization trial . Additionally , MDRTB participants previously receive H prophylactically include long treatment is/was discontinue least 7 day prior randomization trial . A chest Xray picture opinion Investigator compatible TB . Sputum positive ( site laboratory ) direct microscopy acidfast bacillus ( least 1+ IUATLD/WHO scale ) . Ability produce adequate volume sputum estimate spot assessment ( estimate 10 ml overnight production ) . Females may participate : 1 ) nonchildbearing potential ( bilateral oophorectomy , tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ) , 2 ) use effective birth control method willing continue practice birth control method throughout treatment 3 ) nonheterosexually active , practice sexual abstinence vasectomize partner ( confirm sterile ) . Therefore eligible study woman childbearing potential either : 1 ) use double barrier method prevent pregnancy ( i.e . use condom either diaphragm cervical cap ) 2 ) use hormonal base contraceptive combination barrier contraceptive , 3 ) use intrauterine device combination barrier contraceptive . They must also willing continue contraceptive measure one week last dose study medication one week discontinuation study medication case premature discontinuation . ( Note : Hormonebased contraception alone may reliable take IMP ; therefore , hormonebased contraceptive alone use female participant prevent pregnancy ) . Male participant heterosexual intercourse female childbearing potential require use one follow birth control method participation trial 12 week last dose study medication prevent pregnancy : double barrier method include male condom , diaphragm , cervical cap , female condom ; barrier method combine hormonebased contraceptive intrauterine device female partner . The use mention birth control method apply male participant vasectomise bilateral orchidectomy minimally three month prior screen , heterosexually active , practice sexual abstinence female sexual partner bilateral oophorectomy , tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month . Evidence clinically significant ( judged investigator ) , metabolic , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , musculoskeletal , ophthalmological , pulmonary , neurological , psychiatric endocrine disease , malignancy , abnormality ( indication study ) include myasthenia gravis malaria . End stage liver failure ( class Child Pugh C ) . Poor general condition delay treatment tolerate per discretion Investigator . Clinically significant evidence extrathoracic TB ( e.g . miliary TB , abdominal TB , urogenital TB , osteoarthritic TB , TB meningitis ) , judge Investigator . History allergy hypersensitivity study IMP relate substance , include know allergy fluoroquinolone antibiotic , history tendinopathy associate quinolones suspect hypersensitivity rifamycin antibiotic . Resistance fluoroquinolones ( Hain plus rapid test ) and/or pyrazinamide . Participants may include study prior receipt susceptibility test result fluoroquinolones pyrazinamide , however receive participant enter study result show participant resistant fluoroquinolones and/or pyrazinamide , participant remove trial . DS participant replace , MDRTB participant take part EBA SubStudy could replace consultation write approval sponsor . Known ( positive urine drug screen ) suspect , current history within past 2 year , alcohol drug abuse , , opinion Investigator , sufficient compromise safety cooperation participant . For HIV infect participant : CD4+ count &lt; 200 cells/µL ; receive intravenous antifungal medication within last 90 day ; AIDSdefining opportunistic infection malignancy ( except pulmonary TB ) . Having participated clinical study/ies investigational agent/s within 8 week prior trial start . Significant cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Participants follow screening ( per measurement read do Central ECG ) : Marked prolongation QT/QTc interval , e.g. , confirm demonstration QTcF ( Fridericia correction ) QTcB ( Bazett correction ) interval &gt; 450 m screening ; History additional risk factor Torsade de Pointes , e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history Long QT Syndrome ; Use concomitant medication know prolong QT/QTc interval ( see exclusion criterion 21 well list disallow medication study protocol ) ; Any clinically significant , opinion Investigator , ECG abnormality . Females pregnant , breastfeeding , plan conceive child within one week cessation treatment . Males plan conceive child within twelve week cessation treatment . History and/or presence ( evidence ) neuropathy epilepsy . Diabetes Mellitus require insulin . History lens opacity evidence lens opacity slit lamp ophthalmologic examination . Previously receive treatment PA824 part clinical trial . For DSTB treatment arm : treatment drug active MTB within 3 month prior Visit 1 ( e.g . isoniazid , ethambutol , amikacin , clofazimine , cycloserine , rifabutin , rifampicin , streptomycin , kanamycin , paraaminosalicylic acid , rifapentine , pyrazinamide , thioacetazone , capreomycin , fluoroquinolones , thioamides , metronidazole ) . Exceptions note Inclusion Criteria . For MDRTB Subjects : previously treat MDRTB . Defined receive multiple course firstline therapy secondline TB drug , include follow antimycobacterials : aminoglycoside except streptomycin , fluoroquinolone , thioamides , prothionamide ethionamide cycloserine . Any disease condition use standard TB drug component contraindicate , include limited allergy TB drug , component IMP . Any disease condition medicinal product list section protocol pertain prohibited medication use . Use drug within 30 day prior dose know prolong QTc interval ( include amiodarone , bepridil , chloroquine , chlorpromazine , cisapride , clarithromycin , disopyramide dofetilide , domperidone , droperidol , erythromycin , halofantrine , haloperidol , ibutilide , levomethadyl , mesoridazine , methadone , pentamidine , pimozide , procainamide , quinidine , sotalol , sparfloxacin , thioridazine ) . Exceptions may make participant receive 3 day less one drug substance , washout period administration IMP equivalent least 5 halflives drug substance . Use therapeutic agent know alter major organ function ( e.g. , barbiturate , opiate , phenothiazine , cimetidine ) within 30 day prior dose . The Investigator may choose his/her discretion make exception opiate painkiller part prescribe medication cough underlying disease . Use systemic glucocorticoid within one year prior dose . Participants follow toxicity screen define enhanced Division Microbiology Infectious Disease ( DMID ) adult toxicity table ( November 2007 ) : creatinine grade 2 great ( &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal [ ULN ] ) ; creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) level le 30 mls/min . accord CockcroftGault Formula ; hemoglobin grade 4 ( &lt; 6.5 g/dL ) ; platelet grade 2 great ( 50x109 cells/L ) ; serum potassium less low limit normal laboratory ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) grade 3 great ( ≥3.0 x ULN ) exclude ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) grade 3 great ( ≥3.0 x ULN ) exclude ; alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) grade 4 ( &gt; 8.0 x ULN ) exclude , grade 3 ( ≥3.0 8.0 x ULN ) must discuss sponsor Medical Monitor ; total bilirubin grade 3 great ( &gt; 2.0 x ULN , &gt; 1.50 x ULN accompany increase liver function test ) exclude , grade 2 ( &gt; 1.50 x ULN , &gt; 1.25 x ULN accompany increase liver function test ) must discuss sponsor Medical Monitor .</criteria>
