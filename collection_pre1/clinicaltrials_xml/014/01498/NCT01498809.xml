	<brief_summary>This project aim evaluate physiological effect Midodrine administration orthostatic challenge high level spinal cord injury . Midodrine show improve orthostatic symptom spinal cord injury physiological mechanism influence identify . The investiagtors examine key physiological component influence orthostatic tolerance . The investiagtors , measure baroreflex , brain blood flow autoregulation ( ability maintain brain blood flow ) sit-up test . Two sit-up test occur ; one Midodrine administration , one administration 10mg dose Midodrine .</brief_summary>
