	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate whether new technology call intrauterine photoacoustic endoscopy ( PAE ) use evaluate inner line uterus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photoacoustic Endoscopy Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate whether technology use also try obtain photoacoustic image functional data ( oxygen content , blood vessel characteristic , etc ) uterine line ass appearance woman without cancer endometrium . Currently , difficult physician know whether tumor endometrium invade spread organ without perform extend surgery call staging operation ( removal lymph node glands drain uterus ass microscope whether cancer spread ) . Our long term goal use new photoacoustic ( PA ) technology improve detection occult metastatic disease . Occult disease define tumor see without use image technique . possibly avoid need extend operation . All could result good care patient endometrial cancer gynecologic problem .</detailed_description>
