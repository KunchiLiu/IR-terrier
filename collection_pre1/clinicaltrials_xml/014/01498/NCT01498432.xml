	<brief_summary>This non-commercial study explore use Heliox21 new patient cohort . The fundamental aim ass therapeutic benefit Heliox21 practicality gas delivery patient require non-invasive ventilatory support follow extubation Intensive Care Unit . Thus , investigator aim extend knowledge potential role Heliox21 post-extubation environment Intensive Care Unit . The purpose study answer specific , clinically relevant question . That whether Heliox21 help reduce effort breathe period follow withdrawal mechanically assisted ventilation patient intensive care unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Response Heliox21 Air O2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failure wean mechanical ventilatory support occur magnitude respiratory system load exceeds capacity respond . Extubation success depend condition resolve improved . Gas exchange capacity , respiratory muscle strength , laryngeal function cough strength , nutritional status psychological state lead extubation failure . However , effort reduce work breathing might offer alternative strategy . Studies recently carry paediatric adult population disclose serious consequence fail extubation , namely prolong intensive care hospital stay , great mortality rate increase care cost . Gas flow airway either laminar turbulent . There need great pressure differential drive turbulent flow laminar one . Helium inert gas systemic biological effect ( standard temperature pressure ) . The low density viscosity Helium mean substitution nitrogen air allow laminar flow maintain much high flow rate , flow rate maintain much low work pressure ( 5 ) . As result , use helium-oxygen mixture ( Heliox21 ) potential reduce work breathing , also limit dynamic gas trapping increase cavity emptying , alter lung mechanics/ force expiratory pressure . As result , Heliox21 use respiratory therapeutic bridge 30 year , demonstrable advantage management condition include tracheal obstruction chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . In theory , use Heliox21 reduce work breathe improve balance work demand capacity process wean patient mechanical ventilation . In general study use Heliox21 extubation limit . Thus , aim extend knowledge potential role Heliox21 post-extubation environment Intensive Care Unit . Whilst Heliox21 generally administer simple face-mask ( +/- rebreathing bag ) , development HAMILTON G5 AVEA ventilator allow accurate administration Heliox21 ( 21 % helium/79 % oxygen ) define inspired fractional oxygen concentration . This advent offer mean safely administer helium adjunct non-invasive ventilatory support . Main inclusion criterion : All patient predict requirement post extubation non-invasive ventilatory support continuous positive airway pressure/bilevel positive airway pressure/noninvasive ventilation ( CPAP/BiPAP/NIV ) eligible . The primary outcome measure : The difference frequency tidal volume ( f/VT ) ratio* four hour Heliox21 f/VT ratio four hour Air O2 .</detailed_description>
