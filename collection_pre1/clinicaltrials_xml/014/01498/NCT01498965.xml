	<brief_summary>The Departments Paediatrics Child Health , Obstetrics/Gynaecology Nutritional Sciences , University College Cork , Department Dermatology , Trinity College , Dublin unique urgent opportunity form birth cohort 2000 child whose growth maternal health status closely monitor early pregnancy . Longitudinal monitoring infant allow direct investigation several research area way previously possible Ireland , abroad . The investigator propose focus three main research theme : effect intrauterine growth restriction , incidence prevalence food allergy eczema early childhood incidence effect maternal infant vitamin D status growth health Irish child . Although investigator initial proposal focus important area , formation birth cohort offer many opportunity research cohort grow old . It form unique bio-bank information Irish child collect longitudinally soon conception . The mother infant currently recruit , leave u narrow window opportunity put place pathway investigation child . To ignore opportunity would lose access wealth information regard child health disease . The potential cohort provide definitive answer current , future , theory disease causation enormous .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cork BASELINE Birth Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS : Our underlie aim establish prospective paediatric birth cohort access detail information maternal health , fetal growth , childhood nutrition , growth development first 2 year life . This cohort advantage store biobank maternal fetal plasma , serum DNA . This cohort allow u monitor effect intrauterine growth nutrition early life illness . Our specific aim : 1 . To establish fetal early life growth trajectory foretell later neurocognitive disability metabolic disorder 2 . To establish incidence prevalence food allergy eczema Irish child investigate relationship Vitamin D deficiency allergic disorder early childhood . 3 . To establish prevalence maternal neonatal vitamin D deficiency Irish paediatric population Introduction : There increase evidence intrauterine environment important effect , fetal growth , also life-long health child . A term infant end result nine month immunological nutritional interplay fetus , placenta mother . Therefore , surprising nutritional hormonal environment far-reaching effect childhood health adult health risk . Fetal nutritional status repeatedly link adult risk hypertension , hypercholesterolaemia , Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Fetal growth restriction may associate neurocognitive delay long term behavioural problem . We know maternal vitamin D status direct effect bone growth , neonate , also bone mass fracture risk adolescent offspring . More recently evidence maternal vitamin D E deficiency may contribute substantial proportion increase incidence childhood asthma . It clear , , establish pathophysiology many childhood disease need look back long birth . Previous large birth cohort UK add greatly current knowledge paediatric health disease . However early ALSPAC cohort study examine `` Children Nineties '' access detail serial fetal scan SCOPE study provide BASELINE . The recent Southampton Women 's Study recruit similar number maternal fetal dyad . The SWS study protocol include fetal scanning store DNA , cord biobank serum plasma sample . The BASELINE study access maternal blood sampling , detailed health questionnaire , serial fetal scan multiple aliquot store umbilical cord blood . In addition study provide reference data Irish child , something overseas cohorts provide Irish health care planner provider . We believe BASELINE study Ireland 's opportunity establish longitudinal birth cohort potential answer important question study disease early life , later childhood beyond . We able identify risk factor common disorder diabetes , eczema asthma . The BASELINE genetic biobank allow u examine candidate genetic marker disorder arise cohort . This study potential transform landscape paediatric research Ireland .</detailed_description>
