	<brief_title>Phase I Study 5-Fluorouracil Children Young Adults With Recurrent Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial 5-FU dosage 500 mg/m^2 administer day 1 course 1 . We plan treat maximum 3 cohort research participant ( dosage level - 0 , 1 , 2 ) escalate dose 5-FU . A cycle define 42 day . The first 6 week therapy constitute dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period . Primary objective - To investigate safety pharmacokinetics ( plasma cerebrospinal fluid ) weekly bolus dose 5-FU child young adult recurrent/refractory ependymoma - To study safety 500 mg/m^2 weekly bolus dose 5-FU less-heavily pre-treated child young adult recurrent/refractory ependymoma . Secondary objective - To document describe toxicity associate 5-FU administered weekly bolus schedule - To document preliminary antitumor activity participant recurrent refractory ependymoma treat 5-FU - To assess feasibility measure expression level Thymidylate Synthetase ( TYMS ) formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) tumor sample use Quantigene assay - To evaluate association specific genetic polymorphism ( e.g. , DPYD ) pharmacokinetics 5-FU</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant must recurrent refractory intracranial spinal ependymoma ( include myxopapillary , clear cell , papillary , tanycytic anaplastic ependymoma subependymoma ) . The diagnosis must confirm pathologist tissue obtain either initial diagnosis time recurrence prior registration . Participants may two prior systemic anticancer chemotherapy regimen , include chemotherapy , biologic modifier small molecule . These may give either irradiation . Participant must &lt; 22 year ( eligible 22nd birthday ) age time enrollment . Negative test DPYD*2 time prior enrollment ( need within 7 day ) Neurologic deficit : Participants neurological deficit stable improve neurologic exam minimum 1 week prior study registration . Performance level : Karnofsky Performance Scale ( participant &gt; 16 year age ) Lansky Performance Score ( participant ≤ 16 year age ) must &gt; 30 within two week prior registration . Chemotherapy : Participants must receive last dose know myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy least four week prior study registration least six week nitrosurea . At least two week must lapse participant receive low dose oral etoposide ( 50 mg/m^2 ) without experience evidence myelosuppression ( i.e. , neutropenia require transfusion blood product ) . Biologic agent : Participant must recover toxicity potentially related agent receive last dose biologic agent ≥ 7 day prior study registration . For biologic agent prolonged halflife , appropriate interval since last treatment discuss PI prior registration . Monoclonal antibody treatment : At least three halflives must elapse prior registration . Such participant discuss PI prior registration XRT : No two prior radiation regimen . For participant prior irradiation treatment ependymoma . XRT must : ≥ 6 month prior registration treat craniospinal irradiation ( ≥ 18 Gy ) ≥ 4 week prior registration treat focal irradiation primary tumor ≥ 2 week prior registration treat focal irradiation symptomatic metastatic site Bone marrow stem cell transplant : Participant must ≥ 3 month since high dose chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell rescue prior registration Anticonvulsants : Participants seizure disorder may enrol well control antiepileptic drug . Corticosteroids : Participants take corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior registration .

Neupogen® ) . Adequate organ function time study enrollment define follow : Laboratory value must assess within 7 day prior registration must repeat initial lab do great 7 calendar day prior start therapy : Bone marrow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 500/μL , platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL ( transfusion independent ) , hemoglobin concentration ≥ 8g/dL ( may transfuse ) Renal : Normal serum creatinine concentration base age GFR &gt; 70ml/min/1.73m^2 Hepatic : Total bilirubin concentration &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal age ; SGPT SGOT &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants may previously treat 5FU Participants receive anticancer experimental treatment Participants uncontrolled infection Participants concomitant significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy , would compromise participant 's ability tolerate therapy , impair evaluation side effect related treatment , alter drug metabolism Females childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior study entry . Participants child bear potential must agree use effective contraceptive method . Participants must breastfeed study</criteria>
