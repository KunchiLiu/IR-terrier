	<brief_summary>Approximately 12 % stroke United States hemorrhagic.1 Hemorrhagic stroke lead multiple complication include fever infectious . Identifying cause fever help physician choose best care patient try prevent damage already injured brain . Bacterial infection one possible cause fever stroke patient ; however incorrect diagnosis infection lead unnecessary antibiotic use . Better screening tool infection develop help fight problem antibiotic resistance unnecessary antibiotic use . Unnecessary use antibiotic patient increase risk adverse event overall healthcare cost . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) one screen tool use previously help tell apart bacterial nonbacterial cause infection disease state ; however , PCT study hemorrhagic stroke patient . The purpose study understand progress PCT hemorrhagic stroke patient order see whether PCT useful marker infection patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke second lead killer worldwide third lead cause death United States . The two major mechanism cause brain damage stroke , ischemia hemorrhage . Several complication arise cerebral insult range minor neurologic dysfunction , complete immobility , death . In intensive care set , clinician combat pathophysiologic process lead aforementioned sequelae stroke contest acute issue may may secondary stroke , one issue hyperthermia . Hyperthermia define Society Critical Care Medicine temperature great 38.3Â°C . In one prospective study , hyperthermia report occur 43 % patient first week hospitalization follow ischemic hemorrhagic ( exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage ) stroke . Hyperthermia stroke patient detrimental lead increased infarct size worsen neurological outcome . The etiology hyperthermia may clear upon initial evaluation cessation fever essential prevent damage . One possible cause hyperthermia stroke patient bacterial infection . Infection complicate cerebral insult lead poor functional outcome increase mortality . Kilpatrick colleague find fever occurred 47 % patient admit either traumatic ischemic brain injury 70 % patient receive least one antibiotic within 24 hour febrile episode , however antibiotic effect control fever . With bacterial resistance ever increase , vital clinician reserve antibiotic patient source fever believe secondary infectious process . It estimate United States health care system spend $ 20 billion annually antibiotic-resistant infection infection result eight million additional hospital day . Antibiotic use across health care discipline estimate administer either inappropriately unnecessarily 50 % time . Considering clinical symptom infection mirror disease process , reliable diagnostic biomarkers would useful help determine appropriate diagnosis . PCT 116 amino acid peptide sequence identical calcitonin lack hormonal activity . PCT first utilize Assicot et al setting sepsis help determine whether inflammatory response patient secondary bacterial infection . Since finding , PCT show several study high sensitivity specificity indicate systemic bacterial infection . During infection PCT secrete bloodstream without increase calcitonin . PCT show prospectively elevated patient bacterial infection remain consistently low patient infected virus inflammatory process . Often insult , body utilizes proteins metabolic product , change note substance often use marker inflammation . Unlike erythryocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , PCT remain low inflammatory state . Furthermore , show PCT level increase early stimulation ( 3-6hrs ) compare C-reactive protein ( 12-24hrs ) , indicate PCT utilized rapidly detect bacterial infection . Normal PCT level adult le 0.1 ng/mL PCT value great 0.5ng/mL determine predictive bacterial infection . PCT evaluate several clinical scenario help determine bacterial versus non-bacterial source infection , however , knowledge , effect hemorrhagic stroke PCT yet know . Determining natural history PCT hemorrhagic stroke patient would provide beneficial information whether PCT use biomarker population help differentiate bacterial non-bacterial cause hyperthermia .</detailed_description>
