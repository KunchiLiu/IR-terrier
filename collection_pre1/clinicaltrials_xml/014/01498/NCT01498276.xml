	<brief_summary>Background : - Family-based approach reduce disease risk promote healthy behavior may better target individual . Risk assessment base family health history may help educate family disease risk encourage change physical activity food choice .

Objectives : - To determine mother influence diet health-related behavior . - To study intervention tool connects family health history disease risk . Eligibility : - 18 year age least one child living home . Design : - Participants complete survey phone . The survey take 30 40 minute complete . The survey collect family health history heart disease , diabetes , colorectal cancer , breast cancer . - Researchers give participant Family Health Package ( FHP ) . The FHP provide information family health history disease risk . It also recommend behavior reduce health risk . - Two week send FHP , participant complete phone survey FHP material social network . - Some participant invite focus group . The focus group explore diet health behavior . They look food purchasing preparation meal share . The group also discuss attitude toward healthy eat physical activity . Each focus group last 1 2 hour . - Participants ask complete electronic survey regard participant health status , causal health belief , risk perception , intention communicate health information . - Then , participant opportunity use electronic version FHP , assess family health history . - After use FHeP , participant complete short electronic survey identify knowledge understanding gain use application , change communication intention , suggestion improvement application . - Upon completion electronic portion study , study team member conduct semi-structured interview allow participant qualitatively evaluate user experience , include satisfaction usefulness . - This study process take approximately 60-90 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lifestyle behavior , diet physical activity , link development number disease , include cancer , diabetes , heart disease . Adopting healthy diet preventive health practice effective way reduce associate disease . However , cancer , diabetes , heart disease etiologically complex multiple risk factor ( e.g. , genetic , environmental , lifestyle ) tend cluster family . Thus , family important social context intervention lifestyle-focused disease prevention . Our previous research indicate intergenerational encouragement motivate behavior change parent woman tend natural encouragers health behavior . Therefore , mixed-method pilot study conduct explore dietary habit healthy behavior transmit across family generation motivational influence family health history regard disease associate overweight diet improve health behavior . This pilot study also assess participant comprehension intervention tool outline family health history disease risk assessment use large intervention study . Participants paper-based Family Health Package ( FHP ) Evaluation Phase recruit exist database develop Immersive Virtual Environment Testing Area ( IVETA ) within Social Behavioral Research Branch , NHGRI , consist mother Washington , DC area , local advertisement post clinicaltrials.gov . Participants complete survey interview , provide u detailed family health history . From information , create paper-based FHP send participant , consist pedigree , disease risk algorithm , health guideline . Participants invite complete follow-up survey interview , focus group conduct subset participant . Two initial focus group provide feedback feasibility acceptability FHP material . After incorporate revision , additional focus group evaluate FHP material . All focus group also explore diet health behavior semi-structured question . Thematic analysis identify factor influence health behavior across generation potential impact parent initiate maintain food choice within household influence family origin choice . Additional evaluation may conduct , necessary , improve FHP reach diverse population . The paper-based version FHP translate electronic version , Family Health ePortal ( FHeP ) . Participants electronic Family Health ePortal ( FHeP ) Evaluation Phase recruit general population local advertisement post clinicaltrials.gov . Eligible participant consent invited access FHeP . The initial FHeP Evaluation Phase participant access FHeP individually provide feedback feasibility acceptability FHeP material survey semi-structured interview . After incorporate revision , subsequent participant ask invite family member access FHeP evaluate FHeP material . FHeP participant provide demographic , diet , health behavior information pre- post-test survey well survey item within FHeP . Additional evaluation wave may conduct , necessary , improve FHeP increase reach diverse population . We anticipate outcome evaluation 1 ) provide u effective intervention tool health education minimize disease risk within family , 2 ) inform future intervention research . Further study direct toward provide family member appropriate tool act family genetic health educator order disseminate disease risk information encourage health promote behavior .</detailed_description>
