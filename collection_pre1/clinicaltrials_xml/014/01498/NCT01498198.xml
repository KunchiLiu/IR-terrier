	<detailed_description>Design/Setting The present study multi-center prospective , randomize control trial examine WCB patient present Orthopaedic specialist RC pathology . Selection Criteria Adult patient active WCB claim , present confirm high-grade ( &gt; 50 % ) partial-thickness small ( ≤1cm ) full-thickness RC tear , eligible study . Informed consent attain WCB patient attend orthopaedic clinic Greater Edmonton Greater Winnipeg area . The complete list inclusion/exclusion criterion follow : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Patient 18 year age 2 . Patient active WCB Claim 3 . Patient high-grade ( &gt; 50 % ) partial-thickness small ( &lt; 1cm ) full-thickness tear supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus , confirm appropriate diagnostic imaging ( MRI , Arthrogram , Ultrasound ) Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Patient full-thickness tear subscapularis and/or teres minor 2 . Patient low-grade ( &lt; 50 % ) partial-thickness tear supraspinatus/infraspinatus 3 . Patient moderate large ( &gt; 1cm ) full-thickness tear supraspinatus/infraspinatus 4 . Patient undergone previous RC surgery affect shoulder 5 . Patient major joint trauma , infection , avascular necrosis 6 . Patient chronic dislocation , inflammation , degenerative glenohumeral arthropathy 7 . Patient evidence significant cuff arthropathy ( superior glenohumeral translation and/or acromial erosion , diagnose diagnostic imaging ) 8 . Patient psychiatric illness , cognitive impairment , health condition ( i.e . visual impairment ) preclude informed consent render patient unable complete study questionnaires 9 . Patient major medical illness life expectancy le 2 year 10 . Patient speak/read/understand English 11 . Patient fix address mean contact 12 . Patient unwilling complete necessary follow-up Enrollment Procedures Immediately follow orthopedic consultation consultation screen physician , patient introduce study . If patient express interest , Research Coordinator discus study detail ( goal , requirement patient , expect outcome , benefit , risk ) patient . Informed consent obtain interested patient . It expect patient see orthopaedic surgeon within three-six month initial present incident . Baseline Evaluation Consented patient undergo pre-operative assessment study physical therapist . The assessment consist 1 ) shoulder ROM , 2 ) shoulder strength use handheld myometer ( microFET3 , Hoggan Health Industries Inc. , West Jordan , UT ) , 3 ) demographic ( age , gender , height , weight , handedness , smoke status , recreational sport , date injury , mechanism injury ) data , 4 ) work-related question ( i.e . occupation , employment status , type work perform ) . The subject also complete Western Ontario Rotator Cuff ( WORC ) Index . Randomization Upon completion baseline assessment ( ensure blinding ) , patient randomize one two study group . Randomization stratify type tear ( full vs. partial thickness ) , surgeon . Patients Group A ( non-operative ) refer physical therapy ( PT ) . Patients Group B ( expedite surgery ) book surgery , complete soon possible ( within 3 month ) . Intervention Group A ( non-operative ) complete standardize PT regime . The therapy program recommend WCB Winnipeg follow compliance program monitor . Typically , consist ROM , strengthen , scapular stabilization functional exercise , well pain control modality manual therapy technique , appropriate . Assessments take place weekly treating therapist . If subject show sign progression , rehabilitation regimen stop 6 week subject return orthopaedic surgeon discussion treatment option , include surgery . No progression determine follow : subject 's total WORC score change less 10 % previous assessment ( baseline ) treat PT indicate shoulder improve worsen ( use global rating change questionnaire - See attached document ) . If subject make progress PT , treatment continue additional 4-6 week weekly assessment progress . PT continue long indicate , include subject 's return work . If time , subject determine stop progress PT ( base comparison previous visit ) require evaluation , he/her return orthopaedic surgeon discussion option include surgery . Group B ( expedite surgery ) receive rotator cuff repair surgery . At time surgery , attend surgeon record RC defect repair detail use standardized form . Follow-up Evaluations Group A1- Effective Non-operative Management : Research re-assessments conduct study physical therapist 6 12 week , 6 12 month commence PT . These re-assessments repeat measurement take baseline evaluation also include form return work status . Group A2- Failed Non-operative Management : If subject non-operative group fail progress point PT program , return orthopaedic surgeon discussion treatment option , include surgery . Re-assessments occur interval Group A1 time receive surgery ( within initial 12-month follow-up ) . If candidate deem operative undergo surgery , follow postoperative interval expedite surgery group ( namely 6 12weeks 6 12 month postoperatively ) However , postoperative follow-up subject cross surgery group non-operative group may less 12 month study stop last expedited surgery subject reach 12 month postoperative prevent delay complete study ) . Group B- Expedited Surgery : Research re-assessments conduct study physical therapist 6 12 week , 6 12 month postoperatively . At 6 12 week , ROM WORC score complete well work status . At 6 12 month postoperatively , re-assessments repeat measurement take baseline evaluation also include form return work status . Outcomes The primary outcome present study time return final work status . The secondary outcome time return work status ( i.e . modified duty ) . Finally , also evaluate characteristic ( demographic , tear- , work-related , ROM strength , self-efficacy ) associate successful outcome among patient group . The overall goal study determine whether PT follow surgery expedite surgery result faster return work injury approach associate best patient outcomes within 12-months . We also hope identify sub-groups one approach effective allow optimal delivery care . Outcome Measures Time Return Work To answer primary research question , time return work ( day ) calculate . This define interval date orthopedic consultation/screening final return work status . We also determine time return work status . Demographics At patient 's pre-operative ( baseline ) assessment , complete list demographic information record . These include patient 's contact information , age , gender , height , weight , handedness , smoke status , date injury , injury mechanism , occupation , employment status , type work perform , recreational sport ( type/frequency ) compete . Patients also ask particular previous physical therapy regimen ( , start/stop date , many session attend ) , well non-operative treatment ( cortisone , massage therapy , chiropractic , acupuncture ) . Range Motion Range motion ( ROM ) assessment conduct study physical therapist perform shoulder flexion , abduction , external rotation ( neutral abduction , 90° elbow flexion ) , external rotation ( 90° abduction , 90° elbow flexion ) , internal rotation ( 90° abduction , 90° elbow flexion ) . Active passive ROM measure operative unaffected shoulder . ROM value express raw value , well percentage ROM compare unaffected shoulder . Strength Strength assessment also conduct study physical therapist baseline , 6-month , 12-month interval . Isometric shoulder flexion , abduction , external rotation internal rotation measure patient 's arm neutral ( neutral abduction , 90° elbow flexion ) . Strength measure use dynamometer . Peak value record contraction , hold 3 second . Strength value express raw value , well percentage strength compare unaffected shoulder . WORC Index The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index ( WORC ) [ 9 ] five-part ( physical symptom , sports/recreation , work , lifestyle , emotion ) , 21-item , disease-specific questionnaire assess quality life among patient RC pathology . This index show valid , reliable responsive rotator cuff patient population . Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire ( OMPQ ) validate instrument examines subject 's ability manage pain daily life . It predictive subject 's ability return work follow injury use initial assessment . Sample Size Calculation Currently , mean WCB claim duration Albertan RC patient approximately 9 month ( 270 day ) [ 8 ] . In order statistical power 85 % detect 10 % difference outcome ( deem clinically important WCB stakeholder ) [ 8 ] group ( s=49 day ; a=0.05 ; b=0.15 ) , 60 patient require per group . In order allow subject attrition , patient may complete assessment due early WCB claim closure , allow adequate power subsequent multivariate regression modeling , 20 % over-sample rate apply . Therefore , total 132 patient recruit ( 66 per group ) [ 9 ] . Data Analysis All study data come primary source ( patient assessment , surgical report form , date return work modify full work status ) . Descriptive statistic ( frequency , mean , standard deviation ) calculate study variable . Level statistical significance set α=0.05 . All analysis perform use Statistical Packages Social Sciences ( SPSS ) , version 16.0 ( SPSS Inc. ; Chicago , IL ) . Three different analysis take place . The first analysis , address primary research question , count day screening/orthopaedic surgeon consultation return final work status ( e.g either full modified duty ) . In analysis , subject non-operative group consider 1 group regardless whether eventually undergo surgery . If subject yet return work study deem complete , give maximum span day study ( i.e . entry last date study ) . This analysis give overall comparison expedite surgery vs. initial non-operative management +/- surgical intervention , ( reflect current standard care ) . The second analysis look proportion subject 'fail ' non-operative management . In analysis , also try identify characteristic associate successful non-operative management vs. fail non-operative management . The third analysis examine outcomes amongst successful non-operative management , receive expedite surgery underwent initial non-operative management follow surgical intervention . This allow u determine impact delay surgery subject ' final outcome surgery result different outcomes non-operative management . As present project ass human subject , ethic approval obtain institutional Research Ethics Boards ( REB ) University Manitoba University Alberta .</detailed_description>
