	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b , randomize study healthy young ( 18-50 year ) old ( 51-70 year ) adults evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost vaccination regimen investigational plasmid DNA vaccine direct towards 2011/12 influenza vaccine strain prime follow 36 week later 2012/13 influenza trivalent inactivate vaccine ( TIV ) booster injection , compare placebo prime follow 2012/13 seasonal TIV . The hypothesis DNA vaccine safe human administration DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule elicit good immune response seasonal TIV alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seasonal Influenza DNA Vaccine Prime With Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine ( TIV ) Boost Compared TIV Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccines effective way prevent influenza infection transmission human . Although licensed influenza vaccine available , way improve influenza vaccine continue study . Annually , World Health Organization ( WHO ) U.S FDA make recommendation composition seasonal influenza vaccine , recommendation Northern Hemisphere ( NH ) Southern Hemisphere ( SH ) consider different time base epidemiology data . The annually licensed influenza vaccine consist 3 component : Influenza A ( H1N1 ) strain , Influenza A ( H3N2 ) strain , influenza B strain . The current U.S. FDA-licensed influenza vaccine depend upon labor-intensive method limit manufacture capacity induce broad immune response various strain influenza . The vaccine composition require frequent adjustment emerge influenza strain . The need influenza vaccine immunogenic able induce universal immune response broad spectrum influenza strain well recognize . Earlier laboratory clinical study together suggest investigational DNA vaccine encode influenza hemagglutinin protein ( HA DNA vaccine ) administer prime , follow boost traditional inactivated influenza vaccine , may induce strong immune response various influenza strain improve durability . The interval time prime vaccination boost vaccination important strength immune response . This clinical trial evaluate safety , tolerability immune response investigational HA DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule compare placebo prime-TIV boost schedule time prime boost 36 week .</detailed_description>
