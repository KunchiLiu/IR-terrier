	<brief_title>Improving Oral Care Reduce Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia ( HAP ) Acute Neurologically Impaired Adult</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview Problem : Hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) second common nosocomial infection significant cause morbidity mortality . In surgical population , HAP associate 55 % increase length stay increase cost approximately $ 31,000.00 per case . Neurologically impaired patient ( brain injury cause alteration mental status , immobility , impair swallowing cough , increase risk aspiration ) particularly vulnerable HAP . HAP negatively impact patient comfort satisfaction , increase cost associated diagnostic test treatment , increase risk sepsis , potential high level care . It estimate 95 % care-dependent patient Royal Columbian Hospital ( RCH ) neuroscience unit acquire HAP stay . Gap : Research study show improve oral hygiene critical care , neuroscience intensive care unit cardiac surgery reduces incidence HAP . However , acutely ill neuroscience population outside critical care area , relationship determine . Current oral care protocol , product practitioner practice medical/surgical unit RCH neuroscience unit consider recent evidence recent increase patient acuity complexity . Goal : The goal study test efficacy improve , evidence-based oral care protocol reduce HAP population medical/surgical neuroscience unit RCH . Research question : Does implement enhance oral care protocol reduce rate HAP acute , non-intubated , care-dependent , neurologically impaired , adult patient neuroscience unit ? Objective : To measure compare incidence HAP among medical/surgical patient current standard oral care receive improve , preventative-based , oral hygiene protocol include regular teeth brushing , mouth tongue inspection , swab moisturizing , elevation head bed ( HOB ) , change suction equipment , universal precaution . Relevance : This study may identify importance standardize oral hygiene protocol evidence , heighten awareness among care provider prevention HAP . If prove successful , oral care protocol could consider implementation acute unit outside RCH neuro unit .</detailed_description>
