	<criteria>Pathologically document EBV antigen positive lymphoproliferative disease , lymphoma EBVassociated malignancy . OR Evaluable disease demonstrate clinical and/or radiologic study current prior elevate blood level EBV DNA exceed 500 copies/ml quantitative real time PCR . OR Persistent recurrent elevation level EBV DNA exceed 500 copies/ml patient previously treat EBVLPD chemotherapy and/or rituximab yet clinically radiologically evaluable disease high risk disease recurrence . EBVspecific T cell available adoptive immune cell therapy consent third party donor . The third party EBVCTLs administer select basis two criterion : 1 ) match least 2 HLA antigen 2 ) restrict allele share EBV+ malignancy ( know ) , donor HSCT recipient , patient organ transplant immunodeficient patient KPS Lansky score ≥ 20 . A life expectancy least 6 week . Adequate bone marrow , heart , lung , liver kidney function time treatment EBVspecificT cell initiate , include : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/µL , without GCSF support 2 . Platelets ≥ 20,000/µL 3 . Creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl 4 . ALT , AST &lt; 3.0x total bilirubin &lt; 2.5x institutional ULN 5 . Stable blood pressure circulation require pressor support 6 . Adequate cardiac function demonstrate EKG and/or echocardiographic evidence ( may perform within 30 day prior treatment ) However , abnormality specific organ consider ground exclusion result EBV+ malignancy treatment ( e.g . renal allograft recipient EBV LPD may dialysis allograft reject immune suppression stop first approach treatment EBV LPD ) . At discretion investigator , patient elevate stable creatinine preclude treatment study . There age restriction eligibility protocol . It expect five type patient afflict EBVassociated lymphoma , lymphoproliferative disease malignancy refer consent participate trial . These : 1 . Patients develop EBV lymphoma lymphoproliferative disorder follow allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) ( ie , marrow , PBSC , umbilical cord blood ) . 2 . Patients develop EBV lymphoma lymphoproliferative disorder follow allogeneic organ transplant . 3 . Patients AIDS develop EBV lymphoma lymphoproliferative disease consequence profound acquire immunodeficiency induce HIV . 4 . Patients develop EBV lymphoma lymphoproliferative disease EBVassociated malignancy consequence profound immunodeficiency associate congenital immune deficit acquire sequela antineoplastic immunosuppressive therapy . 5 . Patients develop EBVassociated malignancy without preexist immune deficiency , include : EBV+ Hodgkin 's NonHodgkin 's disease , EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma , EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , EBV+ leiomyosarcoma . The following patient exclude study : Patients active ( grade 24 ) acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) , chronic GVHD overt autoimmune disease ( e.g . hemolytic anemia ) require high dos glucocorticosteroid ( &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) treatment Patients pregnant Patients severe comorbidities , relate EBVassociated malignancy , would expect preclude survival 6 week require assess response T cell therapy Patients eligible MSK protocol # 16803 ( EBVCTL201 )</criteria>
