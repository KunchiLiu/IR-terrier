	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ipilimumab work give together androgen suppression therapy treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread part body . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Androgen cause growth prostate cancer . Androgen deprivation therapy may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Giving ipilimumab together androgen suppression therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Combination With Androgen Suppression Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Proportion patient achieve undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ( = &lt; 0.2 ng/ml ) initiation ipilimumab therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time PSA progression . II . Time progression measure . III . Maximum percentage PSA reduction patient . IV . Number patient immune related adverse event ( IRAEs ) correlation complete PSA response , time progression , T cell measurement . V. Measures T cell response therapy flow cytometry . VI . Response measurable disease modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . VII . Time death cause . VIII . To examine correlative biomarkers relationship clinical outcome . Potential biomarkers include , limited C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 -2 , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) . XV . Bank sample future molecular correlative study , biomarker , study . OUTLINE : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without progression receive maintenance ipilimumab IV every 3 month 4 additional dos . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
