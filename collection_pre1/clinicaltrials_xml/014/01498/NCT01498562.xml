	<brief_title>Phase II Study Gefitinib Plus Nimotuzumab Versus Gefitinib Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , gefitinib , show effective patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , patient almost invariably develop resistance TKIs disease progression . Nimotuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody target EGFR . Combining nimotuzumab gefitinib may potentiate cellular cytotoxicity , may also assist overcome inherent acquire resistance gefitinib alone .</detailed_description>
