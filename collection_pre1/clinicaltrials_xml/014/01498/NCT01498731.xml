	<brief_summary>Acute chest pain commonly know classic symptom acute myocardial infarction . Of many patient visit Emergency Department chest pain , less half actually suffer acute myocardial infarction acute myocardial ischemia . In patient acute myocardial infarction diagnose admission , either typical change ECG ( STEMI , ST-elevation myocardial infarction ) increase level laboratory value Troponin blood ( NSTEMI , Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ) . Troponin currently important marker diagnose acute myocardial infarction . Unfortunately lot patient suspect acute coronary syndrome show ECG Troponin change . These patient pose major problem emergency medicine need precautionally admit chest pain unit start medical treatment second Troponin test 6-9 hour available . In study , investigate biomarker Copeptin . Copeptin show excellent result diagnostic clinical trial assess use various acute disease . There three important trial show excellent negative predictive value Copeptin combination Troponin patient suspect acute coronary syndrome ( Reichlin et al. , JACC , 2009 ; Keller et al . JACC , 2010 , Giannitsis et al . Clin Chem 2011 ) . This trial compare two process manage patient suspect acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , standard process accord current guideline experimental process integrate copeptin rule-out marker acute myocardial infarction management decision . Main Hypothesis : Patients suspect ACS test negative Troponin negative Copeptin initial presentation ED safely discharge ( interventional process ) . They experience major cardiac adverse event patient manage standard practise ( control process ) within 30 day admission . The Investigators want test Copeptin patient suspect acute coronary syndrome ECG unspecific initial Troponin test negative . Further patient care base Copeptin result . Patients negative Copeptin discharge ambulant care resident cardiologists.Copeptin positive patient manage accord standard guideline management patient ACS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Biomarker Copeptin Managing Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management patient suspect Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEACS ) time-consuming expensive . Often patient need hospitalize precautionary medical treatment serial Troponin testing decision make . Copeptin , 39 amino acid glycopeptide , C-terminal portion Pro-Vasopressin . It co-secreted posterior pituitary gland together Vasopressin mirror amount Vasopressin circulation . Vasopressin primarily know Anti-Diuretic Hormone ( ADH ) , act kidney regulate body 's retention water high concentration cause arterial vasoconstriction . Vasopressin , central hormone , also crucial part hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis , respond severe , life-threatening `` stress input '' ; level reflect body 's individual stress level.Vasopressin half-life 5-10 minute therefore difficult measure in-vivo . Copeptin secrete stoichiometrically Vasopressin , remain stable day blood withdrawal therefore easily measure . Copeptin study diagnostic prognostic marker since 2006 . In acute myocardial infarction Copeptin level show increase early onset symptom ( 0-4 hour ) start decrease 4-5 hour . In acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) Copeptin level increase early onset symptom . In patient suspected ACS Copeptin level significantly high patient AMI patient diagnosis . Copeptin conjunction Troponin T particularly useful rule-out marker AMI . This randomize control diagnostic trial quantify benefit integrate Copeptin management process patient NSTEACS negative baseline Troponin I test result Chest Pain Unit ( CPU ) . Patient management depend Copeptin rather serial Troponin result . Patients randomize either standard group ( management accord current guideline manage patient ACS , Copeptin test , result reveal treating personnel ) interventional group ( Copeptin test , management dependent Copeptin result ) . In interventional group , patient negative baseline Copeptin discharge ambulant care co-operating resident cardiologist . Patients positive Copeptin result treat standard care ( like patient control group ) . The investigator assess efficacy safety new process compare standard process . Secondary endpoint assess patient satisfaction length hospital stay . This study design assess diagnostic use also clinical relevance Copeptin test ED/CPU . Consecutive N-STEACS patient Chest Pain Unit negative Troponin I admission invited participate . Troponin I test part standard management patient suspect acute coronary syndrome point care test device ( POCT ) . Patients give write informed consent randomize one two study arm ( experimental standard management ) management depend Copeptin result admission .</detailed_description>
