	<brief_title>Knee Articular Cartilage Repair : Cartilage Autograft Implantation System Versus Conventional Microfracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Articular cartilage limit potential regeneration , full-thickness cartilage defect knee frequently symptomatic debilitating . If leave untreated , injury may progress generalized osteoarthritis . The management injury remain unsatisfactory despite intense research activity , clinical social impact problem growing , involve often young active . Numerous surgical technique develop treat injury , none yet show superior . One widely employ best-studied mean achieve cartilage repair patient discrete region chondral destruction knee microfracture . Microfracture arthroscopic technique involve penetrate subchondral bone base full-thickness articular cartilage defect , thus allow marrow pluripotent stem cell egress chondral defect , facilitate cartilage repair . However , doubt raise concern quality durability microfracture-induced repair tissue . In recent year , autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI ) emerge technique great potential advance management chondral injury . In procedure , autologous chondrocytes harvest non-critical area articular surface , expand cell culture laboratory , implant 4-6 week later chondral defect , use 'patch ' adjacent periosteum containment cell within defect . There several disadvantage ACI technique describe : two-stage procedure , chondrocyte culture lengthy expensive , periosteal patch use contain cell associate significant risk complication detachment hypertrophy . 2nd generation ACI technique focus address problem substitute periosteum patch artificial membrane serve scaffold culture chondrocytes . A novel technique recently develop could prove avoid deficiency ACI technique . The Cartilage Autograft Implantation System ( CAIS ) single-stage procedure cartilage harvest non-critical region articular cartilage , immediately morcellated load onto polymer membrane-scaffold , subsequently use fill chondral defect . The autograft-membrane composite fix defect biodegradable staple . We aim evaluate new technique pilot clinical trial involve 36 patient randomized microfracture CAIS treatment arm ( randomisation ratio 1:2 ) , minimum follow-up 1 year , use clinical radiological ( magnetic resonance imaging ) outcomes . If result pilot trial successful , plan expand study recruiting patient achieve suitably-powered trial . Primary hypothesis 1 : That functional score increase least 0.5 SD pre-operative value , 1 year follow CAIS procedure Primary hypothesis 2 : That articular cartilage height sustain increase least 2 mm 1 year follow CAIS procedure Primary hypothesis 3 : That functional score CAIS group equivalent superior microfracture group</detailed_description>
