	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Antibiotics Management Children With Community-Acquired Abscess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence community acquire methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) pervasive cause skin soft tissue infection increase number child require incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) procedure heighten concern optimal treatment strategy . Data patient methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) abscesses , well emerge data child minor MRSA skin soft tissue abscesses suggest I &amp; D alone sufficient therapy . However , give concern pathogenicity MRSA infection , many patient require hospital admission I &amp; D operating room receive postoperative antibiotic . The primary objective randomize control trial compare effect 5 day versus 1 day postoperative antibiotic rate treatment failure follow I &amp; D abscesses child era pervasive MRSA infection . Secondary outcome measure include incidence additional skin soft tissue infection body sit incidence infection family member household contact . Prospective data collect wound culture , well nasal , rectal skin culture send time initial I &amp; D ass MRSA carrier status . Finally , survey data use ass epidemiologic risk factor .</detailed_description>
