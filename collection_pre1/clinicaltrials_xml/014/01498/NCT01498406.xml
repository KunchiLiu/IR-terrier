	<brief_summary>Lupus disease immune system , normally fights infection , begin attack healthy cell body . This phenomenon call autoimmunity immune system attack call autoantigen . Lupus affect many part body often affect skin , immune cell attack autoantigens skin cause rash . This rash often visible public tend occur sun-exposed area , example patient 's face , chest , arm . For reason , among others , skin lupus source disability poor health relate quality life many patient disease . It completely understand someone might develop lupus , however likely many reason include genetics also kind environment live . One environmental factor , vitamin D , commonly know vitamin important bone health . However , learn vitamin D effect body , also important healthy immune system . Low level vitamin D associate increase risk autoimmune disorder diabetes multiple sclerosis , also find common skin lupus patient . Vitamin D make skin expose sun , specifically ultraviolet B radiation ( UVB ) . The main source vitamin D people production skin normal American diet high vitamin D. However , patient skin lupus tend stay sun rash make bad sunlight , think produce autoantigens skin attack immune system . Additionally , skin doctor ( dermatologist ) recommend sun protection skin lupus patient minimize sun-sensitivity prevent flare skin disease . However may put risk low vitamin D status even severe disease . Another risk factor put skin lupus patient risk vitamin D deficiency patient generally darker skin type block UVB limit vitamin D production skin . Given skin lupus patient high risk low vitamin D status mention , investigator propose research study provide information vitamin D level patient . The investigator seek identify many skin lupus patient low vitamin D status vitamin D influence natural history skin disease . Additionally investigator evaluate whether supplementation high dose vitamin D lessen severity negative quality life impact skin lupus . Supplementation vitamin D mouth inexpensive , well tolerate , safe counter method replete maintain normal vitamin D status . Studies autoimmune disease , specifically Crohn 's disease multiple sclerosis , show high dose vitamin D supplementation improve disease severity . It hope investigator also observe skin lupus patient . In summary , investigator seek move beyond establish association vitamin D status skin lupus . The investigator aim elucidate therapeutic benefit , , vitamin D status disease severity quality life control important factor may influence vitamin D status . If investigator show improvement disease severity vitamin D supplementation , would cost-effective additional therapy standard clinical practice . Future research would also allow u investigate alternative marker vitamin D deficiency disease activity skin lupus patient , population high risk low vitamin D status need research .</brief_summary>
