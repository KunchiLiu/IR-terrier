	<detailed_description>Although introduction multimodal treatment soft tissue sarcoma result great progress STS treatment , local failure still occur 10-20 % STS patient . Therefore improvement local systemic treatment need order achieve tumor control limb salvage . The propose study treatment combine external beam radiation orally administer sunitinib . Sunitinib multiple receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor anti-angiogenic anti-tumoral property . For key role tumor development , RTKs regard excellent target cancer chemotherapy . External beam radiation widely use neoadjuvant treatment locally advance soft tissue sarcoma . The concurrent application anti-angiogenic sunitinib appear reasonable , since STS highly vascularize tumor overexpression VEGFR RTKs show various histologic soft tissue sarcoma subtypes . At first sight , combination antiangiogenic treatment radiation seem contradictory , since anti-angiogenic treatment attack tumor vasculature radiation effect decrease hypoxia . Yet , animal study concurrent application radiation tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib antiangiogenic agent result additive , synergistic antitumoral effect . These result explain superiority anti-tumoral activity antiangiogenic agent hypoxia relate , radiation weakening effect ; hypothesis vascular normalization . It well know tumor vasculature immature ineffective mean blood supply oxygenation . In preclinical model , antiangiogenic agent balance pro- anti-angiogenic effector may result maturation tumor vasculature improvement blood flow oxygen supply . The combination sunitinib anti-angiogenic anti-proliferative agent thus might add therapeutic effect RTK-inhibitor external beam radiation might additionally lead radiosensitizing effect due tumor vessel normalization . The Purpose study ass toxicity combine treatment gather preliminary data treatment efficacy .</detailed_description>
