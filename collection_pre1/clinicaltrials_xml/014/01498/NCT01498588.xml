	<brief_summary>Previous study show chemotherapy effect treat breast cancer whether receive surgery . Receiving chemotherapy surgery , rather surgery , may allow patient less extensive surgery . The purpose study identify new treatment regimens good response rate find combination eribulin follow doxorubicin cyclophosphamide shrink size patient 's breast tumor allow preserve breast . Additionally , receive chemotherapy surgery , investigator able determine cancer responsive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Eribulin Followed Doxorubicin &amp; Cyclophosphamide Her2-negative , Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , single-arm , open label study . Patients Her2-negative , locally advanced breast cancer enrol study prior receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients receive 4 cycle neoadjuvant eribulin follow 4 cycle dose-dense doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) . All patient baseline biopsy prior study entry determine eligibility . Patients undergo repeat breast image optional biopsy complete 4 cycle eribulin . Patients receive 4 cycle dose-dense AC . Patients undergo repeat breast imaging follow surgical resection within 30 day complete last cycle chemotherapy . Patients surgical candidate completion chemotherapy ask undergo optional repeat biopsy prior receive additional treatment discretion investigator . Patients continue follow per standard practice guideline surgery Clinical response determine clinical breast examination prior cycle chemotherapy breast imaging perform baseline , completion eribulin , prior surgery . Pathologic complete response ( pCR ) determine time surgical resection . Correlative biomarker study perform tumor sample completion clinical trial .</detailed_description>
