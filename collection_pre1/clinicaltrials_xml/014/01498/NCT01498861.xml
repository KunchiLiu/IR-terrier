	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor currently Phase 3 clinical development treatment HIV infection . DTG likely use woman oral contraceptive ( OC ) birth control . Based accumulated non-clinical clinical drug metabolism pharmacokinetic data , low likelihood drug interaction DTG widely use OC drug . The primary objective study evaluate effect DTG administration pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics commonly use oral contraceptive product , Ortho-Cyclen ( combination norgestimate ethinyl estradiol ) , healthy female subject . Each subject participate Run-in period ( need ) , follow two treatment period . Approximately 16 subject randomize cross-over fashion either Ortho-Cyclen DTG Ortho-Cyclen Placebo 10 day switch alternate treatment another 10 day . Subjects return study center final follow evaluation 7 - 14 day final dose study medication .</brief_summary>
