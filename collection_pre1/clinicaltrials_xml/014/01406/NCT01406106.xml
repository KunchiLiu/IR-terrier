	<brief_summary>Background information Studies conduct supplement daily diet plant sterol ester-enriched milk derivative order reduce LDL-cholesterol level , consequently , cardiovascular risk . However , clinical practice guideline hypercholesterolaemia state sufficient evidence recommend use subject hypercholesterolaemia . The null hypothesis establishes relationship decrease blood LDL-cholesterol level consumption stanol ester enrich liquid yoghurt . The alternative hypothesis establishes relationship consumption incidence primary variable . The main objective study determine efficacy intake 2 g plant sterol ester day lower LDL-cholesterol level patient diagnose hypercholesterolaemia . The specific objective : 1 ) quantify efficacy daily intake plant sterol ester lower LDL-cholesterol , total cholesterol cardiovascular risk patient hypercholesterolaemia ; 2 ) evaluate occurrence adverse effect daily intake plant sterol ester ; 3 ) identify factor determine great reduction lipid level subject receive plant sterol ester supplement . Study design Randomised , double-blind , placebo control experimental trial carry family doctor ' surgery three health centre Health Area Albacete ( Spain ) . The study subject adult diagnose `` limit '' `` define '' hypercholesterolaemia LDL cholesterol level 130 mg/dl . A dairy product form liquid yoghurt contain 2 g plant sterol ester per container administer daily main meal , period 24 month . The control group receive daily unit yogurt supplement plant sterol ester similar appearance enrich yoghurt . The primary variable change lipid profile 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . The secondary variable : change cardiovascular risk , adherence dairy product , adverse effect , adherence dietary recommendation , frequency food consumption , basic physical examination data , health problem , lipid-lowering medication , physical activity , smoke habit socio-demographic variable .</brief_summary>
