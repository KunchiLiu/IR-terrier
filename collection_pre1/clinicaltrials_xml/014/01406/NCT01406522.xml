	<brief_summary>No medication currently available treatment psychostimulant addiction , compulsive preoccupation use cocaine relate compound . Tacrine , medication currently prescribe Alzheimer 's disease , decrease amount cocaine injection laboratory animal choose inject vein . This project determine tacrine also decrease cocaine-motivated behavior human subject laboratory setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Reinforcing effect cocaine believe arise release dopamine ( DA ) nucleus accumbens neuron ventral tegmental area . Activation cholinergic receptor cell body neuron enhance DA release . Elevated level acetylcholine ( ACh ) nucleus accumbens may also serve inhibit appetitive behavior . Cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine increase synaptic level ACh prevent inactivation acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) , improve learn memory . In animal , cholinesterase inhibitor attenuate cocaine self-administration condition place preference . Tacrine centrally act , reversible inhibitor AChE BuChE approve treatment Alzheimer 's disease . In addition effect cholinergic system , tacrine potentiate action monoamine , include DA . Although use tacrine decline requirement monitor potential liver toxicity pharmacokinetics necessitate multiple daily dos , potent cholinesterase inhibitor attenuate cocaine self-administration animal . Pretreatment tacrine produce long-lasting reduction cocaine-reinforced behavior rat , describe persistent attenuation ( cocaine self-administration decrease 80 % period three day additional cholinesterase inhibitor administer , see Figure 1 ) . No previous study evaluate whether tacrine modify effect cocaine human . Rationale To knowledge , tacrine compound produce persistent attenuation rat treat clinically relevant dos . If similar effect observe human , would lead important paradigm shift substance abuse treatment , large reduction cocaine-reinforced behavior could produce without need continuous dose medication . This scenario could remove requirement continue compliance oral dosing patient associate potential toxicity . Specific Aims : 1 . Evaluate whether tacrine treatment cause persistent attenuation cocaine-reinforced behavior human . 2 . Determine effectiveness pretreatment tacrine attenuate cocaine-induced craving . 3 . Evaluate plasma level cocaine characterize bioavailability tacrine individual patient . Methods This randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , inpatient , single-center , parallel-group evaluation potential oral tacrine modify cocaine self-administration , cocaine-induced craving , pharmacokinetics cocaine tacrine . To evaluate occurrence persistent attenuation , subjective reinforcing effect intravenous cocaine determine oral treatment three day follow discontinuation .</detailed_description>
