	<brief_summary>The hypothesis SAFE-PCI woman trial , compare transfemoral PCI , transradial PCI result significant reduction bleed vascular complication . The primary objective compare efficacy feasibility transradial approach percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) woman compare transfemoral approach . This study multicenter , randomize , open-label active control study . Three thousand woman undergo urgent elective PCI least 50 center randomize either transradial transfemoral PCI . Patients enrol site perform ad hoc PCI randomize diagnostic angiography . A total approximately 3000 woman randomize obtain cohort approximately 1800 patient undergo PCI . The Data Safety Monitoring Board alert u bleed event rate overall trial low , make unlikely statistical power show difference randomize arm SAFE PCI Women study use BARC bleed definition per protocol . Based statistical futility , DSMB recommend stop enrollment . They also note , however , base safety issue , since variety key secondary endpoint ( contrast radiation exposure , quality life ) clinical scientific interest , DSMB leave discretion Steering Committee continue enrollment meet sufficient power outcome . On March 1 , 2013 , Steering Committee meet discuss issue vote continue enrollment plan sample size Quality Life substudy meet ( 300 patient ) .</brief_summary>
