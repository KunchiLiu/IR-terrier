	<detailed_description>This study open label , dose characteristic study assess safety pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic consideration GSK2315698A . GSK2315698A ligand know bind serum amyloid protein ( SAP ) , key component anti-SAP approach treatment systemic amyloidosis . Safety assessment include adverse event , vital sign , ECGs relevant clinical laboratory test . Dose administration route also determine focus tolerability intravenous dose administration versus subcutaneous . The study aim recruit 30 patient medical diagnosis systemic amyloidosis . Subjects ask attend 2 dosing session , session involve intravenous infusion GSK2315698A 48 hour follow single subcutaneous dose session 1 3 subcutaneous dos session 2 administer 24 hour period .</detailed_description>
