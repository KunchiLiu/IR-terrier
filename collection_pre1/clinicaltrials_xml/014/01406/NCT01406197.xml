	<brief_summary>This study examine effect various formulation progesterone uterine electromyographic ( EMG ) activity pregnant patient premature labor determine progesterone suppress uterine electrical activity formulation may best inhibition uterine activity . Patients monitor prior treatment follow treatment ( every 2 4 hour ) one three different formulation progesterone two day . Patients continue observe deliver . Comparisons uterine EMG activity treatment follow treatment 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 48 hour time delivery treatment ( hour day follow treatment ) . Comparisons mean value EMG activity various treatment various time also make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study investigator compare effect vaginal progesterone , intramuscular apply progesterone topical progesterone uterine electromyographic activity ( EMG ) patient preterm labor . Electrodes place abdominal surface pregnant patient preterm labor EMG activity record 30 minute follow treatment 48 hour . In addition data delivery time record patient delivery vaginally Cesarian section . Eligibility criterion : Healthy patient without infection rupture membranes gestational age 24 34 week . Outcome measure : Comparisons uterine EMG activity ( EMG amplitude , frequency , specific information EMG burst ) measurement treatment follow treatment progesterone preparation various time ( 2,4,8 , 12,24 48 hour follow treatment ) delivery time patient various treatment ( hour day follow treatment , average delivery time patient treat various formulation ) . Comparisons mean value uterine EMG activity ( EMG amplitude , burst frequency frequency signal burst , power spectrum analysis burst peak power density spectrum burst ) treatment follow treatment 2 24 hour compare . Also time delivery follow treatment obtain average time delivery follow various treatment compare .</detailed_description>
