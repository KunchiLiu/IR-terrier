	<brief_summary>Haemophilus influenzae important pathogen cause primary infection respiratory viral infection infant lead secondary infection . The infection haemophilus major cause morbidity mortality infant child . At present , develop conjugant Hib vaccine prove safe effective , 90-99 % child produce antibody protection 3 dos . Because Hib vaccine prevent meningitis , pneumonia , epiglottis inflammation serious infection cause Hib bacteria , WHO suggest Hib vaccine include infant 's normal immune programming . Since use meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine , incidence disease recent year decline maintain level 0.5 per 1/100 thousand . But meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine relatively poor immune response infant age two , remain 60 % low antibody level short duration . According present immunization schedule , reach median level antibody level least 4 dos need . So meaningful improve vaccine immunogenicity , provide high level long-term protection reduce number injection . The objective study evaluate safety group A , C polysaccharide meningococcal type b haemophilus Influenzal Conjugate vaccine .</brief_summary>
