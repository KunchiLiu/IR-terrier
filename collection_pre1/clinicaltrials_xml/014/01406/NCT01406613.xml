	<brief_summary>This 2year observational study recruit patient previously complete randomise , open label , parallel , single centre study ( TRIO Study ) three bisphosphonates : alendronate , ibandronate risedronate . These drug commonly use group treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis UK . However , length time treatment continue work stop fully elucidate . Without information unclear long doctor treat whether would good practice give drug 'holidays ' . The investigator plan compare effect bone quantity quality stop license bisphosphonates patient take medication duration two year . The investigator aim recruit 100 postmenopausal 100 premenopausal ( reference range ) subject . Measurements collect final visit previous study use 'baseline ' value study . The postmenopausal group initial study visit secure inform consent , study visit 24 , 48 , 72 96 week stop medication . Visit procedures include : Blood urine sample measurement bone biomarkers Bone Mineral Density spine , hip , whole body , forearm Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , heel dual X-ray Laser ( DXL ) Quantitative Ultrasound Bone ( QUS ) Vertebral Fracture Assessment ( VFA ) . The premenopausal group one study visit , 96 week complete previous study . Visit procedures include : Blood urine sample measurement bone biomarkers Bone Mineral Density spine hip ( DXA ) A subgroup 50 premenopausal woman also follow measurement : Bone Mineral Density whole body , forearm ( DXA ) , heel ( DXL ) Quantitative Ultrasound Bone ( QUS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study observational study aim compare effect stop medication bone quantity quality , patient previously take bisphosphonate drug duration two year . This study recruit participant previously complete TRIO study . The TRIO study aim compare effect three license bisphosphonates bone quantity quality . Participants treatment group TRIO study randomise treatment one three license bisphosphonates ( alendronate , ibandronate risedronate ) duration two year . Measurements take final TRIO study visit use 'baseline ' value study . The postmenopausal group inform consent visit , follow study visit 24 , 48 , 72 96 week stop medication . Study visit procedure postmenopausal group include : Blood urine sample measurement bone biomarkers 24 , 48 , 72 96 week treatment . This study recruit participant previously complete TRIO study . The TRIO study aim compare effect three license bisphosphonates bone quantity quality . Participants treatment group TRIO study randomise treatment one three license bisphosphonates ( alendronate , ibandronate risedronate ) duration two year . Measurements take final TRIO study visit use 'baseline ' value study . The postmenopausal group inform consent visit , follow study visit 24 , 48 , 72 96 week stop medication . Study visit procedure postmenopausal group include : Blood urine sample measurement bone biomarkers 24 , 48 , 72 96 week treatment Height weight 48 96 week treatment . Bone Mineral Density whole body , spine , hip , forearm ( DXA ) heel ( DXL ) 48 96 week treatment Vertebral Fracture Assessment ( VFA ) 48 96 week treatment . Quantitative Ultrasound Bone ( QUS ) heel 48 96 week treatment . Participants give diary first study visit , record newly prescribe medication , hospitalisation , etc . The diary reviewed study visit record adverse event concomitant medication . Participants also ask complete standard Metabolic Bone Centre questionnaire first final study visit , change lifestyle capture . We maintain patient treatment calcium vitamin D supplement throughout study would consistent standard clinical practice . The TRIO study recruit group premenopausal woman order collect data act reference range physical measurement also act internal control study . This study plan recruit control participant continue act reference range study . The premenopausal group single study visit , schedule 96 week complete TRIO study . Study visit procedure premenopausal ( reference ) group include : Blood urine sample measurement bone biomarkers Urine base pregnancy test Height weight Bone Mineral Density hip spine ( DXA ) . A subgroup 50 premenopausal ( reference ) woman also follow : Bone Mineral Density whole body , forearm ( DXA ) heel ( DXL ) Quantitative Ultrasound Bone ( QUS ) heel Participants ask complete standard Metabolic Bone Centre questionnaire , change lifestyle capture . Participants also ask hospitalisation , newly prescribe medication , etc capture adverse event concomitant medication .</detailed_description>
