	<detailed_description>Genome wide association study ( GWAS ) identify 1000 disease associate SNPs , include many related cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Associations find traditional risk factor include lipid , blood pressure /hypertension , weight/body mass index , smoke behavior , diabetes . Importantly , GWAS also identify susceptibility variant coronary heart disease/ myocardial infarction ( CHD/MI ) , many independent traditional risk factor thus currently assess surrogate measure . The first , far strong , signal find 9p21.3 locus associate 20-40 % increase relative risk coronary heart disease among Caucasian East Asian population . Like association identify date , function non-coding 9p21.3 chromosomal region remain unclear . These marker predict disease modesty improve reclassification index . For instance , recent example , 13 SNPs previously identify GWAS associate CHD/MI incorporated multilocus model estimate association genetic risk score incident CHD/MI several large prospective study . Even adjust family history traditional risk factor , individual top quintile 1.66 time increase risk compare bottom quintile 36 . There significant improvement reclassification intermediate risk patient . The use marker yet show outperform model include traditional risk factor family history . This shortcoming probably vast majority heritable risk remain undiscovered . The basis heritability gap remain unclear focus intense investigation . Despite heritability gap , still possible use know genetic risk factor may improve patient outcome . For instance , genetic test improve patient adherence risk factor reduction Mendelian form coronary disease like familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) . However , `` garden variety '' coronary disease , never clinical trial indicate use genetic marker improve outcomes . There strong signal NIH , US Preventive Services Task Force independent prevention center genetic screen highly scrutinize trial exist . Currently , Evaluation Genomic Applications Practice Prevention ( EGAPP ) Working Group ACC/AHA Taskforce Practice Guidelines recommend genetic test coronary disease 39,40 clinical trial data support use . Despite recommendation , lack efficacy data , huge financial pressure increase genetic test `` direct-to-consumer '' company . In context , perfect opportunity develop well-designed clinical trial test variant .</detailed_description>
