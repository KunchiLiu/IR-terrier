	<criteria>All Study Participants A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Adults 18 75 year age time Screening . A female subject eligible participate childbearing potential , must agree use one contraception method describe protocol . This criterion must follow time Screening completion Followup Visit . OR Nonchildbearing potential define protocol . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose investigational product completion Followup visit . Satisfactory medical evaluation base upon medical history , medication history , physical examination , clinical laboratory data obtain screen visit . Body weight ≥ 45 kg ≤ 140 kg screening . For Stage 5 subject , body weight dry weight hemodialysis . QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; OR QTcF &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . These base average triplicate value obtain brief recording period screen Predose Day 1 . Vitamin B12 folate low limit normal screening . The subject mentally legally able comply requirement restriction protocol provide sign informed consent prior participation protocolspecific procedure , include screening procedure . Additional Inclusion Criteria Subjects Normal Renal Function Has normal creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) via CockcroftGault equation , use serum creatinine demographic data , obtain Screening . Normal subject great trace blood protein Screening urinalysis . A hemoglobin value screen great low limit reference range local laboratory less equal 16.0g/dL No great trace blood screen urinalysis Laboratory value specific criterion define within inclusion exclusion criterion study must within normal range deem clinically significant . A normal subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range may include investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure , integrity study . Additional Inclusion Criteria Subjects Renal Impairment Has Stage 3 Stage 4 renal function ( receive dialysis ) determine estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) calculate abbreviated MDRD equation OR Stage 5 renal function ( endstage renal failure ) stable hemodialysis treatment schedule three time weekly 3 month prior screen serum creatinine value Day 1 visit must within +/ 20 % screen value . Is otherwise consider clinically stable respect underlie renal impairment determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test ECG . clinical laboratory test result consider clinically stable opinion Investigator , especially clinical abnormality laboratory parameter deem associated subject 's underlying renal impairment . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Meets follow erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) criterion : The subject ESA naïve OR subject schedule ESA interval ≤ 7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least 7 day OR subject schedule ESA interval &gt; 7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least scheduled interval length ( e.g . discontinue ≥ 14 day schedule 14 day ESA interval ) AND subject resume ESA treatment completion Followup Visit . Has hemoglobin value : For ESA naïve subject : ≤11.0 g/dL subject receive ongoing ESA treatment : ≤12.0 g/dL screen check value ≤11.0 g/dL appropriate ESA discontinuation accord Inclusion criterion use ESAs prior commence investigational product dosing . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : All Study Participants A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result Screening . A positive test HIV antibody . Uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg Screening . A positive drug abuse alcohol screen . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study describe protocol . History regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month study excess 20 cigarette per day equivalent . History drug abuse dependence within 6 month study . History sensitivity investigational product , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . The subject participate clinical trial receive experimental investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( clinical research unit use heparin maintain intravenous cannula patency ) . History thrombosis define deep vein thrombosis , stroke , pulmonary embolism thrombosis relate condition within 1 year prior Screening . History myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome within 1 year prior Screening Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , and/or hepatic function could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion investigational product . Examples condition could interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility include cholecystectomy , gastrointestinal bypass surgery , partial total gastrectomy , small bowel resection , vagotomy , malabsorption , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac sprue . Examples condition could interfere hepatic function include Gilbert 's syndrome . Evidence active peptic , duodenal esophageal ulcer disease Screening . History chronic rectal bleeding . Subjects polycystic kidney disease . Subjects chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) . Subjects chronic lung disease require supplemental oxygen . Patients diagnosis pulmonary artery hypertension . Subjects Class III Class IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system . Postrenal transplantation subject function transplant . Note : Failed transplant subject back hemodialysis eligible participate study immunosuppressive medication past 3 month Screening . Active malignancy diagnosis malignancy within 5 year prior screen ( exclude successfully treat basal squamous cell carcinoma ) . History proliferative vascular eye disease ( e.g. , choroidal retinal disease , neovascular agerelated macular degeneration proliferative diabetic retinopathy wet macular edema ) base verbal confirmation ophthalmologic exam within 12 month screen . Pregnant female determine positive serum betahCG test Screening Day 1 . Lactating female . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Unwillingness inability follow procedure , lifestyle and/or dietary restriction outline informed consent direct site staff . Consumption red wine , grapefruit ( juice ) , blood orange ( juice ) , star fruit , onion , kale , broccoli , green bean , apple 7 day prior first dose investigational product , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Subject either immediate family member participate investigator , study coordinator , employee investigator ; member staff conduct study . Additional Exclusion Criteria Subjects Normal Renal Function The value hematological parameter screen outside reference range deem clinically significant Investigator GSK Medical Monitor . The value follow test screen : TIBC : outside reference range serum iron : outside reference range serum ferritin : outside reference range . Use plan use prescription nonprescription drug prohibit define protocol within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose investigational product completion followup visit unless opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Additional Exclusion Criteria Subjects Renal Impairment The value ferritin transferrin Screening renal impaired subject : transferrin saturation ≥ 20 % serum ferritin &lt; 100 μg/L Taking prohibited medication supplement ( exception approve vitamin mineral within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose investigational product completion followup visit , unless opinion Investigator sponsor medication interfere study . The following medication specifically prohibit screen followup visit : nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) immunosuppressant drug drug use treat malignancy .</criteria>
