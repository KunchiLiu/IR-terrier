Completely independent program implementation , random , representative subsample 549 family select conduct independent evaluation DC begin infant age 6 month ( initial interview complete infant age 6-8 month ) . Use random subsamples evaluation population-level intervention allow test intervention impact minimize evaluation cost ( e.g. , Moving Opportunity Fair Housing intervention15 ) . Consistent evaluation strategy , one family randomly select computer algorithm public birth record 549 day 18-month RCT enrollment period order examine program impact family enrol across entire trial period . Families select entire population eligible birth record ( i.e. , resident Durham County birth one two county birth hospital ) without consideration intervention participation adherence . Selected family decline participation replace randomly select family child birth date race/ethnicity original family , order preserve lack selection bias base characteristic . Selected family contact invited participate descriptive research study family community service use child development . Families blind study goal , home interviewer blind family DC participation status . Overall , 682 family randomly select 549 ( 81 % ) participate ( n=269 DC-eligible family ; n=280 control family ) . Post-hoc comparison hospital discharge record public birth record evaluation study consent interview complete identify 18 participate family subsequently declare ineligible due hospital discharge record error ( n=13 family hospital discharge record ; n=3 family child birth date discrepancy ; n=2 family address discrepancy affect Durham County residency ) , result final sample 664 select family 531 participate family . The ineligible family ( n=9 DC-eligible family ; n=9 control family ) remove without consideration intervention adherence evaluation outcome .</detailed_description>
