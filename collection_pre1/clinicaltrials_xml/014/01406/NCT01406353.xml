	<brief_summary>Although percutaneous mitral commissurotomy ( PMC ) accept effective treatment symptomatic patient moderate severe mitral stenosis ( MS ) , asymptomatic patient candidate PMC owe small inherent procedure-related risk . Asymptomatic patient MS show good survival rate 10 year , sudden deterioration precipitate atrial fibrillation embolism half patient . Because success rate PMC improve 95 % ideal patient highly select center early PMC may decrease occurrence adverse event , atrial fibrillation embolism , experience center tend perform PMC early stage disease . However , potential benefit early preemptive PMC asymptomatic patient balance real risk related procedure , study efficacy PMC prevention embolism necessary extend indication asymptomatic patient . To best knowledge , No randomize trial perform ascertain optimal time intervention asymptomatic patient significant MS . The early percutaneous MITral Intervention versus conventional manaGement Asymptomatic moderate miTral stEnosis ( MITIGATE ) trial design compare clinical outcome early intervention conventional management base current guideline asymptomatic moderate mitral stenosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We enroll consecutive asymptomatic patient moderate mitral stenosis candidate early percutaneous mitral commissurotomy ( PMC ) conventional treatment 3 center Seoul , Korea . Echocardiographic evaluation perform enrollment , immediately PMC annually follow-up . All patient undergo two-dimensional echocardiography and/or transesophageal echocardiography detect leave atrial thrombus . Morphologic feature mitral valve ( MV ) categorize describe previously ( 14 ) , total echocardiographic score obtain add score leaflet mobility , thickness , calcification , subvalvular lesion . The MVA measure direct planimetry mitral orifice , MS severity grade mild , moderate , severe MVA &gt; 1.5 , 1.0 1.5 , &lt; 1.0 cm2 , respectively . The severity mitral tricuspid regurgitation assess semiquantitatively use quantitative method classify mild , moderate , severe . Pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PAP ) estimate continuous wave Doppler simplify Bernoulli equation . All study patient regularly visit attend physician 3 monthly interval maintenance anticoagulation therapy every year annual re-evaluation . Patients conventional treatment group become symptomatic follow-up refer PMC mitral valve surgery . An embolic event define systemic embolism fulfil prespecified criterion : acute onset clinical symptom sign embolism occurrence new lesion confirm image study . A specific diagnosis cerebral infarction confirm experienced neurologist additional brain magnetic resonance imaging perform indicated . We estimate sample size 166 patient would provide 80 % power detect significant difference respect primary end point 2-sided significance level 0.05 , assume 3-year event rate 13 % conventional treatment group 2 % early PMC group , drop-out rate 5 % . These rate base result previous study . Analyses perform intention-to-treat basis . To analyze primary outcome , estimate cumulative event rate calculate Kaplan-Meier method compare employ log-rank test . For Kaplan-Meier analysis , analyze clinical event time first event . Hazard ratios 95 % confidence interval derive use Cox proportional hazard model .</detailed_description>
