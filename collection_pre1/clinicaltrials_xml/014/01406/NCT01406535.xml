	<brief_summary>The aim study prospectively investigate intermittent Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition 15 week improve myocardial perfusion angiogenesis patient therapy refractory myocardial ischemia due coronary artery disease judge unsuitable surgical percutaneous revascularisation . For proof efficacy follow test perform baseline one day 4 week discontinuation therapy : Exercise tolerance evaluate bicycle exercise test . Blood test perform evaluate marker angiogenesis ( endothelial progenitor cell , vascular endothelial growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor ) . The improvement myocardial perfusion test functionally increase coronary flow reserve positron emission tomography . Moreover , change ventricular function , symptom quality life assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design randomize , double-blind , placebo control monocentric study . Patients randomize two group ; PDE5 inhibitor ( vardenafil ) placebo take one tablet twice per day 15 week . The analysis perform blinded condition external expert direct contact investigator patient . Patients severe coronary artery disease judge unsuitable surgical revascularization bad general state health unsuitable percutaneous revascularization bad morphology coronary artery expert panel interventionists cardiac surgeon eligible study . Eligible patient meet inclusion criterion invite participation . At screen visit ( Visit -1 ) demographic data , medical history , concomitant medication document , vital sign check , physical examination , ECG , routine laboratory test perform . After give write informed consent participation study , patient randomize one two study group - PDE5 inhibitor ( vardenafil ) placebo take one pill twice per day 15 week . Within three week screen visit , baseline efficacy test perform . After last baseline test study medication distribute patient ( Visit 0 ) . During treatment phase follow-up visit schedule week 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 ( Visit 1-4 ) . Between week 13 15 efficacy test perform baseline repeat . The final visit last efficacy test terminates active study phase week 15 ( Visit 5 ) . During visit 0 5 clinical examination , ECG , clinical routine laboratory parameter ( blood chemistry , blood cell count , coagulation parameter ) patient perform . For proof efficacy follow test perform baseline one day 4 week discontinuation therapy : Exercise tolerance evaluate bicycle exercise test . Blood test perform evaluate marker angiogenesis ( endothelial progenitor cell , vascular endothelial growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor ) . The improvement myocardial perfusion test functionally increase coronary flow reserve positron emission tomography . Moreover , change ventricular function , symptom quality life assess . Endpoints study : Primary Endpoint : - Total exercise duration ( bicycle exercise test ) Secondary Endpoints : - Time 1mm ST-segment depression ( bicycle exercise test ) - Time limit angina ( bicycle exercise test ) - Myocardial blood flow ( PET ) - Left ventricular ejection fraction ( PET ) - Mean angina frequency per week - Score Seattle Angina Questionnaire - Natriuretic peptide</detailed_description>
