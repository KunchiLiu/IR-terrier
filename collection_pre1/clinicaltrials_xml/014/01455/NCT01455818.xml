	<brief_summary>Blood clot lung artery ( pulmonary embolism ) usually detect use radiological test call compute tomography ( CT scan ) . As technology advance , CT scan able detect small small blood clot . Over time , frequency blood clot pulmonary artery increase significantly ( CT scan detect small blood clot investigator could see ) . As result , people blood thinner treat small blood clot true clinical significance unknown . The management blood thinner costly also utilizes scarce healthcare resource . These blood thinner need monitor frequent blood work . Furthermore , every year , approximately 3 percent patient blood thinner major bleed event require medical attention . The investigator n't think treat small blood clot pulmonary artery detect CT scan worth risk bleed blood thinner . The main goal study find safe treat small blood clot pulmonary artery . The investigator plan follow 300 patient small blood clot lungs 90 day . These patient treat blood thinner follow closely non-invasive test avoid progression recurrence blood clot .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age great equal 18 year old . 2 . Patients newly diagnose isolate SSPE* ( number ) . Isolated SSPE define CTPA demonstrate intraluminal filling defect subsegmental artery filling defect visualize proximal pulmonary artery level . 1 . Proximal low extremity ( popliteal vein ) upper extremity ( subclavian vein ) DVT . 2 . Need long term oral anticoagulant therapy reason VTE . 3 . SSPE diagnose hospitalize patient ( &gt; 48 hour hospital admission ) . 4 . Requiring oxygen therapy maintain O2 saturation 92 % 5 . Previous history DVT ( proximal distal ) upper low extremity , PE , unusual site thrombosis ( e.g . splanchnic cerebral vein thrombosis ) . 6 . Geographically inaccessible followup 7 . Active Malignancy ( define basalcell squamous cell carcinoma skin ; cancer within past 6 month ; treatment cancer past 6 month ; recurrent metastatic cancer ) 8 . Pregnancy 9 . Have receive 48 hour therapeutic anticoagulation . Prophylactic dose allow required separate indication acceptable investigator . 10 . Unable/refuse sign inform consent 11 . Asymptomatic SSPE ( e.g . SSPE incidental finding CT scan conduct reason suspect PE )</criteria>
