	<brief_summary>Background : Prostate biopsy usually perform due accidentally discover elevated prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination . Transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guide biopsy standard procedure , possibility precise documentation concern localization biopsy lack . Therefore , location might subject multiple negative biopsy . There grow confidence magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prostate gland identify significant , high-grade tumour , study show value perform MRI biopsy . Because image documentation lacking , possible know region actually biopsied conventional TRUS biopsy . MRI 3D ultrasound soft image fusion guide biopsy , new promise method ascertain region prostate gland biopsied , possible perform accurate target biopsy combine MRI . Aims study Compare biopsy result two group : 1 . To evaluate overall rate positive biopsy . 2 . To evaluate rate re-biopsies . 3 . To evaluate detection rate Gleason grade 4 5 tumour . 4 . To evaluate rate positive target biopsy . 5 . To evaluate rate positive random biopsy 6 . To compare targeted random biopsy group . 7 . To compare patient tolerance , time consumption cost two method . 8 . To evaluate diagnostic accuracy perform cytological imprint target biopsy . Material method : A prospective randomized study include 300 consecutive patient refer initial biopsy . The patient randomize conventional TRUS biopsy image fusion guide biopsy . All patient undergo minimum 12-core re-biopsy procedure . In addition target biopsy obtain case positive MRI ultrasound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biopsy Study Comparing MRI Ultrasound Soft Image Fusion Guided Biopsies Gold Standard Prostate Biopsies .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biopsy procedures 1 . Conventional TRUS biopsy procedure ( Gold standard ) . These patient first undergo 0-6 TRUS target biopsy ( TRUS TB ) ( 2 target biopsy 3 lesion ) , direct towards lesion suspect prostate cancer see TRUS , detect DRE ( standard-target ) . Subsequently , undergo standard random 12 core TRUS guide biopsy procedure . All biopsy perform use Bruel Kjaer ultrasound unit , type 1846 , transrectal transducer No 8531 ( New york , United States ) . If reason would desirable reduce total number biopsy , omit random biopsy target biopsy already take specific site . Two dedicated urologist , ( L. M. E. G. M. ) , special interest experience prostate cancer perform conventional TRUS biopsy accord protocol , accord previous experience . No effort do two urologist harmonize biopsy procedure . 2 . 3D image document biopsy ( 3D IDB ) procedure . These patient first undergo MRI examination prostate . Possible cancer-suspect area identify map 3D . MRI finding high grade cancer suspicion mark red circle diameter 6 8 mm . MRI find compatible low intermediate cancer suspicion label yellow circle 6 8 mm diameter . The circle place centre MRI finding . A day later patient first undergo 0-6 targeted biopsy , direct towards possible lesion detect MRI , transfer ( soft image fusion ) TRUS image , allow TRUS biopsy direct towards lesion detect MRI , so-called MRI target biopsy ( MRI TB ) . These biopsy use additional cytological imprint evaluation presence/absence carcinoma . Subsequently , undergo 12 core random TRUS guide biopsy procedure , use 3D IDB software 3D TRUS equipment ( 3D IDB random ) . When perform random biopsy , MRI find display US screen . One dedicated urologist ( E . B . ) substantial experience 3D IDB procedure perform MRI TB . Biopsy procedure perform local anaesthesia use 6-10 ml 2 % Lidocaine . Using ultrasound control , local anaesthetic inject around prostate use 22-gauge spinal needle . Prostate volume calculate use standard ellipsoid formula , multiply large anterioposterior ( height ) , transverse ( width ) cephalocaudal ( length ) prostate diameter 0,524 . Biopsies perform use 18 gauge spring-loaded needle ( Angiotech® ) . All individual biopsy core mark kept separate glass fixation . Biopsy time define time TRUS probe place register group . MRI examination Patients randomize 3D IDB procedure MRI US fusion , undergo examination prostate use 1,5 T MR scanner ( Siemens Avanto , Erlangen Germany ) body array coil . Total scan time approximately 12 minute . Siemens Picture Archive Communicating System ( PACS ) Nordic ICE® use post processing analysis . Evaluation MRI examination perform one radiologist ( E. R. ) . Patient preparation Warfarin anticoagulant therapy stop 3 day biopsy procedure biopsy perform international normalized ratio ( INR ) value 2,0 . If need , low molecular weight heparin administer patient . A cleanse enema strictly require . One hour biopsy procedure plan peroral antibiotic ( Trimethoprim 160 mg , Sulfamethoxazole 800 mg ) administer additional dose take follow evening . Assessment patient tolerance discomfort register group visual analogue score ( VAS ) pain score questionnaire ( 10 score denote bad 0 denote bother ) . Cytological procedure Each target biopsy subject cytological imprint . These smear undergo standard stain classified positive negative accord presence carcinoma . Histopathological procedure Routine hematoxylin eosin ( HE ) stain biopsy perform , evaluate accord Gleason system ( gold standard histological evaluation ) range 1-5 , 5 aggressive tumour . Gleason score sum two dominate Gleason grade , instance 5+5 aggressive tumour give Gleason score 10 . The biopsy mark , order evaluate spatial distribution cancer . The length biopsy core tumour involvement measure . Null hypotheses 1 . There difference overall prostate cancer detection ( rate positive biopsy ) group undergo conventional TRUS biopsy procedure group undergo 3D IDB MRI TB . 2 . There high rate Gleason grade 4 5 3D IDB MRI TB group compare conventional TRUS group . 3 . The 3D IDB MRI TB group prostate cancer random 3D IDB 4 . The MRI TB detect prostate cancer TRUS TB . 5 . Random 3D IDB detect prostate cancer TRUS random biopsy . 6 . The rate re-biopsies equal two group . 7 . There correlation cytological histological result .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Patients without previous biopsy . Men age &lt; 75 year , clinically relevant decide whether prostate cancer . PSA &gt; 3 4 ng/ml &lt; 20 ng/ml . Suspicious finding DRE TRUS . Informed consent . Exclusion criteria Patients refuse sign consent form reason accept study premise . Patients want withdraw reason study . Patients contraindication MRI ( pacemaker , claustrophobia etc . ) Patients already undergone high quality MRI examination prostate within last year . In situation MRI examination evaluate together surgeon radiologist individual basis . In case low quality examination , disregard finding , include patient .
