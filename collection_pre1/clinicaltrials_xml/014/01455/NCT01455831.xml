	<brief_summary>The human body natural stress response surgery , include formation blood clot . This response surgery show increase metastasis ( spread cancer cell organs body ) . These metastasis see time surgery grow new tumor , cancer recur ( come back ) . A blood thinner call `` low molecular weight heparin '' ( LMWH ) suppress development metastases surgery animal experiment . The investigator want see give patient colorectal cancer blood thinner , LMWH , around time surgery decrease chance cancer spread organ ( metastasis ) come back ( recurrence ) . The investigator need 1075 patient answer scientific question . Patients give informed consent randomly put one two group , experimental group control group . The patient control group treat LMWH start hour surgery every day leave hospital . This patient treat colon cancer surgery ( standard care ) . The patient experimental group treat LMWH long period time , start day agree surgery continue two month surgery . All patient follow least three year surgery find cancer recur ( come back ) . If LMWH treatment around time surgery reduces chance recurrence patient colorectal cancer , would improve health quality life patient .</brief_summary>
