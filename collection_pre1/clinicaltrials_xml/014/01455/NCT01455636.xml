	<brief_summary>Low birth weight ( LBW ) infants particularly vulnerable frequent infection consequent morbidity result sub-optimal breastfeeding , limited ingestion complementary food ultimately micronutrient deficiency result post-natal linear growth faltering . The objective study facilitate improve feeding practice early reduction infection use innovative tool water-based hand sanitizer ( begin birth ) improve micronutrient powder ( I-MNP ) ( begin 6 month age ) . A community-based cluster randomize control trial carry Bangladesh use 2x2 factorial design . LBW infant ( n=480 ) recruit birth allocate either HS No HS 0 6 month . From 6 12 month , half child group randomize receive I-MNP . All group receive nutrition hygiene education birth 12 month . Recumbent length primary outcome ; morbidity , dietary intake hemoglobin assess secondary outcome . By work BRAC , large implementation agency Bangladesh , opportunity translate result directly quickly child health program Bangladesh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Linear Growth Faltering Among Low Birth Weight Infants Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Objective To explore relative effect hand sanitizer home fortification improve MNP ( plus nutrition education ) prevent infection , improve feed ultimately improve growth among LBW infant Bangladesh . Specific Objectives Although applicant clearly understand primary purpose Alive Thrive RFP improve infant feeding , believe prevent infection , feed improve growth accelerate . Thus primary objective determine relative effect intervention package improve feed thus prevent reverse linear growth falter reduce rate stunt among LBW infant ( Ha : Combination three intervention improve feed prevent reverse linear growth falter reduce rate stunt ) Secondary objective ( ) Investigate effect intervention package rate diarrhea acute respiratory tract infection ( ARI ) . ( Ha : Combination three intervention reduce rate diarrhea acute respiratory tract infection ) ( ii ) Explore effect intervention package energy nutrient intakes infant feed behavior . ( Ha : Combination three intervention increase energy nutrient intake infant improve feed behavior ) ( iii ) Determine impact improve MNP iron status ( hemoglobin level blood ) subgroup . ( Ha : The group receive improve MNP increase hemoglobin level blood reduce rate anemia )</detailed_description>
