	<brief_summary>This single institution study combine decitabine fludarabine busulfan set allogeneic stem cell transplantation . A study population 20 subject enrol The John Theurer Cancer Center Hackensack University Medical Center . Subjects eligible receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation accord eligibility criterion consent enrol . Subjects receive treatment decitabine follow reduced intensity fludarabine busulfan prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Subjects follow 1 year post transplantation ass stability engraftment , toxicity , progression free survival , disease response</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aberrant DNA methylation pattern commonly find malignant cell . Hypermethylation gene promotes sequence cancer cell result transcriptional silencing tumor suppressor gene contribute malignant transformation . Hypomethylating agent explore treatment cancer acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome . In vitro inhibition methylation use azanucleosides result differentiation transform myeloid cell . In vivo agent induce DNA methylation malignant myeloid cell . The potent DNA methylating agent currently available , decitabine , effective patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . About 30 % patient MDS abnormal karyotype normalization karyotype receive drug . The myelodysplastic syndrome heterogeneous group clonal hematologic disorder characterize bone marrow failure proliferation myeloblastic leukemia cell . Patients MDS develop cytopenias result ineffective hematopoiesis . These cytopenia believe result increase apoptosis result increase futile cell cycling . In addition , apparently mature differentiate hematopoietic cell patient MDS functionally impair . Granulocytes decrease myeloperoxidase activity platelet impaired function . Therapy MDS include supportive care gear mostly transfusional support . Allogeneic transplantation show offer possibility long-term remission remain curative option patient MDS . The development reduce intensity conditioning regimen expand scope allogeneic transplantation older patient MDS . A large retrospective analysis European Blood Marrow Transplantation Group compare outcome 836 patient MDS treat either reduced-intensity condition regimen conventional regimen allogeneic transplantation . The 3-year probability progression-free overall survival similar group , 3-year relapse rate significantly high reduced-conditioning group , offset significantly reduce probability non-relapse mortality . This demonstrate importance preparative regimen prevent relapse setting . Acute myeloid leukemia account 9,000 death yearly United States . The WHO classification AML incorporate interrelated morphology , cytogenetics , molecular genetics immunologic marker attempt construct classification clinically prognostically valid . Under classification requisite blast percentage marrow &gt; 20 % . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation establish therapeutic modality patient AML . An alloreactive immunotherapeutic effect donor cell demonstrate . No established therapy apply complete remission offer strong anti-leukemic effect . Transplant-related morbidity mortality , however , remain obstacle successful application treatment . More recently , reduced-intensity conditioning apply therapy AML . Reduced-intensity conditioning , include potent immunosuppressive agent addition anti-leukemic agent , effectively permit engraftment donor hematopoietic stem cell . Several study demonstrate morbidity mortality less regimen compare myeloablative conditioning . While reduced intensity condition regimen result reduced non-relapse mortality patient AML , study suggest concomitant increase relapse consequence lower intensity cytotoxic agent . New condition regimen may increase anti-leukemic effect maintain reduced-intensity regimen toxicity profile therefore , need . Decitabine deoxycytidine analog rapidly enter cell nucleoside-specific transport mechanism . It phosphorylated deoxycytidine kinase convert active triphosphate form , 5AZA-dCTP , substrate DNA polymerase alpha . 5AZA-dCTP incorporated DNA inhibits DNA methylation inactivate DNA methyltransferase . Decitabine s-phase specific . A recent study randomize 170 patient MDS receive either decitabine best supportive care . Patients treat decitabine achieve significantly high overall response rate ( 17 % ) include complete response ( 9 % ) , compare supportive care ( 0 % ) . Responses durable associate transfusion independence . Patients treat decitabine trend toward long median time acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) progression death compare patient receive supportive care alone . Responses AML also demonstrate 14 % complete responses 8 % partial responses one study . Decitabine use combination cyclophosphamide busulfan preparative regimen patient AML . This regimen associate high response rate , 40 % patient AML still remission three year transplantation . The total dose decitabine range 400 mg/m2 800 mg/m2 . No decitabine dose-limiting toxicity document . The combination fludarabine busulfan well establish transplant regimen associate reduce regimen-related toxicity . The combination fludarabine busulfan current standard care AML patient undergo allogeneic transplantation HUMC . In study investigator use combination reduced-intensity fludarabine busulfan along decitabine 300 mg/m2 .</detailed_description>
