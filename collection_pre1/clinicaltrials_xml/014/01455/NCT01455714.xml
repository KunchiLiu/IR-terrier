	<brief_summary>Finding early predictor myocardial patient hypertension 1 . Scientific objective The study objective clarify ground heart exertional dyspnoea stenocardial pain patient well-controlled stage I II hypertension accord ESH ( European Society Hypertension ) , without change epicardial coronary artery coronary angiography normal rest echocardiography result , assess potential early marker heart hypertrophy failure patient hypertension . Characteristics final result The study allow identification patient hypertension , early introduction pharmacological treatment heart failure consider . Evaluation detection asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction include potential heart failure marker : cardiotrophin 1 , cystatin C , serum syndecan-4 , collagen III N-terminal propetide [ PIIINP ] , MMP-2 , MMP-7 , MMP-8 , MMP-9 NT-proBNP , modern echocardiography method magnetic resonance image order increase effectiveness prevention , diagnosis treatment optimalization . 2 . Project significance Prognosis heart failure serious . It similar worse advanced cancer . These data indicate extreme importance optimal early causal treatment hypertension symptomatic treatment heart failure early stage order prevent development advance form disease , bad prognosis . In clinical practice , patient well-controlled hypertension often report exercise limitation , exertional dyspnea and/or stenocardial pain reflect standard rest echocardiography ( normal result ) , without coronary artery disease data electrocardiographic stress test without change epicardial coronary vessel coronary angiography . The study design establish panel diagnostic test patient hypertension exertional dyspnoea , allow early detection abnormality ( symptom occur ) start optimal treatment patient . Unfortunately , still small percentage patient receive full pharmacotherapy , hence author late guideline procedure heart failure hypertension put great emphasis aspect . Optimal management may prevent progression patient stage C heart failure , thus bring tangible benefit patient also , reduce number costly hospitalization , significantly reduce health care cost . The number hospitalization heart failure Poland estimate 100 000 per year , hospitalization cost exceed 70 % total cost associate treatment heart failure . The issue exertional dyspnoea overt heart failure patient hypertension normal result rest echocardiography new problem , Poland world . So far , treatment recommendation group patient . Material study plan 120 person ( age 40-60 year old ) include study , patient stage I II primary hypertension accord European Society Hypertension : Group A- 40 patient without symptom heart failure Group B- 40 patient exertional dyspnoea Group C - 40 patient overt heart failure In group B ( patient exertional dyspnea/stenocardia ) include patient undergone contrast coronary angiography without identify change epicardial coronary artery , facilitate answer present purpose research . Patients group A B normal rest echocardiography treat maximum 2 antihypertensive drug ( ACE inhibitor sartan therapy base ) , accord follow regimen : ACEI/ARB + diuretic ACEI/ARB + calcium channel antagonist Group C - treatment accordance standard heart failure . Each patient inform objective study give write consent participate . After sign informed consent patient perform follow test : - Interview documentation analysis , - Physical examination , - Electrocardiogram , - 24-hour blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) , - 24-hour EKG recording , - Echocardiography rest submaxinal exercise bicycle ergometer , - Flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) , - Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , - Standard labolatory parameter , - Levels marker : cystatin C , cardiotrophin-1 , metaloproteinases : MMP-2 , MMP-7 , MMP-8 , MMP-9 , Procollagen III N-Terminal Propeptide ( PIIINP ) , Syndecan 4 ( SDC4 ) NT-proBNP Each patient inform objective study give write consent participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The concept plan study 1 . The attempt clarify ground heart exertional dyspnoea stenocardial pain patient well-controlled stage I II hypertension accord ESH ( European Society Hypertension ) , without change epicardial coronary artery coronary angiography normal rest echocardiography . 2 . MRI evaluation coronary microcirculation endothelial function assess flow-dependent vasodilation hypertensive patient without heart failure symptom . 3 . Comparison modern echocardiographic method magnetic resonance image diagnosis hypertensive patient without overt heart failure . 4 . Cystatin C new marker organ damage patient hypertension comparison cystatin C GFR assess MDRD Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance renal function assessment indicator patient hypertension . 5 . Evaluation new marker - cardiotrophin 1 cystatin C , serum syndecan-4 , collagen III N-terminal propetide [ PIIINP ] , MMP-2 , MMP-7 , MMP-8 , MMP-9 NT-proBNP early diagnosis heart failure . 6 . Potential marker heart failure , modern echocardiography method magnetic resonance image detection asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction order increase effectiveness prevention treatment . 7 . Searching relationship type hypertension ( dipper non-dipper ) development heart failure symptom , whether difference echocardiographic image patient ? 8 . Selection patient hypertension , early introduction pharmacological treatment heart failure consider . 9 . The study also help answer following question : ( ) Which parameters best ass overall cardiovascular risk ? ( b ) When treatment heart failure patient hypertension start . The measurable effect research besides cognitive possibility reduce proportion patient come overt heart failure connect hypertension optimization preventive , diagnostic method determine optimum treatment patient .</detailed_description>
