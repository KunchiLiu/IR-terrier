	<detailed_description>Mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common type brain injury . Post-mild TBI disability could stem cognitive , physical , psychological social dysfunction result significant disability unemployment . Cognitive impairment post traumatic brain injury due disruption brain vascular bed microstructural damage . Currently , specific therapy individual mild TBI . Neuropsychological assessment early management immediately mild traumatic brain injury show reduce long term cognitive disability . In-vitro in-vivo study show well recovery cognitive function administration exogenous lactate traumatic brain injury . The role lactate cerebral energy metabolism investigate widely . The ability lactate sole energy substrate support synaptic function demonstrate different study . In many study , lactate proven prefer even obligatory substrate glucose aerobic energy production initial stage recovery cerebral ischemia hypoxia recovery ATP-depleted synaptic function exogenously supply lactate support early recovery synaptic function hypoxia . However , clinical study evaluate effect lactate administration cognitive function patient mild traumatic brain injury still limit . Therefore , conduct study evaluate effect exogenous lactate infusion contain hyperosmolar sodium lactate solution cognitive function assess Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score evolution mild traumatic brain injury compare patient receive hyperosmolar sodium chloride 3 % control group . MMSE score use tool describe cognitive function .</detailed_description>
