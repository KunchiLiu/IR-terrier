	<brief_summary>Lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) , common disorder narrow spinal canal lower part back . This cause discomfort leg stand walking pressure spinal nerves.There several treatment option LSS include physiotherapy , lumbar surgical decompression procedure laminectomy , Foraminotomy , Discectomy recently device interspinous distraction XSTOP® May 2011 Minuteman™ . Surgical decompression LSS involve removal excess bone , ligament , soft-tissue allow room nerve . The operation usually preform general anaesthetic average stay hospital 2-3 night . Whereas Minuteman™ implant preform day case local general anaesthetic involves implant device space two back bone relieve pressure nerve , therefore , pain leg . This multi centre ( four site ) randomise control trial total sample 50 participant obtain informed consent . Participants attend pain clinic Hospitals baseline visit randomise ratio 1:1 receive either Minuteman™ Interspinous interlaminar fusion Implant standard surgical decompression treatment lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) . Following randomisation arrangement make participant receive randomise treatment . If allocate Minuteman™ Implant , treatment conduct Pain Specialist identify site . If allocate surgical decompression , treatment conduct neuro/spinal-surgeon identified site . Participates follow regularly 60 month post implant ass clinical efficacy , safety , participant function quality life treatment .</brief_summary>
