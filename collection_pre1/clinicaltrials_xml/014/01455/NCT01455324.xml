	<brief_summary>The purpose study work prosthetist fit novel conformable socket material develop Infoscitex , subject , determine viable alternative current prosthetic socket liner . During task , research team travel prosthetist location fit subject conformable woven socket check socket , provide subjective feedback regard comfort fit amputee , ease use , breathability . The subject also wear woven socket gait analysis provide his/her feedback well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Modern prosthetics improve significantly regard control functionality , fit residual limb within prosthetic socket primary concern many amputee . A poor fit lead skin irritation , tissue breakdown , pain . The volume residual limb amputee change throughout course day throughout year . Volume fluctuation within socket lead issue amputee , include decrease comfort , increase shear force , increased pressure bony prominence , well poor gait pattern . An uncomfortable non-performing socket/residual limb interface decrease user compliance prosthetic therefore decrease activity level amputee want remain active civilian military life . The investigator develop multilayered socket take advantage novel braid material strength passive conformability thin layer dedicate wearer comfort . This new socket provide ultimate fit improvement performance prosthesis . The socket adapt change physical shape residual limb prosthesis worn . The adaptation natural result material property , do passively real time . The material lightweight , breathable , ultrasound transparent , allow prosthetic function variety environment . This study undertaken prosthetist fit subject low limb amputee weave inner socket , check socket evaluation gait lab set . At completion , subject prosthetist ask complete questionnaire give opinion regard material woven inner socket .</detailed_description>
