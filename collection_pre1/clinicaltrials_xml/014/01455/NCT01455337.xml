	<brief_summary>Alcoholic hepatitis represent one serious form alcoholic liver disease . Critically ill patient alcoholic hepatitis high morbidity mortality rate . Because data suggest pathogenic mechanism alcoholic hepatitis involve cytokine release perpetuation injury immunologic process , corticosteroid extensively evaluate treatment alcoholic hepatitis . Although discrepancy literature several randomized trial meta-analyses reach contradictory result , corticosteroid subset patient severe alcoholic hepatitis , define discriminant function ≥ 32 , also concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding , active infection , renal failure , pancreatitis , recommend . This latter point emphasize important meticulous selection avoid side effect corticosteroid . Thus , beneficial effect seem confine highly select minority group inhibitory effect corticosteroid liver inflammation outweigh side effect weaken defense infection , anti-anabolic effect , possible ulcer-promoting effect cause gastrointestinal bleeding , may deleterious critically ill patient . Newer understanding role role TNF-α expression receptor activity alcoholic liver injury prompt examination TNF inhibition alternative corticosteroid severe alcoholic hepatitis . Pentoxifylline , nonspecific TNF inhibitor , recently demonstrate randomized trial improve survival therapy severe alcoholic hepatitis . In particular , survival benefit pentoxifylline appear related significant reduction development hepatorenal syndrome . These result promising , support need evaluate potential new therapeutic avenue . There need head head comparison corticosteroid pentoxifylline severe alcoholic hepatitis . At time current study design ( 2008 ) , corticosteroid first-line treatment severe alcoholic hepatitis . This study design demonstrate effect pentoxifylline similar ( i.e. , inferior ) prednisolone , active form prednisone . The aim present study thus compare effect pentoxifylline prednisolone short-term mortality .</brief_summary>
