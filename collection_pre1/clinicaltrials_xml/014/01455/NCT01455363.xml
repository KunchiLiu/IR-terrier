	<brief_summary>The investigator aim test hypothesis proof thank laser speckle contrast image post-occlusive reactive hyperemia ( PORH ) induce tumor , case , basal cell carcinoma , use model study tumor vasculature . This new concept tumor perfusion artificial increase could use future malignant tumor treatment , order increase tumor mean oxygen partial pressure ( thus decrease tumor hypoxia , hallmark malignant tumor ) cancerology therapy , like radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy , increase efficacy . This clinical trial use skin flap model trunk facial basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , respect classical excision margin BCC surgery ( 3-4mm ) : local anesthesia , little random pattern skin flap raise around BCC , cutaneous pedicle clamp surgical clamp 3 minute clamp release . In case limb BCC , limb tourniquet use , occlude 3 minute upstream BCC location . During step experimentation , laser speckle image use measure continuously peri-tumoral tumoral perfusion , start tumor excision , to10 minute tumor pedicle clamp tourniquet release .</brief_summary>
