	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To assess safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) iniparib single agent combination chemotherapeutic regimens patient advance solid tumor refractory standard therapy . Secondary Objectives : - To assess antitumor effect iniparib ( per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) Version 1.1 patient measurable disease . - To characterize iniparib ( metabolite , possible ) pharmacokinetics . Based data generate Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
