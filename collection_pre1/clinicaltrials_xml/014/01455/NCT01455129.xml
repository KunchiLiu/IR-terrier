	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one common respiratory disease . During early stage COPD , patient mild respiratory symptom sign may lead under-diagnosis disease . Patients may show poor response treatment later stag disease , associate high mortality incidence re-hospitalization disability cause burden family society . So far , large-scale clinical trial long-term intervention tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva ) patient early stage COPD ( i.e . GOLD Stage I-II COPD asymptomatic COPD ) . It would great significance COPD prevention treatment investigator could prove tiotropium decrease lung function decline reverse disease progression patient early-stage COPD . The investigator objective evaluate efficacy long-term intervention tiotropium early stage ( FEV1 ≥50 % predict ) COPD ( difference trough FEV1 , number exacerbation , time first exacerbation , quality life , etc ) relevant pharmacoeconomic endpoint .</brief_summary>
