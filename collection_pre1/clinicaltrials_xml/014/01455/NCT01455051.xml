	<brief_summary>A good proportion patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) manage effectively palliative chemotherapy . However , group young patient poor risk disease whose life expectancy significantly reduce . As result , reduce intensity conditioning ( RIC ) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT ) investigate potentially curative procedure . Recently , European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) publish set guideline suggest situation allo-HCT might consider therapeutic option CLL patient . Their conclusion allo-HCT reasonable young CLL patient refractory fludarabine , relapse within two year intensive treatment , p53 abnormality require treatment . However , result RIC allo-HCT entirely satisfactory , progression-free survival allo-HCT revolves around 35-40 % 3-5 year follow allo-HCT . This due non-relapse mortality , significantly associate development graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , also due disease relapse . These relapse may occur early course transplantation , like hematological malignancy , late relapse also report . Several strategy test order improve result . The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab , give concomitantly allo-HCT donor lymphocyte infusion , may reduce graft-versus-host disease facilitate disease control . This may due , direct cytotoxicity , also modulation GVHD graft-versus CLL effect ( GVCLL ) . Interestingly , rituximab show promote cross-presentation tumor-derived peptide antigen-presenting cell , thus enhance formation cytotoxic T-cell clone GVCLL effect . With addition rituximab condition regimen , rate 4 year current progression-free survival ( CPFS ) overall survival 44 % 48 % . The investigator hypothesize ofatumumab , potent anti-CLL activity complement-dependent cytoxicity rituximab , could improve disease control modulate GVCLL effect effectively , thus reduce GVHD rate subsequently improve non-relapse mortality progression-free survival long term .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose CD20+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia accord World Health Organization . 2 . Patients older 18 young 70 year old . 3 . Patients fail meet NCI Working Group criteria complete partial response therapy regimens contain fludarabine disease relapse within 12 month complete therapy fludarabine contain regimen . Patients eligible fludarabine treatment , could also include provided disease remain unresponsive relapse 12 month complete alternative salvage regimen ( i.e . autologous HCT , bendamustine , gemcitabine , alemtuzumab highdose methylprednisolone ) , OR Patients novo acquire `` 17p deletion '' cytogenetic abnormality . These patient must receive induction chemotherapy could transplant first complete partial response . 4 . Patients must achieve complete partial response last therapy give prior transplantation . Patients clinically suspect histologically confirm Richter 's transformation could include complete response time transplantation . 5 . Patients receive four line therapy prior transplantation . 6 . Patients suitable HLAmatched relate unrelated donor willing receive GCSF , undergo apheresis collect PBMC , donate stem cell . Patients singlelocus mismatch donor available also eligible . 7 .
