	<brief_summary>Septic shock critically ill patient condition associate high rate organ failure hereto attributable mortality ~45-55 % Hypothesis : Mild Induced Hypothermia reduce mortality critically ill patient septic shock reduce organ metabolism , counteract microcirculatory thrombosis , genetically downregulating tissue apoptosis reduce bacterial growth rate toxin production .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cooling And Surviving Septic Shock Study ( CASS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock acute life-threatening condition , great organ damage every hour . The patient high risk die therefore rapid treatment crucial importance survival patient . Septic shock mainly due collapse blood circulation ( capillary system ) due blockage blood cell - process initiated substance cell immune system via activation coagulation . The normal function small blood vessel transport oxygen , nutrient drug organ tissue , lead waste product away . While offer oxygen nutrient organs decrease , consumption oxygen nutrient increase due fever immune reaction . When capillary system collapse , organ tissue suffer , various form cell death organ begin include `` program cell death '' ( `` apoptosis '' ) . This lead organ damage , example brain damage kidney damage ultimately multiple organ dysfunction direct cause patient dy . Mild induce hypothermia ( cool 32 0C-34 0C ) affect least 5 core area pathophysiology septic shock : 1 ) inhibition inflammation 2 ) inhibition apoptosis ( `` program cell death '' ) , 3 ) antithrombotic , 4 ) decrease metabolism 5 ) inhibits bacterial growth production toxin .</detailed_description>
