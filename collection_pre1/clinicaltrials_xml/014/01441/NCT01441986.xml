	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) characterize hyperglycemia due impaired insulin activity ( insulin resistance ) reduce insulin production pancreas . The restoration adequate insulin secretion represent one goal several antidiabetic therapy sulfonylureas incretin mimetics . Lowering blood glucose type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) prevent complication , microvascular complication particular . Weight reduction also fundamental target treatment T2DM ; however , achieve weight loss lifestyle measure difficult , problem obesity often exacerbate therapy glucose-lowering agent insulin , cause weight gain . Pancreatic ß- cell part pancreatic islet , 1-2 million locate within human pancreas . Interestingly , pancreas function control part central nervous system ß- cell many feature common neuron , include expression tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) , neural guidance molecule , Eph receptor ephrins , neural cell adhesion molecule , N-Cadherin NCAM ( Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule ) , NMDA ( N-Methyl-D-Aspartate ) -type glutamate receptor . Thus , hypothesize drug available manipulate central nervous system ( CNS ) may also act pancreatic ß- cell may use T2DM MODY treatment . NMDA receptor represent key target drug several neuronal disease excitotoxicity contribute mechanism , Parkinson 's Alzheimer disease , well therapy CNS-controlled disease symptom , cough . Glutamate NMDA receptor transmembrane , excitatory cell surface receptor level CNS pancreatic islet . NMDA antagonists thus exert preponderantly antiexcitatory effect CNS decrease central activation adrenal gland . This potentially lead indirect effect pancreatic cell insulin secretion , even direct effect pancreatic ß-cells suggest antagonism pancreatic NMDA receptor .</detailed_description>
