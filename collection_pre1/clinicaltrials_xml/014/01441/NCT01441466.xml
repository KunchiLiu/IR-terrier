	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect cohort isolation RS ( respiratory syncytial virus ) -positive bronchiolitis versus RS-negative bronchiolitis prevention co-infection clinical disease severity . Furthermore investigator want elucidate general epidemiological data bronchiolitis concern viral cause associated clinical severity . The investigator want conduct prospective cohort study , compare incidence co-infection clinical severity , two cohort : one isolation RS positive bronchiolitis separate cohort within bronchiolitis one without isolation ( child RS-negative bronchiolitis nurse together independent viral agent )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute bronchiolitis major cause hospitalisation young child winter season . Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) frequently identify virus , however use new highly sensitive molecular amplification method , role viral pathogen bronchiolitis increasingly recognize . Various disease severity show range respiratory virus , double viral infection relatively common , occur 10-30 % hospitalised patient . There consensus , however , impact co-infection disease severity : Some study show severe disease co-infected child , others not.Most hospital perform routine viral test identify isolate RSV-infected infant , aim reduce risk nosocomial cross-infection patients.However , good evidence available effective approach prevent nosocomial cross-infections among admitted patient clinical diagnosis bronchiolitis . Because limited isolation facility , patient bronchiolitis admit pediatric ward initially share room , pending result virological diagnosis . We hypothesize contact isolation measure maintain enough distance bed share room sufficient prevent cross-infection , since major route transmission respiratory virus close contact infected secretion small-particle aerosol . Objectives The purpose study determine incidence cross-infection child hospitalise bronchiolitis , patient RSV share room patient bronchiolitis infect another virus first day admission . Study design The study conduct 30-bed pediatric ward . From December 2011 March 2012 , eligible infant young two year age hospitalise acute bronchiolitis prospectively enrol . Bronchiolitis define acute respiratory disease , accompany coryza , cough , inspiratory crackle and/or expiratory wheeze auscultation . Infants chronic lung disease , congenital heart disease Down 's syndrome exclude . We prospectively collect follow demographic clinical information , include presence number room mate , virological diagnosis patient room mate , daily dyspnoea score assess independent researcher , unaware virological diagnosis . A nasopharyngeal aspirate collect virological diagnosis direct immunochromatographic antigen detection immediately admission , every fourth day admission , five seven day discharge.All patient bronchiolitis treated standard hygienic measure . Medical nursing personnel wore gown , glove mask patient contact wash hand patient contact . Parents visitor ask wash hand leave room . On first day admission , pending result RSV-PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , patient share two- four-bed room , bed separate least 1,5 meter . Cohorting RSV-infected patient commence soon result RSV-PCR known , generally within one day admission . Statistical analysis Chi-square test use compare categorical data , Mann-Whitney U-tests continuous data skew distribution . Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 19 .</detailed_description>
