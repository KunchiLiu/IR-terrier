	<brief_title>The ORANGE II PLUS - Trial : Open Versus Laparoscopic Hemihepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver resection colorectal metastasis potentially curative therapy become standard care appropriately stag patient , offer 5-year survival rate approximately 35-40 % . Also symptomatic benign lesion uncertain nature large size , liver resection widely accept treatment . Open hepatectomy ( OH ) current standard care management primary secondary malignancy . Although feasibility laparoscopic hepatectomy ( LH ) establish , select centre use technique primary modality . Laparoscopic liver resection first report 1991 . Over last decade method gain wide acceptance various liver resection procedure . Multiple retrospective case series review compare open laparoscopic liver resection indicate laparoscopic liver resection apply safely malignant benign liver lesion . Laparoscopic liver resection associate short hospital length stay , reduce intraoperative blood loss , less postoperative pain , early recovery well quality life . Initially leave lateral segment liver choose anatomic laparoscopic resection good result . Many liver centre worldwide currently adopt laparoscopic surgery resection anterior segment , relatively low volume operate , significant learn curve lack evidence restrict majority liver surgeon adopt disseminate technique . Recently , indication resectability broaden new ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy ( radio ) embolisation technique . A new impulse laparoscopic management liver lesion come first report laparoscopic hemihepatectomies . Major hepatic resection technically demand hold increase risk morbidity . It demonstrate expert hand major anatomical laparoscopic liver resection feasible good efficacy safety . Expert liver center already perform laparoscopic ( extend ) hemihepatectomies . Currently , European center , median hospital length stay 6.0 13.1 3.5 10.0 day observe respectively open laparoscopic hepatic resection . In expert hand median duration admission major hepatic resection varies 6 - 12.5 open 4 - 8.2 laparoscopic surgery . However , report scarce level 1 evidence matter still present . Within framework optimise postoperative recovery , broad indication resection adoption laparoscopic liver surgery need randomize trial.Regarding postoperative care , enthusiasm arisen Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS® ) program . This multimodal program , derive Kehlet 's 1990 's pioneer work multimodal surgical care field , involve optimization several aspect perioperative management patient undergo major abdominal surgery . In patient undergoing segmental colectomy , ERAS® -program enable earlier recovery consequently short hospital length stay . Furthermore , reduction postoperative morbidity patient undergoing intestinal resection report . These result stimulate liver surgeon ERAS® group ( Maastricht , Edinburgh Tromsö ) adapt ERAS®-program patient undergo open liver resection . Van Dam et al . find significantly reduce hospital length stay open liver resection patient manage within multimodal ERAS®-program . Besides reduction median total hospital length stay 8 6 day ( 25 % ) , data also suggest reduction stay could possible delay recovery actual discharge patient . Moreover , Stoot et al . show - retrospectively - reduction length stay 7 day 5 day patient operate laparoscopically manage within ERAS®-program . In study also delay recovery actual discharge patient . Earlier , Maessen et al . report median delay discharge 2 day patient functionally recover colonic surgery manage within ERAS®-program . This delay often link social problem , problem homecare support logistic problem . The added value laparoscopic hemihepatectomy compare open hemihepatectomy never study randomize controlled setting . Therefore , multicenter international ORANGE II PLUS - trial construct provide evidence merit laparoscopic versus open hemihepatectomy .</detailed_description>
