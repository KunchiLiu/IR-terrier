	<brief_summary>Background : - Thyroid hormone produce thyroid gland , organ base neck . Thyroid hormone control body 's metabolism function many organ . The thyroid gland produce two form thyroid hormone : T4 T3 . People thyroid cancer treat thyroid hormone therapy ( synthetic T4 , levothyroxine ) , time need stop allow cancer treatment . At time , different form thyroid hormone ( synthetic T3 , liothyronine ) use reduce symptom cause low level thyroid hormone . Researchers want know change T3 hormone affect body organ function . Objectives : - To study change T3 hormone level affect body organ function . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age thyroid remove treat thyroid cancer need stop take regular thyroid hormone dose preparation treatment thyroid cancer . Design : - The study involve screen visit baseline evaluation . It also include 11-day inpatient hospital stay . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood test neck ultrasound . - Participants evaluate physical exam , blood test , follow procedure : - Glucose tolerance test measure blood sugar - Tests body fat , muscle strength , calorie burning level - Imaging study heart , liver , thigh muscle - Quality life questionnaires - Food preference diet questionnaires - After 4 week treatment T3 hormone , participant 11-day inpatient hospital stay study effect thyroid hormone metabolism . The stay involve test do baseline evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In human adult thyroid hormone action play critical role modulation metabolism function virtually organ/systems . The specificity hormonal action ultimately result interaction active hormone , triiodothyronine ( T3 ) , receptor isoforms co-activators co-repressors specific various cell target hormonal action . Circulating tissue level T3 result secretion T3 precursor , thyroxine ( T4 ) , thyroid gland , peripheral conversion T4 T3 , degradation hormone . This complex system partially study human little known regard kinetics T3 , particular correlation circulating level T3 end-organ target tissue thyroid hormone action . The aim protocol characterize pharmacokinetics T3 biological effect various concentration cohort thyroidectomized patient undergo thyroid hormone replacement therapy withdrawal management thyroid cancer . Sixteen patient clinical indication thyroid hormone withdrawal preparation 131I therapy 123I diagnostic scan follow-up management differentiate thyroid cancer recruit study . After enrollment study , patient baseline characteristic determine outpatient visit receive levothyroxine ( L-T4 ) therapy . The L-T4 therapy suspend substituted equivalent thrice daily liothyronine ( L-T3 ) therapy one month . Patients admit NIH Clinical Center day prior withdrawal T3 therapy diagnostic scan administration radioactive iodine . During hospitalization research protocol , expect last eleven day , follow study perform : serial blood sample circulate thyroid hormone obtain pharmacokinetic parameter L-T3 , lipid , glucose insulin , rest energy expenditure , echocardiogram , skeletal muscle strength measurement , cardiac , hepatic skeletal muscle MRI , quality life well-being questionnaire . The pharmacokinetic parameter L-T3 also assess first dose diagnostic scan administration radioactive iodine . The result obtain study help understand effect thyroid hormone metabolism , may lead important information optimize duration thyroid hormone therapy withdrawal treatment thyroid cancer .</detailed_description>
