	<detailed_description>Over past decade grow debate clinical value content single individual diagnostic indicator disease onset , progression therapeutic intervention . In particular discussion comparative value single biomarker versus panel ( 3-6 different analytes ) versus multi-analyte profile ( &gt; 10 different analytes ) biomarkers provide high content clinical information specific disease onset , progression , remediation treatment efficacy . With advent personalized medicine , recognition high degree biological variability human pathobiology , important understand comparative value single biomarker/diagnostic versus panel versus profile . In addition , growth Preventive Medicine spur development `` Wellness '' individual patient , necessity understand measure transition state health ( wellness ) ultimately state full blown disease onset . This complex process occur via multitude biological pathway network manifest biochemical clinical system level . In previous study currently analyze , MaiHealth measure Multi-Analyte Profile approximately 800 patient consist 400 cardiovascular compromise individual 400 control patient . This preliminary study single time point , 25 individual analytes measure well 3 calculated ratio value 800 individual . The current study small cohort time course study 6 month involve therapeutic intervention FDA-approved statin . The overall goal study determine predictive capability single versus panel versus multi-analyte profile set biomarkers cardiovascular compromise patient therapeutic intervention . The ultimate application research information delivery behavioral intervention .</detailed_description>
