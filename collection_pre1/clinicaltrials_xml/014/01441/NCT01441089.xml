	<brief_summary>Background : - Some gene may associate great chance side effect cancer treatment . These gene may also make certain treatment less effective . Researchers want collect blood cheek swab sample people cancer treatment study gene . Objectives : - To obtain blood cheek swab sample study genetic difference may affect cancer treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals cancer treat National Cancer Institute . Design : - Participants provide blood sample study . - Participants blood-based cancer , leukemia , provide cheek swab sample . - If blood cheek swab sample enough genetic material analysis , additional sample may collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Blood From Cancer Patients Genetic Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Genetic polymorphism drug-metabolizing enzyme , transporters/receptors might affect individual response drug therapy . - Inter-individual difference efficacy toxicity cancer chemotherapy especially important give narrow therapeutic index drug . - During analysis investigational agent , inter-individual variation pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ( PK/PD ) often note . Genetic variation gene encode protein regulate mediate metabolism transport drug often account wide variation see PK/PD , ultimately response , toxicity , anticancer agent . Objectives - To obtain analyze genomic DNA patient cancer therapeutic clinical trial . - To prospectively explore correlation genetic variant involve inter-individual difference drug disposition versus pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , response , toxicity endpoint patient receive anticancer agent . - To mitigate harm due treatment ineffective toxicity-inducing drug patient gene-drug interaction establish . Eligibility - All individual enrol IRB approve therapeutic clinical trial National Cancer Institute . Design - Exploratory study plan accrual 1,000 patient - Genomic DNA extract blood sample collect patient ( patient leukemia cheek swab sample collect ) genotyped use Affymetrix DMET . - In case patient carry genetic variant related poor outcome significant toxicity give drug , clinical recommendation provide specific instruction available package insert . This apply non-anticancer agent well give patient cancer often receive multiple agent manage side effect co-morbidities . - The association genetic variant DMET-covered gene correlate PK/PD clinical outcome response and/or toxicity .</detailed_description>
