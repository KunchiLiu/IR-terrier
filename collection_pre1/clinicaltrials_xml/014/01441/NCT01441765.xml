	<brief_title>PD-1 Alone With Dendritic Cell/Renal Cell Carcinoma Fusion Cell Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study divide 2 group . The first 22 subject Group 1 receive CT-011 . The next 22 subject Group 2 receive CT-011 DC RCC vaccine . Group 1 : Subjects cohort require tumor resection ( nephrectomy ) participate study . For subject undergo nephrectomy subject undergoing resection another metastasis , infusion CT-011 begin 21 35 day post-surgery . Subjects receive 4 cycle CT-011 therapy . Each cycle consist dose CT-011 give day 1 , 14 , 28 intravenously . For subject undergo nephrectomy standard care therapy , infusion CT-011 begin 21 28 day follow registration study . Subjects receive total four cycle CT-011 therapy . Each cycle consist dose CT-011 give day 1 , 14 , 28 intravenously . Group 2 : Subjects cohort choose undergo `` debulking nephrectomy '' ( surgery remove tumor kidney , cancer cell body ) standard treatment kidney cancer tumor lesion accessible ( may remove without major surgery ) remove treat diagnose cancer . All subject group receive infusion CT-011 21 35 day follow tumor resection . Subjects receive total 4 cycle CT-011 therapy . Each cycle consist dose CT-011 give day 1 , 14 , 28 . In addition receive vaccination DC RCC vaccine day 8 cycle .</detailed_description>
