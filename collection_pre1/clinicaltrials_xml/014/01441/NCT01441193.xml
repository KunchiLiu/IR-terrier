	<brief_summary>This Phase I study direct evaluate safety profile immunogenicity vaccination recombinant HIV-1 Tat V2-deleted Env ( delta-V2 Env ) proteins administer association healthy , immunologically competent adult , compare delta-V2 Env Tat alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Safety Immunogenicity Preventive Vaccine Trial Based HIV-1 Tat V2-deleted Env Proteins ( ISS P-002 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since inexorable spread HIV pandemic unabated , urgency design effective , safe , inexpensive easily administrable vaccine protect people HIV and/or AIDS absolute priority . Considering array function sequentially exert regulatory structural gene product support set primary HIV infection , expect vaccine combine early late viral product ( combine vaccine ) superior single antigen approach since target multiple viral protein necessary different key step virus life cycle , include cell-to-cell virus transmission systemic virus propagation . A combined vaccine strategy base early regulatory protein Tat association late structural protein Env modify increase immunogenicity ( delta-V2Env ) evaluate pre-clinical study small animal monkey . The result study indicate combination Tat delta-V2Env superior induce specific immune response Tat delta-V2Env antigen protect contain virus replication efficiently vaccination single antigens alone , confirm protein represent optimal co-antigens combine vaccine strategy . This study multicentric , open label , randomized phase I trial , direct qualify safety immunogenicity vaccine base association HIV-1 biologically active Tat oligomeric Î”V2 Env proteins healthy , immunologically competent adult volunteer , compare single compound . Tat delta-V2 Env proteins either association single compound administer prime-boost regimen , consist 3 intradermal priming dos follow 2 intramuscular boost injection . Of note , phase I trials already successfully conduct 2 single component , dos propose trial , healthy individual .</detailed_description>
