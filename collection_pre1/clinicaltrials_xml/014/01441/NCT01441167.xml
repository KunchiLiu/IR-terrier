	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria parasite carry mosquito , spread infection bite people . Currently , effective malaria vaccine . However , study show volunteer bite many time mosquito carry weaken malaria parasite could fight get sick malaria later expose normal malaria parasite . Malaria parasite weaken expose radiation stage development call sporozoite . Only mosquitoes irradiate study volunteer expose radiation . The radiation stop parasites able cause disease still promote protection . For many year , possible give sporozoite people vaccine since could adequately purify mosquito . Scientists recently figure produce isolate weaken sporozoite give injected vaccine . This vaccine know `` PfSPZ vaccine '' . - A malaria challenge use test whether vaccine prevent infection . In malaria challenge , mosquito malaria parasite allow bite participant 's arm . In event vaccine work , malaria parasite use challenge treat completely common anti-malaria medication . Participants treat immediately develop malaria symptom . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness PfSPZ vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test . There five different group study participant , monitor frequent blood test . - Group 1 two vaccine low amount vaccine give 4 week apart , regular clinic visit 24 week second vaccine . This group malaria challenge . - Group 2 four six vaccine give 4 week apart high dose group 1 . A malaria challenge give 3 week last vaccine . Follow-up visit continue 24 week last vaccine . - Group 3 four six vaccine give 4 week apart high dose group 2 . A malaria challenge give 3 week last vaccination , Group 2 . Follow-up visit continue 24 week last vaccine . - Group 4 four six vaccine give 4 week apart high dose group 3 . A malaria challenge give 3 week last vaccination . Follow visit continue 24 week last vaccine . - Group 5 serve control group receive vaccine , malaria challenge . Follow-up visit continue 8 week challenge . All participant group receive malaria challenge treat promptly malaria develops .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : VRC 312 second study PfSPZ Vaccine first study evaluate intravenous ( IV ) administration vaccine . The study design openlabel evaluation safety , tolerability , immunogenicity protective efficacy vaccine successively high dosage ( 2000 ; 7500 ; 30,000 135,000 SPZ per injection ) administer IV route . The 3 high dosage evaluate protection malaria challenge 4 6 vaccination . Control subject include malaria challenge . The primary objective study relate safety tolerability vaccine 4 dosage level administer IV ; secondary objective relate PfSPZ vaccine-mediated protection Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) challenge 3 high dosage level ; exploratory objective related immunogenicity PfSPZ Vaccine define immune correlate protection . Product Description : The investigational PfSPZ Vaccine manufacture Sanaria , Inc ( Rockville , MD ) current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ) . The vaccine consist suspension purify , metabolically-active , radiation-attenuated cryopreserved Pf sporozoite formulate cryoprotectant dispense 0.5 mL screw-cap vial contain 20 mcL aliquot concentration 150,000 sporozoite ( +/-50,000 sporozoite ) per 20 mcL . The vaccine store vapor-phase liquid nitrogen ( LNVP ) -140 -196 degree C. The PfSPZ Vaccine deliver Sanaria , Inc. clinical investigator dilute phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) 1 % human serum albumin ( HSA ) achieve correct dosage . Subjects : Healthy subject , 18-45 year old , malaria-naive . The few number subject need complete study originally design 51 ; however , inclusion study provision back-up challenge subject enrollment additional vaccinee option rechallenge , add protocol amendment , amend accrual allowance 68 subject . Study Plan : Subjects enrol step-wise , dose-escalation manner stringent stopping rule design subject safety . The first 12 subject allocate pilot subject comprise Groups 1 , 2a , 3a , 4a ; include 3 pilot subject . For pilot subject , 1st vaccination ( V1 ) 2nd vaccination ( V2 ) administer faster one per pilot subject every 2 hour . Before administration first dose subsequent pilot Group ( dose escalation ) , least 5 week cumulative safety data pilot subject dosage group ( i.e. , 1 week past 2nd vaccination ) must submit Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) FDA , protocol-specified approval receive dose escalation . Subjects vaccine Groups 2 , 3 , 4 Group 5 control challenge exposure Anopheles stephensi mosquito infect Pf sporozoite control setting , follow test parasitemia specify interval 28 day post-challenge . To facilitate intensive daily close monitor clinical status blood smear , 11 overnight stay require day 7-18 post-challenge . Subjects develop blood stage P. falciparum infection treat soon case identify protocol criterion . Following treatment , subject consider cure 2 consecutive daily blood smear negative . After establish cure , blood smear check may end subject may discontinue overnight stay . Challenges occur specify timepoints challenge include vaccine recipient control subject . Rechallenge option assess durability protective response evaluation immune correlate protection include protocol . Study Duration : The study take approximately 18 month complete . The period follow-up vaccinated subject least 24 week last vaccination . The total duration study vary depend upon schedule assignment whether subject participates rechallenge . The Group 5 ( challenge ) subject rechallenged subject follow 8 week last challenge .</detailed_description>
