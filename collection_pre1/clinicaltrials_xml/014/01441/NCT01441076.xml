	<brief_summary>Background : - Behcet disease ( BD ) autoimmune disease immune system attack body . People BD may develop oral genital ulcer , skin problem , eye disease . Most drug use treat BD suppress immune system , always helpful may side effect . A new drug , anakinra , may able treat BD few side effect . Because studied people BD , anakinra consider experimental treatment . Objectives : - To test whether anakinra safe effective treatment Behcet disease . Eligibility : - People active Behcet 's disease , oral genital ulcer within past month , three flare eye disease past 6 month . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test . They divide two group : oral genital ulcer eye disease . - All participant keep diary symptom month start study drug . - Participants oral genital ulcer receive daily injection anakinra 3 6 month . Treatment monitor frequent blood draw daily diary . Those improve full response drug may receive high dose . Those improve 6 month may extra 6 month either anakinra placebo study difference response . - Participants eye disease receive anakinra 12 month . Treatment monitor frequent blood draw , daily diary , regular eye exam . - All participant final study visit 1 month stop study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory disease illnesses characterized episode inflammation , unlike autoimmune disorder , lack production high titer autoantibody antigen-specific T cell . There grow genetic clinical evidence Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) play pathogenic role several disease . This exploratory study aim examine utility anakinra treatment adult subject Behcet Disease ( BD ) , disease show similarity know anakinra-responsive autoinflammatory disorder , familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome ( FCAS ) Muckle-Wells Syndrome ( MWS ) . Anakinra recombinant form human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist study RA autoinflammatory disorder . It half life 4 6 hour FDA approve recommend dose 100 mg/day subcutaneously treatment rheumatoid arthritis . This pilot study design address : 1 ) utility anakinra treatment BD ; 2 ) effect anakinra laboratory biomarkers BD ; 3 ) exploratory assessment safety anakinra individual Behcet Disease . Subjects oral genital ulcer receive anakinra three six month . If five initial seven patient positive response , 20 patient oral genital ulcer randomize withdrawal continuation drug six month placebo available . Patients eye disease treat anakinra total twelve month without randomization withdrawal . Clinical biochemical correlate inflammation measure appropriate interval assess response understand disease mechanism .</detailed_description>

Female patient screen pregnancy NIH visit . 8 . Women childbearing age men able father child , sexually active , agree use form effective birth control , include abstinence . 9 . Either ( 1 ) negative PPD test use 5 T.U . intradermal test per CDC guideline evidence active TB chest Xray time enrollment ( 2 ) positive PPD evidence active TB history chest Xray time enrollment either past present treatment adequate therapy least one month prior first dose study medication . Full prophylaxis regimen complete . Subjects BCGvaccinated also skintested . 10 . Able understand , complete studyrelated questionnaire . 11 . Able willing give inform consent abide study procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Treatment live virus vaccine 3 month prior baseline visit . No live vaccine allow throughout course study . 2 . Patients ocular disease receive local treatment eye drop ( i.e . periocular intraocular steroid , implant antiinflammatory agent within 4 week prior enrolment ) 3 . Current treatment TNF inhibitor discontinuation TNF inhibitor within 8 week . 4 . Presence active infection history pulmonary TB infection . Patients history exposure TB ( positive PPD ) treat TB prophylaxis regimen least one month . 5 . Chest xray read radiologist pleural scar and/or calcify granuloma consistent prior TB . 6 . Positive test prior history HIV , Hepatitis B C. 7 . History concomitant diagnosis congestive heart failure . 8 . History malignancy . Subjects deem cured superficial malignancy cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ cervical cancer may enrol . 9 . Known hypersensitivity CHO cell derive biologicals component anakinra . 10 . Presence additional rheumatic disease significant systemic disease . For example , major chronic infectious/ inflammatory/ immunologic disease ( inflammatory bowel disease , psoriatic arthritis , spondyloarthropathy , SLE addition autoinflammatory disease ) . 11 . Presence follow laboratory abnormality enrollment visit : creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN , WBC &lt; 3.6 times10 ( 9 ) /mm ( 3 ) ; platelet count &lt; 75,000 mm ( 3 ) ; ALT AST &gt; 2.0 time ULN 12 .

Subjects concern compliance protocol procedure . 16 . Presence severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , significant laboratory abnormality require investigation may cause undue risk subject safety , inhibit protocol participation , interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study . 17 .
