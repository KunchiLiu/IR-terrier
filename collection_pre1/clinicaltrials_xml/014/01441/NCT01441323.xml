	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct intervention study examine effect 16-week exercise diet intervention prevention disease , specifically type 2 diabetes heart disease , African American youth . Sixty overweight African American boys girl recruit place one follow intervention group : 1 ) Control Group ( delay intervention ) , 2 ) Dietary Education Group ( nutrition education focus reduce sugar &amp; soda , increase fiber &amp; whole grain intake ) , 3 ) Combination Strength Training ( twice/week 60 min , progressive increase exercise volume intensity ) + Dietary Education ( nutrition education focus reduce sugar &amp; soda , increase fiber &amp; whole grain intake ) . The investigator assess intervention group effect health parameter weight , body composition , insulin related measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A.1 Aims The overall goal project examine role strength train therapeutic intervention improve cancer obesity-related metabolic risk profile African-American adolescent . The project prompt urgent public health need prevent treat cancer obesity-related problem , include diabetes cardiovascular disease , African-American adolescent , population understudy medically under-served Los Angeles area . A recent report Institute Medicine underscore major public health concern childhood obesity field : `` Children 's health make tremendous stride past century . In general , life expectancy increase thirty year since 1900 much improvement due reduction infant early childhood mortality . Given trajectory toward healthy childhood , investigator begin 21st century shock development - epidemic obesity child youth . The increased number obese child throughout US past 25 year lead policymakers rank one critical public health threat 21st century . ( 92 ) '' Obesity metabolic syndrome problem disproportionately affect African-American adolescent ( 51 ) . This project explore African-Americans great cancer risk Hispanics ( 91 ) , despite reduce prevalence metabolic syndrome ( 7 , 62 ) . Preliminary work laboratory show African-American Hispanic child insulin resistant Caucasian child , difference apparently explain difference body fatness . Moreover , metabolic compensation similar degree insulin resistance markedly differ African-American Hispanic child ( 62 ) . African-Americans display great hyperinsulinemia response glucose challenge , whereas Hispanics subdue increase insulin level due increase second phase insulin secretion . The investigator opportunity build upon preliminary work examine effect resistance training three factor predictive cancer metabolic disease risk : 1 ) body fat distribution ; 2 ) insulin resistance 3 ) measure oxidative stress African America adolescent . The investigator previously study Hispanic adolescent parallel protocol . The overall hypothesis project : ( 1 ) hyperinsulinemia overweight African-American youth associate increase long-term cancer risk ; ( 2 ) insulin resistance , obesity oxidative stress overweight African-American youth improve chronic resistance training modify carbohydrate dietary approach . The investigator specifically examine follow metabolic outcome , hypothesize contribute obesity-related increase cancer metabolic disease risk : - Insulin concentration insulin sensitivity ; - Total body fat , abdominal visceral fat , muscle fat liver fat ; - Circulating adipocytokines ; - Intima-media thickness carotid artery - Markers oxidative stress , include : F2-isoprostanes , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , oxygen radical absorbance capacity ROS detection flow cytometry . A.2 Aims The specific aim hypothesis project 1 follow : Study 1 : Cross-Sectional Measures Specific Aim 1 ( Body Fat Compartments ) : To determine association visceral fat , muscle liver fat plasma adipocytokines variation insulin resistance African-American youth . - Hypothesis 1 : Visceral fat , muscle liver fat , adipokines independently contribute great insulin resistance . • Specific Aim 2 ( Insulin Resistance ) : To examine metabolic compensation insulin resistance African-American youth . - Hypothesis 2 : Insulin resistant African-American youth exhibit high acute insulin response glucose . • Specific Aim 3 ( Oxidative Stress ) : To examine influence body fat insulin resistance marker oxidative stress marker metabolic disease risk . - Hypothesis 3 : Increased total body fat insulin resistance associate great oxidative stress . The increased oxidative stress correlate high acute insulin response . Study 2 ( Randomized Trial Modification Carbohydrate Intake Strength Training ) • Specific Aim 4 ( Linkage factor Aims 1-3 ) : To determine effect randomize modification carbohydrate intake , and/or strength train intervention overweight African-American adolescent potential factor link obesity , insulin resistance , oxidative stress . - Hypothesis 4 : Strength training improve metabolic factor cancer risk . That , resistance train reduce visceral fat ; increase insulin sensitivity , reduce hyperinsulinemia , reduce oxidative stress . The decrease total body fat visceral adipose tissue associate improved insulin sensitivity oxidative stress .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Overweight ( ≥85th BMI percentile ) African American : Children initially define African American parent 4 grandparent self identify African American . Diabetes : Children eligible participation diagnostic criterion diabetes , include polyuria , polydipsia without unexplained weight loss , fast plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl , 2hour plasma glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL OGTT use dose 1.75g glucose/kg BW ( maximum 75g ) . Children also exclude test positive diabetesrelated autoantibody , include ICA512 GAD . Children test positive type 2 diabetes refer treatment . Children impair glucose tolerance ( fast glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL 2hour glucose &gt; 140 mg/dl oral glucose tolerance test ) and/or condition associate insulin resistance ( e.g . acanthosis nigricans , hypertension , dyslipidemia , polycystic ovarian syndrome ) eligible , long receive treatment meet eligibility criterion . Weight loss exercise program : currently involve weight loss exercise program , 6 month prior participation Use medication : take medication know influence body composition insulin action/secretion ( e.g . prednisone , ritalin , growth hormone ) Syndromes influence body composition : diagnose syndrome disease may influence body composition fat distribution ( e.g . Cushing syndrome , Down syndrome )</criteria>
