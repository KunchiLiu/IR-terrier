	<brief_summary>Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding ( OGIB ) one challenge area field gastroenterology , small bowel beyond reach ordinary endoscope like oesophagogastroduodenoscopy ( OGD ) colonoscopy . Thanks late technological advancement investigate small intestine , capable obtain intraluminal image safely capsule endoscopy ( CE ) . Its role obscure gastrointestinal bleeding , Crohn 's disease small bowel pathology already proven , nowadays suggest various authority first-line modality among small bowel investigation . The investigator group show CE alter clinical management patient OGIB - patient negative CE low rebleeding rate , therefore may adopt conservative approach . Although support group well , conflict result still report literature out-come patient . The main criticism study , CE identify 61 % underlie small bowel bleed pathology , one never ascertain outcome patient negative CE examination . Apparently still room improvement current CE technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Newer generation CE ( PillCam ColonTM ) develop investigate large bowel . It different small bowel CE consist two camera end capsule , enhance coverage colonic mucosa visualization . An improved generation colon capsule , name PillCam Colon 2TM , also developmental phase . With new `` adaptive frame rate '' ( AFR ) technology , CE optimize visual coverage bowel increase frame rate 35 frame per second capsule move quickly certain area , decrease frame rate 4 frame per second capsule move slowly remain stationary conserve battery life . Preliminary data colorectal cancer screen show could improve diagnostic yield colonic polyp . The investigator hypothesize , re-programming PillCam Colon 2TM initiate AFR since ingestion , could improve visualization small intestinal lumen hence improves sensitivity small bowel CE examination .</detailed_description>
