	<brief_summary>The study objective ass change corneal sensation dry eye sign symptom follow cataract extraction/femtosecond arcuate relaxing incision . Our clinical hypothesis determine combination cataract surgery femtosecond arcuate relax incision lead reduction corneal sensation onset worsen dry eye sign symptom .</brief_summary>

All arcuate relaxing incision place exactly 4.5 mm visual axis 9 mm optical zone . Corneal sensation Screening CochetBonnet Aesthesiometry floor stand &gt; 50 mm five region Be willing / able return require study visit comply instruction give study staff Potential best correct visual acuity post cataract surgery 20/20 Uncontrolled inflammation relate dry eye Corneal abnormality affect corneal sensation tear film stability ( except superficial punctate keratitis ( SPK ) ) . History ophthalmic herpes simplex zoster keratitis OSDI score &gt; 32 Active ocular allergy History refractive surgery surgery involve conjunctival , arcuate corneal incision Contact lens wear study . Soft contact lens wearer discontinue use least two week prior Screening visit . Rigid gas permeable ( RGP ) hard contact lens wearer discontinue use least one month prior Screening visit . Dry eye secondary Vitamin A deficiency , scar , pemphigoid , alkali burn , StevensJohnson syndrome , trachoma , irradiation . Currently use , use within 14 day study enrollment , ocular medication artificial tear Use topical cyclosporine ( Restasis ) within three month Screening visit . Have uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes ) presence significant illness ( e.g. , serious gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine , pulmonary , cardiac , neurological disease , cancer , AIDS , cerebral dysfunction ) could , judgment investigator , jeopardize subject safety interfere interpretation result study Temporary permanent occlusion lacrimal puncta Require chronic use systemic medication may induce affect dry eye condition ( e.g. , anticholinergic , cyclosporine , antihistamine , antimuscarinics , betablocking agent , tricyclic antidepressant , phenothiazine , estrogenprogesterone , estrogen derivative ) , unless medication use dose least 3 month expect remain constant course study Current anticipate use nutritional supplement ( e.g . flax seed oil , fish oil , omega3 supplement ) may affect dry eye condition .
