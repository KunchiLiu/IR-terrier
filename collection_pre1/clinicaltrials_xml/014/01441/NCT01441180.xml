	<brief_summary>Background : - GS-7977 new drug develop treat hepatitis C infection . It work block hepatitis C virus divide body . This medication use along medication commonly use treat hepatitis C , interferon ribavirin . When used interferon ribavirin , GS-7977 seem effective eliminate hepatitis C virus body . However , interferon serious side effect , researcher want see GS-7977 work ribavirin . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness GS-7977 alone give ribavirin hepatitis C infection . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age hepatitis C liver disease , never receive drug . Design : - This study require multiple clinic visit 18 month . A liver biopsy require start study participant one within past 3 year . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants either GS-7977 alone GS-7977 ribavirin . GS-7977 take mouth day . Ribavirin take mouth morning evening . - Participants study visit Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 . These visit involve regular blood test symptom monitoring . - After second week , participant study visit Weeks 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 . Blood urine test give study virus level body , symptom discuss . - Participants stop receive study drug Week 24 . - Followup clinic visit blood test take place Weeks 28 , 36 , 48 , 52 , 60 , 72 . Another liver biopsy perform 48 week . - Some participant may also part small study . This study involve frequent blood draw study drug virus level blood . The study require 36-hour hospital inpatient visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major public health problem estimate 180 million people infected worldwide . In United States estimate 4.1 million people infected HCV principal cause death liver disease lead indication liver transplantation . A combination ribavirin ( RBV ) pegylated interferon ( PegIFN ) currently recommend therapy chronic HCV infection may achieve viral clearance 19 % 52 % patient infected HCV genotype 1 ( GT-1 ) 76 % -80 % patient infected HCV genotypes 2 3 . The standard care change soon become HCV protease inhibitor [ Boceprevir/ Telaprevir combination PegIFN RBV ] . The registration study new protease inhibitor demonstrate increase sustained virologic response ( SVR ) rate 60 70 % . However , still associate high incidence adverse event ( AEs ) low cure rate several population . Novel therapy rely Interferon backbone require enhance cure rate various population . This randomized control open-label study ass safety , tolerability efficacy GS-7977 ( potent selective HCV NS5B inhibitor ) give dose 400 mg daily combination RBV total 60 treatment-na ( SqrRoot ) HCV genotype 1 mono-infected individual less equal stage 2 fibrosis . The finding study aid understand antiviral host response interferon ( IFN ) free regimen well determine role RBV IFN-free therapy .</detailed_description>
