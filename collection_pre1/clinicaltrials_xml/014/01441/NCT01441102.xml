	<brief_summary>Background : Many people diabetes macular edema ( swell ) back eye . Macular edema cause loss vision . Studies suggest inflammation may involve swell . A drug call dextromethorphan may help prevent inflammation swell . Dextromethorphan approve use cough medicine , study see help diabetic macular edema . Objectives : To see dextromethorphan help treat diabetic macular edema . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age diabetic macular edema least one eye . Design : - This study last 2 year , require least 14 visit National Eye Institute outpatient clinic . Study visit every month first 2 month every month . Each visit take 2 4 hour . - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , eye exam , blood test . One eye macular edema choose study eye test . - Participants take dextromethorphan twice day , 12 hour apart , 2 year . A study diary help keep track date , time , number pill take . - Participants study visit month first 2 month every month rest study . Each study visit involve eye exam blood urine test . - Four month start study medication , participant may laser surgery treatment macular edema , need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) one lead cause blindness United States . A frequent manifestation DR diabetic macular edema ( DME ) proven treatment laser photocoagulation . In retina , microglia capable migrate retina site inflammation associate closely neurons vasculature , key cellular player mediation process chronic inflammation implicate DME . For reason , microglia represent promise cellular target form therapy limit deleterious inflammatory change find DR . The objective study investigate safety efficacy dextromethorphan microglia inhibitor participant DME . Study Population : Eligibility criterion include presence diabetic retinopathy retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema within 3000 μm center macula measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , visual acuity well 20/200 study eye . Design : Five participant initially enrol unmasked pilot study . However , additional three participant may enrol account participant withdraw study prior receipt six month study treatment . Participants take oral dose 60 mg dextromethorphan twice daily 24 month . During visit , participant visual acuity measure undergo OCT test measure retinal thickness . Beginning Month 4 visit , participant assess worsen disease define loss ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter vision compare baseline ≥ 50 % increase total central retinal thickness measure OCT . Individual participant deem worsen disease may stay study continue receive study medication , allow receive focal laser therapy amenable leak microaneurysms and/or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) intravitreal injection ( bevacizumab ranibizumab ) discretion treat physician . Additionally , begin Month 6 visit , participant eligible treatment , either focal laser anti-VEGF injection center-involving macular edema . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change retinal thickness measure OCT 6 month compare baseline . Secondary outcome include change retinal thickness measure OCT 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , change mean macular sensitivity measure microperimetry 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , well change fluid leakage macula demonstrate fluorescein angiography 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity , adverse event .</detailed_description>
