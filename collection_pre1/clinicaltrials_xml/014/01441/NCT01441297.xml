	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy primary treatment option patient small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , lead 5-year survival 20 % limited disease ( LD ) , less 5 % extensive disease ( ED ) . Although initial tumor response rate chemotherapy high ( 96 % LD 65 % ED ) , SCLC relapse approximately 4 month ED 12 month LD . Despite administration second-line chemotherapy , overall median survival patient limited extensive disease approximately 18 9 month , respectively . In set second-line therapy , response rate chemotherapy range 15 25 % , median survival range 4-6 month . Second-line therapeutic option include cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine ( CAV ) give every 3 week topotecan , similar response rate , time progression survival two treatment arm ( topotecan 24 % , 13 24.7 week ; CAV 18 % , 12 22 week , respectively ) . However , treatment substantial toxicity , 9 % patient trial withdraw toxicity reason . Treatment-associated mortality high 4.7 % ( possibly definitely relate ) , many patient require transfusion support . Thus , treatment acceptable activity second-line , active less toxic treatment require patient population . The next generation anti-angiogenic drug aim improve clinical efficacy target multiple angiogenic factor . This approach validate recent analysis BIBF 1120 , inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFRs ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFRs ) fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFRs ) . BIBF 1120 result growth inhibition tumours syngeneic rat human tumour xenograft nude mouse . It also display favourable cellular duration action pharmacodynamic profile well-tolerated . These data complement early-phase clinical data suggest BIBF 1120 might effective anti-angiogenic agent . Some preclinical study show fibroblast growth factor-2 induces proliferation chemoresistance SCLC cell . In addition , selective fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) inhibitor PD173074 block H-510 H-69 SCLC proliferation clonogenic growth dose-dependent fashion prevents FGF-2-induced chemoresistance . BIBF1120 novel , orally available , potent triple angiokinase inhibitor predominantly block FGFR addition vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) . Therefore , investigator conduct phase II trial evaluate efficacy BIBF1120 patient recurrent SCLC .</detailed_description>
