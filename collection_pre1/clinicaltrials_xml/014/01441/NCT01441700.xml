	<brief_title>Prone Position Emergence From Anaesthesia Lumbar Disc Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tracheal irritation endotracheal tube , subsequent cough common emergence general anaesthesia supine position often thought complication , physiological response protect airway aspiration , although side-effects vital reflex may highly undesirable clinical practice . Coughing cause significant patient discomfort , may also cause hypertension , tachycardia , increase intracranial , intraocular , intra-abdominal pressure , may lead myocardial ischemia , arrhythmia , surgical complication . Supine extubation also lead increased incidence breath holding , laryngospasm , coughing , monitor disconnection . These haemodynamic airway response largely related movement endotracheal tube roll patient back supine position lighter depth anaesthesia conclusion surgery . Coughing , breath holding , laryngospasm also related pool secretion dependent patient airway supine position . Various technique drug prevention cardiovascular response cough emergence study , include extubation deep plane anaesthesia , administration intravenous drug esmolol , lidocaine , short-acting opioids , dexmedetomidine , intracuff lidocaine . A reliable mean prevent undesired coughing demonstrate date . Emergence prone position find associated less hemodynamic alteration , less coughing , laryngospasm , vomit monitor disconnection patient undergo lumbar surgery . There paucity data regard safety efficacy emergence anaesthesia prone position . The investigator present initial experience emergence anaesthesia prone position compare supine position normotensive patient undergo lumbar surgery prone position .</detailed_description>
