	<detailed_description>Research question 1 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP ( Positive End Expiratory Pressure ) intra-operative RMs ( Recruitment maneuver ) protect pulmonary complication patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? 2 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP intra-operative RMs protect extra-pulmonary complication patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? 3 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP intra-operative RMs shorten length hospital stay patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? 4 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP intra-operative RMs ameliorate post-operative wound heal patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? 5 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP intra-operative RMs attenuate post-operative unexpected need ICU admission ( i.e. , surgery patient schedule admission ICU , eventually admit ) ICU readmission patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? 6 . Does mechanical ventilation use high level PEEP intra-operative RMs influence intra-operative complication relate ventilator strategy ( i.e. , de-saturation , hypotension recruitment , need vasopressor ) ICU readmission patient high intermediate risk postoperative pulmonary complication schedule non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery ? Methods In international randomized control trial patient high intermediate risk post-operative pulmonary complication follow non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery general anesthesia eligible participation . To identify patient ARISCAT risk score use . Patients randomly assign mechanical ventilation level PEEP 12 cmH2O use recruitment maneuver ( lung-protective strategy ) mechanical ventilation level PEEP maximum 2 cmH2O without recruitment maneuver ( conventional strategy ) . Patients ventilate volume-controlled mechanical ventilation strategy . Although left discretion attend anesthesiologist use different fraction inspire oxygen , advise use least 0.4 , low oxygen fraction maintain oxygen saturation ≥ 92 % . The I : E ratio set 1:2 , respiratory rate adjust reach normocapnia ( etCO2 35 45 mmHg ) . Tidal volumes &lt; 8 mL/kg predict body weight ( PBW ) advise use . Recruitment maneuver , part lung-protective strategy , perform directly intubation , disconnection mechanical ventilator , directly tracheal extubation . Recruitment maneuver perform patient hemodynamic unstable , judge attend physician . To obtain standardization among center , recruitment maneuver perform follow : 1. peak inspiratory pressure limit set 45 cmH2O 2. tidal volume set 8 ml/kg PBW respiratory rate 6-8 breaths/min ( low respiratory rate anesthesia ventilator allow ) , PEEP set 12 cmH2O 3. inspiratory expiratory ratio ( I : E ) set 1:2 4. tidal volume increase step 4 ml/kg PBW plateau pressure 30-35 cmH2O 5 . 3 breath administer plateau pressure 30-35 cmH2O 6. peak inspiratory pressure limit , respiratory rate , I : E , tidal volume set back setting precede recruitment maneuver , maintain PEEP 12 cmH2O The study protocol stress routine general anesthesia , post-operative pain management , physiotherapeutic procedure fluid management must use peri-operative well post-operative period accord center specific expertise routine clinical use , minimize interference trial intervention . Centres The investigator aim recruit many centre possible worldwide , expect minimum 40 centre . Ethics approval National co-ordinators responsible clarify need ethic approval apply appropriate accord local policy . Centres permit record data unless ethic approval equivalent waiver place . The investigator expect , every participate country , patient informed consent require . Monitoring Monitoring patient safety review safety issue perform designated independent Data Safety Monitoring Board . The DSMB watch ethic conduct study accordance Declaration Helsinki . All ( serious ) adverse event collect National Coordinators send blind fashion designate SAE manager , present event DSMB evaluation . Interim analysis One main concern withhold positive effect open lung mechanical ventilation strategy control group . Therefore , interim analysis perform 300 600 patient . The first interim analysis perform 300 patient successfully include followed-up . If intervention strong trend improve post-operative pulmonary complication ( define ) p-value &lt; 0.0005 find 300 patient &lt; 0.014 600 patient , termination study consider . The third final analysis perform 900 patient p-value 0.045 significance . When post-operative pulmonary complication occur significantly frequent intervention group , terminate study due harm consider p ≤ 0.022 interim analysis . Blinding The patient blind allocated treatment trial . In participate center least 2 investigator involve study . One researcher involve mechanical ventilation practice operation room , he/she blind randomize intervention closely time tracheal intubation ( depend local situation ) - second investigator , blind randomization arm , score primary secondary post-operative endpoint . Data collection Data collect inclusion pre-operatively , intra-operatively post-operatively day 1 , day 2 , day 3 , day 4 , day 5 , day discharge day 90 . Data collection perform investigator blind randomization group bedside , except day 90 patient discharge . In case follow-up perform telephone . Data cod patient identification number ( PIN ) code keep safe local site . The data transcribe local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . Sample size calculation The required sample size calculate estimated effect size derive data collect ARISCAT study previous study incidence postoperative pulmonary complication . A two group χ2 test 0.05 two-sided significance level 80 % power detect difference ( post-operative pulmonary complication ) conventional mechanical ventilation ( 24 % ) open lung mechanical ventilation ( 16.5 % ) ( Odds ratio 0.626 ) sample size group 450 . Statistical analysis Normally distribute variable express mean standard deviation ; normally distribute variable express median interquartile range ; categorical variable express n ( % ) . In test group continuous normally distributed variable , Student 's t-test use . Likewise continuous data normally distribute Mann-Whitney U test use . Categorical variable compare Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate relative risk . Where appropriate statistical uncertainty express 95 % confidence level . Primary outcome total occurrence pulmonary complication within first 5 post-operative day , present percentage . The percentage analyze continuous data . If data normally distribute , Student 's t-test use normally distribute Mann-Whitney U test use . As randomized control trial , expect randomization large study population sufficiently balance baseline characteristic . Baseline balance test imbalance compensate pre-operative variable ARISCAT score . However imbalance occurs , confound factor correct use multiple logistic regression model . For treat proportion binary response ( complication occur day one day five post-operative ) . Time event variable ( primary secondary outcome ) analyze use proportional hazard model adjust possible imbalance patient ' baseline characteristic . Time course variable ( e.g . repeat measure vital parameter , blood value , VAS-scores , actual mobility ) analyze linear mixed model . The linear mixed model procedure expand GLM data permit exhibit correlate non-constant variability . The model include two factor : 1 ) study group ( fix factor , intervention control group ) , level study group factor different linear effect value dependent variable ; 2 ) time covariate , time consider random sample large population value , effect limit choose time . Organization The study conduct PROVHILO collaboration . National co-ordinators lead project within individual nation identify participate hospital , translate study paperwork , distribute study paperwork ensure necessary regulatory approval place . They provide assistance participate clinical site trial management , record keep data management . Local coordinator site perform randomization mechanical ventilation , supervise data collection ensure adherence Good Clinical Practice trial .
