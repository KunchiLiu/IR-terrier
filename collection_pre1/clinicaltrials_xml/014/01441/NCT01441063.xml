	<brief_summary>Background : - KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease ( KSHV-MCD ) cause herpes virus know KSHV . This disease also cause several cancer , include Kaposi sarcoma . People KSHV-MCD often symptoms like fever , weight muscle loss , fluid legs abdomen . Tocilizumab may able block chemical body cause KSHV-MCD symptom . Researchers want test drug anti-virus drug find best combination drug treat KSHV-MCD . Objectives : - To test effectiveness tocilizumab without anti-virus drug KSHV-MCD . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age KSHV-MCD certain symptom blood abnormality cause KSHV-MCD . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood test , skin biopsy . - Participants tocilizumab injection every 2 week 12 week . They provide daily blood sample first 3 day treatment . - After sixth dose , participant monitor 4 week check possible side effect . - Those whose KSHV-MCD improve worsens study may tocilizumab combine two anti-virus drug , zidovudine valganciclovir . These drug pill take four time day 5 day every 2 week . - Blood , urine , saliva sample collect throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus-associated multicentric Castleman disease ( KSHVMCD ) rare lymphoproliferative disorder develop predominantly HIVinfected patient . Patients often symptoms interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , KSHVencoded viral IL-6 ( vIL-6 ) , cytokines - Goals therapy include rapid resolution symptom elimination reservoirs KSHV-infected plasmablast . - Tocilizumab humanize anti-IL-6 receptor ( gp80 ) antibody activity MCD unrelated KSHV ( KSHV-negative MCD ) . While tocilizumab directly affect vIL-6 signal KSHV driven pathologic process , IL-6 overproduction play major role symptom KSHV-MCD , block IL-6 may sufficient treat disorder block autocrine paracrine stimulation . Combination zidovudine ( AZT ) valganciclovir ( VGC ) , agent target KSHV replication , virus-activated cytotoxic activity , active KSHV-MCD may useful necessary patient . OBJECTIVES : - Primary objective : Estimate clinical benefit tocilizumab 8mg/kg every 2 week 12 week patient symptomatic KSHV-MCD use modify KSHVMCD Clinical Benefit Response Criteria - Secondary objective : - Estimate best clinical , biochemical , radiographic , overall response patient KSHV-MCD treat 12 week tocilizumab 8mg/kg every 2 week use prior NCI KSHV-MCD Response Criteria . - In patient inadequate response tocilizumab monotherapy : explore preliminarily activity tocilizumab 8mg/kg every 2 week , combine AZT 600 mg orally q6 hour VGC 900 mg orally q12 hour day 1-5 14-day cycle - Evaluate safety tolerability tocilizumab alone combine AZT/VGC - Evaluate effect tocilizumab pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent CYP3A4 substrates patient symptomatic KSHV-MCD - Evaluate progression-free overall survival patient treat tocilizumab tocilizumab/AZT/VGC - Evaluate effect tocilizumab KS Eligibility - Pathologically confirm KSHV-associated MCD - Age great equal 18 - At least one clinical symptom least one laboratory attributable KSHV-MCD - ECOG performance status less equal 2 - No life- organ-threatening manifestation MCD - Patients require therapy rheumatoid arthritis exclude - HIV-infected patient must agree continue start combination antiretroviral therapy DESIGN : - Open label , single center pilot study . Eligible patient receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 2 week 12 week . In addition , patient require treatment intensification also receive AZT 600 mg orally q6 hour VGC 900 mg orally q12 hour day 1-5 14-day cycle . - Sample size 17 : two stage phase II design , alpha equal beta equal 0.10 , rule &lt; 20 % KSHV-MCD Clinical Benefit Partial Response well tocilizumab target &gt; 50 % KSHV-MCD Clinical Benefit Partial Response good require 10 first stage . 0-2 10 major response : stop accrual , 3+/10 : accrual 17 total . - Responses evaluate KSHV-MCD Clinical Benefit Response Criteria NCI KSHV-MCD criterion prospective evaluation . - Safety tolerability evaluate use current CTCAE .</detailed_description>
