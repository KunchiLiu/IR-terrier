Both drug seem able stop growth kill cancer cell . Researchers want combine see safe effective treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness PF-02341066 PF-00299804 advance non-small cell lung cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance non-small cell lung cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood urine test , image study . Heart lung function test eye exam may also give . - The first cycle treatment 28 day . Every cycle first 21 day .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Approximately 85 % lung cancer define histologically NSCLC majority patient present inoperable locally advanced ( Stage IIIB ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) disease curative treatment available . - Patients disease progression first-line treatment platinum-based doublet may candidate second-line treatment . - Recent evidence strongly implicate EGFR activate somatic mutation mechanism tumorigenesis determinant sensitivity EGFR TKIs NSCLC . - Despite dramatic initial response gefitinib erlotinib , 50 % NSCLC tumor develop resistance due secondary activate mutation EGFR , include EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation , 20 % acquire resistance due increase mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor ( c-Met ) signal . - There evidence limit number tumor patient acquire resistance EGFR-TKIs T790M cMET resistance mechanism occur patient different metastatic site even different fraction lesion . - Tumors acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib might vulnerable combination PF-00299804 second generation EGFR TKI also inhibitor T790M mutation , PF-02341066 inhibitor c- Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor ( HGFR ) . OBJECTIVES : - To define recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combine PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804 patient advance Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . - To assess overall safety tolerability , plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) clinical activity combine PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804 . - To analyze potential predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers tumor blood patient advance NSCLC acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib ELIGIBILITY : - Dose Escalation Phase : Adults histologically document diagnosis NSCLC locally advance metastatic , failure either least one chemotherapy regimen treatment erlotinib gefitinib . - Expansion Phase : Adults histologically document diagnosis NSCLC locally advance metastatic , acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib , must one lesion amendable biopsy . - All pathology sample review NCI . DESIGN : - Phase 1 , multi-center , open-label , non-randomized trial combine oral PF- 02341066 oral PF-00299804 patient advance NSCLC . Trial consist two phase . - Dose Escalation Phase : Patients treat vary dos combine PF- 02341066 plus PF-00299804 . Tumor biopsy require . - Expansion Phase : Two expansion cohort run concurrently follow completion Dose Escalation Phase . Both cohort enroll patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib , define progression follow initial response ( complete partial ) stable disease least six month erlotinib gefitinib . - The dose escalation phase dose expansion phase run concurrently insofar dose expansion phase enroll completion dose escalation phase provide dose use expansion phase already test escalation phase declare safe ; i.e. , specific safe dose escalation phase follow expansion phase . - Tumor biopsy mandatory Expansion Phase entrance , however , patient treat study drug irrespective biomarker identify analyzed retrospectively . The mandatory biopsy Expansion Phase necessary order identify acquired mutation change time . - Expansion cohort 1 continue evaluate safety , tolerability PK drug combination PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804 . - Expansion cohort 2 enroll patient either untreated prior PF- 00299804 progress single agent PF-00299804 administer ongoing clinical trial . Patients previously untreated PF-00299804 treat sequentially ; i.e. , first single agent PF-00299804 progression , combination PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804 . Those progressed single agent PF-00299804 another clinical trial treat combination PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804 .</detailed_description>

Concurrent use drug CYP3A4 substrates narrow therapeutic index , include limited pimozide , aripiprazole , triazolam , ergotamine halofantrine . Concurrent use drug highly dependent CYP2D6 metabolism include Smetoprolol , propafenone , timolol , amitriptyline , clomipramine , desipramine , imipramine , paroxetine , haloperidol , risperidone , thioridazine , codeine , flecainide , mexilletine , tamoxifen , venlafaxine . Dextromethorphan , CYP2D6 , substrate allow medically indicate suitable alternative antitussive medication available . However , dose dextromethorphan may need modify . In clinical study healthy volunteer extensive metabolizers ( A7471039 ) PF00299804 increase mean total exposure ( AUC ( last ) C ( max ) ) dextromethorphan 855 % 874 % , respectively , follow concomitant administration PF00299804 45 mg compare exposure administration dextromethorphan alone . Extensive metabolizers comprise approximately 80 % population , ultra , intermediate , poormetabolizers account remain portion general population . Therefore , alternative available dextromethorphan dose initiate low dose ( approx 25 % ) close monitoring patient clinical status . Dose increase decrease dextromethorphan may consider base upon individual patient tolerability . Lidocaine may use systemically clinical monitoring ( include telemetry ) . Opiates morphine , oxycodone , dihydrocodeine , hydrocodone , tramadol use substitute replace codeine . Use opiate monitor altered analgesic effect treatment may partly metabolize CYP2D6 .</criteria>
