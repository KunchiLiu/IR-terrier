	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate biologic target activity dasatinib CLL patient find pre-treatment vitro dasatinib cytotoxicity ( define &gt; = 50 % decrease absolute lymphocyte count and/or bone marrow CLL count and/or lymph node spleen size ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall objective response rate per CLL National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) work group . II . To determine drug safety tolerability dasatinib patient CLL . III . To determine overall ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine v-src avian sarcoma ( Schmidt-Ruppin A-2 ) viral oncogene homolog ( SRC ) , Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , tec protein tyrosine kinase ( TEC ) family kinase inhibition correlate clinical response . II . To determine prognostic subgroup ( presence &gt; = 1 following : 11q 17p deletion ; cluster differentiation [ CD ] 38 zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 [ Zap 70 ] expression ; unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain [ IgVH ] ) respond dasatinib therapy . III . To evaluate difference baseline CLL gene expression CLL sample sensitive in-sensitive dasatinib . IV . To analyze change CLL gene expression dasatinib treatment . V. To evaluate dasatinib pharmacokinetics . VI . To evaluate change type I receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor ( ROR-1 ) expression dasatinib treatment . VII . To correlate response pre-clinical IC50 presence/absence HS-5 condition medium . VIII . To explore role possible kinase mutation related dasatinib response . IX . To measure chemokines treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) course 1 tolerate , twice daily ( BID ) subsequent course . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
