	<brief_summary>Background : - Parainfluenza virus cause infection people . Most people infected virus mild symptom include fever , cough , red eye , runny nose ( common cold ) . Some people , especially weaken immune system , get sick virus . They may difficulty breathe develop lung infection . Currently , specific treatment parainfluenza . However , drug call DAS181 may make virus go away faster . Researchers interested test DAS181 see safe effective parainfluenza . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness DAS181 treatment parainfluenza . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age parainfluenza virus develop symptom within past 10 day . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , question symptoms activity level . Participants also lung function test provide blood nasal fluid sample . - DAS181 inhaled medication , everyone receive study medication inhaler . Participants receive either DAS181 placebo inhaler . They take every day 5 day . - Participants monitor visit day 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 28 provide blood nasal fluid sample lung function test . - Participants still virus system Day 28 return clinic Day 42 test . Participants still virus system Day 42 return clinic Day 56 test . - Participants followup visit 6 month 1 year start study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parainfluenza virus ( PIV ) infection cause considerable morbidity immunocompromised population . In immunocompetent population , PIV usually self-limited , cause severe disease include pneumonia tracheobronchitis adult , croup bronchiolitis young child . DAS181 , inhale sialidase , cleave bind site PIV respiratory mucosal cell limit ability PIV infect new cell . This may improve outcome patient PIV infection . This exploratory randomized double-blind Phase 2 study ass safety tolerability , explore efficacy DAS181 versus placebo treatment parainfluenza . Thirty eligible patient diagnose parainfluenza randomized 2:1 allocation receive either DAS181-F02 formulation ( 10 mg time 5 day ) placebo . Subjects follow Study Days 0 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 28 , 180 , 365 series clinical , pulmonary function , functional status , virologic , safety assessment .</detailed_description>
