	<detailed_description>The rate pancreatic fistula pancreas resection 10 % surgeon traditionally place drain near pancreatic anastomosis control potentially serious complication . In recent year , advance interventional radiology allow safe percutaneous drainage intra-abdominal fluid collection . Some surgeon abandon routine use prophylactic drain place time pancreas resection rely percutaneous drainage minority patient develop pancreatic fistula . Hypothesis : This randomized prospective trial design test hypothesis pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage increase severity frequency complication within 60 day surgery . The primary endpoint ass severity complication number patient ≥ Grade II complication . Severity complication experience also assess compare number patient , ≥ Grade III complication , serious adverse event ( SAE ) , median complication severity grade complication . The frequency complication assess compare number patient 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5 complication severity grade . Objectives : Primary : Difference 60-day ≥ Grade II complication rate comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . Secondary : A . 60-day ≥ Grade III complication rate comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . B . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) rate comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . C. Median complication severity grade comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . D. 60-day frequency complication ( Grade ) patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . E. 60-day , 90-day mortality rate comparison patient receive pancreatetomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . F. Rate specific complication compare patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . G. Length stay ( index admission total within 60 day ) comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . H. Crude cost comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage . I . Quality life comparison patient receive pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage receive routine intraperitoneal drainage .</detailed_description>
