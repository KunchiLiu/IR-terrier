	<brief_title>Irinotecan/Cisplatin With Without Simvastatin Chemo-naive Patients With Extensive Disease-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ) use treat hypercholesterolemia . Besides lipid lowering effect , also act anti-inflammatory anti-cancer agent . Recently investigator demonstrate synergistic cytotoxicity Simvastatin Irinotecan human lung cancer cell . Simvastatin enhance Irinotecan-induced apoptosis inhibition proteasome activity . All additional action may counteract harmful effect smoking-induced chronic inflammation . These property together high safety profile make Statins attractive drug small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , highly smoking-related cancer . Given promising preclinical anti-tumor anti-inflammatory effect Simvastatin SCLC , recently investigator conduct phase II study Simvastatin Irinotecan/Cisplatin ( IP ) chemotherapy chemo-na√Øve- patient Extensive disease-small cell lung cancer ( ED-SCLC ) . The 1-year survival rate 39.3 % . The median overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) 11.0 month 6.1 month , respectively . Overall relative risk ( RR ) 75 % . The common toxicity neutropenia ( 67 % ) . The efficacy significantly associate smoking-status . Compared never-smokers , ever-smokers higher RR ( 40 % v 78 % , P=0.01 ) long PFS ( 2.5 month v 6.4 month , P=0.018 ) show trend toward improve OS ( 9.0 month v 11.2 month , P=0.095 ) . The effect smoke survival apparent subdivide ever smoker accord pack-years ( PY ) . Ever-smokers smoke &gt; 65 PY show significantly longer OS compare ever-smokers smoke &lt; = 65 PY never-smokers ( 20.6 month v 10.6 month v 9.0 month , log-rank P=0.032 ) . In multivariate analysis , PY &gt; 65 predictive long survival ( hazard ratio ) HR=0.377 [ 95 % CI ( confidence interval ) , 0.157-0.905 ] ) . These finding suggest addition Simvastatin Irinotecan Cisplatin improve efficacy ever-smokers ED-SCLC . The survival benefit combination seem apparent heavy-smokers .</detailed_description>
