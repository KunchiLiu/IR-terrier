	<brief_summary>Background : - Pain common symptom sickle cell disease . Episodes severe sickle cell pain know `` crisis . '' High rate pain crisis associate high risk early death . Some people sickle cell disease many severe pain crisis others experience few crisis . This difference pain crisis may cause sensitivity pain . People high sensitivity pain may pain crisis . Many factor , include person 's genetic makeup , determine sensitivity pain . Comparing genetic information people sickle cell disease healthy volunteer may provide information pain sickle cell disease . Objectives : - To study genetics pain sensitivity sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - African African American individual least 18 year age sickle cell disease . - Healthy African African American volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also provide blood urine sample . - Participants follow test : - Quantitative sensory test measure sensitivity pressure , heat , cold , mechanical pain . - EndoPat test measure blood vessel function reaction . - Questionnaires mood , evidence depression , pain , quality sleep , sleep disturbance . - Measures daily pain , whether related sickle cell disease . - After first visit , study monthly study visit 6 month . The test repeat visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common genetic disease United States inherit autosomal recessive disorder , approximately 70,000 individual sickle cell disease . Acute painful vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOCs ) one common complication SCD influence overall survival ( Platt , Thorington et al . 1991 ) . Pain , also common cause SCD morbidity , negative impact quality life individual family . There significant inter-individual variation frequency course severe VOCs result hospital base treatment , reason clearly elucidate . Vaso-occlusion irreversibly sickle red cell within microcirculation believe proximate cause painful VOCs , however likely non-SCD related factor affect pain perception sensitivity pain also contribute individual susceptibility pain therefore contribute observe inter-individual variability course VOC . Early identification individual high risk develop severe pain related morbidity chronic pain syndromes crucial since early multimodal intervention might potential minimize morbidity mortality associate VOCs . &lt; TAB &gt; Patients SCD hypothesize low nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailability due NO scavenging cell free hemoglobin release plasma red cell hemolysis . NO deficiency identify key factor development vascular dysfunction SCD . NO also recently identify key mediator process nociceptive signal modulation pain non-SCD model . Thus , low NO associate low pain perception ( Meller , Dykstra et al . 1992 ; Tegeder , Costigan et al . 2006 ) . GTP cyclohydrolase ( GCH1 ) rate-limiting enzyme synthesis essential cofactor NO production metabolism aromatic amino acid , namely tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) . Therefore hypothesized genetic variant GCH1 gene affect BH4 level secondary impact vascular dysfunction sensitivity pain SCD . The primary goal protocol establish pattern sensitivity experimental pain among subject SCD compare healthy African American control . In addition , exploratory analysis determine increase sensitivity experimental pain correlate frequency intensity clinical pain SCD . Once expect pattern experimental pain phenotype establish cohort SCD , explore role GCH1 genetic variant experimental pain perception vascular function . If successful , long term secondary objective establish sufficiently large patient cohort experimental pain phenotype future exploratory genetic study investigate role locus might influence sensitivity experimental pain vascular function SCD .</detailed_description>
