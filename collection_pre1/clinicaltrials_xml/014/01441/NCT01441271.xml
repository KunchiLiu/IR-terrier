	<brief_title>Optimal Surgical Treatment Of Fulminant Clostridium Difficile Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) affect 3 million patient per year United States , increase frequency [ 2-15 ] . Approximately 8 % hospitalized patient infect C. difficile [ 12 ] . Of patient 3 % - 8 % develop fulminant disease , define C. difficile colitis significant systemic toxic effect shock , result need colectomy death [ 2 ] . Fulminant C. difficile colitis ( FCDC ) highly lethal disease mortality rate range 12 % - 80 % [ 2-6,8-15 ] . A retrospective study institution identify 35 % mortality rate FCDC [ 2 ] . The indication surgical management patient FCDC clearly define , however advocate surgical intervention patient worsen clinical exam , peritonitis , patient shock . Total abdominal colectomy ( also call subtotal colectomy ) end ileostomy advocate operation choice demonstrate marginally improve survival compare non-operative management critically ill patient . A total abdominal colectomy many disadvantage . Most important , mortality rate continue range 35-80 % . Additionally , total abdominal colectomy ( subtotal colectomy ) result significant morbidity , many survivor permanent ileostomy . The new treatment option test randomize control trial ( RCT ) may change standard care . Based small prospective series Neal colleague [ 1 ] investigator propose alternative surgical approach management FCDC , may prove safe simpler option . Based nature disease bacterial toxin-mediated mucosal inflammatory process delay indirect systemic threat life , investigator think minimally invasive ileal diversion intraoperative colonic lavage use high volume polyethylene glycol/electrolyte solution clear Clostridium difficile infection result eradication FCDC preserving colon .</detailed_description>
