	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people bone marrow lung disorder cause genetic problem . These problem often involve damage end chromosomes pass gene . One disorder aplastic anemia . This disorder bone marrow make enough blood cell . Currently , doctor use male hormone-based drug call Danazol improve bone marrow function treat aplastic anemia . More information need whether Danazol help repair damage chromosome cause aplastic anemia similar disorder cause low blood cell count lung problem . Objectives : - To study safety effectiveness Danazol bone marrow lung disorder cause damage gene . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age low blood cell count lung fibrosis cause damage gene . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Then blood urine test , image study , lung function test . They also take 6-minute walk test bone marrow biopsy . - Participants receive Danazol take twice day duration study . - Participants regular study visit 6 , 12 , 24 month , blood test , image study , lung function test , 6-minute walk test . A bone marrow sample collect 12-month visit . - Participants remain study 2 year . Researchers follow 2 year end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterize pancytopenia hypocellular bone marrow . Telomeres report short one-third patient SAA.Initially occurrence presumed secondary hematopoietic stress . However , discovery loss-of-function mutation gene telomerase complex ( TERC , TERT ) establish genetic etiology telomere attrition patient marrow failure stigma associate inherited bone marrow failure syndrome . These finding implicate telomerase dysfunction fail hematopoiesis . In family member probands SAA , telomerase mutation observe associated varying degree cytopenias , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) and/or cirrhosis . Telomere length associate human cancer . Telomere attrition implicate variety solid organ malignancy include esophageal colon adenocarcinoma . In longitudinal population base study , short telomere length associate high cancer mortality risk overtime . It plausible shorter telomere length biomarker associate development cancer , involve pathogenesis . Ample experimental data support important role critically short telomere length genomic instability . Furthermore , laboratory data ( unpublished ) show similar chromosome instability occur bone marrow cell mutant patient , confirm experimental data . Thus , common molecular mechanism appear underlie risk cancer range clinical entity . In vitro study suggest telomere length could , theory , modulate sex hormones.15 Exposure normal peripheral blood lymphocyte human bone marrow derive CD34+ cell androgen increase telomerase activity vitro androgen increase low baseline telomerase activity individual carry loss-of-function TERT mutation normal level . In retrospect , beneficial effect sex hormone telomerase activity may mechanism SAA patient treat 40 year ago male hormone show hematologic improvement case . In recent year see patient refer clinic varying degree cytopenia ( ) significant family history cytopenia ( ) , IPF and/or cirrhosis . We identify short telomere patient mutation TERC TERT . We hypothesize male hormone therapy might modulate telomere attrition vivo ameliorate progression reverse clinical consequence accelerate telomere attrition . Therefore , propose male hormone therapy patient cytopenia ( ) and/or IPF show evidence telomere dysfunction short age adjust telomere length associate telomerase gene mutation . The primary biologic endpoint delay telomere attrition time compare know rate telomere erosion normal individual carry mutation telomerase gene . The main clinical endpoint tolerability oral danazol two year . Secondary endpoint improvement blood count and/or pulmonary function . The small sample size , lack control group , variable clinical course among marrow failure IPF , allow definitive assessment clinical benefit . Nevertheless , believe protocol provide insight possible effect androgen therapy telomere attrition human possible clinical benefit telomere related disorder , serve hypothesis generate large control study .</detailed_description>
