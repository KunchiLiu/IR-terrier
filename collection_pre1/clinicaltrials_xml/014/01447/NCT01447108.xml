	<brief_title>Surface Acoustic Wave Ultrasound Trigeminal Neuralgia Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : Trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ) one severe progressive form chronic neuropathic pain . The late scientific work show likely cause TN highly reversible tiny central nervous system ( CNS ) lesion root entry zone ( REZ ) trigeminal nerve measure less 0.5 cm cubed . The presence discrete , highly eloquent highly reversible central nervous system ( CNS ) lesion present unique opportunity test measure neuroegenerative potential therapeutic modality effectively deliver site pathology . Ultrasound show effective treatment demyelination find carpal tunnel syndrome man ( Ebenbicher , Resch , Nicolakis , Weisinger , Uhl , Ghanemm Fialka 1998 ) , numerous research study show ability accelerate peripheral nerve regeneration functional recovery rat ( Crisci Ferreria , 2002 ) . There also grow body scientific evidence demonstrate efficacy ultrasound facilitate wound heal analgesia . Numerous publish research study ultrasound , specifically LILFU , provide Level 1 evidence efficacy bone healing , prevention treatment fracture non-union , acceleration fracture healing , also show promise field tendon healing . ( Campbell C.K Jorns 2007 ) . In vitro , low-intensity ultrasound , show direct non thermal effect cell physiology , stimulate expression numerous gene involve heal process , include aggrecan , insulin-like growth factor , transform collagen , nitric oxide synthase , cytokine , angiogenesis ( Devor , Amir Rappaport , 2002 ) . A dynamic balance appear exist ongoing neural damage repetitive mechanical stress sight neurovascular compression ongoing effort LILFU repair damage via endogenous remyelination . The investigator hypothesize nature balance may determine whether TN sufferer find either TN pain crisis remission . This would explain remission recurrence pattern typically see early course disease well progressive nature illness , may attributable progressive effect repetitive micro-injury . It possible LILF/SAWU might catalyst promote neuroregeneration thus help induce sustain remission 2 . Rationale study TN , form neuropathic pain , generally consider one severe life disrupting pain know patient . Unfortunately , people , TN progressive illness intensifies become difficult control year . Medication , although often initially affective , usually lose effectiveness trajectory course illness . Each patient TN different response medication his/her pain , year disease progression , many eventually find medication adequately control progressively worsen condition . ( Zakrezewska Linskey , 2009 ) Medication show slow progression disease . On contrary , year , many people find take high dos medication take several different medication together control pain resultant accumulation problematic side effect . Eventually , long term , half trigeminal neuralgia patient seek surgical solution manage pain . ( Zakrezewska et al.2009 ) There grow emphasis desire minimally invasive therapy treatment abnormal pathology disease particularly TN . Although stereotactic radio-surgery presently one least invasive procedure , potentially serious adverse effect , permanent nerve damage , cause weakness sensory impairment , case anesthesia dolorosa , also occur ablative procedure ( Emril Ho , 2010 ) As state earlier , intractable pain appear due highly reversible micro lesion CNS REZ trigeminal nerve consider result focal microvascular compression . The result demyelination dysmyelination contribute ephatic transmission large myelinated fiber pain conduct C-fibers possibly trigger pulsatile compression artery injure nerve . The reversibility small CNS injury witness rapid onset recovery Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ( SSEP 's ) measure pre-operatively time surgical decompression well fact anatomical study show little axon-notmesis . ( Leandri 2002 , Devor 2002 Love , 1998 ) ) Our hypothesis initial intermittent nature TN pain witness delicate balance repetitive injury REZ trigeminal nerve body inherent ability overcome show anatomical study show sign remyelination . The presence discrete yet highly reversible CNS lesion present unique opportunity future research test objectively measure neuroregenerative potential therapeutic modality effectively deliver site pathology attempt reinforce potential CNS regenerate CNS myelin destroy disease . Today , readily accessible therapy central peripheral neuropathic pain hold promise facilitating neuroregeneration . Ultrasound deliver injured nerve show five animal study past eight year neuroregenerative capacity also associate improved remyelination carpal tunnel syndrome human one RCT ( Ebenbicher , Resch , Nicolakis , Weisinger , Uhl , Ghanemm Fialka 1998 ) Ultrasound deliver injured nerve show several study reverse nerve damage commonly see trigeminal nerve patient 's TN . ( Crisci 2002 , Chang 2004 , Mourad 2001 , Paik 2002 , Zhou 2006 ) Traditional high energy , high frequency bulk wave ultrasound device penetrate cranium , therefore , use treat REZ trigeminal ganglion . Until advent Painshield™ device , low intensity , low frequency surface acoustic wave ultrasound technology ( LILF/SAWU ) apply field medicine . It , however , ever-present cell phone device ' electronic circuit ( Campell C.K ) . Based known physical property SAW acoustic , expect SAW transducer apply surface underlie bone , forehead , energy spread entire surface bony skull internal foramen . It efficiently transmit via cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) CNS structure situate close beside bony structure . Hence , REZ ganglion trigeminal nerve , well entire length branch , expose potentially heal acoustic ultrasound energy . The PainShieldTM system novel , patch base therapeutic ultrasound product , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment painful condition , include trigeminal neuralgia . The device portable battery power connect disposable patch delivers localize energy create wave , affect localize pain induce soft tissue heal . This make possible due company 's proprietary technology allow creation therapeutic transducer make disposable incorporated patch . Until Painshield™ technology come light ; available ultrasound device could safely deliver surface acoustic ultrasound technology intracranially , several hour daily . In single blind crossover study , investigator aim determine effectiveness Low Intensity Low Frequency Surface Acoustic Wave Ultrasound ( LILF/SAWU ) treatment TN pain . 3 . Objectives Hypothesis : The primary objective study determine effectiveness Low Intensity Low Frequency Ultrasound Surface Acoustic Wave ( LILFU/SAW ) treatment TN use single blind n=1 cross study design . Our hypothesis ( H1 ) LILFU treatment , via Painshield™ , provide pain relief patient suffer chronic TN measure modify Barrow Neurological Index score . The investigator hypothesize ( H2 ) follow relief pain TN sufferer enjoy improve functional health well measure SF-36 . This turn lead hypothesis ( H3 ) TN sufferer reduce amount medication consume month , report participant . 4 . Study Design : The study design single blind crossover trial . This design choose TN rare disease recruitment adequate subject formal RCT would prove difficult . Subjects diagnose refractory TN least six month despite currently undergo optimize pharmacotherapy ( BNI V ) treat four week placebo PainSheield™ continue current pharmaco- analgesic regimen . All patient cross active Painshield™ therapy next four week . They apply Painshield™ patch forehead six-eight hour night ( depend many hour sleep ) four week . At end second month study , patient offer either continue active PainShield™ treatment third final month , return `` sham '' PainShield™ treatment . Assessment pain via BNI index Short form MCGILL Pain Questionnaire ( `` SFMPQ '' ) record two week interval throughout three month study . Functional health wellbeing measure SF-36 Questionnaire intake , cross time ( initial four week ) , post `` Active '' treatment end three month study period . Statistical Analysis : The follow parameter calculate : 1 . Mean score Barrow Neurological Index . 2 . Mean score SF-36 dimension ( General health , role limitation due physical problem , physical function bodily pain ) . 3 . Percentage patient choose continue active Painshield™ treatment four week . 4 . Proportion/ percentage BNI scores- Initial response treatment define improvement patient-reported BNI score level BNI &lt; IIIB . Comparisons BNI score group evaluate use follow statistical test : independent pair T-test SF-36 score , Wilcoxon test BNI score , Chi-Square test order calculate proportion BNI score .</detailed_description>
