	<brief_summary>This non-inferiority , prospective study relationship 24-hour urine protein collection spot protein : creatinine ratio diagnosis preeclampsia involve sample 18-45 year-old pregnant woman attend new Obstetrics orientation . The investigator follow participant consent part study throughout entire pregnancy . Those get evaluated preeclampsia P : C ratio anytime Primary Obstetrics provider order standard care 24-hour urine collection ( standard care ) . Those participant evaluate preeclampsia pregnancy drop study . Participants evaluate preeclampsia prenatal period ask provide random spot clean-catch urine sample interval approximately 0 24 hour follow initiation 24-hour urine collection . The patient 's demographic clinical data , well spot protein : creatinine ratio 24-hour urine protein collect analyzed conclusion study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Random Spot Urine Protein : Creatinine Ratio 24-Hour Timed Urine Protein Collection Evaluation Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit total 12,000 pregnant female subject age 18-45 confirmed positive pregnancy test attend new Obstetrics Orientation class . Subjects recruit MOFH Eglin . Visit 1 : - Obtain sign Informed Consent document HIPAA Authorization ( research-driven ) - Review Medical History record patient age , gestational age , parity presence high-risk antepartum condition ( i.e . chronic hypertension , gestational diabetes mellitus-all class , pre-existing renal disease ) ( standard care ) All participant consent part study follow throughout entire pregnancy ( birth child ) . Those identified primary obstetrics provider potentially preeclampsia P : C Ratio anytime Primary Obstetrics provider order standard care 24-hour urine collection ( see Antepartum Visit Schedule Below ) . Those participant evaluate preeclampsia pregnancy drop study end pregnancy ( birth child ) . Antepartum Visit : - Collect 24-hour protein urine ( standard care ) - Collect spot random urine protein : creatinine ratio ( 0 24 hour ) ( research-driven ) - Perform urinalysis identify subject may Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) ( participant test positive UTI , exclude data point , however , continue study data collect subsequent urine collection give UTI longer present ) ( research-driven ) Participants recruit new Obstetrics Orientation class baseline data may use compare participant 's `` non-pregnant '' physiological state late gestation ( i.e . time develop preeclampsia ) . Previous study directly compare baseline later gestational data would show whether correlation P : C ratio 24 hour urine protein change remain unchanged . This data would clinically relevant determine presence preeclampsia understand spot protein : creatinine ratio may may retain strong correlation 24 hour urine protein gestational age . Participants continually follow Primary Obstetric provider , provide standard care . This include notifying patient worsen condition preeclampsia , laboratory result , treatment preeclampsia , teach involved diagnosis treatment preeclampsia . The amount urine collect standard care 24-hour urine approximately 2,000 milliliter ( ml ) urine . The amount need order process P : C Ratio approximately 10mls 0 hour 24 hour ( total 20mls ) . Participants follow standard procedure 24-hour urine collection . During first urination ( 0 hour ) last urination ( 24 hour ) participant pour 50 mls urine cup Each site 's Laboratory responsible analyze urine sample obtain site study . Samples label would standard laboratory draw . All Laboratories Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify use procedure process Laboratory specimen mention research project . SUBJECTS COMPLETING THE STUDY : Subject 's participation study complete conclusion pregnancy . Subjects tell result protein urine spot random urine protein : creatinine ratio primary obstetrics provider study complete . Upon completion study , Associate Investigator send de-identified data Principal Investigator via encrypt email analysis . Associate Investigators also responsible send Principal Investigator Informed Consent HIPAA Authorization document via encrypted email retention conclusion study . WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES : If time study , subject decides withdraw study , may test require , beyond require standard care . DEVIATIONS : Deviations increase risk subject like list `` risk '' section protocol report Principal Investigator study 1st workday every month via `` WHMC Tracking Log Problems Not Requiring Immediate Reporting '' . This do ensure ongoing monitor identification trend may arise .</detailed_description>
