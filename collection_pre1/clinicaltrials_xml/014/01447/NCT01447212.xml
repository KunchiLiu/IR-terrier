	<brief_summary>The purpose study , SALOME , determine 1 ) closely supervised provision injectable , hydromorphone ( HDM ; trade name Dilaudidâ„¢ ) effective injectable diacetylmorphine ( DAM ; heroin ) treatment chronic , multi-morbid opioid-dependent individual benefit sufficiently conventional treatment , switch oral equivalent hydromorphone diacetylmorphine effective injection form . The availability effective , licensed opioid medication hydromorphone , substitution treatment chronic , multi-morbid treatment-refractory opioid-dependent individual , would immense impact locally internationally . It could help establish alternative treatment option non-medical reason Heroin Assisted Treatment would acceptable . Thus , one result could expansion treatment option difficult treat heroin dependent person . This would also important step secondary prevention HIV Hepatitis C well good integration patient medical treatment . Switching intravenous oral application would also reduce lot potential risk factor ( like overdose , seizure , infection , etc ) side effect associate injection route . Additionally could make treatment feasible normal treatment setting , like exist methadone service .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness ( SALOME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SALOME two-stage single centre ( Vancouver ) phase III , randomize , double blind control trial involve total 202 individual chronic opioid-dependence benefit currently conventional therapy . Objectives : The general objective study determine whether 1 ) closely supervised provision injectable , hydromorphone effective injectable diacetylmorphine recruiting , retain , benefit chronic , multi-morbid opioid-dependent individual benefit sufficient conventional treatment , 2 ) switch oral equivalent hydromorphone diacetylmorphine six-months effective injection form . Secondary outcome evaluate look benefit drug user society form treatment include health status , treatment retention , use additional methadone , cocaine use criminal involvement . Randomization Treatment Arms : Stage I : Half 202 participant randomize receive injectable diacetylmorphine , half receive injectable hydromorphone . Stage I involve 6-months treatment primary outcome change illicit heroin use prior 30 day 6 month . Stage II : All volunteer retain injection treatment end Stage I eligible enter Stage II Half participant randomize continue injection treatment exactly Stage I blind basis half switch oral equivalent medication ( diacetylmorphine hydromorphone ) . Stage II involve 6-months treatment primary outcome illicit heroin use prior 30 day 6 month randomization Stage II . Individuals complete Stage I eligible Stage II provide still receive injection medication treatment clinic . Participants exclude Stage II meet exclusion criterion may change since entry Stage I . Patients switch completely treatment abstinence Stage I randomize Stage II . Given present time DAM license drug Canada HDM substitution treatment provide drug investigation , end second study phase patient longer receive medication . Thus , study treatment provide 12 month follow period 1-month participant still treat DAM HDM taper transitioned conventional therapy methadone . From end phase two transitioning period ( 12 13 month ) next follow-up evaluation ( 18 month ) participant might receive Methadone Maintenance Therapy ( MMT ) , engage addiction treatment , abstinent untreated , use illicit opioids . The 6 12-month study visit primary outcome measure assess conduct taper transition begin . Outcomes follow-up : Patients research assessment perform pre-randomization period , baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month follow initial randomization The primary outcome measure ( POM ) Stages I II change illicit heroin use define number day illicit ( `` street '' ) heroin prior 30 day endpoint ( 6 months-Stage I , 12 months-Stage II ) mean self report . Secondary outcome measure include health status , safety study treatment , treatment retention , use additional methadone , cocaine use , urinalysis , criminal involvement , gender , ethnicity victimization , health economics quality life evaluation study blind . All self-reported outcome data collection study participant occur face-to-face , fully confidential interview set research centre . The interview conduct trained field research interviewer , part clinical treatment team , use standardized instrument . These include : Baseline follow-up European version Addiction Severity Index ( EuropASI ) ; EQ-5D ( EuroQoL ) Opioid Treatment Index ( OTI ) ; SCLR-90 ; WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II ( WHO-DAS II ) ; Maudsley Addiction Profile ( MAP ) ; Fagerstrom ; Health Utilities Index ( HUI ) well Baseline Follow-up Socio-Demographic questionnaire . The study blind evaluate blind evaluation instrument follow best practice current recommendation evaluate blind randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
