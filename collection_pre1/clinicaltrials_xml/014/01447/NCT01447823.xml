	<detailed_description>The key function esophagus ist ( ) immediate transport food bolus mouth stomach ( ii ) inhibit reflux stomach back esophagus . Motility disorder esophagus lead impaired bolus transport and/or reflux stomach content esophagus , may cause symptom ( obstructive ) dysphagia , chest pain , heart burn and/or regurgitation . Acute esophageal food impaction common acute condition upper GI tract usually need immediate medical attention . The food bolus , e.g . peace red meat similar block within tubular part esophagus , e.g . proximal esophagogastric junction neither pass spontaneously stomach regurgitate actively . In case usually require upper endoscopy endoscopic removal food bolus . Possible cause food impaction ( ) structural obstruction within esophagus Schatzki 's ring , esophageal web , peptic stenosis secondary gastroesophageal reflux disease , rarely esophageal carcinoma [ 1 , 2 ] ; ( ii ) functional cause obstruction mainly Achalasia Esophageal Esophagitis ( EE ) . In Achalasia idiopathic neurodegenerative destruction inhibitory neuron esophagus lead failure lower esophageal sphincter relax impaired esophageal peristalsis . Patients usually present history progressive dysphagia regurgitation undigested food , rarely food impaction occur [ 3 ] . Eosinophilic Esophagitis idiopathic disorder eosinophilic infiltration mucosal wall lead impaired esophageal motility , usually cause dysphagia , retrosternal pain food bolus impaction . [ 3 ] Its etiology remain unknown several study suggest allergic response food allergen . Previously believe rather rare disease therefore rare cause bolus impaction , eosinophilic esophagitis emerge one common cause food impaction dysphagia general [ 4 ] . The increase prevalence entirely clear ; besides good recognition gastroenterologist pathologists seem true increase incidence , probably due increase incidence allergic diseases [ 5 ] . Its diagnosis difficult due cause eosinophilic infiltrate gastroesophageal reflux disease eosinophilic gastroenteritis [ 3 ] . The reason impaired motility EE unknown , although several hypothetic mechanism discuss [ 6 ] : ( ) increase contraction fibroblast secondary presence eosinophilic granulocyte , ( ii ) axonal necrosis secondary eosinophilic degradation ( iii ) bind eosinophil derive MBP ( major basic protein ) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor lead increased contraction . The true prevalence eosinophilic esophagitis patient food impaction remain unknown . Desai et al evaluate 31 patient acute bolus impaction 50 % increase count intraesophageal eosinophils per high power field [ 4 ] . However , true share EE remain unclear . Especially amount patient eosinophilic infiltrate due gastroesophageal reflux define ( half patient PPI endoscopy ) . The current clinical standard care patient food bolus impaction Division Gastroenterology University Hospital Zurich include 1. endoscopy ) remove food bolus ; ii ) take esophageal , gastric duodenal biopsy assess histological abnormality iii ) assess structural cause obstruction ; 2. high resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM ) ass esophageal motility ; 3. ambulatory intraesophageal pH-monitoring ass esophageal acid exposure 4. venous blood sample assess eosinophilic count peripheral blood . These procedure consider ) necessary well ii ) sufficient accurate elucidate true cause bolus impaction [ 3 ] . Our aim objectify standard procedure care open , prospective , observational , unrandomized field study . It important mention procedure indicate situation current standard procedure care assess patient bolus impaction ; perform whether patient include field study . Therefore participation study lead additional diagnostic therapeutic procedures/interventions</detailed_description>
