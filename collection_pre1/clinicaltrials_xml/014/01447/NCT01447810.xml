	<brief_summary>Hemiplegia ( weakness poor muscle function one side body ) neurological impairment occur child result brain tumor related treatment . This impairment negatively impact child 's functional ability movement development , make difficult play , learn feed , dress bathe , participate fully home , daycare , school environment . Poor movement skill may also impact overall quality life . Constraint Induced Therapy rehabilitation technique find improve child 's ability move arm follow neurological injury like stroke traumatic brain injury adult child . The aim study evaluate feasibility implement constraint induce movement therapy program small group child brain tumor hemiplegia . Children participate program may experience improved ability use weak arm leading increase participation meaningful activity improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Constraint Induced Therapy ( CI Therapy ) base theory `` learn non-use . '' Following event impact brain ( stroke , brain injury etc . ) , message brain arm message arm brain interrupted area brain injury occur small surround area . The arm often inefficient difficult use . Over time , even swell brain decrease , movement affect arm continue effortful child become quite accustomed complete activity unaffected arm . Additionally , child use weak arm , part brain ready receive signal give command arm leg `` quiet '' work like use . The theory `` learn no-nuse '' lead development CI Therapy approach comprise following principle : - Constraint - strong normal arm/leg restrain , force use weak arm/leg treatment . - Practiced Use - weak limb treat engage child structure practice specific movement functional skill . - Transfer Package - home program develop child use caregiver focus facilitate carryover learn skill real world environment . This theory hypothesize , nervous system , particularly child , plasticity ( shape learn new thing ) , CI Therapy facilitate cortical ( brain ) reorganization , help child overcome learn non-use , eventually lead improve function weak arm leg . Phase 1 : Initial evaluation complete day 1 program . They include interview question direct assessment participant 's ability use affect arm well participate meaningful age-appropriate activity . These assessment include Motor Activity Log , The Pediatric Arm Function Test , Inventory New Motor Activities Programs , Pediatric Quality Life Inventory , Preschool Activity Card Sort Children 's Assessment Activity Preferences . Phase 2 : The participant complete intensive occupational therapy program consist 15 three-hour therapy session ( 5 day per week 3 week ) . Throughout three week program un-involved arm constrain removable cast . The cast wear 24 hour per day throughout 3 week program exception regularly schedule cast change , washing skin check complete treat occupational therapist . During direct intervention session , focus therapy facilitation new motor skill affect arm . Play utilized mean motivate pediatric participant activity exercise specifically choose facilitate new motor skill . The program also include variety tool activity caregiver complete increase adherence program outside direct intervention session facilitate transfer affect upper extremity use real world environment . Phase 3 : Immediately follow 3 week intervention program participant 's performance re-assessed . Additionally weekly follow evaluation complete phone period one month . Three month follow intervention program participant return follow evaluation .</detailed_description>

Severe hemiplegia result active range motion deficit affect upper extremity define follow : &lt; 30 degree active shoulder flexion abduction Inability initiate active elbow flexion extension . Inability initiate movement wrist , finger thumb Uncontrolled seizure interfere daily activity , would interfere participant 's ability fully participate CI Therapy program . Pain significantly interfere participant 's ability fully participate intensive therapy program . This include pain related subluxation shoulder , measure pain rating 5/10 great FACES Numeric Pain Scale . Currently receive oral intravenous chemotherapy radiation therapy .
