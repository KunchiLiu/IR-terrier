	<brief_summary>The interest study impact aquatic exercise muscle strength patient rheumatoid arthritis come publication several study point potential benefit exercise natural history disease , include reduction pain , good immune response well aerobic fitness functional capacity increase muscle strength , endurance quality life . In general , aquatic exercise indicate patient chronic joint disease , since aquatic environment seem secure population due reduction joint loading , well gain range motion . However , difficulty show real consistent beneficial effect physical activity patient , small number randomize controlled clinical trial , short intervention period ( 4-8 week ) , lack detail exercise protocol use , methodological problem ( heterogeneous measure evaluate outcome , change medication ) . Moreover , study evaluate disease activity , accord tool use clinically worldwide , DAS28 . It known aquatic exercise without impact healthy subject sufficient gain muscle strength . Nonetheless , people joint limitation benefit exercise gain muscle strength know . To date , study address effect aquatic exercise muscle strength disease activity patient rheumatoid arthritis . In addition , need obtain standardized protocol prescribe aquatic exercise . The choice lower-limb strength base relevance acceleration deceleration march , well perform activity daily live , leisure professional individual . Thus , study aim : 1 . Exercises perform aquatic environment without concomitant use overhead equipment sufficient promote gain muscle strength lower limb ? 2 . What isolate effect water resistance muscle strength ? Could work impact use exercise do land ?</brief_summary>
