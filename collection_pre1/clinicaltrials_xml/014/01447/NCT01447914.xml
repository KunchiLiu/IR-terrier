	<brief_title>Tivantinib Treating Patients With Relapsed , Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate patient relapse , relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat c-Met inhibitor ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) single agent . II . To define toxicity single agent ARQ 197 population patient relapse , relapse refractory multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary evidence durability response single agent ARQ 197 , include progression free survival ( PFS ) , duration response ( DOR ) , time next treatment ( TTNT ) . II . To correlate activation status hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) /c-Met pathway primary myeloma cell baseline , define gene expression profile reverse phase protein array data , measure efficacy ARQ 197 . III . To correlate serum marrow HGF , HGF activator ( HGFA ) , soluble c-Met ( sc-Met ) level activation status HGF/c-Met pathway primary myeloma cell baseline , measure efficacy ARQ 197 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate symptom burden relapse , relapse refractory multiple myeloma patient undergoing therapy single agent ARQ 197 use M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) multiple myeloma module ( MDASI-MM ) II . To evaluate impact therapy single agent ARQ 197 relapse , relapse refractory multiple myeloma patient report outcome use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) Core 30 ( QLQ-C30 ) , myeloma-specific module QLQ-MY20 . III . To evaluate impact therapy single agent ARQ 197 relapse , relapse refractory multiple myeloma ability collect stem cell patient go undergo subsequent stem cell mobilization . OUTLINE : Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses continue every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood , urine , bone marrow collection gene expression profile , proteomic profiling , correlative study . Patients may complete MDASI MDASI-MM , EORTC QLQ-C30 , myeloma-specific module QLQMY20 questionnaires baseline periodically study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
