	<brief_summary>The goal study understand factor may influence risk colorectal cancer family . These factor include genetic variability , combination diet lifestyle . In order achieve goal , need contact many eligible participant possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Molecular Predisposition Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ( HNPCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , single sample ( 8-10 teaspoon ) blood collect , depend upon current health status . The blood drawn MD Anderson . If come clinic , blood draw kit send home , include instruction postage-paid return express mail envelope . Phlebotomy charge connect study pay study . The blood sample send research laboratory MD Anderson analyse . If unwilling unable give blood sample , give saliva sample instead . In case , kit mail instruction obtain saliva sample . A prepaid envelope include return . Participants previously participate Protocol PA11-0567 provide blood sample need provide another blood sample . The previously store blood sample collect Protocol PA11-0567 may use . You ask answer series question . These question ask food eat either one year ago one year first diagnosis cancer . There also question cook method well overall health , vitamin medication use . Some question personal , answer keep strictly private . The questionnaire send home via U.S. express mail . It may take several hour complete survey , time limit completion . There right wrong answer question . A postage-paid return envelope provide return questionnaire . Solid tumor material colonoscopy specimens normal tissue collect participant require either colonoscopy surgery routine clinical reason . The tumor fragment collect specimen . Tissue require clinical pathology diagnosis use research purpose . This investigational study . About 2,000 patient family member take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
