	<brief_summary>The aim clinical trial test whether drug nelfinavir , increase effectiveness radiotherapy , give safely time full dose radiotherapy lung cancer . It think one way nelfinavir work cause change blood vessel within tumour . The status tumour blood vessel blood flow investigate trial use special image technique . The dose radiation use trial great use previous trial nelfinavir disease setting response normal lung combination nelfinavir plus radiation unknown . Therefore , low dose nelfinavir give first patient participate gradually increased subsequent group patient provide worrying side effect identify . There single report serious side-effects AIDs patient treat radiotherapy lung cancer also take nelfinavir . However , case nelfinavir take dose 3-fold high high dose level test trial . An important goal trial select optimum dose nelfinavir use combination lung radiotherapy , test extensively future trial . The radiotherapy treatment trial carefully design minimise amount healthy lung receive radiation . Some specialise image technique use radiotherapy planning delivery help ensure lung cancer target precisely radiation normal lung avoid much possible . One effect nelfinavir interfere function particular protein cell ( call AKT ) . The degree happen measure cell blood tissue sample . Therefore , another aim study investigate AKT related protein , check whether nelfinavir predict effect .</brief_summary>
