	<brief_title>Perioperative Pain Management In Spine Surgery Patients : Part I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spine surgery patient experience high level pain report poor pain management patient satisfaction survey . Data examine Allina HCAHPS ( Hospital Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems ) pain management question indicate spine surgery patient report poor pain management . In July , August , September 2010 patient Abbott Northwestern ( ANW ) spine surgery unit report 62 % composite pain score compare 69 % 71 % ANW overall . During three month , proportion patient unit report pain always well control range 49 % 57 % compare 59 % 64 % hospital overall . Since ANW serve high number spine surgery patient , poor pain management reporting concern patient care possibly future Medicare/Medicaid funding formula . Opioid-tolerant patient pose particular challenge pain management . The intervention test specifically targets patient determine opioid-tolerant patient . Opioid-tolerant patient generally patient severe chronic pain , , thus , take pain medication regularly . Tolerance occur chronic exposure drug diminishes analgesic effect creates need high dose maintain effect . Given severe chronic pain condition many patient present spine surgery , high level opioid tolerance among patient . While agree upon definition literature fix opioid amount constitute `` opioid tolerance , '' Abbott Northwestern Hospital work definition opioid tolerant patient receive â‰¥ 20 mg oxycodone ( equivalent ) /day &gt; 7 day . This definition slightly aggressive Institute Safe Medication Practices definition set standard `` least 30 mg oxycodone/day great week . '' While high postoperative pain status document opioid-tolerant patient , little do examine customize perioperative opioid dose improve pain management population . The propose intervention design specifically test post-operative pain management improve opioid-tolerant patient use perioperative goal-directed parenteral opioid dose base 150 % patient 's baseline oral morphine equivalent ( OME ) . It important note method perioperative goal-directed parenteral opioid dose use ANW spine surgery patient , base clinical decision anesthesiologist . However , strategy test compare standard care . For study research question : 1 . Does intervention improve immediate ( 4 hour ) post-operative pain comparison group ? 2 . Does intervention improve management 24 hour ( discharge ) recovery period comparison group ? 3 . Is clinical intervention associate select improve post-operative status measure compare control group ? 4 . Is clinical intervention associate long-term difference report pain score medication level measure phone call 4 week surgery ?</detailed_description>
