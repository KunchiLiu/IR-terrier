	<brief_summary>This research study help determine person 's genetic makeup affect response drug , ability body break drug , potential experience interaction drug . The investigator investigate drug interaction commonly use anticoagulant drug call warfarin . Warfarin use treatment prevention life-threatening abnormal blood clot deep vein thrombosis , heart attack , stroke . The investigator choose warfarin study commonly use drug must monitor closely avoid side effect . The investigator interested study whether individual certain genetic profile react differently warfarin combine drug . This research do see certain genetic profile require u adjust warfarin dos differently need general population . Genetic profile subject determine participation Pharmacogenetics Registry study ( investigator Richard Brundage , University Minnesota ) . The study hypothesis : Functionally defective CYP2C9 allele attenuate warfarin-fluconazole inhibitory interaction exacerbate warfarin-rifampin inductive interaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research question : How CYP2C9 genotype modify warfarin drug interaction ? People differ genetic makeup . This include difference gene involve drug metabolism , transport , effect body . People certain genetic profile produce alter enzyme , transporter , receptor may respond different way drug . Altered enzymes cause drug break different rate normal . As result , drug concentration build blood , increase risk side effect . Furthermore , two drug take together , possibility exists drug interact , one drug cause change metabolism drug . It know whether people alter genetic makeup also alter experience drug interaction . Altered drug transporter affect absorption elimination drug compare normal cause difference long drug stay body . Finally , alter drug receptor respond differently drug , thus , produce alter desire undesired effect . In study , investigator investigate drug interaction commonly use anticoagulant drug warfarin subject five different CYP2C9 genotype . The CYP2C9 genotype particularly important drug metabolize enzyme governs metabolic clearance potent chemical entity ( S-enantiomer ) drug . Warfarin use treatment prevention life-threatening abnormal blood clot deep vein thrombosis , myocardial infarction , stroke . The investigator choose warfarin study commonly use drug must monitor closely avoid side effect . The investigator interested study whether individual certain genetic allele CYP2C9 genotype react differently warfarin combined antifungal ( fluconazole ) inhibit CYP2C9-mediated metabolism antibiotic ( rifampin ) induce CYP2C9-mediated metabolism . This research do see certain genetic profile require u adjust warfarin dos differently need general population . The study hypothesis : Functionally defective CYP2C9 allele attenuate warfarin-fluconazole inhibitory interaction exacerbate warfarin-rifampin inductive interaction .</detailed_description>
