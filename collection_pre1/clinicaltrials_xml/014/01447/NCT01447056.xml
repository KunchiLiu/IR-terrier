	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph node cancer call lymphoma , tumor nasal passage call nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , tumor particular type muscle call leiomyosarcoma ( LMS ) condition call severe chronic active EBV ( SCAEBV ) syndrome . The disease come back , may come back go away treatment . This voluntary research study use special immune system cell call LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes , new experimental therapy . Some patient disease show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis ( call Epstein-Barr virus , EBV ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell half patient lymphomas , case NPC LMS , suggest may play role cause disease . Those cancer cell ( well B cell SCAEBV ) infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . We want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill cell infect EBV survive blood affect tumor . This treatment specially trained T cell activity viruses cell make patient disease ( , bone marrow transplant , patient 's transplant donor ) . However , sometimes possible grow cell ; time , may take 2 3 month make cell , may long one active tumor . We therefore ask subject would like participate study , test blood cell donor partial match subject ( transplant donor ) grown way describe survive blood affect disease . These LMP-specific CTLs investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Most Closely HLA-Matched CTLs Relapsed Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) -Associated Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First , search cell bank see CTL line match subject his/her donor . This match do use HLA type , measure 6 protein cell surface . If HLA type previously check , blood draw ( half one tablespoon ) do . These CTL line make Baylor College Medicine donor transplant patient normal donor National Marrow Donor Program . All donor screen way screen blood donor . When CTL line make , blood take donor use grow T cell . To , first grow special type cell call dendritic cell monocytes put specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry LMP gene dendritic cell monocyte . They use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP surface . We grow LMP specific CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell ( make blood ) . We also put adenovirus carry LMP gene EBV infect cell increase amount LMP cell . These EBV infect cell treat radiation could grow . Once make sufficient number T cell , test make sure kill cell LMP surface froze . To make sure cell wo n't attack subject 's tissue , also test cell his/her cell , grow laboratory . If level circulate T-cells patient relatively high , s/he receive one treatment cyclophosphamide . This drug decrease number patient 's T-cells investigator infuse LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes . If patient already receive chemotherapy , may need . The LMP specific CTLs thaw injected IV 1-10 minute . Initially , one dose T-cells give . If first dose , reduction size patient 's disease , receive five additional dos T-cells wish . This dose escalation study , mean dos cell increase patient treat , long low dos determine safe .</detailed_description>
