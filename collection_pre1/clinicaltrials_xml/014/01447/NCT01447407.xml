	<detailed_description>Preclinical study mice establish several member Als family protein induce protective immune response mouse allow high survival rate follow challenge highly virulent dos either Candida S. aureus . Als3 ( antigen NDV-3 investigational vaccine ) effective member Als protein family protect mouse challenge either Candida S. aureus . The first Phase 1 study enrol 40 healthy subject receive placebo ( N=10 ) , 1 dose ( N=30 ) 2 dos ( N=19 ) NDV-3 vaccine administer IM . The vaccine well tolerate highly immunogenic . This study evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity one dose NDV-3 vaccine formulate without alum give IM also low dose without alum give ID . Subjects follow-up visit ass safety tolerability immune response select time point 90 day post-vaccination .</detailed_description>
