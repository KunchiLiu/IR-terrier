	<brief_summary>Background : Clopidogrel , potent inhibitor adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet activation , widely use prevent reduce risk thrombotic event . Objective : aim present study evaluate bioequivalence two oral formulation 75 mg clopidogrel tablet . Method : The study open , randomize , single-dose , two-period crossover trial conduct 32 healthy Mexican volunteer fast state . A single oral dose test reference drug follow 7 day washout period , subject receive alternative formulation . Blood sample collect 24 h dosing . In order determine bioequivalence , plasma concentration clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolite determine use high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry area plasma concentration time curve zero last quantifiable level ( AUC0-t ) , area plasma concentration time curve extrapolate infinity ( AUC0-∞ ) , maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , plasma elimination half-life ( Tmax ) plasma half-life ( T1/2 ) calculate formulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedure In period , subject arrive clinical/unit site day commencement study randomize use Excel® 2007 receive test formulation follow reference formulation , viceversa . No food allow 10 h least 4 h drug administration . On subsequent morning , peripheral venous 21G catheter insert antecubital vein subject blood sample collect ( zero time ) . The subject receive single 75 mg tablet either test reference formulation , give 250 mL water . Blood sample collect 0.16 , 0.33 , 0.5 , 0.66 , 0.83 , 1 , 1.5 , 1.75 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 h drug administration . The blood sample collect coded EDTA tube plasma obtain centrifugation ( 2,053 g 10 min 5 C ) , plasma immediately transfer prelabeled vial store -70 After week washout , alternative formulation administer subject sample draw analyze .</detailed_description>
