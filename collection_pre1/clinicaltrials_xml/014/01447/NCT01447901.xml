	<brief_summary>LPL ( Lipoprotein Lipase ) enzyme play important role elimination triglyceride ( fat ) clearance dietary fat particle know chylomicron ( CM ) blood . In patient abnormal LPL gene , enzyme work ( total , hereditary LPL deficiency ) , result large increase amount triglyceride ( fat ) chylomicron blood . This increase risk inflammation pancreas lead long term negative effect blood vessel ( atherosclerosis ) . Current medication / strict low fat diet sufficiently reduce level triglyceride order prevent condition . To solve problem , company , AMT develop gene therapy ( AMT-011 ) . In normal healthy individual , fat particle rapidly clear circulation follow standard meal . Within approximately 3 hour high level fat reach clearance achieve within subsequent 9 hour . In LPLD subject , clearance fat greatly reduce direct consequence lack LPL . During study , standard meal tracer ( 3H-palmitate ) give . Since palmitate incorporate dietary fat , study enable monitoring appearance newly form dietary fat into- clearance newly form dietary fat circulation , time . The principal aim study verify gene therapy ( AMT 011 ) still effective treatment condition . Systemic appearance clearance new form dietary fat particle ingestion meal determine measure level tracer different time point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lipoprotein lipase deficiency ( LPLD ) rare autosomal recessive inherit disorder cause loss-of-function mutation lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) gene . It common genetic cause hyperchylomicronaemia , condition result continuous excessively high level plasma chylomicron ( CM ) severe hypertriglyceridaemia . Lipoprotein lipase normally mediate hydrolysis triglyceride ( TG ) CMs low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) thereby aids clearance TG-rich lipoproteins reduction TGs circulation . Alipogene tiparvovec ( Glybera® ) development therapy LPLD . In summary , alipogene tiparvovec contain human lipoprotein ( LPL ) gene variant LPLS447X non-replicating vector solution administer one-time series intramuscular injection arms/legs.The aim alipogene tiparvovec ( Glybera® ) administration provide LPL activity stimulate CM metabolism LPLD patient . To test activity LPL subject previously treat alipogene tiparvovec study LPLD subject give radiolabeled meal supplement labeled tracer , 3H-palmitate . Since dietary palmitate incorporate CMs form enterocytes gut , enable monitor appearance subsequent clearance newly form CMs circulation time , so-called `` postprandial test '' . The radiolabeled meal provide liquid form similar milkshake . After ingestion radiolabeled meal , level radiolabel CM fraction different time point prior postprandial phase measure thus determine appearance clearance CMs within circulation . The principal aim study increase understand long alipogene tiparvovec may effective treatment LPLD . To understand , 3 cohort subject study : 1 ) Subjects LPLD previously treat alipogene tiparvovec ; 2 ) Subjects LPLD treat alipogene tiparvovec ; 3 ) Subjects LPLD ( healthy volunteer ) . The subject 's general state health also monitor clinical study , possible disadvantage associate postprandial test assess .</detailed_description>
