	<detailed_description>In obese patient type 2 diabetes mellitus , lifestyle modification result weight loss improve even normalize blood glucose . This beneficial effect glucose control account improvement insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . However , metabolic effect caloric restriction per se may , least part , independent body weight reduction . Furthermore , improve control blood glucose type 2 diabetes low calorie diet ( VLCD ) 40 day document first 10 day caloric restriction , weight loss still trivial . When caloric intake increase weight reduction , plasma glucose increase spite weight rebound . The mechanism ( ) underlie early improvement cause VLCD patient type 2 diabetes assessed study . Thus , fall hepatic glucose production modest increase insulin sensitivity report early 7 day low calorie diet . A subsequent study replicate effect short term VLCD hepatic glucose production , whole body insulin sensitivity . As beta cell function , early study report apparent improvement insulin secretion rate oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , short-term application VLCD . However , formal investigation beta cell sensitivity glucose perform , , since glucose give per o , factor ( e.g . incretins , ghrelin ) might involve . One study report improvement beta cell response hyperglycemic clamp , i.e . exclude gut related factor , 8 week VLCD weight stabilization period , i.e . absence negative energy balance signal . Furthermore , study design , explore first phase secretory response glucose . Quite recently , Lim coll . report , patient type 2 diabetes , VLCD markedly improve glucose control day , amelioration liver insulin sensitivity beta cell sensitivity glucose mechanism primarily involve . Prolongation VLCD 8 week lead apparent remission diabetes . This early mechanistic study perform patient BMI around 30-35 , , accord current guideline , metabolic surgery consider treatment option . In patient type 2 diabetes undergo bariatric surgery , improvement glucose control beta cell function detectable significant weight loss occur , strong suggestion intestinal bypass procedure may metabolic effect ( e.g . beta cell ) independent effect body weight , possibly involve incretin axis . Furthermore , remission rate type 2 diabetes follow bariatric surgery high 70-80 % report . Thus , would important know whether severely obese patient type 2 diabetes , potential candidate metabolic surgery , short term VLCD exert effect similar report less obese patient . The investigator therefore perform preliminary proof-of-concept study ass whether severely obese patient type 2 diabetes 7 day VLCD affect glucose control change either beta cell function insulin sensitivity . Participants study baseline 7 day caloric restriction ( VLCD ) . VLCD consist 400 kcal/day diet , percentage distribution lipid , protein carbohydrate , accord Italian Standards Care . Both baseline end VLCD , hyperglycemic insulin clamp study perform patient , previously describe . All study carry 08.00 , 12-hour overnight fast , subject lie bed , last 180 ' . In subject two intravenous catheter insert ante-cubital vein ( retrogradely ) wrist vein substance infusion sample arterialize blood , respectively , accord hot box technique . After 60 min period establish baseline ( -60'- 0 ' ) , time 0 ' hyperglycemic glucose clamp carry follow 120 ' , previously describe . Plasma glucose measure bedside every 2'-5 ' need clamp 7.0 mmol/L ( 126 mg/dl ) baseline value . Under condition constant hyperglycemia , normal beta cell secretory response biphasic early burst insulin release within first 10 minute ( first phase ) , follow later monotonically increase hormone release ( second phase ) . Blood sample glucose , C-peptide insulin determination draw every 2.5 min 0 15 min every 15 min 15 120 min . The acute insulin response ( AIR ) calculate average incremental plasma insulin concentration 2.5 , 5.0 , 7.5 10 min hyperglycemic clamp . Second phase insulin response ( 2ndIR ) compute average incremental insulin concentration 60 ' 120 ' hyperglycemic clamp . Glucose disposal clamp compute rate exogenous glucose infusion correct ( minimal ) change glucose pool ( M value ; unit : µmol.min-1.m-2 BSA ) . The metabolic clearance rate glucose clamp compute ratio M value prevalent glucose concentration . Under experimental condition , metabolic clearance rate glucose direct experimental measurement Disposition Index second phase insulin secretion ( DI ; unit : ml . min-1.m-2 BSA ) , whole body use glucose achieve beta cell experimentally fix glucose concentration . It measure whole body capability dispose intravenous glucose load , reflect beta cell adequacy adjust prevail insulin resistance insulin clearance . This DI two advantage : 1 . It direct experimental measure , product two different experimental assessment ; 2 . At variance DIs , require assumption regard mathematical relationship link insulin sensitivity beta cell secretory response glucose-stimulated insulin concentration . Insulin sensitivity hyperglycemic clamp calculate ratio metabolic clearance rate glucose divide average insulin concentration achieve 60 ' 120 ' ( IS ; unit : [ ( ml . min-1.m-2 BSA ) / ( pmol/L ) ] . The analysis glucose C-peptide curve hyperglycemic clamp follow general strategy propose several laboratory slight modification , previously describe detail . The main output model : 1 . First phase parameter - Total amount insulin secrete due first phase ( 1stISR ; unit : pmol.m-2 BSA ) - Glucose sensitivity first phase secretion ( σ1 ) , express amount insulin secrete response rate increase glucose concentration 1 mmol/liter time 0 1 min study ( unit : [ ( pmol.m-2 BSA ) / ( mM.min-1 ) ] 2 . Second phase parameter - Total amount insulin secrete due second phase ( 2ndISR ; unit : pmol.m-2 BSA ) ; - Glucose sensitivity second-phase secretion ( σ2 ) , express steady-state insulin secretion rate response step increase glucose concentration 1 mmol/liter baseline ( unit : [ ( pmol.min-1.m-2 BSA/ ( mmol/L ) ] . Finally , index insulin clearance ( InsClearIndex ; unit : L.min-1.m-2 BSA ) calculate ratio average insulin secretion rate divide average insulin concentration hyperglycemic clamp .</detailed_description>
