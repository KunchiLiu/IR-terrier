	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize ( 1:1 ) , control study assess clinical status , quality life , healthcare cost parental retention rate asthma knowledge child 5 12 year old asthma , follow standardized asthma education versus standard education enhance reinforcement education intervention . Group A ( intervention group ) The caregiver subject enrol group administer two survey instrument enrollment ( t0 ) , via telephone 2 week ( t1 ) , 1 month ( t2 ) , 3 month ( t3 ) enrollment . This group also receive reinforce asthma education via telephone 2 week , 1 month , 3 month enrollment . Group B ( control group ) The caregiver subject enrol group administer two survey instrument enrollment ( t0 ) , via telephone 2 week ( t1 ) , 1 month ( t2 ) , 3 month ( t3 ) enrollment . This group receive reinforce asthma education 2 week , 1 month , 3 month enrollment . The two survey instrument administer caregiver ( parents/legal guardian ) subject enrol study consist : 1 . A validated 16-item questionnaire multiple-choice answer , assess asthma knowledge , trigger identification avoidance , refer `` Asthma Knowledge Quiz '' . 2 . A validated 5-item questionnaire multiple-choice answer , assess patient 's quality life asthma control , refer `` Quality Life/Asthma Control Test ( QOL/ACT ) survey '' . Following enrollment randomization , caregiver subject administer two survey instrument prior discharge hospital . At end administration phone survey ( i.e . 2 week , 1 month 3 month follow enrollment ) , study coordinator provide reinforce asthma education caregiver via telephone subject enrol Group A ( intervention group ) . The reinforced asthma education consistent asthma education training session deliver AE begin study . The survey instrument administer caregiver study coordinator paper form ; completion caregiver , form save subject 's research binder data analysis . The PI study coordinator determine score item survey , record score subject 's file , Asthma Knowledge Quiz Scores/Asthma Knowledge Retention Rates Form , Quality Life/Asthma Control Test ( QOL/ACT ) Scores Form respectively . The caregiver subject administer two survey instrument , via telephone , study coordinator , 2 week , 1 month , 3 month enrollment . Each item multiple-choice answer literally read parent phone , study coordinator record answer item paper survey form , save subject 's binder data analysis . The PI study coordinator determine score survey , record score subject 's file . A variety statistical technique use analyze data . The investigator perform descriptive analysis well analytic work use analysis variance , correlation multiple regression analysis . The investigator use expertise biostatistician assist accurate analysis data . The study power detect significant difference outcome intervention group ( group A ) control group ( group B ) ; 25 % reduction cost 25 % improvement quality life score , follow reinforce asthma education , 95 % CI ( alpha=0.05 , beta=0.2 , power 80 % ) . The investigator also analyze whether statistically significant correlation amplitude asthma knowledge score ( AKS ) asthma knowledge retention rate ( AKRR ) one side QOL/ACT score , functional status asthma relate healthcare cost side .</detailed_description>
