	<brief_summary>Although frequently mention medium overweight obesity reach epidemic proportion worldwide country , Canadians perplex sometimes confused role obesity diabetes heart disease . In fact , investigator even hear time time could `` healthy '' obese individual . In clinical practice , assessment obesity risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain challenge even physician confuse . However , study conduct laboratory research team around world last 20 year clearly show body shape important body size evaluate risk overweight/obesity high accumulation abdominal fat ( excess belly fat ) increase risk diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The investigator need good understand link excess belly fat atherosclerosis ( thicken artery wall fatty deposit , also refer atherosclerotic plaque ) , lead complication angina ( chest pain ) myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . Using non-invasive imaging technique magnetic resonance imaging , investigator therefore propose examine relationship measure fatness abdominal fat size atherosclerotic plaque large blood vessel apparently healthy human subject . This study also unique opportunity look , first time , relationship belly fat , blood sugar , several well-known risk factor heart disease ( cholesterol , blood pressure , cardiorespiratory fitness , etc . ) size atherosclerotic plaque . This research program pave way development new improve preventive/therapeutic approach focus body weight rather abdominal fat associate blood abnormality predictive development atherosclerotic plaque lead premature development heart disease .</brief_summary>
