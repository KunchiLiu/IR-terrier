	<brief_summary>The investigator plan recruit 140 patient ( 35 subject group ) period 18 month prospective study matched/paired case-control subject across four group measure 5-year risk develop DM2 group knowledge 5-year risk develop diabetes affect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) compliance . The study four arm : 1 ) patient newly-diagnosed OSA require CPAP therapy without diabetes give result diabetes risk score ; 2 ) patient newly-diagnosed OSA require CPAP therapy without diabetes give result diabetes risk score ; 3 ) age , sex , BMI-matched control without OSA diabetes ; 4 ) age , sex , BMI , OSA severity match patient CPAP therapy OSA . The investigator document patient compliant CPAP base review SD card data record CPAP machine . Each patient serum drawn biomarker panel well standard diagnostic measure DM2 ( oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) upon enrollment study . An Epworth Sleepiness Score , BMI , neck waist circumference , smoke history , blood pressure , standard vital sign also collect . There follow-up study subject group 3 4 participation study complete Visit 1 . Groups 1 2 follow 6 month enrollment ass whether change CPAP compliance measure SD card .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Risk Developing Type II Diabetes Using Serum Biomarkers Patients Diagnosed With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 140 subject recruit ( 35 subject newly-diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) without diabetes tell 5-year risk develop diabetes mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) prior start CPAP therapy , 35 subject newly-diagnosed OSA without diabetes tell 5-year risk develop DM2 prior start continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy , 35 healthy subject without OSA diabetes , 35 subject OSA &gt; 12 month CPAP therapy ) . The patient newly-diagnosed OSA need assess require CPAP therapy treat physician . The investigator use `` A '' ( ex : A001 ) subject number subject newly-diagnosed OSA require CPAP therapy without diabetes give result diabetes risk score ( group 1 ) ; `` B '' ( ex : B001 ) subject number subject newly-diagnosed OSA require CPAP therapy without diabetes give result diabetes risk score ( group 2 ) . The investigator use `` C '' ( ex : C001 ) subject number healthy subject ( age , sex , BMI-matched control ) without OSA diabetes ( group 3 ) . The investigator use `` D '' ( ex : D001 ) subject number ( age , sex , BMI , OSA severity match ) patient CPAP therapy OSA ( group 4 ) . Screening Visit : - Obtain sign Informed Consent document HIPAA Authorization ( research-driven ) - Women child bear potential serum pregnancy test ( 5-10 milliliter ( ml ) , approximately 1-2 teaspoon blood ) ( research-driven ) . - Review sleep study data SD card ( flash memory card ) data appropriate ass good CPAP compliance define average daily use &gt; = 4 hour least 5 days/week 30 day precede enrollment ( standard care ) - Patients tell fast least 10 hour prior Visit 1 . Visit 1 ( Day 1 ) : ( see attach Data Collection Form ) - Patients follow blood test drawn include : - Biomarker Panel ( PreDxTM Diabetes Risk Score ) , ( 5-10 ml , approximately 2-4 teaspoon blood per blood draw ) ( research-driven ) Group 3 &amp; 4 show sample PreDx Diabetes Risk Report explain . Their report mail along brochure `` A Guide Understanding Your PreDx Diabetes Risk Score ( DRS ) '' . - 2-hour OGTT via 2 venipuncture ( 5-10 ml , approximately 2-4 teaspoon blood per blood draw ) ( research-driven ) - Obtain Epworth Sleepiness Score , age , sex , race , height , weight , BMI , neck waist circumference , smoke history , blood pressure heart rate ( research-driven ) - Patients group 1 &amp; 2 tell fast least 10 hour prior Visit 2 . There follow-up study patient Groups 3 4 participation study complete Visit 1 . Visit 1 Follow-Up ( Group 1 ONLY ) • Patients come personalize PreDx Diabetes Risk Report explain . They give brochure `` A Guide Understanding Your PreDx Diabetes Risk Score ( DRS ) '' . Groups 1 2 Visit 2 6 month assess CPAP compliance via SD card review . Visit 2 ( 180 day Visit 1 Follow Up ) Groups 1 2 : ( see attach Data Collection Form ) - Patients Groups 1 2 assess - Review sleep study data SD card ( flash memory card ) data appropriate ass CPAP compliance last 30 day ( standard care ) - Patients follow blood test drawn include : Biomarker Panel ( PreDxTM Diabetes Risk Score ) , ( 5-10 ml , approximately 2-4 teaspoon blood per blood draw ) ( research-driven ) - Obtain Epworth Sleepiness Score , weight , BMI , neck waist circumference , smoke history , blood pressure heart rate ( research-driven ) Visit 2 Follow-Up ( Groups 1 2 ) : • Patients come personalize PreDx Diabetes Risk Report explain . They give brochure `` A Guide Understanding Your PreDx Diabetes Risk Score ( DRS ) '' . Subjects tell result 2-hour OGTT PCM . Patients group 1 &amp; 2 , participation end Visit 2 Follow-Up . Patients group 3 &amp; 4 , participation end Visit 1 . All patient receive standard care treatment regardless participation research study . If time study , subject OSA decide withdraw study , refer Primary Care Manager ( PCM ) continue standard care treatment . If healthy subject decide withdraw study , follow require . Subjects pregnant exclude study change woman 's hormone pregnancy may bias result blood work . Also , woman breastfeed may participate study . Study subject tell Epworth Sleepiness Score within normal ( 0-9 ) abnormal ( 10-24 ) range ; subject abnormal Epworth score instruct follow-up PCM . If healthy subject decide withdraw study , follow require . If subject diagnose diabetic pre-diabetic part study , refer PCM standard care treatment . If patient withdraw study , test part study require . If patient decide withdraw study , remain portion blood sample destroy . However , data already obtain researcher sample continue use research purpose discuss protocol . Diabetes Risk Score ( Pre Dx DRS ) The PreDx DRS test sample collect follow : Tethys Biosciences send prepared collection kit pack material . Blood drawn 2 tube contain 8.5 mL 4 mL respectively lab personnel patient fast 10 hour , require one venipuncture . The collection kit assign de-identified number . We keep locked master list code number associate patient 's identification . The collected blood process store accord manufacturers'specifications . The lab kit ship Tethys Biosciences within 7 day . From sample , Tethys Bioscience measure 7 predictive biomarkers -Adiponectin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Ferritin , Glucose , Insulin , IL-2 HbA1c . Using proprietary algorithm risk score calculate . In order calculate risk score , Tethys need patient ' date birth gender addition fast blood sample . The PreDx DRS model provide continuous measure risk progress DM2 within five year . There three risk stratum , low risk define PreDx DRS &lt; 4.5 , moderate risk PreDx DRS ≥4.5 &lt; 8.0 , high risk PreDx DRS ≥8.0 . Tethys Bioscience send result PreDx DRS test Clinical Research Coordinator . The Tethys Biosciences Clinical Laboratory Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify use procedure process Laboratory specimen mention research project . This test develop performance characteristic determine Tethys Clinical Laboratory . The result intend used sole mean clinical diagnosis patient management decision .</detailed_description>
