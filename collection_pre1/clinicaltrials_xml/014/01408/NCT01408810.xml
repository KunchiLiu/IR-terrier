	<brief_title>Evaluation Histologic Endoscopic Remission Induced Infliximab Moderate Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Correlations histologic disease activity assessments clinical disease activity well establish despite good correlation find endoscopy histology , especially active ulcerative colitis ( 1,2 ) . Endoscopic heal induced infliximab Crohn 's disease patient associate significant reduction surgery hospitalization ( 3 ) . Histological recovery ulcerative colitis often incomplete study show microscopic evidence inflammation common even patient clinically quiescent colitis assess sigmoidoscopy ( 4,5 ) . Although fact yet completely elucidate , suggest patient residual microscopic acute inflammation may prone relapse ( 2 ) . The prognostic importance microscopic inflammation unknown . Given rectum always involve ulcerative colitis inflammatory activity diffuse restrict mucosa , collection sample rectal sigmoid mucosa potentially useful tool evaluate disease severity . In addition , strong correlation level calprotectin degree inflammation assess endoscopic histologic criterion ( 6 ) . Therefore , measurement faecal calprotectin lactoferrin may also provide valuable non-invasive tool assess disease activity optimize treatment UC patient . Histologically , active disease define presence neutrophil conjunction epithelial cell damage . Analysis generally rely examination H &amp; E-stained section . Two sample suggest appropriated well-known treatment may induce variation expression inflammation intensity . Several histological score propose , however , Geboes index ( 7 ) validate tested reproducibility 5 domain : structural change , chronic inflammatory infiltrate , lamina propria neutrophil eosinophil , neutrophil epithelium , crypt destruction erosion ulceration . The Geboes index elaborate grade crypt lesion surface epithelial damage propose index . The aim study ass relationship microscopic Geboes index inflammation clinical course ulcerative colitis patient treat infliximab . The investigator propose test hypothesis infliximab able induce histological remission change clinical course ulcerative colitis</detailed_description>
