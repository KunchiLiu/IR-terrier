	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential high dos rifampin ( RIF ) shorten treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) without cause adverse event . The hypothesis high dos RIF result high blood concentration RIF ; high blood concentration result tuberculosis bug kill quickly ; , happen without adverse event . Patients active , infectious , drug-susceptible TB agree participate randomly assign 1 3 dos RIF . All patient also receive standard dos regular ( 3 ) companion drug 2 month daily , supervise therapy . The study ass follow among 3 study arm ( oral dos RIF 10 , 15 &amp; 20 mg/kg/day ) initial 8 week treatment : 1 ) amount RIF blood least 14 day treatment ; 2 ) difference number tuberculosis bug kill ; 3 ) frequency adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial High-Dose Rifampin Patients With TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , multi-site , dose-ranging trial compare 3 dos RIF multidrug regimen treatment smear-positive , pulmonary TB . The intervention phase prospective , randomize , double-blinded trial last 8 week , duration standard `` intensive '' phase short-course chemotherapy TB . During time , subject receive follow companion drug : isoniazid ( INH , 5 mg/kg/day ) , ethambutol ( EMB , 20 mg/kg/day ) , pyrazinamide ( PZA , 25 mg/kg/day ) , pyridoxine ( 50 mg ) , standard dos use treatment . Subjects also randomize receive one follow weight-based dos study drug , rifampin ( RIF ) : 10 mg/kg/day ( standard dose , control ) , 15 mg/kg/day ( intervention 1 ) , 20 mg/kg/day ( intervention 2 ) . All patient receive least standard dose RIF , efficacy multidrug-treatment TB well established . Placebo use control additional RIF capsule provide intervention arm . Subjects , clinician , laboratory staff blind study arm . All patient weight band receive total number tablet ( fixed-dose combination plus RIF and/or placebo ) . Blinding essential reduce probability bias report adverse event . After randomization , covariates may result heterogeneity within stratum ( e.g. , presence cavitation , HIV serostatus ) , adjust analysis . It important maintain ability measure effect ( ) potential characteristic treatment outcome . If stratify characteristic , could estimate confounding ( interaction ) effect . All dos deliver orally fully supervise . All patient receive weight-based dos fixed-dose combination accord package insert . This supplement active RIF capsule placebos , , accord weight treatment arm . They also receive 50 mg pyridoxine prevent peripheral neuropathy , common side effect INH .</detailed_description>
