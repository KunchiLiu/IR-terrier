	<brief_title>Subtotal Versus Total Thyroidectomy Graves ' Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graves ' disease first described 1835 . It autoimmune disorder cause antibody bind thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) receptor thyroid cell membrane . The overt clinical manifestation disease usually characterise presence hyperthyroidism , thyroid associate ophthalmopathy thyroid dermopathy . Treatment alternative Graves ' disease include antithyroid medication , radioiodine therapy thyroidectomy . The antithyroid medication often use initial treatment patient newly diagnose Graves disease much world include Europe , Japan South America . However , use radioiodine common first-line treatment modality United States . Thyroidectomy consider special circumstance child young adult , pregnant woman , set ophthalmopathy , presence thyroid nodules big goitre , particularly compressive symptom , substernal thyroid extension diagnose , well case fail hyperthyroidism remission antithyroid medication patient refuse possible radioiodine treatment . The surgical management Graves ' disease remain controversial . Some author support total thyroidectomy others prefer various subtotal procedure . Most low-volume surgeon avoid perform total thyroidectomy Graves ' disease owe assume high complication rate . On hand , increase number total thyroidectomy currently perform high-volume endocrine surgery unit , indication procedure include high-risk thyroid cancer , also Graves 's disease multinodular goiter . It show total thyroidectomy Graves ' disease lower almost zero disease recurrence rate . However , issue like unclear benefit natural course Graves ' ophthalmopathy balance assume high risk morbidity follow radical thyroid resection need clarify . We hypothesize total thyroidectomy superior bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy long-term control Graves ' disease . The aim study evaluate long-term result bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy versus total thyroidectomy patient mild active Graves ' ophthalmopathy .</detailed_description>
