	<detailed_description>The propose project test limit number rural semi-rural site state Kansas innovative model synchronous ( `` live '' ) Internet initiation intensification daily basal insulin glargine detemir type 2 diabetic patient deploy statewide subsequent large study ( R18 ) . The study 's specific aim 1 ) develop synchronous ( `` live '' ) interactive Internet-administered course design teach group type 2 diabetic patient safely administer basal insulin without significant support usual source diabetic management self-adjust dose achieve HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % use treat-to-target algorithm ; 2 ) ass Internet patient select clinical psychometric outcome . These include HbA1c , frequency severity hypoglycemia , psychological resistance insulin treatment , diabetes quality life , treatment satisfaction . The study build upon finding Treat-to-Target INITIATE trial , well successful Internet intervention weight management , lay conceptual foundation gather expertise successfully apply R18 , primary aim address delay insulin therapy document DAWN study cost effectiveness analysis Internet intervention . The study hop show Internet teach basal insulin therapy comparable traditional insulin management respect safety effectiveness measure expect ( publish ) result frequency hypoglycemia percent patient reach target . Psychometric outcome exploratory - hypothesis generate respect subsequent R18 application .</detailed_description>
