	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins give together cytarabine treat patient B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia come back period improvement ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Immunotoxins , deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins , find certain cancer cell kill without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins cytarabine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Combotox ( deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins ) add high-dose cytarabine salvage therapy adult patient relapse refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy regimen . II . To assess presence postulate CD34+/CD38-/low/CD19+ leukemic stem cell phenotype bone marrow time relapse ass association treatment outcome . III . To determine development human mouse ricin antibody ( human anti-mouse antibody [ HAMA ] /human anti-ricin antibody [ HARA ] ) . IV . To determine pharmacokinetic characteristic Combotox . V. To evaluate value fractional excretion sodium ( FeNa ) early marker toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins . Patients receive high-dose cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) 2-3 hour every 12 hour day 1-3 deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins IV 4 hour day 8 , 10 , 12 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
