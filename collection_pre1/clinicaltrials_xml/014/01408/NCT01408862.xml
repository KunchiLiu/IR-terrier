	<brief_summary>Novel drug treatment patient diabetes interest cardiologist reduce risk cardiovascular event . However , document current discussion potential benefit glitazones , high hope fail . Initial beneficial cardiovascular effect show proof-of-concept study mute apparent high mortality metaanalysis study rosiglitazone . The rapidly increase use GLP-1 analogue DPP-4 ( Dipeptidyl protease 4 ) inhibitor treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus may major interest cardiologist . Potential beneficial action cardiovascular system far show animal experiment small proof concept study may provide rationale use drug specifically diabetic patient secondary complication macrovascular disease diabetic cardiomyopathy . Theoretically , new therapy could also proof beneficial patient heart failure , independently concomitant diabetes mellitus . However , many unanswered question need address near future extend experimental finding potential benefit real life patient . In summary new class antidiabetic drug , could possibly directly influence cardiovascular effect diabetes mellitus thus possibly treat even prevent life threaten complication become available . Then work hypothesis incretins may desirable cardiovascular outcome modulate platelet function . In order test hypothesis propose ass presence specific receptor isolate human platelet . In addition , propose sudy effect endogenous incretins ( glucagon-like peptide 1 gastric inhibitory peptide ) human platelet function isolate test tube .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims Methods : The prevalence Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) continue increase globally bring parallel increase associate cardiovascular disease complication . Correction platelet hyperactivity hold promise high-risk population T2D patient contribute restore normal hemostasis , lead search new antiagregant drug . Then , aim study whether incretins may modulate platelet function ; purpose platelet healthy subject take medication study . Besides , normal mature megakaryocyte obtain culture human cord blood derived-CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell also study . For platelet function study , platelet aggregation test absence presence different concentration ( 10-9 M 10-5 M ) glucagon-like peptide-1 , GLP1- ( 7-36 ) NH2 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) agonist turbidimetricassay . The effect 300 mg/dLglucose add medium also evaluate . GLP1R ( glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ) GIPR ( GIP receptor ) mRNA expression evaluate Real Time PCR platelet megakaryocyte total mRNA . The putative presence protein assay western blot flow cytometry sample .</detailed_description>
