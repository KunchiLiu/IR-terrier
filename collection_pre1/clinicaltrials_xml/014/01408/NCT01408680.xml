	<brief_summary>The investigator believe relieve oxidative stress experience hemodialysis patient may help improve cardiovascular health . In study , investigator hypothesize administration coenzyme Q10 , target antioxidant therapy , ameliorate excessive oxidative stress experience hemodialysis patient . This lead improvement biomarkers : - oxidative stress status - inflammatory status - endothelial dysfunction</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 400,000 patient receive dialysis United States , investigator expect number go . For hemodialysis , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) account large part health problem patient . Cardiovascular problem come damage heart blood vessel . At present , investigator treatment proven help prevent CVD dialysis . For general population , investigator know many factor increase risk CVD , high level `` bad '' cholesterol . But people dialysis , investigator believe risk factor important development CVD . People dialysis often high blood level waste product . This call `` uremia '' . The investigator believe uremia set chemical reaction blood lead hardening artery ( atherosclerosis ) , important part CVD . Compounds call antioxidant , stop chemical reaction , may help prevent CVD . Coenzyme Q10 naturally occur compound blood tissue . It also readily available dietary supplement often use alternative medicine . It strong antioxidant . The investigator already know blood level coenzyme Q10 low hemodialysis patient . Because , important u find give coenzyme Q10 hemodialysis patient help prevent CVD . In addition , many people take medication call `` statin '' help reduce risk cardiovascular disease . The investigator know statins low coenzyme Q10 . It important u know hemodialysis patient take statin low level coenzyme Q10 . It may take coenzyme Q10 could increase good effect statin medication hemodialysis patient . This study last long enough u look development CVD subject . But investigator able look biomarkers oxidative stress , systemic inflammation , endothelial function . The investigator know biomarkers tell u uremia harmful chemical reaction blood . If coenzyme Q10 improve biomarkers , investigator believe also help prevent CVD hemodialysis patient . Our goal improvement cardiovascular risk hemodialysis .</detailed_description>
