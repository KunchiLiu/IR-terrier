	<brief_summary>The investigator research patient diseases plasma cell order improve quality length life . The investigator create database patient information , blood sample , bone marrow tissue order achieve follow three goal : - Surveillance : The investigator want track treatment patient get n't get , effective , feel , complication suffer , long stay remission , long live . - Contact : Because myeloma amyloidosis rare , less 700 patient diagnosed state Ohio year , patient often feel n't accurate information . The investigator want provide access clinical team ( phone email consultation , even office visit patient come Columbus ) well information regard informational event pertain disease local support group . - Research : Because nearly myeloma amyloid patient relapse treatment eventually unsuccessful , focus develop effective treatment prolong life , cure disease . Periodically investigator inform clinical trial study new drug treatment paradigm .</brief_summary>
