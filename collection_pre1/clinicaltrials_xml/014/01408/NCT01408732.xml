	<brief_title>Office-sclerotherapy Epistaxis Due Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety percent patient suffer Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia ( HHT ) experience epistaxis range mild recurrent , severe , life threaten episode . Current method treat significant epistaxis limitation , namely need general anesthesia repeat treatment . The objective study test novel tolerable office-based treatment method , sclerotherapy sodium tetradecyl sulfate ( STS ) , recurrent epistaxis relate HHT . Sclerotherapy treatment vascular lesion injection agent cause thicken vessel wall , obstruction blood flow , clot formation collapse lesion . Sclerotherapy establish treatment modality vascular malformation skin , GI tract , genitourinary tract use lesion various site head neck . STS anion surfactant ( detergent ) commonly use sclerotherapy . There case report literature describe sclerotherapy treatment epistaxis relate HHT use agent , case report lead prospective study . We perform pilot study analyze tolerability effectiveness sclerotherapy STS series patient recurrent epistaxis related HHT . In series , treatment find well tolerated effective , base patient administer questionnaire review clinical data . No complication relate procedure note . Further prospective study would help elucidate role sclerotherapy STS treatment algorithm recurrent epistaxis relate HHT . Our goal conduct prospective , randomized-controlled trial test efficacy tolerability sclerotherapy use STS treatment recurrent epistaxis due HHT . A modify crossover design utilized intervention group receive sclerotherapy , plus additional , previously utilized standard treatment method need control epistaxis . The control group receive current standard treatment method , follow delay intervention sclerotherapy . The primary outcome frequency severity epistaxis . Secondary endpoint hemoglobin level , tolerability treatment , additional treatment requirement , quality life .</detailed_description>
