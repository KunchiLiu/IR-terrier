	<brief_summary>In study examine whether alternate treatment two class drug ( TKI 's m-TOR inhibitor ) postpones prevents drug resistance patient renal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotating Pazopanib Everolimus Avoid Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current practice treat VEGFR-TKI mTOR inhibitor progression continue next active agent . From biological perspective , TKI 's likely activate compensatory pathway , may ultimately lead development resistance . Recent study suggest resistance treatment TKI may reversible stop treatment . There therefore rationale alternate treatment prevent delay occurrence resistance . Our hypothesis alternate active agent clear cell renal carcinoma ( ccRCC ) may reduce side effect , improve tolerability compliance treatment prolong progression free survival overall survival compare standard care .</detailed_description>
