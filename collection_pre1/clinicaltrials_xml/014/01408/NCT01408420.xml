	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : Renal function cardiac surgery Impaired kidney function well know complication cardiac surgery observe 30 % patient , depend definition acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . The precise pathophysiological mechanism unknown , , however , quite obvious AKI initiate single harmful factor seem result different combine factor . Known risk factor development postoperative AKI cardiac incompensation , poor ejection fraction , gender , chronic obstructive lung disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) , previous heart surgery , acute surgery , complexity surgery , preoperative creatinine level prolong duration extracorporeal perfusion . These association necessarily causal . It surprising subacute operation severe aortic stenosis patient preoperatively poor circulation marginally increase S-creatinine , result impair renal function postoperatively . However , conclude cardiac surgery reason AKI justify . Several peroperative factor likely contribute development AKI . Renal perfusion oxygen delivery might reduce ( hypotension , lack pulsatile flow extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) , vasoactive pharmacological agent , anaesthesia ) , risk embolus , general inflammatory response , direct nephrotoxin ( free haemoglobin , free radical , gentamycin etc . ) haemodilution . Current knowledge limit general insight regional perfusion extracorporeal perfusion ( heart-lung-machine ) sparse . There , however , exist guideline regard flow blood pressure ECC , base upon empiric data , controversial vary centre centre . The primary focus regional cerebral perfusion possibility reduce frequency cerebral complication cardiac surgery . This interest easily explain obvious catastrophic consequence patient due coma , hemiparesis serious cognitive dysfunction . The consequence AKI less evident , however direct strong association moderately increase postoperative creatinine level , reduce glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 30 day mortality long term survival . A recent analysis kidney function lung transplant patient department use ECC show GFR dramatically reduce 40 % 14 day surgery . This impairment furthermore show irreversible . Cyclosporine A known nephrotoxic long term , hardly explain observed GFR reduction 14 day , must result combined influence surgical/anaesthesiological trauma , cyclosporine , side effect antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal immunosuppressive treatment . Data internal prospective registry show increase incidence patient renal complication . In 2008 temporary dialysis necessary 7 % patient ( 76/1130 ) 19 % patient postoperative increase S-creatinine &gt; 200 μmol/l observe , mirror reduction kidney function 60-70 % . We assume kidney function completely normalized time , actually know patient routinely control cardiac surgery outpatient basis . Currently , gather 1-year outcome data patient , undergone postoperative dialysis 2008 . One reason increase frequency AKI might increase patient age , thereby , increase comorbidity . At time administration ECC change . Ten year ago patient routinely cool ECC . This case anymore result reduce degree peripheral vessel constriction consequently reduce blood pressure . The question regard blood pressure blood flow optimal ECC remain controversial , generally much low blood pressure accept , long calculate blood flow maintain cerebral saturation value sufficient ( measure routinely ) . The literature subject sparse two randomized trial exists . One primary focus kidney autoregulation different perfusion pressure , recent trial could demonstrate significant difference kidney function measure s-creatinine 3 different perfusion pressure . However , S-creatinine crude method measure kidney function . In addition , trial include patient low risk postoperative AKI . Postoperative increase S-creatinine typically occur day 2 3 surgery , S-creatinine increase GFR reduce 50 % . This imply possible initial 50 % reduction kidney function detect routine biochemistry . It fair assume kidney injury occur surgery within first postoperative 24 hour . From biochemical point view apparent lack robust reliable early marker tubular kidney damage , would allow relevant early clinical intervention , possible prevention AKI aggravation . Creatinine kinases MB troponins reliable marker cardiac damage reveal acute myocardial infarction within hour occlusion coronary vessel . A corresponding early diagnosis AKI exist . At time seem likely specific enzymatic cell membrane component could detectable urine hour AKI . There focus possible candidate early detection AKI , none show sufficiently robust clinical use , yet . During last 20 year trial focus prevention prophylactic intervention avoid AKI anti-inflammatory drug , natriuresis induce agent ( ANP ) renal blood flow increase pharmacological intervention . However , none intervention sufficiently convince effect clinical testing . A recent Japanese study seem indicate prophylactic infusion ANP reduce postoperative kidney impairment , result need confirmation . Our department currently perform phase 2 trial cooperation Action Pharma ( Danish biotech company ) test AP214 , new small anti-inflammatory protein , potential kidney protective characteristic ( clinicaltrials.gov : 00903604 ) . At time investigate AP214 reduce nephrotoxic effect cyclosporine pig kidney transplant model . Summary / Conclusion : - An increase incidence renal complication see cardiac surgery . - The aetiology unknown . - It unclear reduction renal function reversible . - Renal complication associate increase short- long term mortality morbidity cardiac surgery . - Renal regional perfusion extracorporeal circulation poorly understood , impact blood pressure perfusion postoperative kidney function patient increase risk AKI cardiac surgery unknown . - There several potential biochemical marker early detection acute tubular kidney damage , however substantial lack clinical data . - Several intervention might kidney protective , however robust clinical data . 2 . Hypothesis PPC trial The glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) good preserve cardiac surgery ECC intend increase periprocedural arterial blood pressure compare current practice . 3 . Methods 1 . Design : Phase 1 : Randomized proof concept trial , n = 12 . Simple 1:1 randomisation . Phase 2 : If proof concept trial turn positive logistically feasible ( show , see later ) trial extend include 2 x 50 patient . There similar trial data literature base estimate necessary trial size . N = 100 qualified assumption base clinically possible include within 1-1½ year period . As early show lung transplant population GFR reduce 40 % . A clinically relevant improvement average reduction GFR would reduction 20 % . However , GFR data quite heterogeneous patient perfectly normal GFR 's throughout surgery postoperative course , others develop pronounced AKI . Phase 3 : Test different preventive prophylactic intervention ( AP214 , proANP , reduce haemodilution , pulsatile flow ECC ) . Trial size outcome measure dependent result phase 2 . There early data continuous saturation measurement renal venous blood sequential mass spectrometric analysis urine cardiac surgery population . Current result therefore decide future primary outcome measure . 2 . Inclusion- exclusion criterion : Patients increase risk postoperative AKI , give write consent appropriate information , include . Inclusion criterion : - Age &gt; 70 - Combined procedure ( heart valve- , bypass surgery aortic aneurysm ) Exclusion criterion : - Age &lt; 70 - S-creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/L - Acute operation - Endocarditis 3 . Intervention : Control group : Operation procedure ECC run perform accord current guideline Dept . Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery / Rigshospitalet . Intervention group : During ECC run MAP &gt; 60 mmHg maintain . In group GFR measurement perform use Cr-EDTA clearance method . GFR measure day surgery , day 4-6 surgery finally 4 month ( +/- 14 day ) . A catheter insert renal vein femoral vein . The position control fluoroscopy . Repeated saturation measurement , blood gas analysis , perform first 24 hour surgery . Blood sample take access . The catheter remove discharge intensive care unit . 4 . Outcome measure : Primary outcome measure : Cr-EDTA clearance , day surgery , day 4 - 6 4 month ( +/- 14 day ) surgery Secondary outcome measure : - Oxygen consumption on-line renal venous blood - Renal renin proANP excretion - U-NGAL , U-Apolipoprotein M , U-IL-18 , U-KIM-1 S-cystatin C - Urine proteomics ( mass spectrometry ) Tertiary outcome measure : Standard clinical data collection ( haemodynamics , diuresis , routine biochemistry ) clinical outcome term time intensive care , time discharge , incidence rate adverse- serious adverse event . 5 . Economy : This investigation non-profit trial . None project member economic interest trial . The involved clinical department cover direct indirect expense regard prolonged admission , GFR-measurements additional biochemical analysis estimate 15.800 DKK per patient . The Danish Heart Association cover salary Ph.D. student Kristian Kandler . 5 : Perspectives This project combine expert knowledge different medical field highly scientific clinical level ( advanced cardiac surgery high risk patient , advance postoperative intensive care , innovative monitoring ( invasive , biochemical , clinical physiology ) . We expect provide original , innovative scientifically relevant result contribute good understanding renal pathophysiology autoregulation cardiac surgery . As clinical randomise trial study may show new possibility reduce incidence postoperative renal complication group patient significant mortality morbidity .</detailed_description>
