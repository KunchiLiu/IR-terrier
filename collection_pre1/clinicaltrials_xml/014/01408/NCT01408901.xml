	<brief_title>Treadmill Exercise GM-CSF Study Improving Functioning Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eight million men woman United States low extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . PAD expect increasingly common population survive long chronic disease . Patients PAD great functional impairment faster functional decline compare without PAD . However , currently two FDA approve medication improve functional performance patient PAD . Furthermore , FDA approve medication modestly beneficial improve walk performance patient PAD . Preliminary evidence suggest increase circulate level CD34+ cell granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) therapy may improve walk performance patient PAD . However , result small clinical trial test ability GM-CSF improve walk performance patient PAD mixed . The association GM-CSF improve walking performance PAD definitively establish . Preliminary data also suggest low extremity ischemia , induce walk exercise , may increase circulate CD34+ cell level , enhance home CD34+ cell ischemic site , augment ability GMCSF improve walk performance PAD . However , currently unknown whether combination GM-CSF supervise treadmill exercise significantly improve functional performance either therapy alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants ankle brachial index ( ABI ) ≤ 0.90 eligible participation . 2 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 ≤ 1.00 experience 20 % drop ankle pressure heelrise exercise eligible . 3 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 medical record evidence prior low extremity revascularization experience 20 % drop ankle pressure heelrise exercise eligible inclusion . 4 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 medical record evidence noninvasive vascular laboratory test result consistent PAD . Note screenpositive test Lifeline Screening sufficient inclusion study . The following exclusion criterion initially assess telephone : 1 . Below aboveknee amputation . 2 . Wheelchair confinement . 3 . Use walk aid cane ( i.e . people use walker ) . 4 . NonEnglish speaking . 5 . Significant hearing impairment . 6 . Significant visual impairment . 7 . Diagnosis Parkinson 's disease . 8 . Inability return medical center require visit frequency ( three time per week ) . 9 . &gt; Class II New York Heart Association heart failure angina ( symptoms rest minimal exertion ) . 10 . Any increase angina pectoris symptom previous 6 month angina rest . 11 . Foot ulcer . ( Participants foot ulcer exclude telephone and/or baseline study visit ) . 12 . Lower extremity revascularization last three month major orthopedic surgery previous three month . 13 . Myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary artery bypass graft previous 3 month . 14 . Major medical illness include end stage renal disease require dialysis chronic lung disease require oxygen , since individual may able adhere study requirement . Participants use oxygen night may still qualify . 15 . Potential participant receive GCSF , GMCSF , erythropoietin within past year exclude intervention may influence study outcome independently intervention . 16 . Premenopausal woman exclude cyclic estrogen change influence progenitor cell level . 17 . Potential participant diabetes documented proliferative retinopathy exclude GMCSF may exacerbate condition . 18 . Potential participant history myeloid malignancy exclude GMCSF may exacerbate condition . 19 . Potential participant treat late stage cancer past three year , since GMCSF may theoretically activate quiescent cancer cell . 20 . Planned low extremity revascularization within next 6 month . 21 . Current participation another clinical trial . If participant recently complete clinical trial , least three month must pass consider PROPEL Trial . However , clinical trial stem cell gene therapy intervention , potential participant potentially eligible immediately final study visit stem cell gene therapy clinical trial , long least six month pass since participant receive final treatment stem cell gene therapy intervention . 22 . Walking exercise level comparable target intervention . 23 . Current participation completion cardiac rehabilitation program within last six month . The following exclusion criterion assess time study visit later : 24 . Severe aortic stenosis identify physical exam study visit . 25 . Critical limb ischemia identify physical exam study visit . 26 . Coronary ischemia exercise , define ST segment depression &gt; 1 mm baseline exercise treadmill test , without associate chest discomfort , without perfusion stress test demonstrate reversible ischemia within previous 3 month . 27 . Leftbundle branch block significant STT wave change baseline ECG without perfusion stress test demonstrate reversible ischemia within previous 3 month . 28 . Stopping treadmill stress test shortness breath , chest pain , hip pain , knee pain , another symptom may represent ischemic leg pain . 29 . Stopping sixminute walk test symptom ischemic leg symptom . 30 . Foot ulcer identify study visit . 31 . MiniMental Status Examination ( MMSE ) score &lt; 23 disable psychiatric disease . 32 . Failure complete study runin period . 33 . Walking impairment due cause PAD . In addition exclusion criterion list , individual think poorly suit intervention ( i.e . good fit ) exclude discretion principal investigator .</criteria>
