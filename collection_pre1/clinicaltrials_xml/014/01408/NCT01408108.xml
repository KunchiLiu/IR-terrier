	<brief_summary>This study prospective randomize trial enrol least 100 participant compare efficacy safety two alternative method laparoscopic hiatal repair large ( i.e . hiatal surface area ( HSA ) range 10 20 sq.cm , correspond diameter defect 5 8 cm ) type I , II , III hiatal hernia : primary crural repair repair partially absorbable lightweight mesh . According literature , rate anatomical failure recurrence GERD primary repair large hiatal hernia reach 42 % . Mesh repair decrease rate failure , however , polypropylene composite PTFE mesh use widely , result unacceptable rate long-term dysphagia oesophageal stricture . Our experience 400 repair use partially absorbable lightweight mesh Ultrapro ( Ethicon ) original sub-lay technique fixation preclude contact mesh oesophagus , show low recurrence rate case long-term dysphagia . Thus , final conclusion could establish prospective randomize study . Our hypothesis : original technique lightweight mesh repair highly effective prevention recurrence compare primary repair safe term mesh-related dysphagia oesophageal stricture . The long-term result ( 24 month post surgery every patient ) study use symptom questionnaire , quality life satisfaction questionnaire , barium study , endoscopic examination , 24-hour pH testing , analysis possible reoperations .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Lightweight Mesh Repair Large Hiatal Hernias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods laparoscopic repair large giant hiatal hernia challenge question gastrointestinal minimally invasive surgery . The literature demonstrate high rate anatomical functional recurrence laparoscopic repair large hiatal hernia , particularly follow primary crural repair . Different method mesh repair introduce several trial show benefit . However , necessity method prosthetic repair remain questionable mesh repair result high frequency long-term dysphagia oesophageal stricture . There insufficient grade 1 evidence choice optimal method repair large hiatal hernia . Only 3 prospective randomize trial compare prosthetic primary hiatal repair publish Frantzides et al ( 2002 ) , Granderath et al ( 2005 ) , Oelschlager et al ( 2006 ) . However , trial could recommend effective , safe , relatively inexpensive method repair . Although Frantzides et al ( 2002 ) show statistically significant decrease recurrence rate composite ( ePTFE ) mesh arm , study include patient diameter defect 8 cm great , thus still unknown whether mesh use hernias small diameter hernia defect , example , 5 8 cm . Most specialist use mesh diameter defect great 5 cm , base experience widespread literature data , include study Champion et al ( 1998 , 2003 ) . In addition , hiatal surface area ( HSA ) , first describe Granderath et al ( 2007 ) , sensitive measure diameter hiatal hernia defect , trial focus . Finally , ePTFE prosthesis rather expensive . The trial Granderath et al ( 2005 ) also primarily focus relation diameter hernia defect rate recurrence . In study , recurrence rate also small polypropylene arm , rate dysphagia lager arm . Although late author report difference arm rate dysphagia motility disorder vanish 1 year , author still consider polypropylene mesh potentially unsafe ( Frantzides et al , 2010 ) . To remove risk mesh-related oesophageal complication , biological prosthesis introduce hiatal repair , study Oelschlager et al ( 2006 ) demonstrate insignificant difference recurrence rate prosthesis arm compare primary repair arm , although case mesh-related complication observe prosthesis arm . Data literature international congress suggest biological device widely use set large hiatal hernia due high rate recurrence high price . Data another recent numerous publication include review make conclusion large giant hiatal hernia require mesh repair search optimal prosthesis fashion fixation ongoing . Hiatal repair partially absorbable lightweight mesh promise technique may become optimal minimize recurrence oesophageal complication . Hazebroek et al ( 2008 ) report good functional , endoscopic , radiological outcome term esophageal complication on-lay placement titanium-coated lightweight polypropylene mesh ( non-randomized prospective study ) . Our experience 400 repair use lightweight mesh ( Ultrapro , Ethicon ) original sub-lay technique fixation preclude contact mesh oesophagus , show low recurrence rate ( 4,9 % ) case long-term dysphagia ( 2,1 % ) . Therefore , hypothesis double-blind prospective randomize trial : original technique lightweight mesh ( Ultrapro , Ethicon ) repair highly effective prevention recurrence compare primary repair safe term mesh-related dysphagia oesophageal stricture . The study enroll least 100 patient large ( i.e . hiatal surface area ( HSA ) range 10 20 sq.cm , correspond diameter defect 5 8 cm ) type I , II , III hiatal hernia . The chosen size defect questionable term need apply mesh : HSA 20 sq.cm great necessity mesh repair obvious , less 10 sq.cm usage mesh unreasonable . The basic eligibility criterion : absence oesophageal motility disorder , absence oesophageal shorten require Collis procedure , absence peptic stricture factor may independently influence rate recurrence dysphagia/oesophageal stricture . Thus , difference arm method hiatal closure . To exclude fundoplication-related bias , standard floppy-Nissen procedure perform every patient . Every patient operate single surgical team experience 1500 laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure since 1998 . The necessary ethic regulation save include informed consent statement patient unaware method repair ( double-masked ) . Every patient go evaluate preoperatively , 6 month , 24 month postoperatively use symptom questionnaire , quality life satisfaction questionnaire , barium study , endoscopic examination , 24-hour pH testing . For issue efficacy prosthetic repair , recurrence rate hernia GERD , primary outcome measure , study . For issue safety prosthetic repair , rate short- long-term dysphagia/oesophageal strictures/mesh erosion , main secondary outcome measure , evaluate .</detailed_description>
