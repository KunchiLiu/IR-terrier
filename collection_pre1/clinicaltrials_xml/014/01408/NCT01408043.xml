	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study etoposide , filgrastim plerixafor improve stem cell mobilization patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Giving colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim , plerixafor etoposide together help stem cell move patient 's bone marrow blood collect store .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide , Filgrastim , Plerixafor Improving Stem Cell Mobilization Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition plerixafor improve proportion patient lymphoma collect &gt; = 8 x 10^6 cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ cells/kg within two day 25 % compare historical estimate 42 % etoposide G-CSF ( filgrastim ) . II . To determine whether patient achieve collection &gt; = 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 15 % one year survival advantage relative historical estimate 68 % among patient mobilize &gt; = 2 &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg etoposide G-CSF . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate patient receive &gt; = 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg rapid neutrophil platelet recovery earlier hospital discharge receive &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD 34+ cells/kg . II . To compare overall survival progression-free survival patient receive &gt; = 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg receive &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg . III . To compare number day apheresis required achieve goal , transfusion requirement , hospitalization cost , need remobilization group . IV . To evaluate whether peripheral CD34+ cell count correlate graft content CD34+ cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive etoposide intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 0 , filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) begin day 1 , plerixafor SC 15-18 hour prior apheresis . Patients unable achieve target collection &gt; = 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg receive another dose plerixafor follow apheresis . Following second apheresis , patient achieve = &lt; 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg may continue filgrastim plerixafor continue collection accord attend physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day least 1 year .</detailed_description>
