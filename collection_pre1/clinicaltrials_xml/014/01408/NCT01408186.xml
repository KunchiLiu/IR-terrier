	<brief_summary>Peptic ulcer bleed associate ASA NSAIDs major cause hospitalization Hong Kong . The investigator previously show ASA NSAIDs account half case hospitalization peptic ulcer bleeding . Currently , ASA use contribute one-third bleeding ulcer admit investigator hospital serf local population 1.5 million . In patient acute coronary syndrome acute ischemic stroke develop ASA-induced bleed peptic ulcer , whether ASA discontinue ulcer heal major dilemma . In another double-blind randomized trial , investigator show discontinuation ASA endoscopic treatment bleed ulcer associate significantly increase mortality within 8 week . In absence safer aspirin , co-therapy gastroprotective drug remain dominant preventive strategy . Given vast number people take ASA , however , cost-effective identify treat high risk ulcer bleed strong indication ASA use . Data observational study randomize trial consistently show PPIs effective reducing risk ulcer bleed associate ASA . Other potential preventive strategy include eradication H. pylorus infection , substitution ASA non-aspirin anti-platelet drug , co-therapy misoprostol H2RAs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ASP ( PPI_H2RA ) Study-H2RA Versus PPI Prevention Recurrent UGIB High-risk Users Low-dose ASA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No dose `` low-dose '' aspirin ( ASA ) safe term risk ulcer bleeding . Even dose low 75 mg daily , ASA double risk ulcer bleed compare risk non-users . This rise incidence associate 44 % increase usage ASA . In Hong Kong , ASA also major cause peptic ulcer complication . In absence safer aspirin , co-therapy gastroprotective drug remain dominant preventive strategy . Given vast number people take ASA , however , cost-effective identify treat high risk ulcer bleed strong indication ASA use . Data observational study randomize trial consistently show PPIs effective reducing risk ulcer bleed associate ASA . Other potential preventive strategy include eradication H. pylorus infection , substitution ASA non-aspirin anti-platelet drug , co-therapy misoprostol H2RAs . Among preventive strategy , co-therapy PPI prevention ulcer bleed high-risk ASA user remain studied best proven strategy . H2-receptor antagonist ( H2RAs ) relatively weak acid suppress drug compare PPIs . Very study evaluate efficacy H2RAs prevention peptic ulcer bleed ASA . Two case-control study yield conflict result regard efficacy H2RAs reduce risk hospitalization ulcer bleed ASA . There limited data efficacy H2RAs , however , local health authority endorse use H2RA co-therapy high-risk ASA user since 2001 . On hand , H2RAs two potential advantage PPIs . First , generic H2RAs much cheap generic PPIs Hong Kong . Second , unlike interaction PPIs clopidogrel , concomitant use H2RAs clopidogrel associate increase risk recurrent myocardial infarction . Thus , H2RA might cheap safe gastroprotective drug patient require dual anti-platelet therapy ( i.e. , ASA clopidogrel ) require coronary stent . In patient acute coronary syndrome acute ischemic stroke develop ASA-induced bleed peptic ulcer , whether ASA discontinue ulcer heal major dilemma . In another double-blind randomized trial , show discontinuation ASA endoscopic treatment bleed ulcer associate significantly increase mortality within 8 week . The investigator aim test hypothesis PPI superior H2RA prevention recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding ASA user history ulcer bleeding</detailed_description>
