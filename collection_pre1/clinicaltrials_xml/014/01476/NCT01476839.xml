	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy give together combination chemotherapy stem cell transplant see well work treat patient primary refractory ( respond treatment ) relapse ( return treatment ) Hodgkin lymphoma . Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody find cancer cell carry cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ( BEAM ) , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Combination Chemotherapy Before Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Primary Refractory Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) regimen yttrium Y-90 basiliximab/DOTA , give combination standard dose ( ) BEAM patient primary progressive relapse Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . II . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) characterize toxicity dose level - include time course . III . To evaluate hematological recovery term neutrophil platelet engraftment time . IV . To estimate overall response rate ( ORR : complete remission [ CR ] + partial remission [ PR ] ) , response duration , overall survival , progression-free survival , cumulative incidence non-relapse mortality relapse/progression . V. To estimate radiation dos whole body normal organ serial image study . VI . To define biodistribution/extended pharmacokinetics 111indium ( In ) -basiliximab/DOTA 90Y- basiliximab/DOTA include terminal elimination , serum half-life ( t1/2 ) , area curve ( AUC ) . OUTLINE : DOSIMETRY STUDY : Patients receive basiliximab intravenously ( IV ) indium In 111 basiliximab IV day -21 . Patients undergo indium In 111 imaging scan daily . Patients appropriate biodistribution continue treatment . TREATMENT : Patients receive basiliximab IV yttrium Y 90 basiliximab IV day -14 . Patients also receive BEAM chemotherapy comprise carmustine IV 2 hour day -7 -6 , etoposide IV 4 hour twice daily ( BID ) cytarabine IV 2 hour BID day -5 -2 , melphalan IV day -1 . Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell infusion day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 90-100 , 180 , 1 year , 1.5 year , 2-5 year .</detailed_description>
