	<brief_summary>A Japanese study show additional use `` Extensive Intraperitoneal Lavage '' ( EIPL ) , i.e . extensive wash abdominal cavity water , surgery gastric cancer lead significant increase survival . However , study confine patient upon commence surgery , free peritoneal tumor cell detect , small fraction patient . The primary objective study ass patient undergo removal stomach adjacent lymph node stomach cancer , EIPL eliminate free peritoneal tumor cell present begin surgery stomach lymph node removal . Secondary objective assess often free peritoneal tumor cell occur patient stomach cancer , often surgical resection lead release tumor cell , safety EIPL procedure , disease-free overall survival patient undergoing EIPL . Based outcome japanese study want test special laboratory method lavage lead good outcome . Specifically , trial test hypothesis ) lymph node dissection cause release tumor cell abdominal cavity , b ) EIPL eliminate free peritoneal tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elimination Peritoneal Tumor Cells With Extensive Peritoneal Lavage During Surgery Patients With Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite existence multimodal therapy , long-term survival patient gastric cancer remain poor . In advanced tumor stage , five-year survival rate rarely exceed 30 % . One factor limit overall survival peritoneal carcinomatosis , frequently occur surgical treatment curative intention . Peritoneal carcinomatosis suppose develop peritoneal implantation tumor cell already present abdominal cavity primary surgery . It assume serosal tumor infiltration intraoperative lymphadenectomy , per se lead survival improvement ( 1 ) therefore consider standard Europe Japan ( ( 2 ) , http : //www.jpca.jp/PDFfiles/ Guidelines2004_eng.pdf ) , release tumor cell peritoneal cavity . Of note , Japanese study find tumor cell release peritoneal cavity lymphadenectomy 14-46 % patient , depend preoperative tumor stage ( 3 ) . A randomized clinical trial Japan ( 4 ) demonstrate `` extensive intraperitoneal lavage '' ( EIPL ) , i.e . irrigation abdominal cavity ten time one liter physiological saline solution , combination intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( IPC ) carry gastrectomy lymphadenectomy , lead significant improvement overall survival compare patient receive surgery IPC without EIPL , receive surgery alone without EIPL IPC . These result suggest large survival benefit attributable addition EIPL IPC ( 5-year survival rate : 43.8 % vs. 4.6 % ) addition IPC surgery alone ( 5-year survival rate : 4.6 % vs. 0 % ) . However , important consider study include patient peritoneal tumor cell detect resection stomach lymph node . Thus , 90 1522 ( 5.9 % ) patient operate participate center throughout study period fulfil inclusion criterion . Furthermore , study design appropriate ass EIPL really lead reduction free tumor cell assume . Regarding hypothesis , available result stem single patient small study ( 4 ; 5 ) . To date , high level evidence large population . The present trial , first time , use EIPL additional treatment patient tumor stage regardless detection intraperitoneal tumor cell begin operation . Intraperitoneal lavage fluid harvest assessed tumor cell three different point time : ( ) gastrectomy lymphadenectomy ( ii ) gastrectomy lymphadenectomy , directly EIPL ( iii ) EIPL The trial test hypothesis ) lymph node dissection cause release tumor cell abdominal cavity , b ) EIPL eliminate free peritoneal tumor cell .</detailed_description>
