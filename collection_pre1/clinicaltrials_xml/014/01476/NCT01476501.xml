	<brief_summary>Diabetes life-long disease get common Canada . One common problem people kidney disease diabetes low bone mineral density ( BMD ) . This lead high chance break bone , infection life-long health problem . The common reason low BMD get enough vitamin D ( Vit D ) diet enough sunlight . This common Canada ( especially northern Alberta ) winter long . Most people also n't eat drink enough food high Vit D ( like milk ) n't enough Vit D body make healthy bone . This mean way get enough Vit D body bone kidney disease take extra vitamin D pill . Most people aware poor bone health break bone . Broken bone really hurt prevent person able walk take care . Right , sure exactly much Vit D people diabetes kidney disease need take prevent low BMD often need take . Our plan study effect two way take Vit D pill ( every day month ) overall Vit D status bone health adult patient diabetes chronic kidney disease see influence quality life . Hypotheses : 1 . Vitamin D supplementation ( 2,000 IU/day 40,000 IU/month ) six month result significantly improve overall vitamin D status improve marker bone health adult patient diabetic nephropathy . 2 . Monthly dose vitamin D ( 40,000 IU/month ) six month result improve patient adherence satisfaction vitamin D supplementation compare daily dose vitamin D ( 2000 IU/D ) . This improve vitamin D status bone health parameter , result increase quality life sense well-being .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abstract : Vitamin D well-established role bone health prevention fracture associate increased morbidity mortality , reduce quality life . However , many individual sub-optimal vitamin D status ( &lt; 75nmol/l ) , risk increase geographical location , age , ethnicity , inadequate dietary intake disease . Diabetes kidney disease two chronic disease associate poor bone health suboptimal vitamin D status . Individuals diabetes chronic kidney disease live northern Alberta particular risk suboptimal vitamin D status poor bone health due dietary restriction vitamin D rich food ( e.g . milk product also high phosphorus carbohydrate ) , negligible cutaneous synthesis long winter month , reduce renal capacity synthesize active vitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) . In general Canadian population , able meet dietary recommendation vitamin D intake diet alone often rely vitamin D supplement . The need vitamin D supplementation increase diabetic nephropathy , however optimal dose strategy vitamin D supplementation unknown . Like chronic disease , adherence therapy major issue population . With additional chronic disease individual , adherence therapy quality life decrease . Adherence vitamin D therapy know particularly poor . This may relate silent nature bone disease , poor bone health often identify fracture occur . Novel strategy vitamin D supplementation need prevent poor bone health fracture , result decline quality life ensues . Therefore important identify vitamin D supplementation strategy increase adherence vitamin D supplementation improve vitamin D status bone health adult diabetes nephropathy . Objectives : - Examine impact two approach oral high dose vitamin D supplementation ( 2,000 IU/day versus 40,000 IU/month six month ) overall vitamin D status marker bone turnover adult patient diabetic nephropathy . - Examine daily versus monthly vitamin D supplementation strategy regard adherence , satisfaction quality life adult patient diabetic nephropathy . Hypotheses : 1 . Vitamin D supplementation ( 2,000 IU/day 40,000 IU/month ) six month result significantly improve overall vitamin D status improve marker bone health adult patient diabetic nephropathy . 2 . Monthly dose vitamin D ( 40,000 IU/month ) six month result improve patient adherence satisfaction vitamin D supplementation compare daily dose vitamin D ( 2000 IU/D ) . This improve vitamin D status bone health parameter , result increase quality life sense well-being .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis diabetes ( type 1 2 ) stage 24 chronic kidney disease ( glomerular filtration rate : 1589 ml/min/1.73m2 ) Patients comorbid condition know affect vitamin D metabolism include gastrointestinal , liver , rheumatoid bone disorder ( e.g . hyperthyroidism , untreated celiac disease , cancer , Paget 's disease , sarcoidosis , malabsorption , etc ) . Individuals severe , permanent vision impairment exclude preclude read supplement label accurately safely . Pregnant woman exclude DXA scan recommend pregnancy . Patients weigh &gt; 136kg exclude DXA table accommodate weight . Patients drug therapy know interfere vitamin D ( e.g . oral glucocorticoid , cholestyramine , colestipol , mineral oil , Orlistat , digoxin , antacid ) . Patients stage 5 CKD ( GFR &lt; 15ml/min/1.73m2 ) , receive dialysis kidney transplant list . Patients preexist hypercalcemia ( &gt; 2.75mmol/l ) , hyperphosphatemia ( &gt; 2.0mmol/l ) , severe hyperparathyroidism ( PTH &gt; 600pg/ml ) , serum 25 ( OH ) D &gt; 200nmol/l . Patients serum 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 37.5nmol/l time study entry/screening control correction vitamin D deficiency .</criteria>
