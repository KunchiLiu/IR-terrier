	<brief_title>A Study Safety Activity MEK Inhibitor Given Together With AKT Inhibitor Patients With Multiple Myeloma Solid Tumor Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , two part , Phase I/II study investigate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , clinical activity MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 administer combination AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 subject solid tumor multiple myeloma . In Part 1 , safety tolerability range dose GSK1120212 GSK2110183 dose combination investigate ; pharmacokinetics also analyze determine whether drug-drug interaction GSK1120212 GSK2110183 dose combination . The second part study focus evaluation clinical efficacy combination well pharmacodynamic response subject proteasome-refractory multiple myeloma ( Part 2A ) solid tumor , putatively endometrial triple negative breast cancer ( Part 2B ) .</detailed_description>
