	<detailed_description>31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31P MRS ) non-invasive method measure muscle metabolism exercise . This protocol intend provide information planning future clinical trial apply 31P MRS endpoint measure proof pharmacology study novel therapeutic molecule . Parts A &amp; B study refine image exercise protocols 31P MRS brief period muscle ischaemia ass test-retest variance . In Part C apply 31P MRS aerobic exercise pilot study estimate difference skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism age- sex-matched control subject patient myopathy associate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease .</detailed_description>
