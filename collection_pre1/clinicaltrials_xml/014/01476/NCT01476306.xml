	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct two-arm , parallel group , randomize comparative effectiveness study across two site increase specialty access improve care individual Parkinsonism caregiver . Twenty individual Parkinsonism recruit Johns Hopkins University University Rochester ( approximately ten site ) . They randomize either continue usual in-person care specialist receive care specialist via telemedicine home . Following in-person baseline/screening visit , approximately ten individual first arm ( virtual house call ) receive three visit movement disorder specialist via telemedicine ( use web-based video conferencing ) home . Approximately ten individual second ( control ) arm receive three in-person visit academic medical center specialist . Approximately two week completion clinical visit , nurse coordinator call patient call address question ensure appropriate understanding recommendation ( telemedicine control arm ) . Overall , study - consistent national priority comparative effectiveness research - compare use telemedicine manage Parkinsonism usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Providing Specialty Care Individuals With Parkinsonism Directly Their Homes Via Web-based Video Conferencingâ€” A Comparative Effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Abstract The research 's overall objective improve care individual Parkinsonism . Parkinsonism clinically determine presence least 2 follow : 1 ) rest tremor , 2 ) bradykinesia , 3 ) cogwheel rigidity , 4 ) difficulty gait balance . The common cause Parkinsonism Parkinson disease . Parkinson disease chronic condition whose burden grow United States globally . However , access specialty care limit chiefly urban area frequently inefficient . One way remove geographic barrier care use web-based video conferencing ( telemedicine ) . To evaluate study 's aim , investigator conduct seven-month randomize control study twenty patient Parkinsonism across two site contrast comparative effectiveness standard in-person specialty visit versus conduct via web-based video conferencing ( telemedicine ) . It hypothesize `` virtual house call '' feasible , clinically non-inferior usual care , economically valuable . This research expand geographic scope specialty care provide national model provide home-based , patient-centered , cost-effective care Parkinsonism anywhere live . 2 . Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) The specific objective study follow : Aim 1 : To evaluate feasibility provide specialty care individual Parkinsonism via web-based video conferencing ( telemedicine ) home calculate proportion specialty visit complete schedule . Hypothesis 1 : Individuals receive care via telemedicine home complete least 80 % visit schedule . Aim 2 : To explore clinical benefit , measure change baseline quality life measure Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 ( PDQ-39 ) . Hypothesis 2 : In pilot study , change quality life comparable two group . Aim 3 : To explore economic benefit provide specialty care via telemedicine home . Hypothesis 3 : For patient caregiver , travel labor saving receive care home outweigh technology cost telemedicine visit .</detailed_description>
