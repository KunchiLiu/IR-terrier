	<brief_summary>Mutations gene affect pain transmission start know , investigator investigate mutation glycine channel , influence pain modulation . Pain modulation ability central nervous system enhance diminish sensation pain . The investigator therefore test patient healthy volunteer quantitative sensory test , basically determine point stimulation start induce pain . These test reliable permit direct comparison healthy volunteer patient affect glycine gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Mutations Glycine Gene Associated With Hyperekplexia Central Pain Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Hyperekplexia , also know hereditary startle disease stiff baby syndrome , rare neurogenetic non-epileptic disorder characterize exaggerated persistent startle response neonatal hypertonia unexpected auditory , somatosensory visual stimulus . Startle responses generalized muscle stiffness gradually subside first month life . Pathological startle response remain throughout adulthood result unprotected fall injury . Hereditary hyperekplexia identify 70 pedigree , characterize major form . Some occasional occurrence minor form describe rare family , presence may remain clinically undetected . The clinical diagnosis major form hyperekplexia need three mandatory feature : 1 . Generalized stiffness birth normalize first year life 2 . Excessive startling unexpected stimulus , particularly auditory , present birth remain throughout life 3 . Generalized stiffness startle reflex last second Five gene associate hyperekplexia , disease cause mutation gene encode different subunit inhibitory postsynaptic glycine receptor GLRA1 GLRB . Additionally defect presynaptic glycine transporter gene ( SLC6A5 ) recently identify human hyperekplexia . GPHN , encode glycinergic cluster molecule gephyrin , ARHGEF9 , X-linked gene encode collybistin , associate one know case hyperekplexia . The glycine receptor member pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family . The receptor membrane-embedded protein contain integral Cl- -selective pore . The glycine receptor major determinant inhibitory neurotransmission retina , spinal cord brainstem . Inhibitory synaptic transmission spinal cord dorsal horn use GABA glycine principle fast neurotransmitter . Both open Cl- -channels , induce postsynaptic hyperpolarisation impairs propagation excitatory potential dendrites neuron . Immunofluorescence study reveal abundant glycinergic innervation dorsal horn , site attribute long stand gate control theory pain . According model , inhibitory GABAergic glycinergic interneurons superficial spinal dorsal horn key component control pain transmission periphery brain . The model state non-painful stimulation felt non painful long synaptic GABAergic glycinergic inhibition remain intact . Pharmacological blockade GABAergic and/or glycinergic neurotransmission dorsal horn mimic many symptom inflammatory neuropathic pain . Additionally , loss synaptic inhibition dorsal horn occur animal model experimental pain . This difficult prove experimentally human , although study nociceptive long term potentiation suggest loss inhibitory interneurons dorsal horn may role development chronic pain patient . Objective The aim study evaluate first time human whether symptomatic mutation glycinergic system affect central pain processing . Positive result would suggestive important role glycinergic system pain modulation would therefore stimulate development pharmacological modulation human pain syndrome . Methods Design Assessment pain threshold consecutive hyperekplexia patient group sex age-matched healthy volunteer . Subjects We test consecutive patient one five mutation cite introduction . Patients receive compensation 150 Swiss Francs participation , plus reimbursement travel cost . 23 hyperekplexia patient recruit . Once test patient complete , 45 healthy age sex-matched control enrol . Treatment GABA-agonist ( mainly clonazepam ) discontinue safety reason . Pain test : Pressure pain detection threshold ( primary outcome ) Electric pain detection threshold single cutaneous temporal summation repeat electrical stimulation Heat cold pain detection , condition pain modulation</detailed_description>
