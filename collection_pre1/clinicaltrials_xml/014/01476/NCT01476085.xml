	<detailed_description>Apoptosis program cell death mechanism disrupt cancer cell allow live long grow faster normal cell . Apoptosis key target several novel anti-cancer agent . A biomarker could permit image level ongoing apoptosis could powerful tool associate drug development program provide relevant data support proof concept . In addition , use clinical setting may permit tailor treatment individual patient balance efficacy treatment know toxicity level . This study aim evaluate potential 2- ( 5- Fluoro pentyl ) -2-methyl malonic acid ( [ 18F ] ML10 ) , apoptosis image biomarker potential predict response patient Non Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . All patient baseline [ 18F ] ML10 PET-CT scan post-treatment scan initiation first course intravenous chemotherapy . The study aim enrol unto 16 subject Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma .</detailed_description>
