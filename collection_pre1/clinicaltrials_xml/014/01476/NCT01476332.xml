	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics 0.5 % 2.5 % Cis-UCA Eye Drops Adult Healthy Volunteers ( Phase I )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I single-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single multiple dose study evaluate safety , ocular tolerability pharmacokinetics 0.5 % 2.5 % cis-UCA eye drop healthy volunteer 15 day . After single day dose ( three time ) day 1 subsequent 7 ( ± 1 ) day wash-out period , multidose phase three time day administration 14 day start Primary objective : - Part 1 : To evaluate safety ocular tolerability 0.5 % 2.5 % cis-UCA eye drop placebo cis-UCA eye drop administer randomize eye three time single day , assess 7 ( ± 1 ) day follow dose healthy volunteer - Part 2 : To evaluate safety ocular tolerability 0.5 % 2.5 % cis-UCA eye drop placebo cis-UCA eye drop administer eye three time day 14 day , assess 7 day follow last dose healthy volunteer Secondary objective : - To evaluate single dose pharmacokinetics 0.5 % 2.5 % cis-UCA eye drop administer randomized eye adult healthy volunteer - To evaluate pharmacokinetics 0.5 % 2.5 % cis-UCA eye drop administer eye three time day 14 day adult healthy volunteer Healthy male female volunteer , 18-65 year age , history significant eye disease current eye disease would affect pharmacokinetics cis-UCA . Subjects without treatment-emergent adverse event Part 1 may continue Part 2 study .</detailed_description>
