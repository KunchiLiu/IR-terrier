	<brief_summary>While evidence identify conventional therapy definitive chronic lateral epicondylosis ( CLE , tennis elbow ) , basic science limit pilot level trial support rigorous assessment prolotherapy ( PrT ) platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) therapy CLE . The propose study conduct pilot RCT assess 2 PrT solution PRP injection commonly use treatment moderate-to-severe tennis elbow use clinical , biomechanical radiological outcome . Data study support future confirmatory study find effective treatment moderate-to-severe tennis elbow . In support goal , investigator propose follow research question . Does PrT PRP , compare waitlist control : 1. improve pain- function-dependent , CLE-specific quality life among adult CLE , assess validated questionnaire , elbow-specific Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation ? 2. improve upper extremity performance among adult CLE assess blind assessor use elbow-specific , effort-dependent biomechanical measure grip strength ( pain-free maximal ) , stiffness , effective mass damp 3. improve radiologic appearance several pathologic feature CLE evaluate use image study lateral elbow structure : ultrasound ass ) neovascularity ( color Doppler ) , b ) hypoechogenicity ( grayscale US ) , c ) tendon stiffness ( `` acousto-elastic strain gauge '' technique ) use standardize , 0-3 severity scale , ) MRI ass overall common extensor tensor tendon disease severity use standardized 0-3 scale ? 4. provide satisfy treatment subject assess treatment satisfaction survey qualitative exit interview ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CLE prevalent , disable condition significant individual societal cost . The incidence CLE increase . CLE often refractory care . There limited scientific evidence support specific therapy . PrT PRP show promise effective therapy CLE perform primary care set . Pilot-level RCTs PrT PRP CLE report large absolute effect size . Findings invitro animal study consistent result clinical trial suggest therapy improve clinical outcome modify disease CLE . However , prior research limit lack methodological rigor , non-validated outcome measure lack integrated multidisciplinary outcome measure . Positive trend propose study would suggest effect size PrT PRP CLE , allow calculation robust sample size power R01 study , pilot test use integrate set outcome measure . Statistically significant positive result clinical , biomechanical radiological outcome would demonstrate PrT PRP treat , modify disease may cure CLE . Such finding would provide enormous benefit patient improve quality life , reduce pain disability , industry society large reduce worker ' injury claim absenteeism .</detailed_description>
