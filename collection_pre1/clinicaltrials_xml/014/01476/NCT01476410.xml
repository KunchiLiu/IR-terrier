	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give brentuximab vedotin together combination chemotherapy work treat old patient previously untreated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate , brentuximab vedotin , block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine , dacarbazine ( AVD ) , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving brentuximab vedotin , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine , dacarbazine together may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
