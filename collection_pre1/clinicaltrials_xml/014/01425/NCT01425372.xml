	<brief_summary>Streptococcus pneumoniae major cause serious bacterial infection , particularly among young child . Over 30 different type pneumococcus germ cause invasive disease , 7 type ( namely serotypes 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F 23F ) responsible around 75 % case young child . A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 serotypes ( PCV7; Prevenar ® , Wyeth Vaccines ) introduce UK national immunisation programme September 2006 result rapid reduction pneumococcal disease cause 7 serotypes among vaccinated child older unvaccinated child adult herd immunity . By 2009 , half invasive pneumococcal case young child cause six pneumococcal serotypes ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 6A , 7F 19A ) include newly license 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV13; Prevenar 13® , Wyeth Vaccines ) . In April 2010 , PCV13 replace PCV7 UK immunisation programme aim reduce case invasive pneumococcal disease . The antibody responses induced 7 serotypes PCV13 PCV7 show comparable , protection offer additional 6 serotypes PCV13 merit study . Also , possible use PCV13 instead PCV7 may interfere immune response vaccine , Haemophilus influenzae serotype b ( Hib ) , give infant time PCV13 . The propose study aim collect one blood sample infant receive routine vaccination 2 , 3 4 month order measure immune response routine vaccine . The investigator hope result help u good understand add protection offer 13valent pneumococcal vaccine ensure child adequately protect vaccine receive .</brief_summary>
