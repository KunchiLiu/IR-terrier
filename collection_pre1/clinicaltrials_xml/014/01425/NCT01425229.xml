	<brief_summary>The aim present study assess impact OATP1B1 genotype ( SLCO1B1*15 vs. wild type ; ~2 % SLCO1B1*15 haplotypes Caucasian population ) CYP2C9 genotype ( *2 *3 allele vs. wild type ; ~5 % poor metabolisers Caucasian population ) pharmacokinetics bosentan impact CYP3A4-inhibition clarithromycin steady state bosentan CYP3A4 inducer . This study focus differential effect genotypes co-medication pharmacokinetics bosentan metabolic transport level . Participants genotyped CYP2C9 ( inclusion criterion ) , OATP1B1 ( inclusion criterion ) , CYP3A5 ( inclusion criterion ) .</brief_summary>
