	<brief_summary>Background : -Sjogren syndrome disease affect 1-4 million Americans . It common woman . It mainly affect gland produce saliva tear , lead dry eye dry mouth . The cause Sjogren syndrome unknown , inflammation play important role . The purpose study learn Sjogren syndrome . Objectives : -To good understand Sjogren syndrome begin affect patient develop good way treat . Eligibility : - Participants must 16 year age old . - They must diagnosis Sjogren syndrome least two symptom Sjogren syndrome . Design : - People take part study come NIH Clinical Center least three visit . - During visit , participant medical history physical exam . They oral dental assessment , saliva collection . Lab test ( blood urine ) dry eye exams do . Participants answer questionnaire salivary scintigraphy ( adults unless required diagnosis ) . - Other optional test may also do . Participants may come additional visit optional test disease change . - The treatment provide part study medical emergency complication occur NIH evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome ( SS ) autoimmune disease characterize chronic inflammation involve exocrine gland . Salivary lacrimal gland predominantly affect lead dry mouth dry eye exocrine organ also frequently involve . It one common rheumatic autoimmune disease , effect 1-4 million Americans , predominantly woman female male ratio 9:1 . Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome may occur alone ( primary SS ) , may coexist systemic connective tissue disorder ( secondary SS ) . In many case systemic manifestation , fatigue , arthritis , vasculitis , lung disease , peripheral central neuropathy autonomic nervous system dysfunction accompany glandular involvement . Patients systemic manifestation high risk lymphoma , incidence increase SS . The treatment sicca symptom mainly symptomatic , whereas management extraglandular manifestation similar autoimmune disease . The cause pathogenesis Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome still largely unknown . In genetically predispose individual various environmental factor , viral infection , may lead epithelial cell activation protract inflammatory response feature autoimmunity . Autoreactive lymphocyte autoantibody consider important process although pathogenic role particular autoantibody still undefined . Although inflammation may contribute exocrinopathy SS , relationship inflammation exocrine dysfunction poorly understood . Moreover , model explain many extraglandular manifestation SS patient , fatigue . Further study need well understand pathogenesis SS . OBJECTIVES The primary objective study enable collection longitudinal clinical laboratory data biologic specimens identify pathogenetic mechanism SS careful clinical phenotyping SS patient Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren s-like condition time collection biologic sample concurrent future laboratory study relate pathogenesis Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome . Another objective study identify biomarker candidate associate diagnosis , severity , prognosis , organ involvement SS . The protocol enable study genetic basis mechanistic aspect immunologic non-immunologic abnormality SS association various clinical phenotype . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA The study enroll 300 subject Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren s-like condition . Subjects age 16- year old fulfil European American Consensus Criteria Primary Secondary Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome eligible study . Selected subject incomplete Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome exclude European American criterion may also eligible . Screening do Characterization Diseases Salivary Gland Involvement protocol ( 15-D-0051 ) prospectively previous screen protocol ( 84-D-0056 ) . DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This longitudinal observational study . All subject least three core evaluation ( approximately biannually ) 4-5 year period . Additional evaluation may require significant change clinical condition subject likely related SS sicca syndrome provide additional research sample clinical data pathogenesis study . Clinical data collect questionnaire , personal interview , physical examination , laboratory test image study . The core evaluation include complete medical history physical examination complete oral dry eye evaluation . Research study include salivary scintigraphy functional assessment salivary gland function , test autonomous nervous system may include ultrasound guide parotid core needle biopsy . Blood , saliva biopsy sample store used laboratory research study aim pathogenesis Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome . Samples label code without personal identifier may share researcher outside NIH . DNA collect genetic study relate Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome related condition .</detailed_description>
