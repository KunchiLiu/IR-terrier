	<brief_summary>Inflammation blood vessel play important role development growth dilate abdominal aorta . An elevated blood pressure lead increase inflammation , therefore blood pressure lower important part treatment patient dilate abdominal aorta also elevate blood pressure . In investigator study investigator compare anti-inflammatory effect 2 different blood pressure lower strategy . The investigator hypothesize strategy decrease inflammation , however investigator believe total decrease inflammation depend type blood pressure lower medication use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Anti-inflammatory Effect Anti-hypertensive Treatment Patients With Small AAA 's Mild Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard therapy small AAAs currently consist `` watchful waiting '' strategy aggressive blood pressure control `` Watchful waiting '' include Ultrasound ( recently CT MRI scan ) every 12 month ( AAAs 3.5 - 4.4 cm ) every 6 month ( AAAs 4.5 5.5 cm ) observe . A growth rate &gt; 7 mm/ 6 month suggest threshold proceeding aneurysm repair irrespective aneurysm size . Clearly , need sensitive method evaluate progress AAA growth . Recent publication show evaluation AAAs use FDG-uptake PET-scan may identify small AAAs prone grow and/or rupture , AAAs compare normal aorta 's show increase inflammatory activity , consider major pathophysiological pathway . Evaluation FDG-uptake also sensitive enough observe short-term effect endovascular intervention large AAAs , unpublished data show statistically significant reduction aneurismal FDG-uptake 6 week endovascular repair large AAAs . Therefore , change aneurismal FDG-uptake may also promise sensitive method evaluate treatment effect medical intervention within relatively short period time ( 3 month ) . Just pressure unload may represent anti-inflammatory mechanism endovascular repair advance aneurysm , may milder pressure unload moderately hypertensive individual small aneurysm display similar anti-inflammatory effect . Such mild form pressure unload may attainable adequate anti-hypertensive drug therapy . In context , however , possible additional benefit may anti-hypertensive drug class propose exert specific anti-inflammatory effect relevant aneurysm inflammation . Local activation multiple component renin angiotensin system implicate development aneurysm , well inflammatory component . In accordance , preliminary evidence murine study suggest ACE inhibitor , example , may reduce inflammatory activity aneurysmatic vessel wall . However , since ACE inhibitor block renin angiotensin system halfway 's path , non-ACE conversion angiotensin I occur , rationale exists block renin angiotensin system upstream ACE . Upstream blockade renin-angiotensin system may additional advantage antagonise direct pro-inflammatory effect renin , identify , example , kidney tissue retinal microvessels . A case thus make renin inhibition potential optimal strategy reduce aneurysm inflammation hypertensive patient aortic aneurysm . In proposed pilot trial , direct renin inhibitor Aliskiren evaluate . As control condition , antihypertensive agent without postulate specific anti-inflammatory effect appropriate . Calcium channel blocker represent class . The current study explore size variability effect aliskiren monotherapy , combination aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide , amlodipine monotherapy , combination amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide FDG-uptake ( measurable top effect antihypertensive statin therapy ) . This allow accurate power calculation large future study aim prevention AAA-progression ( diameter rupture ) .</detailed_description>
