	<detailed_description>The trial describe part programme aim design complex , primary care prescribe safety improvement intervention test effectiveness randomise control trial . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) antiplatelet drug low dose aspirin clopidogrel responsible significant proportion hospital admission due preventable adverse drug event ( ADE ) , drug commonly associate fatal ADEs . Previous research identify group patient pattern co-prescription use drug particularly high-risk , national prescribing safety guidance embed research clear recommendation either avoid prescribing alternative , caution . In previous epidemiological work , show high-risk use NSAIDs , aspirin clopidogrel common , pilot work four practice show focused review prescribe practice reduce target high-risk NSAID prescribing approximately 40 % one round feedback . This effect size consistent PINCER trial intervention pharmacist facilitate review process . We hypothesise multi-faceted intervention comprising ( 1 ) educational outreach , ( 2 ) use informatics tool monitor prescribing pattern practice level prompt facilitate review individual patient risk ADEs ( 3 ) small financial incentive review patient reduce rate high-risk prescribing . The specific research question address trial : 1 . Does intervention reduce specify primary outcome composite measure high risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , aspirin clopidogrel prescribe ? 2 . Does intervention reduce specify secondary outcome : nine individual measure constitute composite ; relate admission hospital ; repeat v new prescribe ? 3 . If find effective , intervention cost-effective ? The trial use stepped-wedge design , particularly suit sequential roll-out intensive informatics base intervention focus patient safety . In design , participate practice receive intervention , randomise starting time . At point enter intervention phase trial , practice receive educational outreach visit include training use informatics tool . The informatics tool provide regular feedback change rate high-risk prescribe individual measure composite measure , ability drill-down individual patient level review summary patient 's relevant condition prescribe .</detailed_description>
