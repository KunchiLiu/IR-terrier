	<brief_summary>Patients liver failure undergo liver transplantation often clinical sub-clinical encephalopathy may lead increase intracranial pressure . The latter may lead abnormal regulation blood flow brain ( cerebral autoregulation ) complicate patient management general anesthesia . The current method monitoring elevate intracranial pressure invasive , thus , limit severe encephalopathy . In study investigator evaluate potential utility monitor cerebral blood flow autoregulation non-invasively use near infra-red spectroscopy patient undergo liver transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy complicate chronic liver failure patient undergo liver transplantation increase risk adverse outcome include mortality . Even mild hepatic encephalopathy may recognize clinically without specific test associate impaired functional status reduce quality life liver transplantation . The change see chronic liver failure , ( cerebral edema increase intracranial pressure ) adversely affect cerebral blood flow autoregulation may predispose brain injury multiple hemodynamic perturbation occur liver transplantation . Currently , invasive monitoring intracranial `` bolt '' method aggressively manage patient elevate intracranial pressure acute liver failure hepatic encephalopathy . The placement intracranial pressure catheter patient liver failure associate risk brain hemorrhage due presence coagulopathy . Further , risk type monitor outweighs benefit patient milder subclinical form hepatic encephalopathy . In pilot study 20 patient undergoing liver transplantation evaluate feasibility non-invasive monitoring CBF autoregulation ass whether autoregulation impair group patient . We hypothesize cerebral blood flow autoregulation impair patient undergo liver transplantation base severity liver disease . In situation , improve patient monitoring would allow clinician maintain arterial blood pressure individual 's low limit cerebral blood flow autoregulation might prevent devastate brain injury surgery . Cerebral blood flow autoregulation continuously monitor evaluate correlation coefficient cerebral blood flow velocity measure transcranial Doppler arterial blood pressure . Our group develop novel method autoregulation monitor use near infrared spectroscopy allow continuous monitor autoregulation cerebral oximetry index hemoglobin volume index ( , move linear correlation coefficient cortical tissue oxygen saturation hemoglobin level arterial blood pressure , respectively . The latter approach practical would allow widespread autoregulation monitoring diverse clinical setting . A secondary hypothesis study near infrared spectroscopy-based monitoring CBF autoregulation provide accurate assessment limit autoregulation compare clinically challenge transcranial Doppler method . Specific Aims : 1 . To assess whether patient undergo liver transplantation impair cerebral blood flow autoregulation . 2 . To evaluate whether non-invasive monitoring cerebral blood flow autoregulation cerebral oximetry index hemoglobin volume index identify low limit autoregulation within 10 mmHg compare measure transcranial Doppler .</detailed_description>
