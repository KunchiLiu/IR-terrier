	<brief_summary>Much progress treatment various tumor make laboratory result bring back patient , i.e . bench bedside . This trial intend collect sample keloid tissue patient study laboratory . Such research may help u find well treatment keloid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Keloid Tissue Bank</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To aim trial : 1 . To prospectively collect keloid normal skin tissue sample patient keloid perform keloid tissue biopsy biopsy uninvolved skin . 2 . To collect blood and/or saliva genomics , proteomics , tissue culture , flow cytometery keloid investigational study . 3 . To collect keloid tissue previously remove patient ( unrelated enrollment study ) . 4 . To prospectively collect keloid tissue patient undergo planned surgical removal keloid . 5 . To evaluate keloid histology , genomics , proteomics , molecular marker , cytokine , growth factor receptor , ligands signal transduction pathway within keloid tissue order find druggable target . 6 . To prospectively follow patient correlate patient demographic natural history disease , response past future treatment genomic molecular maker profile . 7 . To culture nucleate blood cell keloid patient order determine genomics disease well learn potential presence keloid stem cell peripheral blood . To use flow cytometry well technology search circulate keloid stem cell peripheral blood . 8 . To test vitro : A- The effect small molecule kinase inhibitor activation wild-type mutant kinase . B- The effect various drug inhibit ligand , receptor pathway .</detailed_description>
