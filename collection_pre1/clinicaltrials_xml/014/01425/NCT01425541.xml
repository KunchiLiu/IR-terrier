	<detailed_description>Adolescent hyperandrogenemia ( excess androgen production ) occur early puberty appear precursor adult polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . PCOS affect 6 % woman childbearing age United States . Those suffer disorder often experience irregular menstrual period , excess facial body hair , weight gain . PCOS also lead cause infertility . Women PCOS often report irregular menstrual cycle adolescent . A study adolescents menstrual irregularity show subject normalize endocrine function mature , majority maintain hyperandrogenism conjunction high level luteinizing hormone ( LH ) polycystic ovary . In addition , girl high level serum androgen often low fertility rate adulthood . We propose adult PCOS , perhaps adolescent hyperandrogenemia , due part dysregulation pituitary ovarian hormone . Synthesis secretion LH follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) primarily regulate gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) . Both LH FSH secrete gonadotrope cell , frequency stimulation cell GnRH part determine hormone release . In primate , rapid GnRH frequency ( approx . 1 pulse/ hour ) favor LH secretion whereas slower GnRH stimulus ( 1 pulse/ 3 hour less ) favor FSH release . In normal woman , cyclical rise fall hormone level control follicular maturation ovulation . Early study show initial predominance FSH follicular phase , subsequent rise estradiol ( E2 ) . In late follicular phase , LH increase consequence increase GnRH secretion . Following ovulation , rise level E2 P reduce GnRH pulse frequency , allow rise FSH next cycle follicular maturation . One feature adult PCOS increase mean serum level LH increase LH pulse frequency , presumably due increase stimulation pituitary excess hypothalamic secretion GnRH . Since woman PCOS maintain high level LH low level FSH , follicle maturation ovulation occur normally . Girls hyperandrogenemia adolescence also increase frequency LH pulse compare age match control . If hyperandrogenemic adolescent could treat effectively pubertal maturation , development clinical PCOS adult could potentially avoid . One propose cause hyperandrogenemia PCOS defect GnRH pulse modulation , normally happen puberty progress . GnRH secrete part brain call hypothalamus . In normal pubertal maturation increase GnRH pulse secretion sleep stimulate LH ovarian E2 P secretion . Feedback hormone reduces GnRH pulse daytime hour , initiate cycle ovarian-hypothalamic feedback regulation mature pattern see normal ovulatory cycle . Recent study show E2 P slow LH pulse adult woman PCOS , high concentration P need inhibit LH pulse frequency . If hypothalamic ( GnRH pulse generator ) sensitivity inhibition P reduce pubertal maturation , low level P present initial development ovarian cyclicity may adequate suppress GnRH/LH pulse secretion . This could lead LH excess relative FSH deficiency . Administering oral dos P early adolescence may compensate restore normal ovarian-hypothalamic feedback . In turn , increase amount naturally secrete P subsequent cycle could eventually normalize system . The long term goal line investigation determine E2 P treatment adolescent hyperandrogenemia slow GnRH pulse generator promote FSH production advent normal menstrual cycle . As initial step propose determine GnRH pulse generator relatively insensitive E2 P inhibition hyperandrogenemic adolescent girl .</detailed_description>
