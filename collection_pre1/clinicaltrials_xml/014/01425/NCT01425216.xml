	<brief_summary>Treatment keloid disorder area unmet medical need . Current treatment keloid partially address small localized keloid , yet wholly satisfactory effective treatment patient extensive keloid . Such patient may benefit effective systemic treatment . Sorafenib potential regulate three know dysregulated biological pathway keloid tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dysregulation several intracellular pathway report various investigator . [ A ] Dysregulated apoptosis pathway : p53 mutation find hypertrophic scar keloid fibroblast culture cell various extent . p53 play central role DNA damage response induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death . Time course experiment make cell culture different time investigate phenomenon apoptosis involvement process pathological scar hypertrophic scar keloid indicate dysregulation apoptotic pathway Keloid tissue . [ B ] Dysregulated TGF- β signaling : Transforming growth factor- β1 ( TGF- β1 ) well know crucial fibrogenic cytokine promote ECM production tissue fibrosis keloid form [ 9 ] . TGF- β1 essential profibrotic cytokine collagen synthesis , well know increase mRNA expression procollagen I . Administration TGF- β1 result dramatic increase intracellular collagen I level keloid fibroblast . Due close relationship TGF- β signal production collagen , block TGF- β signal potential repress fibroblast proliferation collagen synthesis , thereby prevent formation keloid . [ C ] Dysregulated VEGF signal pathway : VEGF ( Vascular endothelial growth factor ) , one widely study secreted factor involve angiogenesis , implicate crucial normal pathological wound heal [ 18 ] . Gira et al . [ 19 ] indicate VEGF production abundant underlie dermis keloid . In vitro study indicate VEGF express high level keloid-derived Fibroblasts normal skin Fibroblasts . Sorafenib orally active multikinase inhibitor report effective inhibitor apoptosis , TGF-β signal VEGF pathway signaling , make ideal drug test set extensive keloid disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical Diagnosis keloid . 2 . Presence extensive keloid disease define section 1.3 3 . Age 18 50 4 . A sign informed consent document ( ICD ) 5 . Able willing receive sorafenib 6 . Patients must normal end organ marrow function Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . The effect sorafenib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential , men , must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation three month beyond last dose sorafenib . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 1 . Diastolic Blood pressure 90 mm Hg 2 . History degree hypertension , even medically control hypertension 3 . History form cardiovascular disease stroke 4 . History form thromboembolic event 5 . History renal dysfunction proteinuria , 6 . History form liver dysfunction 7 . History recent ( past 12 month ) plan ( next 9 month ) major surgery , 8 . Men woman plan child within 3 month last treatment 9 . Psychological Illness may result non compliance treatment 10 . Patients receive investigational agent . 11 . Patients history serious allergic reaction egg ( sorafenib formulate use egg phospholipid ) . 12 . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude possible pharmacokinetic interaction investigational agent . 13 . Patients swallow pill whatever reason exclude . 14 . Patients history current evidence bleeding diathesis . 15 . Patients take , take anticoagulant past 12 month reason . 16 . Pregnancy Breast Feeding Pregnant woman exclude study sorafenib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother sorafenib , breastfeed allow course study . Female patient advise get pregnant first 3 month last administer dose sorafenib . Men advise continue use barrier method contraception father child first 3 month last administer dose sorafenib</criteria>
