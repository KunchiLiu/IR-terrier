Evaluation immune response ASCI include , amonth others antiMAGE-A3 antibody response CD4+ CD8+ T cell response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Immune Response Stage IIB-IV Resected Melanoma After Treatment With MAGE-A3 ASCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label randomize single institution pilot study evaluate safety immunologic response MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic administer either two injection route ( i.m . i.d./s.c. ) . Patients study follow IRB approval ( IRB # 15398 ) documentation inform consent . The trial register clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01425749 ) , perform University Virginia . MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic ( 0.5 ml ) administer five time ( week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) extremity uninvolved melanoma . Vaccines 1 3 administer site : vaccine site rotate among available extremity . Subjects randomize 1:1 , within stratum ( AJCC stage II/III IV ) , i.m . ( Group A ) i.d./s.c . ( Group B ) administration . The randomization code generate study statistician use vary block size 2 4 . For group B patient , half dose injected s.c. , needle withdrawn dermis , advance intradermally puncture site remain half dose inject i.d . Immune response evaluate SIN PBMC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven melanoma meet one follow two criterion : Stage IIBIV melanoma render clinically free disease surgery , therapy , spontaneous remission within 6 month prior registration . Stage III IV melanoma disease . Patients may eligible definite equivocal finding persistent metastatic disease long finding meet RECIST criterion measurable disease . Expression MAGEA3 tumor ( primary metastasis ) . Patients may multiple primary melanoma . Patients may , may , metastasis cutaneous , mucosal , unknown primary site . Patients brain metastasis may eligible follow true : The total number brain metastasis ever less equal 3 . The brain metastases completely remove surgery treat completely stereotactic radiotherapy . Stereotactic radiotherapy , gamma knife , use 1 week prior study entry . There evident growth brain metastasis since treatment . No treated brain metastasis great 2 cm diameter time protocol entry . Patients must least two intact axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basin . The interferon education packet must complete satisfactorily eligible , refuse , interferon therapy . All patient must : ECOG performance status 0 1 . Ability willingness give inform consent . Laboratory parameter follow : 1 . ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 , Platelets &gt; 75,000/mm3 Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL 2 . Hepatic : AST ALT 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 x ULN LDH 2x ULN 3 . Renal : Creatinine 1.5 x ULN 4 . Serology : HIV negative ( antibody screening ) , Hepatitis C negative 5 . HGBA1C level &lt; 7.5 % Patients must 18 year old study entry Patients primary ocular melanoma . Patients brain metastasis unless meet criterion outline inclusion criterion Patients currently receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation , monoclonal antibody therapy , experimental therapy , receive therapy within precede 4 week . Patients currently receive nitrosoureas receive therapy within precede 6 week . Patients receive isolated limb infusion ( ILI ) isolate limb perfusion ( ILP ) melanoma eligible unless experienced tumor progression ILI/ILP , ILI/ILP perform within prior 12 week . Patients eligible clinically detectable melanoma deem likely investigator require intervention first 12 week study would require premature discontinuation . Patients know suspected allergy component MAGEA3 ASCI . Patients receive follow medication study entry within precede 4 week exclude , except specify : 1 . Agents putative immunomodulating activity , exception nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent topical steroid . 2 . Antibodies CTLA4 , PD1 , PDL1 , CD137 may receive past 12 week , patient eligible melanoma progression since therapy administer . 3 . Allergy desensitization injection . 4 . Systemic corticosteroid , administer parenterally orally . Inhaled steroid permit . Topical corticosteroid acceptable , include steroid low solubility administer nasally local effect . 5 . Any growth factor ( e.g . GMCSF , GCSF , erythropoietin ) . 6 . Interferon therapy . 7 . Interleukin2 interleukins . 8 . Targeted therapy design inhibit BRAF , MAPKinase , mTOR , signal pathway . Prior active immunotherapy vaccine melanoma may exclusion criterion circumstance . Exceptions exclusion criterion follow : 1 . Patients recur progressed either administration melanoma vaccine may eligible enroll study 12 week follow last vaccination . 2 . Patients may previously administer synthetic MAGEA3 protein , though prior vaccination 4 synthetic MAGEA3 peptide ( 16 amino acid length , ) allow . Pregnancy possibility become pregnant vaccine administration . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urinary serum betaHCG ) prior administration first MAGEA3 ASCI dose . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . Women must also breast feeding . This consistent existing standard practice vaccine chemotherapy protocol . Patients medical contraindication potential problem complying requirement protocol , opinion investigator . Patients classify accord New York Heart Association classification Class III IV heart disease . Patients body weight &lt; 110 lbs amount frequency blood drawn , biopsy require . Patients must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Patients active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . The following exclusionary : Laboratory evidence autoimmune disease ( e.g . positive ANA titer ) without symptom Clinical evidence vitiligo Other form depigmenting illness Mild arthritis require NSAID medication</criteria>
