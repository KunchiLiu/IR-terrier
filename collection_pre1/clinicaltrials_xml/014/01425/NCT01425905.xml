A major way type 2 diabetes occurs insulin resistance . Insulin resistance mean insulin ( important hormone body keep blood sugar normal ) work well , lead problem high blood sugar . Insulin resistance link mood problem , stress , depression , especially woman . To determine group program help reduce risk type 2 diabetes , researcher want look teenage girl risk develop disease . Objectives : To test whether group program design improve mood also help improve insulin resistance teenage girl risk develop type 2 diabetes , whether group program teach healthy living skill helpful . Eligibility : Teenage girl 12 17 year age risk develop type 2 diabetes . Design : - Participants two screen visit find eligible take part study . The first visit take 3 hour involve physical exam , medical history , questionnaires interview mood problem possible depression . The second visit take 6 hour involve full body scan measure muscle fat , blood draw glucose test determine insulin resistance , questionnaires general well-being eating habit , eat meal snack , exercise test . - Participants join one two group program National Institutes Health . One group focus learn skill help bad mood stress . The group cover topic important teen lead healthy life .

	<brief_title>Mood Insulin Resistance Adolescents At-Risk Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The alarm rise prevalence type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) among adolescent young adult pose enormous public health burden . Insulin resistance ( IR ) major physiological precursor T2D . Depressive symptom associate IR adolescent adult , predict adult-onset T2D , contribute increase risk T2D mortality morbidity . Depressive symptom theoretically induce IR promote stress-induced behavior ( altered eating , lower fitness ) upregulating physiological stress mechanism ( cortisol , NPY ) . Psychotherapy depression improve IR adult , unknown ameliorate depressive symptom prevents progression IR adolescent risk T2D . The aim protocol : 1 ) ass effect 6-week cognitive-behavioral ( CB ) depression prevention group ( Blues Program ) vs. 6-week standard-of-care health education ( HE ) group reduce depressive symptom improve IR adolescent girl risk T2D ; 2 ) ass stress-related behavioral physiological factor mediate relationship underlying decrease depressive symptom improvement IR ; 3 ) test genotypic variation NPY related severity depressive symptom IR moderate efficacy CB intervention . The propose study permit rigorous test degree depressive symptom contribute IR . The Blues Program brief , easy-to-administer , cost-effective , efficacious reduce depressive symptom among adolescent girl . If Blues Program also improve IR , would potential major impact T2D prevention considerable subset youth .</detailed_description>
