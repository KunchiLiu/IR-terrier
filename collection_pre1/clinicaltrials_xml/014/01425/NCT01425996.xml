	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy ( R/T ) locally advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) often use patient suitable transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) local therapy , especially portal vein tumor thrombosis ( PVTT ) cause tumor cell . Several previous study show local R/T tolerable induce substantial tumor response HCC management . In addition , safety , toxicity preliminary efficacy Lipotecan® ( TLC388 ) also prove patient terminal malignancy . This study aim evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy concomitant Lipotecan® radiotherapy patient locally advance HCC PVTT .</brief_summary>
