	<detailed_description>Carpometacarpal ( CMC ) arthritis thumb joint ( 'basal arthritis ' ) common entity treated hand surgeon society . It significant source functional disability secondary painful , often weak , grip . Once patient fail treatment conservative mean , splint , anti-inflammatory , cortisone injection , next option surgical management . Several surgical option available depend severity disease . For early stage arthritis option include ligament reconstruction metacarpal extension osteotomy . For advanced stage , salvage procedure exist . These include simple trapeziectomy , arthrodesis implant arthroplasty . The common procedure , however , trapeziectomy ligament reconstruction tendon interposition . During procedure arthritic trapezium excise remove arthritic joint surface , anterior oblique ligament reconstruct restore thumb metacarpal stability prevent axial shortening , fascial interposition perform reduce likelihood impingement neighbor bone . Postoperative rehabilitation splint protocol vary widely institution . In fact , study publish look specifically protocol . Some institution take conservative approach , patient immobilize mean twelve week motion six week . Others advance patient quickly start motion four week discontinuation splint eight week . There one Cochrane Review surgical treatment trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis compare seven surgical technique . They look outcomes pain , physical function , range motion , global assessment , strength , CMC image adverse effect . There mention therapy protocol.1 The Hand Clinics , comprehensive , state-of-the-art review expert field , provide current , practical information diagnosis treatment condition affect hand wrist . Each issue focus single topic relevant hand surgery practice . In recent arthritis issue , Clinics 26 ( 2010 ) , Bodin et al . discuss many surgical technique allude therapy eight week cast specific protocol define . 2 A recent book publication American Society Surgery Hand American Society Hand Therapists include chapter arthritis incorporate rehabilitation intervention follow soft tissue reconstruction CMC joint . They advocate conservative approach . Up four week forearm base thumb spica cast utilized thumb IP range motion edema control . At week 5 patient change forearm base thumb spica splint addition active range motion wrist thumb MP IP joint . CMC joint range motion start week 6 . At point isometric strengthen wrist , thenar first dorsal interosseous muscle initiate . At week 10 patient begin light pinch grip exercise . The splint discontinue week 12.3 Hand therapist find Diagnosis Treatment Manual Hand Rehabilitation Center Indiana 'bible ' hand therapy . They advocate aggressive , early motion , protocol . At week 2 , forearm base thumb spica cast splint place . At week 4 active passive range motion thumb wrist start include palmar radial abduction , wrist flexion , extension , ulnar radial deviation , thumb circumduction , flexion , extension . At week 6 , gentle strengthen begin discontinuation splint.4 A less popular frequently use book , Hand Upper Extremity Rehabilitation , practical guide , chapter Thumb CMC arthroplasty include concise protocol similar Indiana protocol . At week 2 , active passive MCP IP range motion start . At week 4 , CMC abduction extension , CMC opposition wrist range motion start . At week 8 , pinch grip strength stress . There discussion splinting . 5 Despite publish protocol , study look protocol well . There prospective , randomized trial compare conservative approach consist long immobilization aggressive approach advocate early motion shorter splint time .</detailed_description>
