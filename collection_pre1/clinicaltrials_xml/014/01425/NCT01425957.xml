	<brief_summary>THE STUDY WILL BE A TWO-PART RESEARCH PART A PART A extend : 1 . To implement `` common '' MRI acquisition protocol multiple center across Europe ( Pharma-COG partner ) . 2 . Apply common MRI protocol phantom human subject characterize , compare minimize test-retest variability across MR sit WP5 quantitative metric later assess patient . PART B : By collect clinical , biochemical , neuroimaging , neuropsychological neurophysiological data Mild Cognitive Impairment patient , aim : 1 . To develop biomarker MATRIX ( make combination biological secondary endpoint ) sensitive change observe loss hippocampal volume ( primary endpoint ) correlate neuropsychological progression conversion ( clinical secondary endpoint ) . 2 . To develop biomarker MATRIX ( make combination biological secondary endpoint ) baseline predictive loss hippocampal volume ( primary endpoint ) neuropsychological progression ( clinical secondary endpoint ) MCI patient . 3 . To harmonize biomarker MATRIX collection qualify multiple centre across Europe</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PART A : Participants ( ) healthy volunteer ( 50 80 year old ) and/or ( ii ) subject ( 50 80 year old ) , perform 3TMRI reason migraine , headache , auditory visual symptom , paresthesia , whose scan negative ( see exclusion criterion ) . Such subject select ask perform additional sequence accord part A study protocol . PART B : Specific inclusion criterion : 1 . Written Informed Consent participate 3 year imaging study 2 . Male female age 5590 year 3 . Memory complaint patient partner verify physician . ( Memory complains express patient informant examiner considers relevant exceed expect patient age . The patient may may symptoms deficiency cognitive area . ) 4 . Abnormal memory function document score 1 SD ageadjusted mean Logical Memory II subscale , ( Delayed Paragraph Recall ) Wechsler Memory Scale . 5 . General cognition functional performance sufficiently preserve diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease make site physician time screen visit . 6 . MiniMental State Exam score 24 30 ( inclusive ) 7 . Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5 . Memory Box score must least 0.5 . 8 . Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) ( pure amnestic multidomain ) 9 . Geriatric Depression Scale less 6 10 . Hachinski Modified Ischemic scale &lt; 4 11 . Patient untreated permitted medication ( Cholinesterase inhibitor memantine , enrolment newly prescription study , permit aMCI patient . ) 12 . At least 5 grade education 13 . Must speak ( language ) fluently 14 . Have study partner 10+ hr/wk contact ( person telephone ) , accompany visit 15 . Willing able comply requirement study , judge investigator PART A : 1 . Ischaemic lesion already detect previous scan 2 . Head injury loss consciousness &gt; 24 hour 3 . Current substance abuse 4 . Current therapy steroid current chemotherapy 5 . Loss weight &gt; 5 kg last 6 month 6 . Systemic disease frequent involvement CNS ( lupus , HIV , rheumatoid arthritis ) 7 . CNS disease diagnose specialist treatment ( epilepsy , ictus ) 8 . Cerebral metastasis CNS primary tumour still benign ( except pituitary microadenoma ) 9 . Suspected multiple sclerosis + MRI evidence white matter lesion 10 . Suspected recent stroke + MRI evidence infarct 11 . Aneurysm &gt; 10 mm arteriovenous malformation ( except venous angioma ) 12 . Dysgenesia central nervous system PART B : 1 . Visual auditory acuity inadequate neuropsychological test 2 . Enrolment trial study compatible study objective ( particular , experimental drug ) 3 . History significant neurological psychiatric illness presence disease preclude enrolment . 4 . Use forbidden medication 5 . Ferromagnetic implant device eligible MRI scanning . Brain malformation condition may complicate lumbar puncture 6 . Excluded Medication : Antidepressants anticholinergic property within 4 week screening : Regular use narcotic analgesic ( &gt; 2 dos per week ) , Use neuroleptic anticholinergic property ( e.g. , chlorpromazine , thioridazine ) , Chronic use medication significant central nervous system anticholinergic activity ( e.g. , diphenhydramine ) , Use AntiParkinsonian medication ( include Sinemet , amantadine , bromocriptine , pergolide , selegiline ) , Participation investigational drug study ( individual may participate drug study participate protocol ) . Diuretic drug start discontinue within 4 week prior screen ( Any change diuretic medication study report ) .</criteria>
