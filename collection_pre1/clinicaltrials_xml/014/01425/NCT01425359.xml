	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect ranolazine compare placebo average weekly angina frequency subject chronic stable angina coronary artery disease ( CAD ) history type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , whether ranolazine reduce frequency angina ( chest pain ) attack , compare placebo . Subjects asked record daily angina episode diary end study day . Ranolazine approve treatment chronic angina , approve treatment T2DM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants meet eligibility criterion screen enter 4-to 6-week Qualifying Period . The allowed concomitant antianginal medication ( ) must maintain stable dose throughout study . Participants document number angina episode , number sublingual nitroglycerin dose take , dyspnea score ( scale 1 5 ) daily basis diary . Participants eligible stay study Qualifying Period enter 8-week double-blind dose phase . Participants study visit end Weeks 2 8 . Participants continue document number angina episodes number sublingual nitroglycerin dose take well dyspnea score daily basis end day diary . In addition , participant call Week 2 end Week 5 encourage compliance . A safety follow-up phone call make 14 day last study visit early discontinuation .</detailed_description>
