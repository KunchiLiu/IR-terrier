	<detailed_description>This pivotal , prospective , multi-center randomized , control , open-label clinical study design compare performance safety AirXpander Tissue Expander System currently clear saline tissue expanders . Subject meet inclusion agree participate study enrol randomize either investigational arm ( AirXpander Tissue Expander ) control arm ( standard saline tissue expander ) use 2:1 ( AirXpander saline ) permute block randomization stratify investigational center procedure ( unilateral bilateral ) . If subject bilateral procedure , type expander implant side . Subjects arm follow manner explantation tissue expander ( ) exchange permanent implant ( ) .</detailed_description>
