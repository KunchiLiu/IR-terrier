	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab ( hR3 ) humanize monoclonal antibody recognize epitope locate extra cellular domain human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . In phase II clinical trial combination Nimotuzumab chemotherapy radiation therapy achieve satisfactory therapeutic outcome patient advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck , glioblastoma . We therefore postulate Nimotuzumab combination conventional definitive chemotherapy might improve rate disease control ( RDC ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival patient recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN , poor-prognosis patient population currently standard treatment approach , design trial test hypothesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nimotuzumab Combination With TPF ( Cisplatin , Fluorouracil Docetaxel ) Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient randomly assign use permutated block designed11 site receive either Nimotuzumab combine docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil regimen ( Arm A ) docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil alone regimen ( Arm B ) . Combination arm chemotherapy conduct follow . Since day 1 , Nimotuzumab ( 200 mg , give 2-hour intravenous infusion chemotherapy , Biotech Pharmaceutical Inc. , Beijing , China ) administrate 1 h chemotherapy week two successive course , follow docetaxel ( dose 75 mg per square meter body-surface area ) administer 1-hour intravenous infusion , follow intravenous cisplatin ( 75 mg per square meter ) , administer period 0.5 3 hour . After completion cisplatin infusion , fluorouracil ( 1000 mg per square meter per day ) administer continuous 24-hour infusion 4 day . Patients arm A received docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil only.One treatment cycle comprise period 3 week ( 21 day ) . Patients receive six cycle treatment arm , unless disease progression unacceptable toxicity observe . Patients experimental group least stable disease could choose continue maintenance Nimotuzumab every week disease progression , intolerable toxicity , study withdrawal .</detailed_description>
