	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor currently Phase 3 clinical development treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . DTG primarily metabolize UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT1A1 ) cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 pathway minor route . Corticosteroids demonstrate induction effect UGTs CYP3A4 . Corticosteroids often use HIV-infected subject potential reduce DTG exposure due enzyme induction co-administered . The primary objective study determine whether concomitant prednisone administration affect pharmacokinetics ( PK ) DTG . The study two part , two period , open label study . Part 1 evaluate effect high prednisone dose DTG PK potential additional Part 2 depend result Part 1 . In Part 1 , approximately 12 healthy subject receive DTG 50mg q24h 5 day Period 1 . Subjects administer DTG 50mg q24h combination prednisone 60mg 5 day follow 5 day taper ( total duration 10 day ) Period 2 . PK data DTG obtain Part 1 use inform decision make need Part 2 . If DTG exposure reduce 50 % Part 1 , Part 2 carry second cohort subject receive DTG 50mg q24h DTG 5 day Period 1 follow DTG 50mg q24h combination prednisone 20mg 5 day follow 5 day taper ( total duration 10 day ) Period 2 . Safety evaluation serial PK sample DTG collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . All dos study drug take follow moderate fat meal . This study conduct one center United States , healthy adult male female subject .</brief_summary>
