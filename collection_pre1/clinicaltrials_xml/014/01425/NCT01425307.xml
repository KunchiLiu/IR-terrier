	<brief_summary>The primary goal Phase III TWiTCH trial compare 24 month alternative therapy ( hydroxyurea ) standard therapy ( transfusion ) pediatric subject sickle cell anemia abnormally high ( ≥200 cm/sec ) Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) velocity , currently receive chronic transfusion reduce risk primary stroke . For alternative treatment regimen ( hydroxyurea ) declare non-inferior standard treatment regimen ( transfusion ) , adjust baseline difference , hydroxyurea-treated group must mean TCD velocity similar observe transfusion prophylaxis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) With Transfusions Changing Hydroxyurea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite clear result STOP follow-up STOP II trial , use chronic erythrocyte transfusion primary stroke prevention child Sickle Cell Anemia ( SCA ) remain controversial many practice hematologist , well patient family . Transfusions proven clinical efficacy prevent first stroke child SCA abnormal TCD velocity , indefinite use may still difficult justifY . The risk transfusion acquire iron overload recognize serious consequence chronic erythrocyte transfusion child SCA . After one two year monthly transfusion , virtually every patient excess hepatic iron deposition warrant intervention chelation therapy . The effectiveness iron chelation yet realize , despite availability oral chelator deferasirox ( Exjade® ) , due lack palatability increase recognition serious drug-related toxicity include renal hepatic dysfunction . Simply put , indefinite erythrocyte transfusion view adequate acceptable long-term therapy primary stroke prevention SCA . There urgent need develop equivalent effective alternative therapy prevention primary stroke child SCA , specifically one good manage iron overload improve quality life .</detailed_description>
