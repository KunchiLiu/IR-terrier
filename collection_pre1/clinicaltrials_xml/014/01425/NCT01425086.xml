	<brief_title>Clinical Performance Embrace Isothermal Mattress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim use result pilot study preparation large , longer , multi-center clinical trial test performance Embrace Isothermal Mattress wean premature infant incubator open crib ( thermal weaning ) . Specifically , study would provide physiological data ( e.g . temperature , weight ) operational experience ( e.g . logistical issue , familiarity technology ) would assess short-term effectiveness ( &lt; 24 hour ) new technology maintain temperature stability well inform subsequent trial . This study build upon two primary body scientific knowledge : ( 1 ) applicability isothermal mattress supplemental heat source thermal weaning ( 2 ) basic clinical knowledge quality , quantity , time warm thermal wean process . First , current thermal weaning process LPCH heavily dependent upon prolong use incubator . Additional source warm include radiant warmer , transwarmers ( e.g . one-time use gel-packs ) , skin-to-skin contact ( e.g . Kangaroo Mother Care ) , others . While provide sufficient warm thermal weaning always ideal ( e.g . incubator separate mother baby , radiant warmer transwarmers vary ability stabilize temperature prolong period , skin-to-skin contact constantly available ) . In contrast , Embrace Isothermal Mattress base wax-like phase-change-material ( PCM ) allow extremely stable long-term heat exchange infant . It design function without constant source electricity relatively portable allow use supplement incubator , skin-to-skin contact , warm technique . Secondly , study inform future clinical practice specifically thermal wean generally neonatal temperature regulation . Thermal wean occurs incubator 's set temperature incrementally lower nurse preparation transition open crib . Eventually , clinical decision make clothe infant turn incubator ( base upon physiological marker nurse experience ) . A period observation clothe infant within switched-off incubator ( immediate 12 hour base survey LPCH nurse ) precedes transition open crib . A series retrospective chart review observe range thermal weaning practice within LPCH-affiliated nursery possibly due wide interpretation exist thermal weaning protocol ( e.g . wean different post- menstrual age , physiological characteristic , cognitive development ) . The investigator hopeful study provide additional scientific data inform clinical decision-making thermal weaning . Ultimately , research perform pilot study subsequent clinical trial determine whether Embrace Isothermal Mattress may facilitate optimal transition infant incubator open crib . For example , infant find transition effectively low body weight post-menstrual age still maintain temperature stability use Embrace Isothermal Mattress , clinicians offer alternative thermal wean method additional secondary benefit . Specifically , early transition may facilitate early mother-child bonding improve infant 's quality life ultimately lead advanced developmental stage upon discharge PICN . In addition , use new technology alternative weaning may free incubator life-threatening case , ultimately provide efficient cost-effective use PICN resource . Therefore , end goal improve overall clinical practice patient experience introduce evaluate potentially beneficial warm technology .</detailed_description>
