	<detailed_description>CBD stone define occurrence stone bile duct . CBD stone usually cause biliary pain jaundice , whereas obstruction develop gradually several month may manifest initially pruritus jaundice alone . Unlike stone gallbladder , CBD stone cause symptom , tend present life-threatening complication cholangitis acute pancreatitis . Given propensity result serious complication , choledocholithiasis warrant treatment nearly case In 2010 , guideline risk treatment choledocholithiasis publish . The predictive variable seem cholangitis , bilirubin level high 1.7 mg/dL , dilate CBD US . The presence 2 variable result high probability CBD stone . Advanced age ( old 55 year ) , elevation liver biochemical test result bilirubin , pancreatitis le robust predictor choledocholithiasis . There various way non invasive image diagnosis CBD stone . The sensitivity transabdominal US conventional compute tomography ( CT ) detection biliary stone variable , range 20 % 80 % 23 % 85 % , respectively . MRCP sensitivity 92-93 % , specificity 97-98 % . Although MRCP excellent diagnosis , sensitivity reduce 33-71 % diagnosis small stone ( less 5mm ) An ERCP traditionally consider evaluation biliary-tract disease . This modality sensitive ( 90 % ) specific ( 98 % ) detecting CBD stone . EUS diagnosis CBD stone report widely vary sensitivity 71 % 100 % specificity 67 % 100 % . Some paper report intraductal ultrasound ( IDUS ) sensitive ( 97-100 % ) . However , expensive require fully-experienced endoscopist , , difficult use . In recent year , endoscopic sphincterotomy stone extraction standard procedure removal bile duct stone . After procedure , complication stone recurrence , papillary stenosis , cholangitis liver abscess . These recurrent symptomatic bile duct stone , despite increase experience success procedure , occur 4 % 24 % patient . Retained stone define incomplete stone removal ERCP , otherwise recurrent stone define recurrence stone complete stone removal . A criterion distinguish two stone rediscovery time ERCP stone removal . Typically , bile duct stone find 6 month endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) generally consider recurrent , oppose retain Gallbladder stone , pneumobilia many various factor know associated CBD stone recurrence . Lithotripsy also relate development recurrent stone . It natural small stone fragment leave lithotripsy may act nidi stone recurrence . For reason , many study reduce residual recurrence CBD stone perform . Before procedure , MRCP , CT EUS perform identify exact location stone . Many study demonstrate residual stone clearance ENBD , EUS IDUS immediately ERCP stone removal useful reduce recurrence . However , cholangiogram ENBD use EUS ERCP stone removal increase duration hospital stay , cost patient 's discomfort . Until , non-invasive , time reduce , cheap simply way unknown . Recently , two different study publish . Using IDUS could effectively find residual CBD stone persist EST balloon basket extraction . Furthermore , normal saline irrigation CBD stone removal appear useful clear residual small stone . These procedure could reduce retain recurrent stone Another study show additional IDUS confirm complete stone clearance ERCP basket stone removal significantly decrease early recurrence rate common bile duct stone . These study demonstrate small remain stone could completely detect use ERCP stone removal remain stone removal reduce residual recurrent stone . Saline irrigation effective immediately ERCP stone removal remove remain small stone . However , prospective study saline irrigation without EUS IDUS reduce recurrent CBD stone ERCP stone removal yet . Saline irrigation many advantage easy treatment ERCP stone removal , almost additional cost rare side effect . This study The author expect study remarkable role ERCP stone removal procedure .</detailed_description>
