	<brief_title>MK2206 Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Biliary Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete partial response ) , define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion , patient advance refractory biliary cancer ( BC ) receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 ( MK2206 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event tolerability regimen patient advanced refractory BC receive MK2206 . II . To determine overall progression-free survival patient advance refractory BC receive MK2206 . III . To determine presence genetic mutation PI3-kinase/ Akt pathway signaling-pathway gene relevant BC correlate objective response treatment MK2206 . IV . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacogenetic profile way assess inter-individual variability well relate clinical outcome . V. To determine genetic variant mutation gene encode drug-metabolizing enzyme transporter , gene involve tumor biology , may relate response treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetic , correlative study . Previously collect tumor tissue also analyze . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
