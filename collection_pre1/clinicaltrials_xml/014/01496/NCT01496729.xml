This pain commonly treat opioids , cause several side effect , range pruritus , impaired vigilance , concern severe respiratory depression . This aggravated recipient accumulation opioid metabolites secondary renal impairment secretion . Several study show opioid spar effect transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block surgery low abdomen . In proposed study , plan compare impact ultrasound guide single shot transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block versus ultrasound guide sham block normal saline ( placebo ) postoperative pain score , postoperative opioid consumption , well patient 's satisfaction .

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year , English speaking , receive kidney transplant donate kidney part standard clinical care Allergy local anesthetic opioids , coagulopathy dementia . Patients known history IV drug abuse high preoperative opioid requirement ( define &gt; 120 mg oxycodone/ day , use methadone fentanyl patch ) also exclude study . Coagulopathy assess patient 's history physical . Should concern regard `` easy bleeding '' `` easy bruising '' , workup patient 's coagulation order ( PT , PTT , INR ) . Since perform TAP block 34 hour kidney surgery , patient coagulopathy likely cancel prior surgery . Therefore , would deem patient , eligible kidney surgery , eligible TAP block end surgical procedure .</criteria>
