	<brief_summary>Iodine-123 label ortho-Iodohippuric Acid ( [ I-123 ] -OIH ) use early 1970 's kidney imaging agent tracer `` lights-up '' inside body scan , year use decline . The commonly used tracer Technetium-99m label Mercaptoacetyltriglycine ( [ Tc-99m ] -Mertiatide [ Tc-99m ] -MAG3 ) . However , long-term shortage may threaten supply radioactive substance Tc-99m Canada world . As result shortage , need identify type tracer use image . [ I-123 ] -OIH may alternative . The purpose study examine diagnostic performance characteristic [ I-123 ] -OIH comparison [ Tc-99m ] -MAG3 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Centre Open Label Comparison I-123-Ortho-Iodohippuric Acid ( OIH ) With Tc-99m-Mercaptoacetyltriglycine ( MAG3 ) Assessment Renal Tubular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct compare two image agent ( tracer ) : [ I-123 ] -OIH [ Tc-99m ] -MAG3 use gamma camera image participant different level kidney function . Gamma camera image non-invasive nuclear scan use look organs tissue inside body . An imaging agent tracer radioactive chemical intravenously inject body light cell , tissue organ . The study evaluate safety single injection [ I-123 ] -OIH compare image result calculate renal function value ( use blood test ) [ Tc-99m ] -MAG3 . 90 participant require complete study .</detailed_description>
