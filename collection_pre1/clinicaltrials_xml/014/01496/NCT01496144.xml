	<brief_summary>Background : Models try explain driving mechanism behind chronic non specific low back pain ( CNSLBP ) order propose good appropriate conservative treatment . Altered responses spinal and/or supraspinal level may affect perception pain degree disability CNSLBP patient . Recent clinical recommendation still propose active exercise ( AE ) CNSLBP . However , acceptance exercise patient may limit pain-related manifestation . Current evidence suggest manual therapy ( MT ) induce short-term analgesic effect neurophysiological mechanism peripheral , spinal cortical level . The aim study first , assess whether MT instant analgesic effect , second , compare long-lasting effect functional disability MT follow AE sham therapy ( ST ) follow AE . Methods : Forty-two CNSLBP patient without co-morbidities , randomly distribute 2 treatment group , receive either spinal manipulation/mobilization ( first intervention ) plus AE ( MT group ; n = 22 ) , detuned ultrasound ( first intervention ) plus AE ( ST group ; n = 20 ) . Eight therapeutic session deliver 4 8 week . Instant analgesic effect obtain measure pain intensity ( Visual Analogue Scale ) immediately first intervention therapeutic session . Pain intensity , disability ( Oswestry Disability Index ) fear-avoidance belief ( Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ) determine treatment , 8th therapeutic session , 3- 6-month follow-up .</brief_summary>
