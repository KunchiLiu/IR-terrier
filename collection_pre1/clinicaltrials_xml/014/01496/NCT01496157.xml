	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) , [ 18F ] DCFBC ( DCFBC ) , PET image biomarker prostate cancer detection aggressiveness initial diagnosis . PSMA well characterize histological marker prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness quantitative non-invasive method PSMA detection monitor currently available . Development image biomarker would useful differentiate indolent aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes allow selection appropriate risk adaptive therapy . The investigator preliminary first-in-human study demonstrate high specific DCFBC uptake metastatic prostate cancer feasibility prostate cancer imaging . The investigator propose study patient initially diagnose biopsy-positive prostate cancer determine DCFBC uptake location PET image positively correlate prostate cancer prostatectomy tissue step-section analysis . DCFBC uptake site suspect metastatic disease compare conventional imaging modality ( CT , bone scan ) biopsy result available . In addition , DCFBC-PET uptake quantification compare expression level PSMA prostate cancer relevant marker ( PSA , Ki-67 , TMPRSS2-ERG ) prostate tissue immunohistochemistry analysis compare clinical prognostic marker ( PSA , Gleason score , clinical stage , Partin table derive prediction pathologic stage ) .</brief_summary>
