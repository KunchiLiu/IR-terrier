	<brief_summary>The overarch aim proposal examine effect usual protein diet supplement keto acid ( KA ) insulin sensitivity patient peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) . The investigator achieve goal randomize control trial administration usual protein diet plus KA versus usual protein diet alone patient peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) period 6 month . If successful , result study provide potential avenue improvement metabolic profile patient PD possibly improve long-term outcome cardiovascular disease risk death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Significance : To evaluate effect KA plus usual protein diet basal stimulate insulin sensitivity PD patient . Hypothesis : Administration KA plus usual protein diet improve insulin resistance peritoneal dialysis patient . To evaluate influence KA plus usual protein diet non-traditional cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) marker ( marker inflammation oxidative stress ) PD patient . Hypothesis : Administration KA plus usual protein diet improve marker inflammation oxidative stress PD patient . Background Rationale : Insulin Resistance Peritoneal Dialysis Patients . Insulin resistance ( IR ) , reciprocal insulin sensitivity , describes state reduce biological effect give concentration insulin plasma . Insulin resistance play major pathophysiological role glucose intolerance Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) tightly associate major public health problem include obesity , hypertension , dyslipidemia , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . Insulin resistance , measure homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA-IR ) , report common chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient , include one PD hemodialysis ( HD ) . HOMA-IR also show independent predictor cardiovascular mortality non-diabetic maintenance HD patient although pathophysiological link clearly delineate . A unique aspect PD predispose patient IR inevitable glucose load dialysate require ultrafiltration . Consequently , prevalence metabolic syndrome hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia weight gain increase PD patient . As individual component metabolic syndrome , IR significantly high PD patient HD pre-dialysis patient ( 47 % vs 21 % 26 % ) . Accordingly , improvement IR could potential intervention decrease CVD risk mortality PD patient . However , investigation center intervention ameliorate IR patient . Low Protein Diet Supplemented Keto Acid Potential Strategy Ameliorate Insulin Resistance PD Patients . Several small scale study explore effect low protein diet ( LPD ) plus KA glucose metabolism indicate LPD-KA could improve liver peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity CKD patient yet maintenance dialysis . There study explore effect maintenance dialysis patient , especially PD patient . One potential mechanism improvement insulin resistance KA reduction circulate uremic toxin , although specific element well delineate . In addition , supplementation KA might helpful since plasma total branched-chain amino acid concentration correlate glucose tolerance index dialysis patient . Since safety LPD entirely show previous study PD patient , data indicate DPI &lt; 0.74g/kg/d harmful long-term PD , investigator provide LPD improve IR . However , exploration possible benefit KA plus usual protein intake PD patient insulin sensitivity intriguing .</detailed_description>
