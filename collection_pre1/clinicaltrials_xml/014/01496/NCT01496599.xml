	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson disease ( PD ) cause slow movement , stiffness , tremor . It result loss brain chemical call dopamine . PD get bad time , researcher fully understand brain cell produce dopamine stop work die people PD . This study use different way image brain brain chemical look PD . It compare brain image people definitely PD people might PD people without sign PD . It provide information brain people PD change time . Objectives : - To understand change occur brain people Parkinson disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age definite possible Parkinson disease . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen visit physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center year 9 year . There 10 total visit . Most visit last 5 6 hour day 2 3 day . Some following test perform visit : - Transcranial sonography , use sound wave take picture brain . - Magnetic resonance image take picture brain . Some test do rest . Others require participant perform activity scan . - Dopamine image study show brain us chemical dopamine . - Magnetoencephaolgraphy show brain activity . - Electromyography show muscle activity . - Medication withdrawal 12 hour overnight people take PD medication . This may do scan . Participants feel unwell stop take medication allow start take . - Participants continue followup visit end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The purpose protocol evaluate possible biomarkers diagnosis assessment disease progression Parkinson disease ( PD ) multi-modal neuroimaging study . The study two part : 1 . Part 1 : Compare brain image PD subject healthy volunteer ( HVs ) use various image technique case-control analysis . 2 . Part 2 : Compare find serial brain image clinical assessment PD subject , subject early parkinsonism healthy volunteer follow 9 year . The finding exploratory study help develop additional hypothesis-driven study investigate PD pathology . PD patient yield information biomarkers change time ; patient early parkinsonism give information biomarkers might predict development PD . Study Population : Part 1 ( Case-control study ) : We study 30 patient well-defined PD , define UK Parkinson Society Brain Bank diagnostic criterion . We also study 15 age-matched healthy volunteer ( HVs ) control . Part 2 ( Longitudinal study ) : We continue study subject Part 1 periodically follow 9 year . We also study 30 subject early parkinsonism ( EP ) . EP subject define individual experience least one few 3 cardinal symptom PD time enrollment . Design : Part 1 : ( Case-control study ) . Eligible participant come 1 3 day visit . They clinical assessment , magnetic resonance ( MR ) scan , may also dopamine transporter single photon emission compute tomography ( DAT SPECT ) scan , brain ultrasound ( transcranial sonography TCS ) and/or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . Subjects Parkinson medication may 2-3 additional MR scan medication condition tolerate . Part 2 : ( Longitudinal study ) . Subjects invite follow-up every 3 year total 3 additional visit . Each follow-up involve 1 3 day visit consist repeat clinical evaluation core image study , may include additional imaging study ( TCS , SPECT , MEG , MR scan ) . Patients disease duration le 5 year follow every 18 month 5th year disease . Outcome Measures : 1 . MRI : To measure difference susceptibility iron-rich structure ( use susceptibility weight image ) ; difference fractional anisotropy seed target region interest ( use DTI ) ; difference gray white mattervolume brain region ( use VBM ) ; fluctuation blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signal rest state ( use fMRI ) ; Permeability blood brain barrier DEC MRI ; signal amplitude phosphorus-containing compound neurotransmitter brain region interest ( ROIs ) ( use MRS ) . 2 . TCS : To measure parameter difference area increase signal ( hyperechogenicity ) see brain structure substantia nigra ( SN ) . 3 . SPECT : To measure amount dopamine reuptake striatal part brain . 4 . MEG : To quantify measure task-related potential , relative spectral power , synchronization .</detailed_description>
