	<brief_summary>Background : - Buspirone drug approve treatment anxiety adult . Studies suggest buspirone might act part brain increase certain level brain activity . Increasing brain activity may help decrease epileptic seizure come certain part brain . Researchers want see buspirone reduce seizure frequency people seizure already take antiseizure medication . Objectives : - To test whether buspirone reduce frequency seizure people whose seizure seem start one part brain . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age seizures come one place brain . - Participants must try least two different antiseizure medication . They must also least three seizure 1-month observation period current medicine . Design : - Participants screen visit physical exam medical history . Participants complete mood memory test scale . Blood , urine , saliva sample collect . - Participants magnetic resonance image scan evaluate brain structure relate epilepsy . They also positron emission tomography scan look part brain affect buspirone . - Participants start take study drug ( either buspirone placebo ) twice daily . They keep calendar seizure record side effect . Treatment monitor clinic visit blood sample . - After 12 week study drug , participant gradually stop take either placebo buspirone two week . They stay drug another 2 week . - After 2 week , participant start take study drug opposite one . They keep calendar seizure record side effect . Treatment monitor clinic visit blood sample . - After 12 week study drug , participant gradually stop take either placebo buspirone . - Participants final followup visit additional blood test , mood memory test scale image study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To initiate pilot clinical trial assess safety , tolerability efficacy 5HT1A receptor agonist buspirone patient localization-related epilepsy . Buspirone 5HT1A receptor agonist approve treatment anxiety disorder . Patients localization-related epilepsy reduce 5HT1A receptor bind 18FCWAY positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Increasing neurotransmitter activity 5HT1A receptor site may ameliorate seizure . STUDY POPULATION : Forty patient localization-related epilepsy DESIGN : A randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over , phase II clinical trial . The trial screen phase patient undergo physical neurological examination , standard blood test , follow one month baseline phase . At end baseline , patient qualify neuropsychological , anxiety , mood evaluation , FCWAY PET MRI ( image perform already ) . During subsequent first study phase , patient randomize buspirone match placebo . After completion first study phase , patient cross alternate study arm . At end study , patient wish may remain open-label buspirone . OUTCOME MEASURES : 1 . Difference seizure rate compare 3 month placebo active study phase 2 . Neuropsychological , anxiety , mood index compare 3 month placebo active study drug phase</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients may male female . Patients age 18 65 Patients must least 3 seizure onemonth baseline . Localizationrelated epilepsy diagnose standard clinical criterion respond treatment two standard antiepileptic drug either sequentially combination . Patients must able provide inform consent Patients must able remain baseline AED drug dose throughout study Patients must able use seizure calendar record seizures throughout trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant patient participate study . During study , woman childbearing potential must use reliable method birth control pregnancy test throughout protocol . Use alcohol recreational drug start two week enter baseline duration study . Patients medication potential clinically significant interaction buspirone , include MAO inhibitor , clozapine , zolpidem , hypnotic , hydromorphone derivative , oxycodone , diltiazem . Current treatment psychiatric disorder depression , anxiety bipolar disorder . Patients diagnosis schizophrenia . Current treatment another significant medical disorder , diabetes , heart disease , untreated disorder , might interfere study .
