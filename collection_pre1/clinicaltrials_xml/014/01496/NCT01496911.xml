They first descend 2 min pressure 4 bar ( 30 mt ) , stay 20 min , dive continue ascend pressure 2 bar ( 10 mt ) another stay 20 min . At depths 20 min period measure period perform test . At end go surface accord decompression profile stop 3 min 9 mt , 8 min 6 mt 23 min 3 mt . These decompression stop regular profile necessary prevent decompression sickness.Before diving , 2 4 bar , test measure attention , memory , psychomotor , concentration comprehension ability participant conduct .</detailed_description>
