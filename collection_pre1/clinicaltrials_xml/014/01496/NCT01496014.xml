	<brief_title>Assessment Severe Extremity Wound Bioburden Time Definitive Wound Closure Coverage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection remain common significant complication follow high energy fracture . The strategy use prevention deep infection follow severe open fracture wound remain constant past 20 year . This project design analyze microbiology profile wound severe tibia fracture closure compare two method : routine microbiology technique PCR method use Ibis T5000 Biosensor System . The result identification method compare pathogen associate deep surgical site infection occur post closure wound . Currently unknown method yield information low complication rate better function leg . Our goal perform multi-center , prospective cohort study wind bacterial bioburden associate antibiotic care severe open low extremity fracture . Primary Aim : In subset 60 patient , compare bioburden , detect Ibis technology , three sample technique ( deep tissue ; soft tissue composite ; composite tissue length depth wound ) . Samples obtain use effective technique identify step process use Ibis subsequent tissue analysis . Effectiveness define ability identify key wound infection-causing pathogen . Primary Hypothesis : The composite sampling approach effective technique . Secondary Aim : Characterize wound bioburden time definitive wound closure coverage use Ibis T5000 Biosensor System PCR technology compare standard microbiology technique . Hypothesis 2 : The Ibis technology detect specie pathogens standard microbiology technique . The percent patient Ibis detect specie identify standard microbiology great 95 % . Specific Aim 3 : Characterize wound bioburden patient develop deep infection within one year wound closure , determine association infect pathogen initial wound closure bioburden measure jointly Ibis standard microbiology technique . Specific Aim 4 : Document variability antibiotic selection duration , examine impact selection subsequent deep infection . Hypothesis 4a : Among patient treat antibiotic regimen appropriate pathogen identify standard microbiology , low probability deep infection among patient receive inappropriate antibiotic regimen . Hypothesis 4b : Among patient treat antibiotic regimen appropriate pathogen identify Ibis , low probability deep infection among patient receive inappropriate antibiotic regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All open Grade III tibia fracture ( plateau , shaft , pilon ) require second procedure follow fixation , traumatic transtibial amputation require delay primary closure , skin graft and/ flap coverage . 2 . Ages 18 64 year inclusive 3 . Patients may risk factor infection include diabetes , immunosuppression steroid medication , HIV , infection . 4 . Patients may traumatic brain injury . 5 . Patients may fracture include spine , upper extremity fracture , contralateral low extremity injury , ipsilateral pelvis , hip , femur foot injury . 6 . Patients may treat initially outside institution prior transfer study institution , long definitive fixation perform prior entrance study . 7 . Patients bilateral injury meet inclusion criterion may include , limb rat `` severe '' treat surgeon enrol study . 8 . Patients may coexist nontibial infection , without antibiotic treatment . 9 . Patients may exist infection surgical wound treatment time wound closure . 10 . Patients may definitively fix use method ( nail , plate , ex fix ) 11 . Patients may fasciotomy 1 . Patient speak neither English Spanish 2 . Patient prisoner 3 . Patient diagnose severe psychiatric condition 4 . Patient intellectually challenge without adequate family support 5 . Patient live outside hospital 's catchment area 6 . Patients plan followup another medical center</criteria>
