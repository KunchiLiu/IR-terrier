	<brief_summary>Background : - To understand disease retina eye , information need people without disease . Researchers want study people follow time . They also want study body tissue blood understand nature eye disease . Studying gene , cell , tissue may help understand people get eye problem others , people respond treatment others . Researchers want collect physical sample personal data develop National Eye Institute database . Objectives : - To collect health information blood tissue sample people without eye disease , use research study . Eligibility : - Individuals age different type eye disease . - Healthy volunteer history eye disease . Design : - Participants may recruit National Eye Institute study may refer source . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also full eye exam . Questions ask family medical history , especially eye disease . - Blood sample collect . Other sample , saliva , tear , hair , stool , urine , may collect need . Adult participant may also provide skin sample . - Tissue fluid eye collect part eye care treatment may also add database . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study establish clinical database biospecimen repository identification novel factor relevant pathogenesis , progression , response treatment variety retinal condition , particularly age-related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy , associate systemic correlate disease . Objectives : This study provide standardized collection longitudinal clinical data serial collection , processing , storage variety biospecimens . The clinical data set biospecimen repository use identify novel genetic factor , biomarkers , experimental model associate pathogenesis , progression , response treatment various condition retina associate systemic correlate disease . Study Population : We plan accrue 500 participant age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , 300 participant diabetic retinopathy , 1,000 participant retinal disease , 500 participant without retinal disease . Design : This prospective observational study multiple retinal disease suitable control incorporate : 1 . Standard care management eye diseases standardized follow-up testing schedule ; 2 . Collection biospecimens research purpose sample incur minimal risk participant . Outcome Measures : Outcome measure include interaction key parameter phenotype ( visual acuity retinal feature ocular image ) genetic variant biomarkers identify biospecimens , characterization new experimental model eye health disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : 1 . Have ability understand sign inform consent parent/legal guardian minor child . 2 . Manifest diagnose undiagnosed retinal disease could serve unaffected control . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : 1 . Are unable unwilling give inform consent include collection study least one peripheral blood sample . 2 . Are unable unwilling give inform consent include use NIH medical record clinical sample research relate vision diseases affect eye . 3 . Are unable unwilling manage clinically indicate . 4 . Have systemic disease compromise ability provide adequate ophthalmologic examination treatment . The eligibility requirement protocol intend broadly inclusive , individual find ineligible may evaluate NEI Screening Protocol ( 08EI0102 ) potential participation study . Adults unable understand sign inform consent exclude study frequently unable cooperate evaluation test manner standardize adult participant .</criteria>
