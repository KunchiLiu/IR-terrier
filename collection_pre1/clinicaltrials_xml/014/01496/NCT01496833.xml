	<brief_title>Total Endovascular Aortic Arch Re-construction Study ( TEARS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysms dissection involve ascend aorta aortic arch historically treat open surgical technique , require cardiopulmonary bypass deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) . Despite increase experience refinement procedure , remain substantial rate morality morbidity . Total endovascular aortic arch ascend aorta repair one ultimate solution disease . However , approach require extensive technique new device development . The goal total endoluminal stent graft re-construct ascend aorta aortic arch cover primary entry tear dissection remodel aorta.Recently , branch fenestrated stent-grafts developed treat complex ascend aortic arch disease , previously consider contraindicated endovascular repair . This study aim investigate short mid term efficacy safety newly-developed branched stent graft patient complex aortic lesion , ascend aortic/arch aneurysm , pseudo-aneurysm , Stanford Type A dissection , retrograde Stanford Type B dissection , dissection primary tear locate aortic arch , et al . Primary outcome measure all-cause mortality . Secondary outcome variable include conversion stent and/or surgery , induced thrombosis false lumen , cardiovascular morbidity , aortic expansion ( &gt; 5 mm/y maximum diameter include true false lumen ) , quality life , length intensive care unit hospital stay . The study design enroll 50 patient monitor 24 month .</detailed_description>
