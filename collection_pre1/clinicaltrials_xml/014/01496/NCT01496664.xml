	<brief_summary>The purpose registry ass result combine operative catheter base ( hybrid procedure ) treatment patient significant coronary artery disease use essential clinical angiographic parameter . Based exist literature expect result coronary artery bypass graft anterior descendent coronary artery ( LAD ) , segment 1 2 , use so-called mammary artery graft , superior stent treatment artery . At time catheter base intervention use balloon , bare metal stent ( BMS ) drug elute stent ( DES ) seem well treatment saphenous vein graft coronary artery LAD . I.e . right coronary artery ( RCA ) leave circumflex coronary artery ( CX ) . Therefore , expect combination mention surgical catheter base technique well treatment bypass operation catheter base intervention alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Hybrid Revascularisation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 150 consecutive patient include study . The patient coronary artery narrow locate LAD , treat mammary graft , stenosis locate coronary artery ( RCA CX ) , treat balloon stent . The patient include study recruit patient refer Department Cardiology/Department Thoracic Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby treatment significant coronary artery disease . We announce patient , patient receive honorarium participation . The first 100 patient treat two seance ; operation stent treatment day interval . The last 50 patient treated hybrid operation room operation stent treatment seance .</detailed_description>
