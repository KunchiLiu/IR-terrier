	<brief_summary>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Versus Drug Eluting Stent Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty Treatment Unprotected Left Main Stenosis . In clinical , randomize , 5-year follow-up study compare essential clinical outcome parameter patient unprotected leave main ( LMCA ) disease , treat coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) versus percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) use drug elute stent ( DES ) . DES-PCI unprotected LMCA disease non-inferior CABG concern 2-year rate death , myocardial infarction , stroke new revascularization concern 5-year rate death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Randomised open multicentre trial . Patients : Number 1,200 Randomisation : PCI DES v CABG Individuals inclusion recruit among patient refer participate center LMCA treatment . The patient recruit advertise receive honorarium participation . Primary secondary endpoint assess independent endpoint committee ( IEC ) . The endpoint committee consist experience cardiac surgeon cardiologist . Follow-up All patient see outpatient clinic participating center one month 1 , 2 ,3 ,4 5 year . The outpatient visit may substitute telephone contact subsequent investigation documentation possible study event ( MACCE ) . Finally , 10-year registry assessment total mortality . The index angiogram assess QCA-laboratories Department Cardiology , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby , Denmark . The left main lesion non-left main lesion describe classified SYNTAX SCORE calculate . The angiography obtain PCI-procedure use index angiography . There least two cine-runs procedure procedure angulation proceed 0.1 mg intracoronary nitroglycerine ( documented angiogram ) . The diagnostic/guiding catheter well visible , near center angiogram fill dye . The index lesion well visible , near centre angiogram show without foreshorten . There angulation difference two baseline angiogram least 30 degree . Between pre post angiogram balloon inflation stent implantation document short cine-runs . Statistics data management : The statistical analysis perform Department Clinical Epidemiology , Aarhus University Hospital . Analysis population : The result analyze accord intention-to-treat principle , i.e . patient randomize certain group follow assessed irrespectively actual treatment . Protocol violation note responsible center notify . Sample size calculation : Primary endpoint 2-year MACCE Sample size calculation base combined primary endpoint death , stroke , non-index treatment relate MI new revascularization ( PCI CABG ) 2 year . The study plan non-inferiority study , experimental treatment disease ( E , PCI ) compare standard treatment ( S , CABG ) . E allow clinically insignificantly inferior S declare non-inferior . Calculations base follow : - mean follow-up time 24 month - event curve exponential - zero dropout - randomization 2 equally size group - α = 0.05 ( one-sided ) - 1- β ( power ) = 80 % The non-inferiority limit base 12 month MACCE rate 12 % CABG 16 % PCI group ( SYNTAX study ) . With exponential event curve ( S ( ) =exp ( -λ*t ) ) correspond hazard ratio 1.36 , PCI versus CABG , , month , λ=0.0107 CABG group . In continuation , present study use hazard ratio 1.35 , E versus S , limit non-inferiority , λ=0.011 describe MACCE CABG group . These figure correspond 24-month MACCE rate 30 % 23 % PCI CABG group , respectively . The precondition assumption result necessary number patient randomization group 593 ( total number event - group - 275 ) . Consequently , 1,186 patient randomize . By include 600 patient group , possible dropout follow-up treatment estimation error account . Data management The study report Danish Data Protection Agency , agency 's guideline data management follow . Dedicated case record form use faxed PCI research , Cardiac Cath . Lab. , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby , 8200 Aarhus N , Denmark . Data store Access database double data entry use quality control . There log access attempt access . Back-up data original data encrypt . Monitoring study : The study monitor accord GCP rule independent professional . During study period , monitor regular contact participate department ensure trial conduct compliance protocol , GCP applicable regulatory requirement . The monitor ensure use product right review source document verification consistency data record CRFs . The monitor also provide information support investigator ( ) . Investigators responsible personnel must available monitoring visit , audit inspection devote sufficient time process . The investigator provide CV equivalent documentation suitability responsible trial . All investigator responsible personnel list together function trial signature list . Publication : Results , positive well negative , publish international cardiovascular journal . Publication author issue decide steer committee basis general involvement study ( draft protocol , core lab . function , endpoint committee membership , etc . ) number include patient . Thus , sequence author determine inclusion rate participate centre include centre offer position first author .</detailed_description>
