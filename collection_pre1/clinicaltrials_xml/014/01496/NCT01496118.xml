	<brief_summary>Relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) incurable disorder poor prognosis . Carfilzomib novel proteasome inhibitor activity set . Panobinostat pan-deacetylase inhibitor show synergistic cytotoxicity vitro vivo proteasome inhibitor . The combination enhance activity agent myeloma cell . In Phase I , optimal dos combination carfilzomib panobinostat determine . Assuming combination feasible , Phase II portion proceed use dos determine Phase I .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Panobinostat Carfilzomib Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open-label , non-randomized Phase I/II study , maximum 4 plan dose level carfilzomib panobinostat evaluate determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) administer . The MTD reach patient Phase II receive treatment dose level 4 ass efficacy . Response treatment evaluate 4-week cycle . Those objective response stable disease continue treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . As MTD 4 plan dose level reach , parallel Phase I study initiated examine additional dose level use traditional 3+3 design . If dose level tolerable , patient recruit expansion cohort ass efficacy new dose level ( ) .</detailed_description>
