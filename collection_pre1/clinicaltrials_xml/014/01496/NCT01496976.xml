	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see ofatumumab methylprednisolone follow additional treatment ofatumumab lenalidomide help people Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) get rid CLL long period time . Researchers also want find combination ofatumumab methylprednisolone follow additional treatment ofatumumab lenalidomide safe tolerable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Ofatumumab/Methylprednisolone Followed Ofatumumab/Lenalidomide Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single institution , non-randomized study patient untreated CLL/SLL , utilize two-stage trial design . The primary endpoint trial combine complete partial response rate ( 3 months-the end cycle 3 ) protocol therapy . We anticipate trial complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) rate least 80 % . A two-stage design employ trial . The null/unacceptable CR+PR response rate ≤ 60 % anticipated true response rate protocol treatment least 80 % disease cohort . At first stage , 26 patient accrue trial . If 15 few patient respond , trial terminate early response rate protocol treatment deem unacceptable ( ≤ 60 % ) . Otherwise , 15 patient respond first stage , additional 19 patient enrolled trial stage 2 total 45 patient . If 32 few 45 patient respond protocol treatment end stage 2 , investigation protocol treatment consider warrant . On hand , 32 patient 45 enrolled patient respond , protocol treatment consider promising . If true response rate ≤ 60 % , probability end trial stage 1 0.48 . If , however , true response rate least 80 % , probability end trial stage 1 0.01 . This two-stage design overall alpha level 0.045 power 0.90 .</detailed_description>
