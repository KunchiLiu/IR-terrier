	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives To assess efficacy combination gemcitabine , taxotere , xeloda ( GTX ) cisplatin subject metastatic pancreatic cancer base progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month . Secondary Objectives - To assess safety characterize toxicity combination GTX cisplatin subject metastatic pancreatic cancer . - To estimate 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 month disease control rate ( DCR ) , PFS , overall survival ( OS ) . Study Design This study single arm phase II study ass efficacy GTX cisplatin subject metastatic pancreatic cancer . Approximately 38 evaluable subject enrol , 28 initial cohort 10 expansion cohort The study safety run-in phase consist 6 subject . To ensure combination safe , first six subject treat DL1 observe limit toxicity first 2 cycle continuation accrual . After safety run-in , study continuously monitor adverse event . The primary endpoint PFS rate 6 month , define proportion subject alive , free disease progression 6 month . The treatment regimen would consider insufficient activity study population PFS rate 6 month 50 % less , minimum required level efficacy would warrant study propose regimen 75 % PFS rate 6 month . The study design include interim monitoring futility use predictive probability approach . We stop study early give information interim analysis , unlikely PFS rate 6 month great 50 % study continue end .</brief_summary>
