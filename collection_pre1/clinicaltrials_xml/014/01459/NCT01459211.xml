	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish safety efficacy combination dexamethasone lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) ( D+L ) subject relapse refractory CLL fail unable tolerate standard up-front therapy regimens contain Fludarabine mutation p53 gene , CAMPATH-1H .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Establish Safety &amp; Efficacy Combination Dexamethasone Lenalidomide Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study plan ass safety tolerability combination dexamethasone , lenalidomide ( D+L ) patient relapse refractory CLL , subgroup limit treatment option . Lenalidomide offer alternative way treat CLL . In Phase 1 safety pharmacokinetics study ( study 1398/180 ) healthy male volunteer , demonstrate lenalidomide administer dose 100 mg twice day 6 day acceptable safety profile grade 1-2 rash pruritus primary adverse event associate administration compound . In myeloma MDS , lenalidomide study mostly two dos : 25 mg/day 10 mg/day . In CLL significant toxicity observe two dose level , include tumour lysis syndrome tumour flare.47,48 We therefore plan start therapy lenalidomide relatively low dose 5mg/day , day 1-28 , cycle 1 escalate maximum dose 10mg/day cycle 2-12 . We elect administer lenalidomide continuously oppose pulse 14-21 day cycle reduce risk tumour flare reaction ( TFR ) , agent reintroduce cycle . Finally , lenalidomide administer combination Dexamethasone , dose 20mg/day 4 day 28 day cycle allow convenient oral administration . We others demonstrate Dexamethasone level effective CLL patient refractory relapse follow primary Fludarabine therapy . The combination D+L likely reduce toxicity , especially TFR , whilst improve overall efficacy without promote emergence chemoresistant clone tumour suppressor gene inactivate .</detailed_description>
