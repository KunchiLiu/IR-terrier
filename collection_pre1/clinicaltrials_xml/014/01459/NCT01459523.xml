	<brief_summary>Continuous peripheral nerve block ( CPNB ; also know `` perineural '' catheter ) provide target-specific pain control variety surgery . There increase interest use ultrasound guidance regional anesthesia , many technique use ultrasound alone perineural catheter insertion describe . Catheters may place various point along brachial plexus ( upper extremity procedure ) proximity femoral and/or sciatic nerve ( low extremity procedure ) . To date , optimal ultrasound scan technique , catheter insertion endpoint , catheter placement location per indication , majority ultrasound-guided continuous peripheral nerve block remain unknown . This study help provide important information relate optimal ultrasound scan technique help identify way improve success rate , onset time , analgesic effectiveness technique real patient undergo surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Catheter Insertion Technique Ultrasound-guided Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To determine optimal scan technique ultrasound-guided perineural catheter insertion result accurate tip placement proximity target nerve plexus . Secondary Aim : To determine optimal location ultrasound-guided perineural catheter insertion along target nerve plexus result maximum local anesthetic infusion benefit .</detailed_description>
