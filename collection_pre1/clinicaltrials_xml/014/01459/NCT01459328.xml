	<detailed_description>This phase III randomise clinical trial compare outcome two different neo-adjuvant radiation base treatment locally advance rectal carcinoma . This encompass patient risk positive circumfrential resection margin ( CRM+ ) baseline assessment image pateints identify T-descriptor T4 baseline assessment . The arm compare follow : - The investigational arm : short chemo-radiation course ( 25Gy 5 daily fraction 1 week ) +/- surgery . - The conventional arm : protracted chemo-radiation course ( 50Gy 25 daily fraction 5 week combine chemotherapy ) +/- surgery . The outcome include four domain : overall survival , biological effect , quality life health-related economics .</detailed_description>
