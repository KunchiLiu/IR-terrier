	<detailed_description>An Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator ( ICD ) device implant patient 's chest monitor heart rhythm deliver shock terminate potentially lethal arrhythmias necessary . While ICDs reduce sudden cardiac death , patient device eventually die , either heart failure chronic disease . As patient 's disease worsen , physiologic change ( intrinsic extrinsic heart ) may affect cardiac conduction system , lead arrhythmias increase frequency shock . Because ICD shock cause pain anxiety may prolong life acceptable quality , appropriate consider ICD deactivation patient 's clinical status worsen death near . However , conversation rarely occur . The investigator propose conduct randomize clinical trial physician-centered patient counsel support intervention improve communication cardiologist patient ICDs . The goal study determine effectiveness intervention : 1 ) increase conversation ICD deactivation , 2 ) increase number patient device deactivate , 3 ) improve mental health outcome bereave caregiver decease patient . The unit randomization hospital , intervention aim cardiologist , unit analysis patient . The investigator create network six academic medical center across country . The intervention deliver consists three part . First , PI conduct workshop communication specific ICD-deactivation cardiologist intervention center . Second , enrol patient admitted hospital see outpatient setting , cardiologist receive two reminder ( one via email , one patient chart ) patient appropriate conversation ICD deactivation . Finally , cardiologist receive aggregate feedback number conversation conduct data patient ' satisfaction conversation every six month . Physicians usual care hospital receive didactic lecture advance care planning . All patient surrogates interviewed baseline assess regular interval determine outcome : 1 ) prevalence conversation ICD deactivation report patient/surrogate ; 2 ) frequency patient device deactivate . Caregivers continue interview regular interval 6 month patient dy determine relationship intervention caregiver mental health outcome . Given exponential increase number patient ICDs , intervention potential improve quality care thousand patient near end life family .</detailed_description>
