	<brief_summary>Background : - Cushing disease cause tumor pituitary gland , small gland size pea locate base brain . These tumor produce high level hormone , cause obesity , diabetes , growth problem . The cure type Cushing disease surgery remove tumor leave pituitary gland alone . Currently , magnetic resonance imaging scan best way find tumor . However , many tumor show scan . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan use radioactive chemical light part body active , tumor . Researchers want try make small Cushing disease tumor active help show scan . A special hormone give scan make tumor active . Objectives : - To test use hormone stimulation improve brain scan Cushing disease tumor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 8 year age surgery remove Cushing disease tumor . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , image study . - They three brain scan surgery . The first scan magnetic resonance image scan show full picture brain . The second third scan PET scan . - The first PET scan give without special hormone . The second PET scan do 24 hour less 14 day first PET scan . The second PET scan give special hormone . - Participants tumor removal surgery another study protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Preoperative imaging identification localization adrenocorticotropin hormone ( ACTH ) -secreting pituitary adenomas critical accurate diagnosis successful surgical treatment Cushing disease ( CD ) . Unfortunately , 40 percent CD patient visible pituitary adenoma magnetic resonance ( MR ) -imaging ( sensitive image modality ACTH-positive adenoma detection localization ) . Lack MR-imaging diagnosis guide surgical resection result significantly high rate surgical failure compare case associate adenomas visible MR-imaging . Because ACTH-adenomas metabolically active compare surround pituitary gland , ( 18 ) F-fludeoxyglucose ( ( 18 ) F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) -imaging CD patient could use detect adenomas detectable MR-imaging . Moreover , corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) give selectively increase metabolic activity ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma increase likelihood detection localization ( 18 ) F-FDG PET-imaging . To determine effect CRH stimulation ( 18 ) F-FDG uptake use PET-imaging CD , perform ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging ( without CRH stimulation ) CD patient . Study Population Thirty male female CD patient 8 year old participate study . Study Design This single center trial determine effect CRH stimulation ( 18 ) F-FDG uptake high-resolution PET-imaging ACTH-adenomas CD patient . CD patient undergo ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging without CRH stimulation ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging intravenous CRH stimulation . The order PET scan randomize second PET scan occur great 24 hour less 14 day initial PET-imaging . For ( 18 ) F-FDG PET-imaging CRH stimulation , intravenous ( 18 ) F-FDG give CRH administration . The PET image read radiologist blind administration CRH . Within 12 week completion last ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging scan , patient undergo surgical resection pituitary adenoma . Surgical histological confirmation adenoma location use assess diagnostic localization accuracy PET-imaging compare preoperative MR-imaging result CD patient . Inferior petrosal sinus sampling ( IPSS ) result compare imaging result surgical histological finding . Outcome Measures The primary objective study determine effect CRH stimulation ( 18 ) F-FDG uptake high-resolution PET-imaging CD . To assess compare ( 18 ) F-FDG uptake without CRH stimulation , compare ( 18 ) F-FDG standardized uptake value ( SUVs ) region interest ( pituitary gland pituitary adenoma ) . Secondary objective include determine CRH stimulation enhances detection ACTH-adenomas demonstrate ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging assess accuracy sensitivity ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging detection ACTH-adenomas compare MR-imaging . Measures assess secondary objective include compare ( 18 ) F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging ( without CRH stimulation ) detection ( 1 ) MR-imaging detection adenoma , ( 2 ) IPSS result , ( 3 ) actual tumor location confirm histological finding location predict PET- MR-imaging within patient .</detailed_description>
