	<brief_title>High Dose D-Serine Adjuvant Treatment Recent Onset Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Recent advance understand neurobiology underlying schizophrenia underscore pivotal role specific receptor neurotransmitter glutamate , NMDA receptor , whose function may impair disorder . Enhancing transmission NMDA receptor may therefore provide novel mechanism treat schizophrenia . Over past decade clinical trial include supplementation different compound enhance transmission NMDA receptor provide positive result , particularly D-serine . However , none trial focus specifically young patient recent onset schizophrenia . In addition , optimal D-serine dose determine , although preliminary report suggest high dos use study may provide additional benefit , without significant safety concern side effect . Also , pro-cognitive effect D-serine systematically analyze , although preliminary data support potential role D-serine ameliorate cognitive deficit find schizophrenia . Research Design : Over two year period , 54 patient , male female , age 18-30 year fulfill DSM-IV criterion schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , enter 12 week , parallel group , double blind , randomize control trial assess efficacy placebo vs. DSR ( 6000 mg/day ) augmentation standard antipsychotic therapy . First episode patient , patient treat clozapine , randomize separately . Patients enter trial accordance strict inclusion exclusion criterion nature study explain give write informed consent . Clinical evaluation perform baseline regular interval trial . In addition , neurocognitive evaluation , electrophysiological assessment determination amino acid level conduct begin end study . Treatment emergent adverse effect monitor .</detailed_description>
