	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dos ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity two different regimen ABT-888 ( veliparib ) administer carboplatin PLD ( Doxil , Lipodox ) ( pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ) recurrent , platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . To assess toxicity regimen use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . III . To examine tolerability treatment regimens combination bevacizumab MTD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate ( complete partial ) patient measurable disease . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine relationship platinum-free interval , activity ABT-888 ( objective response rate ) measure breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 ( BRCA1/2 ) status include mutation , alteration , rearrangement , promoter methylation , immunohistochemical expression ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . REGIMEN I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . REGIMEN II : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-28 , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride carboplatin Regimen I. BEVACIZUMAB : Once MTD veliparib determine , patient also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow quarterly 1 year .</detailed_description>
