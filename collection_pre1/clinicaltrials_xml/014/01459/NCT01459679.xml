Patients age 18 need sign assent form well parent legal guardian sign inform consent ; 3 . Willingness ability follow instruction comply schedule followup visit ; 4 . For female capable become pregnant , agree urine pregnancy test perform prior randomization study eye day fellow eye treatment ( occur 3 6 month study eye visit ) ; must lactate , must agree use medically acceptable form birth control least one week prior randomization visit continue use method one month last dose test article . Acceptable form birth control spermicide barrier , oral contraceptive , injectable implantable method contraception , transdermal contraceptive , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization partner . For nonsexually active female , abstinence consider acceptable form birth control . Women consider capable become pregnant include female experience menarche experience menopause ( define amenorrhea great 12 consecutive month ) undergo successful surgical sterilization ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) ; 5 . BSCVA ≥1 letter ≤80 letter ETDRS chart ; 6 . Presence central inferior steepen topographic map ; 7 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Removal contact lenses require 1 week period prior screen visit ( ) ; 8 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : manifest refraction must stable two visit occur least 7 day apart . A stable refraction one manifest refraction spherical equivalent average K ( Km ) topographer take first visit differ 0.75 D respective measurement take second exam ; Inclusion Criteria ( keratoconus subject ) : 9 . Have maximum corneal curvature measure Kmax ≥ 47.00 D ; 10 . Having topographic evidence keratoconus diagnosis mild , moderate severe keratoconus define follow : Mild Keratoconus 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus 2 . Flat keratometry read ≤ 51.00 D topography map Moderate Keratoconus 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus 2 . Flat keratometry read ≥ 51.01 D ≤ 56.00 D astigmatism ≥ 8.00D topography map Severe Keratoconus : 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus mark area steepen 2 . Flat keratometry read ≥ 56.01 D topography map Inclusion Criteria ( corneal ectasia subject ) : 11 . Having diagnosis corneal ectasia refractive surgery ; 12 . Having axial topography consistent ectasia ; Exclusion Criteria ( subject ) : 1 . Contraindications , sensitivity know allergy test article ( ) component ; 2 . If female , pregnant , nurse plan pregnancy positive urine pregnancy test prior randomization treatment either eye course study ; 3 . Corneal pachymetry &lt; 375 micron prior epithelial debridement thin point eye treat ; 4 . Eyes aphakic ; 5 . Eyes pseudophakic UV block lens implant ; 6 . Previous ocular condition ( refractive error ) eye treat may predispose eye future complication . For example : 1 . History corneal disease ( e.g. , herpes simplex , herpes zoster keratitis , recurrent erosion syndrome , corneal melt , corneal dystrophy , etc . ) 2 . Clinically significant corneal scar crosslinking treatment zone relate keratoconus corneal ectasia , investigator 's opinion , interfere crosslinking procedure ; 7 . A history delay epithelial healing eye ( ) treat ; 8 . Patients nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze treatment diagnostic test ; 9 . Patients current condition , investigator 's opinion , would interfere prolong epithelial healing ; 10 . Taking Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) supplement within 1 week crosslinking treatment . 11 . A history previous corneal crosslinking treatment eye treat ; 12 . Have use investigational drug device within 30 day study concurrently enrol another investigational drug device trial within 30 day study ; 13 . A history previous corneal surgery ( LASIK PRK subject corneal ectasia ) insertion Intacs eye ( ) treat ; 14 . A history previous Limbal Relaxing Incision ( LRI ) procedure eye ( ) treat ; 15 . In addition , Investigator may exclude discontinue subject sound medical reason ; Exclusion Criteria ( Keratoconus subject ) : 16 . Eyes classify either normal , atypical normal , keratoconus suspect severity grade scheme .</criteria>
