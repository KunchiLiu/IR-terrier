	<brief_summary>Background : Millions people year sustain injury , tumor surgically remove , born defect require complex reconstructive surgery repair . In case hand , forearm , arm amputation , prostheses provide less optimal motor function sensory feedback . However , hand arm transplantation mean restore appearance , anatomy , function native hand . Although 70 hand transplant perform date good functional result achieve , widespread clinical use limit due adverse effect life-long high-dose immunosuppression need prevent graft rejection . Risks include infection , cancer , metabolic problem , greatly affect recipient ' quality life , make procedure risky , jeopardize potential benefit hand transplantation . Study Design : This non-randomized , Phase II clinical trial document use new immunomodulatory protocol ( aka - Pittsburgh Protocol , Starzl Protocol ) establish hand transplantation safe effective reconstructive treatment upper extremity amputation minimize maintenance immunosuppression therapy unilateral bilateral hand/forearm transplant patient . This protocol combine lymphocyte depletion donor bone marrow cell infusion enable graft survival use low dos single immunosuppressive drug follow weaning treatment . Initially design living-related solid organ donation , regimen adapt use graft donate deceased donor . The investigator propose perform 30 human hand transplant employ novel protocol . Specific Aims : 1 ) To establish hand transplantation safe effective reconstructive strategy treatment upper extremity amputation ; 2 ) To reduce risk rejection enable allograft survival minimize requirement long-term high dose multi-drug immunosuppression . Significance Research : Hand transplantation could help upper extremity amputee recover functionality , self-esteem , capability reintegrate family social life `` whole '' individual . The protocol offer potential minimizing morbidity maintenance immunosuppression , thereby beneficially shift risk/benefit ratio life-enhancing procedure enable widespread clinical application hand transplantation .</brief_summary>

Viral encephalitis . Toxoplasmosis . Malignancy ( within past 5 year ) . Current/recent ( within 3 month donation/screening consent ) IV drug abuse . Paralysis ischemic traumatic origin . Inherited peripheral neuropathy . Infectious , post infectious , inflammatory ( axonal demyelinating ) neuropathy . Toxic neuropathy ( i.e . heavy metal poisoning , drug toxicity , industrial agent exposure ) . Mixed connective tissue disease . Severe deform rheumatoid osteoarthritis limb . Conditions , opinion study team , may impact immunomodulatory protocol potentially expose recipient unacceptable risk immunosuppressive treatment . Sensitized recipient high level ( 50 % ) panelreactive HLA antibody . Conditions may impact success surgical procedure increase risk postoperative complication include inherited coagulopathies like Hemophilia , VonWillebrand 's disease , Protein C S deficiency , Thrombocythemias , Thalassemias , Sickle Cell disease , etc . Mixed connective tissue disease collagen disease result poor wound heal surgery . Conditions may impact functional outcome include Lipopolysaccharidosis amyloidosis ( may impact nerve regeneration ) rare disorder bone heal like osteopetrosis . Patients consider unsuitable per consult Psychiatrists appraisal .</criteria>
