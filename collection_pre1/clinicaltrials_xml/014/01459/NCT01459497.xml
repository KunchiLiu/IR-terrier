	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiation Therapy ( IGRT ) Patients With Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design determine whether accelerated course hypofractionated radiation therapy daily image guidance motion assessment/control allow effective treatment poor performance status patient stage II-III NSCLC , would benefit local therapy compare standard radiation therapy ( 60 Gy 2 Gy per fraction ) . Poor performance status patient heterogeneous group , tumor-related factor , co-morbidities , advanced age place patient category . These patient traditionally underrepresented clinical trial , thus prospective study evaluate efficacy radiotherapy dose fractionation patient . One phase III trial `` poor-risk '' locally advanced NSCLC ( RTOG 93-04 ) include 40 % Karnofsky performance status 60-70 patient show median survival time 9.5 10.3 month 60Gy conventional radiation therapy alone recombinant β-interferon [ 18 ] . 1 year overall survival 44 % patient . This study include randomization two arm . Arm A ( experimental arm ) include IGRT , 60 Gy 15 fraction ( 3 week ) . Arm B include conventional radiation , 60-66 Gy 30-33 fraction ( 6 week ) optional concurrent carboplatin/taxol . The experimental arm dose trial base dose escalation trial University Texas Southwestern evaluate maximum tolerate dose hypofractionated IGRT patient population ( Phase I study IRB # 072010-050 ) . Doses escalate 3 Gy per fraction ( total dose 45 Gy ) 4 Gy per fraction ( total dose 60 Gy ) evaluation treatment relate toxicity perform . Critical structure dose constraint express organ dose-volume limit , limit formulate approval study investigator use know tolerance data , radiobiological conversion model , norm use current practice academic center [ 27 ] . Randomization Schema : Patients allocate treatment use randomize permuted block within stratum balance patient factor institution . The stratifying variable Zubrod performance status ( 2 vs. &gt; 2 ) stage ( II vs. III ) .</detailed_description>
