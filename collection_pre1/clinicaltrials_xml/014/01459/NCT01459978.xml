	<detailed_description>1 . RATIONAL Quality improvement become central tenet health care . In obstetrics gynaecology department , admission may affect health one , two individual , make high quality care particularly important . In addition , woman admit obstetric reason healthy individual goal full preservation health . Measurement play important part improve quality care promote beneficial change . Therefore , last decade much effort go develop use measure quality . The first step towards measure quality care obstetrical department select quality indicator . Conventional quality indicator severe event maternal death neonatal death . However , advance obstetrical management make event extremely rare , quality indicator must seek . Once quality indicator identify , best mean monitoring must determine . The use statistical method monitor control process , know Statistical Process Control ( SPC ) , seem particularly promising monitoring quality indicator . SPC use rigorous time-series analysis method , whose result report graph change outcome rate time . Moreover , SPC help determine whether change real ( i.e. , related causative factor ) merely manifestation natural variability . Among SPC tool , CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) chart widely use industrial quality control find effective measure monitoring healthcare outcome . In obstetrics , Cumulative Sum ( CUSUM ) chart use monitor Apgar score performance sonographers assess nuchal translucency first trim pregnancy . Despite Establishing Cumulative Sum ( CUSUM ) chart relevant quality indicator hold considerable promise continuously assess improve quality care , nowadays , study assess impact CUSUM chart mother child health . The published study use CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) see behaviour indicator , exploit Cumulative Sum ( CUSUM ) SPC ( statistical process control ) tool 2 . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : assess impact Cumulative Sum ( CUSUM ) chart use maternity dashboard decrease maternal neonatal mortality morbidity Secondary objectives - select consensual set quality indicator ass overall quality obstetrical care could routinely monitor maternity unit . - estimate acceptable unacceptable rate quality indicator - ass Satisfaction caregiver propose tool - assess patient satisfaction care maternity 3 . OUTCOMES Primary outcome Indicator mother health : composite outcome take account multiple clinical event : 1 . - mortality , 2 . - complication pre-eclampsia - Hemolysis , Elevated Liver enzyme , Low Platelet syndrome ( HELLP ) : - Disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) eclampsia retro-placental hematoma , 3 . - postpartum hemorrhage : 4 . - severe bleed 5 . - thromboembolism : Phlebitis Pulmonary embolism 6 . - postpartum infection 7 . - severe perineal injury 8 . - need intensive care transfer woman Indicator newborn health : composite outcome mortality morbidity . Morbidities take account several clinical event : 1 . - postnatal death ( 8days 1 month ) 2 . - prematurity : medical spontaneous 3 . - low birth weight 4 . - maternal-fetal infection : occur first hour life 5 . - Transfer neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) 6 . - chromosomal abnormality absence screen 7 . - malformation without screen diagnostic Secondary outcome Care giver satisfaction Women satisfaction 4.STUDY POPULATION - Participating Center : Ten Maternity department France participate study - Eligibility criterion Inclusion Criteria - All delivery study period : Regardless mode delivery : vaginal delivery , cesarean section , spontaneous induced delivery Regardless pregnancy term - Women follow first trimester pregnancy concern maternity - New born study period Exclusion criterion - Pregnancies end fetal death UTERO pregnancy termination medical reason 5.STUDY DESIGN It Step-wedge cluster-randomized , prospective multicenter study , evaluate impact continuous monitoring quality indicator use CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) chart , health mother newborn 10 participate center . The advantage design intervention roll individual cluster phase design may require few cluster parallel CRCT design . CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) set center , quality indicator previously select , delayed onset disseminate result CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) group 2 . A Delphi survey international expert panel obstetrical care use develop set main quality indicator follow routinely maternity . The basic performance maternity evaluate first period data collection order perception performance maternity . As show Figure 1 , study conduct three phase : Phase 1 : 3 month test observation period . During phase , rate quality indicator select collect adjust acceptable unacceptable rate set practitioner maternity . Phase 2 : In phase , maternity randomly assign one follow group : group result CUSUM provide period 12 month ( Early CUSUM result group ) , group result CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) share . Phase 3 : In phase , maternity ward `` early result group '' continue receive result CUSUM period 12 month , maternity second group receive CUSUM result ( CUSUM result Delayed group ) period 12 month . At end study period , maternity `` early result group '' receive result CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) 24 month period , maternity `` Delayed CUSUM result group '' receive CUSUM result period 12 month . 6.STUDY STEPS 1 . A modified Delphi Survey international multidisciplinary panel select quality indicator A modify Delphi survey conduct involve international expert panel . The Delphi technique structure process widely use quality indicator development . One main reason popularity enjoy Delphi technique large number individual across diverse location area expertise include anonymously interact directly , situation group dominate view certain individual avoid . The modified Delphi technique define , among , combine use self-administered questionnaire physical meeting expert enhance complex decision make process clarify language recommendation . The panel member ask rate quality indicator 2 criterion : validity feasibility . Validity define extent characteristic indicator appropriate concept assessed quality indicator consider feasible information need ass adherence think available medical record patient simple collect source whatsoever workload consistent activity maternity . These rat along 9 point scale , score 1 ( definitely valid feasible ) 9 ( definitely valid feasible ) . 2 . Estimating acceptable unacceptable rate quality indicator : Maternity obstetricians ask define acceptable unacceptable rate quality indicator accordance actual performance , activity local need . For quality indicator , acceptable rate define rate beyond corrective action need unacceptable rate rate beyond audit need identify cause change performance thereby allow corrective action . 3 . Intervention describe follow : Step 1 : Implementation CUSUM control chart use available medical data Step 2 : Submission monthly result coordinator participate center ( CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) result period ) . Step 3 : When alarm generate , steer committee meet maternity staff find cause alert propose corrective measure . 7 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size calculation Sample size calculation base follow assumption : - incidence mortality / morbidity : 40 per 100 - Maternity activity 1 year period : 3000 births average per center . - A decrease event 30 % In cluster randomize trial , outcome individual within cluster independent . The sample size increase take account effect . The required increase influence ICC size cluster . The investigator must increase standard sample size inflation factor equal [ ( 1 + ( n-1 ) ρ ) ] n average size center study , estimated 3000 patient per year , ρ intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . With hypothetical ICC 0.01 , number subject require estimated 7500 patient . The number center set 10 average inclusion 3,000 woman per year , investigator easily reach number woman require . Statistical Analysis 1 . Descriptive analysis Data express mean ( SD ) , median 1st , 3rd quartile , appropriate quantitative variable . Qualitative variable express total number percentage Comparison characteristic group perform use χ2 test Fisher exact test qualitative variable . For quantitative variable , comparison involve t.test wilcoxon test . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant 2 . Statistical analysis Two analysis perform : First analysis : compare incidence event take account Indicator mother newborn health 'Early result group ' 'delayed start group ' 'at end period 2 ( see figure 2 ) . Second analysis : ass difference event rate 'Early result group ' 'delayed start group ' duration study ( Period period2 + 3 ) . This analysis show whether benefit observe 'Early result group ' observed end two continue end study two group receive intervention . The investigator use hierarchical model account possible correlation observation maternity ward . The investigator introduce variable dependent maternity ( level , status , number medical staff , activity ... ) woman ( newborn ) . All test perform use SAS software version 9.2 ML-Win 3 . CUmulative SUM ( CUSUM ) Chart CUSUM chart construct calculate plot sum St = max ( 0 , St-1 + Xt - k+ ) , S0=0 , detect upward change ; St = min ( 0 , St-1 + Xt - k- ) , S0=0 , detect downward change . The CUSUM test null hypothesis , accord process 'in control ' ( IC ) , , performance acceptable ; oppose 'out control ' ( OC ) .</detailed_description>
