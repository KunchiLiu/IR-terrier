	<brief_summary>In study investigator propose treat patient steroid-refractory Graft-versus-host Disease ( GVHD ) manner design promote CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs . The profound immune suppression follow common salvage treatment GVHD unfortunately lead poor outcomes high infection rate . A targeted approach base promotion stabilization Tregs hop allow GVHD control without profound immunosuppression usually see . High-dose cyclophosphamide sirolimus successfully use prevention GVHD show enhance Tregs subpopulation . The addition low dose IL-2 demethylating agent azacitidine also study attempt promote stabilize FoxP3 expression Tregs .</brief_summary>
