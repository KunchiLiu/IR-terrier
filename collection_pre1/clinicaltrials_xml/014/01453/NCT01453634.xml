	<brief_title>Four Week , Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic , Efficacy , Safety Study Lunacalcipol ( CTA018 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , PD , safety , PK efficacy study Lunacalcipol Injection . Approximately 12 subject randomize 1 2 treatment group receive either 180 µg ( n=4 ) 270 µg ( n=8 ) Lunacalcipol Injection 1:2 ratio , respectively . All subject plan receive total 11 dos study drug give three time per week ( tiw ) 24 day ( day 1 day 24 ) , administer often every day . Previously define criterion relate serum level iPTH , Ca , P review Medical Monitor determine subject safety . If criterion observe , subject discontinue study , receive administration study drug follow safety . Safety data review Medical Monitor first 2 subject 270 µg group . If first 2 subject meet dose group discontinuation criterion , include treatment emergent calciphylaxis , treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAEs ) relate elevated serum Ca level , report death associate elevate serum Ca level relate study drug , subject beyond first 2 dose . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) appoint provide independent evaluation safety data , include laboratory result serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . The DSMB conduct review 4 subject 270 µg dose group complete least 6 dos , time death report , request DSMB . The DSMB also conduct additional review End Study .</detailed_description>
