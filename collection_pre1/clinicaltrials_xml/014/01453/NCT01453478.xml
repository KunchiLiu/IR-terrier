	<brief_summary>This Phase I study assess combine effect food suppression gastric acid secretion relative bioavailability immediate release ( IR ) tablet formulation prototype bioenhanced formulation GSK1325756 , oral interleukin 8 receptor ( IL8R also know CXCR2 ) antagonist . The objective understand co-administration food enhances absorption inter-subject variability current GSK1325756 IR tablet fed state proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) condition secondly ass whether two propose bioenhanced formulation offer improvement current GSK1325756 IR formulation PPI condition . This open-label , randomize , 5-period crossover study complete single cohort subject , interim analysis completion Treatment Period 4 . During Treatment Periods 1 4 , subject randomize receive GSK1325756 50 mg IR fed state , GSK1325756 50 mg IR fast state , GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 1 fast state , GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 2 fast state . Progression Treatment Period 5 choice bioenhanced formulation dose treatment period dependent finding interim analysis pharmacokinetic profile relative bioavailability formulation follow completion Treatment Periods 1 4 . In Treatment Period 5 , subject receive select GSK1325756 bioenhanced formulation fed state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate relative bioavailability , include inter-subject variability , immediate release ( IR ) tablet use previous Phase I study 2 prototype bioenhanced tablet formulation GSK1325756 healthy elderly male female subject feed fasted state suppression gastric acid secretion ( concomitant omeprazole , 20 mg , daily ( QD ) ) . Secondary objective include provision information oral pharmacokinetic ( PK ) GSK1325756 elderly different dose condition suppression gastric acid secretion , additional safety tolerability information oral administration GSK1325756 elderly subject . The current study provide understand PK three formulation GSK1325756 gastric acid suppression population 65 80 year old healthy adult subject . The effect food PK GSK1325756 formulation also address population . The outcome study likely guide selection appropriate formulation/dosing regimen future study . The complete clinical study demonstrate minimize inter-subject variability exposure GSK1325756 , current formulation need administer food , particularly elderly subject . This preclude development current formulation , ideal , particularly twice daily administration need chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient elderly subject food intake variable . In addition , inter-subject variability exposure current formulation give omeprazole fasted state acceptable . This likely due need low pH ( acid level ) ( pH &lt; 2 ) gastric environment , particularly fast state , allow sufficient solubilization GSK1325756 prior transport small intestine absorb . Thus , study conduct follow reason : ( 1 ) determine current formulation result acceptable exposure inter-subject variability give food subject gastric acid secretion suppress omeprazole ( 2 ) determine bio-enhanced formulation provide acceptable exposure profile acceptable inter-subject variability fast state subject gastric acid suppress . This information important help determine appropriate formulation dose regimen progression study COPD patient .</detailed_description>
