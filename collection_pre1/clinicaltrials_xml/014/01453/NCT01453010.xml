	<brief_summary>Arm hand weakness result stroke occurs approximately 70 % stroke survivor cause huge loss function independence . A wide range treatment approach develop improve motor recovery . Despite treatment , Constraint Induced Movement Therapy , show promise , large focus high-intensity repetitive task-specific practice . Patients little hand finger movement however may able participate actively task specific training . The SaeboFlex dynamic orthosis , spring-loaded feature facilitate open finger hand . This allow patient grasp release object repeatedly , hence enable participation repetitive task practice increase potential motor recovery . Despite SaeboFlex use successfully several center country internationally , research provide evidence effectiveness scarce . As consequence funding SaeboFlex limit usually require patient ' fund . The study aim explore potential benefit feasibility participate Self-directed SaeboFlex training program allow repetitive task practice patient early stroke . Subjects undergo 12-week training program comprise maximum 3 x 45 minute session day . Activities focus grasp release ball reach target , wear SaeboFlex majority session . At end session SaeboFlex remove hand incorporate functional task able . Subjects set individualized training program Saebo-trained therapist . The program grade progressed rate appropriate individual . The study measure follow-up 8 subject explore improvement recovery functional ability upper limb affect dependency level . It also explore level intensity patient early stroke tolerate participate self-directed therapy . All patient meet inclusion criterion motivate undergo specific SaeboFlex self-directed training program . Subjects record time intensity training session also routine upper limb therapy . Patients assess , 3 month train . If case show promise study support need large trial include clinical efficacy dose finding study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Subjects : Be either inpatient Colchester Stroke Unit , Outpatients follow acute stroke admission Colchester Stroke Unit Be adult suffer stroke 3 84 day recruitment Have anterior circulation stroke i.e . must weakness ataxia Have substantially paretic hand finger meet criterion SaeboFlex orthosis Have previously fully functional upper limb ( i.e . previous weakness , severe movement disorder , severe Rheumatoid Arthritis ) Be able participate self direct therapy ( i.e . severe visual cognitive deficit preclude participation task repetitive practice record train time ) Are medically fit participate repetitive task practice determine consultant ( GP outpatient ) . Saebo Flex requirement ( inclusion criterion ) Subjects must : A minimum 15 degree passive wrist extension ( finger must extend ) At least 15 degree active shoulder motion plane At least 15 degree elbow flexion At least Â¼ range active finger flexion ( IP ) flexion Exclusion criterion : Patients able open close his/her hand completely , 10 time keep wrist neutral maintain / maximum shoulder flexion good Saeboflex . Other treatment option consider . Severe joint deformity could worsen use orthosis , i.e . RA Those patient extremely poor skin integrity may cause irritation skin damage . We exclude stroke survivor basis age gender subject need motivate selfdirected study .</criteria>
