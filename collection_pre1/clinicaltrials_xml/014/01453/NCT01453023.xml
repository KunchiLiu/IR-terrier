	<brief_title>Inhaled Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Safety Tolerability , PK PD Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate safety tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ( FF/VI ) 100/25mcg administer use novel dry powder inhaler child age 5 11 year persistent asthma . Fluticasone furoate ( FF , GW685698 ) novel daily inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) vilanterol ( VI , GW642444 ) inhale daily long-acting beta2 agonist ( LABA ) . FF/VI novel ICS/LABA combination once-daily dose develop treatment asthma adult , adolescent , child 5 year . This study randomize , double-blind , repeat dose , two period crossover study , FF control . During two treatment period subject receive either FF/VI 100/25 microgram ( mcg ) FF 100 mcg daily 14 consecutive morning via novel dry powder inhaler . Approximately 26 subject recruit study , target 20 complete subject . Safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics glucose , potassium cortisol level investigate .</detailed_description>
