	<brief_summary>The intent clinical study answer question : 1 . Is propose treatment safe 2 . Is treatment effective improve disease pathology patient Renal Failure clinical outcome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Effects Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Delivered Patients With Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells ( ASCs ) novel therapy patient suffer Renal failure . By inject ASCs , region may become populated ASCs , thereby potentially restore kidney function . ASCs patient-derived ( `` autologous '' ) cell transplantation technology deliver patient . The therapy compose cell derive patient ' adipose tissue isolate within approximately 1 hour immediately deliver back patient .</detailed_description>
