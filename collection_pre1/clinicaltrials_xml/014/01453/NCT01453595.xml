	<brief_summary>This study test new medication treatment kidney cancer , call BEZ235 . This medication work block several mechanism cancer need grow survive . By block mechanism , medication thus suppress growth cancer , possibly kill cancer cell . Older kidney cancer medication ( temsirolimus [ Torisel® ] everolimus [ Afinitor® ] ) typically block one mechanism cancer cell , investigator think BEZ235 may work even good kidney cancer . The purpose first part study test safety give BEZ235 different dos . The investigator try find safe dose BEZ235 want find effect , good and/or bad , patient cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced renal cell carcinoma . Advanced disease define unresectable , locally recurrent disease metastatic disease . This must confirm MSKCC pathology review follow requirement : Phase 1b : Any histologic subtype RCC . Phase 2 : clear cell type RCC predominant clear cell component . Patients screen prior systemic therapy : Phase 1b : Any prior therapy . Phase 2 : Progression disease least one prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus , temsirolimus , ridaforolimus ) . Other prior systemic therapy include VEGF direct therapy ( e.g . sunitinib , sorafenib , bevacizumab ) immunotherapy ( e.g . IL2 , interferonα ) also permit . Evidence unidimensionally measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer , Therasse et al . 2009 ) . Resolution acute toxic effect prior systemic treatment , radiotherapy surgical procedure NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 , decline last 2 week . 18 year age old . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,000/μL Platelets ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Serum calcium ≤12.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; exceed , estimate creatinine clearance must ≥ 30 ml/min Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( patient know Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN , direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ) Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN set hepatic metastasis ) INR ≤ 2 . ( Anticoagulation warfarin contraindicate ) Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) ≤ 140mg/dL HgbA1c ≤ 8 % Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL , fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Signed date informed consent document indicate subject ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior undergo study screening procedure . Subject 's willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients receive prior treatment P13K inhibitor ( Phase 2 portion ) . Patients within 28 day post major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) significant traumatic injury . Patients radiation therapy within 28 day prior start study treatment ( palliative radiotherapy bone lesion allow complete 2 week prior study treatment start ) . Patients receive chemotherapy , immunotherapy investigational agent ≤ 2 week prior study treatment start . Patients currently receive medication know inducer moderate / strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ( see table 9.2 list ) Patients must discontinue medication ≥ 7 day prior initiation study treatment . Patients currently receive medication significant risk induce Torsades de Pointes Patients currently receive treatment warfarin sodium ( Coumadin® ) . If treatment discontinue switched alternate anticoagulant prior enrollment , INR within ≤48h prior study initiation return ≤ 2 x ULN . Patients receive chronic treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) Patients evidence history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases spinal cord compression , unless prior treatment surgery radiotherapy AND progression CNS disease within 6 month prior enrollment . Patients must receive chronic corticosteroid therapy CNS metastasis . Patients history severe medical condition condition could affect participation study : symptomatic intrinsic lung disease require oxygen supplementation baseline uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e. , SBP &gt; 180 mmHg DBP &gt; 100mmHg ) active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled infection/disorders impair ability evaluate patient patient complete study liver disease cirrhosis decompensated liver disease . Impairment gastrointestinal function may impair absorption BEZ235 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea/vomiting ; diarrhea ≥ grade 2 ; malabsorption syndromes prior smallbowel resection ) Immunocompromised patient and/or history HIV seropositivity Patients prior current cardiac problem include : History unstable angina pectoris ( time ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA III , IV ) ( time ) , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ( time ) , myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident ≤ 6 month prior first study treatment history leave ventricular dysfunction reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % screen echocardiogram multiple gate acquisition ( MUGA ) scan severe valvulopathies document compromise cardiac function Any follow screen ECG : QTc interval &gt; 480 msec ( family history congenital QTc prolongation ) Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Complete leave bundle branch block Any conduction abnormality require pacemaker Symptomatic sinus bradycardia Any ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication Symptomatic pericarditis Documented cardiomyopathy cause Female patient pregnant breast feeding ; pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive serum βhCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Patients unwilling unable comply adequate double barrier contraception throughout trial 12 week last dose study drug ( male female patient ) . This include following consideration : Hormonal contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider neither indicated effective . Adequate barrier method contraception include : diaphragm , condom ( partner ) , intrauterine device ( copper ) , sponge spermicide . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL [ US : estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL ] surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential Patients history another primary malignancy treatment ≤ 3 year , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ uterine cervix . Patients receive attenuated live vaccine within one week study entry . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Known intolerance study drug ( excipients ) , and/or know hypersensitivity PI3K inhibitor ( eg . GDC0980 ) , and/or know hypersensitivity rapamycins ( eg . Sirolimus , everolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients .</criteria>
