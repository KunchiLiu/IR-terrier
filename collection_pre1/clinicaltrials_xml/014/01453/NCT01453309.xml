	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Cell Savers use intraoperatively decrease risk transfusion due surgical blood loss . Blood collect operative field anticoagulated , filter , store reservoir . Once set volume blood collect reservoir , blood separate red blood cell plasma component use centrifuge . Red blood cell wash crystalloid solution reinfused patient . Although theoretical benefit use cell saver attractive , literature seem controversial respect efficacy cost-effectiveness . The benefit clear patient undergoing fusion scoliosis involve 5 level blood loss consider substantial . It less clear patient undergo limit two three level lumbar fusion . The purpose study determine cost-effectiveness use cell saver 2 3 level lumbar fusion . A secondary objective determine decrease number allogenic blood transfusion cell saver use intraoperatively . Another secondary objective determine incidence complication associate cell saver use transfusion . METHODS Patients see Norton Leatherman Spine Center schedule decompression fusion 2 3 lumbar spine segment screen study . After obtain informed consent , patient randomize cell saver use intraoperatively ( Cell Saver group ) cell saver ( Non-Cell Saver group ) . Data collect include age , gender , smoke status , height , weight , co-morbidities , use medication may increase bleeding ( Plavix , Coumadin , Warfarin ) , increase blood production ( Ferrous sulfate , erythropoietin ) medication use decrease intraoperative bleeding ( Aprotinin , Tranexamic Acid ) ; use hypotensive anesthesia , ASA Grade , indication surgery , date surgery , estimate blood loss , surgical approach , surgical level , bone graft use , operative time , complication , length stay , discharge information , whether patient pre-donated blood , hemoglobin , hematocrit maximum body temperature prior surgery patient 's hospital stay , surgical drain output , product transfuse intraoperatively postoperatively amount cell saver salvage , re-infused , cell-saver hematocrit hemoglobin prior re-infusion . The cost associate use cell-saver and/or blood transfusion , include supply personnel time , determine . Randomization Randomization stratify block randomization allow stratification number level fuse . Randomization use seal envelope . Sample Size To detect medium effect size 0.3 α error 0.05 , total 220 subject need include analysis . To account subject withdrawal , total 240 subject enrolled Procedures Patients receive care Norton Leatherman Spine Center screen potential subject study . Only exist information obtain per standard routine medical procedure use . Patients fail pre-screening record log form . Patients consider potential candidate study base screen sign Institutional Review Board -approved Informed Consent Document HIPAA Authorization form prior participate study activity . Subjects randomize receive receive cell saver surgery . The following data collect clinic visit : age , gender , smoke status , height , weight , co-morbidities , use medication may increase bleeding ( Plavix , Coumadin , Warfarin ) , increase blood production ( Ferrous sulfate , erythropoietin ) . The following pre-operative data collect : hemoglobin , hematocrit , body temperature whether patient pre-donated blood , predonated blood volume date donation . Surgery perform per standard care treat surgeon . The choice surgical approach , instrumentation bone grafts/bone graft substitute discretion surgeon . The following intraoperative data collect : use hypotensive anesthesia , ASA Grade , indication surgery , date surgery , estimate blood loss , surgical approach , surgical level , bone graft use , operative time product transfuse intraoperatively . In subject randomize Cell Saver group , amount cell saver salvage , re-infused , cell-saver hematocrit hemoglobin prior re-infusion determine collect . In-hospital post-operative data collect include : complication , length stay , discharge information , hematocrit , hemoglobin maximum body temperature patient 's hospital stay , surgical drain output , product transfuse postoperatively . Subjects transfuse set transfusion threshold hemoglobin 7.0g/dL correspond hematocrit 21 . Subjects Hb 7.0g/dL symptomatic evidence tachycardia , hypotension , orthostatic hypotension pre-existing cardiac pulmonary disease also transfuse . The risk occur study associate general risk spine surgery . Risks associate allogeneic blood transfusion include allergic reaction , hemolytic reaction , isoimmunization , graft versus host reaction , increased infection rate , transmission bloodborne pathogen , include human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis . Risks associate use cell saver include paradoxical increase blood loss , electrolyte depletion , metabolic acidosis , hematuria Endpoints The primary endpoint volume blood transfusion require . Secondary endpoint include - Immediate post-op Hematocrit level - Immediate post-op Hemoglobin level - Volume blood product use post-operatively Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistic , include frequency count discrete variable measure central tendency ( mean , median ) dispersion ( standard deviation , range ) continuous variable calculate . Comparisons Cell Saver non-Cell Saver group do independent test continuous variable χ2 test discrete variable . To determine effect potentially confound variable , analysis covariance compare Cell Saver non-Cell Saver group use . This help identify variable may statistically different Cell Saver non-Cell Saver group could potentially influence total unit blood transfuse . Those variable significantly relate ( i.e. , correlate ) number unit blood transfused entered covariates statistical model determine affect statistical conclusion Cell Saver non-Cell Saver group . All analysis perform priori alpha level 0.05 use IBM SPSS version 19.0 . Funding This study unfunded .</detailed_description>
