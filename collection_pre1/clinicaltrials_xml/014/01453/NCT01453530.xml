	<detailed_description>The number ambulatory surgical procedure increase rapidly . Surgery without one overnight stay hospital appreciate patient considerable economic efficiency advantage . It facilitate new anesthetic analgesic drug rapid onset shorter reliable duration action . Paramount successful ambulatory surgery timely discharge patient time discharge fit go home . Early discharge Release patient , later experience postoperative complication require unanticipated hospital re-admission , occur . Fatigue , nausea , vomit pain delay patient 's discharge.2 Patients psychomotor impairment may prone accident travel home.3 Short stay acceptable practice patient return home safely comfortably minimal side effect anesthesia surgery . Stages recovery Recovery outpatient anesthesia include dissipation anesthetic agent , normalization physiological function , observation medical surgical complication , treatment immediate side effect anesthesia surgery , ultimately , discharge return home.4 Recovery anesthesia may divide three main stage . Early recovery Awakening recovery vital reflex . Intermediate recovery Intermediate clinical recovery , home readiness . Late recovery Full recovery . Psychological recovery . Home readiness street fitness Intermediate recovery implies patient ready go home ( accompany care taker ) . Street fitness mean patient ready go home , also capable safely take part traffic.6 Part full recovery cognitive function . Tests Scoring system develop guide transfer hospital recovery room ward may use assess early recovery ambulatory surgical patient . The commonly use method , describe Aldrete Kroulik provide objective information physical condition patient arrive recovery room anesthesia.7 This test modify 1995 assigns score 0 , 1 2 activity , respiration , circulation , consciousness oxygenation . A score 9 10 indicates adequacy early recovery enable discharge post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .8 Intermediate recovery home readiness determine early recovery tests.9 Chung suggest post-anesthetic discharge score system ( PADSS ) , may provide reliable measure anesthetic recovery.10 PADSS base vital sign , ambulation mental status , pain , nausea vomiting , surgical bleeding fluid intake output . The qualification discharge include postoperative discharge score 9 presence competent adult accompany patient home . Assessment late recovery ( e.g . patient ready drive car resume normal daily activity ) require sophisticated laboratory test use normal clinical practice.11 Many test apply assess recovery . The Human Performance Measurement/Basic Elements Performance ( HPM/BEP ) system® ( Human Performance Measurement , Inc , Arlington , TX , USA ) collect motor performance data . The HPM module hand ( BEP 1 ) use e.g . Haavisto.12 BEP 1 multifunction system design measure different aspect upper extremity , include visual spatial memory capacity , simple reaction time , choice reaction time , movement speed , wrist tap co-ordination . The test-retest reliability HPM/BEP test describe detail Kauranen , reliability system acceptable.13 The BEP1 module include visual spatial memory capacity , simple reaction time , one-choice reaction time 1 speed movement , two-choice reaction time 1 speed movement , index finger-tapping speed , co-ordination test , digit-symbol substitution Maddox Wing test . Neuromuscular block agent Neuromuscular block agent ( NMBAs ) commonly use surgery facilitate endotracheal intubation , allow assist controlled ventilation , let surgery proceed easily . Although neuromuscular function recover spontaneously , recovery frequently partial . However , rapid complete reversal neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) desirable surgical setting avoid residual paralysis related adverse outcome , amongst impaired motor behaviour . Reversal NMB Traditionally , reversal NMB accomplish cholinesterase inhibitor ( e.g . neostigmine , pyridostigmine , edrophonium ) act inhibit breakdown ACh neuromuscular junction.14 Although effective recovery already take place , cholinesterase inhibitor associate number limitation , include induction cholinergic adverse event ( e.g . bradycardia , bronchospasm , bronchial secretion , abdominal cramping ) incomplete reversal NMB certain circumstances.15 , 16 Sugammadex Sugammadex ( Bridion® ) novel approach rapid reversal steroid base NMBA's.17 , 18 The drug develop The Netherlands Organon , part Schering-Plough , part Merck . The drug modify gamma-cyclodextrin water soluble lipophilic cavity trap NMBA . The formation sugammadex/NMBA complex result reduction amount free circulating NMBA , leave receptor available bind Ach.19 Sugammadex act selectively steroidal NMBAs rocuronium vecuronium little activity nonsteroidal NMBAs ( eg , succinylcholine , atracurium , cisatracurium ) . There evidence sugammadex metabolize ; drug primarily eliminate via renal route unchanged drug . The drug Europe approve routine clinical use reverse neuromuscular blockade induce steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxant . In surgical patient , sugammadex produce dose-dependent reversal NMB induce rocuronium vecuronium.20-22 In comparative study , sugammadex demonstrate effectiveness superior cholinesterase inhibitor NMB reversal several time point administration rocuronium vecuronium . This include routine reversal deep moderate NMB immediate reversal NMB.23-25 For example , routine reversal deep NMB , sugammadex associate 15-fold shorter median time recovery T4/T1 ratio 0.9 compare neostigmine sevoflurane anesthesia . Sugammadex well tolerate significant cardiovascular hemodynamic adverse events.26 Dysgeusia ( metallic bitter taste ) common adverse event , primarily see dos ≥32 mg/kg ; report dysgeusia surgical patient receive drug . Age , gender , race , ethnicity appear influence safety sugammadex.27 Rationale study Sugammadex register The Netherlands since October 2008 . Several anesthesiologist world , independently report patient seem alert early phase recovery reversal NMB sugammadex compare reversal cholinesterase inhibitor spontaneous recovery . However , observation substantiate clinical study . It proven TOF ratio 0,9 , i.e . clinical muscle relaxation nearly disappear patient safely extubated , 70-80 % nicotine receptor still block NMBA . An explanation possible increase alertness reversal sugammadex could sugammadex efficiently quickly reverse rest blockade , result quick return alertness cognitive function due arousal incoming signal γ-motor system . Because sugammadex inert , less likely unknown pharmacological effect sugammadex , cyclodextrin , responsible suppose effect . Increased alertness immediately anesthesia positive effect patient safety wellbeing would enable early discharge PACU . Earlier discharge contributes efficient use PACU general might allow early hospital discharge patient surgery daycare set , meet street fitness criterion sooner . This pilot study design ass whether sugammadex indeed , compare neostigmine placebo , positive effect street fitness patient assess nature , magnitude time onset effect ( ) . 30 patient randomize three group 10 patient ( sugammadex , neostigmine/glycopyrrolate reversal ) . These number base practical consideration , data available base sample size calculation . The data study enable sample size calculation formal well-powered efficacy study . If suppose effect alertness demonstrate , may worthwhile investigate mechanism action well . The investigator choose trial design sugammadex use reverse neuromuscular blockade induce rocuronium . Sugammadex first , neostigmine/glycopyrrolate second , placebo third study arm , administer post surgery clinical neuromuscular function recover level TOF ratio ~ 0,9 ( i.e . 70-80 % receptor still occupy ) . It suppose sugammadex efficiently quickly reverse `` subclinical '' rest blockade , lead increased alertness . Since high alertness never describe traditional drug neostigmine placebo expect effect . The post surgery cognitive evaluation perform 30 minute TOF ratio reach . This first 30 minute time point consider clinically relevant . In case effect demonstrate later , relevance becomes questionable . TOF measure reach approximately 0.9 , thereafter cognitive function evaluate . A limited number commonly use cognitive test select assess recovery psychomotor function , include Modified Aldrete Score , trail making test , Maddox wing test visual analogue scale . With test positive effect sugammadex recovery alertness demonstrable .</detailed_description>
