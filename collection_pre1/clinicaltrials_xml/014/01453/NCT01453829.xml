	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Effects Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Patients After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells ( ASCs ) novel therapy patient suffer stroke . By inject ASCs either internal carotid artery , region may become populated ASCs , thereby potentially restore brain function . ASCs patient-derived ( `` autologous '' ) cell transplantation technology deliver patient internal carotid artery intravenously . The therapy compose cell derive patient ' adipose tissue isolate within approximately 1 hour immediately deliver back patient .</detailed_description>
