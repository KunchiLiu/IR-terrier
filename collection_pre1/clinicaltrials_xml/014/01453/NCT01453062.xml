	<brief_summary>B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) subtype mature peripheral B-cell neoplasm , characterize accumulation circulate malignant lymphocyte typically express cell surface marker CD5 , CD20 , CD23 . It common type leukemia adult Western Europe US . The median age diagnosis 65-70 year , male female ratio 2:1 . Initially , patient present asymptomatic lymphocytosis need cytoreductive therapy . Patients active disease characterize lymphocyte double time le 6 month , progressive , even massive lymphadenopathy , hepatosplenomegaly , anemia thrombocytopenia . Constitutional symptom fever , night sweat , unintended weight loss , extreme fatigue common advance disease significantly impact quality life . CLL also cause relative immunosuppression increase risk infection ultimately major cause death patient population . Median survival diagnosis range 5 20+ year depend risk factor , 6 14 month patient CLL refractory available therapy . Arzerra ( ofatumumab ) human monoclonal antibody ( IgG1 ) bind specifically distinct epitope encompass small large extracellular loop CD20 molecule . The CD20 molecule transmembrane phosphoprotein express B lymphocytes pre-B mature B lymphocyte stage B-cell tumor . Arzerra designate orphan medicinal product European Union ( EU ) treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The Committee Orphan Medicinal Products ( COMP ) conclude chronic lymphocytic leukemia estimate affect approximately 3.5 10,000 person Community time application make ( June 2008 ) condition chronically debilitate life-threatening , particular due poor long-term survival high-risk patient . Arzerra give conditional approval EU April 19 , 2010 . The approved indication EU product treatment CLL patient refractory fludarabine alemtuzumab . A specific obligation conditional approval agreement GSK conduct post-marketing observational study CLL patient receive Arzerra . The data study intend enhance evidence safety efficacy Arzerra use clinical practice , final data available , together result second specific obligation study , support transition conditional full approval Arzerra EU . The objective observational study provide additional data confirm safety profile efficacy Arzerra CLL patient treat clinical practice . Particular data interest : co-morbidities ( specific chronic disease diagnosis ) , concomitant medication , disease ( CLL ) characteristic , prior treatment regimen , adverse event , reason discontinuation Arzerra therapy , Arzerra response , progression free survival , overall survival . This observational , non-interventional , medical record review study CLL patient . A total 100 patient CLL previously receive Arzerra , whether alive decease , either complete full course Arzerra therapy discontinue treatment early eligible participate study . Centers across Europe member non member European Research Initiative CLL ( ERIC ) treat CLL patient participate study . CLL patient newly initiate Arzerra still undergo treatment phase patient treat Arzerra phase II phase III clinical trial exclude . For patient complete approximately 1 year follow since Arzerra initiation , data response Arzerra , adverse event treatment subsequent treatment , patient status , progression free survival overall survival cover period approximately one-year post-drug initiation collect . For patient complete approximately l year follow-up since Arzerra initiation , include lose follow die prior one year yet full year elapse calendar time , similar data collect point time last available patient contact physician use information record . After approach inform consent patient next kin patient die review medical record , interaction patient occur .</brief_summary>
