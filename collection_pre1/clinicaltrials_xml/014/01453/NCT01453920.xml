	<brief_summary>The current norm clinical practice treatment choroidal neovascular membrane ( CNVM ) secondary Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) involve monthly injection Ranibizumab disease stabilize . At point , physician tend follow one two treatment regimen . 'Treat -and-observe ' entail regular follow-up stable patient , treatment thereafter presence disease recurrence . Alternatively , 'treat-and-extend ' dosing strategy , interval treatment extend long disease remain stable . Many clinician , employ treat-and-extend dose regimen , extend treatment interval beyond 3 month . However , possible subgroup patient every three month 'treat-and-extend ' dosing may represent uniquely , stable population would perform particularly well observational regimen regular follow-up . We hypothesize low CNVM recurrence rate wet AMD patient stable every three month Ranibizumab dose ( 'treat-and-extend ' ) , begin treat-and-observe protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In North America , AMD lead cause irreversible vision loss 65 year age.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) potent promoter angiogenesis vascular permeability role pathogenesis neovascular AMD well recognized.2,3 The advent VEGF inhibitor Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ; Genentech Inc. ) revolutionize management neovascular AMD . Ranibizumab intravitreally administer recombinant , humanize , monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment ( Fab ) neutralize know active form VEGF-A . In landmark phase III clinical study MARINA , ANCHOR , Ranibizumab injection administer monthly course 2 year eyes subfoveal CNVMs secondary AMD . Ranibizumab show prevent loss visual acuity ( VA ) also improve VA average patient . 4-6 Despite tremendous benefit treatment , prospect indefinitely adhere monthly treatment schedule MARINA ANCHOR raise ocular systemic safety concern well convenience cost issue patient physician alike . The identification alternative dosing strategy capable reduce number require anti-VEGF injection still achieve favourable visual acuity outcome since subject great interest . The current norm clinical practice Ranibizumab implement 'initiation phase ' follow individualized 'maintenance phase ' model one two basic approach : 'treat-and-observe ' 'treat-and-extend ' . Both regimen currently consider within standard clinical practice . 'Treat -and-observe ' entail treatment follow-up macula free exudation , treatment thereafter presence recurrent exudation.7 Alternatively , treat-and-extend dosing strategy , interval treatment extend long macula remain dry.8 In 2009 ASRS survey , 56 % physician report employ treat-and-observe 44 % report employing treat-and-extend patient neovascular AMD.9 In study Oubraham et al10 find treat-and-extend dose regimen may yield great gain vision treat-and-observe , albeit great number require injection . In treat-and-extend dosing strategy , patient may require frequent monthly injection stabilize disease , others may demonstrate stable condition require infrequent treatment . Many clinician employ treat-and-extend dose regimen , extend treatment interval beyond 3 month . However , possible subgroup patient every three month 'treat-and-extend ' dosing may represent unique , stable population would perform particularly well 'treat-and-observe ' regimen .</detailed_description>
