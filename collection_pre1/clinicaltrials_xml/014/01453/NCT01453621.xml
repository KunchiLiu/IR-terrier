	<brief_summary>Blunt head trauma ( BHT ) account &gt; 450,000 emergency department ( ED ) visit child annually US . Fortunately , &gt; 95 % head trauma child minor nature . Although child minor head trauma , clinician obtain cranial CTs 35-50 % child , carry radiation risk malignancy . Recently , investigator conduct study 44,000 child Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network ( PECARN ) investigator develop validated clinical prediction rule identify child minor BHT low risk clinically-important traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , therefore , require CT scan . In proposal , investigator aim ass whether implement PECARN TBI prediction rule ( one preverbal , one verbal child ) via computerized clinical decision support ( CDS ) decrease number ( unnecessary ) cranial CT scan obtain ED physician child minor BHT low risk clinically-important TBIs . After two-site pilot phase test refine CDS , investigator conduct seven-center prospective trial . The investigator measure cranial CT use prior intervention implementation CDS clinician education . The investigator study use CT practitioner child &lt; 18 year 12 month pre- post-intervention .</brief_summary>
