	<brief_summary>Phase 1B : Open label ( patient receive PEGPH20+gemcitabine ) , dose escalation , safety tolerability study determine safe dose PEGPH20 use combination gemcitabine Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic cancer patient . Phase 2 : Randomized , double blind study compare effect overall survival gemcitabine plus PEGPH20 vs gemcitabine plus placebo Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PEGPH20 PEGylated version human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase , preclinical study , show remove HA extracellular matrix surround tumor cell depolymerizing substrate . 87 % pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) overexpress HA . PDA tumor tissue may especially sensitive HA-degradation property PEGPH20 thus responsive cytotoxic effect give dose gemcitabine . Modifying extracellular environment increase penetration efficacy anti-cancer agent represent novel approach treat pancreatic cancer may provide important therapeutic outcome patient Stage IV Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer . This Phase 1B/2 study ass safety , tolerability , treatment effect , various PK/PD endpoint .</detailed_description>
