The investigator study provide critical information provider policymakers consider optimal strategy increase CRC screen among vulnerable population . Overall Study Goal : Improve colorectal cancer screen increase rate repeat fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) . Aim 1 : Test multifaceted intervention increase repeat FOBT test adherence 30-month period Hypothesis 1 : Compared usual care , intervention increase proportion patient complete repeat annual FOBT within 6 month due date . Hypothesis 2 : Compared usual care , intervention increase proportion patient complete 2 additional FOBTs 30-month intervention period . Aim 2 : Explore perceive barrier screen among patient receive intervention complete repeat FOBT test within 18 month Aim 3 : Assess cost intervention cost per additional repeat screening compare patient receive usual care .</brief_summary>
