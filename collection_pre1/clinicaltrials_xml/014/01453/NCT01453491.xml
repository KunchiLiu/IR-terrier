	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : - 1 ) Test safety tolerability 2 different oral dos SRT2104 subject ulcerative colitis - 2 ) Determine amount SRT2104 measure single blood sample addition colon and/or rectal tissue sample ( biopsy ) - 3 ) Determine whether SRT2104 anti-inflammatory effect colon and/or rectum take orally 8 week - 4 ) Determine whether SRT2104 cause detectable change specific biomarkers . A biomarker biological marker ( substance protein ) use indicator change biological state corresponds risk progression disease .</brief_summary>
