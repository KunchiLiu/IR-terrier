	<brief_summary>The investigator propose use DaTscan patient REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , neurodegenerative syndrome disorder , test several hypothesis - confirmatory , novel . Such use provide new data potential clinical research utility DaTscan neurodegenerative disease . The finding DaTscan correlate clinical diagnosis multimodal image study ( e.g. , MRI , MRS , FDG-PET , amyloid-PET ) enhance understand neurodegenerative disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lewy body disease ( LBD ) one common neurodegenerative disease second Alzheimer 's disease term prevalence , disability , societal/financial burden . The phenotypic variability LBD striking , manifest well-known disorder Parkinson 's disease without ( PD ) dementia ( PDD ) , well DLB , MCI , REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) , syndromes . One biomarker highly sensitive specific evolve LBD set dementia DaTscan [ Ioflupane ( 123I ) ] imaging , loss functional dopaminergic neuron terminal striatum assessed DaTscan reflect underlying LBD dementia particularly dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) . DaTscan one first radiopharmaceutical agent available detect DaT distribution within brain . DaTscan image involves injection Ioflupane radioligand follow image use standard single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) scanner . DaTscan provide visualization dopamine transporter ( DaT ) distribution within striata ( i.e. , striatal uptake , striatal signal ) SPECT image patient present symptom sign suggestive dopaminergic neurodegeneration . Most DaTscan study publish date conduct center outside US . DaTscan study syndrome MCI , minimally corticobasal degeneration ( CBD ) . Very little normative data exists age population either . The FDA-approved indication assist evaluation adult patient suspect Parkinsonian syndrome ( PS ) . In patient , DaTscan may use help differentiate essential tremor tremor due Parkinsonian syndrome ( idiopathic Parkinson 's disease , multiple system atrophy progressive supranuclear palsy ) . DaTscan use adjunct diagnostic evaluation . Identifying dopaminergic dysfunction also important setting cognitive impairment without parkinsonism , subject REM sleep behavior disorder . The finding DaTscan subject various disorder correlate clinical diagnosis multimodal image study ( e.g. , MRI , MRS , FDG-PET , amyloid-PET ) enhance understand neurodegenerative disease . A subset subject undergo 2nd DaTscan least 1 year initial scan perform determine change time provide prognostic information .</detailed_description>
