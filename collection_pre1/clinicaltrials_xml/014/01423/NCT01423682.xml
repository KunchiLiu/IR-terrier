	<brief_summary>Patients rotator cuff tendinopathy make large part population physiotherapy practice . The rotator cuff , shoulder muscle group , play important role cause pain . Tendons suffer large compression friction , lead degeneration tendon . Rehabilitation often lead unsatisfying result . In Achilles patella tendinopathy , new train program call eccentric training show good result . Eccentric training contains exercise force resist muscle lengthens instead shortens . This would large influence tendon tissue . Some small study also show promising result eccentric train patient rotator cuff tendinopathy mechanism behind result remain unclear . To investigate , 30 patient rotator cuff tendinopathy 30 healthy subject evaluate immediately perform exercise . Three measurement do : ultrasonographic measurement tendon thickness , power Doppler imaging measurement microcirculation around tendon Oxygen see . All measurement non-invasive , pain free without risk human body .</brief_summary>
