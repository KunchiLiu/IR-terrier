	<brief_summary>Purpose Psychotic disorder ( include schizophrenia ) complex neurobehaviour disorder influence genetic , neurodevelopmental , neurochemical , well psychosocial factor . Despite significant progress pharmacotherapy , disorder often result long-term disability ( rank globally amongst top ten leading cause disability-adjusted life year , DALYS ) , often associate extensive cost , burden , morbidity mortality . Objective / hypothesis The study aim ( 1 ) measure prevalence psychotic symptom Hong Kong population ; ( 2 ) explore associate risk protective factor expression psychotic symptom ; ( 3 ) characterize functional disability people psychotic symptom ; ( 4 ) study determinant clinical presentation non-presentation people psychotic symptom . Design , subject study instrument The survey conduct two-phase design . The first phase interview include approximately 5,000 subject structured assessment serve diagnostic criterion CMD , screen instrument psychotic disorder , substance misuse suicidal behaviour , function , service use demographic . The second phase comprise clinician interview psychotic disorder `` risk mental state '' variable include neurocognitive , help seek , stigma well-being . Analysis Prevalence estimate weight , express rate confidence interval . Comorbidity estimate use Latent Class Analysis ( LCA ) Logistic regression use identify significant factor associate mental disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psychotic disorder ( include schizophrenia ) complex neurobehaviour disorder influence genetic , neurodevelopmental , neurochemical , well psychosocial factor . Amongst risk factor , recent finding highlight role immigration , urban upbringing , high paternal age , psychoactive substance abuse , well stressful early experience . Despite significant progress pharmacotherapy , disorder often result long-term disability rank globally amongst top ten leading cause disability-adjusted life year ( DALYS , WHO ) . The World health Organization conclude burden human suffer associate psychosis extensive result high service societal cost . Identification treatment psychotic disorder ( sometimes refer Severe Mental Illness , SMI ) priority mental health service worldwide . However effort challenge help-seeking severely compromised reluctance , stigmatization , lack knowledge , poor accessibility . This result long delay treatment , well lack information community prevalence , associate disability risk factor psychosis ( ref DUP paper ) . Availability data Hong Kong facilitate service planning , early detection intervention effort , well consideration population level preventative strategy . Availability data suggest prevalence psychosis community substantially high ( 5.5-28 % , vanos 09 ) prevalence treat disorder ( 1-3.5 % , vanos09 ) , raise important question determine whether psychotic disorder intercept particular service set . It vital also obtain information untreated case , term risk factor protective factor , disability , well obstacles help-seeking . Community level data psychotic disorder Hong Kong sparse territory-wide population-level epidemiology . The Hong Kong population several distinctive feature particular scientific interest public health concern relation psychosis . Although overall prevalence substance abuse low , disproportionate use ketamine Hong Kong , interfere glutaminergic neurotransmission . The relationship ketamine use risk psychosis aetiological clinical interest . In addition , unique societal context Hong Kong result high proportion immigrant China . Moreover , cohort people relatively high paternal age enter risk period develop psychotic disorder ( result old man Hong Kong young woman neighbour part China previous decade ) . Previous relevant study include district survey , quarter century old , limited generalization value uneven socioeconomic distribution amongst Hong Kong 's 18 district , result likely uneven distribution individual psychosis amongst . Other relevant data include data treat new onset case Hong Kong 's early intervention service ( EASY , annual incidence least 600 case 25 , estimate 1200-1500 age group ) , limitation treat incidence discuss . The investigator propose territory-wide epidemiological study psychosis . The study aim ( 1 ) measure prevalence psychotic symptom Hong Kong population ; ( 2 ) explore associate risk protective factor expression psychotic symptom ; ( 3 ) characterize functional disability people psychotic symptom ; ( 4 ) study determinant clinical presentation non-presentation people psychotic symptom .</detailed_description>
