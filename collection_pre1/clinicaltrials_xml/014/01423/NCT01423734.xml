	<brief_summary>Imaging CT ( Computed Tomography ) MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) normally use see tumor respond treatment . If tumor shrink therapy , doctor continue treatment . On hand , grow tumor patient bring change therapy . Unfortunately , often take three six month , even longer investigator see tumor shrink grow scan . Doctors look new imaging tool look tumor respond early treatment . This study help u decide MRI technology call DWI ( Diffusion Weighted Imaging ) use helpful imaging tool .</brief_summary>
