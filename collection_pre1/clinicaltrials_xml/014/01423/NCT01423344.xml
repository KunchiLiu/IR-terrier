	<brief_summary>Background : patient multiple myeloma raise level protein , name M-protein . This M-protein normally use monitor disease status evaluate response treatment , decrease M-protein take evidence therapeutic efficacy . However , M-protein long half life serum , approximately three week , tend practical problem , since investigator first determine hereafter treatment effective . A new assay possibility measure part protein , namely `` light chain '' , also measure blood sample . The half life light chain much short , namely 2-6 hour . In theory , mean rapid measure effect give treatment , thereby able determine earlier treatment continue change another strategy . Purpose : purpose study evaluate clinical value use serum free light chain ( sFLC ) assay comparison M-protein monitoring patient treatment multiple myeloma . Method : investigator measure sFLC patient receive 1st treatment , either time diagnosis relapse set . sFLC measure regular basis , result compare M-protein .</brief_summary>
