	<detailed_description>Clinical management heart failure ( HF ) relate obesity diet recommendation currently lack strong scientific basis , clinician divide approach diet recommendation patient population . It show extremely obese HF patient , weight reduction improve cardiac structure function well functional status symptomatology . Evidence impact voluntary weight loss improvement survival obese HF patient , however , limited . The purpose study determine whether heart failure patient participate 3-month intensive lifestyle modification program either high protein ( 30 % total calorie protein ) group significant improvement weight reduction , quality life clinical outcome compare standardized protein ( 15 % total calorie protein ) group . In addition dietary intervention , participant group give exercise prescription encourage exercise 20-30 minute least 3-5 time week tolerate . They also continue receive usual medical care , advice support condition cardiologist medical physician . Both set participant utilize self-monitoring tool assist diet compliance behavior change . These self-monitoring tool mandatory collect analyzed . At visit , subject also ask also ask weight waist circumference measure , select visit , provide 24 hour recall ass fullness overall diet . Subjects give 3-day food ( 3DFR ) record baseline , return 2-week , 4- week 8-week visit , also complete 3DFR three month .</detailed_description>
