	<brief_summary>The myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) , notably polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) , primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) diverse inter-related suite clonal disorder pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell ( Tefferi et al. , 2008 ) . The MPN share range biological , pathological , clinical feature include relative overproduction one cell myeloid origin , growth factor independent colony formation vitro , marrow hypercellularity , extramedullary hematopoiesis , spleno- hepatomegaly , thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses ( Tefferi et al. , 2005 ) . This multi-centre , open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation study , conduct two phase : dose-escalation phase ( Part 1 ) , determine safety tolerability momelotinib ( CYT387 ) , identify therapeutic dose expand cohort ; dose-confirmation phase ( Part 2 ) , cohort expansion MTD momelotinib . In Part I dose-escalation phase study , subject assign dose level successive cohort start dose first cohort 200 mg BID ( twice daily dos take approximately 12 hour apart ) . Doses escalate 50 mg BID per cohort dose-limiting toxicity observe . The dose level ≥2 6 subject develop first cycle dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define DLT level . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) define dose level DLT level . New dose level may begin accrual subject current dose level observe minimum 28 day first day treatment . The dose level choose study dose confirmation phase study MTD low dose show significant clinical activity ( efficacy ) determine safety review committee . Subjects evaluate weekly first cycle , every 2 week cycle 2 , monthly 4 cycle total 6 cycle . In dose-confirmation phase study , approximately fifty ( 50 ) subject treat MTD low dose show significant clinical activity ( efficacy ) choose Safety Review Committee . In dose confirmation phase study subject evaluate every 2 week first treatment cycle , monthly 5 cycle total 6 cycle .</brief_summary>
