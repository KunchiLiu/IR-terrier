	<brief_summary>The FB-8 study design open label , single arm , Phase I dose-escalation study evaluate combination weekly paclitaxel neratinib trastuzumab woman metastatic , HER2-positive breast cancer . The primary aim study determine safety tolerability three-drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Weekly Paclitaxel With Neratinib Trastuzumab Women With Metastatic HER2-positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive concurrent therapy paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle ) , trastuzumab ( 4 mg/kg IV loading dose , 2 mg/kg IV weekly ) , neratinib . The neratinib dose-escalation include 4 dose level ( 120 mg , 160 mg , 200 mg , 240 mg ) daily oral dose . The neratinib dose-escalation study proceed basis dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) cycle 1 . DLT define occurrence 1 follow event cycle 1 : grade diarrhea associate fever dehydration ; grade 3 diarrhea last 2 day optimal medical therapy ; grade 4 diarrhea duration ; grade 3 4 neutropenia associate fever ; grade 4 neutropenia last 7 day ; grade 4 thrombocytopenia ; grade 3 4 non-hematological toxicity ; toxicity-related delay 2 week initiate cycle 2 . Patients enrol next dose level evaluable patient dose level complete first treatment cycle . Enrolled patient remain assigned dose level treatment toxicity disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Comorbid condition take consideration , diagnosis metastatic breast cancer . Patients reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception therapy least 6 month last dose study therapy . The ECOG performance status must 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients must ability swallow oral medication . Patients must histologic cytologic confirmation diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast . There must documentation patient evidence ( measurable nonmeasurable ) metastatic breast cancer . Histologic confirmation metastatic disease require . Patients must ER analysis perform primary tumor prior study entry . If ER analysis negative , PgR analysis must also perform . ( Patients eligible either hormone receptorpositive hormone receptornegative tumor . ) Breast cancer must determine HER2positive prior study entry . Assays use FISH CISH require gene amplification . Assays use IHC require strongly positive ( 3+ ) stain score . At time study entry , blood count perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet following criterion : ANC must great equal 1000/mm3 ; Platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; Hemoglobin must great equal 9 g/dL The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet : total bilirubin must less equal 1.5 x ULN ; AST ALT must less equal 2.5 x ULN lab less equal 5 x ULN liver metastasis Serum creatinine perform within 4 week prior study entry must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . The LVEF assessment 2D echocardiogram MUGA scan perform within 90 day prior study entry must great equal 50 % regardless facility 's LLN . Previous therapy neratinib malignancy . Symptomatic brain metastasis brain metastasis require chronic steroid control symptom . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C abnormal liver function test . Intrinsic lung disease result dyspnea . Active infection chronic infection require chronic suppressive antibiotic . Malabsorption syndrome , ulcerative colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , resection stomach small bowel , disease condition significantly affect gastrointestinal function . Persistent great equal grade 2 diarrhea regardless etiology . Sensory motor neuropathy great equal grade 2 , define NCI CTCAE v3.0 . Conditions would prohibit intermittent administration corticosteroid paclitaxel premedication . Chronic daily treatment corticosteroid dose great equal 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent ( exclude inhale steroid ) . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic BP great 150 mmHg diastolic BP great 90 mmHg , without antihypertensive medication ( Patients hypertension well control medication eligible . ) Cardiac disease ( history and/or active disease ) would preclude use drug include treatment regimen . This include confine : Active cardiac disease : symptomatic angina pectoris within past 90 day require initiation increase antianginal medication intervention ; ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction ; supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication ; conduction abnormality require pacemaker ; valvular disease document compromise cardiac function ; symptomatic pericarditis . History cardiac disease : myocardial infarction document elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment LV function ; history document CHF ; document cardiomyopathy Other nonmalignant systemic disease would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require follow . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( Note : Pregnancy test perform within 14 day prior study entry accord institutional standard woman childbearing potential . ) The investigator ass patient determine psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude meeting study requirement . Use investigational agent within 4 week prior study entry .</criteria>
