	<brief_summary>The investigator previously show frequency 15.95-16.00 Hz protect acute myocardial infarction rat . In current study investigator would like investigate whether frequency enables cardiac patient exercise-induced chest pain exercise high workload heart rate . Therefore , patient undergo two exercise stress test , one test expose 30 minute mention frequency another test expose sham ( frequency turn ON ) . The investigator measure change electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , workload , exercise time , subjective measure chest pain ( angina ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Low Frequency Magnetic Field Exercise Induced Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study show low frequency electromagnetic field biological therapeutic potential human body , however , limited extent heart . In current study cardiac patient suffer exercise-induced-angina undergo two consecutive stress test , one test expose 30 minute magnetic field test expose placebo ( magnetic field operate ) . The order magnet operate randomly assign patient group patient expose magnetic field first stress test another group patient expose magnetic field second stress test . During rest period , patient subject magnetic field , 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitor . Thereafter magnetic field frequency turn patient subject graded exercise stress test monitor ECG blood pressure change . Similar monitoring documented recovery period follow stress test . In addition , patient grade angina score documented stress test . The data compare two stress test document advantageous magnetic field exercise time , workload , ECG change and/or chest pain .</detailed_description>
