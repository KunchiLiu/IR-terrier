	<brief_summary>The investigator aim examine skeletal muscle human volunteer respond experimental septic condition aid understanding muscle waste biology.. Six healthy men age 18-30 randomly assign two metabolic study visit . On first visit , rest bed , four cannulae insert include one upper thigh , blood sample infusion insulin , glucose normal tracer amino acid ( allow u measure muscle protein metabolism ) . Subjects receive either injection purify bacterial product call lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induce flu-like symptom normal saline accord randomization follow metabolic test stimulate muscle synthesis glucose transport . Three small sample muscle obtain local anaesthetic thigh measure molecular event muscle . By perform measurement , investigator determine consequence LPS muscle production carbohydrate metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Lipopolysaccharide Skeletal Muscle Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During sepsis , ability body prevent muscle waste impaired resulting loss skeletal muscle . In addition , skeletal muscle handle carbohydrate becomes less efficient . These change could result delayed recovery , prolonged rehabilitation severe case mortality patient . It still unclear change occur human skeletal muscle animal experiment suggest protein molecule release sepsis responsible change . Due biological difference animal human metabolic rate stability , disease susceptibility response infection , simple translation knowledge animal patient could highly mislead . Therefore , aim examine skeletal muscle human volunteer respond experimental septic condition . Following medical screening , six healthy men age 18-30 two metabolic study visit random manner . On first visit , rest bed , four cannulae insert include one upper thigh , blood sample infusion insulin , glucose normal tracer amino acid ( allow u measure muscle protein metabolism ) . Subjects receive either injection purify bacterial product call lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induce flu-like symptom normal saline accord randomization follow metabolic test stimulate muscle synthesis glucose transport . Three small sample muscle obtain local anaesthetic thigh measure molecular event muscle . By perform measurement , determine consequence LPS muscle production carbohydrate metabolism .</detailed_description>
