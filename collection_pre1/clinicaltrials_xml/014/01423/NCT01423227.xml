	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation effective treatment people chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) improve symptom , reduces hospitalisation lower healthcare cost . However less 1 % Australians COPD receive pulmonary rehabilitation year , due poor access program high level disability . This randomise controlled trial examine benefit cost novel , entirely home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program COPD . We hypothesise home-based pulmonary rehabilitation deliver equivalent clinical outcome low cost centre-based program . We randomly allocate 144 people COPD undertake either standard pulmonary rehabilitation hospital setting , low-cost home-based program . Those undertake pulmonary rehabilitation hospital set attend hospital twice week eight week supervise exercise training education . People home pulmonary rehabilitation group receive one home visit weekly telephone call eight week , supervision mentoring exercise provision education . We compare number people complete program setting . We also test whether group similar result standard pulmonary rehabilitation outcome breathlessness , quality life exercise capacity , end program 12 month later . We compare health care cost personal cost group 12 month . If home-based pulmonary rehabilitation improve uptake important treatment , deliver good clinical outcome reduce cost significant long-lasting benefit patient , community health system</brief_summary>
