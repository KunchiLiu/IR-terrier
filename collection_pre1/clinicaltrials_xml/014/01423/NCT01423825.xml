	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response HIV Vaccine Boost Following Administration Two HIV Vaccines , HIV-Uninfected , Healthy Adults ( Study Extension HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 study evaluate safety two experimental HIV vaccines—SAAVI DNA-C2 SAAVI MVA-C—given sequentially prime-boost regimen healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . This extension study enroll people participate HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 study . Previous study show protein vaccine boost HIV vaccine may improve antibody response . This study evaluate safety immune response HIV envelope protein vaccine—the Sub C gp140 vaccine MF59 adjuvant—in healthy , HIV-uninfected adult previously participate HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 study . Study researcher explore whether addition protein boost vaccine SAAVI DNA-C2 SAAVI MVA-C vaccine regimen improve antibody response . This study enroll people participate HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 study , regardless whether receive vaccine placebo . Participants randomly assign receive either Sub C gp140 vaccine MF59 adjuvant placebo injection study visit baseline Month 3 . At baseline Month 3 visit , participant undergo physical examination , HIV test counseling , pregnancy test female participant , interview questionnaire , risk reduction counseling , blood collection ( baseline visit ) . They receive assign vaccine placebo one injection upper arm . Participants remain clinic 30 minute receive vaccination observation monitoring . For 3 day vaccination , participant record side effect symptom log make contact daily study site staff . Additional study visit occur Weeks 1 2 , 1 2 week Month 3 visit , Months 6 9 . At visit , select baseline study procedure occur . At Month 15 , study staff contact participant follow-up health monitoring . Participants complete annual health contact original HVTN 073/SAAVI 102 study .</detailed_description>
