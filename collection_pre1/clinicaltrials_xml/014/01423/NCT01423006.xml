	<brief_title>Pilot Study Focal Prostate Radio-Frequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RFA minimally invasive procedure . It image-guided technique heat destroy cancer cell . In RFA , image technique ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use help guide needle electrode cancerous tumor . High-frequency electrical current pass electrode , destroy cancer cell . Use RFA device approve Food Drug Association ( FDA ) 1997 purpose treat soft tissue tumor . The device ( Moffitt Cancer Center ) use study clearance clinical use FDA . The effectiveness device measure use biopsy core site cancer RFA procedure . To evaluate benefit procedure , also evaluate change quality-of-life indicator baseline 6 month follow RFA . RFA develop minimally invasive potential treatment prostate cancer . This research study pilot clinical trial . Pilot clinical trial small version large study conduct prepare large study . This pilot study pre-tests research device large-scale multicenter study launch . The specific purpose pilot trial find RFA effectively treat prostate cancer few side effect include effect urination , bowel function , sexual function . RFA early stage prostate cancer design affect part prostate cancer detect . The reason approach small area give RFA , less damage surround tissue .</detailed_description>
