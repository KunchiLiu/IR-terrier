	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect ankle tap improve muscle function ankle motion individual frequently twist ( sprain ) ankle . It think ankle tap may increase muscle function ankle motion would benefit individual frequently sprain ankle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Ankle Support Muscle Activation Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research demonstrate improved dynamic balance follow application fibular tap . The effect fibular tap ankle dorsiflexion ROM muscle activation individual CAI unknown . The purpose study determine acute effect fibular tap muscle activation fibularis longus ( peroneus ) soleus muscle , ankle dorsiflexion range motion ( ROM ) dynamic balance . The investigator hypothesize fibular tap similar effectiveness mobilization intervention show improve muscle activation , ankle dorsiflexion ROM , dynamic balance . Outcomes measure immediately intervention . A crossover design use participant complete two visit least 48 hour apart , 1 week apart . After participant complete arm study participation complete ( average time completion subject 1 week ) .</detailed_description>
