	<brief_summary>This study set final study end point three detailed goal follow . The main objective study : This trial do assess safety benefit robotic resection compare conventional laparoscopy-assisted resection curative treatment patient cancer mid low rectum . Detailed goal study : The primary endpoint : This study design ass whether robotic surgical system improve quality rectal cancer surgery , especially total mesorectal excision quality circumferential margin positivity rate The secondary endpoint : This study aim compare 3- 5-year disease-free survival overall survival robot laparoscopic resection distal rectal cancer . This study also assess pelvic autonomic nerve preservation , short-term morbidity , pathological quality ( i.e . number harvest lymph node ) , local recurrence , blood loss surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Assess Robot-assisted Surgery Laparoscopy-assisted Surgery Patients With Mid Low Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , efficacy oncological safety laparoscopy demonstrate treat colon cancer , similar long-term result 5-year confirmed several multicenter study trial . However , conventional laparoscopic surgery rectal cancer technically difficult colonic resection confine space pelvis limitation exist laparoscopic instrument restrict range movement compare provide surgeon 's hand . Consequently , recent study compare short-term outcome open laparoscopic rectal resection report high rate conversion open surgery , positive circumferential margin , increase anastomotic leakage patient underwent laparoscopic approach . The da VinciÂ® Surgical System ( Intuitive surgical , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) introduce next advance minimally invasive surgery overcome technical limitation laparoscopy . The advantage robotic assistance include enhance dexterity , improve three-dimensional vision , intuitive instrument manipulation . This device ease technical challenge minimally invasive approach may make complex surgical task accessible surgeon without extensive laparoscopic experience . With dependence precise dissection narrow pelvic cavity , anticipated rectal cancer surgery one indication likely benefit robot assistance . However , difficult conclude whether robot assistance lead good outcome study directly compare three exist technique . Although robotic rectal excision report safe feasible recent literature , number result base small number case series . There randomized trial demonstrate safety robotic surgery treatment rectal cancer . This study design assess efficacy safety robotic surgery compare laparoscopic surgery mid low rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
