	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) establish therapy neurological psychiatric disorder , one important therapy functional neurosurgery date . Class I evidence show subthalamic nucleus stimulation ( STN ) Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) effective best medical therapy ( 1,2 ) . Globus pallidus internus stimulation primary dystonia improvement rate 70 % ( 4 ) consider main surgical treatment pathology . Symptom improvement essential tremor well document . Pain , epilepsy , psychiatric disorder Tourette syndrome , obsessive - compulsive disorder depression promise application DBS . Obesity , memory improvement , aggressiveness , drug addiction , minimal conscious state hypertension area continue investigation potential application DBS . The clinical effect DBS result delivery electrical charge brain tissue . The way electrical charge deliver depend electronics implantable pulse generator ( IPGs ) . IPGs apply pulse electrical stimulation voltage current increase zero maximum value period time ( order ten microsecond ) return zero . There two type IPGs , differ whether voltage electrical current control ( 3 ) . 1 . Constant - voltage IPGs : type IPG control maximum voltage associate pulse . The maximum current vary depending impedance . A specific voltage program . The amount electrical current deliver constant voltage depend impedance tissue electrode . Thus , voltage indicate much electrical current give ; resistance determine parameter . 2 . Constant - current IPGs : provide specific electrical current automatically adjust voltage depend impedance . The strength stimulation remain regardless change impedance . The difference impedance electrode intersubject variability impedance alter electrical current modifying voltage . Until fairly recently , constant voltage IPG 's available use . A new generation IPG 's available year provide either constant voltage constant current accord physician patient preference . There evidence yet support preferential use one modality . IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY Following DBS electrode implantation , impedance within patient vary widely . Surgical implantation change tissue impedance , usually higher immediately surgery . In case patient require high electrical current . After initial tissue reaction subsides , reduction impedance generate increase charge density . For reason commonplace wait least 2 week electrode implantation program IPG . Furthermore , different contact DBS lead widely varying impedance . Effects side effect associate stimulation one electrode contact often apply different contact DBS lead patient impedance may differ . The range impedance measure depend choice voltage . In patient , voltage use therapeutically may enough allow accurate measure impedance , cause confusion regard structural electrical integrity IPG . For mentioned factor , clinical result patient constant - voltage IPGs depend experience operator deal different aspect relate tissue electrode impedance achieve desire current . The electronic property constant - current IPGs allow system make voltage adjustment order maintain desire current subsequent clinical effect . This theoretical background development constant current IPG 's ; whether theory true practice subject study .</detailed_description>
