	<brief_summary>Rheumatic Polymyalgia ( PMR ) relatively common chronic inflammatory disorder unknown origin predominantly develop elderly subject present severe pain stiffness neck , shoulder pelvic girdle , along increase acute phase reactant . Systemic manifestation fever , anorexia weight loss characteristic signature PMR . Corticosteroids ( CS ) constitute standard treatment PMR . Although patient symptoms disease disappear one two year treatment , proportion patient remain CS-dependent subsequent CS toxicity . Open label study suggest tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) antagonists lead sustain improvement CS spar effect patient refractory PMR . The investigator conduct randomised , double-blind , placebo control trial infliximab CS-dependent patient PMR . Patients CS-dependent PMR ( define require ≥ 5 mg/day least 2 year treatment maintain remission ≥ 7.5 mg/day least 6 month ) randomly assign receive Infliximab ( 5 mg/kg i.v ) 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 22 week ( n = 12 ) placebo ( n = 11 ) together CS reduce accord predefined schedule . The primary outcome proportion responder patient -defined individual complete clinical analytical remission without receive CS least three months- 24 week . Secondary outcome cumulative CS dose adverse event proportion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration study 1 year , divide several phase : A ) Initial phase ( double-blind trial ) : Between week 0 week 24 . Placebo Infliximab dose 3 mg/kg/day week 0 , 2 6 . After screen process , patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion protocol randomize receive three infusion placebo infliximab previously describe . After first infusion ( week 0 ) , prednisone dose taper accord follow schedule : Prednisone ( equivalent ) decrease rate 1.25 mg per week complete withdrawal corticosteroid . In case relapse , dose prednisone increase previous dose control symptom PMR , 4 week stable dose , prednisone taper slow schedule : 1.25 mg every 2 week complete withdrawal corticosteroid . In case new relapse , dose prednisone manage accord physician criterion . B ) Extension phase ( open trial ) : Between week 24 week 48 . Infliximab dose 3 mg/kg/day week 24 , 26 30 . At 24 week , patient include trial still corticosteroid therapy without clinical manifestation PMR , receive three infusion infliximab accord previous described schedule . After first infusion ( week 24 ) dose prednisone decrease accord schedule previously describe initial phase trial . The schedule therapy propose extension phase go : - ( GROUP A ) To evaluate time response Infliximab responder concern active treatment group phase 1 . - ( GROUP B ) . To incorporate patient placebo- treated treatment show efficacy ( case favorable result interim analysis ) - ( GROUP C ) . To offer maintenance treatment patient show complete response phase 1 treatment associate significant corticosteroid taper dose maintenance response . - ( GROUP D ) . Discontinuation treatment patient receive active treatment phase 1 show response time . After first infusion ( week 24 ) , reduce prednisone dose follow regimen describe clinical phase study . Treatment duration . •Study administrate 24 + 24 week . In end study patient continue treatment efficacy investigator opinion . Objectives : Primary objective : Proportion responder ( complete remission without corticosteroid ) 24 week . Secondary objective : - Proportion responder 48 week . - Time response - Number relapse / recurrence . - Response duration - Cumulative dose side effect steroids 24 48 week . - Number patient re-treated infliximab . - Side effect Infliximab patient population . - Serum cytokine analysis I ) CLINICAL ASSESSMENT : Evaluations perform screening , baseline , every 2 week first 2 month treatment monthly thereafter . The following data record visit : - A structured questionnaire symptom PMR . - Global evaluation disease activity patient physician ( visual analogue scale , 0-100 ) . - Global evaluation pain patient ( visual analogue scale , 0-100 ) . - Acute phase reactant : ESR ( Westergren ) CRP ( nephelometry ) . - Complete blood cell count , glucose ( glycosylated hemoglobin case diabetes ) , blood urea creatinine , liver enzymes albumin . - Steroid dosage . Cumulative steroid dosage study period . - Presence relapse - Side effect , special emphasis infection corticosteroid side effect . All patient PPD test chest X-rays perform screen follow current recommendation anti-TNF therapy ( 50-52 ) . Those patient positive PPD test ( induration ≥ 5 mm ) chest X-ray image show lesion consistent latent tuberculosis infection , prophylactic treatment isoniazid , 300 mg daily 9 month ( case isoniazid toxicity : rifamycin , 600 mg/day four month ) . In addition , patient instruct possible development infection side effect , new manifestation GCA , immediately report attend physician . II ) SERUM CYTOKINE STUDY During study period inform consent , patient ask provide serum sample ( around 200 ml ) 7 different time point ( week 0 pre-treatment , week 2 , 6 , 24 , 26 , 30 48 ) . The blood obtain time schedule venipuncture routine test . The analysis do use Cytometric Bead Array ( CBA ) methodology . The investigator use CBA Flex Set system ( Becton Dickinson ) include follow cytokine : IL-1 , IL-6 , TGF-beta , TNF-alfa , IL-10 , IL-12 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IFN-gamma . Following acquisition sample data use FACSCalibur flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) , sample result generate graphical tabular format use CBA Analysis Software ( Becton Dickinson ) . Group I : Infliximab 5 mg/kg . i.v . week 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 22 . Group II : Infliximab Placebo i.v . week 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 22 . Extension Phase ( week 24-48 ) : 1 . Responders week 24 : Treatment discontinuation ( GROUP A ) . 2 . No-responders week 24 : - Placebo group : infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) week 24 , 26 , 30 , 36 42 ( GROUP B ) . - Infliximab group : - Patients lose response phase 1 week 24 receive infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) week 30 , 36 42 ( GROUP C ) . - Patients never fulfil response criterion Phase 1 : receive treatment extension phase .
