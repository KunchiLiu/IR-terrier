	<brief_title>Phase 1 , Open-label Trial Determine Safety OPB-51602 Subjects With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study base data support role signal transducer activator transcription ( STAT ) family proteins oncogenesis . One mechanisms action OPB-51602 include inhibition STAT3 phosphorylation . Therefore OPB-51602 expect active anti-cancer drug . This first-in-human study characterize safety profile OPB-51602 , evaluate pharmacokinetics OPB-51602 , identify recommend phase II dose , obtain preliminary efficacy data , subject advance cancer standard treatment available .</detailed_description>
