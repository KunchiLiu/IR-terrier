	<brief_title>The Study Quantitative Serial Trends Lipids With ApolpoproteinA-I Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-third US population , almost 80 million adult , cardiovascular disease mortality associate heart disease still remain leading cause death around world . The major risk factor cardiovascular disease associate atherosclerosis dyslipidemia , characterize high level low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and/or low level high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) . The widespread use statins patient risk cardiovascular disease lead low LDL level little effect HDL level . HDL well establish role atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease protection . HDL mediate removal cholesterol atherosclerotic plaque elimination body . The major component HDL consist apolipoprotein A-I ( ApoA I ) . Recent intervention study synthetic HDL particle recombinant ApoA-I show HDL capacity reverse coronary atherosclerosis . Increasing ApoA-I likely favorable effect atherosclerotic plaque stability size cardiovascular disease . RVX000222 member novel class small molecule candidate treatment dyslipidemia increase plasma level HDL increase ApoA-I transcription .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient 's ≥ 18 year age without documented coronary artery disease 2 . Women childbearing potential , , woman surgically sterilize menarche 1 year post menopause , must test negative pregnancy time enrollment base serum pregnancy test agree use reliable method birth control ( example , use oral contraceptive levonorgestrel ) ; reliable barrier method birth control ( diaphragms contraceptive jelly ; cervical cap contraceptive jelly ; condom contraceptive foam ; intrauterine device ; partner vasectomy ; abstinence ) study one month follow last dose study drug . 3 . HDLC requirement . Current ( Local lab within 60 day central lab result prior Visit 1 ) : HDLC ≤45 mg/dL ( 1.17 mmol/L ) female , HDLC ≤40 mg/dL ( 1.04 mmol/L ) males 4 . Taking statin therapy least 30 day prior screen ( Visit 1 ) , investigator opinion , unlikely need statin dose adjustment course study . 5 . In opinion investigator patient currently statin therapy atorvastatin ( 10mg , 20mg 40mg ) rosuvastatin ( 5mg , 10mg 20 mg ) switch rosuvastatin ( 5mg , 10mg 20mg ) Visit 1 . 1 . Clinically significant heart disease require coronary bypass , PCI , cardiac transplantation , surgical repair and/or replacement course study . 2 . Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedure within past 90 day . 3 . Previous current diagnosis severe heart failure ( NYHA Class IIIIV ) document left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 25 % determine contrast leave ventriculography , radionuclide ventriculography echocardiography absence LVEF measurement patient without previous current diagnosis heart failure prohibit entry study . 4 . Patients evidence cardiac electrophysiologic instability include history uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter uncontrolled supraventricular tachycardia ventricular response heart rate &gt; 100 beat per minute rest within 4 week prior Visit 1 . 5 . Evidence renal impairment determine one following : 1. serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ( &gt; 133 micromol/L ) screen Visit 1 2. history dialysis 3. history nephritic syndrome 6 . Have hypertension uncontrolled define 2 consecutive measurement sit blood pressure systolic &gt; 160 mm Hg diastolic &gt; 95 mm Hg Visit 1 . 7 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive betahCG laboratory test ( ≥5 mIU/mL ) . 8 . Current recent ( within 12 month prior Visit 1 ) treatment immunosuppressant ( eg , Cyclosporine ) . 9 . Triglycerides &gt; 400 mg/dL screen Visit 1 . 10 . Atorvastatin &gt; 40 mg daily 11 . Rosuvastatin &gt; 20 mg daily 12 . Use fibrates dose niacin/nicotinic acid 250 mg within 90 day prior Visit 1 . 13 . Any medical surgical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion medication include , limited following : cholecystitis , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , gastric bypass alteration . 14 . Evidence hepatic disease determine one following : ALT , AST GGT value &gt; ULN central lab screening , Visit 1 history hepatic encephalopathy , history Hepatitis B , C E , history esophageal varix , history portocaval shunt . 15 . A total bilirubin &gt; ULN central lab screening , Visit 1 . 16 . History malignancy organ system , treat untreated , within past 5 year whether evidence local recurrence metastasis , exception localize basal cell carcinoma skin . 17 . History evidence drug alcohol abuse within last 12 month . 18 . Any surgical medical condition , opinion investigator , may place patient high risk his/her participation study , likely prevent patient comply requirement study complete study . 19 . Use investigational drug device time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives enrollment , whichever longer . 20 . History noncompliance medical regimen unwillingness comply study protocol . 21 . Any condition opinion investigator would confound evaluation interpretation efficacy and/or safety data . 22 . Persons directly involved execution protocol</criteria>
