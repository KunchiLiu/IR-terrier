	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) combination multi-organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) life-threatening condition , particularly treatment modality extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) catecholamine administration fail treat severe condition . In study , investigator report patient respond intrapleural steroid instillation ( IPSI ) unresponsive conventional treatment ( use intravenous steroid , nitric oxide inhalation , high-frequency oscillatory ventilation , ECMO ) treatment critical illness ARDS combination MODS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) multi-organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) common debilitate postoperative complication , also result shock trauma . However , despite use ECMO , mortality rate among hypoxia patient remain high critical care condition . Corticosteroid therapy inhibits ongoing inflammation abnormal deposition collagen . However , intravenous administration corticosteroid may harmful may increase risk associate neuromyopathy critically ill patient . Although intrapleural instillation steroid employ several pleural disease , little know therapeutic effect treatment method ARDS combination MODS . Therefore , present pilot study , investigator hypothesize timely initiation intrapleural steroid instillation ( IPSI ) positively influence ventilation survival patient ARDS combination MODS . The investigator conduct retrospective study ninety-two 467 ECMOs perform 2005 2009 ARDS patient . Analyses gas exchange , tidal volume , airway pressure , respiratory frequency , vasopressor sedation requirement perform intervention . The indication IPSI unresponsive severe ARDS combination MODS treatment modality intravenous steroid administration , nitric oxide inhalation , high-frequency oscillatory ventilation , ECMO perform within 2 day unsuccessful . An experienced team perform thoracic catheterization patient ultrasound evaluation . Patients severe pleural adhesion consider unsuitable IPSI . The dosage intrapleural steroid determine basis chest radiographic examination , inspire oxygen concentration , positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) ventilator .</detailed_description>
