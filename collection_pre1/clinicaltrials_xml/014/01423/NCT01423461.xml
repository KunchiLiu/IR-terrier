	<brief_summary>`` Individualized health care '' refers development strategy disease management health promotion inform specific data genetics physiological process uniquely determine person 's health profile potential responsiveness intervention susceptibility environmental exposure . Asthma , inflammatory disorder airway , appear determined multiple interacting genetic environmental factor . Such risk factor include allergic response , small airway , excess body weight , specific property airway smooth muscle , airway generalize metabolic inflammatory homeostasis , exposures environmental irritant , allergen , psychosocial stressor . To date , asthma treatment strategy guide `` severity '' guideline rather characteristic child 's specific phenotype ( child 's underlying allergic tendency , extent airway inflammation airway smooth muscle dysfunction , underlie obesity metabolic perturbation ) . The grow availability new class asthma medication directly target specific pathophysiological derangement require access data child 's asthma risk profile optimize selection medication intervention specifically address underlie pathophysiology minimize adverse treatment side effect . The investigator propose develop model program collect relevant clinical information genetic data high risk group asthmatic child , include data common co-morbidities , specifically obesity sleep disorder ; use information develop comprehensive model database characterize child accord health profile ; use characterization initiate target intervention , continue long term follow child determine differential responsiveness medication .</brief_summary>
