	<brief_summary>Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) transient neurological deficit ( speech disturbance , weakness… ) , cause temporary occlusion brain vessel blood clot leave lasting effect . TIA diagnosis challenge expert stroke evaluation combine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could improve diagnosis accuracy . The risk debilitate stroke high 5 % first 72 hr TIA . TIA characteristic ( duration , type symptom , age patient ) , presence significant narrow neck vessel responsible patient 's symptom ( symptomatic stenosis ) , abnormal MRI associate increase risk stroke . An emergent evaluation treatment TIA patient stroke specialist could reduce risk stroke 2 % . Stanford implement expedited triage pathway TIA patient combine clinical evaluation stroke neurologist , acute MRI brain vessel sample biomarkers ( Lp-PLA2 ) . The investigator investigate yield unique approach improve TIA diagnosis , prognosis secondary stroke prevention . The objective prospective cohort study determine factor help physician confirm diagnosis TIA define risk stroke TIA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) Triage Evaluation Stroke Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients clinical suspicion TIA see Stanford Emergency Department , admit Clinical Decision Area ( CDA ) . The CDA short duration ( &lt; 24 hr ) ) hospitalization unit , patient receive expedite evaluation monitor comfortable set ED . Patients evaluated neurologist ( resident fellow stroke attend ) . Clinical information collect dedicated chart . Evaluation : As recommended AHA , absence contraindication , patient undergo MRI brain neck vessel evaluation part standard care . This exam obtain within 6 hour patient admission emergency department . The diffusion sequence brain MRI detect presence acute injury relate blood clot ( ischemic injury ) , perfusion sequence capture abnormal intra-cerebral blood flow . The sequence exclude presence brain lesion susceptible explain transient symptom present patient . The MR angiogram ( MRA ) neck intracranial vessel detect presence symptomatic stenosis would require emergent treatment . In case MRI contraindication , patient undergo CT head neck combine neck intracranial vessel evaluation perfusion image . As recommended , patient get EKG cardiovascular examination part routine care . As recommended , patient get standard lab evaluation part routine care include general chemistry , hematology , coagulation , lipid profile , Hb A1C ) , indicate , specific prothrombotic inflammatory evaluation . In approximately 100 patient - AS PART OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL - investigator evaluate level lipoprotein A2 L one time point . This biomarker associate one publication increase risk vascular event among TIA patient . After informed consent , investigator perform standard venipuncture draw 10 mL blood per patient . The blood collect serum gel separator tube . The serum keep cold , separated gel cell within 2 hour . The specimen freeze -70C analysis perform diaDexus lab sponsor part study . - As part routine triage pathway , patient initial normal clinical , radiological biological evaluation evaluate within next 12 hour attend stroke neurologist determine whether patient could safely discharge hospital , treatment plan include risk factor management antithrombotic treatment . This treatment initiated hospital patient discharge . In follow guideline , majority patient hospitalize less 24 hour . - As part routine triage pathway , patient see stroke neurologist and/or stroke train nurse practitioner within next 2 week Stanford outpatient TIA clinic . All patient routinely receive follow telephone call 1 month , 3 month 1 year evaluate occurrence stroke myocardial infarction and/or vascular death . In instance , one visit clinically indicate in-person visit . If case , data in-person clinic visit use part study rather telephone visit . The clinical characteristic TIA , radiological result , biological result follow information collect use research protocol consent patient . The investigator include patient evaluate new pathway since 's inception January 2010 . This patient population include chart review . The chart review data point extract medical record use part research . An additional arm add 2012 : A biomarker ischemia may help physician confirm diagnosis TIA , help stratify risk among patient negative brain imaging . Researchers UC Davis , evaluate gene expression profile stroke circulate leucocyte . They isolate specific gene expression profile associate transient brain ischemia . The aim study define whether gene expression proteomic profile may help detect ischemic mechanism transient neurological symptom stratify risk future stroke patient negative MRI . We prospectively collect blood sample Stanford University sample ship UC Davis process interpretation . Patients : 80 patient Stanford evaluate suspicion TIA discharge diagnosis ischemic event : Transient Ischemic Attack Brain Infarction transient minor neurological symptom ( NIHSS≤2 ) . Blood Tests : Genomic analysis : evaluate whole blood genomic profile . Blood collect 3 PAXgene tube ( total 16cc ) . The FDA approve tube contain 7.5 cc preservative stabilize RNA immediately . The tube invert 20 time sit room temperature overnight place -70C freezer process . Those sample send process Professor Frank Sharp 's Lab UC Davis . The RNA process use Affymetrix whole genome array . In addition , blood drawn lavender top tiger top tube , process store Stanford University future research study . Proteomic analyse perform standard serum tube mention . Proteomics analysis process interpreted collaboration Dr. Frank Sharp 's group .</detailed_description>
