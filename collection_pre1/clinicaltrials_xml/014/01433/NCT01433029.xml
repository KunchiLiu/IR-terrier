	<detailed_description>Cardiothoracic Surgeon : If agree take part study , receive DVD contain multiple video different surgeon surgical trainee perform CAB procedure . You train Principal Investigator ( PI ) rate performance surgeon/trainee . You randomly assign 1 2 group : - If Conventional Rater ( CR ) Group , receive conventional training PI rate video . - If Video Rater ( VR ) Group , receive conventional training PI rate video . You also receive video rater train manual . You receive 38 different record procedure study . Each procedure last 15 minute . You record identification code appear begin video , date time view video . You watch video rate performance surgeon/trainee use checklist Global Rating Scale . These rating document give thumb drive either fill computer print fill hand . You give detailed instruction fill checklist rating scale Principal Investigator ( PI ) . Your identity cod blind throughout study . No identify information directly link response . Only video identification number code number use identify assessment data . The code key store separate computer thumb drive . Length Study : You 1 month view rate video . You contact 1 time week PI monitor progress . After watch rat videos , return video , response ( either thumb drive print hard-copies ) , video rater train manual ( VR group ) pre-paid mailer . Up 20 raters may take part study . Cardiothoracic Surgical Trainee : If agree take part study , fill form ask surgical experience . It also ask age , sex , initial , field optional . You use ProXennon Surgical Headlight Camera System ( small camera mount place directly high-intensity light wear head ) record perform CAB procedure . The main principal investigator ( PI ) present system use make sure set properly collect video procedure complete . No audio record . Each video begin dissection coronary artery begin end manipulation anastomosis complete . You record least 6 separate anastomosis , least 2-3 procedure . The time take set-up recording equipment document PI procedure . After procedure , questionnaire complete intra-operative personnel ( nurse , anesthesiologist , perfusionist , operative surgeon , assistant surgeon ) contain question interference record equipment . Neither intra-operative personnel identify questionnaire . The video give code number . The code key keep separately video recording . No identify information directly link video . Only researcher charge access code key . This researcher able link video form fill begin study describe surgical experience . All data present aggregate protect participant identity . Length Study : Your participation study submit last recording This investigational study . The ProXennon Surgical Headlight Camera System approve , standard method record CAB procedure . Up 22 trainee 8 experienced surgeon may take part study .</detailed_description>
