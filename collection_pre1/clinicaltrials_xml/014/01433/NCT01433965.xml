	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether lenalidomide directly inhibit leukemic stem cell vivo use prevent relapse leukemia stem cell transplant . A concern post transplant intervention possibility multiple drug interaction , potential graft versus host disease exacerbation and/or induction cytopenia . Therefore , small dos lenalidomide ( 5 mg ) use set utilized dose level 1 . Starting six month post-transplant , patient begin daily dose lenalidomide . Dependent cohort , patient receive 5 20 mg lenalidomide post transplant . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) determine incidence grade III-IV toxicity organs grade II-IV GVHD . Duration treatment six month .</detailed_description>
