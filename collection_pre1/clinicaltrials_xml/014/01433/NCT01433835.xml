	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ; herpesvirus 5 ) , member betaherpesvirus subgroup , occur benign infection majority human , 90 % prevalence adult population1 . However , CMV infection continue major cause morbidity mortality immunosuppressed patient , particularly recipient solid organ bone marrow transplant . CMV also know association severe blinding retinitis , pneumonia gastrointestinal inflammation AIDS patient . However , successful introduction HAART ( highly active anti-retroviral therapy ) , problem CMV infection AIDS patient decrease substantially . CMV remain important cause congenital viral infection United States , CMV infection neonate associate deafness , mental retardation mortality . In addition , CMV suspect pathogenic agent cardiovascular disease persist large-vessel endothelial cell infect cell type involve cardiovascular lesion . CMV implicate restenosis diseased coronary artery follow angioplasty associate myocarditis . In severely immunocompromised patient CMV infection , prolonged antiviral therapy often necessary , increase risk resistant virus . Currently available therapy limitation preclude long-term use include toxicity , poor oral bioavailability development drug-resistant strain . MBX-400 nucleoside analog structurally related ganciclovir acyclovir develop possible use prevention and/or treatment CMV . MBX-400 , show potent inhibitor viral DNA synthesis therefore may useful treat and/or prevent CMV infection .</detailed_description>
