	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect 4-12 week metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) intervention cell proliferation prostatectomy tissue . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect metformin intervention prostate tissue bioavailability metformin . II . To determine effect metformin intervention apoptosis angiogenesis prostatectomy tissue . III . To determine effect metformin intervention potential molecular target metformin include activate protein kinase ( AMPK ) activation , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) regulation , cell cycle regulation prostatectomy tissue . IV . To determine effect metformin intervention change systemic hormone growth factor show modulated metformin patient population include fast glucose , fast insulin , insulin-like growth factor axis , testosterone , sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) . V. To determine effect metformin intervention change prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive extended-release metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4-12 week . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 4-12 week . Patients arm undergo surgery one day completion treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 30 day surgery .</detailed_description>
