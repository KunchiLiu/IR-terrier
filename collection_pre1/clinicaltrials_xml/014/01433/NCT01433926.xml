	<brief_summary>Main objective : To analyze clinical biological characteristic patient disseminate breast cancer HER2 + treat trastuzumab achieve complete remission , partial stable disease period exceed 3 year . In addition , sub-genetic analysis patient availability sample primary tumor preserve paraffin . This sub-analysis interfere routine clinical practice , tumor sample base hold genetic profile , preserve paraffin extract primary tumor patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Disseminated Her2+ Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Trastuzumab That Have Reached Complete , Partial Remission Stabilization Disease During More Than 3 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To determine frequency patient achieve partial response stable disease period exceed 3 year . - Know time complete partial remission achieve stabilization disease . - Know length complete partial remission time disease stabilization patient . - Knowing pattern treatment achieve complete partial remission stabilization disease duration . - Knowledge overall survival . - Knowing toxicity prolong administration trastuzumab . - Identify primary tumor gene HER-2 associate prolonged response . The source document case clinical history case patient select sub-genetic analysis , report result . The study carry fill notebook electronic data collection gather available information contain medical record . The sub-genetic analysis perform Hospital de la Paz . Both , processing sample conduct analysis use qRT-PCR , performed hospital . All data store , ensure confidentiality , security authenticity .The form must review monitor . Once record data , database revise monitored submit record inconsistencies miss information . Following closure database report present result analysis data .</detailed_description>
