	<brief_summary>Bone fracture traumatic brain-injured spinal cord-injured patient often heal fast patient . However , patient also occasionally prone bone formation soft tissue muscle . This process call heterotopic ossification tend occur around joint . Patients heterotopic ossification often suffer complication nerve compression , ankylosis , chronic pain , osteoporosis , infection . Loss movement also interfere function quality life patient already experience difficulty associate trauma . Positioning , transfer , hygiene become difficult even impossible , worsens loss autonomy . Previous research suggest osteoinductive factor ( capacity induce formation bone ) may release bloodstream follow head spinal cord injury . The investigator laboratory show growth factor call BMP-9 , inject damage mouse muscle , ability cause strong ossification damage muscle . The investigator would like find whether level BMP-9 and/or receptor ( call ALK1 ) increase traumatic brain spinal cord injury occur time serious orthopaedic trauma . The main goal investigator study thus determine whether BMP-9 level increase serum trauma patient .</brief_summary>
