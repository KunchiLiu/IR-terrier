	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy give surgery soft tissue sarcoma decrease size tumor mass presence malignant cell peripheral region . NBTXR3 radiation therapy may kill cancer cell increase tumor shrinkage render surgery feasible easy achieve good local control tumor . PURPOSE : This Phase I trial aim evaluate feasibility NBTXR3 injection tumor , safety adequate dose NBTXR3 give radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NBTXR3 Crystalline Nanoparticles Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Extremity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive single intratumor injection NBTXR3 day 1 receive external beam radiotherapy start day 2 completion 5 week , 5 day week treatment ( 50Gy , 2Gy/fraction ) . Then , patient undergo surgical resection tumor 5 week later follow wound heal toxicity assessment . A visit end treatment take place approximately 3-4 week surgery . Patients follow evaluation disease status adverse event every 8 week end study .</detailed_description>
