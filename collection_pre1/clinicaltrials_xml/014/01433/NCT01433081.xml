	<brief_summary>A national survey reveal 80 % patient experience pain surgery 86 % patient moderate , severe extreme pain ( 1 ) .Postoperative pain extend recovery room stay surgery also common cause unanticipated admission important economic implication ( 2 ) .More importantly , postoperative pain lead poor quality recovery ambulatory patient . The Intraoperative use medication might decrease postoperative pain therefore highly desirable . Some medication lidocaine ketamine prove decrease postoperative pain give Intraoperative period ambulatory patient ( 3,4 ) still unknown medication fact lead good quality recovery . Magnesium sulfate non-competitive calcium antagonist N-methyl-D- aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor ( 5 ) . NMDA receptor important role pain modulation ( 6 ) . The use Intraoperative magnesium order decrease postoperative pain contradictory result different study . Some study show potential benefit magnesium decrease postoperative pain ( 7,8 ) others demonstrate benefit ( 9,10 ) . In ambulatory setting , specifically , Tramer et al . find improvement postoperative pain Intraoperative dose magnesium patient undergoing ilioinguinal hernia repair ( 11 ) . Koinig et al. , however , demonstrate significant reduction postoperative analgesic requirement patient undergo arthroscopic knee surgery ( 12 ) . Even though , reduction postoperative opioid requirement use many study ambulatory literature , recently question investigator ( 13 ) .Patients might take opioid medication may necessarily develop opioid related side effect nausea vomit . A global evaluation patient involve several aspect recovery would significant . The modified quality recovery 40 ( MQOR40 ) validate 40 item instrument assess quality postoperative recovery ( 14 ) . Myles et al . conclude MQOR40 would useful outcome measure assess impact change health care delivery ( 15 ) , anesthesia study underutilize instrument . As complex painful procedure do ambulatory setting , use non-opioid strategy control postoperative pain enhance quality recovery even great role anesthetic management patient . Magnesium establish potential adjuvant ambulatory patient conflict result previous investigator . The main objective study evaluate Intraoperative use magnesium ability improve postoperative quality recovery ambulatory patient .</brief_summary>
