	<criteria>The criterion inclusion propose clinical study follow : 1 . Age : 1860 year age ( inclusive skeletally mature ) ; 2 . A diagnosis symptomatic cervical disc disease , define imageconfirmed pathology : herniated disc , spondylosis , and/or loss disc height . Spondylosis define imageconfirmed disc desiccation , loss disc height , bridge osteophyte , and/or uncovertebral arthrosis . Loss disc height specify measurement least 25 degree less adjacent nonsymptomatic level , minimum 1mm height remain ; 3 . Functional neurological deficit ( i.e. , exhibit least one sign associate cervical level treat , include abnormal reflex , decrease motor strength , abnormal dermatome sensitivity , pain dermatomal distribution ) ; 4 . Symptomatic level C34 , C45 , C56 C67 ( one level ) ; 5 . Preoperative Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) great 30 point ( consider moderate disability ; Vernon 1991 ) ; 6 . Unresponsive conservative treatment 6 week , and/or exhibit progressive symptom and/or sign nerve root and/or spinal cord compression face conservative treatment ; 7 . Not pregnant , interested become pregnant within followup period study ; 8 . Willing able comply requirement define protocol duration study ; 9 . Signed date Informed Consent . Patients follow characteristic eligible entry propose study : 1 . Prior cervical fusion , prior laminectomy ( prior cervical laminotomy violate facet need exclude ) , and/or prior cervical facetectomy operative level ; 2 . Requiring surgical treatment would leave patient postoperative deficiency posterior element ; 3 . Signal change cord preoperative T2weighted MRI and/or clinically significant myelopathy would describe gait disturbance , loss manual dexterity , bowel bladder incontinence/retention . 4 . Radiographic sign significant instability operative level ( great 3mm translation , great 11 degree rotation different adjacent level ) ; 5 . Bridging osteophyte motion &lt; 3 degree ; 6 . Radiographic confirmation significant facet joint disease degeneration ; 7 . Chronic neck arm pain unknown etiology ; 8 . Cervical fracture , anatomic anomaly , deformity ( e.g . ankylose spondylitis , scoliosis ) level prosthesis attach ; 9 . Severe spondylolisthesis ( great grade 1 ) ; 10 . Endocrine disorder connective tissue disease ; 11 . Rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease ; 12 . Progressive neuromuscular disease , e.g. , muscular dystrophy , multiple sclerosis ; 13 . Chronic steroid user ; 14 . Taking medication drug dos know potentially interfere bone metabolism soft tissue healing , may include ( limited ) follow : inhaled glucocorticoid asthma , corticosteroid , thyroid hormone , blood thinner ( heparin , warfarin ) , gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist prostate cancer treatment , contraceptive medroxyprogesterone , lithium bipolar disorder treatment , anticonvulsant , aluminumcontaining antacid , tetracycline ; 15 . Osteoporosis degree spinal instrumentation would contraindicate ( DEXA Tscore less equal 2.5 ; DEXA necessary patient exhibit risk factor low bone mass quantify DEXA screen questionnaire ) ; 16 . Diabetes mellitus require insulin management ; 17 . Presence metastasis active spinal tumor malignancy ; 18 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 40 ; 19 . Active local systemic infection , include AIDS , hepatitis ; 20 . Having enrol another investigational device study within last 90 day ; 21 . Having another cervical device implant would interfere surgical approach , study control device , followup evaluation ; 22 . Demonstrates 3 sign nonorganic behavior , Waddell 's sign ; 23 . History substance abuse ; 24 . Involved spinal litigation ; 25 . Mentally incompetent ; 26 . Incarcerated .</criteria>
