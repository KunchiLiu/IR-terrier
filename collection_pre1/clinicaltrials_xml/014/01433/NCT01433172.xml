	<brief_title>Combination Immunotherapy GM.CD40L Vaccine With CCL21 Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine make mix two kind cell : 1 ) lung cancer cell , grown lab , 2 ) experimental `` bystander ( present take part immune response ) '' cell . All cell vaccine treat high-dose X-rays make sure none grow cause cancer . The bystander cell human cell genetically change express GM-CSF CD40L . These call `` GM.CD40L '' . ( That original cell , call K562 , gene human GM-CSF CD40L insert ) . These change design help boost participant ' immune system well fight cancer body . GM-CSF hormone know stimulate bone marrow make white blood cell . CCL21 chemokine ( protein ) help recruit T cell ( type white blood cell help protect body infection ) lead hyper-responsive T cell . This lead heighten immune response T cell expose CCL21 antigen ( substance introduce body lead production antibody ) -presenting cell ( A cell `` present '' antigen form T cell recognize ) . The induction strong cell-mediated immune response type immunity expect involved control cancer cell growth . A randomized trial vaccine consist GM.CD40L bystander cell equivalent number allogeneic ( take different individual ) tumor cell plus minus CCL21 propose .</detailed_description>

Measurable metastatic tumor define standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . Lesions must accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20 mm . With spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan , lesion must ≥10 mm least one dimension . Symptomatic brain metastasis Uncontrolled central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis permit . Any acute medical problem require active intervention Current corticosteroid ( replacement dose patient hypoadrenal ) immunosuppressive therapy Any preexisting immunodeficiency condition ( include know human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] infection ) Any know preexisting autoimmune disorder History second malignancy within previous 2 year ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical insitu ) Patients major surgery without full recovery major surgery within three week start vaccine treatment Pregnant lactate woman : Patients reproductive age must agree use contraceptive method duration study ( *A pregnancy test obtain treatment ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 2 , 3 , 4 Patients significant disease disorder , Investigator 's opinion , would exclude study . Patients discretion investigator deem rapidly progressive disease</criteria>
