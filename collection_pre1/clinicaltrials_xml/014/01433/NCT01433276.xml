	<brief_summary>Indication : Resuscitation pt hemorrhagic shock due multiple injury Prospective , open label RCT pt . traumatic hemorrhagic shock RS Hasan Sadikin Hospital , Indonesia . PI : Dr. Kiki Lukman , PsBD ( K ) , Surgery , RSHS . Co-PI : ( late ) Prof. Xavier Leverve MD , PhD , Directeur , INSERM-E0221-Bioenergetique Fondamentale et Appliquée Université Joseph Fourier , France Hemorrhagic shock cause death trauma.Fluid resuscitation ensure stable hemodynamics microcirculation rapidly restore circulate plasma volume could cornerstone manage trauma patient . Excessive fluid accumulation particularly interstitial tissue avoid . Hypertonic solution show promise restore intravascular volume expansion microcirculation less fluid infusion hypovolemic patient . This study investigate efficacy safety hyperosmolar Na lactate ( Totilac® ) resuscitate traumatic hemorrhagic shock patient . Patients multiple injury grade III hemorrhagic shock RTS ≥4 receive std initial fluid resuscitation upto 2 liter isotonic crystalloid . They also get similar dose either hyperosmolar Na lactate ringer 's lactate . Hemodynamic status , fluid balance safety record study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trauma still important cause death disability worldwide.Trauma patient often experience fluid deficit . In addition apparent blood loss , fluid deficit might also occur secondary generalized alteration endothelial barrier , result diffuse capillary leakage fluid shift intravascular interstitial compartment . Severe volume deficit trauma result hemorrhagic shock lead decrease tissue perfusion , especially vital organ inadequate delivery oxygen nutrient necessary normal tissue cellular function . Subsequently , inadequate inappropriate management hemorrhagic shock frequently result development post trauma multiple organ failure increase morbidity mortality patient . Consequences hypovolemic shock ( hemorrhagic shock ) due bleed one major cause death trauma patient . Therefore , fluid replacement reverse shock restore perfusion vital organ appear fundamental management trauma patient , ensure adequate airway , oxygenation ventilation . Effective control hemorrhage adequate intravenous fluid administration restore intravascular volume maintain tissue perfusion crucial save patient 's life resuscitation exacerbate cellular injury cause hemorrhagic shock , resuscitation perform properly . The type fluid use resuscitation play important role injury pattern . However , , fluid ideal regard fluid resuscitation remain controversial . The concept early , aggressive large - volume resuscitation administration isotonic crystalloids volume 2 3 time estimate blood loss widely accept practice ; even become standard-of-care adopted ATLS treatment trauma casualty ( ATLS congress ) . In patient prolonged hemorrhagic shock frequently associate interstitial fluid deficit addition intravascular blood volume , resuscitation fluid need replace intravascular volume loss replenish interstitial deficit . It suggest aggressive fluid resuscitation improve survival good function patient 's vital organ patient 's less frequent renal failure . However , aggressive fluid resuscitation lead fulminant pulmonary failure `` Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) '' appear early cause death severe hemorrhage . Moreover , observe aggressive fluid resuscitation uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock attempt increase blood pressure normal result increased bleeding injured vessel , hemodynamic decompensation , increased mortality , lead cellular injury compare fluid resuscitation hypotensive resuscitation ( permissive hypotension ) . Therefore novel resuscitation strategy overcome issue near future still require . Hyperosmolar solution various concentration ( 1.8 % -7.5 % ) investigate resuscitation solution vitro , well animal clinical study , promise result . Clinical experimental study demonstrate small volume hypertonic saline solution able restore hemodynamics traumatic shock patient . Small volume hypertonic solution stabilize arterial pressure cardiac output , improve microvascular flow ( increase renal , mesenteric , total splanchic coronary blood flow ) , control intracranial pressure , deleterious effect immune function . Moreover , hemorrhagic shock model , Hyperosmolar solution immunomodulatory effect include attenuation immune-mediated cellular injury , modulate post-trauma immune response , decrease neutrophil excitation , decrease inflammation , neutrophil-endothelial binding , lung damage , bowel injury . This hypertonic solution effective isotonic crystalloids minimize inflammatory response ( especially neutrophil cyto-toxicity ) prevent lung liver reperfusion injury , well improve intestinal blood flow . Improved survival rate traumatic hemorrhagic shock patient treat hypertonic solution report several trial . The beneficial effect hypertonic saline show related hypertonicity characteristic . A proprietary solution contain hyperosmolar sodium lactate ( Totilac ) hyperosmolar solution physiological concentration potassium chloride calcium chloride . Totilac small volume administration volume deficit post cardiac surgery patient improve cardiac output , oxygen delivery , urine output , attenuate metabolic acidosis maintain stable hemodynamic good compare isotonic crystalloid . Administration small dose Totilac patient dengue shock syndrome also improve hemodynamic status microcirculation . High lactate content solution offer benefit shock patient compare hypertonic solution lactate know act energy substrate mitochondrion contain cell easily metabolize hypoxia . Hypertonicity related effect hyperosmolar sodium lactate solution addition lactate effect may offer least similar benefit hemorrhagic shock patient , though clinical study conduct prove efficacy Totilac hemorrhagic shock . This study aim evaluate efficacy safety Totilac resuscitative fluid regimen traumatic shock hemorrhagic patient .</detailed_description>
