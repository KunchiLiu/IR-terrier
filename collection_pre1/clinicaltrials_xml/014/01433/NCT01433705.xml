	<brief_summary>Establish normal distribution Rb-82 , N-13 ammonia , F-18 FDG ( radioactively label tracer ) heart use PET image subsequent use evaluation clinical patient study use procedure . Normal healthy volunteer extensively screen study . Subjects give IV administration Rb-82 N-13 acquire rest/stress image . Normal subject exclude unexpected abnormality Rb-82 N-13 rest/stress study undergo glucose load F-18 FDG image protocol , viability protocol use hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp simultaneous IV infusion dextrose insulin accord standard procedure laboratory . These individual also undergo inflammation F-18 FDG protocol follow high fat , protein permit , carbohydrate diet approximately 30 hour prior F-18 FDG injection . The F-18 FDG radiotracer administer IV per protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac rubidium-82 ( Rb-82 ) N-13 ammonia heart perfusion ( blood flow ) study florine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-18FDG ) heart PET glucose metabolism study important tool evaluation patient coronary heart disease . This include patient know suspected heart disease patient congestive heart failure follow myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) indeterminant assessment cardiac health image modality , example SPECT perfusion image echocardiography . These study help physician plan potentially life save procedure re-establish coronary blood flow live severly compromise heart muscle . Rb-82 N-13 ammonia study tell reduce blood flow heart muscle either rest stress . FDG study tell whether chance beneficial effect coronary revascularization procedure , example coronary angioplasty stent coronary artery bypass . Revascularization procedures patient like may technically difficult , risky costly . Unfortunately normal cardiac distribution Rb-82 , N-13 ammonia , F-18FDG computer analysis human study well know know widely available clinical use . The late imaging guideline American Society Nuclear Cardiology recommend Rb-82 , N-13 ammonia , FDG cardiac study compare normal distribution pattern radiotracers heart develop series normal individual . The purpose study generate database normal Rb-82 , N-13 ammonia , F-18FDG cardiac distribution use analysis clinical patient study University Michigan Hospital .</detailed_description>
