	<brief_title>Mucosal Immunity Ulcerative Colitis Patients Undergoing Therapy With Trichuris Suis Ova</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept helminthic therapy ( use worm treat disease ) support experiment mouse model well several clinical study . TSO , purify eggs porcine whipworm Trichuris suis , investigated clinical trial potential therapeutic agent treatment active Crohn 's disease , relapse multiple sclerosis , peanut tree nut allergy , adult autistic disorder . The goal study understand immune mechanism activate human gastrointestinal tract treatment TSO , may lead improvement symptoms ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . TSO show clinical benefit subset patient UC previous randomize placebo-controlled trial ( Summers et al . 2005 ) . However , mechanisms action TSO intestinal mucosa remain unclear . We propose exploratory 24-week mechanistic randomize double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study TSO patient establish active UC good characterize similarity differences immune mechanism intestinal mucosa response TSO . We hypothesize treatment TSO lead anti-inflammatory immune response individual UC increase intestinal mucus production modulation Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , T-regulatory effector lymphocyte population .</detailed_description>
