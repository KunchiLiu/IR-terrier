	<brief_summary>Tetra-ataxiametric posturography base measurement computerized elaboration electronic signal emit four footplate , one heel toe , respectively . These sensitive vertical pressure produce subject stand straight various position ( foot parallel , tandem , eye close , pad , etc. ) . The method yield additional parameter obtain traditional monoplate stabilometers , namely , weight-distribution pattern correlation among six combination pair output two heel , two toe , heel/toe foot , two diagonal ( tetra-ataxiametric synchronization ) . Most athletic injury occur end activity , participant fatigue . It likely significant portion injury result instability low extremity joint consequence fatigue stabilize muscle . Muscle fatigue increase postural sway , impaired muscle control , increase onset delay movement . Comparing pre-exercise post-exercise result athlete , detect significant clinically meaningful difference Tetra-ataxiametric measure stability , interaction Fourier Spectral Power Ranges body sway , weight distribution , synchronization toe part . The method suitable young subject , equipment portable test conveniently carry child 's familiar training set right before/after exercise . The goal present study measure balance athlete different type exercise , measure ability athletes recover different type exercise , measure influence increase physical fitness balance ability . Fifty basketball football player age 12 18 year old examine follow informed consent child legal guardian . Each participant would measure three time year ( pre-season , middle-season , post-season ) , three time ( before-training , aerobic warming-up , after-training ) Tetrax . Additionally , physical parameter ( height , weight ) , anatomical parameter ( leg length ) , joint range movement , would record .</brief_summary>
