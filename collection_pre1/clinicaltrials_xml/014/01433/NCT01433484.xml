	<brief_summary>This study aim reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk disparity risk improve lifestyle factor underlie development CVD . The first step involve conduct comprehensive formative evaluation ass individual , interpersonal , organizational , community , policy factor relevant CVD risk risk reduction Lenoir County . This follow community-based lifestyle intervention program design improve eating pattern , promote physical activity , interested , support weight loss . A randomized trial compare effectiveness two community base weight maintenance intervention also conduct . Community-wide policy environmental change intervention also implement support individual-level intervention , include partnership business promote healthy environment innovative economic opportunity . In addition , project explore genetic factor associate cardiovascular disease risk treatment success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The lifestyle intervention enroll 350 participant . The initial lifestyle component study , last 4-6 month , provide participant . Participants may choose one two intervention format , 4 contact : individual counseling least one face-to-face visit rest face-to-face phone 4 group session . The dietary intervention focus improve fat carbohydrate quality . For fat intake , goal include 2-4 serving per day polyunsaturated fat primarily plant source minimal intake trans fat . For carbohydrate intake , goal include increase intake whole grain , fruit vegetable , bean reduce consumption refine carbohydrate . The physical activity intervention primarily focus walk goal 7500 10,000 step per day , wish use pedometer , 30 minute walk day . Muscle strengthen activity also recommend . At 4-6 month follow-up measure , wish take part weight loss study may continue maintenance lifestyle intervention . The investigator anticipate approximately 200 participant take part weight loss component study , consist 6 month intensive weight loss intervention . Participants may choose two intervention format : 16 weekly group session 5 group session 10 phone counseling session . The weight loss goal 5 % body weight . At conclusion program , lose least 8 pound willing take part 1 year maintenance weight loss intervention RANDOMIZED one two maintenance weight loss program . One maintenance arm receive monthly telephone contact one year , arm receive bi-monthly phone contact . Follow-up measure participant approximately 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Another related part project use system approach develop model integrate clinical genomic data . Researchers develop test approach refer SAMARA ( Supporting A Multidisciplinary Approach Research Atherosclerosis ) Project apply recent , major advance biomedical computational science UNC develop deep understand human CVD . The Heart-Healthy Lenoir Project expand study community , use methodology : 1 ) determine prevalence genomic risk signature high-risk community population use genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis ; 2 ) develop novel genomic model incorporate high-risk feature population ; 3 ) determine whether genomic signature use predict responsiveness intervention underlie CVD disparity . Participants consent component project blood specimen obtain baseline .</detailed_description>
