	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) tear disable injury place significant burden athlete . Roughly 80 % injury link noncontact mechanism , 70 % occur landing jump . Female athletes high risk sustain noncontact ACL injury due high number risk factor possess compare male counterpart . Due statistic , ACL prevention program develop past 15 year attempt reduce risk among female athletic population . These program show reduce rate noncontact ACL injury females correct risk factor associate . However , remain unclear whether positive result solely due program high exercise workload participant . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness ACL prevention program modify at-risk landing mechanic ( associate noncontact ACL injury ) compare resistance train program equal workload .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injury Background Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) tear disable injury place significant burden athlete . The average cost ACL reconstruction estimate approximately $ 17,000 per patient full recovery commonly take around 6 month achieve . It estimate 1 every 3000 people United States suffer ACL rupture year . Roughly 80 % injury link noncontact mechanism , 70 % occur landing jump . Injury Mechanism Upon landing , low body fall refer `` position-of-no-return '' ( PNR ) . The landing kinematics involve PNR place high amount stress ACL ultimately lead complete rupture . Injury Imbalance Female athletes participate sport involve jump cut activity suffer 4-to-6 time ACL injury males participate sport . This attribute high number risk factor females possess puberty . In particular , upon maturation , male exhibit neuromuscular spurt , increase power , strength , coordination , whereas female . Other risk factor females demonstrate quadriceps dominance ligament dominance . Both dominance link land kinematics knee place PNR . Quadriceps dominance characterize extended knee posture display PNR land jump . When land extend knee , tibia translate anteriorly femur , cause ACL become taunt . In order prevent ACL rupturing , hamstring must activate flex knee translate tibia posteriorly . In response anterior tibial translation , females find utilize different muscle recruitment pattern male contract quadriceps hamstring , whereas male follow opposite pattern . By contract quadriceps first , hamstring overpower , allow anterior tibial translation occur land . Ligament dominance evidence increase knee valgus display PNR land cut . During maneuver , female rely knee ligament rather low extremity musculature absorb ground reaction force . This tendency place high amount stress ACL , turn , increase probability rupture . Injury Prevention Due high rate noncontact ACL injury see female athlete , neuromuscular training ( NMT ) program develop attempt prevent reduce risk injury . These program administer either off-season regimen in-season warm-up routine , incorporate combination plyometric , proprioceptive , strength training exercise , particular focus place correct technique . By modify neuromuscular risk factor , NMT program able significantly reduce rate noncontact ACL injury . Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate effectiveness ACL prevention program modify at-risk landing mechanic ( associate noncontact ACL injury ) compare resistance train program equal workload . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate effectiveness ACL prevention program improve max vertical jump height compare resistance train program equal workload .</detailed_description>
