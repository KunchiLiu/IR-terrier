	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , Phase 1b/2 study conduct two part : Phase 1b part comprise dose escalation expansion cohort ; Phase 2 part comprise two cohort . The purpose Phase 1b part identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) E7050 E7080 ( lenvatinib ) combination subject unresectable advanced metastatic solid tumor . In subsequent Phase 1b expansion cohort Phase 2 cohort , additional subject recurrent glioblastoma unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma disease progression prior systemic treatment enrol confirm MTD ( expansion cohort ) explore clinical activity E7050 lenvatinib .</brief_summary>
