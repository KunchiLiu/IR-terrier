	<brief_summary>Background : Increased access antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) Africa require decentralization primary health care . For purpose , adapt method management patient co-infected tuberculosis ( TB ) HIV need . Improved detection TB patient start ART , assessment co-administration ART TB treatment priority field . Aims : To identify clinical predictor TB patient start ART , construct screen algorithms TB population ; assess ART outcomes patient receive TB treatment health centre level . Work plan : The project perform health centre provide ART Ethiopia . A cohort HIV positive patient initiate ART prospectively follow . Baseline characteristic register ; blood sample CD4 cell , HIV RNA immunological marker collect , well sputum TB culture PCR . During ART , clinical data , CD4 cell count HIV RNA level follow . Patients TB compare without TB regard ART outcome . Baseline factor associate TB use construct TB screening algorithm . Recruitment cohort complete March 2013 ; follow-up determination long term outcome ART continue 2016 . Significance : These study give insight TB-HIV co-infection primary health care level Sub-Saharan region , may impact future guideline management patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Tuberculosis HIV-infected Patients Eligible Antiretroviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain leading opportunistic infection cause death among HIV-infected subject resource-limited setting ( 1 ) . HIV infection strong risk factor know develop active TB , consequence , HIV epidemic Sub-Saharan Africa fuel incidence TB ( 2 ) . The interaction HIV TB great challenge health care , regard diagnosis treatment . In HIV-infected person TB often atypical manifestation , make correct timely diagnosis difficult ( 3 , 4 ) . Recognition TB start antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) critical since miss diagnosis TB associate high early mortality ART initiation ( 1 , 5 ) . Screening TB recommend HIV-positive subject , method satisfactory specificity sensitivity use primary health care setting Africa yet identify . New diagnostic technique TB recently develop , GenXpert PCR ( 6 ) , optimal use alternative method need investigate . In setting TB HIV infection common , high proportion patient need anti-tuberculosis treatment ( ATT ) ART . Combined ART ATT associate risk drug interaction , overlap side effect , immune reconstitution disease poor adherence , least patient severe immunodeficiency , risk outweigh decreased mortality ( 7-9 ) . Studies perform developed country show rate virological suppression ART patient receive concomitant ATT comparable person take ATT ( 10 , 11 ) , topic extensively investigated primary health care level Africa . The number HIV-infected subject receive ART Sub-Saharan Africa increase dramatically last year . Still , estimate less half patient need ART currently receive treatment ( 12 ) . In order improve access , become necessary decentralize ART integrate treatment primary health care system . Since many patient start ART unrecognized active TB time point , important find practical reliable screen algorithm TB among individual . Furthermore , outcome combine ATT ART deliver health centre must assess , especially regard HIV RNA suppression selection ART resistance . This project aim develop algorithm potential identify indicator prevalent incident TB among patient initiate ART correlate baseline clinical sign symptom result culture- PCR-based investigation TB . Such clinical characteristic compare TB present start ART , well TB present first year ART initiation . Results comparison use construct algorithm TB screen Ethiopian patient eligible ART . In addition , clinical , immunological virological outcome ART patient concomitant ATT compare patient receive ART . Specific aim study rate virological suppression ART , development antiretroviral drug resistance , treatment adherence . Work plan : HIV-infected adult patient eligible start ART recruit HIV clinic several health centre provide integrated HIV TB Oromia region . 812 patient prospectively include cohort , continue follow-up . At baseline , detailed demographic , socio-economic clinical data ( presence general respiratory symptom , body mass index , mid-upper arm circumference various finding physical examination ) collect , include information current medical traditional therapy . Blood CD4 cell count , complete blood count HIV RNA obtain . In addition , plasma , stool urine sample analysis immunological inflammatory marker , potential new biomarkers active TB infection , collect store -80 -20 Â° C. Participants undergone sample microbiological investigation TB start ART . All patient submit two sputum sample TB microscopy , culture PCR . From patient peripheral lymphadenopathy , lymph node aspiration microbiological test do . PCR perform use GeneXpert technique . The study protocol include definition TB base microbiological result clinical data accord WHO guideline . Results TB culture await ART initiation . Patients TB diagnosed receive ATT soon diagnosis establish . For patient start ART time point , recommendation continue ART ; however , responsible clinician may decide interrupt ART medically indicate . Follow : Participants follow 48 month ( monthly first 3 month , subsequently every 3 month first year study every 6 month ) . On follow-up visit , clinical adherence data collect . Incidence death , hospitalization , TB opportunistic infection , sign immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) , default treatment interruption follow continuously , trace defaulter ascertain rate mortality . Blood CD4 cell count HIV RNA obtain 1 month start ART 3-monthly interval first 6 month study inclusion ( 6-monthly interval onwards ) . Samples obtain 6 month start ART detectable HIV RNA subject genotypic test detect drug resistance mutation . In addition , blood sample analysis immunological marker obtain 1 , 3 , 6 12 month ART . Urine sample analyze presence lipoarabinomannane use lateral flow assay . Data analysis : Patient characteristic correlate prevalent TB baseline , identify indicator TB . These result use construct screen algorithms validate sensitivity , specificity predictive accuracy . Baseline predictor incident TB ART also investigate . For assessment ART outcome , patient categorize accord baseline TB status . Participants take ATT compare control take ART . Incidence time define event study use survival curve ( mortality , disease progression , HIV RNA suppression , loss follow-up ) . HIV RNA CD4 cell level ART , treatment interruption , adherence , new opportunistic infection , drug side effect TB IRIS compare group . Predictors death ART failure assess . Significance : Improving management patient co-infected TB HIV highly endemic region critical success continue scale ART . Initiating ART ATT challenge exist condition Sub-Saharan Africa , majority patient diagnose treat . Case detection rate TB remain estimate Ethiopia . Active TB frequently miss patient eligible ART , phenomenon likely important mortality medical complication follow ART initiation . A screen algorithm base clinical data adequate predictive accuracy could help identify TB population , lead improve treatment outcome TB HIV infection . Increased detection timely treatment TB HIV-infected subject would also reduce transmission society . The outcome combine ATT ART administer health centre must assess , especially concern development drug resistance serious consequence infect individual community . Results study could inform health authority efficacy feasibility combine therapy , important future HIV/TB policy Ethiopia Sub-Saharan country . The project receive ethical clearance Lund University , Sweden , Institute Science Technology , Ethiopia .</detailed_description>
