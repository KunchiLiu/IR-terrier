	<detailed_description>Aim To study impact patient support selective drug pressure , define semi-quantitative assessment adherence , viral suppression resistance development randomise control trial HIV positive patient randomise enhanced treatment support ( ETS ) self supervise treatment ( SST ) . Specific Objectives 1 . To create study population 600 HIV+ patient CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 200/ul randomize two different treatment cohort , enhance treatment support ( ETS ) conventional self-supervised treatment ( SST ) . 2 . To monitor patient use semi-quantitative assessment adherence , clinical status include clinical examination ( every 3 month ) , viral load CD4+ T-cell count ( every 6 month ) 24 month virological treatment failure primary endpoint . 3 . To compare ETS SST cohort respect primary endpoint , virological treatment failure , relation semi-quantitative assessment adherence analyse mechanism selective drug pressure development resistance include resistance minor viral subpopulation . 4 . To conduct cost effectiveness assessment compare ETS SST respect labour infrastructural cost , virological treatment failure change second line therapy . The study conduct Quang Ninh Province , area hard hit HIV epidemic Vietnam know HIV+ prevalence 1 % . A study population 600 HIV+ patient CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 200 recruit four district , Ha Long , Uong Bi , Yen Huong Dong Trieu . Each HIV+ person examine accord WHO guideline . HIV+ person receive complete physical examination , clinical stag HIV infection , opportunistic infection include HBV , HCV tuberculosis . Laboratory test include Full blood count , CD4+ T-cell count , viral load use affordable simple ELISA base ExaVirR viral load test ( http : //www.cavidi.se ) , liver enzymes , PAP smear pregnancy test woman . If indicate ( e.g . prolonged cough ) chest X-ray , sputum microscopy AFB do . Opportunistic infection HIV+ patient treat accord national guideline . HIV+ person receive counsel include information disease plan care treatment , follow-up visit , nutrition living , prevention HIV transmission include safe sex , harm reduction measure , use birth control method prevention mother child HIV transmission . Inclusion exclusion criterion 's described . The patient randomise two equally large cohort , receive either two different treatment strategy ) enhance treatment support ( ETS ) ( describe ) Self-supervised treatment ( SST ) . Co-infections assess , diagnose treatment adjust accord national guideline situation . The patient study respect : ( ) virological treatment failure , ( ii ) adverse effect . ( iii ) patient 's adherence treatment strategy . First drug regimen patient include stavudine , lamivudine , nevirapine efavirenz dosage , follow adverse effect regimen alteration do accord national guideline . The health care worker train regular monitoring patient implementation optimal treatment strategy . All procedure treatment follow national guideline . Follow consultation include physical examination test do every 3 month . The test include full blood count , CRP , electrolytes , liver enzymes well indicate . Viral load monitor every 6 month CD4+ T-cell count every 12 month . The number patient need arm experiment estimate assume difference arm 15 percent unit treatment failure correspond baseline percentage 20 % . Requiring power 80 % significance level 5 % necessary number 300 per arm . Inflating size 30 % compensate expect loss follow investigator get 300 patient per arm . The assumption difference base follow : ) Differences large 10 % unit virological treatment failure indication review modification treatment strategy ; b ) group differences virological treatment failure le 20 % unlikely lead policy change Vietnam . The discussion use binary variable like failure/no failure . Performing analysis quantitative variable like CD4 T-cell reading , informative , case considerably high power correspond binary . In ETS strategy `` internal supporter '' , family member person trust patient , train fill checklist whether drug take observed . An '' external supporter '' - peer select PLWHA visit patient twice weekly first two month . The external supporter follow checklist ask general well , psychological problem adverse drug reaction well go adherence since last visit , use internal supporter checklist . If adherence good , number visit decrease weekly two month , , number visit intensify . If symptoms opportunistic infection , immunological reconstruction syndrome adverse drug reaction patient refer medical checkup.. In SST patient self responsible take drug . At initiation treatment counseling provide . In group drug provide pre-packed dosage form easy remember counting pill . The patient follow 24 month monitor clinical examination ( 3 month ) , viral load plasma ( six month ) , CD4- T-cell count ( 6 month ) assessment well-being ( every 3 month ) . Adherence among patient assess use Contextualised Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( AACTG ) Adherence Instruments ( Chesney et al , 2000 ) . AACTG Adherence Instruments consist two questionnaire first questionnaire specifically develop use baseline assessment adherence . The second questionnaire version develop assessment adherence follow-up visit . Adherence assess use AACTG Adherence Instruments every third month ETS SST group . One person present clinic answer question regard questionnaire provide help necessary . Adherence also measure pill count conduct External supporter , enable calculation proportion drug remain total amount prescribe drug . Assessment side effect accord WHO suggest monitoring management ARV drug do together clinical examination three month . The primary endpoint virological treatment failure define viral load 1 fg reverse transcriptase activity/ml , correspond 200 copies/ml , 1 year 2 year start treatment . Drug Resistance determine use selective real-time PCR detection critical mutation RT-gene , marker whether virological treatment failure occur wild-type virus resistant virus . The secondary endpoint immunological treatment failure ( rise CD4+ T-cell count 1 year ) clinical treatment failure define new AIDS defining illness death due HIV/AIDS ( include TB opportunistic infection ) start treatment . Costing two different strategy carry collect monetary data expense drug , test , allowance expense perspective HIV/AIDS treatment provider ART . The investigator follow basic principle activity-based cost identifying activity necessary provide EST SST calculate cost carry activity . Costs activity comprise recurrent capital cost , direct indirect cost . Recurrent cost routine cost resource consume within year , i.e. , non-capital item labor medical supply . Capital cost represent annual portion cost durable HIV Sida DOTARV asset . Effectiveness measure percentage patient virological treatment failure define Viral Load &gt; 400 copies/ml . The statistical analysis mainly consist comparison two group respect define primary endpoint , virological treatment failure , possibly secondary endpoint immunological treatment failure clinical treatment failure , relation semi-quantitative assessment adherence . Basically standard statistical method use . Regression model outcome dependent variable group indicator together person characteristic independent variable main approach . For binary outcome , logistic regression use . Attention pay particular , often skew , distribution variable like CD4+ T-cell count viral load . Transformations use non-parametric approach likely necessary measure dichotomise use linear regression . The correlation drug resistance use drug ( stavudine , lamivudine , nevirapine ) adherence statistically analyse order study whether basic mechanism selective drug pressure result concave bell-shaped resistance - adherence relationship , drug ETS SST low-income setting . The investigator strictly comply widely recognize international text code practice include Helsinki agreement . In project one patient cohort receive ETS SST . Both OTC SST cohort encourage proceed regularly drug treatment present difficulty may encounter . For project period , project meet cost ARV cohort . Patients ' biological sample collect used write consent . All specimen cod protect identity patient ensure confidentiality . Patients recruit consecutive manner without regard race exclusion consideration . Confidentiality assure use code patient identification , confidentially law strictly observe process human clinical information . No patient identify information publish available requisite clinical data collect , consent obtain use data tissue . Data accessible member coordinator tissue procurement facility research team , approve guideline .</detailed_description>
