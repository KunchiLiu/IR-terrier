	<brief_summary>This study Phase I/II open label , multi-centre trial . Patients HER2+ve metastatic breast cancer , follow disease progression , , treatment trastuzumab taxanes , treat Lapatinib ( Tyverb™ 500-1250 mg orally daily - depend maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine Phase I part study ) plus Myocet™ , 50-60 mg/m2 i.v q3 week ) . Within Phase I part , dos assign registration accord dose escalation scheme . The dose Phase II part trial base MTD establish Phase I part study . Clinical laboratory parameter assess evaluate disease response toxicity study therapy . Safety assessment perform every 3 week first 24 week . Efficacy assessment ( radiological examination ) perform patient every 8 week ( ± 7 day ) first 24 week . Cardiotoxicity assessment perform week 6 12 . From week 24 , safety , efficacy cardiotoxicity assessment perform every 12 week end treatment ( disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient withdraws consent ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 . To determine optimal dose lapatinib plus Myocet™ , combination , patient HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer follow disease progression , , treatment trastuzumab taxanes ( Phase I ) . 2 . To evaluate 6 month progression-free survival patient HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer , follow disease progression , , treatment trastuzumab taxanes , treat lapatinib plus Myocet™ ( Phase II plus patient treat MTD Phase I ) . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate overall survival time , duration progression -free survival , time treatment failure , confirm tumour response rate duration response patient treat regimen ( Phase II plus patient treat MTD Phase I ) . 2 . To assess safety tolerability regimen patient . 3 . To assess incidence cardiotoxicity patient treat regimen .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential use effective contraceptive ( non hormonal intra uterine device ( IUD ) , condom , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner ) .during treatment 6 month follow discontinuation therapy . 3 . Histologically confirm metastatic breast cancer 4 . Documented HER2 overexpression ( IHC 3+ FISH CISH positive ) 5 . At least one measurable lesion accord RECIST criterion . Patients bone disease eligible . 6 . Patients control brain metastasis eligible . 7 . Documented disease progression . Progression entry define appearance new lesion previously identify increase 25 % existent lesion previous CT scan must document 8 . Prior treatment must contain trastuzumab taxane . Patients may treat Lapatinib previously . 9 . Life expectancy least 12 week 10 . ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 11 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 55 % , measure Echocardiogram MUGA Scan ( within 14 day prior first infusion ) , document history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmias congestive heart failure within previous 6 month 12 . Adequate bone marrow , haematological , hepatic renal function define : Absolute Neutrophils Count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet Count ≥ 100 x 109/L Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ ULN . Patients Gilbert 's syndrome prior study entry must total bilirubin &lt; 3 x ULN . Alkaline Phosphatase AST ALT within parameter specify protocol 13 . Patients must recover clinically significant side effect associate prior radiotherapy chemotherapy 14 . Able swallow retain oral medication . 15 . Formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue archive tumour tissue sample available ( primary metastatic tissue . Patients meet follow exclusion criterion eligible enrolment study : 1 . Pregnant lactate woman 2 . Prior anthracycline chemotherapy lifetime dose exceed 360 mg/m2 doxorubicin 550 mg/m2 epirubicin 3 . Documented history poorly control hypertension ) , arrhythmia , clinically significant valvular disease , angina require treatment , transmural infarction , myocardial infarction within previous 6 month 4 . Concurrent disease would make patient inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere patient 's safety 5 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would interfere patient 's safety inform consent 6 . Active uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection . 7 . History malignancy . However patient disease free 5 year , patient history resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ cancer eligible 8 . Concurrent cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , within 4 week precede first dose investigational product ) 9 . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational product 10 . Concurrent treatment investigational drug within 4 week precede first dose investigational product 11 . Known hypersensitivity lapatinib Myocet™ excipients 12 . Any contraindication lapatinib Myocet™ 13 . Receive concurrent treatment prohibit medication . Zometa patient bone metastasis allow . If patient Zometa start study , continue throughout duration study .</criteria>
