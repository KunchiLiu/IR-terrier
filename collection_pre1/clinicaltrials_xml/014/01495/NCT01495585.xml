	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis D severe disease liver cause infection hepatitis D virus . The hepatitis D virus infect person also hepatitis B ; therefore , people delta hepatitis hepatitis B hepatitis D virus infection . Most people hepatitis D eventually develop cirrhosis , cause scar damage liver . There currently effective treatment chronic hepatitis D. - Lonafarnib drug originally design treat different type cancer . It may able prevent hepatitis D virus reproduce . However , test people hepatitis D. Researchers want study different dos lonafarnib see affect virus level symptoms hepatitis D. Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness lonafarnib treatment chronic hepatitis D. Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age chronic hepatitis D. Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test , eye exam , image study liver gall bladder . A liver biopsy may also perform . - Participants receive either lonafarnib placebo twice day 28 day . For first 3 day , participant stay hospital frequent blood test . Participants four clinic visit ( day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 ) blood urine test . Eye exams heart function test also give . Men may ask provide sperm sample test . - After 28 day treatment , participant stop take drug placebo . They regular followup visit 6 month stop treatment ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic delta hepatitis serious form chronic liver disease cause infection hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , small RNA virus require farnesylation major structural protein ( HDV antigen ) replication . We propose treat 12 14 patient chronic delta hepatitis use farnesyltransferase inhibitor ( FTI ) lonafarnib duration twenty-eight day . Farnesyltransferase inhibitor use therapy delta hepatitis . Patients HBsAg HDV RNA serum , elevated aminotransferase , moderate-to-severe chronic hepatitis HDV antigen liver biopsy enrol . Before receive therapy , patient monitor least three month regular test alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level undergo Clinical Center admission medical evaluation percutaneous liver biopsy . Two dose group lonafarnib assess , placebo cohort group . At clinic visit , patient question side effect symptom , undergo focused physical examination , blood drawn complete blood count , HDV RNA , routine liver test ( include ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase , direct total bilirubin , albumin ) . At two-week interval , period 28 day , patient also test HBsAg , anti-HBs , HBV DNA , prothrombin time . At end 28 day treatment , patient undergo repeat physical examination , assessment symptom ( use symptom scale questionnaire ) , complete blood count , routine liver test , hepatitis B D viral marker . The primary therapeutic endpoint improvement quantitative serum HDV RNA level 28 day lonafarnib therapy . The primary safety endpoint ability tolerate drug prescribe dose 4 week duration . Several secondary endpoint measure , include side effect , ALT level , symptom . Therapy stop intolerance lonafarnib ( carefully define ) . This study design phase 2a study assess safety , tolerance antiviral activity two dose level lonafarnib , farnesyltransferase inhibitor .</detailed_description>

Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous year . 7 . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma . 8 . Evidence concurrent hepatitis C infection positive serum HCV RNA . 9 . Any experimental therapy apart pegylated interferon within 6 month prior enrollment . 10 . Diagnosis malignancy five year prior enrollment exception grant superficial dermatologic malignancy . 11 . Evidence HIV coinfection ; HIV ( Omega ) antibody positivity serum test . 12 . Concurrent usage statin drug inhibit mevalonate synthesis reduces protein prenylation . 13 . Concurrent usage moderate strong CYP3A inhibitor inducer . 14 . Inability understand sign inform consent . 15 . Any condition , opinion investigator would impede patient participation compliance study .</criteria>
