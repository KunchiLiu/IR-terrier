	<brief_summary>This two-part study . Part A three-period study approximately 24 healthy male Japanese Caucasian subject . Period 1 Period 2 open label study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics single ascend intravenous dos GSK2251052 . Period 3 single blind , placebo control , repeat fix dose design evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics multiple intravenous dos GSK2251052 12 day . The selection repeat IV dose base result Periods 1 2 . Japanese subject stratify base metabolic genotype , polymorphic wild-type ADH ALDH . Caucasian subject anticipate enzyme polymorphism therefore stratify . Part B two cohort , single-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-rising , repeat dose study approximately 24 healthy male female subject evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics supratherapeutic IV dose GSK2251052 10 day . Cohort 1 subject randomize receive 2250 mg GSK2251052 placebo Cohort 2 subject randomize receive 3000 mg GSK2251052 placebo . The decision conduct Cohort 2 Part B base available toxicology cover result ongoing preclinical toxicity study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Healthy adult male Japanese healthy adult Caucasian male . In Part B , healthy adult male female ( Part B ) determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects coagulation , reticulocyte , Hgb value outside normal range always exclude enrollment . Japanese define born Japan , four ethnic Japanese grandparent , hold Japanese passport identity paper able speak Japanese . Japanese subject also live outside Japan le 10 year . The following genetic variant ADH ALDH acceptable : Group 1 Japanese : ADH1B ( */1*1 ) , ADH1B ( *1/*2 ) , ADH1B ( *2/*2 ) ; ALDH2 ( *1/*1 ) . Group 2 Japanese : ADH1B ( */1*1 ) , ADH1B ( *1/*2 ) , ADH1B ( *2/*2 ) ; ALDH2 ( *1/*2 ) ; ADH1B ( */1*1 ) , ADH1B ( *1/*2 ) , ADH1B ( *2/*2 ) ; ALDH2 ( *2/*2 ) . Group 3 Caucasian : ADH1B ( */1*1 ) ; ALDH2 ( *1/*1 ) Part A : Japanese Caucasian Male 20 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Part B : Males Females 18 55 year age inclusive , time signing consent . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 21 day final dose . A female eligible enter participate study nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : Has hysterectomy Has bilateral oophorectomy ( removal ovary ) Has bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal ( demonstration total cessation menses ≥ 1 year date screen visit ) . A follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level perform confirm postmenopausal state . For study FSH level ≥ 40mIU/mL consistent menopause . If subject estrogen replacement menopausal status questionable , estrogen replacement discontinue 2 week subject rescreened , estrogen replacement suppress FSH . Part A : For Japanese subject : Body weight ≥ 50 kg BMI within range 18.5 29.0 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . For Caucasian subject : Body weight ≥ 50 kg BMI within range 19 32 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . Part B : Body weight ≥ 50 kg male 45 kg female BMI within range 18.5 31.0 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form .

As result medical interview , physical examination , screen investigation , Investigator considers subject unfit study . History bleed clot disorder include disseminate intravascular coagulation , hemophilia HenochSchönlein purpura ( allergic purpura ) , hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia , thrombocytopenia , thrombophilia Von Willebrand 's disease . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . A positive test HIV antibody . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Part A : Female subject . Part B : Female subject childbearing potential . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Subject mentally legally incapacitate . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Unwilling abstain alcohol least 7 day prior dose 21 day final dose study medication . Part A : Subjects smoke history &gt; 10 cigarette per day last 3 month . Part B : History regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . Subjects creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min calculate Cockcroft Gault equation . [ Cockcroft , 1976 ] CLcr ( mL/min ) = ( 140 age ) * Wt / ( 72 * Scr ) ( time 0.85 female ) age year , weight ( Wt ) kg , serum creatinine ( Scr ) unit mg/dL .
