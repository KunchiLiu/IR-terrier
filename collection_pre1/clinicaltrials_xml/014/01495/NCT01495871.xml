	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability young people . It call `` signature wound '' Iraq war frequency among troop . TBI associate many chronic disability . Physical alteration include reduce exercise tolerance profound muscle weakness , whereas psychological alteration include diminished sense well-being , depression , fatigue anxiety . Muscle brain tissue rely upon circulate blood amino acid precursor metabolic function . The investigator show even one year injury , plasma valine , essential amino acid ( EAA ) , markedly reduce patient TBI compare healthy control . The investigator speculate low plasma valine concentration contribute chronic fatigue TBI , since valine tryptophan compete transporter brain , low plasma valine concentration allow tryptophan transport . As consequence , increase brain tryptophan increase serotonin production , may significantly contribute development fatigue . Thus , investigator test restore valine concentration person TBI may reduce fatigue perception improve physical neuropsychological function . Further , investigator previously show EAA intake anabolic effect healthy young elderly individual . However , data currently available person recover TBI . Thus , investigator also test EAA and/or valine improve muscle mass patient TBI .</brief_summary>
