	<brief_title>GM-CSF Immunomodulation Following Trauma ( GIFT ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current phase study open-label dose-finding phase critically injured child undergo prospective , serial immune function test first day injury . If subject 's immune function ( measure whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production capacity ) critical threshold , subject receive GM-CSF dose 30 , 62 , 125 mcg/m2 per day three day . Enrollment stratify pubertal status ( Tanner 1 Tanner &gt; 1 ) presence absence severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Dose-finding conduct independently strata . The outcome variable dose-finding phase GIFT study restoration TNF-alpha production capacity monocyte HLA-DR expression end treatment , persist post-trauma day 7 . A subsequent randomized , placebo-controlled trial nosocomial infection primary outcome variable plan dose-finding complete . This study conduct NICHD 's Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ( CPCCRN ) Nationwide Children 's Hospital primary site . The study design information currently display site refers dose-finding phase project .</detailed_description>
