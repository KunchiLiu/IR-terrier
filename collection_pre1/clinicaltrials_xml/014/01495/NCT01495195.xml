	<brief_title>Combined Donepezil Selegiline Effects Cocaine-Reinforced Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : We recently show pretreatment certain cholinesterase inhibitor produce large reduction cocaine-reinforced behavior rat ( drug self-administration decrease 70 % period three day additional cholinesterase inhibitor administer ) . Because reduction persist period two week , describe persistent attenuation . Similar reduction observe rat receive pretreatment cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil tacrine , rivastigmine . The key difference lead persistent attenuation may effect donepezil tacrine catecholamine neurotransmitter . Specifically , hypothesis persistent attenuation cause combination 1 . ) Cholinesterase inhibition , increase brain level acetylcholine ( ACh ) ; 2 . ) Increased brain level dopamine serotonin . Although well-tolerated , pretreatment low dos cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil modify either positive subjective effect cocaine human , cocaine use outpatient . This may reflect relatively low dos donepezil administer ( 10 mg daily ) . Transdermal selegiline well-tolerated , nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor potentiate action dopamine serotonin central nervous system . Rationale Persistent attenuation may achieve human administer donepezil high dos , combination centrally-acting inhibitor monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) . Inhibition MAO increase brain level dopamine serotonin . If persistent attenuation accomplish human , would lead important paradigm shift substance abuse treatment , large reduction cocaine-reinforced behavior could produce without need continuous dose medication . This scenario could remove requirement continue compliance oral dosing patient associate potential toxicity . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine whether donepezil safely advanced 17-day period individualize dose 22.5 mg daily ( high dose tolerate participant ) . 2 . Evaluate whether high-dose donepezil attenuate cocaine-reinforced behavior human . 3 . Determine whether combined donepezil selegiline produce great reduction cocaine-reinforced behavior observe donepezil alone . Methods This randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled , research-unit , single-center evaluation potential oral donepezil , without transdermal selegiline modify cocaine self-administration laboratory setting . Up 32 non-treatment-seeking , regular cocaine user assign receive one four treatment : 1 . ) Oral placebo ; 2 . ) High-Dose Donepezil [ titrate 22.5 mg daily ] ; 3 . ) Low-Dose Donepezil [ titrate 10 mg daily ] transdermal selegiline [ 6 mg daily ] ; 4 . ) High-Dose Donepezil [ titrate 22.5 mg daily ] transdermal selegiline [ 6 mg daily ] . For participant receive donepezil , advance either target dose ( low high ) , low dose tolerate individual participant . To evaluate occurrence persistent attenuation , cocaine use measure nine-day follow-up period , urine drug screen timeline-follow-back method . As noncontingent infusion cocaine administer , pharmacokinetics cocaine donepezil determine .</detailed_description>
