	<brief_title>Impact Diabetes Transitions Tool Kit Post-Hospitalization Glycemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes affect 12-25 % hospitalized adult patient , 30 % hospitalize diabetes patient one readmission within one year . While glycemic control rarely primary reason admission , poor glycemic control associate increase rate hospitalization bad clinical outcome , include infection , poor wound heal , death . Hospitalization propose `` teachable moment '' patient diabetes , intensive contact full range expert clinician , effect change implement hospitalization discharge poorly study . The objective study conduct randomize control trial test novel approach diabetes management transition inpatient outpatient care . We assign 40 hospitalized adult patient type 2 diabetes usual care access web-based patient-provider communication remote glucose monitoring tool ( `` Diabetes Transitions Tool Kit '' ) . Our aim evaluate feasibility implementation tool well impact post-discharge glycemic control , diabetes-related self-care distress . We hypothesize provide patient web-based tool 4-week period discharge home result effective glycemic control compare usual care , patient access `` tool kit '' trend towards improve diabetes self-management less diabetes-related distress . Feasibility preliminary data pilot study foundation larger-scale intervention may ultimately improve delivery diabetes care transition hospital home .</detailed_description>
