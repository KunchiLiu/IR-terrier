	<brief_summary>Various medical procedure require different object insert airway ; example , bronchoscope - fibreoptic camera device - guide windpipe gain real-time image airway . Since insert object throat uncomfortable patient , doctor several option , one put patient sleep use general anesthetic inserting something windpipe . This may always best option , especially case patient need awake procedure . In case , doctor may 'freeze ' windpipe insert scope tube airway . For , doctor insert needle front neck injects local anesthetic . Inserting needle windpipe come risks patient , doctor want avoid puncture nearby structure , artery , vein , esophagus . The investigator come new method accurately guide needle airway alert user successfully place needle tip windpipe . The investigator hypothesize new method prove beneficial clinician emergency medical personnel need fast , easy , reliable way insert needle airway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrically Guided Needle Insertion : Transtracheal Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale The trachea anesthetize several different method , one transtracheal injection local anesthetic lidocaine . This technique perform prepare patient variety procedure , include awake fibreoptic intubation cricothyroidotomy . Tracheal anesthesia perform first identify cricothyroid ligament ; structure generally locate place one finger thyroid cartilage another cricoid cartilage . Approximately 4-6 mL local anesthetic deliver small needle intravenous catheter insert neck midline . Anesthesia occur quickly permit patient awake aware procedure follow . Insertion needle trachea without risk patient . Several complicate factor affect success rate tracheal needle insertion , emergency situation oxygen must deliver insertion site , cricothyroidotomy , accurate needle insertion mean difference life death patient . One complicate factor procedure thyroid cartilage cricoid cartilage difficult identify , especially obese people . Needle insertion make complicate due anatomy surround cricothyroid membrane : carotid artery jugular vein lie laterally membrane , cricothyroid artery locate superiorly laterally , highly vascularize thyroid gland locate inferiorly . Intravascular injection anesthetic lead seizure , inaccurate injection could lead anesthesia surround nerve . There also risk puncture posterior wall trachea , may cause esophageal perforation . Given complication , quick easy method ensure accurate tracheal needle insertion , avoid damage surround tissue , would greatly benefit clinician could potentially save life emergency situation . We wish evaluate simple technique guide needle tip trachea mitigate risk conventional method needle insertion . We use nerve stimulation equipment aid guidance placement needle tip tracheal lumen , predict faster accurate current conventional method . The nerve stimulation technology alert user exact moment needle tip suspend trachea also alert user needle tip contact body tissue , avoid accidental puncture lateral posterior tracheal wall . We believe method electrically-guided needle insertion significant improvement current method percutaneous needle insertion transtracheal injection . Study objective To assess value nerve stimulation equipment guidance placement needle-catheter assembly transtracheal injection . Hypothesis Nerve stimulation equipment help physician guide insert needle tip tracheal lumen accuracy conventional technique . Study Design This prospective , descriptive , interventional study . Study Procedures This study involve recruit consent patient undergoing procedure require awake fibreoptic intubation follow transtracheal injection local anesthetic . We intend recruit 30 patient , randomize two group , one ( experimental ) undergo transtracheal injection use needle connect nerve stimulation device , another ( control ) receive tracheal anesthetic use standard , conventional needle insertion injection technique . Patients lay supine head neck neutral position one pillow . The physician locate cricothyroid ligament , needle-catheter assembly insert . In experimental group , 21G 64 mm insulate needle 18G catheter assembly ( MultiSet , Pajunk , Germany ) commonly use nerve stimulator ( HNS 12 , B.Braun , Germany ) use access airway ( nerve stimulator device approve use live patient Canada common piece equipment operate room ) . The nerve stimulator connect current meter , ground electrode attach body . When needle tip contact body tissue ( i.e. , tracheal wall ) , electrical circuit close , produce read 1.0 mA current reader . Suspension needle tip airway interrupt circuit , produce read 0.0 mA . In addition , audible signal build nerve stimulator alert user change current , warn needle tip advance far contact posterior lateral tracheal wall . Once physician successfully insert needle tip tracheal lumen , needle withdrawn 4-6 mL lidocaine ( 2-4 % ) deliver catheter , anesthetize airway . Once airway anesthetize , bronchoscope guide trachea . The control group undergo identical procedure , except nerve stimulator connect needle . For patient , physician perform transtracheal injection document opinion needle insertion injection , personal information patient record time . For experimental control group , study investigator collect data document time need needle insertion success attempt . These data statistically analyze determine value nerve stimulator-guided technique conventional technique .</detailed_description>
