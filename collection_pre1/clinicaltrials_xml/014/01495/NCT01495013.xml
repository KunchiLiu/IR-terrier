	<brief_summary>The aim 20 week study show glimepiride/atorvastatin fix dose combination tablet safe effective atorvastatin + glimepiride combination take separate tablet , improve glycaemic control ( glycated haemoglobin , HbA1c ) cholesterol level ( Low-density lipoprotein , LDL ) diabetic subject , inadequately control stable dose metformin . Eight dose combination include .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) initially provide lifestyle advice order manage condition diet , exercise weight reduction , follow treatment metformin . However , many patient gain adequate control fast glucose method anti-diabetic agent need . Furthermore , patient increase cardiovascular risk compare general population . Approximately one half patient T2D die prematurely cardiovascular cause approximately 10 % die renal failure . Atherogenic dyslipidemia , define triad elevate triglyceride , low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , small low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) particle , commonly find individual T2D . In diabetic patient , LDL particles tend small , denser , atherogenic general population . As result , patient diabetes , lower LDL-C level may lead great benefit term Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk reduction patient without diabetes . Multiple clinical trial demonstrate significant benefit lipid-lowering ( primarily statin ) therapy CVD outcomes primary secondary prevention , irrespective baseline lipid level . Hence , clinical treatment guideline recommend patient T2D treat anti-diabetic agent statin . Glimepiride establish once-daily sulphonylurea use first-line therapy , often used patient metformin intolerant , fail achieve glucose control metformin monotherapy . Atorvastatin establish statin indicate reduce risk cardiovascular event diabetic patient , without clinically evident coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , irrespective whether cholesterol raise . The risk : benefit glimepiride atorvastatin well establish describe approved product label . There widespread use glimepiride atorvastatin , prescribe separately , T2D population . The available literature indicate drug-drug interaction risk associate combination therapy clinical PK interaction atorvastatin glimepiride record . A once-daily combination product combine glimepiride atorvastatin fulfil unmet clinical need simplify patient treatment regimens patient population significant disease burden . Providing concurrent access statin patient T2D , addition medication manage glucose level , critical requirement ensure appropriate management cardio-metabolic risk . In study , subject already stable dose metformin randomise either receive glimepiride/atorvastatin fix dose combination treatment atorvastatin + glimepiride combination take separate tablet . The start dose subject 1mg glimepiride 10mg atorvastatin . The glimepiride dose titrate average fast glucose &gt; 7.0mmol/L . The atorvastatin dose titrate LDL &gt; 2.6mmol/L . The purpose study demonstrate non-inferiority glimepiride/atorvastatin fix dose combination compare glimepiride +atorvastatin take separate tablet reduce HbA1c LDL .</detailed_description>
