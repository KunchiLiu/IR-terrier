	<brief_title>Markers Coronary Artery Disease During Exercise Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest pain/discomfort common patient complaint patient refer outpatient clinic emergency department . The initial goal evaluation exclude potential life threaten condition like coronary artery disease . Exercise stress test widely available non-invasive test patient chest pain suspect coronary artery disease . However , sensitivity specificity test relatively low . Exercise seem cause increase secretion B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , myocardial ischemia may lead even pronounced increase . Investigators aim examine whether change bloodborne biomarkers NT-pro-BNP exercise may improve accuracy exercise stress test patient chest pain/discomfort clinical suspicion coronary artery disease . Also , investigator aim examine whether change biomarkers exercise relate cardiac disease demonstrate echocardiography . It known sudden heavy physical load trigger myocardial infarction , especially untrained individual . The underlying mechanism poorly understood may partly relate change inflammation haemostasis patient coronary artery disease . By measure marker inflammation haemostasis exercise stress testing , investigator hope gain new insight mechanisms responsible exercise-related myocardial infarction . Investigators also aim follow-up study investigate whether result initial examination relate future risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
