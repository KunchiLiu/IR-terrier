	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine recommend dose I-131-CLR1404 , radiolabeled therapy compound , treat subject cancer respond treatment return . The identify recommend dose study use optimal dose I-131-CLR1404 subsequent clinical trial conduct later phase clinical development . Subjects meet study entry criterion receive I-131-CLR1404 . For subject , study conduct two phase , dosimetric therapy . In dosimetric phase , subject receive one 5 mCi dose study drug undergo whole body image day infusion post-infusion day 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 assessment biodistribution I-131-CLR1404 . If normal expect biodistribution demonstrate , subject begin therapy phase . In therapy phase , first cohort subject receive dose 12.5 mCi/m2 . Dose escalation subsequent cohort initially increment 12.5 mCi/m2 . Subjects follow observed unacceptable toxicity 56 day therapy dose infusion follow-up one year . All subject prescribe thyroid protection medication take 24 hour prior injection dosimetric dose , continue 14 day administration therapy dose .</brief_summary>
