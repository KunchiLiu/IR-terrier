	<brief_summary>Patients undergo rotator cuff repair subacromial decompression investigator institution frequently hospitalize overnight due inadequate pain relief resolution interscalene brachial plexus block . For ropivacaine 0.5 % , investigator usual local anesthetic , previous study report analgesic duration 11.1 ± 5 hour without epinephrine approximately 12 hour epinephrine . Consequently , method prolong analgesia brachial plexus block without extra equipment logistical difficulty indwell catheter would benefit patient caregiver . A potential approach use adjuvant drug prolong block duration add local anesthetic . In addition usual adjuvant anesthetic drug , investigator begin evaluate glucocorticoid adjuvant regional anesthesia . Known anti-inflammatory , analgesic , immunosuppressive , antiemetic property , corticosteroid exert effect inhibition phospholipase A2 well change cell function induce glucocorticoid receptor activation . Although associated significant toxicity administer large dos long period , emerge literature suggest single perioperative dose glucocorticoid safe . Several study , include recent trial investigator institution , demonstrate efficacy dexamethasone prolong regional anesthetic . Available data thus suggest combine glucocorticoid local anesthetic prolongs block duration . However , systemic glucocorticoid also show reduce postoperative pain . This raise question whether beneficial effect add glucocorticoid regional anesthetic solely due local effect mediate least part systemic action . Previous trial , however , address important issue . If beneficial effect analgesic duration mediate systemic action , add dexamethasone local anesthetic mixture may unnecessary . Although study report neurotoxicity perineural dexamethasone laboratory data appear confirm safety route , achieve similar result conventional administration would desirable two reason . First , conventional intravenous dose convenient , useful reason ( example , postoperative nausea prophylaxis ) , well-studied . Second , equivalent ( equivalent ) result systemic dose would provide valuable information mechanism behind dexamethasone 's effect block duration .</brief_summary>
