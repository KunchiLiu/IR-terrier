	<brief_summary>Background : - Some cancer treatment collect patient blood cell use specialized cancer-fighting cell . Collected white blood cell know PBL ( peripheral blood lymphocyte ) use isolate special cell fight tumor . Before treatment PBL , chemotherapy give destroy exist white blood cell new cell survive attack tumor . After PBL treatment , aldesleukin give help new cell grow . Researchers want see special white blood cell recognize specific protein present melanoma cell ( melanoma antigen recognize T cell ( MART ) ) cause tumor shrink . These white blood cell test without aldesleukin . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness white blood cell target MART treatment melanoma . - To test white blood cell target MART without aldesleukin . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age melanoma respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . Blood urine sample take . Imaging study x-rays magnetic resonance imaging scan perform . - Participants provide white blood cell leukapheresis . Researchers attempt isolate white blood cell recognize MART - Seven day start treatment , participant chemotherapy . - After last dose chemotherapy , participant receive MART reactive PBL cell . Filgrastim dose also give help white blood cell count return normal . Participants frequent blood test . - Participants able aldesleukin treatment start within 24 hour receive MART reactive PBL cell . Treatment continue 5 day . - Participants may optional tumor lymph node biopsy study effect treatment . - If tumor continue grow MART PBL treatment , participant may one round cell collection treatment . - Participants followup visit 6 month receive MART reactive PBL treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - TIL transfer study patient metastatic melanoma follow lymphodepletion result 50 percent objective response rate 10-15 percent rate complete response . Despite important clinical finding , adoptive cell transfer become widely available patient treatment . Significant obstacle therapy need invasive surgery inability patient tolerate high dose aldesleukin . Further , specific characteristic T cell responsible therapeutic effect tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) unknown , thus , result significant treatment variability . - Pre-clinical correlative clinical study adoptive immunotherapy suggest putative favorable characteristic transfer lymphocyte , , high avidity target antigen , limited vitro stimulation , high expression CD27+ . However , characteristic prospectively evaluate human clinical trial . - We develop novel non invasive T cell isolation strategy use heteroclitic MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide vitro sensitization human PBL high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) screen rapidly isolate antigen specific cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) + T cell cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) + T cell deplete peripheral blood repertoire . These isolated T cell posse mention favorable characteristic recognize native MART-1:27-35 epitope , abundantly express melanoma antigen present human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A2 ) tumor surface . - The current propose transfer select MART-1:27-35 reactive lymphocytes conjunction lymphodepleting preparative regimen without high dose aldesleukin would represent novel therapeutic option patient advance melanoma provide desperately need option patient medically eligible aldesleukin treatment . Objectives : - To determine whether MART-1:27-35 reactive lymphocyte infuse without administration high-dose aldesleukin may result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma receive non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . - To evaluate safety treatment patient receive non-myeloablative condition regimen cell transfer without administration high-dose aldesleukin - To determine survival patient , infused cell follow administration non-myeloablative regimen , use analysis sequence variable region T cell receptor flow cytometry ( fluorescence activate cell sort ( FACS ) ) . Eligibility : -Patients refractory metastatic melanoma great equal 18 year age , HLA-A2+ , MART-1:27-35 reactive peripheral blood lymphocyte available physically able tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy . Patients must refractory prior high dose aldesleukin treatment medically eligible receive . Patients tolerate high-dose aldesleukin receive cell infusion ; tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due medical comorbidities refuse high-dose aldesleukin receive cell infusion without aldesleukin . Design : - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day X 2 day intravenous ( IV ) ) , fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV X 5 day ) . - Patients receive intravenous adoptive transfer MART-1:27-35 reactive peripheral blood lymphocyte ( minimum 1 X 10^8 maximum 3 X 10^11 lymphocyte ) follow high-dose intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hour 15 dos ) aldesleukin medically eligible receive . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 4-6 week last dose aldesleukin aldesleukin arm 4-6 week cell administration aldesleukin arm . Patients enrol two cohort . The cohort receive high-dose aldesleukin conduct use small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 19 patient enrol , 4 first 19 patient clinical response ( ( partial response ) PR ( complete response ) CR ) , accrual continue 33 patient , target 35 percent goal objective response . For cohort receive aldesleukin , study conduct Minimax two stage phase II trial . Initially 12 evaluable patient enrol cohort , 1 first 12 response , accrual would continue total 21 patient , target 20 percent goal objective response .</detailed_description>
