	<brief_summary>This phase 2 clinical trial randomize patient BRAF mutant melanoma either ( 1 ) standard care ( SOC ) - BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib combination MEK inhibitor cobimetinib ; , ( 2 ) SOC plus bevacizumab , anti-VEGF antibody suppress new blood vessel formation stimulate immune system . Previous clinical study melanoma show bevacizumab may improve clinical benefit ( progression free survival ) combine ipilimumab abraxane . Preclinical study suggest VEGF increase play role resistance BRAF inhibitor . This randomized study ask whether addition bevacizumab target therapy SOC BRAF mutant melanoma improve response rate clinical benefit . Patients may receive therapy advanced disease 2 prior therapy , exclude BRAF MEK inhibitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib With Without Bevacizumab Patients With Stage IV BRAFV600 Mutant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , drug use vemurafenib , cobimetinib , bevacizumab . Vemurafenib approve FDA treatment patient advance melanoma harbor BRAF mutation . However , vemurafenib combination cobimetinib approve FDA treatment cancer . Bevacizumab approve FDA use combination first line chemotherapy treatment patient colorectal , breast lung cancer . Bevacizumab approve use patient metastatic melanoma . Vemurafenib cobimetinib attack different protein cause cancer cell grow . Vemurafenib work block protein call B-RAF . Researchers find large number melanoma mutation ( change ) BRAF gene . The BRAF gene code protein call B-RAF , involve sending signal cell lead cell growth . Research determine mutation BRAF gene V600 position cause change B-RAF protein drive growth spread melanoma cell . Vemurafenib work prevent alter B-RAF protein work , thereby may block growth spread cancer cell patient melanoma . Cobimetinib work block protein call MEK . MEK known promote growth cancer carry either mutation BRAF KRAS gene . The vemurafenib/cobimetinib combination use prior clinical study . Information research study suggest drug shrink melanoma tumor majority patient slow tumor growth compare standard chemotherapy . Another drug block BRAF MEK proteins recently approve FDA treatment patient B-RAFV600 mutant melanoma . The researcher want see use vemurafenib cobimetinib together work similar way treat malignant melanoma . Bevacizumab humanize monoclonal antibody ( type protein normally make immune system help defend body infection cancer ) produce use recombinant DNA technology . Bevacizumab antibody direct vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF . VEGF potent , specific growth factor well-defined role normal abnormal blood vessel formation . It present wide variety normal tissue , produce excess solid cancer ( tumor ) . In set cancer , VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell . Its expression tumor associate bad outcome patient number tumor type include melanoma . In laboratory experiment , bevacizumab inhibits growth several different type human cancer cell block effect VEGF . The purpose research study determine effectiveness use study drug vemurafenib , cobimetinib , bevacizumab together relative vemurafenib cobimetinib alone . This study investigate whether use study drug lengthen amount time participant ' melanoma worsens , increase number people whose melanoma respond treatment side effect use drug together rather separately .</detailed_description>
