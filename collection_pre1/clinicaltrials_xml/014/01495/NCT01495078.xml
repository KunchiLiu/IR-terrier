	<detailed_description>The insuﬁcie ` ncia Cardı´aca Optimitzacio ´ Remota ( iCOR ; Heart Failure Remote Optimization ) trial singlecentre , randomize , open-label study design evaluate eﬃcacy addition telemedicine ( telemonitorization teleintervention use videoconference ) exist specialize , multidisciplinary , nurse-based , hospitalprimary care integrate HF programme high-risk patient CHF . The organizational characteristic programme impact health outcome result implementation previously published.2 In study aim compare strategy provide nurse-based structured follow-up high-risk CHF patient plan contact health care provider patient and/or caregiver basis face-to-face on-site encounter ( usual care HF programme ) provide plan care use telemedicine combination remote daily monitoring sign symptom HF ( telemonitoring ) delivery structure nursebased follow-up health care use videoconference ( teleintervention ) . The main hypothesis study add telemedicine exist HF programme would associate reduction number non-fatal HF event high-risk patient CHF . As secondary hypothesis assume add telemedicine would translate reduction health care resource utilization subsequently health care cost .</detailed_description>
