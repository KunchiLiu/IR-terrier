	<detailed_description>According Rome III criterion , abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGD ) child may categorise functional dyspepsia ( FD ) , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , abdominal migraine functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) . Because obscure pathophysiology , management abdominal pain-related FGD remain difficult , prompt interest new safe treatment options.Glucomannan prebiotic nondigestible food ingredient beneficially affect host selectively stimulating growth ⁄ activity bacteria already resident colon . Up publish one randomize control trial show treatment prebiotic ( trans-galactooligosaccharide ) , induce qualitative change faecal flora , associate significant change stool consistency , flatulence , composite score ( abdominal pain ⁄ discomfort , bloat ⁄ distension bowel movement difficulty ) well subjective global assessment value adult patient irritable bowel syndrome . These finding suggest prebiotics potential therapeutic agent functional gastrointestinal disorder . Methods Patients recruit child refer Department Pediatrics , The Medical University Warsaw . Each potentially eligible patient evaluate full review clinical history physical examination . Subjects receive questionnaire record frequency severity pain , drug use symptom consider important last 4 week . Patients consider study inclusion , 8-18 year age abdominal pain - relate disorder ( i.e . ( functional dyspepsia , irritable bowel syndrome functional abdominal pain ( FD IBS FAP ) classify accord Rome III diagnostic criterion . Patients organic gastrointestinal disease ( establish medical history , complete blood count , urinalysis , stool examination occult blood , ova parasite , blood chemistry , abdominal ultrasound , breath hydrogen test endoscopy , need ) , chronic disease , growth failure exclude study . A total 90 child fulfill Rome III criterion functional dyspepsia ( FD ) , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) enrol double-blind , randomize control trial receive either glucomannan 10g ( n = 45 ) , placebo ( n = 45 ) 4 week . At end study patient fulfill questionnaire assess outcome measure . The primary outcome measure treatment success define pain ( relaxed face , score 0 , Faces Pain Scale ) end intervention . The secondary outcome measure ( ) improvements self-reported severity pain define change least two face score measure Faces Pain Scale ; ( ii ) self-reported frequency pain precede month ; ( iii ) use medication abdominal pain ( iv ) school absenteeism abdominal pain . ( v ) adverse event study period . Statistical Methods The statistical analysis conduct StatsDirect . The Mann-Whitney U test use compare mean continuous variable non-normal distribution assess . Proportions compare Fisher exact test . The difference study group consider significant P value &lt; .05 . result study analyzed basis intention treat .</detailed_description>
