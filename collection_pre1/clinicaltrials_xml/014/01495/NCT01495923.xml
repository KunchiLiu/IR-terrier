	<detailed_description>142 patient refer participate pain clinic lumbosacral radiculopathy randomize 1:1 ratio receive one two treatment . Half ( n=71 ) patient allocate receive ESI ( group I ) , equal number allocate receive gabapentin ( group II ) . Group I patient unilateral symptom receive ( unilateral ) transforaminal ESI , bilateral symptom receive ( central ) interlaminar ESI , common practice . In group II patient receive gabapentin , dose titrated 1800 mg/d 2700 mg/d TID dosing , may lower elevate ( 3600 mg/d ) depend clinical circumstance . To ensure blinding , patient also receive midline ( patient bilateral symptom would receive interlaminar ESI ) unilateral paraspinal ( patient unilateral symptom would receive transforaminal ESI ) normal saline interspinal ligament paraspinal musculature , respectively . Injections medication titration commence day . Rescue medication consist tramadol 50 mg 1 2 tablet every 6 hour PRN ( 8/d ) and/or ibuprofen 400-800 mg every 6 hour PRN ( not-to-exceed 3000 mg/d ) . Patients already take analgesic , include opioids , continue medication `` need '' . The first follow-up visit schedule 1-month start treatment . A positive outcome define &gt; 2-point decrease leg pain couple positive satisfaction rating . Subjects obtain positive outcome initial 1-month follow-up visit remain study return final 3-month follow-up visit . Those negative outcome exit study `` per protocol '' receive standard care , may consist unblinded ESI , medical management drug gabapentin ( receive gabapentin ) antidepressant , physical therapy . Subjects obtain positive outcome 1-month experience recurrence 3-month follow-up visit also exit study per protocol , final outcome measure record receive standard care . At follow-up visit , pill count conduct determine medication compliance .</detailed_description>
