	<brief_summary>Background : - Pomalidomide drug treat cancer several mechanism . It take mouth ( orally ) . Pomalidomide help treat cancer block certain factor promote tumor growth stimulate immune system attack tumor cell . It also prevent growth new blood vessel help cancer grow . Researchers want see pomalidomide treat Kaposi sarcoma , rare potentially fatal skin cancer . Because Kaposi sarcoma may associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , researcher want test drug people without HIV infection . Objectives : - To see pomalidomide safe effective treatment Kaposi sarcoma people without HIV . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age Kaposi sarcoma . - Participants may may HIV infection . Design : - Potential participant screen medical history physical exam . Blood saliva sample take chest X-ray performed . A skin biopsy Kaposi sarcoma lesion may perform one already do . Other image study may perform need . - Participants take pomalidomide capsule every day 3 week , follow 1-week break . These 28 day one cycle treatment . - Participants six cycle treatment , unless lesion completely resolve sooner . If sign improvement six cycle lesion completely go , another six cycle treatment may give . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test study include photograph image skin lesion . - Participants regular follow-up visit 5 year stop treatment ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Kaposi Sarcoma People With Without HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Kaposi Sarcoma ( KS ) incurable , multicentric angioproliferative tumor frequently involve skin . It see frequently people HIV form immune compromise . Current therapy limit toxicity , include cumulative cardiotoxicity , effective oral agent , agent deliverable resource-limited setting , agent deliverable long-term relapse disease lacking . Objective : The primary objective study : Assess safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics pomalidomide subject Kaposi sarcoma , whether HIV associate . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year - Measurable , pathologically confirm KS - Any HIV status ; HIV-associated KS subject must receive able comply HAART achieve HIV viral load &lt; 10,000 copies/mL - Hematologic biochemical parameter within prespecified limit baseline - Willing use effective birth control , define full protocol - For subject enrol anti-tumor activity assessment phase , KS HIV-associated must increase despite HAART HIV suppression great equal 2 month , stable despite HAART great equal 3 month - No symptomatic pulmonary visceral KS - No specific KS therapy within 4 week ( 6 week therapy bevacizumab ) - Neither pregnant breast feed Design : This open label single agent phase I/II study pomalidomide patient KS . In phase I portion , six subject initially treat pomalidomide 5mg daily 21 day 28 day cycle . Subject toxicity evaluation , dosage may deescalated 3mg daily 21 day 28 day cycle second cohort six subject . If either dose prof tolerable , study proceed phase II portion , additional subject goal 15 HIV positive 10 HIV negative subject evaluable response add high tolerable dose gain preliminary information activity .</detailed_description>

Must receive HAART least one month . Must achieve HIV VL &lt; 10,000 copies/mL . The following hematological parameter : Hemoglobin great equal 10 g/dL Platelets great equal 75,000 cells/mm ( 3 ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1000 cells/mm3 The following biochemical parameter : Estimated measure creatinine clearance great equal 45mL/minute Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Bilirubin le equal 1.5 time upper limit normal unless patient receive protease inhibitor therapy ( e.g . indinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , atazanavir ) know associate increased bilirubin , case total bilirubin less equal 7.5 mg/dL direct fraction less equal 0.7 mg/dL . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL within 14 day prior within 24 hour start pomalidomide must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take pomalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even vasectomy . All subject must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods , also All study participant must agree registered mandatory POMALYST REMS program , willing able comply requirement POMALYST REMS program . Females reproductive potential must willing adhere schedule pregnancy test require POMALYST REMS program . Able take aspirin 81mg daily intolerant aspirin , able take substitute thromboprophylaxis low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylactic dose ( enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg daily ) . Willing able give inform consent . For subject HIVassociated enter tolerable dose determine , KS lesions must either : Increasing despite HAART HIV suppression limit detection ( 48 copies/mL ) two month prior screen Stable despite HAART least three month . Stable disease must symptomatic ( example symptomatic disease include disease associate pain , edema , psychological distress and/or social withdrawal ) . This gain preliminary information pomalidomide activity without confound due HAART initiation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Symptomatic pulmonary KS . Symptomatic visceral KS ( except nonulcerating disease restrict oral cavity ) . Specific KS therapy , include cytotoxic chemotherapy include HAART , within past 4 week ( 6 week therapy bevacizumab ) .
