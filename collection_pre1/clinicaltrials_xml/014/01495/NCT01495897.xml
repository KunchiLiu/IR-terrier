	<detailed_description>Dystonia movement disorder characterize involuntary , sustain , often repetitive muscle contraction opposite muscle lead abnormal twist movement odd posture . Essential tremor slowly progressive neurologic disorder characterize appearance tremor voluntary movement . High frequency stimulation ventral intermedius nucleus ( Vim ) thalamus , relay cerebellar output , successfully use treatment severe essential tremor . It occasionally induce adverse event balance disorder cerebellar symptom . The pathophysiology dystonia essential tremor fully elucidate . Dystonia essential tremor associate dysfunction sensorimotor basal ganglia-cortical network involvement cerebellum cerebellar pathway also recently suggest . It seem dystonia essential tremor could result basal ganglion cerebellar dysfunction , dysfunction structure control time cerebellum basal ganglion . methodology : We propose study 30 patient primary dystonia ( 15 DYT11 genetically document ) , 15 patient essential tremor without deep brain stimulation 15 patient essential tremor deep brain stimulation . A group 30 healthy volunteer recruit tested accord modality . They pair sex age . 30 patient Parkinson disease also test . The subject seat darkness face screen locate 60 cm eye , chin chin strap forehead place frontal support . Eye position sample 500 Hz video-based monocular eye tracker ( SMI , Germany ) . Each record session start calibration test subject look nine consecutive target cover entire visual field , use oculomotor paradigm : four experimental condition : visually guide saccade task , pre-test , backward adaptation task , post-test . The pre-test post-test ( 40 trial ) perform immediately backward adaptation task , condition , except target extinguish velocity threshold ( 150°/s 10 m ) reach , instead jump new location . This avoid post-saccadic visual feedback would counteract adaptive mechanism . Saccade adaptation evaluate percentage change mean saccade amplitude pre-test post-test . Expected result : - few alteration performance adaptation task Parkinson group Essential Tremor group/ dystonia group . - abnormal reactive saccade backward adaptation Dystonia group Essential Tremor group , provide neurophysiological evidence cerebellar dysfunction .</detailed_description>
