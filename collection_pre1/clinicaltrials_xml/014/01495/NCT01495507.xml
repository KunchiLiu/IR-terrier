	<brief_summary>The field patellofemoral disorder accordant therapeutical intervention high turnover research field . It important verify clinical outcome appropriate measuring tool . There evidence Kujala score reliable widely use measure instrument patellofemoral disorder . Indeed , Kujala score already use many study investigate patellofemoral disorder - also german speak patient group . Unfortunately , aware validated german version Kujala score . Other relevant knee outcome score already successfully translated german language validate previous investigator . So , aim study cross-culturally adapt validate Kujala score use German-speaking individual patellofemoral instability . It hypothesized german version Kujala score show : - High divergent construct validity determine significant difference patient control ( hypothesis 1 ) - High convergent construct validity determine significant correlation relevant score system ( hypothesis 2 ) - High reliability ( hypothesis 3 ) - High responsiveness ( hypothesis 4 )</brief_summary>
