	<brief_title>The Use Fluorescent Imaging Intraoperative Cholangiogram During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate whether systemically inject ICG , fluoresce response NIR illumination , assist identification CBD ( common bile duct ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy . This finding may assist surgeon perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy less time less morbidity standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.It expect successful outcome trial result less time operate room less morbidity follow laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Laparoscopic cholecystectomy indicate cholecystitis , biliary colic , resolve biliary pancreatitis , symptomatic cholelithiasis . Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involve introduction surgical instrument number ( usually 4 ) small incision measure 5-12 mm visual guidance provide mean camera attach endoscope introduce similarly small access port . Laparoscopic technique offer numerous benefit include decrease postoperative pain , improvement time tolerance food return bowel function , short hospital stay rapid return normal activity . Laparoscopic cholecystectomy one frequently perform surgical procedure United States . Iatrogenic bile duct injury serious complication patient undergo laparoscopic type cholecystectomy increase risk complication . To minimize risk injury , techniques `` critical view '' ( dissection visualization cystic duct cystic artery ) develop . However , adhesion , inflammation anatomical variation make surgical dissection identification significant structure difficult . In addition significantly longer operative time see attempt obtain critical view . Some advocate routine use cholangiography ( IOC ) national standard care remain perform IOC selectively . IOC require cannulation cystic duct , injection iodinate dye , fluoroscopy add significantly operative time morbidity especially center routine IOC perform . The present study investigate whether use NIRF injection ICG make identification Biliary structure CBD clearer decrease time require dissect critical structure perform safe cholecystectomy . The SPYÂ® Intraoperative Imaging System clear use Canada , Japan , Europe US . SPY originally develop application cardiac surgery allow cardiac surgeon visually assess bypass graft quality real-time patient still operate room . Subsequently , SPY receive clearance FDA use plastic reconstructive surgery solid organ transplant . The SPY Intraoperative Imaging System originally develop open surgical procedure use ICG , FDA approve drug . ICG fluorescent compound , administer intravenously intra-arterially . The dye absorbs light near infrared ( NIR ) region 806 nm , emits light slightly longer wavelength , 830 nm . When injected intravenously , ICG rapidly extensively bind plasma protein confine intravascular compartment minimal leakage interstitium normal condition . ICG take liver excrete biliary system image . The SPY System subject numerous peer review publication demonstrate safety . SPY scope , endoscopic version SPY , endoscopic visible ( VIS ) NIR image system consist : 1 . An endoscopic light source provide illumination visible light image NIR fluorescence excitation endoscope via flexible light guide 2 . Rigid endoscope optimize illuminating field view transmit image visible NIR spectrum , 3 . A high definition ( HD ) endoscopic camera system connect endoscope eyepiece acquire high resolution visible NIR fluorescence image The ICG ( 25 mg per vial ) reconstitute accord manufacturer 's instruction use entire content ( 10 ml ) sterile diluent supply , yield 2.5 mg/ml solution ICG use half diluent supply ( 5 ml ) yield 5 mg/ml solution . ICG Diagnostic Procedure : 3ml 2.5 mg/ml solution ( Akorn product , US Monograph ) The ICG may administer peripheral venous access . Based prior experience colorectal case 1.0 ml 2.5 mg/ml solution ICG ( flush 10 ml saline ) administer . Our study include patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis non-acute symptomatic cholelithiasis . The standard operating technique use patient include critical view technique fluoroscopic IOC clinically indicate . Our primary endpoint operative time measured time begin dissection gallbladder separate entirely gall bladder fossa . Secondary endpoint time identification structure safety operation . Other endpoint CBD injury postop bile leak include identify .</detailed_description>
