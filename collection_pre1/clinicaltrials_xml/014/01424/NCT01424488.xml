	<brief_summary>Primary objective : 1. investigate efficacy sugammadex dose 4 mg/kg administer reappearance T2 reversal pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade subject undergoing abdominal surgery general anesthesia 2. evaluate safety tolerability single dose 4 mg/kg sugammadex administer reappearance T2 reversal pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade Secondary objective : 1. evaluate time start sugammadex placebo administration time extubation time recovery TOF ratio ≥ 0.9 Exploratory objective : 1. evaluate Operating Room ( OR ) Post Anesthetic Care Unit ( PACU ) length stay end surgery subject pipecuronium induce neuromuscular blockade reverse 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex compare placebo ( saline ) 2. compare number patient extubated OR reversal sugammadex placebo , evaluate TOF ratio time extubation Clinical hypothesis : 1 . Sugammadex effective well tolerate reversal pipecuronium-induced blockade</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sugammadex first selective relaxant bind agent indicate reversal rocuronium vecuronium-induced blockade . At time sugammadex able form complex aminosteroid-based muscle relaxant include long acting NMBAs* pancuronium 1,2 . Still limited data efficacy sugammadex pancuronium data efficacy sugammadex aminosteroid-based long act NMBA - pipecuronium still widely use Russia ( well former Soviet Union Countries Eastern Europe country ) . In study evaluate efficacy sugammadex pancuronium show moderate pancuronium-induced blockade effectively reverse less 3 minute sugammadex dose 4.0 mg/kg 3 . In respect would interest study evaluate efficacy sugammadex pipecuronium . It also well know incidence postoperative residual blockade ( complication ) high long act NMBAs pancuronium pipecuronium use 4,5,6,7 . So possibility use sugammadex reversal pipecuronium-induced blockade could help reduce incidence residual blockade relate complication . The effectiveness sugammadex reversal long act NMBAs pipecuronium time would significant light limitation cholinesterase inhibitor . These drug often administer long act NMBAs take account prolong clinical duration action . It expect dose sugammadex 4 mg/kg allow recover TOF ratio 0.9 less 4 min case time similar recovery time moderate pancuronium-induced blockade . *NMBAs-neuromuscular block agent 2.3 Study Design 1 . A single center , randomize , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , safety-assessor ( single ) blind trial 2 . Adult patient undergoing abdominal surgery general anesthesia receive succinylcholine tracheal intubation pipecuronium maintenance neuromuscular blockade . Planned number subject - 42 3 . Patients randomise 2 group receive end surgery 4 mg/kg sugammadex 3 ml saline ( placebo ) reversal pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade . According sample size justification randomization do ratio 1:2 - 14 patient enrolled placebo group 28 patient - sugammadex group 4 . Neuromuscular function monitor use objective neuromuscular monitoring TOF-Watch® SX acceleromyograph adductor pollicis muscle , start induction anesthesia ( succinylcholine pipecuronium administration ) continue least recovery TOF ratio 0.9 5 . The primary efficacy variable time start sugammadex placebo administration ( reappearance T2 ) recovery TOF ratio 0.9 6 . The secondary efficacy variable time start sugammadex placebo administration time extubation 7 . Safety assessment go do order evaluate safety tolerability sugammadex reversal pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade ( analysis AEs vital sign ) Safety variable : - Vital sign , i.e . heart rate blood pressure ( screen , pre-pipecuronium , pre-sugammadex pre-placebo , 2 , 5 , 10 , 30 minute post-sugammadex post-placebo , post-anesthetic visit ) - Physical examination ( screen , post-anesthetic visit ) - Pre-treatment ( serious ) event ( sign inform consent administration sugammadex placebo ) ( serious ) adverse event ( ( S ) AEs , administration sugammadex placebo end trial ) 8 . Descriptive Variables : - Time OR admission ( physical placement subject OR ) actual OR discharge - Time start sugammadex placebo administration actual OR discharge - Time tracheal extubation actual OR PACU discharge - Time PACU admission actual PACU discharge - Number patient extubated OR group</detailed_description>
