	<brief_summary>People chronic low-grade inflammation high risk certain disease cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . While know obese people likely show sign low-grade inflammation lean individual , unclear cause inflammation . In proposed study , investigator examine whether sugar fructose , consume sweetened beverage , trigger low-grade inflammation healthy men woman compare caloric sweetener .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective proposal investigate whether fructose-sweetened beverage trigger low-grade systemic inflammation healthy men woman . Low-grade systemic inflammation , specifically elevate plasma concentration C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . While know obesity associate inflammation , cause low-grade inflammation human well understood . In pilot study , consumption large amount fructose- , glucose- aspartame-sweetened beverage potently induce low-grade inflammation healthy , lean , young men woman little 8 day . The investigator propose extend finding ( ) enrol great number subject , ( b ) enrol obese well non-obese subject , ( c ) include beverage sweeten high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) . HFCS one primary sugar consume United States , major source dietary fructose . Our primary specific aim ass whether consumption fructose- HFCS-sweetened beverage promotes systemic low-grade inflammation , measure plasma concentration CRP IL-6 . The investigator hypothesize plasma CRP IL-6 concentration elevate consumption fructose-containing beverage ( fructose HFCS ) compare glucose-sweetened beverage . Our secondary specific aim ass whether consumption fructose- HFCS-sweetened beverage lower plasma adiponectin concentration . Specifically , investigator hypothesize total high molecular weight ( HMW ) -adiponectin concentration fast plasma low subject consume fructose- HFCS-sweetened beverage , compare glucose-sweetened beverage . The investigator recruit 12 overweight/obese ( BMI 25.0 40 kg/m2 ) 12 normal weight ( BMI 20 24.9 kg/m2 ) men woman free chronic inflammatory metabolic disease . In double-blind , randomize cross-over design , subject complete three 8-day standardized dietary period differ type sweeten beverage administer . Specifically , subject ask drink four serving beverage day sweeten glucose , fructose , HFCS ( 55 % fructose , 45 % glucose ) . All solid food provide three 8-day diet period , consume ad libitum . Following dietary period , investigator collect fast blood measure marker systemic inflammation plasma concentration total HMW-adiponectin . We also assess change adipose tissue inflammation intestinal permeability potential mechanism fructose-sweetened beverage may trigger systemic inflammation . This study potential identify dietary trigger low-grade inflammation , likely contributor CVD metabolic disease . The public health impact project might considerable give consumption fructose population pervasive , modifiable individual well population level .</detailed_description>
