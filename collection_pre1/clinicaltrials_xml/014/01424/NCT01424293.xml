	<brief_summary>Bowel removal indicate various type colon rectal disease , include colon cancer , rectal cancer , diverticulitis , inflammatory bowel disease among others . Following removal diseased segment bowel surgeon reconnect two healthy end reconstruct continuous bowel tube . If bowel leak become extremely dangerous situation . The cause leakage many cause well understood , appear least part due enough blood go bowel . There currently way evaluate blood supply bowel . The purpose study utilize special camera evaluate blood supply bowel . This new system call Spy-scope . This system may assist surgeon reduce occurrence leak</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate whether systemically inject ICG , fluoresce response NIR illumination , assist assessment perfusion bowel anastomotic site . This finding may assist surgeon minimize occurrence leak anastomotic site follow surgical procedure . The present study preliminary investigation determine image modality yield information regard perfusion likely clinically relevant determine large , multi center trial correlate perfusion clinical outcome warrant . The result present study also assist design large scale study . It expect successful outcome trial result less morbidity follow laparoscopic colectomy . Laparoscopic bowel surgery indicate colon cancer , rectal cancer , diverticulitis , inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) infarcted bowel . Prophylactic colectomy also indicate certain form polyposis mitigate risk progression colon cancer . The portion colon resect colectomy dependent upon nature disease location extent . Traditionally , colectomy perform mean laparotomy , standard abdominal incision . In recent year , begin early 1990s , increase interest , utilization , minimally invasive technique surgical procedure involve colon rectum . Laparoscopic surgery involve introduction surgical instrument number ( usually 2-3 ) small incision measure 10-12 mm visual guidance provide mean camera attach endoscope introduce similarly small access port . Laparoscopic technique offer numerous benefit include decrease postoperative pain , improvement time tolerance food return bowel function , short hospital stay rapid return normal activity . Irrespective type procedure perform ( open laparoscopic ) , anastomotic leakage follow colorectal resection primary anastomosis major clinical problem . The incidence intraperitoneal anastomotic leak report literature may high 30 % . Anastomotic leak lead increase length hospital stay , may progress abscess formation , sepsis , multi organ failure even death . The cause anastomotic leakage multifactorial follow factor appear impact upon leakage ; adequacy blood flow anastomosis , contamination , presence pelvic drain , anastomotic tension , anastomotic technique distance anal verge . The present study investigate first factor list , adequacy blood flow anastomosis . At present reliable easy-to-perform modality use assess adequacy perfusion anastomosis colorectal procedure . This study investigate potential SPY scope fill clinical need . The SPYÂ® Intraoperative Imaging System clear use Canada , Japan , Europe US . SPY originally develop application cardiac surgery allow cardiac surgeon visually assess bypass graft quality real-time patient still operate room . Subsequently , SPY receive clearance FDA use plastic reconstructive surgery solid organ transplant . The SPY Intraoperative Imaging System originally develop open surgical procedure use ICG , approve drug . ICG fluorescent compound , administer intravenously intra-arterially . The dye absorbs light near infrared ( NIR ) region 806 nm , emits light slightly longer wavelength , 830 nm . When injected intravenously , ICG rapidly extensively bind plasma protein confine intravascular compartment minimal leakage interstitium normal condition . This property make ideal agent acquisition high quality image vasculature . Intraoperative image acquire first pas bolus ICG area interest . The SPY System subject numerous peer review publication demonstrate safety efficacy . SPY scope , endoscopic version SPY , endoscopic visible ( VIS ) NIR image system consist : - An endoscopic light source provide illumination visible light image NIR fluorescence excitation endoscope via flexible light guide - Rigid endoscope optimize illuminating field view transmit image visible NIR spectrum , - A high definition ( HD ) endoscopic camera system connect endoscope eyepiece acquire high resolution visible NIR fluorescence image The ICG ( 25 mg per vial ) reconstitute accord manufacturer 's instruction use entire content ( 10 ml ) sterile diluent supply , yield 2.5 mg/ml solution ICG use half diluent supply ( 5 ml ) yield 5 mg/ml solution .</detailed_description>
