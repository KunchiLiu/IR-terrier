	<brief_summary>This study seek address question whether intermittent dose rifampicin influence pharmacokinetics raltegravir co-administered . This study aim look happen rifampicin take 3 time week standard dose increase dose raltegravir . This find best dose raltegravir take take rifampicin 3 time week . The study conduct 18 healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Intermittent Rifampicin Raltegravir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study optimise dose raltegravir coadministered intermittently rifampicin . The co-administration rifampicin antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) complicate problematic due potent induction metabolism rifampicin . Rifampicin induce cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes , result reduce plasma concentration two group ARVs , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) . This pharmacokinetic interaction precludes use PIs severely compromise effectiveness NNRTI , nevirapine , potentially result loss antiviral activity due sub-therapeutic concentration also lead antiretroviral resistance . Rifampicin also induce phase II enzymes include UDP-glucuronosyl transferase . The HIV integrase inhibitor , raltegravir , primarily metabolise UGT1A1 therefore , potential pharmacokinetic drug interaction rifampicin . In fact , previous study show decrease raltegravir AUC , CMAX , C12 co-administered daily rifampicin . During directly observe therapy ( DOTs ) TB , rifampicin often give intermittently ( e.g . 3 time week ) . Although several study examine interaction raltegravir daily rifampicin , currently data regard pharmacokinetics raltegravir rifampicin co-administered intermittently .</detailed_description>
