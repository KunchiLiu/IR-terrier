	<brief_summary>Post transplant vasculopathy major negative outcome heart transplantation . Current method detection highly invasive pose risk transplant recipient . Noninvasive marker endothelial function use detect transplant vasculopathy . Endothelial biomarkers : endothelial nitric oxide synthase , vascular cellular adhesion molecule , intracellular adhesion molecule , endothelin-1 , thromboplastin , circulate endothelial cell , uric acid , C-reactive play role pathophysiologic mechanism vasculopathy . Therefore , investigator would like ass association various endothelial biomarkers presence absence transplant vasculopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac transplantation become establish treatment choice eligible patient end-stage heart failure . Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) major potentially preventable limitation long-term survival cardiac transplant recipient . CAV affect 50 % recipient year 5 , though intimal thicken present 58 % one year transplantation . CAV characterize diffuse , concentric intimal hyperplasia , involve epicardial intramyocardial coronary artery . In advanced stage , CAV amenable standard revascularization procedure make cure re-transplantation . Given limited donor pool poor outcome , re-transplantation option patient . CAV tend silent process . Due denervation transplant heart , transplant recipient typically chest pain , thus first symptoms CAV may heart failure sudden cardiac death . Traditional risk factor important predict development CAV , however non-traditional risk factor appear equally important include cellular humoral rejection , graft ischemia time implantation , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . Despite specific incite event , end result endothelial dysfunction , predecessor CAV . Methods detect , prevent , treat endothelial dysfunction subsequently CAV . The rapidity develop , however , affords great opportunity study mechanisms potential intervention relatively short period time . Chronic inflammation immune activation subsequent endothelial injury felt immunopathogenic development CAV . Endothelial activation precursor development transplant vasculopathy , multiple biomarkers show correlate presence endothelial dysfunction transplant vasculopathy . ( fig . 1 ) Endothelial activation , determine presence adhesion molecule , begin hour brain death donor . VCAM-1 , e-selectin , p-selectin express early brain death donor elevate throughout transplantation recipient response injury donor heart . P-selectin VCAM remain elevate e-selectin gradually decrease three month . There data suggest p-selectin VCAM remain elevate 2 year transplantation , suggest persistent inflammation immune activation transplant . Furthermore , nitric oxide principal mediator protective effect endothelium . The nitric oxide pathway essential maintain vascular integrity cardiac recipient , inhibition pathway accelerate intimal thicken worsens endothelial function cause rejection . Intimal thicken marker endothelial dysfunction precursor development CAV . Thus , markers others involve atherogenesis , remodel , immune activation endothelial activation , may provide useful modality predict presence vasculopathy . In addition , study various component process , eg . inflammation injury , provide much need information regard target therapy . Noninvasive assessment peripheral artery function demonstrate correlation coronary artery function useful modality assess risk coronary artery disease . Pulse wave amplitude hyperemic response , use digital tonometry , measure peripheral endothelial function show correlate coronary microvascular function . Abnormalities coronary microcirculation macrocirculation precede development vasculopathy heart transplant recipient . Other measure peripheral endothelial function include arterial elasticity ( measure use CV Profiler , HDI , inc. ) flow-mediated dilatation brachial artery ( FMD ) . These study sensitive noninvasive predictor coronary artery disease , though test widely transplant population . The investigator use study characterize peripheral artery function heart transplant recipient determine whether useful adjunct evaluate patient risk transplant vasculopathy . The ability predict development vasculopathy present provide opportunity intervene escalate modify therapy opportunity possibly prevent CAV , major limitation longevity transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
