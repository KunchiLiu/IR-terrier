	<brief_title>REstrictive Versus LIbEral Fluid Therapy Major Abdominal Surgery : RELIEF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator complete pilot study 82 subject test feasibility trial ( 2011 ) , currently cost-effectiveness substudy ( 2012-13 ) 1 . AIM OF THE TRIAL To investigate effectiveness fluid restriction ( vs. liberal ) , possible effect-modification goal-directed therapy ( eg . oesophageal Doppler , Flotrac® ) . The first randomly assign ; latter measure covariates accord local practice beliefs . The optimal fluid regimen haemodynamic ( ) target patient undergo major surgery base rationale support strong evidence . Practices vary substantially ; guideline vague , small trial meta-analyses contradictory . The strong consistent evidence , biological plausability regard tissue oedema , support restrictive fluid strategy . There less ( contradictory ) evidence support goal-directed therapy use flow-directed device and/or dopexamine , use choice colloid . A large , definitive clinical trial evaluate perioperative fluid replacement major surgery require . Study Hypotheses A restrictive fluid regimen adult undergo major abdominal surgery lead reduce complication improve disability-free survival compare liberal fluid regimen . Secondary hypothesis : The effect fluid restriction similar whether goal-directed therapy use ( assessed statistical test interaction ) . A restrictive fluid regimen reduce composite 30-day septic complication mortality .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Adults ( ≥18 year ) undergo elective major surgery provide informed consent 2 . All type open lapassisted abdominal pelvic surgery expect duration least 2 hour , expect hospital stay least 3 day ( example , oesophagectomy , gastrectomy , pancreatectomy , colectomy , aortic aortofemoral vascular surgery , nephrectomy , cystectomy , open prostatectomy , radical hysterectomy , abdominal incisional hernia repair ) 3 . At increase risk postoperative complication , define least one follow criterion : age ≥70 year know documented history coronary artery disease know documented history heart failure diabetes currently treat oral hypoglycaemic agent and/or insulin preoperative serum creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/L ( &gt; 2.8 mg/dl ) morbid obesity ( BMI ≥35 kg/m² ) preoperative serum albumin &lt; 30 g/L anaerobic threshold ( do ) &lt; 12 mL/kg/min two follow risk factor : ASA 3 4 chronic respiratory disease obesity ( BMI 3035 kg/m² ) aortic peripheral vascular disease preoperative haemoglobin &lt; 100 g/L preoperative serum creatinine 150199 µmol/L ( &gt; 1.7 mg/dl ) anaerobic threshold ( do ) 1214 mL/kg/min Exclusion Criteria 1 . Urgent timecritical surgery 2 . ASA physical status 5 patient expect survive without surgery , underlie illness expect overwhelming effect outcome ( irrespective fluid therapy ) 3 . Chronic renal failure require dialysis 4 . Pulmonary cardiac surgery different pathophysiology , thoracic surgery typically strict fluid restriction 5 . Liver resection unit strict fluid/CVP limit place wo n't allow randomisation 6 . Minor intermediate surgery , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , transurethral resection prostate , inguinal hernia repair , splenectomy , closure colostomy typically `` minor '' surgery minimal IV fluid requirement , generally low rate complication mostly good survival .</criteria>
