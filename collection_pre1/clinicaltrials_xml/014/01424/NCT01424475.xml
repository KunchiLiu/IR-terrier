	<detailed_description>The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) implicate autosomal dominant Parkinson 's disease ( PKD ) . An inhibitor leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) pre-clinical development potential use treat Parkinson 's disease . Patients PKD cognitive impairment develop alongside typical motor symptom full characterisation neurocognitive phenotype PKD patient LRRK2 mutation currently lack . This observational study conduct single visit ass phenotypic neurocognitive abnormality PKD patient LRRK2 mutation aim identify potential PD endpoint related LRRK2 mutation future Phase I II clinical trial LRRK2 inhibitor . Approximately 20 subject PKD bear one know LRRK2 mutation investigate . Approximately 20 healthy subject without LRRK2 mutation match PKD patient also evaluate . Healthy subject expect take medication PKD . Subjects PKD may continue medication PKD treatment throughout study , Testing take place within 30 day screen , depend subject 's availability .</detailed_description>
