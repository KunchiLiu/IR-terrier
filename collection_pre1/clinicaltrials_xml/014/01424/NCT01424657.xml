	<brief_summary>The main objective study assess effectiveness cost magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) compare endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) work patient suspect bile duct obstruction ultrasound . The investigator anticipate universal recommendation give diagnostic test ( MRCP versus ERCP ) applicable patient present bile duct obstruction . Rather , investigator hope provide quantitative comparative data relevant different clinical situation likely encounter practice , order assist physician choose appropriate diagnostic modality . More specifically , investigator feel patient intrahepatic hilar obstruction ( particularly malignant condition ) , partial common bile duct ( CBD ) obstruction ( rule suspect choledocholithiasis ) benefit new technology avoidance unnecessary ERCP determine biliary anatomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography Versus Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Approach Patients With Suspected Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The approach investigation management intermediate-risk biliary obstruction controversial . Both magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) use interchangeably practice , little literature support efficacy one versus . The purpose ass effectiveness MRCP compare ERCP initial work-up patient intermediate risk suspect biliary obstruction follow initial clinical assessment ultrasonography . A randomized medical effectiveness study conduct across three tertiary care hospital site . Patients intermediate risk biliary obstruction randomize either ERCP MRCP base level obstruction see ultrasound ( US ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age great 18 year Elevated bilirubin ( &gt; 30 umol/L ) CBD dilatation ultrasound : great 7 mm wide gallbladder situ , 10mm wide patient postcholecystectomy Suspected detect gallstone ultrasound Low probability biliary tract disease Active cholangitis Biliopancreatic pathology identify ultrasound CT scan Any clinical condition preclude MRCP ERCP : severe cardiorespiratory disease , pregnancy , significant coagulopathy ( INR 1.5 ) Presence RouxenY bilioenteric anastomosis Any metallic implant make ERCP MRCP hazardous ERCP MRCP perform within 6 month prior study inclusion</criteria>
