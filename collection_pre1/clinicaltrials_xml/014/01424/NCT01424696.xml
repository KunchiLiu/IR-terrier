	<brief_title>Baby Observational Nutritional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newborn screening ( NBS ) cystic fibrosis ( CF ) decrease prevalence malnutrition infancy , suboptimal nutrition still persist . In one study , 60 % infant diagnose NBS achieve birth weight percentile two year age , 40 % . The many factor contribute poor growth define persist despite pancreatic enzyme supplementation . Although publish guideline clinical management infant cystic fibrosis U.S. Europe exist , alarm scarcity evidence dictate care . In order proceed large scale randomize study evaluate range intervention infant CF , need develop precise technique measure growth also pursue unexplored factor may contribute poor growth . This multi-center observational clinical study nest interventional PERT sub-study . The observational study design follow prospective manner incident case CF 12 month . The PERT sub-study randomize , double-blind , crossover sub-study design evaluate efficacy safety two dos PERT ( pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy ) improve coefficient fat absorption ( CFA ) stool infant CF . The PERT sub-study unable enroll close . No result available .</detailed_description>
