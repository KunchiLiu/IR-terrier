	<detailed_description>-Study Purpose : The purpose study assess effect IGFI normalization Sandostatin LAR® therapy metabolic abnormality , cardiovascular risk profile body composition patient active acromegaly . -Study Design : This open label , single center , prospective study . Patients active acromegaly receive prior somatostatin analog therapy receive sandostatin LAR® 9 month . Assessments include laboratory testing , intravenous glucose tolerance test , sign symptoms question , cardiac echocardiography ( ECHO ) Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) body composition end 9 month therapy . The primary endpoint analysis change insulin sensitivity , change cardiovascular risk marker , change biochemical marker Growth Hormone ( GH ) /IGF1 axis , change ECHO determine cardiac parameter change body composition increase total body fat decrease lean body mass . - Study Subjects A total 20 subject total site enrol . Subjects recruit base inclusion exclusion criterion protocol patient see Neuroendocrine unit evaluation acromegaly . - Recruitment Method Subjects recruit present Neuroendocrine Unit evaluation acromegaly . Subjects recruit PI approach physician express interest study participation . - Study Procedures Subjects come Neuroendocrine Unit visit monthly study period administration study drug . Patients dose titrate base IGF1 level per study protocol . Patients undergo laboratory testing , physical examination , ECHO , DEXA noninvasive questionnaire monitor specify protocol course study . - Issues Small risk include possible pain bruise site needle insertion blood draw . Sandostatin LAR® associate gastrointestinal side effect bloat diarrhea usually subside . About 15 % patient treated medication develop gallstone . These usually remain asymptomatic . Pituitary tumor may also change size medical therapy .</detailed_description>
