	<brief_summary>This open label , non-randomised [ 11C ] PHNO PET study use healthy male volunteer . Each volunteer undergo 4 [ 11C ] PHNO PET scan allow characterisation radioligand examine effect [ 11C ] PHNO mass carry-over displaceable binding brain . This study aim obtain data 6 evaluable subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A PET Study Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A test-retest ( TRT ) investigation [ 11C ] PHNO human require characterise [ 11C ] PHNO . [ 11C ] PHNO posse high affinity D3 receptor , therefore clinical study conduct D3 occupancy &gt; 10 % . As [ 11C ] PHNO kinetics target brain region moderately slow , considerable mass carry may present 2nd PET scan conduct day . In addition appear significant displaceable bind component cerebellum , , account , lead bias quantification specific [ 11C ] PHNO binding . The aim study therefore examine effect [ 11C ] PHNO mass carry-over displaceable binding cerebellum , quantification [ 11C ] PHNO PET data . This open label , non-randomised [ 11C ] PHNO PET study use healthy volunteer . Each volunteer undergo 4 [ 11C ] PHNO PET scan : 1st 2nd scan ; TRT day minimal gap [ 11C ] PHNO injection examine effect PHNO mass carry , 3rd scan &gt; 1 week later determine `` true '' TRT variability 4th scan follow 15mg dose aripiprazole ( D2/D3 compound allow high clinically acceptable blockade central D2/D3 receptor ) examine amount displaceable binding cerebellum , propose reference tissue [ 11C ] PHNO . The scan data quantify regional volume distribution ( VT ) .</detailed_description>
