	<brief_summary>The objective non-interventional study confirm standard OsvaRen® treatment possible achieve least 60 % patient level phosphorus , total calcium , iPTH see CALMAG study also normal clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-interventional Study Evaluate Ease Reaching Individual Goals Serum Phosphorus ( Steering )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only small fraction haemodialysis patient meet publish NKF-KDOQI standard calcium , phosphorus , calcium x phosphorus product intact parathyroid hormone . One reason still difficult insufficient therapy phosphate binder . Even though calcium contain phosphate binder proven effective , report lead certain patient hypercalcaemia . This observational study therefore evaluate efficacy phosphate binder OsvaRen® ( contain calcium acetate magnesium carbonate ) also frequency untoward event daily practice well state hyper-/ hypoparathyroidism represent serum iPTH value practice pattern use adjust fully exploit quality different available phosphate binder . In addition , compensatory action physician , adaptation dialysate calcium combination non-calcium contain phosphate binder , go monitor . In order receive additional safety data context daily practice , frequency untoward event related treatment document analysed .</detailed_description>
