	<detailed_description>Co-primary Objectives : Determine effectiveness real-time identification administratively uncontrolled asthma real-time outreach administratively optimize National asthma care guideline implementation compare standard KP asthma outreach improve asthma control ( subsequent asthma impairment risk , separately ) . Hypothesis 1 : Real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient compare standard Kaiser Permanente ( KP ) asthma outreach reduce subsequent asthma impairment risk , separately . Hypothesis 2 : Real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient compare standard KP asthma outreach increase proportion patient receive step-up care impairment risk . Hypothesis 3 : The real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient compare standard KP asthma outreach lead increase step-up care reduce subsequent asthma impairment risk . Hypothesis 4 : Specific demographic characteristic ( old age , female gender , non-Hispanic white ethnicity , high census block education/income level ) associate differential response intervention group . Study Objectives : 1 . Determine whether real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient compare standard KP asthma outreach reduce subsequent asthma impairment risk , separately . 2 : Determine whether real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient compare standard KP asthma outreach increase proportion patient receive step-up care impairment risk . 3 : Determine whether real-time notification uncontrolled asthma status asthma specialist patient lead increase step-up care reduce subsequent asthma impairment risk compare standard KP asthma outreach . 4 : Determine whether exist specific demographic characteristic ( old age , female gender , non-Hispanic white ethnicity , high census block education/income level ) associate great differential efficacy intervention group . 5 . Determine exploratory analysis frequency , characteristic ( demographic , asthma severity , prior health care utilization , etc ) clinical outcome ( impairment risk ) patient place omalizumab step-up therapy .</detailed_description>
