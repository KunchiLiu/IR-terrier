	<brief_summary>The purpose study 2-fold : initially , dose escalation phase , goal determine safety profile orally administer AP26113 , include : maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile . Then , RP2D establish , expansion phase assess preliminary anti-tumor activity AP26113 , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ALK gene rearrangement ( include patient active brain metastasis ) mutate EGFR , cancer abnormal target AP26113 active . Approximately 135 175 patient enrol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study Oral ALK/EGFR Inhibitor AP26113</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first assessment AP26113 patient . The trial conduct 2 part : initial dose escalation phase 30 70 patient advanced malignancy ( histology leukemia ) , resistant available therapy standard available curative treatment exist , follow expansion phase 5 histologically molecularly define cohort patient ( approximately 20-25 patient per cohort , approximately 105 patient altogether ) . The objective dose escalation phase determine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile , recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) orally administer AP26113 . The objective expansion phase describe preliminary anti-tumor activity ( overall response rate ) AP26113 patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene rearrangement mutate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , patient cancer abnormality ALK target AP26113 active , continue ass safety tolerability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet criterion cohort entry propose . PART 1 : Dose Escalation Phase : 1 . Histologically confirm advanced malignancy . All histology except leukemia ; 2 . Refractory available therapy standard available curative treatment exist ; 3 . Tumor tissue available analysis ; PART 2 : Expansion cohort ( 5 additional cohort ) : 1 . Expansion cohort 1 : Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient whose tumor exhibit anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement treat previous ALK inhibitor . Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC ; Tumor tissue available analysis ( see General Eligibility Criterion 1 ; History ALK rearrangement fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; No prior ALK inhibitor therapy ; 2 . Expansion cohort 2 : NSCLC patient whose tumor exhibit ALK rearrangement resistant crizotinib : Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC ; Tumor tissue available analysis ( see General Eligibility Criterion 1 ) ; History ALK rearrangement FISH ; Resistant crizotinib ( receive prior ALK inhibitor therapy ) ; 3 . Expansion cohort 3 : NSCLC patient whose tumor exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor EGFRT790M mutation resistant 1 prior EGFR TKI : Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC Previous treatment 1 EGFR TKI last administration within 30 day initiation AP26113 ; Documented evidence EGFRT790M mutation follow disease progression recent EGFR TKI therapy ; No intervene systemic therapy cessation EGFR TKI initiate AP26113 ; Tumor tissue available analysis ( see General Eligibility Criterion 1 ) . 4 . Expansion cohort 4 : Patients cancer abnormality ALK AP26113 target . Examples include , limited , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) , diffuse largecell lymphoma ( DLCL ) , inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor ( IMT ) , cancer ALK abnormality , tumor ROS1 fusion : Histologically confirm lymphoma cancer , exception leukemia ; Tumor tissue available analysis ( see General Eligibility Criterion 1 ) . 5 . Expansion Cohort 5 : NSCLC patient whose tumor exhibit ALK rearrangement active , measurable brain metastasis : Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC : Tumor tissue available analysis ( see General Eligibility Criterion 1 ) ; History ALK rearrangement FISH ; Either crizotinib naive resistant ; Have least one measurable brain lesion ( ≥ 10 mm contrast enhance , T1 weight magnetic resonance image [ cMRI ] ) . Previously treat brain lesion stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) surgical resection include target nontarget lesion ; Previously untreated brain metastasis radiologically document new progress brain lesion . Unequivocal progression previously treat lesion ( nonSRS nonsurgically treated lesion ) least 3 month last treatment ; Neurologically stable . Patients must stable decease dose corticosteroid and/or requirement anticonvulsant 5 day prior baseline MRI 5 day prior initiate AP26113 . General Eligibility Criteria : All patient ( irrespective whether enrolled PART 1 PART 2 ) must meet following eligibility criterion study entry . All patient must tumor tissue available analysis . If sufficient tissue available , patient must undergo biopsy obtain adequate sample . For patient expansion cohort 2 , 3 5 , failure prior therapy specify ( crizotinib cohort 2 5 , one EGFRTKI cohort 3 ) , tumor tissue must available following failure prior therapy . Must measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Male female patient ≥ 18 year old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Minimum life expectancy 3 month . Adequate renal hepatic function . Adequate bone marrow function . Normal QT interval screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) evaluation . For female childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test must document prior enrollment . Female patient childbearing potential fertile male patient must agree use effective form contraception sexual partner throughout study participation . Signed date informed consent indicate patient inform pertinent aspect study . Willingness ability comply schedule visit study procedure . Main Received investigational agent ≤ 14 day prior initiate AP26113 . Received systemic anticancer therapy ( include monoclonal antibody irreversible TKIs afatinib dacomitinib ) radiation therapy ≤ 14 day prior initiate AP26113 . Except reversable TKI ( ie , erlotinib gefitinib ) crizotinib , allow 72 hour prior initiate AP26113 , provide patient free treatmentrelated toxicity might confound safety evaluation AP26113 . Received prior agent target ALK , exception crizotinib , receive 1 prior EGFR TKI . Rechallenge TKI allow . Major surgery within 28 day prior initiate AP26113 . Brain metastases neurologically unstable require anticonvulsant increase dose corticosteroid . Patients previously treat brain metastasis without evidence disease recurrence allow cohort 14 . Patients evaluable nonmeasurable , active brain lesion otherwise meet criterion cohort 5 CNS disease enrol cohort . Significant uncontrolled active cardiovascular disease . Uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure [ BP ] &gt; 100 mm Hg ; systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg ) . Prolonged QT interval , treated medication know cause Torsades de Pointes . History presence pulmonary interstitial disease drugrelated pneumonitis . Ongoing active infection . The requirement intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic consider active infection . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Testing required absence history . Pregnant breastfeeding . Malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal illness could affect oral absorption AP26113 . Any condition illness , opinion Investigator , would compromise patient safety interfere evaluation safety drug . Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis spinal cord compression . In case suspect meningeal involvement , negative lumbar puncture prior study entry require .</criteria>
