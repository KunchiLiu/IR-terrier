	<detailed_description>Sitagliptin , DPP-4 inhibitor use incretin enhancer clinical practice first . In clinical trial , sitagliptin show effective control blood glucose level type 2 diabetes 100 mg daily metformin similar sulfonylurea ( glipizide ) metformin lower HbA1c . Mostly practice , stable blood glucose level maintain change sulfonylurea sitagliptin type 2 diabetes treatment . However , case , abrupt severe hyperglycemia uncontrolled blood glucose level drug change sitagliptin . Several mechanism could consider reduce response DPP-4 inhibitor type 2 diabetes patient . Firstly , significantly reduce secretion glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) expect diabetes functional defect GLP-1 activity could mechanism loss GLP-1 effect irrespective DPP-4 . Secondly , mutation functional defect DPP-4 enzyme could inhibit DPP-4 inhibitor . Thirdly , GLP-1 receptor mutation defect β-cell responsiveness GLP-1 lead reduction response DPP-4 inhibitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetic patient le 15 yr disease duration BMI 2227 kg/m2 HbA1c ≤ 9 % recruitment 1 . Study group After change sulfonylurea sitagliptin case metformin sulfonylurea therapy 1 . Increase fast blood glucose 20 mg/dL postprandial glucose 30 mg/dL within several day 2 . Increase HbA1c 1 % within 23 month without abrupt increase blood glucose level within several day Sulfonylurea dose : less glimepiride 4mg gliclazide 120mg glibenclamide 10mg Metformin dose : 500~2000mg 3 . Reduced response sitagliptin make decision investigator understanding condition patient surely . 2 . Control group Age , sex , BMI match patient condition study patient After change sulfonylurea sitagliptin case metformin plus sulfonylurea therapy , change blood glucose level like stable HbA1c change within 1 % within 23 month Other cause increase blood glucose level except drug change Patients history insulin treatment Patients take thiazolidinediones , alphaglucosidase inhibitor , GLP1 analogue DPP4 inhibitor Patients renal , hepatic dysfunction Patients diabetic complication coronary heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , proliferative diabetic retinopathy diabetic gastroparesis Patients take medication affect glucose level</criteria>
