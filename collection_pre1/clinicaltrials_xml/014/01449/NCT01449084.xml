	<brief_summary>Temporary pancreatic duct stent placement endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) recommend post-endoscopic pancreatitis ( PEP ) prophylaxis high risk patient , include accidental pancreatic duct cannulation occur . However , optimal duration stent placement remain open question . The investigator aim assess immediate stent removal effective prevention PEP accidental pancreatic duct cannulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent meta-analyses randomize controlled trial confirm pancreatic stent placement ERCP reduce risk PEP optimal duration stent placement remain open question . It suggest truly high-risk patient pancreatic stent must leave place minimum 24 hour whereas patient less risk pancreatic duct drainage probably need maintained hour less . Leaving stent place end ERCP procedure carry disadvantage radiological follow-up spontaneous dislodgment occur endoscopic removal deem timely ; moreover , proximal migration report , require endoscopic even surgical removal . There paucity data compare immediate removal spontaneous dislodgment high-risk patient . In one study , significantly high rate PEP detect patient pancreatic stent remove immediately end ERCP procedure stent leave place : unfortunately , patient undergo precut sphincterotomy evaluate study publish abstract form . Therefore , still uncertain whether leave stent place effective immediate removal prevent PEP high-risk patient .</detailed_description>
