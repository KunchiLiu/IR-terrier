	<brief_summary>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) gastrointestinal disorder characterize chronic abdominal pain alter bowel habit absence organic cause . Patients IBS visit doctor frequently , use diagnostic test , consume medication , miss workday , consume overall direct cost patient without IBS . More specific treatment localize symptom IBS therefore need , present study investigate effect mechanisms PPC-5650 . PPC-5650 new chemical entity negatively modulate activity Acid sense ion channel ( ASICs ) . It potent low molecular weight inhibitor class ion channel describe date . It hypothesize safety , efficacy mechanism local administration rectum PPC-5650 evaluate use experimental induce sensation pain rectum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical pain especially visceral pain diffuse widespread , normally associate many autonomic symptom may blur characterization disease clinical practice . When treat clinical pain analgesic effect difficult evaluate due number factor pain intensity . These modifier effect may include complaint relate psychological , cognitive social aspect illness , well systemic reaction . Hence , change factor invariably also interfere pain intensity pain quality bias assessment analgesic clinical trial . Because confounders mention , experimental pain model often advantageous characterize analgesic . Basic mechanism pain perception , transduction central processing also explore mean human experimental pain model . These model , apply healthy volunteer patient , provide important translational link preclinical animal test human clinical trial . In clear contrast clinical pain , experimental pain model allow possibility control duration , intensity nature pain stimulus . As pain multidimensional perception obvious reaction single stimulus certain modality represent limited part pain experience therefore variety stimulus modality require mimic clinical situation . By use multi-modal pain model possible induce sensation pain rectum , investigate safety , effect mechanism drug . This exploratory study investigate effect , mechanisms safety PPC-5650 experimental induce pain patient IBS . The study aim provide data support evaluation PPC-5650 gastrointestinal area .</detailed_description>
