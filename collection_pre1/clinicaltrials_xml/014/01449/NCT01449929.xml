	<brief_summary>This study conduct approximately 468 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) -naïve subject . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive dolutegravir ( DTG ) 50 mg daily ( approximately 234 subject ) darunavir/ritonavir ( DRV/r ) 800 mg/100 mg daily ( approximately 234 subject ) , combination fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) therapy ( either abacavir/lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) tenofovir/emtricitabine ( TDF/FTC ) . Subjects stratify screen HIV-1 RNA background NRTI selection . The primary analysis take place last subject complete 48 week therapy ; additional analysis conduct last subject completes Week 96 study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ING114915 Phase IIIb randomize , open-label , active-controlled , multicentre , parallel group , fully-powered non-inferiority study . The study conduct approximately 468 HIV-1 infect ART-naïve subject . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive DTG 50 mg daily ( approximately 234 subject ) DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg daily ( approximately 234 subject ) , combination fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy ( either ABC/3TC TDF/FTC ) . The primary analysis take place last subject complete 48 week therapy ; additional analysis conduct last subject completes Week 96 study . Subjects fulfil eligibility requirement randomize 1:1 receive DTG 50 mg daily DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg daily . In order achieve balance across two treatment group study , randomization stratify : screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; / 100,000 copies/mL ( c/mL ) &gt; 100,000 c/mL background dual NRTI ( ABC/3TC TDF/FTC ) The DTG DRV/r dose administer open-label fashion throughout study . Subjects randomize receive DTG successfully complete 96 week treatment continue access DTG either locally approve commercially available , patient long derive clinical benefit , patient meet protocol-defined reason discontinuation development DTG terminate . Subjects randomize DRV/r arm receive DRV/r Week 96 visit , discontinue study need make alternative arrangement access antiretroviral medication . All subject receive background dual-NRTI therapy Week 96 visit .</detailed_description>
