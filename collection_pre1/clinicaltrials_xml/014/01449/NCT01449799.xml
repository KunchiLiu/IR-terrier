	<brief_title>An Investigation Pharmacokinetics GSK961081 Fluticasone Propionate Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first time GSK961081 fluticasone propionate administer blend human . In previous clinical study conduct Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient , GSK961081 administer background fluticasone propionate without observed systemic pharmacodynamic interaction . In study GSK961081 fluticasone propionate administer blended formulation single device compare GSK961081 fluticasone propionate administer alone concurrently . The aim study investigate difference pharmacodynamics and/or pharmacokinetics GSK961081 fluticasone propionate administer blend , concurrently alone . Pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic safety information gather assess suitability GSK9610981/fluticasone propionate blend development.Each subject receive four treatment ( GSK961081 alone , fluticasone propionate alone , GSK961081 fluticasone propionate concurrently , GSK961081/fluticasone propionate blend ) randomize order , four treatment period , separate washout period least week . All treatment administer via DISKUS inhaler . Pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics safety assess measurement plasma GSK961081 , plasma fluticasone propionate , serum cortisol , urine cortisol , blood glucose , serum potassium , Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) , heart rate , 12-lead Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , clinical laboratory test collection adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
