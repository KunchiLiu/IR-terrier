	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study determine pair reactivation traumatic memory single administration Rapamycin ( e.g. , Sirolimus ) men combat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder lead reduction emotional strength particular traumatic memory . The following hypothesis test : 1 . Traumatic memory reactivation pair single dose Rapamycin decrease objective measure stress self-report stress replay traumatic memory , relative , subject receive placebo . 2 . Pairing administration Rapamycin traumatic memory reactivation decrease symptom Posttraumatic Stress Disorder one month three month later , relative patient receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapamycin Means Interference With Reconsolidation Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-related Traumatic Memory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) characterize intrusive memory form unwanted image , nightmare , flashback result expose traumatic event . Current research effort begin explore underlying neurochemical change associate PTSD . Recently , effort focus prevention PTSD person expose trauma . For example , preliminary evidence suggest interference consolidation trauma-related memory use beta-antagonist , propranolol , may prevent PTSD human recent trauma . However , give much 90 % US population expose least one traumatic event lifetime , utility treatment limit logistical problem treat everyone risk . To date , systematic study human focus change underlie traumatic memory PTSD establish . The trauma experience initially store short-term memory , consolidated long-term memory . However , long-term stability confer consolidation process undergoes period labiality follow . Each time consolidated memory activate , memory trace become newly labile must consolidate remain long-term memory5 . This process call reconsolidation . Reconsolidation therefore offer biologic window long-term memory disrupt . Preclinical study begin unravel biological change underlie process . Both pharmacological agent , include glucocorticoid , protein synthesis inhibitor interfere memory consolidation reconsolidation . In preclinical study , global protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin block reconsolidation , lead reduction strength traumatic memory . Unfortunately , toxicity anisomycin prohibitive therapeutic use . Thus , rather use global protein synthesis inhibitor , effective selective mean reduce consolidation establish traumatic memory target subset protein translation important synaptic plasticity . The protein kinase mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) regulator subset protein synthesis critical synaptic plasticity .</detailed_description>
