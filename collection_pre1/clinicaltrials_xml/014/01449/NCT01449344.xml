	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety R-HAD Alone Combination With Bortezomib Patients With Relapsed Refractory MCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , multicenter , open-label phase III clinical trial compare efficacy safety Bortezomib combination Rituximab , high-dose Ara-C dexamethasone ( R-HAD ) R-HAD alone patient relapse refractory MCL eligible myeloablative treatment . The primary endpoint time treatment failure ( TTF ) . Secondary endpoint complete response ( CR ) rate , overall response ( CR , PR ) rate , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , progression free survival responder , time next lymphoma treatment , overall survival ( OS ) , safety tolerability Rituximab , high-dose Ara-C dexamethasone alone combination Bortezomib . Study arm compare evaluate impact additional Bortezomib . Study arm also compare historical control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed pathological diagnosis MCL accord WHO classification . Relapse progression follow 1 3 prior line antineoplastic standard therapy . Therapy remission initial induction like intensified chemotherapy stem cell separation follow myeloablative therapy kind maintenance therapy classify one line therapy induction therapy.. If Rituximab part prior treatment , document time progression must least 12 week particular regimen . If highdose AraC part prior treatment , document time progression must least 6 month particular regimen . Patients relapse autologous stem cell transplantation appropriate myeloablative treatment . At least 1 measurable assessable site disease ; case bone marrow infiltration , bone marrow aspiration/ biopsy mandatory stag evaluation . age &gt; 18 year ECOG/WHO Performance Score 02 unless lymphoma relate . The following laboratory value screen , unless lymphoma relate : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1500 cells/microlitre Platelets &gt; = 100,000 cells/microlitre Transaminases ( AST ALT ) &lt; =3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin &lt; =2 x ULN Creatinine &lt; =2 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; =50 mL/min Toxic effect previous therapy surgery resolve NCI CTC grade 2 well . Premenopausal fertile female must agree use highly effective method birth control duration therapy . A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUDs , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . Men must agree father child duration therapy must agree advice female partner use highly effective method birth control . Written informed consent performance studyrelated procedure .

Active malignancy MCL within 5 year Day 1 Cycle 1 , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy . Active systemic infection require treatment . HIV , hepatitis B C Patient &gt; = grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy neuropathic pain define NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . Symptomatic degenerative toxic encephalopathy Serious medical condition ( severe hepatic impairment , pericardial disease , acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease , systemic infection etc ) psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study Female subject pregnant breastfeeding ( pregnancy test mandatory premenopausal woman ) .</criteria>
