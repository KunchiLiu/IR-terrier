	<brief_summary>Ondansetron , also know Zofran , market compound use prevention nausea vomit . This study , call thorough QT study , characterize effect single intravenous ( IV ) dose ondansetron cardiac repolarization compare placebo . Moxifloxacin , commercially available antibiotic know cause mild QT prolongation , use positive control give orally . The cardiac repolarization measure take consecutive ECGs recording device know Holter monitor measure QT interval specify time . In addition , blood sample also take specified time use measure amount study medication body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate Effect Intravenous Ondansetron Cardiac Conduction Compared Placebo Moxifloxacin Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ondansetron first approve 1991 treatment nausea vomit associate chemotherapy surgical procedure ondansetron develop prior current regulatory requirement , formal , thorough QT study perform compound . The purpose study define safety ondansetron effect QT interval prolongation observe member 5-HT3 inhibitor class compound . In case ondansetron , effect rare transient note primarily IV administration , however , extent ondansetron prolongs QT interval define . This study quantify effect single dose IV ondansetron administer 15 minute cardiac conduction double-blind , cross-over study compare placebo positive control , oral moxifloxacin . Pre- post-dose digital electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain continuous Holter monitoring ( 1000 Hz ) blind over-read third party vendor . This double-blind study randomize approximately 60 healthy adult male female volunteer one 12 sequence consist 4 study treatment period crossover design 7-day washout treatment period . Subjects receive placebo , moxifloxacin ( single 400 mg tablet ) , ondansetron 8 mg , ondansetron 32 mg base randomized sequence . Both ondansetron placebo ondansetron administer intravenously 15 minute . Moxifloxacin , drug know cause mild QTc prolongation , include positive control dose open label . Serial blood sample obtain determine ondansetron , need , moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic parameter . Safety tolerability assess physical exam , adverse event , concurrent medication , clinical laboratory test vital sign .</detailed_description>
