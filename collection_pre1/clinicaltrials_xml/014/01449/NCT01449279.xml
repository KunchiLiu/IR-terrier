	<brief_title>Pilot Ipilimumab Stage IV Melanoma Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution , open-label , pilot study palliative radiation therapy ( RT ) combine ipilimumab patient stage IV melanoma . The primary objective study assess safety combine ipilimumab palliative RT patient Stage IV melanoma . Secondary objective ) assess induction anti-melanoma immune response use laboratory correlative study T cell response melanoma antigen , b ) compare tumor response rate duration response unirradiated site responses patient Stage IV disease treat ipilimumab alone expand access study CA184045 . In study , ipilimumab administer recently approve FDA ( 3 mg/kg iv every 3 week total 4 treatment ) . Palliative RT start within 2 day first ipilimumab dose . Patients see least every 12 week follow-up follow completion ipilimumab therapy progression disease image criterion increase symptomatology require another therapy . A total 20 patient previously treat unresectable metastatic melanoma require palliative radiation therapy treat pilot study approximately 18 month . All subject receive study drug monitor safety . Relevant tumor image study obtain baseline , 2-4 week follow 4th/last dose ipilimumab , every 12 week disease progression . This study provide safety data ( possibly early efficacy signal ) need proceed randomize Phase II study proof principle . If compelling data obtain support IT + RT vaccine strategy , approach extend solid tumor type .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Signed Written Informed Consent Before study procedure perform , subject ( legally acceptable representative ) detail study describe , give write informed consent document read . Then , subject consent participate study , indicate consent sign date informed consent document presence study personnel . 2 . Target Population Histologically confirm Stage IV melanoma . Must fail least one systemic therapy malignant melanoma intolerant least one prior systemic treatment . Subjects asymptomatic brain metastasis eligible . ( Systemic steroid avoid possible , subject stable low clinically effective dose , steroid may interfere activity ipilimumab administer time first ipilimumab dose . ) Primary ocular mucosal melanoma allow . Must least 28 day since treatment chemotherapy , biochemotherapy , surgery , radiation , immunotherapy , recover clinically significant toxicity experience treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Life expectancy &gt; = 16 week . Subjects must baseline ( screening/baseline ) radiographic image , ( e.g . brain , chest , abdomen , pelvis , bone scan specific image test determine attend physician ) within 6 week initiation ipilimumab . Required value initial laboratory test : WBC : &gt; = 2000/uL ( ~ 2 x 10^9/L ) ANC : &gt; = 1000/uL ( ~ 1 x 10^9/L ) Platelets : &gt; = 75 x 10^3/uL ( ~ 75 x 10^9/L ) Hemoglobin : &gt; = 9 g/dL ( ~ 80 g/L ; may transfuse ) Creatinine : ~ 2 x ULN AST/ALT : ~ 2.5 x ULN subject without liver metastasis ~ 5 time liver metastasis Bilirubin : ~ 2.0 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. Two measurable site disease ( &gt; = 1.5 cm ) include disease site require palliative radiation therapy well &gt; = 1 disease site outside plan radiation therapy field . 3 . Age Sex Men woman , least 18 year age . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study [ 26 week last dose investigational product ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopausal define : Amenorrhea &gt; = 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start investigational product . c ) Men father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 26 week last dose investigational product ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . 1 . Sex Reproductive Status WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study 8 week last dose investigational product . WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Women positive pregnancy test enrollment investigational product administration . 2 . Target Disease Exceptions Subjects systemic therapy cancer , include experimental treatment . Prior treatment antiCTLA4 antibody treatment failure due AEs . If subject discontinue prior antiCTLA4 treatment due AE SAE , regardless type event , discontinuation constitutes exclusion criterion . If AEs serious enough require subject 's withdrawal prior treatment , subject exclude study . A history AEs prior IL2 Interferon preclude subject enter current study . Subjects relapse study MDX01016 eligible study . 3 . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Autoimmune disease : subject document history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease exclude study subject history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) . Subjects motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre Syndrome Myasthenia Gravis ) exclude study . Any subject lifethreatening condition require highdose immunosuppressant ( ) Presence know hepatitis B hepatitis C infection , regardless control antiviral therapy Subjects melanoma another active , concurrent , malignant disease eligible CA184045 study , exception subject adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . 4 . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate . Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious disease ) illness . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , could make administration ipilimumab hazardous could obscure interpretation adverse event . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious diseases 4 week dose ipilimumab , exception amantadine flumadine . CNS metastases require palliative radiation therapy ; prior brain irradiation allow provide CNS disease stable . 5 . Additional Concomitant Treatments Any investigational agent Any ( nonCA184045 relate ) CTLA4 inhibitor agonists CD137 agonist Immunosuppressive agent ( unless require treat potential AEs ) Chronic systemic corticosteroid ( unless require treating treatment emergent AEs require management sign symptom due brain metastasis , upon discussion BMS medical monitor ) . Eligibility criterion study carefully consider ensure safety study subject ensure result study use . It imperative subject fully meet eligibility criterion .</criteria>
