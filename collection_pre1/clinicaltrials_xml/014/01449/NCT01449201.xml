	<brief_summary>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) often over-expressed , related poor prognosis patient HNSCC . EGFR target strategy show clinical anti-tumor efficacy patient HNSCC . PF-00299804 second-generation quinazoline-based irreversible pan-HER inhibitor . In preclinical study , PF-00299804 much low IC50 value gefitinib cell line engineer express EGFRvIII mutation ( 1.2 nM versus 2,700 nM ) produce tumor growth inhibition gefitinib-resistant xenograft . A phase II trial PF-00299804 patient recurrent metastatic HNSCC currently ongoing preliminary report ASCO 2010 show anti-tumor activity HNSCC . The investigator suggest phase II trial pan-HER inhibitor PF-00299804 patient recurrent metastatic HNSCC previously treat platinum-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
