	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) serious health problem worldwide , particularly southern Chinese population , incidence rate range 15 50 per 100 000 . NPC epithelial malignancy strike racial geographic distribution difference . High incidence rate observe southeast Chinese population , similar rate report people wherever migrate , include Singapore , Taiwan , Hong Kong . This incidence almost 100 fold high white population . The unique feature NPC almost universal association infection Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , first human virus identify involved pathogenesis several malignancy particularly close association NPC , EBV genome detect virtually NPC cell . While radiotherapy first-line treatment NPC , radio-resistance remain significant clinical issue NPC radiotherapy . Thus , unmet medical need discover develop novel radiosensitizers NPC therapy . EBV infection NPC classify type II latent infection EBV nuclear antigen-1 ( EBNA-1 ) , latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP1 ) , LMP2 , EBV early RNA ( EBER ) expression detect . Among protein , LMP1 think play key role pathogenesis NPC . As 60kD integral membrane protein , LMP1 function constitutively active tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) , contribute multiple aspect NPC activate number signal pathway include nuclear factor NF-κB , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , Janus kinase/signal transducer activator transcription ( JAK/STAT ) . Activation NF-kB AP-1 LMP1 link upregulation cellular protein inhibition apoptosis . Depending cell type , expression LMP1 show play different role response biological physiological stimulus . It act primary oncoprotein human cell immortalization also show EBV-coded product transform rodent fibroblast cell line , human epithelial cell keratinocytes . Given critical role viral oncoproteins transformation apoptosis , suppression viral oncoproteins would provide sensible strategy genetically treat NPC . Indeed , antisense oligonucleotides LMP1 EBNA1 show inhibit viral oncoprotein expression , induce apoptosis , sensitize EBV-positive cell cytotoxic agent . Recently , experimental study indicate RNA interference LMP1 exhibit anti-proliferative anti-metastasis effect LMP1 express NPCs . These result suggest EBV-encoded LMP1 may present potential molecular target treatment EBV-associated carcinoma . DNAzymes synthetic , single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides engineer bind complementary sequence target messenger RNA ( mRNA ) Watson-Crick base pair cleave mRNA predetermine phosphodiester linkage . A general model DNAzyme propose , know `` 10-23 '' model . A `` 10-23 '' DNAzyme catalytic domain 15 deoxyribonucleotides , flank two substrate-recognition domain seven nine deoxyribonucleotides arm . In vitro analysis show type DNAzyme could effectively cleave substrate RNA purine : pyrimidine junction physiological condition . These agent use number vitro vivo application inhibit expression target gene dependent gene . Their capacity block development diverse range pathology animal model suggest DNAzymes use therapeutic agent . To develop EBV-LMP1 targeted DNAzymes NPC treatment , show phosphorothioate-modified `` 10-23 '' DNAzymes specifically target LMP1 mRNA could significantly down-regulate expression LMP1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell ( NPC ) affect down-stream pathway activate LMP1 , include NF-κB pathway . It also demonstrate suppression LMP1 expression LMP1-targeted DNAzyme DZ1 could enhance radiosensitivity vivo vitro . Radio-resistance one impediments clinical setting effective cancer therapy , think associate multiple signal pathways different cancer type . ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia mutate ) nuclear 350-kDa protein kinase carboxylterminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase domain [ 1 ] . It function member coordinated system detect DNA break ; arrest cell temporarily G1 , S , G2 checkpoint ; activate DNA repair . Cells lack functional ATM protein show increase sensitivity ionizing radiation ( IR ) genotoxic event . NF-κB ( nuclear factor kappa B ) activate great number gene involve stress response , inflammation , program cell death ( apoptosis ) . P50 homodimers p50/p65 p50/c-Rel heterodimers bind NF-κB DNA bind site promoter region many stress-responsive gene , suggest complex gene physiological regulation network control NF-κB stress response . The elevated basal NF-κB activity certain cancer link tumor resistance chemotherapy radiation . Inhibition NF-κB block adaptive radioresistance . Our study molecular mechanism LMP1-DNAzyme mediate radiosensitization reveal LMP1 activate ATM expression NF-κB pathway inhibition LMP1 expression DNAzyme attenuate bind NF-κB transcription factor ATM promoter . Further evidence show radiosensitivity recover ATM expression knock siRNA NPCs . Together , data support hypothesis provide solid experimental basis use LMP1-targeted DNAzymes potential radiosensitizers treatment EBV-associated carcinoma . Toxicological study mice show morbidity mortality observe dose group course study ( 50mg , 100mg , 200mg/kg ) . All hematological value biochemistry result test hepatic renal function normal . No microscopic lesion could attribute modified DNAzyme oligonucleotide treatment find liver , spleen kidney group . After i.v . administration 100 mg/kg DNAzyme oligonucleotide mouse , peak plasma concentration 24.13±2.6μg/ml achieve . The decrease plasma concentration DNAzyme follow bi-exponential pattern initial distribution half-life ( t1/2α ) 0.18±0.03 h terminal half-life ( t1/2β ) 2.55±1.0 h , area plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) 54.17±9.1μg.h/ml . STUDY DESIGN This study randomize , double-blinded placebo control Phase I/II clinical trial . Forty ( 40 ) patient randomize one two group equal size : placebo group receive saline intra-tumor injection standard radiotherapy ; DZ1 group receive LMP1 DNAzyme ( DZ1 ) standard radiotherapy . The placebo group provide basis assessment safety efficacy DZ1 . Patients receive placebo DZ1 injection two ( 2 ) hour prior radical radiation therapy Monday Thursday seven week . The radical radiotherapy give patient 5 time per week 2 Gy treatment . The entire procedure last seven week . All patient complete study 104 week post-first injection . The patient undergo assessment test every week first seven week , every three month week 8 week 104 . The study include evaluation safety tolerability :</detailed_description>
