	<brief_summary>Malaria major public health problem . 250 million case annually lead approximately 1 million death . Over 80 per cent death occur among African child age five . The main intervention cover treatment Artemisinin Combination Therapies ( ACT ) , long last bednets distribution Rapid Diagnosis Tests ( RDT ) improve malaria diagnosis . This lead Senegal substantial decrease incidence malaria , 2009 . However recent overall decline hide fact malaria incidence remain high south Senegal . That 's Home-based management ( HMM ) malaria introduce select area . Intermittent Preventive Treatment ( IPT ) monthly administration therapeutic dose antimalarial achieve high degree protection attack clinical malaria child . The purpose project evaluate effectiveness combine IPTc HMM southern Senegal The study objective : - Assess tolerance IPTc use SP+AQ administer long period area longer transmission season , - Assess add benefit IPT association Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine + Amodiaquine offer population rapid early care home management malaria already establish . - Determine cost benefit ratio addition IPTc HMM . A cluster randomize control trial design evaluate effectiveness add seasonal IPTc sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine ( SP+AQ ) 5 month per year , villages home-based management malaria implement . All village Saraya district , exclude 7 village health post , eligible participate . Saraya village combine form 24 cluster randomize receive HMM community volunteer , IPTc plus HMM . Trained volunteer Community Medicine Distributors ( CMD ) provide HMM . The primary endpoint incidence clinical malaria fever history fever parasitaemia density least 3000/ul . Secondary outcome include safety , tolerability , coverage acceptability intervention . Both recurrent capital cost health service train staff deliver intervention estimate . Both direct indirect cost user service ( child family ) also assess .</brief_summary>
