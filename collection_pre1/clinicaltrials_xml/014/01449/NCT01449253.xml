	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Different Treatment Regimens Pulmonary Hypertension Secondary Lung Disease Hypoxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , randomize , interventional study indent find efficacy different treatment regimen treatment pulmonary hypertension secondary lung disease and/or hypoxia . It involve 3 arm , one get monotherapy sildenafil 6 month , 2nd get bosentan monotherapy initially 3 month combination sildenafil bosentan 3 month , 3rd get combination sildenafil bosentan begin 6 month . The aim decide best time start combination therapy either start time drug failure . Improvement assess change functional class , pulmonary pressure measure ECHO , pulmonary function test , six minute walk test biochemical marker . Lack randomized trial Indian data subject . Also adverse event serious adverse event closely monitor report ethic committee DCGI immediately .</detailed_description>
