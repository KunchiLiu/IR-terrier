	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) common effective procedure treatment end-staged knee osteoarthritis . Postoperative alignment TKA one important factor effect survival prosthesis . High percentage misalignment report conventional technique use jig base instrument . Several method device establish solve problem . Customized patient match instrument novel technology make magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) low limb . With use special software calculate alignment axis , think accurate alignment achieve use instrument . Therefore , study aim compare accuracy MRI base patient match instrument jig base instrument TKA .</brief_summary>
