	<detailed_description>Sepsis challenge elusive entity high mortality rate . As syndrome , clinician challenge distinguish individual systemic infection warrant intervention low severity patient . Sepsis recognize time-sensitive emergency , patient stand best chance survival effective therapeutic intervention deliver early possible . Recent data show in-hospital disease progression sepsis septic shock associate high risk morbidity mortality shock initial presentation . Yet , even identify treat early aggressive intervention , development septic shock still associate mortality rate 25-40 % . Although presence sustain arterial hypotension serum lactate elevation ( &gt; 4.0 mmol/L ) currently recommend threshold define presence overt shock need aggressive resuscitation , investigator show , patient systemic infection , moderate lactate elevation ( 2.0-3.9 mmol/L ) common occurrence important warning sign increase risk disease progression death . Sepsis elevate lactate 2.0-3.9 , refer `` PRE-SHOCK '' state , identifies population patient at-risk poor outcome . Current guideline sepsis management recommend specific resuscitation measure therapies at-risk population . This study mark first series investigation address PRE-SHOCK population define adverse event within cohort investigate novel intervention improve outcomes . The investigator hypothesize early quantitative resuscitation strategy use protocol-directed IV fluid resuscitation result significant reduction development worsen organ failure ( include shock ) mortality compare standard care .</detailed_description>
