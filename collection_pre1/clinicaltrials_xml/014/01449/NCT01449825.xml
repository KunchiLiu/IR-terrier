	<brief_summary>Pazopanib approve FDA EMA target therapy indication advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Hepatic safety event observe pazopanib pivotal clinical trial U.S. pazopanib label information contain 'black box warn ' regard hepatotoxicity . These clinical observation prompt GSK undertake proactive pharmacovigilance strategy focus hepatic safety go beyond spontaneous report adverse event . The goal study assess prescriber compliance pazopanib label guideline liver monitoring among patient RCC , well quantify characterize hepatic safety profile product real-world clinical practice compare anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) drug . As part regulatory commitment , GSK conduct parallel epidemiologic analyse different patient population represent multiple database electronic medical record . To enhance accrual data , GSK conduct safety surveillance program simultaneously across datasets order detect characterize case liver enzyme elevation diverse population patient receive pazopanib . Two additional goal study evaluate incidence case combination liver enzyme elevation indicative Hy 's Law drug-induced acute liver failure among user pazopanib compare user anti-VEGF drug . This research effort coordinate external coordinating center . An epidemiologic cohort study design , nested several database electronic medical information , employ research question . Following availability pazopanib relevant medical care system , study collect retrospective data regular interval course four year among person expose pazopanib anti-VEGF agent . Each patient characterize base additional available information database ( e.g. , demographic , concomitant medication ) . Elevations liver enzymes identified laboratory data capture database . Potential Hy 's Law acute liver failure case identify establish screen criterion , screen-positive case review adjudication committee hepatologists final determination drug-associated causality .</brief_summary>
