	<detailed_description>The aim proposal accurately assess effect TNP MJ withdrawal symptom across 15 day biochemically confirm MJ abstinence use placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomly assign treatment design , closely monitor potential adverse effect , include change nicotine use dependence . To achieve goal , 116 carefully screen cannabis-dependent individual ( 58 female ) randomly assign one two dos ( 0 mg 7mg nicotine ) TNP ( transdermal nicotine patch ) abstain MJ 15 day . Subjects administer follow-up phone interview 30 day termination treatment assess effect nicotine-patch treatment : 1 ) frequency nicotine tobacco smoke intake , 2 ) Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) -assessed nicotine dependence , 3 ) new use nicotine time since completion study , 4 ) marijuana drug use pattern . Large financial contingency use provide high degree abstinence study completion . This first adequately power study ass effect TNP MJ negative affect-related withdrawal symptom urge use MJ . Withdrawal pattern abstinence assess two group MJ-dependent individual : 1 ) rarely never smoke tobacco , 2 ) smoke four few tobacco cigarette per day ( very-light tobacco smoker ) . A stratified randomization method use control gender tobacco-smoker status . It hypothesize MJ withdrawal symptom less severe group assign 7 mg patch group assign placebo . It also hypothesize individual high anxiety/neuroticism high aggression/hostility exhibit great benefit TNP low trait . Given gender difference observe preliminary study , gender difference predict . The over-the-counter availability , minimal abuse risk , minimal adverse side-effects associate TNP would make ideal highly implementable treatment MJ dependence demonstrate efficacious reduce MJ withdrawal symptom .</detailed_description>
