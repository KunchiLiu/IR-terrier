	<brief_summary>Prevention treatment hypothermia active warm prehospital trauma care recommend scientifical evidence effectiveness clinical set scarce . The objective study evaluate effect additional active warm road air ambulance transportation trauma patient . Patients assign either passive warm blanket passive warm blanket addition active warm intervention use large chemical heat pad apply upper torso . Ear canal temperature , subjective sensation cold discomfort vital sign monitor . Mean core temperature increase 35.1°C ( 95 % CI ; 34.7-35.5 °C ) 36.0°C ( 95 % CI ; 35.7-36.3 °C ) ( p &lt; 0.05 ) patient assign passive warming ( n=22 ) 35.6°C ( 95 % CI ; 35.2-36.0 °C ) 36.4°C ( 95 % CI ; 36.1-36.7°C ) ( p &lt; 0.05 ) patient assign additional active warming ( n=26 ) significant difference group . Cold discomfort decrease 2/3 patient assigned passive warming patient assign additional active warming , difference cold discomfort change statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Patients assign additional active warming also present statistically significant decrease heart rate respiratory frequency ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . In mildly hypothermic trauma patient , preserve shivering capacity , adequate passive warm effective treatment establish slow rewarming rate reduce cold discomfort prehospital transportation . However , addition active warm use chemical heat pad apply torso significantly improve thermal comfort even reduce cold induced stress response .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects sequential trauma patient , age ≥ 18 year , sustain injury outdoors transport one participate EMS unit . Patients exclude initial level consciousness affect , ( Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 15 ) , require prehospital CPR duration transportation expect shorter 10 minute . As aim study investigate effect active warm intervention cold stress patient , patient already receive active warm take indoors 10 minute EMS unit arrival initial cold discomfort rating ≤ 2 also exclude .</criteria>
