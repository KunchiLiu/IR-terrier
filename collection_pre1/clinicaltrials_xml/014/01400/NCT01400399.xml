	<brief_summary>This study evaluate cosmetic outcome examine factor contribute cosmetic outcome woman treat lumpectomy bilateral breast reduction mammoplasty/mastopexy ( BRM ) follow hypofractionated whole breast irradiation . Breast conservation establish method treatment early breast cancer . Because breast conservation essentially cosmetic alternative mastectomy , quality life , cosmetic outcome tumor control important consideration comprehensive treatment planning . Irradiation schemes demonstrate efficacious excellent short term cosmetic outcome . However , interaction currently evolve surgical technique need examine order maintain optimal local control preserve cosmetic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cosmetic Evaluation Lumpectomy Versus Oncolytic Mammoplasty With Bilateral Breast Reduction Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer outcome cosmesis may differ race . Limited controversial data suggest African-American woman worse cosmetic outcome hypofractionated irradiation conventional breast conservation . A grow body data also suggest African-American woman diminish oncologic outcome compare Caucasian woman United States . Further evaluation need well understand reason discrepancy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) invasive ductal , medullary , papillary , colloid ( mucinous ) lobular tubular histology . American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) DCIS Stage T1 T2 , N0 histologically confirm invasive carcinoma breast treat partial mastectomy axillary evaluation appropriate , axillary node dissection sentinel node biopsy ( SLN ) . Patients DCIS without SLN axillary node dissection eligible . Patients great 70 year old , stage 1 disease estrogen/progesterone receptor positive ( ER/PR+ ) , without SLN axillary node dissection also eligible . Partial mastectomy without reconstruction consist local tissue rearrangement and/or reduction mammoplasty ( ipsilateral bilateral ) . Patients undergone surgery and/or chemotherapy prior treatment radiation therapy still eligible enrollment evaluation photograph begin prior radiation . Retrospective Placement least 3 surgical clip lumpectomy cavity strongly encourage . Retrospective data may collect woman complete entire course treatment long formally consent . Unifocal breast cancer may encompass excision single portion breast tissue . Negative inked histologic margin partial mastectomy reexcision specimen confirm prior radiation . Positive margin unacceptable . Every effort make surgeon obtain negative margin initial excision . Negative postpartial mastectomy mammography ( malignancy associate microcalcifications initially present . ) Tamoxifen Arimidex therapy allow . If chemotherapy administer prior radiation ( follow surgery ) , minimum two week must elapse prior start radiation therapy . The patient must 50 year age old . Signed studyspecific inform consent form prior study entry . Patients enrol another clinical trial involve treatment may affect cosmesis bilateral breast . This would include take medication , vitamin supplement , variation radiation surgery topical application breast . Patients node positive . Patients distant metastasis . Palpable radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular internal mammary node , unless histologic confirmation node negative tumor . Any previously treat contralateral breast carcinoma synchronous ipsilateral breast carcinoma . Prior nonhormonal therapy radiation therapy current breast cancer ; prior chemotherapy administer less two week start therapy . Patients Paget 's disease nipple . Patients prior breast reconstructive surgery include breast mastopexy breast augmentation . Patients skin involvement , regardless tumor size . Patients collagenous disease , specifically systemic lupus erythematosis , scleroderma dermatomyositis . Patients severe peripheral vascular disease coronary artery disease ( ex . Previous acute myocardial infarction require stent coronary artery bypass graft within past two year ; prior bypass graft type etc . ) Patients coexist medical condition life expectancy le 5 year . Patients psychiatric disorder would preclude obtain informed consent . Other malignancy except nonmelanomatous skin cancer le 5 year prior participation study ; disease free interval prior carcinoma must continuous . Patients pregnant lactating .</criteria>
