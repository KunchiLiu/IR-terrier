	<detailed_description>There several HIV treatment option person HIV infection yet treat . Most people receive treatment take medication direct good result . This usually determine measure amount HIV blood ( viral load ) . The best response HIV find ( less 50 copies/mL ) blood . However , recently become clear people HIV receive effective HIV drug continue health problem people without HIV infection . Sometimes , damage organ body , include bone , kidney , brain .</detailed_description>
