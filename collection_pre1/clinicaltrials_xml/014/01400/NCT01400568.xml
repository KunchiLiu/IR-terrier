	<brief_summary>This pilot study plan assess suitability low dose Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) inhalation challenge model . As LPS effect base different mode action , challenge model provide possibility test wider spectrum potential drug future . Provided LPS response reproducible , plan test whether single high dose inhale steroid serve positive control LPS model . Another major aim study test variety novel tool non-invasive assessment airway inflammation induce LPS challenge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , airway inflammation induce LPS inhalation . In case neutrophilic airway inflammation safely induce inhaled LPS , LPS challenge repeat . If neutrophil airway inflammation LPS challenge reproducible LPS challenge repeat pre-treatment single high dose inhale fluticasone propionate . To determine airway inflammation , subject ' exhale breath analyze different technique , blood sample well induced sputum collect .</detailed_description>
