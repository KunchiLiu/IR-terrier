	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Selective Cytopheretic Device ( SCD ) Patients With Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury condition kidney capable produce adequate urine . Therefore , another way remove waste body need hopefully allow time kidney heal . One method remove waste body call Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ( CRRT ) variation therapy . This study evaluate safety device connect CRRT tube 7 day . Patients follow day 60 follow treatment .</detailed_description>
