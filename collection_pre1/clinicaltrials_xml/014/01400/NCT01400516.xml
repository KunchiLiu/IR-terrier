	<brief_summary>Summary : The investigator propose randomize controlled open label study teriparatide men woman rheumatoid arthritis joint erosion . Specifically , investigator examine whether teriparatide combination biologic retard development joint erosion . The study conduct Brigham Women 's Hospital Arthritis Center , several Brigham Women 's Hospital Arthritis Center satellite practice , University Massachusetts Medical Center , Massachusetts General Hospital . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize combination teriparatide biologic much effective retard erosion progression biologic alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Teriparatide Joint Erosions Rheumatoid Arthritis : The TERA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Introduction : While generalize osteoporosis cause tremendous disability patient RA occur relatively frequently patient , little research treatment osteoporosis patient RA . Not important question effect teriparatide BMD patient RA , little known might affect localized bone erosion RA disease activity . Recent data mouse model RA suggest intermittent PTH set potent immunosuppressive may indeed heal bone erosion . This study show additive effect PTH addition biologic erosion heal . To best knowledge , yet demonstrate human . That primary aim propose study . II . Objectives Hypotheses : To assess effect teriparatide among group patient RA erosion , use biologics , respect : 1 . Joint erosion volume 3D CT scan ; 2 . Lumbar BMD DXA ; 3 . Hip BMD DXA ; 4 . RA disease activity measure Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) acute phase reactant . The hypothesis test include : 1 . Joint erosion score , measure 3D CT scan , significantly improve study completion patient take teriparatide . 2 . Teriparatide significantly increase BMD site measure DXA . 3 . RA disease activity measure stable study year . III . Statistical Analyses : The total erosion volume calculate hand/wrist six sub-regions : radius , ulna , proximal carpal ( scaphoid , lunate , triquetrum , pisiform ) , distal carpal ( capitate , hamate , trapezium , trapezoid , CMC joint ) , MCP joint , PIP joint . We perform hand level-analysis individual hand study unit . In pre-trial study , reposition reproducibility excellent hand-level ( N = 10 ) note Duryea et al ( REF ) . The average total erosion volume single hand/wrist 428.1 mm3 . Average erosion volume small ulna ( 6.4 mm3 ) large distal carpal ( 144.8mm3 ) . The intra-class correlation ( ICC ) value excellent , range 0.97 1.00 . The root mean square stand deviation ( RMSSD ) 31.2mm3 coefficient variation ( CoV ) 7.3 % . The CoVs six measure hand region range 7.6 % 21.0 % . Individual region increase erosion volume tend correspondingly large RMSSD value , dependence CoV total volume less pronounced . The outcome primary analysis compare change erosion volume baseline follow-up subject receive teriparatide versus . If find change whole hand erosion volume significantly well teriparatide user control , meet primary outcome . In secondary analysis , assess change erosion volume six anatomic site . As secondary analysis , correction multiple test pursue . Significance whole hand anatomic site level base two-tail test significance p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . For analysis , analyze data level hand , adjust within subject correlation two hand use generalized linear mixed model ( GLMM ) . Baseline subject characteristic compare two group use two sample test , Chi-square test non-parametric test applicable . Characteristics interest include age , gender , duration RA , serologic status ( RF positive ACPA positive ) , use oral corticosteroid , use concomitant non-biologic DMARDs , baseline DAS score , baseline Total Sharp Score , baseline HAQ score . If characteristic find imbalanced across group ( p-value &lt; 0.10 ) , variable introduce possible covariates model . However , small study 48 hand , final model include 5 predictor . Several exploratory subgroup analyse pursue . These include subgroup patient base on/with : - Corticosteroid user baseline ; - Less great 2 year RA baseline ; - In RA remission , define three way : DAS28 ≤ 2.6 , SDAI ≤ 3.3 , boolean ( SJC , TJC , patient global CRP ≤ 1 ) ; - hsCRP &lt; 3mg/L versus ≥ 3mg/L ; - Less median # erosion ( base Sharp Score ) versus great ; - Less median erosion volume baseline versus great ; - Depth erosion : 25 % deep erosion versus erosion . The secondary analysis consider exploratory follow analytic strategy primary analysis . Due small size , unadjusted GLMM model use sub-group analysis . Analyses secondary outcome note also consider exploratory . They also follow analytic strategy primary analysis . If follow less complete , estimate effect intention-to-treat . Several miss value technique apply impute miss outcomes include last observation carry forward , single imputation ( e.g . replace miss value sample mean median ) , multiple imputation . Sensitivity analysis compare method complete case analysis . IV . Sample Size Estimates : We use estimate derive pre-trial replication study estimate sample size trial . We consider analysis level subject level individual hand . Assessing individual hand provide twice many observation ( two hand patient ) , observation independent one another . In pilot analysis evaluate 5 patient ( 10 hand ) , log-transformation applied total volume achieve approximately normal distribution . The average value log-transformed total volume 5.32 , standard deviation 1.34 . Assuming reasonable ICC two hands/wrists , patient range 0.20 0.50 , estimate sample size require achieve 80 % power , give range difference significance level 0.050 use two-sided test ( see Table 2 ) 17 . To detect moderate difference 15 % -25 % group , sample size need achieve adequate statistical power would range 10 34 per study group . We recruit 12 patient per group ( 24 hand ) , assume ICC 0.5 .</detailed_description>
