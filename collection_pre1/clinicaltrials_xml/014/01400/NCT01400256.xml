	<brief_summary>The investigator hope show valsartan use safely set acute stroke lower elevate blood pressure . There novel property class drug ( angiotensive-receptor blocker ARB ) , promise human animal data , would suggest drug safely use low blood pressure set acute stroke without compromise brain blood flow ( i.e . cerebral perfusion ) . If proved case , compound could potentially use routinely set , hope improve outcome . This pilot study may pave way large randomize trial look outcome measure stroke patient . Further , positive result pilot study serve proof concept ARBs maintain cerebral perfusion decrease blood pressure , overall favorable property .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Lowering Acute Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer stroke often present hospital elevate blood pressure . Elevated blood pressure set stroke increase risk brain swell bleed brain . Even , concern lower blood pressure medication newly injure part brain may get blood flow need , thereby worsen damage initial stroke . We hope demonstrate drug valsartan use safely modestly low blood pressure acute stroke patient , without detrimental effect brain blood flow neurologic status . Novel MRI technique measure brain blood flow use conjunction clinical scale demonstrate safety . We intend enroll 20 patient ( 10 active drug , 10 placebo ) 16 month period . Patients admit diagnosis acute stroke hypertension eligible study . All patient screen attend physician Stroke Service . Informed consent obtain patient suitable surrogate . Baseline characteristic record include demographic , drug allergy , date time presume stroke , prior stroke history , history hypertension , current blood pressure regimen , cardiovascular risk factor , baseline physical exam , National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score , baseline modify Rankin score . Patients treat examined daily neurologist Stroke Service and/or Neurocritical Care team . A sustained mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 110 ( ~150/90 ) great need inclusion study . Upon admission , per usual protocol , antihypertensive medication withhold . In general , administer antihypertensive agent acute ischemic stroke patient unless blood pressure great ~200/110 ( MAP 140 ) patient sign symptom think secondary elevate blood pressure . Blood pressure take least every four hour , per protocol , either manually automated device . Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) calculate use standard formula ( MAP = diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure ) . Patients admit ICU may arterial line place continuous blood pressure monitoring , need part routine care . Routine blood chemistry , include serum creatinine liver function test draw prior administer drug placebo . At enrollment , patient randomize receive either valsartan placebo . The first dose study medication administer baseline MRI . The patient undergo initial MRI include diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) perfusion-weighted imaging ( PWI ) . The initial MRI standard care stroke patient . After initial MRI , patient give 160 mg dose valsartan placebo , double-blinded fashion . A sustained MAP reduction 15-20 % goal . If MAP remain within 15 % initial value ( prior first MRI scan ) 24 hour first dose valsartan ( placebo ) , patient give 320 mg dose valsartan ( placebo ) remain valsartan 320 mg ( placebo ) daily day 7 , hospital discharge ( whichever sooner ) . If MAP fall 20 % 160 mg ( placebo ) dose , patient switch 80 mg valsartan ( placebo ) day 7 , hospital discharge ( whichever sooner ) . If blood pressure lower 15-20 % ( goal ) , patient remain valsartan 160 mg ( placebo ) daily duration study . A follow-up MRI PWI DWI obtain 48-96 hour initial scan . Additional antihypertensive agent administer follow-up MRI scan unless deem medically indicated attend physician . If additional agent administer , antihypertensive use except ACE inhibitor ARB . Any additional agent need blood pressure control record . The patient continue take valsartan vs. placebo throughout duration his/her hospitalization . At time discharge , NIHSS modify Rankin score record . On hospital day 7 , discharge ( whichever sooner ) , study medication discontinue blood pressure medication discretion treat physician . A 30-day follow-up include assessment modify Rankin score Glasgow Outcome Score . This 30 day follow-up conduct telephone unless patient come clinic routine hospital follow-up visit . The patient undergo two brain MRIs initial hospitalization , require scan time approximately 45 minute . Standard sequence obtain , include DWI PWI .</detailed_description>
