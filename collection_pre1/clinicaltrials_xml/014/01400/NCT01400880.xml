	<brief_title>Electrode-based Sensor Non-invasive Fetal Heart Rate EMG Monitoring With Improved Reliability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority obstetric delivery US undergo electronic monitoring continuous uterine activity fetal heart rate ( FHR ) monitor standard care . Typically , external transducer employ , reliability depend proper positioning , may disturb patient fetal movement . The tocodynamometer ( strain gauge , toco short ) provide frequency time contraction , require transmission tension uterus sensor . Fetal heart rate acquire external Doppler ultrasound transducer . The reliability monitor depend ability obtain window fetal heart . In patient , particularly obese , toco ultrasound may fail monitor consistently . In others transducer require frequent reposition nursing staff , Doppler may erroneously report maternal heart rate instead fetal . The alternative uterine activity monitor intrauterine pressure catheter ( IUPC ) , place cervical o adequately dilate patient ruptured membrane . While monitor usually provide reliable signal toco , well quantitative information regard intrauterine pressure , invasive increase risk infection . The alternative FHR monitor via fetal scalp electrode ( FSE ) , apply transvaginally fetal present part , also require adequate cervical dilation rupture membrane . While FSE usually provide reliable signal , similarly invasive increase risk infection .</detailed_description>
