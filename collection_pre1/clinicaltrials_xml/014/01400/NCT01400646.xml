	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore pharmacodynamic ( drug body ) change transition rivaroxaban 20 mg daily warfarin dose therapeutic level measure International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) range 2.0 3.0 healthy volunteer . In addition , pharmacokinetics ( body drug ) , safety tolerability rivaroxaban transition warfarin investigate . The INR obtain blood test , measure clot tendency blood use safe adequate dosing warfarin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Explore Pharmacodynamic Changes When Transitioning From Rivaroxaban Warfarin Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label ( study staff healthy volunteer know identity treatment assign ) , sequential 2-treatment period study healthy adult volunteer explore pharmacodynamic change ( change drug body ) , specifically regard blood coagulation ( blood clot ) healthy volunteer take oral ( mouth ) rivaroxaban follow warfarin . Treatment Period 1 : Rivaroxaban 20 mg/day 5 day Rivaoxaban 20 mg/day + Warfarin 10 mg/day 2-4 day warfarin 0-15 mg/day 4 day . Treatment Period 2 : Warfarin 10 mg/day 2-4 day , 0-15 mg/day 4 day . Treatment period 1 2 separate washout period least 14 day . In Treatment Periods 1 2 , dose warfarin may adjust specify protocol last dose warfarin Treatment period follow single dose Vitamin K. The approximate total study length healthy adult volunteer enrol approximately 72 day ( include 28-day Screening Period , 30-day Open-label Treatment Phase , include 7 day follow-up visit , least 14-day washout treatment period ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Volunteers must agree provide blood sample pharmacogenomic testing must less 3 variant CYP2C9 VKORC1 gene allele associate increase warfarin sensitivity genetic status regard allele previously know Have coagulation test result ( INR , PT , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within clinically acceptable limit , blood pressure ( volunteer supine 5 minute ) 90 140 mmHg systolic , inclusive , 50 90 mmHg diastolic Have body mass index ( BMI ) 18 30 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) , body weight less 50 kg Be Nonsmoker ( Volunteers may use nicotinecontaining product within 3 month prior study drug administration Have history current clinically significant medical illness , include ( limited ) intracranial tumor aneurysm Have history gastrointestinal disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease ) could result impaired absorption study drug history clinically significant hemoptysis , excessive bruising , bleed nose gum know disorder increase bleed risk ( e.g. , acute gastritis , acute peptic ulcer ) history bleed diathesis . Concomitant use ( also within last 2 week start study ) drug influence coagulation system , e.g. , antiplatelet drug ( e.g. , acetylsalicylic acid , ticlopidine clopidogrel abciximab , tirofiban integrelin ) anticoagulant ( antithrombins , unfractionated heparin , low molecular weight heparin hirudin , coumadintype anticoagulant phenprocoumon , warfarin , dabigatran , probenecide ) Use medication know affect metabolic pathway ( CYP3A4 , Pgp ) within 14 day study admission</criteria>
