	<brief_summary>This study compare absolute relative effectiveness asthma management patient inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) maintenance therapy either extra-fine-particle larger-particle formulation beclomethasone dipropionate ( BDP ) via metered-dose inhaler ( MDIs ) use propellant hydrofluoroalkane propellant ( HFA-BDP ) , namely Qvar® MDI compare Clenil® MDI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qvar Versus Clenil , General Practice Research Database Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline UK underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent le 10 % UK 's asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There , therefore , need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . In response Montreal Protocol 's ruling phase ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) propellants asthma inhaler , several hydrofluoroalkane-134a-propellant ( HFA- ) formulation BDP develop . Two brand generic formulation currently available UK Qvar® ( Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ) - extra-fine-particle ( ~1.1 micron ) HFA-BDP ( solution ) formulation Clenil® ( Chiesi Limited ) - large particle ( ~2.9 micron ) HFA-BDP ( suspension ) formulation . The extra-fine particle formulation HFA-BDP formulation ( Qvar® ) show improve total small airway deposition relative CFC-BDP . As result even distribution large small airway lung data short-term randomised clinical trial ( RCTs ) , Qvar® dose recommend approximately one half dose traditional CFC-BDP ( average particle size ~3.5 micron ) . However , larger-particle Clenil® recommend prescribe dose traditional CFC-BDP . Further study require understand whether difference particle size airway distribution impact asthma outcomes long-term . This observational study investigate real-world effectiveness extra-fine HFA-BDP ( Qvar® ) compare larger-particle HFA-BDP ( Clenil® ) patient asthma : new ICS therapy ; receive increase ICS dose , switch / change baseline ICS therapy HFA-BDP change BDP-equivalent ICS dose . We hypothesise difference effectiveness might become apparent long term retrospective database analysis one-year outcome diverse patient population see primary care .</detailed_description>
