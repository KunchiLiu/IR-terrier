	<detailed_description>Coffee contributes large extent daily intake phenolic compound associate potential health benefit . A study Richelle et al . ( 2001 ) , use LDL oxidation assay , show phenolic compound coffee possess antioxidant activity vary depend coffee bean source degree roast . Little known bioavailability phenolic compound coffee various roast level . Therefore , human study require order demonstrate absorption , bioavailability metabolite may also efficient vivo . The main objective clinical trial investigate possible difference bioavailability chlorogenic phenolic acid coffee different roast level . After medical examination approval , subject randomly assign one four coffee treatment . Each study period correspond ingestion one treatment study period separate one week washout period . Blood take time course 24h urine collect 30h . Investigators also blind respect dose treatment give subject .</detailed_description>
