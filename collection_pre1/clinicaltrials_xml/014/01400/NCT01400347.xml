	<detailed_description>It generally accept effectiveness exercise control weight resistance apply also exercise would better target desired muscle . Information regard select low extremity muscle activity specific exercise influence fatigue speed muscular activation may enhance exercise prescription party involve . Specifically , selection specific train rehabilitation exercise may guide increase awareness specific muscle activation pattern common exercise . Methods Measures : Healthy subject 18 - 35 year old recruit community sample convenience word mouth . Potential participant report Institute Human Performance . The potential participant ask complete documentation include informed consent , health screening questionnaire . The qualified participant familiarize set specific exercise . If eligible , surface EMG recording collect back extensor , gluteal muscle ( buttock ) , hamstring ( posterior thigh ) , quadriceps ( anterior thigh ) , gastrocnemius ( calf ) squat lunge exercise . For data analysis , within subject measure analysis conduct use general linear model . Specifically , use pair t-tests analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . When applicable , post-hoc test use uncover difference among group subject descriptor variable age , height , weight , rate perceive exertion , maximal sub-maximal voluntary muscle performance variable ( i.e . EMG amplitude , frequency ) . The statistical significance level set alpha = 0.05 analysis perform .</detailed_description>
