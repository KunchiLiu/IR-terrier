	<brief_summary>Promising result intra-arrest cooling neurological intact survival cardiac arrest patient recently publish PRINCE-study Circulation 2010 . The main purpose study determine whether prehospital intra-nasal cooling initiate resuscitation , addition systemic cooling hospital , increase neurological intact survival measure cerebral performance category score ( CPC-score ) 90 day witness cardiac arrest outside hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prehospital Resuscitation Intra Nasal Cooling Effectiveness Survival Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The RhinoChill Device non-invasive , portable cool device rapid cool achieve via trans-nasal delivery evaporative coolant nasopharynx . Animal study suggest life-saving benefit intra-arrest cooling . Results European multicenter randomize trial ( PRINCE - Pre Rosc Intra Nasal Cooling Effectiveness ) , publish Circulation August 2010 , demonstrate intra-arrest trans-nasal evaporative cooling use safely effectively prehospital cardiac arrest without interfere advanced cardiac life support protocol . The outcome result among patient admit hospital show trend towards improve survival hospital discharge treatment group ( 43.8 % versus 31.0 , p=0.26 ) . The difference neurologically intact survival 34.4 % vs 21.4 % ) . In subgroup patient cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) start Emergency Medical Services personnel within 10 minute ( 78 % total number patient ) difference total survival group ( 56.5 versus 29.4 , p=0.03 ) . Neurologically intact survival correspond subgroup 43.5 % vs 17.6 % . In treatment group , time tympanic temperature 34º reach 3 hour faster ( 102 min versus 291 min , p=0.03 ) time core temperature 2 hour faster ( 155 min versus 284 min , p=0.13 ) . This study power detect clinically significant change neurologically intact survival 90 day cardiac arrest . An interim analysis safety futility perform external committee first 200 patient provide endpoint data . Conditional power meeting primary endpoint need , computed time , interim result correspond primary endpoint , termination study futility consider . Early stop efficacy reason consider major outcome difference see group accord Haybittle rule p-value ≤0,001 . Intention treat per protocol analysis perform randomized patient . No imputed value use patient data available . Stratified analyse performed patient whose first record rhythm VF/VT versus first record rhythm PEA asystole . Stratification analyse perform subject CPR initiate within 10 minute first responder . Stratified analyse also perform subject treatment group cool start within 15 minute . Besides specific endpoint list , substudies make ass follow specific endpoint : - Prehospital trans-nasal cooling significantly improve systolic leave ventricular function measure LVEF ( perform Echo ) . - Prehospital trans-nasal cool significantly reduce infarction size area risk increase systolic leave ventricular function measure LVEF ( ECHO MRI ) patient AMI cause cardiac arrest . - Prehospital trans-nasal cool significantly reduce in-hospital MACE ( Major Adverse Cardiac Events ) ( i.e . death , reinfarction , stroke , cardiogenic shock , pulmonary oedema , recurrent cardiac arrest need for.IABP.during hospital stay ) - Prehospital trans-nasal cooling significantly reduce proportion patient cardiogenic shock - Prehospital trans-nasal cool significantly reduce day ventilator , day ICU length stay hospital among survivor . - To perform metaanalysis regard ROSC , early late survival pool analysis PRINCE data PRINCESS 200 patientdata . - Prehospital trans-nasal cooling significantly reduce peak-value biochemical marker patient treat RhinoChill 25 % ( measure 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 72 hour ) . - To assess development end tidal CO2 resuscitation patient cool prehospital wit trans nasal cool</detailed_description>
