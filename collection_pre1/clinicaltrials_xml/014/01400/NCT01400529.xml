	<brief_title>Etude 3000 ARTHROSES Symptomatic Knee Hip Osteoarthritis Prevalence Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) degenerative disease progressively affect joint cartilage subchondral bone , lead pain , limited range motion functional impairment . Knee hip frequently affect joint . There treatment able cure OA least slow cartilage damage . Thus , symptomatic treatment become ineffective , joint prosthetic replacement unique solution . There substantial lack information osteoarthritis ( OA ) epidemiology France , well European country , becomes critical population age . The need additional knowledge outline law public health priority France , publish August 9th , 2004 . In document , specific call make additional investigation functional limitation , disability quality life modification people affect OA . Up , available information mainly limit short- medium-term study , conduct clinic-based sample . Thus , base demography public health conclusion , implement population-based epidemiologic study require order improve scientific knowledge regard : - prevalence symptomatic OA , - natural history year potential prognostic factor influence disease , - impact term quality life change , disability , lack autonomy health resource use . Our expert group , substantial experience osteoarthritis , epidemiology health service research , develop 2-part research program aiming help answer OA-related public health question : - Part 1 : nationwide descriptive epidemiology survey aim determine low limb OA prevalence , base validated method previously use assess inflammatory rheumatism ( rheumatoid arthritis spondylarthropathy ) prevalence France . - Part 2 : constitution population-based cohort OA patient , aim collect clinical , biologic radiological data OA natural history , predictor structural progression , consequence quality life , function health resource use . The present study part 1 program</detailed_description>
