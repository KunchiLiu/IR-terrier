	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) much common elderly young ; late study show prevalence 45 % 62 % individual 60 . It even higher patient dementia Alzheimer patient . Several trial elderly patient show modified cognitive function , particularly executive attentional function , patient respiratory sleep disorder . However benefit CPAP ( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ) ventilation Alzheimer patient still controversial , study document effect dementia patient ' cognitive ability , clinician appear reluctant prescribe type treatment . The investigator must keep mind Alzheimer patient suffer significant sleep disorder ; advanced- stage patient spend 40 % night awake drowsy large part day . In dementia patient , sleep disorder major cause hospitalization institutionalization . The prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) population estimate 50 % , appear high advanced dementia . Trials obstructive sleep apnea syndrome Alzheimer patient show significatively improve score apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , well satisfactory treatment tolerance . However , impact cognitive ability yet demonstrate . In addition , cardiovascular pathology arterial hypertension , cardiac arrhythmia , stroke strongly correlate OSA . In light consequence morbidity mortality , OSA consider public health issue . In context , investigator wish address impact CPAP treatment implementation cognitive parameter patient diagnose OSA , particularly executive function . This provide evidence mid-term assessment benefit CPAP care elderly patient dementia . In light prevalence obstructive sleep pathology elderly patient report various study potential impact CPAP treatment cognitive ability , investigator propose study evaluate impact OSA treatment elderly Alzheimer patient ' cognitive ability , particularly executive function . Executive function rather heterogenous group high-level cognitive process enable individual adopt flexible , context-appropriate behavior . They also include plan ability , work memory , cognitive control , abstract thought , rule learning , selective attention , motor response selection , etc ... Executive function mainly associate function brain 's frontal lobe , although subcortical structure also play role . When executive function affect disease , daily life significantly impede individual becomes unable perform complex task regulate his/her behavior . Many test help evaluate function dementia patient . A number `` ecological '' test , zoo map test Behavioural Assessment Dysexecutive Syndrome ( BADS ) arsenal , quite relevant evaluate executive function . This project aim improve daily life Alzheimer patient sleep apnea improve executive cognitive function CPAP treatment . According Paquid 's trial , 12,400 Alzheimer patient French Loire department . [ 27 ] The study population therefore recruit `` La Charité '' center CHU Saint-Etienne . The target population old individual ( ≥ 65 ) suffer cognitive disorder similar Alzheimer 's disease . OSA diagnose base polysomnography , outpatient basis . Apnea patient receive CPAP treatment 4 month , minimum duration require implement accept treatment , measure impact patient ' neurocognitive ability .</brief_summary>
