	<brief_summary>This pilot/feasibility study . The study design represent modification current standard care Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ( DIPG ) ( 5580 cGY involve field radiation ) , final two dos radiation give interval vaccination phase treatment . Patients age 3 year 25 year diagnose Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ( DIPG ) allow participate trial . Study enrollment occur completion conformal radiation therapy dose 5580 cGy post radiation therapy ( RT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) show disease progression . Three patient glioblastoma multiforme , age 16 year old , enter first confirm vaccine safety enrol DIPG patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imiquimod/Brain Tumor Initiating Cell ( BTIC ) Vaccine Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccine produce University Of Minnesota Molecular Cellular Therapeutics Facility use establish brain tumor initiate cell ( BTIC ) cell line GBM-6 antigen source . Vaccine administration begin four week ( week 10 ) follow completion radiation therapy give every two week four dos . At time 1st 3rd vaccination , additional 180 cGy fraction deliver single dos novel effort induce NKG2D ligand upregulation ( thereby `` sensitize '' residual tumor lymphocyte attack ) . The total radiation dose patient 5940 cGy . Subsequent vaccination give every four week continue maximum one year study enrollment , time median survival pass base historical data . Imaging obtain study entry ( post radiation therapy ) every eight week thereafter eighteen month , time interval image follow-up episode determine patient 's clinical status . Imaging include MRI brain use current institutional brain tumor image protocol . Imaging also include SPECT/MRI perfusion MRI . FDG-PET imaging may use certain case differentiate tumor necrosis progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Age 16 year old patient histologically confirm glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade IIIIV recurrent progressive disease standard therapy ( enrollment plan 1 ) . Age 3 year old patient diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) diagnose magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Completion standard radiation therapy ( exceed 5580 cGy ) post radiation therapy ( RT ) MRI show disease progression compare preRT MRI . All patient must treat Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) equivalent conformal technique . Patients outside institution refer start radiation therapy may complete initial radiation therapy home institution long dosage guideline meet total dose exceed 5580 cGy time study registration ( enrollment plan 2 3 ) . patient regardless diagnosis must clinically stable low dose ( 0.1 mg/kg/day , maximum 4 mg/day dexamethasone ) corticosteroid least 1 week prior study enrollment . Pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnancy test perform menstruate female within 14 day prior study enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Currently receive chemotherapy , investigational agent registration another therapy base trial receive chemotherapy radiation therapy History immune system abnormalities hyperimmunity ( e.g. , autoimmune disease ) hypoimmunity ( e.g. , myelodysplastic disorder , marrow failure , AIDS , ongoing pregnancy , transplant immunosuppression ) Any isolated laboratory abnormality suggestive serious autoimmune disease Any condition could potentially alter immune function ( AIDS , multiple sclerosis , diabetes , renal failure ) Receiving ongoing treatment immunosuppressive drug , exclude patient require dexamethasone treatment tumorrelated edema</criteria>
