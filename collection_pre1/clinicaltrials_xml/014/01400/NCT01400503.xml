	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Long-term Treatment With Siltuximab Patients With Multicentric Castleman 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , non-randomized ( patient assign chance treatment group ) , Phase 2b study . Up 75 patient MCD eligible study , majority active therapy siltuximab time enrollment . Patients either siltuximab-naive progressed siltuximab opinion investigator . Duration disease control survival assess . Data collection patient discontinue treatment limited survival , occurrence malignancy , subsequent therapy MCD , assess twice per year patient lose follow withdrawn consent study , whichever occur first . An interim analysis conduct ( later 2 year start enrollment ) evaluate benefit safety long-term treatment siltuximab patient MCD . A data occur 6 year start enrollment patient remain treatment data cutoff , data collection limit pregnancy serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , include information study agent administration concomitant medication associate SAE . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination perform throughout study . The end study date last assessment last patient .</detailed_description>
