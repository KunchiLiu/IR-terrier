	<brief_summary>People asthma suffer breathlessness small tube ( bronchiole ) carry air lung become inflamed narrow . Steroids reduce inflammation , commonly use control asthma , work well asthmatic , particularly smoke . This study do find smoker asthma benefit steroid treatment . In study , effect Flixotide ( fluticasone propionate ) , steroid widely use treat asthma , test smoker non-smokers mild asthma . 16 smoker 16 non-smokers , age 18−55 year enrol study . Subjects take follow treatment : - 100 microgram Flixotide twice daily 7 day ; - 500 microgram Flixotide twice daily 7 day ; - placebo ( dummy medicine ) twice daily 7 day . Study design : subject screen visit ( 2 day ) , take part 3 treatment period ( separate interval least 14 day ) ; follow-up visit schedule 7 day last intake study treatment . The order order subject take treatment define random . Total study duration : 11 week . To test effect Flixotide , subject 's response : - inhale allergen test - PC20 methacholine test - blood , urine sputum PD marker analyse . This study take place 2 centre : 1 United Kingdom 1 Belgium . The unit recruit participant advertising ( newspaper , radio , website ) , word mouth , volunteer database , via centre ' website .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhalation Corticosteroids Smoking Non-smoking Asthmatics .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient asthma successfully treat inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy , either alone combination long-acting beta 2-agonists , minimal side effect . However , significant proportion asthmatic patient , include present cigarette smoker former cigarette smoker , fail respond well ICS , alone combination therapy . In randomized , placebo-controlled study , efficacy inhale fluticasone propionate ( FP ) , 1000 μg/day peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) bronchial hyper-reactivity smoker mild asthma assess compare non-smoking asthmatic . Asthmatics smoke show impaired response ICS therapy compare non-smoking asthmatic [ Chalmers , 2002 ] lack responsiveness appear dose-dependent . When dose ICS increase , disparity lung function , rescue inhaler usage asthma control see smoker non-smokers decrease [ Tomlinson , 2005 ] . Interestingly , smoking also affect ability ICS suppress exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) level asthmatic [ Horváth , 2004 ] . Smoking cessation improve basal lung function require least year demonstrate improvement Glucocorticoid ( GC ) responsiveness respect morning peak expiratory flow , FEV1 , therapy high-dose oral prednisolone [ Chaudhuri , 2006 ] . Smoking asthmatic severe disease require therapy , hospital admission likely die asthma [ Thomson , 2005 ] . Cigarette smoking remain therefore one commonest cause steroid resistance asthma , however many aspect development restoration corticosteroid resistance remain unclarified population partly due paucity study perform . The mechanisms underlying GC resistance smoking asthmatic incompletely understood think include noneosinophilic ( often neutrophilic ) airway inflammation [ Chalmers , 2001 ] , impaired corticosteroid receptor function , and/or reduce histone deacetylase activity [ Adcock , 2008 ] . In support effect smoke asthma , animal model show smoking increase inflammation allergic model asthma affect steroid responsiveness . Tobacco smoke exposure ( 4 cigarettes/day 3weeks ) small neutrophilic effect mouse , whereas ovalbumin exposure inflammatory effect airway , increase allergen-specific IgE [ Moerloose , 2006 ] . More recently mouse model , cigarette smoke show enhance T-helper- ( TH ) 2-driven airway inflammation [ Van Hove , 2008 ] . Inhaled allergen important trigger exacerbation asthma [ Johnston , 2006 ] . The airway inflammation induce inhaled allergen , effect drug airway inflammation , study use experimental allergen challenge model . All currently approve drug use treat asthma modify , way , allergen-induced airway response . Following inhalation appropriate allergen extract , sensitive subject , i.e . atopic-asthmatics , develop acute bronchoconstriction peak 20 30 minute post-allergen last approximately two hour recovery . This early response ( EAR ) reflect mast cell activation subsequent release mainly spasmogenic mediator correlate extent airway inflammation disease activity [ Grzelewska-Rsymowska , 1995 ] . In approximately 50 % patient , EAR follow late-phase asthmatic response ( LAR ) . This prolonged airway narrow associate influx activate inflammatory cell , especially eosinophils , airways represent chronic feature asthma , consist prolonged airway narrow bronchospasm airway inflammation . The sequela LAR last several day 3 week . Also , late response show associated increase airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) stimulus , methacholine several day allergen challenge [ Hansel , 2002 ] . This clinically relevant model allergic bronchoconstriction useful human explore time-course cellular inflammation associate physiological change , particularly relate eosinophil , basophil dendritic cell [ O'Byrne , 2009 ] .In non smoking asthmatic , regular treatment inhale corticosteroid show attenuate early allergic response , perhaps reduce number mast cell airways [ Gauvreau , 2000 ] improve late-phase asthmatic response [ Kidney , 1997 ; Cockcroft , 1987 ] . As previous allergen challenge study therapeutic intervention conduct population non-smokers , study first examine allergen challenge response FP smoking asthmatic . The primary endpoint study degree attenuation late-phase asthmatic response .</detailed_description>
