	<brief_summary>Patent ductus arterioses ( PDA ) major morbidity preterm infant , especially extremely premature infant le 28 week . The clinical sign symptom PDA preterm infant non specific insensitive make early diagnosis significant ductal shunting . Functional echocardiography emerge new valuable bedside tool early diagnosis hemodynamically significant ductus , even though universally accept criterion grade hemodynamic significance . Echocardiography also use early target treatment ductus arterioses , though long term benefit strategy debatable . The biomarkers like BNP N- terminal pro-BNP currently research diagnostic marker PDA . The primary mode treatment PDA pharmacological closure use cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor closure rate 70-80 % . Oral ibuprofen emerge well alternative especially Indian scenario parenteral preparation indomethacin unavailable side effect comparatively lesser . Though pharmacological closure PDA establish treatment modality , still lack evidence long term benefit therapy well evidence possible adverse effect like increase ROP BPD rate , especially treat prophylactically.The aim study investigate effect oral ibuprofen prophylaxis administrate first 24 hour life follow two day hemodynamically significant patent ductus arterioses long term effect ROP BPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patent ductus arterioses ( PDA ) major morbidity encounter preterm neonate , especially baby less 28 week gestation 1000g.Natural ductal closure inversely related gestational age birth weight . The incidence range 15 % 37 % newborn baby less 1750 grams.The presence PDA significant effect myocardial function well systemic pulmonary blood flow . Preterm newborns adapt , increase leave ventricular contractility , thereby maintain effective systemic blood flow even leave right shunt equal 50 % leave ventricular output . This mainly accomplished increase stroke volume ( SV ) rather heart rate.This increase stroke volume primarily due reduction afterload simultaneous increase leave ventricular preload . An increase number biological substance like hormone , enzymes marker cardiac stress , dysfunction myocardial injury-collectively call biomarkers-are emerge diagnostic prognostic marker especially set heart failure ischemic injury . The pharmacological basis medical therapy use non selective cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) inhibitor , inhibits prostaglandin synthesis cause ductal constriction . The two widely study use non selective COX inhibitor indomethacin ibuprofen . The future pharmacological treatment PDA could use nitric oxide inhibitor prostaglandin receptor antagonist . Ibuprofen effective choice treatment PDA preterm infant demonstrate previous several studies.Since meta-analysis claim need study ibuprofen prophylaxis treat PDA low birth weight infant aim evaluate effect ibuprofen prophylaxis extremely low birth weight infant . One marker emerge diagnosis hs-PDA brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) . Natriuretic peptide hormone , produce either atrium ( atrial natriuretic peptide-ANP ) ventricle ( BNP ) response myocardial stress , secondary dilatation , hypertrophy increase wall tension.One aim study investigate effect oral prophylactic ibuprofen administration BNP level renal function .</detailed_description>
