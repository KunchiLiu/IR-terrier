	<criteria>All inclusion criterion answer 'yes ' patient participate clinical trial . Is patient cancer patient breakthrough Pain ( BTP ) ? Has patient receive either oral opioids transdermal fentanyl treatment background pain ( BGP ) within last month prior screen visit ? Is current dose prescribed opioids ( BGP ) equivalent 601000 mg oral morphine/day ? Has patient 's BGP last 7 day prior screen visit generally stable , average control mild level ( define ≤ 4 11point Numerical Rating Scale [ NRS ] ) ? Does patient ( time screen visit ) experience his/her current BTP episode severe pain intensity , he/she general need additional analgesia ( i.e . top background opioid treatment ) ? Has patient average last 7 day prior screen visit least three BTP episode per week , four BTP episode per day ? Is patient able use intranasal drug ? Is life expectancy patient least 3 month date screen visit ? 1 . Has patient illicit substance abuse within last year prior screen ? 2 . Does patient severe hepatic impairment ? define alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) level &gt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 3 .
