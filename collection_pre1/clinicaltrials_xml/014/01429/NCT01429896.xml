	<brief_summary>Food allergy common problem , affect 5-8 % population . Peanut allergy cause reduce quality life due perceive high risk severe reaction . Patients rely accurate label loose pre-packed food , often ambiguous unhelpful . There common conception label 'over-cautious ' . Peanut-allergic consumer face increasingly restrict food choice comply advice due , part , proliferation advisory label 'may contain peanut ' . This contribute reduces quality life affect individual . For industry provide accurate helpful labeling , certain characteristic food-allergic population need define . Firstly , minimum 'eliciting dose ' population estimate study large group peanut allergic patient challenge peanut ingestion increase amount . From , elicit dose provokes reaction 10 % food-allergic population estimate six 14mg peanut protein . Translation population elicit dos ( ED ) acceptable level allergen contamination population require consideration 'safety factor'- account individual variability dose threshold severity . Data suggest variability depend part extrinsic factor ( exercise sleep restriction ) . Each factor may different effect scale direction . The investigator propose cross-over trial 85 peanut-allergic adult undergo baseline peanut challenge follow repeat challenge extrinsic factor apply , random order ( repeat baseline , +exercise +sleep restriction ) . These data define ED UK population safety factor derive shift threshold , inform industry protect allergic population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>N=100 subject undergo baseline challenge peanut without exacerbate extrinsic factor . These initial baseline challenge perform asthma well control ( validate normal spirometry value ) , subject rest evidence viral illness ( clinical history examination ) . A two-day double blind placebo control peanut challenge ( DBPCPC ) perform . Subjects receive either placebo dose active dos one two day . Each day consist eight dos separate 20 minute interval ( 3microg 1g ) . The active dos hide carrier assess blind efficacy . Subjective objective dose threshold severity score challenge outcome record . Subjects receive detailed write verbal advice avoid peanut next challenge . All subject ask carry oral antihistamine injectable adrenaline . All participant clinical reaction initial baseline DBPCFC randomize one 6 balance cross intervention sequence Latin square design . Each group rotate three challenge different order : control ( extrinsic factor ) , exercise sleep restriction . 1 . Control challenge Subjects must accidental reaction peanut previous three month . This challenge perform asthma well control ( validated spirometry normal value ) , subject rest ( sleep diary precede week examine ) viral illness ( clinical history examination ) . A peanut challenge perform ( identically initial baseline DBPCFC ) . Dose threshold severity score challenge outcome record . 2 . Exercise challenge Subjects undergo repeat challenge peanut exercise extrinsic factor , minimum three month previous challenge . Subjects must accidental reaction peanut previous three month . This challenge perform asthma well control ( validated spirometry normal value individual clinical history ) , subject rest , viral illness . The challenge double blind placebo control . The challenge take place two occasion , one day four dos contain placebo , second four dos active ( peanut ) . The subject undergo identical exercise protocol day . On day challenge begin 15 minute exercise use standardise protocol . Following first challenge dose give . This follow 20 minute rest ( observation ) exercise period follow ingestion second dose . The active dos beâ€¦ 1 . 1/100th threshold identify initial baseline challenge 2 . 1/10th threshold identify initial baseline challenge 3 . The threshold dose identify control challenge 4 . One dose increment high dose identify control challenge . Subjective objective dose threshold severity score challenge outcome record . If reaction dose active day active arm repeat separate day , start low available challenge dose ( 3 microgram ) . Dose increment least 1/100th threshold identify control challenge follow . 3 . Sleep restriction Participants undergo repeat double blind placebo control challenge peanut include sleep restriction extrinsic factor , minimum three month last challenge . Subjects must accidental reaction peanut previous three month . This challenge perform asthma well control ( validated spirometry normal value ) , viral illness ( clinical history examination ) . Subjects admit research ward even prior challenge . Overnight , sleep restrict 3 hour ( 2300-0200 ) . Subjects undergo peanut challenge , use dose range interval initial baseline challenge . Subjective objective dose threshold severity score challenge outcome record central online data store . The challenge take place two occasion , one day dose contain placebo , second dos active ( peanut ) . The subject undergo identical sleep restriction protocol day .</detailed_description>
