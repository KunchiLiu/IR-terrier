	<brief_title>Augmenting Language Therapy Aphasia : Levodopa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death common cause disability United States . According American Stroke Association , prevalence stroke U.S. approximately 4.8 million approximately 700,000 additional stroke occur annually . Approximately 150,000 250,000 stroke survivor become severely permanently disabled year . A common neurological deficit among stroke survivor , thus substantial contributor post-stroke disability , aphasia . The loss , difficulty language extremely debilitate enormous social economic impact quality life . Presently , treatment available person aphasia speech-language rehabilitation . With rehabilitation , however , many patient achieve less satisfactory improvement speech-language function , thus leave significant disability . To enhance motor language recovery patient neurological impairment , interest use novel biological therapy , include pharmacological agent , recently emerge . There preliminary evidence increase level dopamine , combination language treatment , may improve deficit aphasia follow stroke . Most study investigate adjunctive effect dopamine agonist bromocriptine , mixed result . However , new evidence suggest levodopa , precursor dopamine , may effective promote language learning . This study propose evaluate effectiveness levodopa study subject Broca 's aphasia stroke , deliver concurrent speech-language rehabilitation . The language change subject receive speech language therapy combine levodopa compare subject receive speech-language rehabilitation placebo ( i.e . pill contain study drug , levodopa ) . The two study group compare determine degree improvement language performance occur degree maintain time . The protocol double-blind : neither subject researcher know whether subject take levodopa placebo study 's conclusion .</detailed_description>
