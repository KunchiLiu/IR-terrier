	<brief_summary>Acute asthma common cause pediatric hospitalization . While investigator know repeat inhalation ß2 agonist ipratropium early oral steroid substantially reduce hospitalization , many child resistant standard initial therapy . About third child remain moderate severe distress standard therapy admit hospital comprise 84 % pediatric acute asthma hospitalization . Finding safe , non-invasive , effective strategy treat child resistant standard therapy would substantially decrease hospitalization result considerable health care saving reduction psycho-social burden disease . While study magnesium sulfate ( Mg ) give intravenously ( IV ) suggest agent reduce hospitalization adult child resistant standard initial therapy Nebulization alternate route administer Mg . This route advantage non-invasive likely much safe due low systemic delivery . Direct delivery via nebulization allow high Mg concentration target site , low airway , small total drug dose . The investigator propose conduct properly design study clarify role nebulized Mg .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan follow specific aim : 1 . Primary Objective : To examine child acute asthma remain moderate severe respiratory distress despite maximized initial bronchodilator steroid therapy reduction hospitalization rate ED receive nebulized Mg salbutamol versus receive salbutamol . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize child Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure ( PRAM ) ≥ 5 point optimized initial inhale bronchodilator oral steroid therapy give nebulized Mg addition nebulized salbutamol significantly low hospitalization rate within 24 hour start study compare give salbutamol . 2 . To compare difference change validate Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure ( PRAM ) , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation blood pressure randomization baseline 240 minute two group 3 . To determine significant association difference primary outcome group patient 's age , gender , baseline PRAM score , personal history atopy `` viral-induced wheeze '' phenotype . Hypothesis ( e ) Tested In randomized , double-blind seven-centre trial , investigator hypothesize child acute asthma Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure ( PRAM ) ≥ 5 point optimized initial inhale bronchodilator oral steroid therapy give nebulized Mg addition nebulized salbutamol least 10 % low hospitalization rate within 24 hour start study compare give salbutamol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 217 year age 2 . Diagnosis asthma/reactive airways/viral wheeze , define diagnosis make physician least one prior acute episode wheeze cough dyspnea treat inhaled ß2 agonists oral corticosteroid . Our study population exclude bronchiolitis firsttime wheeze ( potential alternate diagnosis ) . 3 . Persistent moderate severe airway obstruction 3 dos salbutamol ipratropium , define PRAM 5 high . A PRAM score 5 follow initial therapy indicate child least moderate disease severity high likelihood hospitalized.This group child include 84 % pediatric asthma hospitalization ; therefore , find effective therapy population great potential significantly reduce hospitalization . ( Appendix B ) . 1 . No previous history wheeze bronchodilator therapy . Some child present wheeze first time diagnosis would expect respond Mg. 2 . Patients already receive IV Mg therapy index visit . 3 . Critically ill child require immediate intubation . These child need immediate ICU management hospitalization . 4 . Children opinion treat physician require chest radiograph due atypical clinical presentation find radiologistconfirmed pneumonia . These rare patient may hospitalize primarily treatment infection may respond magnesium . 5 . Known coexistent renal , chronic pulmonary , neurologic , cardiac systemic disease . These condition may influence response Mg hospitalization . 6 . Known hypersensitivity Mg sulfate . 7 . Patients previously enrol study . 8 . Insufficient command English French language . 9 . Lack home cellular telephone . 10 . Known allergy/sensitivity latex .</criteria>
