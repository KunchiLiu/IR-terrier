A substudy focus broad range nursing care HIV-treatment , examine content care deliver support physical , mental , sexual social well-being ; whether delivery AIMS intervention affect quality care domains adherence ; whether content care various domain link patient well-being satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AIMS Study : Improving HIV Treatment Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>**MAIN STUDY** BACKGROUND : Adherence HIV-medication important predictor treatment success , yet 25-40 % patient always take medication prescribe . A nurse-delivered counseling intervention ( AIMS : Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy ) optimize patient adherence show promising result pilot study randomize controlled trial among Caucasian , treatment-experienced patient . AIMS patient-centered counseling intervention support self-regulation medication intake , use feedback report electronically monitor adherence . AIMS evaluate positively patient nurse , develop implement usual patient care minimal time monetary investment . OBJECTIVE : To examine cost-effectiveness AIMS intervention compare `` care-as-usual '' Dutch HIV-clinics among representative sample patient ( ethnicity , start already treatment ) . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS : The study conduct seven HIV-clinics Netherlands select 230 patient ( detail regard sample size calculation : see ) eligible intervention base follow criterion : 1- All treatment experience patient start combination AntiRetroviral Therapy ( cART ) ≥1996 , &gt; 9 month treatment , continue treatment , least one detectable viral load ( blip include ) last 3 year ( count start 9 month cART ) . 2- All treatment-naïve patient initiate treatment . After initial inclusion , treatment experience patient suboptimal adherence measure 2-month electronic monitoring baseline period eligible randomization intervention control group . Treatment-initiating patient randomize directly consent . DESIGN : A prospective multicenter trial randomization patient within nurse . Eligible treatment experience patient suboptimal adherence 2 month baseline adherence monitoring randomize receive either usual care plus AIMS-intervention , care usual . Next , randomized experience patient visit clinic every 4-5 month , minimum 3 visit least 15-month period ( include baseline period total 17 study month ) . Treatment-naïve patient randomize directly consent . As part AIMS-intervention , intervention participant encourage start 2-week readiness trajectory initiate cART . After initiate cART , control intervention participant return visit 2-4 week , 3-4 month , 6-7 month , 9-10 month , 12-15 month . PRIMARY MEASURES : Viral load , health care usage , quality life , adherence data obtain . MEMS-data collect among half control group ( randomly assign MEMS y/n ) . OUTCOMES : 1- Primary cost-effectiveness outcome : ) cost per point increase proportion patient undetectable viral load , b ) cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year ( QALY ) gain . Secondary : Costs per one point increase adherence measure MEMS-caps . 2- Primary effectiveness outcome : The number detectable viral load study month 6-7 , 10-11 , 14-15 experienced patient , month 6-7 , 9-10 , 12-15 patient start treatment . Secondary : Adherence accord MEMS-caps . **PROJECT OBJECTIVES SUB STUDY** BACKGROUND : HIV-nurses ' task go beyond discuss support adherence , include promote patient ' sexual , mental , physical social well-being . Hence , important establish whether deliver AIMS-intervention impact quality/scope usual clinic care important domain . In addition , measure content usual care trial provide opportunity explore whether related patient ' well-being ( sexual , mental , physical , social ) satisfaction care . OBJECTIVES : 1- To monitor content usual care different HIV-nursing domain examine whether usual care content predict patient ' well-being satisfaction HIV-care follow-up . 2- Explore whether deliver AIMS-intervention ( dis ) advantageous effect content impact usual care domains adherence ( sexual , mental , physical , social ) . PARTICIPANTS : HIV-nurses patient study clinic . DESIGN AND MEASURES : HIV-nurses ' usual care regard adherence , well mental , sexual , social physical health assess questionnaire randomization end study . In addition , HIV-nurses complete brief online checklist study visit indicate main topic discuss meeting . At randomization study , patient complete brief questionnaire mental , social , physical sexual health , satisfaction care domains . PRIMARY OUTCOMES : 1- The relation content care patient satisfaction well-being . 2- Potential effect AIMS content care patient well-being treatment satisfaction . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION : During initial grant application , sample size compute base assumption non-adherent , treatment experienced patient would approach . However , follow input participate clinic , final inclusion exclusion criterion formulate explain . An updated sample size computation do inclusion initiate , submit ( date : 27th February , 2013 ) accept ( date : 15th April , 2013 ) funder ( ZonMw , Netherlands Organisation Health Research Development ) use actual trial data order enhance accuracy estimate ( expect treatment effect computation , estimate adjust match new criterion available data ) . Initial sample size calculation : The sample size primary outcome measure compute basis dichotomous dependent variable ( detectable versus undetectable viral load ) , The data plan analyzed use multi-level model ( patient nest within nurse ) would account differential intervention effect nurse . A total sample 432 patient ( 18 nurse ) require detect significant intervention effect post-intervention alpha = .05 ( two-sided ) 80 % power , base follow assumption : depend nurse , ( ) 60 % 80 % patient undetectable viral load usual care ( i.e . ≥ 6 month start cART ) , ( b ) increase intervention condition compare control condition 5 20 percentage point , ( c ) nurse recruits average 25 patient trial . ( ) We expect maximum dropout 20 % . We therefore intend include 450 patient . Updated sample size calculation : The updated sample size computation follow : A sample 230 patient ( 22 nurse ) require obtain 80 % power detect significant intervention effect viral load least one three time point ( treatment-experienced patient : T1 , T2 , T3 ; treatment-initiating patient : T3 , T4 , T5 ) alpha=.05 ( two-sided ) use Bonferroni correction . Viral load baseline use covariate . A multilevel model use random intercept random treatment effect nurse level . The sample size calculation base follow assumption : depend nurse , ( ) 60 % 80 % treatment-initiating patient undetectable viral load usual care ( i.e . ≥ 6 month start ART ) , ( b ) 15 % 20 % treatment experienced-patients treatment-initiating patient detectable viral load baseline , ( c ) increase intervention condition compare control condition 5 20 percentage point , ( ) nurse recruit average 11 patient trial , ( e ) expect maximum dropout 10 % .</detailed_description>
