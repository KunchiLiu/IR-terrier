	<detailed_description>100 suitable patient lung cancer shall take study period 2 year . As per exist treatment protocol department , patient suitable shall undergo routine Pulmonary function test ( PFT ) . Subsequently , record breath hold shall do follow time 1 . At time simulation 2 . At time first fraction radiotherapy 3 . At mid radiotherapy 4 . At radiotherapy conclusion After record ) , patient shall ask perform deep breathing exercises/spirometer ball exercise see effect train breath hold time . Respiratory train All patient shall send respiratory train physiotherapy department . Patients shall counsel respiratory training trained staff vernacular . Whenever possible , patient shall provide one `` Spiroball '' device teach use device . In addition/alternatively patient taught breath exercise . Patients provide spiroball shall instruct use spiroball prescribe technique . The following visit schedule shall observe 1. st visit Within one day date simulation 2. nd visit Date Radiotherapy start Subsequently 2 visit per week radiotherapy course shall conduct ( Tuesdays , Thursdays ) During visit , respiratory train shall reinforce objective record spirometer ball ( whenever use ) shall record . ( Inspiratory volume ) The breathing exercise shall continue radiotherapy . At time , record shall make breath hold time . In general start record nasal clip shall place patient shall ask close mouth voluntarily . The closure mouth shall do nasal clip placement stopwatch record shall start . The end time shall moment patient open mouth start breathe . A one minute pause shall keep separate recording . 1 . Deep inspiratory breath hold ( DIBH ) : A clip shall place nose . The patient shall ask take deep breath mouth hold breath . 2 . Deep expiratory breath hold ( DEBH ) : A clip shall place nose . The patient shall ask exhale maximally mouth hold breath . 3 . Normal mid ventilation breath hold ( NVBH ) : A clip shall place nose . The patient shall ask hold breath middle normal respiration . Beam on/off time As mention , patient shall treat per exist departmental protocol . However , plan component study , patient plan per routine protocol , breath hold data phase shall use calculate number time radiation beam would need patient treat breath hold timing .</detailed_description>
