	<detailed_description>Tobacco smoke leading cause preventable death . Considerable public health effort ongoing Canada-wide reduce prevalence smoke general population . From 1985 2005 , smoke rate among adult reduce 35 % 19 % . However , since time , steady rate decline plateaued around 18-19 % . What else do continue significantly reduce number smoker population level ? One option translate intervention demonstrate clinical efficacy population level initiative . Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) considerable research base demonstrate efficacy . Public health initiative underway distribute NRT widely mass distribution effort . For example , 58,000 NRT treatment distribute province Ontario alone , province Canada consider adopt mass distribution procedure . However , one important question remain unanswered - smoking cessation program involve mass distribution free NRT work ? Preliminary evidence consist before-after smoking status data participant mass NRT campaign yield promising result . However , data use make causal statement impact NRT distribution . To answer question , randomize control trial require . A single blind , panel survey design random assignment experimental control condition use study . A two-stage recruitment process employ , context general population survey two follow-up ( 8 week 6 month ) . Random digit dial Canadian home telephone number identify household adult smoker willing take part smoke study involve three interview , saliva collection 3-HC/cotinine ratio measurement baseline saliva cotinine verification 8-week 6-month follow-up . As part baseline survey , eligible subject identify second recruitment - randomization smoker experimental control condition receive versus receive nicotine patch . Eligibility determine series question regard hypothetical interest nicotine patch quit smoking ( include willingness nicotine patch send home ) contraindication use NRT . A randomized half eligible subject assign experimental condition ask permission nicotine patch send home . Subjects followed-up 8 week 6 month . Subjects control condition offer nicotine patch . Interviewers blind subject ' condition use computer assist telephone interviewing ( CATI ) technology first part 8-week 6-month follow-ups identical experimental control condition , know intervention condition subject belongs question specific use NRT ask near end survey ( i.e. , primary outcome measure assess ) . The primary hypothesis subject receive nicotine patch baseline display significantly high quit rate ( assessed 30 day point prevalence abstinence tobacco ) 6-month follow-up compare subject receive nicotine patch baseline .</detailed_description>
