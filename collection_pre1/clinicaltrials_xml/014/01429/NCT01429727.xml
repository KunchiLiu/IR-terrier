	<brief_title>The `` Virtual '' Multicenter Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection ( SCAD ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection ( SCAD ) relatively rare poorly understood condition report affect woman men . The coronary artery consist three layer , dissection occur two layer separate , enable blood flow space layer . As blood accumulates , cause obstruction normal blood flow within heart , lead chest pain , heart attack even sudden death . The medical community much learn treatment prevention potentially fatal cardiovascular event . Mayo Clinic conduct two new study SCAD . This study consist build database/registry patient SCAD ( whether patient Mayo Clinic ) identify pattern SCAD incidence , cause association could guide future research . With participant consent , Mayo Clinic staff request copy original coronary angiogram SCAD diagnose confirm diagnosis determine eligibility . If eligible , study coordinator contact participant provide information study request sign informed consent document .</detailed_description>
