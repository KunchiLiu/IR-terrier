Similar sickle cell patient chronic cancer patient , patient methadone usually require significantly high dos opioids control pain .

Use MAO inhibitor past 30 day : MAO inhibitor report intensify effect least one opioid drug cause anxiety , confusion significant respiratory depression coma . 9 . C02 measurement great 46 : In accordance similar study ( 0412360 ) , three subset patient CO2 measure use handheld capnometer prior enrollment study . If CO2 measurement great 46 , patient exclude study . The 3 subset follow : All patient history COPD All patient report history asthma together great 20 packyear smoke history All patient report less 20 packyear smoke history asthma exacerbation</criteria>
