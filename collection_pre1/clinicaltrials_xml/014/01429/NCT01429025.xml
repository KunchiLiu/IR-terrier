	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , also work different way kill cancer cell stop dividing . Lenalidomide may stop growth non-Hodgkin lymphoma block blood flow cancer . Giving lenalidomide together rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose give lenalidomide together rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride treat patient refractory relapse indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab , Bendamustine Hydrochloride , Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot/feasibility study bendamustine , rituximab , lenalidomide combination goal assess maximum tolerate dose , safety feasibility combination . Patients receive rituximab IV 5-8 hour day 1 , bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30-60 minute day 1-2 , lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Ancillary treatment available per protocol ( eg , supportive care rituximab infusion ) . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish maximum-tolerated dose lenalidomide combination bendamustine rituximab chemotherapy Secondary - To evaluate toxicity profile lenalidomide combination bendamustine rituximab chemotherapy - To assess progression-free survival - To assess overall complete response rate lenalidomide combination bendamustine rituximab patient relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically treatment correlative study . Tumor tissue sample may also collected.Patients follow 5 year post-registration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year 2 . Histologically confirm relapse ( recurrent previous therapy ( y ) ) refractory ( response previous therapy ( y ) ) , CD20 + indolent/lowgrade Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) express CD20 antigen . Criteria diagnosis find reference J Clin Oncol 17 ( 4 ) : 124453 , 1999 . The biopsy confirm relapse 12 week prior registration long intervening therapy . If patient active treatment within last 12 week , tumor biopsy must repeat study enrollment evaluate transformation . Small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) exclude chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) ( patient peripheral blood lymphocyte count &gt; 5,000 ) Follicular lymphoma , grade 1 , 2 ( grade 3 exclude ) Extranodal marginal zone Bcell lymphoma mucosaassociated lymphatic tissue ( MALT ) type Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma include Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia 3 . Measurable disease ( least 1 lesion ≥ 1.5 cm diameter ) detect compute tomography ( CT ) CT image positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT . Patients Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia require measurable disease CT PET/CT monoclonal protein detectable serum protein electrophoresis and/or IgM level least 2 time upper limit normal 4 . ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 , 1 2 5 . Required laboratory value obtain ≤ 21 day prior registration : ANC ≥ 1,500/mL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR , total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN , direct bilirubin must normal SGOT ( AST ) ≤ 5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min CockcroftGault formula outline protocol 6 . All study participant must register mandatory RevAssist® program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist® . The Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods provide protocol information . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) define per protocol must : 1 .

Must agree ongoing pregnancy test throughout duration study 28 day last dose lenalidomide . Men must agree abstinence use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . 7 . Willing provide inform write consent . 8 . Willing return enrol institution followup . 9 . If currently anticoagulation medication , willing able take lowdose aspirin ( 81 mg ) daily . NOTE : The dose aspirin minimum 81 mg high patient agent reason . If aspirin contraindicate , patient may consider study consultation study chair regard alternative include possible use warfarin low molecular weight heparin . Patients unable take prophylaxis eligible . 10 . Life expectancy ≥6 month 11 . Ability swallow oral medication 1 .

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection Symptomatic congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 6 . Receiving agent would consider treatment lymphoma . Note : Prior use rituximab allow . 7 . Another active malignancy require concomitant active therapy radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy . Exceptions follow : Localized nonmelanotic skin cancer Cancers inactive treat hormonal therapy Any cancer judgment investigator interfere study treatment plan response assessment require concomitant anticancer therapy duration study Contact study chair regard question related eligibility patient concomitant active malignancy 8 .
