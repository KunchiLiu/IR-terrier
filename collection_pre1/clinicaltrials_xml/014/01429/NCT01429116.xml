	<brief_title>Tasimelteon Treatment Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Disorder ( N24HSWD ) Blind Individuals With Light Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder ( N24HSWD ) occur individual unable synchronize endogenous circadian pacemaker 24-hour light-dark cycle , time circadian rhythm instead reflect intrinsic period endogenous circadian pacemaker . As result , circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move gradually later later day circadian period &gt; 24 hour earlier earlier &lt; 24 hour . These individual able sleep well night sleep-wake propensity rhythm approximately align 24-hour light-dark social cycle . However , short time , endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm 24-hour light-dark cycle move synchrony , may difficulty fall asleep well night . In addition problem sleep desired time , subject experience daytime sleepiness daytime nap . As time progress , endogenous circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move away 24-hour light-dark cycle gradually , individual unable sleep night result experience extreme sleepiness daytime hour frequent naps long duration . Eventually , sleep-wake time move back alignment social time sleep individual sleep well night decrease daytime napping . The alignment endogenous circadian rhythm 24-hour day temporary continually drift later later day . The study comprise one 24-month treatment phase , subject enrol trial already diagnose N24HSWD . Frequency study visit depend subject 's prior length exposure tasimelteon ; accordingly , subject assign one two group upon enrollment study . The short-term exposure group consist subject possible screen expose tasimelteon le 6 month . The long-term exposure group consist subject 6 month exposure tasimelteon . After completion 24-month treatment phase , subject option enroll optional open-label extension sub-study additional 52 week . Frequency visit identical regardless previous exposure ( short term/long term ) .</detailed_description>

The sleep disruption lead excessive sleepiness insomnia , . The sleep disturbance cause clinically significant distress impairment social , occupational , important area function . Specifically : A pattern sleepwake cycle synchronize 24hour environment , consistent daily drift ( usually later later time ) sleep onset wake time . 3 .
