	<brief_summary>The study single-blind randomize control trial conduct February August 2009 two township ( Yangbajing Gongtang ) Dangxiong County , area 4300 meter altitude Tibet . A brief baseline survey assessment eligibility perform randomization . A total 282 resident know hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg ) recruit randomly assign intervention control stratification gender baseline blood pressure . The intervention group receive 6-month 's supply salt substitute ( 68 % sodium chloride , 22 % potassium chloride 10 % magnesium sulfate heptahydrate ) control group 6-month 's supply regular salt ( 100 % sodium chloride ) . After 3-month 's intervention , one blood pressure 140 mmHg / 90 mmHg give low-dose diuretic anti-hypertensive therapy . The study hypothesis salt-substitute greatly reduce blood pressure treat patient compare control . Blood pressure level measure baseline follow trained observer use automated sphygmomanometer brief survey level compliance , amount salt consume , reason non-compliance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension one important risk factor induce cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Reducing blood pressure level population control incidence cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease effectively , also reduce mortality . Anti-hypertension drug therapy proven effective method reduce blood pressure . Dietary sodium restriction potassium supplementation core dietary approach stop hypertension . Tibet locate Tibetan Plateau average altitude 4000 meter sea level . Tibetan diet rich meat poor vegetable fruit . Salt intake quite high due habitual drinking salty butter tea . Former national survey show high prevalence hypertension Tibet . The investigator conduct randomize control intervention study test whether investigator offer cost effective way lower blood pressure control hypertension sample subject Yangbajing Gongtang Dangxiong County , Lhasa , Tibet . A randomize control trial conduct Yangbajing Township Gongtang Village Dangxiong county , Tibet . A total 282 hypertensive patient choose study subject . The regular salt salt substitution randomly allocate two group . The whole intervention last 6 month , Phase 1 three month follow Phase 2 another three month . For Phase 1 , study subject allocate regular salt salt substitute randomization . For Phase 2 , study subject continue intervention regular salt salt substitute one blood pressure 140mmHg/90 mmHg give low-dose diuretic anti-hypertensive therapy . During whole intervention period , study subject inform kind salt take . Blood pressure major outcome would measure baseline , 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
