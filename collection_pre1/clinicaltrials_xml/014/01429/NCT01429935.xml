	<brief_summary>Ginger contain constituent pharmacological property similar novel class dual-acting NSAIDs . Compounds class inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism via cyclooxygenase ( COX ) lipooxygenase ( LOX ) pathways . These compound notably few side effect conventional NSAIDs investigate novel class anti-inflammatory compound . Although ginger potentially strong anti-inflammatory component , efficacy acute inflammation assess . The common postoperative sequela surgical removal impact teeth pain , trismus swelling , related local inflammatory reaction , cyclooxygenase prostaglandin play crucial role . NSAIDs ( e.g . Ibuprofen ) effective management postoperative dental pain , likely blockage prostaglandin synthesis commonly use . The efficacy Ibuprofen treatment postoperative dental pain evaluate several clinical trial . However , NSAIDs contraindicate patient gastrointestinal ulcer , bleed disorder , renal dysfunction . Therefore , need effective , oral analgesic favorable safety profile .

	<detailed_description>Ginger , rhizome Zingiber officinale , long history medicinal use . In traditional Chinese Indian medicine , ginger use treat wide range ailment include stomachache , diarrhea , nausea , asthma , respiratory disorder , toothache , gingivitis , arthritis . Subsequent study reveal ginger contains constituent pharmacological property similar novel class dual-acting NSAIDs . Compounds class inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism via cyclooxygenase ( COX ) lipooxygenase ( LOX ) pathways . These compound notably few side effect conventional NSAIDs investigate novel class anti-inflammatory compound . Different animal study reveal oral dried ginger ginger extract reduce inflammation paw joint swell induced different chemical agent , lung inflammation induce lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) arthritis induce collagen . Several clinical study support value ginger treatment osteoarthritis . In addition alleviate pain , ginger extract report decrease joint swell . In trial report ginger relieve pain swell vary degree patient osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis well muscular pain without cause adverse effect period range 3 month 2.5 year . In one recent trial ginger test primary dysmenorrhea comparison Ibuprofen mefenamic acid significant difference find three study group relief , stability , aggravation symptom . The common postoperative sequela surgical removal impact teeth pain , trismus swelling , related local inflammatory reaction , cyclooxygenase prostaglandin play crucial role . NSAIDs ( e.g . Ibuprofen ) effective management postoperative dental pain , likely blockage prostaglandin synthesis commonly use . The efficacy Ibuprofen treatment postoperative dental pain evaluate several clinical trial . However , NSAIDs contraindicate patient gastrointestinal ulcer , bleed disorder , renal dysfunction . Therefore , need effective , oral analgesic favorable safety profile . The primary aim study investigate ability Ginger powder ( Zintoma , Goldaru , Iran ) reduce postoperative swelling , pain trismus third molar surgery .</detailed_description>
