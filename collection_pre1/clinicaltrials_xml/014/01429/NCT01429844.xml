	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy safety two different immunosuppressive regimen prevention bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) ( chronic lung allograft rejection ) lung transplantation : tacrolimus versus cyclosporine , combination mycophenolate mofetil steroid . The study power detect 15 % reduction BOS tacrolimus treat patient . Study design : open-label , randomize , comparative , multi-center , investigator driven</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tacrolimus Versus Cyclosporine Immunosuppression After Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation become viable treatment option select patient end stage lung disease lead prolonged survival improve quality life . However , despite improvement surgical technique , immunosuppressive therapy long-term care , survival rate report Registry International Society Heart Lung Transplantation ( ISHLT ) ( 79 % 1-year 52 % 5-year ) low report solid organ transplant . The lead cause death long-term follow-up lung transplantation chronic allograft dysfunction due obliterative bronchiolitis ( OB ) manifest physiological correlate bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) . OB think result chronic rejection lead obliteration scar terminal bronchiole cause significant reduction pulmonary function parameter , specifically forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . In absence confounding variable , lung transplant recipient consider suffer BOS grade ≥1 experience sustain ( &gt; 3 week ) ≥ 20 % decline FEV1 baseline average two best FEV1 measurement obtain least 3 week apart . Most immunosuppressive regimen lung transplantation base calcineurin inhibitor . The introduction cyclosporine responsible initial success lung transplantation early 1980s allow use lower dose corticosteroid hence afford superior wound heal . Its chief mechanism action blockade T-lymphocyte activation inhibit interleukin-2 ( IL 2 ) synthesis . Tacrolimus macrolide lactone introduce 1990s widely accept alternative cyclosporine . Mechanisms action toxicity tacrolimus cyclosporine similar , tacrolimus proven least effective cyclosporine solid organ transplantation include lung transplantation . Tacrolimus approximately 50 time potent cyclosporine proven effective rescue agent patient either recurrent refractory acute allograft rejection . Whether denovo tacrolimus use reduce incidence BOS compare cyclosporine lung transplantation remain unclear . To date publish adequately powered randomize control trial lung transplantation compare efficacy safety calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine tacrolimus primary immunosuppression . The investigator therefore conduct randomized , open-label , multi-center , investigator driven trial compare tacrolimus cyclosporine - arm combination mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) prednisolone prevention BOS lung heart-lung transplant recipient . The investigator choose partner calcineurin inhibitor MMF instead azathioprine . MMF ester prodrug mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , potent specific inhibitor de novo purine synthesis block proliferation T B lymphocytes . The potential superiority MMF comparator azathioprine lung transplantation suggest small nonrandomized study . However , large randomize trial renal heart transplantation demonstrate great efficacy MMF prevent acute allograft rejection compare azathioprine . The study protocol accept local hospital research ethic committee . All patient provide write informed consent free withdraw study time point . The trial propose design steer committee consist member study group , The European Australian Investigators Lung Transplantation ( EAILTx ) , represent experienced lung transplant center Australia , Austria , Belgium , Germany , Spain Switzerland . The study take place 14 experienced lung transplantation center 5 European country ( Austria , Belgium , Germany , Spain Switzerland ) Australia ( Appendix ) . Patients screen eligibility prior transplantation . At time transplantation , randomization perform use centralize telephone base computer randomization tool . Patients assign receive tacrolimus , MMF corticosteroid cyclosporine , MMF corticosteroid stratify accord whether cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Stratification perform chronic airway infection , multi-organ involvement variable gastrointestinal absorption pose specific clinical problem individual CF may introduce outcome bias imbalance CF patient group . Patients follow 3 year . Regular visit transplantation schedule 1 2 week , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month thereafter . Data enter electronic case report form ( eCRF ) regularly monitor checked inconsistency independent monitor also responsible query management . After completion follow-up period source data verification perform independent data management specialist visit center check patient record completeness data . The study plan design 1999 , protocol write 2000 , first patient randomize 2001 time registration randomize trial mandatory . Reporting follow Consort statement . From January 2001 June 2003 total 265 patient 14 center 6 country randomize transplanted .</detailed_description>
