ED attend physician 's judgment patient 's pain warrant IV opioids : The factor influence decision use parenteral opioids complex . An approach commonly take address issue patient selection drug trial use specific condition ( e.g. , renal colic ) would generally think appropriately treat opioid analgesic , thereby eliminate individual judgment eligibility study . However order maximize external validity role opioids ED setting , investigator decide enroll patient variety diagnosis , complaint acute pain . Opioids appropriate treatment patient present complaint pain ( e.g. , gastroenteritis , migraine ) .

Use opioids tramadol within past 24 hour : avoid introduce assembly bias related recent opioid use , since may affect baseline level pain need analgesic . 2 . Prior adverse reaction opioids . 3 . Chronic pain syndrome : frequently recurrent daily pain least 3 month result modulation pain perception thought due downregulation pain receptor .

Oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % room air : For study , oxygen saturation must 95 % room air order enrol . 7 . Use MAO inhibitor past 30 day : MAO inhibitor report intensify effect least one opioid drug cause anxiety , confusion significant respiratory depression coma . 8 . C02 measurement great 46 : In accordance standard protocol , three subset patient CO2 measure use handheld capnometer prior enrollment study . If CO2 measurement great 46 patient exclude study . The 3 subset follow : All patient history COPD All patient report history asthma together great 20 packyear smoke history All patient report less 20 packyear smoke history asthma exacerbation</criteria>
