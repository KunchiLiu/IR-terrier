	<brief_summary>The investigator would like propose phase-2 prospective multicenter trial evaluate efficacy rituximab combination current chemotherapy strategy adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) , order prove whether addition rituximab induction , consolidation , post-alloHCT status improve outcome term relapse-free survival ( RFS ) compare prior data historical control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According recent result outcome escalated daunorubicin-based protocol adult ALL perform 'Adult ALL Working Party Korean Society Hematology ' ( data announce 2010 Annual Meeting ASCO , Chicago , IL ) , CR rate 90.6 % satisfactory , 2-year / 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) disappointing ( 43.6 % 39.9 % , respectively ) , mean adequate post-remission therapy control minimal residual disease achievement CR important improve outcome adult ALL . Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AlloHCT ) recommend post-remission therapy patient adult ALL , reduce intensity conditioning try decrease TRM rate . However , many patient receive consolidation chemotherapy rather alloHCT owe absence HLA-matched donor , limitation age , combine comorbidities ( among 190 patient include previously-mentioned study , 52.3 % receive alloHCT ) . Recently , stagnation treatment adult ALL appear reach , maybe due borderline intensification chemotherapeutic dose . Dose-escalation strategy many difficulty adoption treatment adult ALL term increase morbidity mortality , mention efficacy strategy . New , preferably non-chemotherapy approach ( maybe target therapy ) therefore urgently require . For Ph ( + ) ALL , introduction BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor improve treatment outcome tolerable toxicity . Applying similar strategy Ph ( - ) ALL , target leukemia surface antigens monoclonal antibody another promising strategy . CD 20 expression least 20 % know find 22-48 % pre-B ALL , appear associated poor prognosis , although controversy pediatric patient . Based significant improvement outcome B-cell NHL , preliminary data regard use rituximab frontline therapy CD20-positive precursor B-cell ALL suggest use may beneficial . Especially , monoclonal antibody think effective combine chemotherapy treat state minimal residual disease , suggest interest evaluate rituximab combine current chemotherapy adult ALL . Recent data efficacy rituximab-combined chemotherapy show rate CR OS superior modify hyperCVAD rituximab regimen compare standard hyper-CVAD ( 70 % versus 38 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) young ( age &lt; 60 year ) CD20-positive subset , although analysis different patient group treat various regimen5 .</detailed_description>
