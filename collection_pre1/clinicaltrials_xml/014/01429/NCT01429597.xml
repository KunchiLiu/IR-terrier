	<detailed_description>Fabry disease X-linked lysosomal disorder lead excessive deposition neutral glycosphingolipids vascular endothelium several organ body . Progressive endothelial accumulation glycosphingolipids account associated clinical abnormality skin , eye , kidney , heart , brain , peripheral nervous system . Fabry disease manifest predominantly men . Female heterozygotes also present feature Fabry disease . It suggest mean age hemizygotic men onset symptomatic stroke 29 - 34 year . The mean age female heterozygotes onset symptomatic stroke 40 - 43 years.In Europe prevalence Fabry disease seem massively underrepresented ; actual textbook describe 1 per 40.000 . However , recent data ( Lin HY , et al. , 2009 ) demonstrate identification eight different mutation alpha-galactosidase A ( alpha-Gal A ) gene 110 027 newborn screen assay alpha-Gal A activity follow genetic analysis . Hwu co-worker ( 2009 ) show 90,288 male newborn screen Fabry disease 73 male GLA gene mutation . Surprisingly , 86 % c.936+919G &gt; A ( also call IVS4+919G &gt; A ) splice mutation . In contrast , screen 81,689 female detect two heterozygote . Summarizing , newborn screen identify surprisingly high frequency Taiwanese males Fabry disease ( approximately 1 1,250 ) , 86 % IVS4+919G &gt; A mutation previously find later-onset cardiac phenotype patients.The late-onset mutation N215S discuss so-called cardiac variant ( Perry Elliott , 2006 ; Eng et al. , 1993 , Sachdev et al. , 2002 ) . The prevalence mutation low , i.e . Fabry disease spontaneously individually inherit so-called private mutation . However , mutation occur frequent . Besides instance R112H , A143T R227X , also N215S belongs group ( Dobrovolny et al. , ASHG Abstract , 2008 ) . The enzyme activity moderately affect , hemizygous patient display clearly decrease activity leucocytes fibroblast . In 2005 , Young colleague ( Acta Paediatr Suppl . ) conclude Gb3 ideal biomarker use example N215S . All heterozygotes unconspicuous 50 % examined hemizygotes increase level . However , globotraosylceramid ( lyso Gb3 ) seem reveal ( genetically ) find patient pathologically elevate level ( mean 1,17ng/ml ( female ) 2,43ng/ml ( male ) respectively ) . In case study 2004 ( Meehan et al. , American Journal Kidney Diseases ) show hemizygous male 75 year age renal manifestation mild proteinuria mildly decrease renal function due high Gb3 accumulation podocytes , less extent tubular endothelial cell . Furthermore , mild congestive heart failure , reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction , hypercholesterolemia . Thus , obvious Fabry patient N215S mutation disease progression mono- oligosymptomatic , show tendency cardiac renal phenotype rather classical manifestation .</detailed_description>
