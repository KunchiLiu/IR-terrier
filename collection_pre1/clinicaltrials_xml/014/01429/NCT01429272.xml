	<brief_title>Minocycline Aspirin Treatment Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abstract : New medication class need improve treatment effectiveness depress phase bipolar disorder ( BD ) . Extant evidence suggest BD characterize reduce monoaminergic signaling , also neural change dendritic remodeling , demyelination , glial neuronal cell loss ( 73 ) . These change hypothesize result chronic inflammation ( 45 ) , base partly convergent evidence proinflammatory cytokine elevate depressed patient BD ( 34 , 12 ) . The principal aim propose research evaluate antidepressant efficacy bipolar depression minocycline , drug neuroprotective immune-modulating property , aspirin , dos expect selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX-1 ) , within context randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group clinical trial follow 2 x 2 design . Specific Aims Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis augmentative treatment minocycline and/ aspirin improve depression rating great extent placebo . Specific Aim 2 : To investigate relationship response minocycline , aspirin marker inflammation ( serum concentration IL-6 CRP , IL-6 mRNA expression peripheral blood monocyte ( PBM ) . The investigator test hypothesis : ) minocycline treatment reduce inflammation great extent placebo ; b ) minocycline treatment change inflammatory cytokine expression correlate change depression rating ; c ) baseline elevation inflammatory marker predict great antidepressant response minocycline .</detailed_description>
