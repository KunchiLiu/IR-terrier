	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment investigational drug ladostigil delay onset Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) patient Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . MCI recognize precursor AD clinical tool available assess cognitive performance earlier stage . Ladostigil currently investigation treatment AD . In study , investigator examine ladostigil low dose level . At dose level , ladostigil show reduce sign early memory loss animal . Thus , study investigator attempt determine earlier invention lower dose ladostigil significantly reduce initial memory loss delay subsequent progression serious cognitive dysfunction .</brief_summary>
