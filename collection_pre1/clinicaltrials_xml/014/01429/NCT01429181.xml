	<brief_summary>There grow evidence d-isomer methadone effective treat neuropathic pain l-isomer methadone effective isomer methadone treat somatic pain . This study examine combination different amount d- l-isomers methadone specifically tailor chronic peripheral neuropathic pain . Non-racemic mixture methadone isomer test pilot efficacy safety study . This study evaluate effect three dose non-racemic mixture methadone hydrochloride patient chronic peripheral neuropathic pain compare placebo . The study also examine minimally effective maximally tolerate dose non-racemic mixture methadone . Finally , safety tolerability non-racemic methadone therapy evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety Study Nonracemic Methadone Relief Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : - To evaluate effect three dose non-racemic methadone HCl metric pain intensity comparison placebo . - To determine minimally effective maximally tolerate dose non-racemic methadone HCl treatment diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain . - To evaluate safety tolerability non-racemic methadone HCl therapy . Study Design : This pilot efficacy safety study comprise two part . Part I double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study three daily dos ( 15 mg , 30 mg 40 mg ) non-racemic methadone compare placebo . Two low dos ( 15 mg 30 mg ) administer 1 week . The final dose ( 40 mg ) administer 2 week . After receive three consecutive dos assign drug subject switch another regimen . Two 28-day treatment period separate 14-day washout ( drug-free ) interval . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment sequence : Sequence 1 : non-racemic methadone HCl ( Period 1 ) follow Placebo ( Period 2 ) ; Sequence 2 : Placebo ( Period 1 ) follow non-racemic methadone HCl ( Period 2 ) . Subjects complete Part I enrol open-label , single-arm extension . Subjects discontinue study placebo may also eligible enrollment . During 6-week extension phase ( Part II study ) subject treated non-racemic methadone HCl continuous dose titration driven clinical response ( degree pain relief ) report adverse event . The Parts I II separate 14-day washout ( study drug-free ) interval . Number Patients : Up fifty ( 50 ) subject diagnose neuropathic pain associate diabetic peripheral neuropathy enrol study ; approximately 30 subject expect complete Study Part I. Enrollment terminate completion target achieve . Study Duration : The duration Study Part I approximately 12 week , duration Study Part II approximately 6 week . A total study duration ( include screen final evaluation ) expect approximately 20 week .</detailed_description>
