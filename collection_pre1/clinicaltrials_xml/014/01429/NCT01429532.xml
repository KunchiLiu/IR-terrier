	<brief_title>Outcomes 3 Incision-size-dependent Phacoemulsification Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It generally case small corneal cataract surgical incision associate rapid wound healing , stable corneal biomechanical property less surgically induced astigmatism ( SIA ) . With development phacoemulsification foldable intraocular lens ( IOL ) recent decade , size clear corneal incision reduce 3.2-mm ( coaxial small incision ) 1.4-mm ( bimanual micro incision ) . Micro incision cataract surgery ( MICS ) , include bimanual micro coaxial phacoemulsification , attract much interest recently , due safety ease learning . However , superiority coaxial micro incision cataract surgery compare conventional coaxial cataract surgery still certain , micro incision phacoemulsification may result long ultrasound time ( UST ) , use ultrasonic power consequently higher endothelial cell loss ( ECL ) . In previous study OZil Torsional phacoemulsification system ( Infinity , Alcon ) , report safety effectiveness cataract surgery influence many factor , include blade use create incision , phacoemulsification apparatus , IOL mode IOL delivery , together constitute surgical system , whose outcome restrict best performance component . Today , micro coaxial phacoemulsification wide use cataract surgery , low limit incision size understood context various component surgical system . In study , compare safety efficacy three different incision-size-dependent phacoemulsification system , 1.8 , 2.2 3.0 mm , evaluate relationship incision size SIA .</detailed_description>
