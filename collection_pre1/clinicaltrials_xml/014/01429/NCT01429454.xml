The specific aim : ( 1 ) To determine whether rate progression psychosis lower six month treatment Omega-3 Fatty Acids compare six month treatment placebo , ( 2 ) To determine whether Omega-3 Fatty Acids efficacious placebo prodromal symptom , negative symptom , functioning , ( 3 ) To assess safety tolerability Omega-3 Fatty Acids population , ( 4 ) To conduct analysis neuroimaging , neurocognitive , electrophysiological ancillary data explore mechanistic explanation hypothesize benefit Omega-3 Fatty Acids clinical functional outcome ( e.g. , increase white matter integrity process speed ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAPLS Omega-3 Fatty Acid Versus Placebo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment subject clinical assessment test dependent measure consider research purpose . Use make exist data record data obtain protocol use combination data record collect part overall NAPLS study subject already enrol . Individuals protocol recruit UCSD 's parent NAPLS study . Experimental Treatment : This 24-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo , fix dose-controlled study design determine acceptability feasibility Omega-3FA versus placebo prodromal subject assign treatment 1:1 basis . Omega-3FA administer oral capsule give twice daily ( BID ) . Ocean Nutrition Canada prepare identical-looking Omega-3FA placebo capsule . The investigator include 128 prodromal subject 6-month trial . All subject receive monthly clinical assessment . The study design Omega-3FA formulation design compatible another on-going trial conduct investigator Australia Europe ( Neuropro Study sponsor Stanley Foundation ) , would enable data two study combine analysis primary ( conversion ) secondary tertiary ( symptom , function ) endpoint . The propose study potentially development novel treatment approach prodrome psychosis . This research provide empirical data regard low risk , broad spectrum treatment , could important implication public health pre-emptive intervention treatment augmentation potential effect functional outcome . It possible subject treatment group show improvement symptom . Study participant receive extensive clinical evaluation consultation investigator knowledge regard psychosis . The result study increase ability provide alternative treatment potentially few side effect prodrome psychosis . The potential implication primary tertiary prevention psychosis treatment immeasurable . Through development utilization strategy propose research investigator could potentially discover ability delay onset psychosis manage treatment effectively few side effect see traditional antipsychotic medication treatment . The importance public health would tremendous . The use Omega-3FA adolescent young adult prodromal population somewhat novel . Amminger et al 60 utilized sample 13 - 25 year old prodromal subject determine potential benefit EPA DHA . Previous study use Omega-3FA adolescent adult sample psychotic subject produce significant side effect . Some subject report fishy aftertaste mild gastrointestinal difficulty dissipate discontinuation Omega-3FA . Therefore level risk consider minimal . This study offer subject possibility direct benefit participation Omega-3FA placebo treatment . It also possible concurrent use Omega-3FA improve metabolic indices subject . Because Omega-3FA specifically approve FDA use early psychosis , investigator receive certificate Investigational New Drug ( IND ) current Research Plan . The sample 128 prodromal subject recruit 8 site 16 month . UCSD expect recruit 14 prodromal subject . The active treatment phase complete within 6 month , 12- , 18- , 24-month follow-up . Each site obtain institutional review board approval protocol . The UCLA site direct Dr. Cannon UCSD site direct Dr. Cadenhead , coordinate trial , responsibility acquisition Omega-3 placebo pill , group assignment , data analysis . Procedures During week prior randomization begin study capsule , patient undergo eligibility baseline examination . After begin study capsule , patient schedule 6 monthly follow-up visit well 12- , 18- , 24-month follow-up ( Table 1 ) . Omega-3FA Placebo : The Omega-3FA compound manufacture Ocean Nutrition Canada contain 2:1 proportion EPA DHA capsule include 370 mg EPA 200 mg DHA well 2 mg/g Tocopherol . The dose two capsule per day total 740 mg EPA 400 mg DHA . The ratio dose Omega-3FA select base previous data control trial demonstrate efficacy EPA trial schizophrenia patients37 , 38 potential benefit low dose DHA combination EPA per Amminger study60 prodromal patient . The placebo soybean/corn blend . Both Omega-3FA placebo color carob ( shell brown ) flavor natural lemon-lime , mask . Certificates analysis Omega-3FA placebo compound include Appendix . Ongoing test independent laboratory assure level Omega-3FA capsule , stability , absence contaminant , include toxic substance product . Stability toxicology test provide Siliker Canada Co. UCLA receive compound assign cod number packet distribution sit thereby administer double blind design . Antipsychotics : Prodromal subject currently anti-psychotic medication exclude study . It possible prodromal subject develop worsen symptom require treatment course trial , allow . All concomitant treatment record . Antidepressants : Prodromal patient currently anti-depressant medication include study ; randomization Omega-3FA vs. placebo stratify anti-depressant medication status . Background Diet : Baseline diet characterization assess use systematic checklist . The investigator consider use open-ended diary require record food intake , seem unlikely adolescent early psychosis symptom would comply satisfactory degree . The checklist easy complete likely accurate unstructured self-reports . The list include food rich Omega-3FA . It give family first screen visit , collect two consecutive week precede entry treatment phase . Intake categorize low ( 0-1 serving/wk Omega-3FA rich diet ) , intermediate ( 2-3 servings/wk ) , high ( 4 servings/wk ) . In addition fast erythrocyte FA composition assess use another mean control background diet baseline . Laboratory Metabolic Measures : After confirm eligibility study , urine sample take drug screen , serum pregnancy test female . Fasting erythrocyte FA composition quantify baseline , month 3 month 6 use capillary gas chromatography . The ratio Omega-6 3FAs used index pretreatment v posttreatment FA composition objective measure treatment adherence , assess dietary difference subject assure subject placebo take Omega-3FA supplementation outside source . Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances ( TBARS ) use screen monitoring lipid peroxidation treatment trial . In addition , assess metabolic parameter , baseline measure fast glucose lipid , weight , abdominal girth blood pressure obtain repeated end trial . Other Concomitant Medications : Subjects may continue dos antidepressant , mood stabilizer , stimulant medication prescribe independently participation trial . Antipsychotic mediation permit unless subject develop worsen symptom require antipsychotic medication course trial . All concomitant treatment record . Concomitant Psychotherapy : During 6-month active treatment phase , subject receive 6 session supportive case management , need , part evaluation psychological staff . Staff member provide support address young person 's effort cope symptom functional deficit . In addition , subject permit participate outside study supportive psychotherapy , concomitant psychological treatment record . Study Management : Prior study launch , study investigator key personnel participate several conference call provide train study procedure , include recruitment strategy , inclusion exclusion criterion , use rating scale , data management procedure . After study launch , co-PIs UCLA UCSD sit chair conference call every two week attend site PI study coordinator . Reports enrollment data completeness discuss regularly , along issue bring site . Data Management : UCLA provide central data management site propose study , University Calgary site ( Dr. Addington ) responsible overall NAPLS data management . This do centralized Oracle database web base data input facilitate study coordination , data check early identification faulty procedure data error . The database secure , robust easy clinical investigator staff learn use . Security access limit site level range access different level personnel . Data entry high standard data element/field define range , allow value size . Post-treatment Biomarkers Assessment Patients enrol trial participant parent study `` Predictors Mechanisms Conversion Psychosis . '' In context study , participant assess MRI/DTI , electrophysiology ( include PPI ) , neuropsychological test baseline 12- 24-month follow-up . Given participant Omega-3FA study complete active treatment phase 6 month , desirable add additional biomarkers assessment point subject 6-month ( end treatment ) follow-up . Assessments Sources material come primarily participant , form result questionnaire , clinical interview , physical exam , blood draw . All participant undergo series clinical , functional , neurocognitive , neuroimaging electrophysiological assessment , part overall NAPLS study , 6 month Omega-3FA versus placebo . Therefore data collect part parent study assess change may attributable treatment trial . Biological specimen ( blood ) collect baseline , 3 month 6 month Omega-3FA trial help evaluate level Omega-3FA diet metabolic index well ( urine ) evaluate substance use time test . For minor , parent/legal guardian may provide additional information useful clinical historical data . Written oral consent obtain participant , legal guardian minor participant . Assent obtain minor . Only study personnel directly associate research access individually identifiable information .</detailed_description>
