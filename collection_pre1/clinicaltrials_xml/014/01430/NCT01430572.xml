	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Votrient ( pazopanib ) Afinitor ( everolimus ) give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug also study . Pazopanib design block different receptor cancer cell ultimately responsible growth tumor blood vessel . Everolimus design block protein call mTOR inside cancer cell , also involved cancer growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Dose Escalation : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level combination pazopanib everolimus base join study . Up 8 dose level pazopanib everolimus test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose pazopanib everolimus find . Expansion : Once high tolerable dose pazopanib everolimus find , 14 participant may enrol study safety drug dose efficacy drug certain tumor group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . Pazopanib everolimus take mouth empty stomach ( 1 hour meal 2 hour meal ) . On Days 1-5 Cycle 1 , take pazopanib everolimus together . First take pazopanib take everolimus . After first 5 day , take pazopanib everolimus every day separately . Starting Day 6 Cycle 1 , pazopanib take every even day ( 6 , 8 , 10 , ) . Everolimus take every odd day ( 7 , 9 , 11 , ) . Beginning Cycle 2 , take pazopanib every even day ( 2 , 4 , 6 , ) everolimus every odd day ( 3 , 5 , 7 , ) . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug herbal supplement may take side effect . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record 3 day since screening . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test hepatitis screen . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ECG . On Day 15 Cycle 2 : ° Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . Every 8 week : - You CT scan , x-ray , MRI scan , and/or PET scan check status disease . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) may draw tumor marker test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . PK testing : At least 6 participant expansion part study blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . The study staff tell test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - On Day 5 Cycle 1 Days 1 2 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 8 time 10 hour take study drug . - On Day 2 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 1 time PK test 24 hour take everolimus . If could 10 hour draw day , draw day . - On Day 6 Cycle 1 Day 3 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 1 time PK test 24 hour take pazopanib . If could 10 hour draw day , draw day . - Blood drawn 1 time end-of-dosing visit . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , develop new health problem , doctor think longer best interest receive study drug . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . This investigational study . Pazopanib FDA approve commercially available treatment advance renal cancer certain type advance soft tissue sarcoma approve use cancer type . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available prevention kidney transplant rejection , treat advance renal cancer , treat subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associate tuberous sclerosis . The combination pazopanib everolimus treat advanced cancer investigational . Up 62 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
