	<brief_summary>This study Phase 2 , open-label study ass pharmacokinetics ( PK ) safety AA4500 0.58 mg men Peyronie 's disease . Subjects screen study eligibility within 21 day initial injection study drug . Two injection administer 24 hour apart . Subjects admit study unit day first injection AA4500 ( Day -1 ) remain study unit PK sample collect investigator penile plaque model Day 3 . Subjects return study unit Day 4 , Day 8 , Day 29 follow-up pharmacokinetic safety assessments.Pharmacokinetic plasma sample collect predetermine time point ( 15 minute pre-injection ) injection Day 1 Day 2 ( 5,10 , 20 , 30 minute 1,2,3,4,8,12 hour ) , Days 3 , 4 , 8 , 29.Plasma level AUX-I ( clostridial type I collagenase ) AUX-II ( clostridial type II collagenase ) determine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Be male ≥ 18 year age 2 . Be stable relationship female partner/spouse least 3 month screen willing vaginal intercourse partner/spouse 3 . Have symptom ( ) Peyronie 's disease least 12 month first dose study drug evidence stable disease determine investigator 4 . Have penile curvature least 30° dorsal , lateral , dorsal/lateral plane screening . It must possible delineate single plane maximal curvature evaluation study 5 . Be judge good health , base upon result medical history , physical examination , laboratory profile 6 . Voluntarily sign date inform consent agreement approve Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) . The subject must also sign authorization form allow disclosure protect health information ( PHI ) . The PHI authorization form inform consent form may integrate form may separate form depend institution 7 . Be able read , complete understand various rating instrument English A subject exclude study participation : 1 . Has penile curvature le 30° great 90° screen visit 2 . Has follow condition : Chordee presence absence hypospadias ; Thrombosis dorsal penile artery vein ; Infiltration benign malignant mass result penile curvature ; Infiltration infectious agent , lymphogranuloma venereum ; Ventral curvature cause ; Presence active sexually transmitted disease ; Known active hepatitis B C ; Known immune deficiency disease positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 3 . Has previously undergone surgery Peyronie 's disease 4 . Fails erection opinion investigator sufficient accurately measure subject 's penile deformity administration appropriate pharmacological stimulant ( eg , prostaglandin E1 trimix ) 5 . Has calcify plaque evident appropriate radiographic evaluation , penile xray penile ultrasound would prevent proper injection study medication . Noncontiguous stipple calcium acceptable inclusion provide calcium deposit interfere injection AA4500 plaque 6 . Has isolate hourglass deformity penis ( curvature cause plaque noncontiguous hourglass deformity may treat ) 7 . Has plaque cause curvature penis locate proximal base penis , injection local anesthetic would interfere injection AA4500 plaque 8 . Has previously receive alternative medical therapy Peyronie 's disease administer intralesional route ( include , limited , steroid , verapamil , naturally occur low molecular weight protein , interferonα2b ) within 3 month first dose study drug plan use medical therapy time study 9 . Has receive alternative medical therapy Peyronie 's disease administer oral ( include , limited , vitamin E [ &gt; 500 U ] , potassium aminobenzoate [ Potaba ] , tamoxifen , colchicine , pentoxifylline , overthecounter erectile dysfunction medication , steroidal antiinflammatory drug ) topical route ( include , limited , verapamil apply cream ) within 3 month first dose study drug plan use medical therapy time study 10 . Has extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) correction Peyronie 's disease within 6 month period screen plan ESWT time study 11 . Has use mechanical type device correction Peyronie 's disease within 2week period screen plan use device time study 12 . Has use mechanical device induce passive erection within 2week period screen plan use device time study 13 . Has significant erectile dysfunction fail respond oral treatment phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitors 14 . Has penile Duplex Doppler ultrasound evaluation screening show compromise penile hemodynamics opinion investigator clinically significant 15 . Has uncontrolled hypertension , determine investigator 16 . Has know recent history stroke , bleeding , significant medical condition , investigator 's opinion would make subject unsuitable enrollment study 17 .
