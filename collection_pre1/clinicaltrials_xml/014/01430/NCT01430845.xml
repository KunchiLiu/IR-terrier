	<detailed_description>The purpose study find relationship stage quality developmental delay young age , final diagnosis child get year later ( MR , type PDD , CP comorbidity disorder ) . We assume analysis developmental subtests show developmental direction child predict later diagnosis . The developmental test choose purpose BSID comprehensive worldwide developmental test . In addition , want find correlation developmental delay early age intellectual functioning future . We assume analyze subtests developmental test succeed predict expected cognitive level ( IQ ) . Medical file participate child analyze . The file sort GDD diagnosis contain BSID test data select . The performance BSID test current diagnosis child record . A trained researcher process BSID data build database include finding test , current diagnosis child level MR , case child suffers MR ( comorbidly ) . In order test research assumption appropriate statistic test do use statistical program SPSS version 17 . This study important implication . Findings show developmental test effective tool , evaluate general developmental delay , auxiliary tool diagnose predict type disability level retardation . These finding breakthrough diagnostic field . In addition , ability predict type disability level mental retardation developmental test use widely allow early intervention , widely prove , early intervention , good outcome . In addition , vast range people benefit finding . Professionals doctor , psychologist paramedical therapist , government body community resource design build support system service child family . Most importantly , family diagnose child child able prepare new reality design life accordingly .</detailed_description>
