	<brief_summary>The increase use sedentary screen-based activity ( SBAs ) recently blame child adolescent ' lack engagement physical activity ( PA ) . Studies indicate large portion child participate high-levels sedentary SBAs sedentary SBAs appear compete time engage PA . If sedentary behavior substitute PA , help increase PA , strategy need put place help decrease sedentary behavior . One modification sedentary videogames may increase PA child alter sedentary videogames videogames actually provide option engage PA , rather sedentary . These type game n't compete PA , actually source PA . These type videogames call active video game ( AVG ) `` Exer-gaming . '' Previous research demonstrate energy-expenditure ( EE ) AVG play comparable moderate-intensity walking produce great EE sedentary SBAs . However , previous study limit measure EE AVG play walk either treadmill structure set . Studies investigate EE AVG play compare EE free-living outdoor play . Thus , purpose propose study determine whether great EE release AVG play compare free-living , outdoor play child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estimating Energy Expenditure Active Video Gaming Compared Unstructured , Outdoor Play Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen child , age 5- 8- year , attend nearby preschool , normal body mass index ( BMI ) -for-age percentile , &gt; 5th % &lt; 85th % .BMI , participate unstructured , outdoor play one AVGs randomize order . Activity type , duration intensity measure via accelerometery direct observation . The EE calculate Metabolic Equivalent ( MET ) value percent time activity meet MVPA intensity calculate . A MET energy cost activity express kilocalorie expend per kilogram body weight per hour activity ( 7 ) . If EE intensity AVG play similar EE intensity outdoor play , AVG play could great supplement effort aim increase PA child . Specific Aims : 1 . To measure EE acquire 15 minute AVG , adventure game , compare unstructured outdoor play child 5- 8- year age . 2 . To compare percent time activity meet definition MVPA ( MET value &gt; 3 ) child age 5- 8-years age .</detailed_description>
