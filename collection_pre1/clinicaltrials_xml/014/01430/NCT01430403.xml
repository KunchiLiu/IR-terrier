	<detailed_description>While increase prevalence asthma abate , level asthma morbidity mortality remain near record high . An asthma exacerbation major factor contribute morbidity , even mortality patient asthma . Although current approach treatment reduce risk , asthma exacerbation major problem inner-city patient family , prevention event continue significant challenge . In child asthma , predictable seasonal epidemic exacerbation , especially fall season , otherwise know `` September epidemic . ''</detailed_description>
