	<brief_summary>Serotonin recently identify major regulator bone formation . Gut-derived serotonin inhibits bone formation , early animal study show inhibition gut-derived serotonin anabolic effect bone ovariectomised rodent . This pathway potential develop new anabolic treatment osteoporosis human . Carcinoid neuro-endocrine tumour produce high level serotonin , might expect patient carcinoid disease would reduce bone formation , low bone mass fracture . However , apparent clinical practice . There may discrepancy rodent model human disease . This study aim identify whether patient carcinoid disease reduce bone mass , reduce bone formation high fracture rate . The investigator conduct cross-sectional observational case-control study patient carcinoid disease Sheffield neuro-endocrine tumour clinic gender- , age- body mass index ( BMI ) -matched control .</brief_summary>
