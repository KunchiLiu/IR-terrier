	<brief_summary>The investigator aim establish whether complete subacromial decompression repair complete rotator cuff tear clinical significance . Both arthroscopic decompression rotator cuff repair complete surgical date . The investigator null hypothesis contend full-thickness rotator cuff tear repair perform versus subacromial decompression influence patient 's post-operative pain functionality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Patient Function Satisfaction With Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression Before After Repair Complete Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient diagnose full thickness rotator cuff tear symptomatic subacromial decompression consult arthroscopic subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair . The possible risk benefit discuss patient detail operating surgeon . If patient agrees undergo surgical intervention ( i.e . arthroscopic subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair surgical setting ) , approach inform regard involvement study . This single blind study participant know arm randomize . Once consent , subject randomize one two treatment arm . Those Arm A subacromial decompression repair complete rotator cuff Arm B subacromial decompression repair complete rotator cuff . Prior surgical intervention patient complete two separate questionnaire wait room . The result questionnaire later use compare pre-operative post-operative change follow shoulder surgery . On date surgery , operative surgeon ensure full-thickness rotator cuff tear present associate acromial spur . If present , operative surgeon perform surgical intervention previously assign order accord patient 's treatment arm . All acromial spur bur level flush remain non-pathologic acromion . The full-thickness rotator cuff repair utilizing suture suture anchor . The specific pattern repair determine intra-operatively . This standard procedure arthroscopic rotator cuff repair subacromial decompression . There known risk within orthopedic literature perform subacromial decompression versus rotator cuff repair . As , study aim identify significance order surgery exist . Post-operatively patient place within Berg SlingShotÂ® . All patient undergo period immobilization within sling . Patients evaluate 2 week , 6 week , 12 week post-operatively . The shoulder range motion relative strength , compare contralateral limb , assess . They prescribe formal physical therapy outpatient set . At 12 week visit subject complete questionnaire . The score tabulate inserted Excel spreadsheet . The pre-operative post-operative score compare . The change score treatment arm average analyze statistically significant difference . Also , pre- post-operative forward flexion , abduction range motion compare . The external internal rotation strength compare pre- post-operative evaluation .</detailed_description>
