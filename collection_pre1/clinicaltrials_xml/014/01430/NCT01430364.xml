	<brief_title>BIfurcation Optimal Treatment Strategy With LYMus Eluting Dedicated Bifurcation Versus Convention Stent Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The coronary bifurcation lesion pose therapeutic problem high rate periprocedural complication , high rate in-stent restenosis stent thrombosis . These lesion stenting superior comparison balloon angioplasty regard side branch . It demonstrate many time , literature daily practice , angiographically high grade ostial side branch stenosis flow limit cause ischemia , therefore require treatment . From side , data magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) demonstrate occurrence angiographic stenosis 70 % diameter associate periprocedural myonecrosis region side branch . This fact put important question mechanism myonecrosis . If jailed side branch significant flow limit stenosis , degree residual ischemia , period persistence could lead myonecrosis , mean aggressive treatment ostial stenosis need . It interesting strategy treatment important , techniques second stent implantation ( primary purpose limit side branch ( SB ) ischemia ) associate high grade troponin increase . Of course association causality , despite randomize study confirm also . Even introduction drug-eluting stent ( DES ) treatment coronary bifurcation lesion , important basic problem remain . It propose problem related non-dedicated design conventional stent intend treatment straight vessel segment . Thus deformation stent bifurcation implantation depend stent cell shape , size material property ( 11 ) . To resolve problem suggest make dedicated bifurcation stent ( 1 , 2 , 11 ) . However , special `` dedication '' per se define unclear terminology - stent could dedicate patient fit anatomical characteristic particular bifurcation point ( vessel diameter , angulation ) , give well hemodynamic condition ; stent could dedicate operator make procedure quicker safer , eliminate limit SB compromise . Probably best option combination characteristic . The currently available stent market generally target second requirement . Three group stent available moment - proximal main vessel ( MV ) stent ( Axxess , Devax , USA ) , MV stenting across SB different design make possible permanent access SB finally purely SB dedicate stent ( Tryton , Sideguard , Biguard ) . Neither stent match proximal - distal MV size difference take account vessel angulation . The device success rate varies considerably ( 75 % - 100 % ) ; however study 100 % success perform 11 patient . For device success rate around 85 % . The proximal MV stent SB stent require additional stent implantation non-intended vessel . Stents design permanent access SB implant 2 wire , reality make procedure difficult demand rather simplify ( primary intention stent ) . The reason wire crisscross , wire-bias proper orientation device SB ( rotational axial positioning ) . This , along requirement large guide catheter size explains dedicate stent gain popularity interventional cardiology community . The BiOSS Lim stent ( Balton , Warsaw , Poland ) completely different system . The stent design user friendly : track one wire profile quite low ( 1.08mm ) , make possible implant even 5 Fr guide catheter . The stent fit bifurcation anatomy - match proximal - distal diameter main vessel ( MV ) ; permit deformation mid-part adapt exactly main vessel - main branch angle angle , make wide opening SB . If SB must dilate stent recrossing easy , wider proximal narrow distal part give step-down carina tip region , way self direct wire SB . The proximal distal part stent work independently SB could safely dilate without need kiss balloon inflation deformation contralateral wall strut . This simplify shorten procedure . And finally , stent construction prevents carina displacement , basic mechanism side branch compromise . Study aim : compare two intervention strategy bifurcation treatment - provisional T-stenting ( PTS ) drug-eluting stent ( sirolimus eluting ) , kiss balloon inflation end procedure - best treatment strategy moment , stenting bifurcation lesion dedicate bifurcation drug-eluting stent BiOSS Lym .</detailed_description>
