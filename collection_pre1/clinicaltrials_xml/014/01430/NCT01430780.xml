	<brief_summary>Basic study show sustain use nitrate might associate adverse effect vascular function mediate increase nitrate-induced oxidative stress . But remain unclear whether oxidative stress increase endothelial function impairment patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) administration long-term oral nitrate . The investigator evaluate whether administration long-term isosorbide mononitrate ( ISMN ) treatment associate oxidative stress increase endothelial function impairment patient CAD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluate Effect Chronic Nitrate Therapy Vasodilation Function Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Organic nitrate widely prescribe treatment angina pectoris patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . In China , many patient CAD prescribe nitrate long-term treatment . The commonly prescribed nitrate long-time treatment isosorbide mononitrate ( ISMN ) . The reason use majority physician believe chronic therapy organic nitrate associate improvement symptom neutral potentially beneficial effect long-term patient outcome , although assumption remain unproven . Recently , multiple line evidence document sustain use nitrate associate adverse effect vascular function appear mediated increase nitrate-induced oxidative stress . The accumulation oxygen free radical chronic nitrate therapy associate endothelial dysfunction , increase arterial sensitivity vasoconstrictor development abnormality number important enzyme involve regulation vascular homeostasis , include superoxide dismutase , protein kinase C , matrix metalloproteinases , prostaglandin synthase . This may lead development nitrate tolerance , endothelial dysfunction . Furthermore , endothelial dysfunction risk factor bad prognosis patient CAD . Up date , clinical research focus prevent tolerance clinical outcome nitrate therapy involve short follow-up period week . It short ass true clinical impact nitrate-induced endothelial dysfunction , safety long-term nitrate therapy require systematic review . So prospective , randomize study longer treatment period need observe chronic impact nitrate therapy endothelial function . Therefore , investigator prospectively investigate whether long-term ISMN therapy influence endothelial function evaluate brachial artery ultrasound image reactive hyperemia patient catheterization confirm CAD , whether associate increased oxidization inflammation burden .</detailed_description>
