	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease cause progressive damage joint body , affect functional capacity . Effective management patient RA require multidisciplinary approach . Despite various combination , significant population RA patient respond combination show inadequate response methotrexate alone . Hence , need unique combination drug target different pathological process yield best result patient prognosis poor . Combination revamilast first line therapy like methotrexate could provide good treatment option large population RA patient moderate severe disease inadequately control one DMARDs . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . The study include patient active RA receive stable maximum tolerate dose MTX . Patients recruit provide write informed consent . After screen run period ( single blind placebo 4 week ) , patient randomize ( meet randomization criterion ) 1:2:2:2 ratio receive either one three dos ( Low , Medium High ) revamilast placebo along MTX . The primary objective study determine percentage patient achieve ACR20 response 12 week . Secondary objective include determine percentage patient ACR50 ACR70 response , change DAS-28 score , change serum CRP ESR value frequency use rescue medication . During treatment period , 5 study visit week 2 , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 , efficacy , safety tolerability assessment visit week 14 follow visit .</brief_summary>
