	<brief_title>Withdrawal Study Demonstrate Maintenance Effect Treatment Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder ( N24HSWD ) occur individual unable synchronize endogenous circadian pacemaker 24-hour light-dark cycle , time circadian rhythm instead reflect intrinsic period endogenous circadian pacemaker . As result , circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move gradually later later day circadian period &gt; 24 hour earlier earlier &lt; 24 hour . These individual able sleep well night sleep-wake propensity rhythm approximately align 24-hour light-dark social cycle . However , short time , endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm 24-hour light-dark cycle move synchrony , may difficulty fall asleep well night . In addition problem sleep desired time , subject experience daytime sleepiness daytime nap . As time progress , endogenous circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move away 24-hour light-dark cycle gradually , individual unable sleep night result experience extreme sleepiness daytime hour frequent naps long duration . Eventually , sleep-wake time move back alignment social time sleep individual sleep well night decrease daytime napping . The alignment endogenous circadian rhythm 24-hour day temporary continually drift later later day . This multicenter , randomize withdrawal , double-masked , placebo-controlled , parallel study . The study three phase : tasimelteon run-in phase , tau estimation phase , randomize withdrawal phase . Subjects participate study VP-VEC-162-3201 meet entry criterion study eligible run-in phase The run-in phase comprise screen visit subject 's initial eligibility evaluate . Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion screen enter run-in phase dose 20 mg tasimelteon daily 6 week . The tau estimation phase ( 48 hour urine collection sample evaluate response tasimelteon ) follow run-in phase last approximately 6 week long . The randomized withdrawal phase comprise approximately eight week treatment either placebo tasimelteon 20 mg take approximately 1 hour prior target bedtime double-masked fashion .</detailed_description>
