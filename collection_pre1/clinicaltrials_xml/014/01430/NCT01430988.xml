	<brief_title>Observational Study BrainScope® Ahead™ M-100 UK Emergency Department Patients With Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One million patient attend Emergency Departments ( ED ) head injury year United Kingdom ( UK ) Ireland . 150,000 patient need hospital admission one study estimate incidence 45-48 % moderate severe disability survive admission . Although incidence head injury high , incidence death head injury low . Therefore ED 's require see large number patient minor/mild head injury , identify small number go serious complication . The challenge emergency medicine clinician identifying patient head injury important brain injury require attention patient safely send home . The standard determining important brain injury result Computerised Tomography ( CT ) scan head . CT scan nonportable expose individual high radiation level . The study medical device portable , point care , noninvasive non radiation-emitting medical device design assist clinician early identification , stag , optimisation treatment patient head injure .</detailed_description>
