	<brief_summary>The purpose study determination effective vitamin D replacement strategy vitamin D deficiency state currently available preparation Pakistan &amp; determine cost effective monitoring strategy urinary calcium excretion serve surrogate marker achievement vitamin D sufficiency state . The study conduct out-patient Endocrinology Clinics Aga Khan University Hospital , Karachi , Pakistan . All patient see endocrine clinic Vitamin D level le 20 ng exclusion criterion mention eligible recruitment study . The study participant randomly assign 4 group intervention receive intramuscular oral Vitamin D 200,000 600,000 unit per group allocation . Each group comprise 25 participant . Group 1 : Vitamin D3 600,000 unit IM every 2 monthly 2 time level remain &lt; 30 ng/ml . Group 2 : Vitamin D3 600,000 unit orally every 2 monthly 2 time level remain &lt; 30 ng/ml . Group 3 : Vitamin D3 200,000 unit IM initially every 2 monthly 2 month level remain &lt; 30 ng/ml . Group 4 : Vitamin D3 200,000 unit orally initially every 2 monthly 2 time level remain &lt; 30 ng/ml . All patient prescribe elemental Calcium 1 gram /day . Vitamin D level along biochemical parameter random urine calcium &amp; creatinine check 00 , 02 , 04 , 06 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency ( VDD ) resurface significant public health problem recent year . In Pakistan well region , VDD prevalent despite adequate sunshine throughout year . Prevalence VDD 92 % 81 % ambulatory patient report center Karachi Lahore recently . Reports previously also demonstrate VDD various region Pakistan , study conduct tertiary care hospital Karachi find 55 % healthy breast feed infant 45 % nursing mother low level vitamin D. Another study conduct Hazara division find rickets common problem child despite abundant sunlight . There several area controversy great relevance investigator community like level vitamin D consider deficiency , daily requirement vitamin D VDD correct . Generally level 20ng/ml consider deficient level 21 29 ng/ml consider relative insufficiency depict intestinal calcium absorption nadir level parathyroid hormone . Determination daily intake require attain adequate serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration compound wide variability dose-response curve basal 25 ( OH ) D concentration . There universally accept method correct VDD , In US available preparation 50,000 unit ergocalciferol , give weekly three time per week total 300,000 unit . Several strategy recently study , study southern Brazil demonstrate single 300 000 IU oral dose vitamin D3 effective 800 IU per day increase serum 25 ( OH ) D level elderly person , live low-income housing unit . Contrary comparison equivalent oral dos vitamin D3 600 IU/day , 4200 IU/week 18,000 IU/month vitamin D status show daily dose effective weekly dose , monthly dose least effective . In India recent study evaluate common physician practice prescribe 1500 mcg ( 60 000 IU ) cholecalciferol per week 8 week VDD . Twenty-eight subject mean 25 hydoxy vitamin D level 13.5 nmol/l receive oral supplementation 1500 mcg cholecalciferol per week 1g elemental Ca daily 8 week . At 8 week vitamin deficiency correct patient mean mean 25 ( OH ) D level 82.4 nmol/l however 1 year follow subject vitamin D deficient mean 25 ( OH ) D level 24.7 nmol/l . This suggest ongoing supplementation initial loading need sustain improvement 25 ( OH ) D level vitamin D level . In another study Australia , single annual intramuscular injection 600,000 IU cholecalciferol administer 50 vitamin D-deficient participant . Specimens collect baseline 4 12 month therapy . Serum 25OHD3 level significantly high 4 month ( 114 ±35 nmol/L ) , 12 month ( 73 ±13nmol/L ) compare baseline ( 32 ±8nmol/L ) ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , increase average 128 % 12 month . The therapy effective , normalization serum 25OHD level maintenance level well 50nmol/L 12 month . In Pakistan oral vitamin D supplementation available combination calcium supplement maximum availability 400 IU . Two depot intramuscular preparation available one 200,000 IU 600,000 IU vitamin D3 . Regarding 600,000 unit preparation practice among physician vary , common practice give 600,000 unit intramuscularly every 03 month , physician prescribe second injection first month case severe deficiency physician prescribe 3 injection Vitamin D 2 weekly interval repeat 3 month need . Regarding 200,000 unit preparation , less commonly use , expensive preparation ; however advantage use orally well . There publish guideline mega dos depot preparation . The effect mega dos study investigator set practice base individual experience . The investigator strongly feel information regard effective correction vitamin deficiency currently available depot preparation lack investigator study help answer important relevant clinical query . The investigator second objective study find cost effective method monitor adequacy vitamin D replacement . While treatment vitamin D easy inexpensive , monitor vitamin D level expensive , widely available assay limitation term precision , accuracy measurement status vitamin D. The investigator plan measure urinary calcium excretion index adequacy vitamin D status determine correlation vitamin D level . Urine calcium reflection dietary intake , calcium absorption gut , bone turnover , renal excretion mechanism . At steady-state excretion usually approximately 30 % dietary intake . The efficiency absorption renal calcium intestinal calcium phosphorus increase presence vitamin D. Reports show increase intestinal calcium transport 45 65 % woman 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increase average 20 32 ng per milliliter ( 50 80 nmol per liter ) . Calciuria estimate calcium/creatinine ratio tend increase parallel 25 OH vitamin D level mostly study pediatric population give vitamin D prophylaxis rickets . In adult patient hypercalciuria renal stone formation positive correlation see vitamin D urinary calcium excretion . Seasonal variation vitamin D level urinary calcium excretion also describe . Gokce C et al find significant correlation random single void urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio 24-hour total calcium excretion 67 subject select prospectively represent wide range renal parathyroid function well urinary calcium phosphate loss . The investigator expect simple urine test follow evaluate vitamin D sufficiency state post vitamin D treat patient serve cost effective mean follow patient . Objectives : Primary Objective : To determine effect vitamin D replacement vitamin D level currently available preparation patient vitamin D deficiency . Secondary objective : To determine correlation vitamin D level urinary calcium excretion deficiency sufficiency state .</detailed_description>
