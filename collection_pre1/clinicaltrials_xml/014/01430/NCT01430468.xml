	<brief_summary>This non blind prospective randomize clinical trial define efficacy new technology develop Cleveland Clinic improve position glenoid component total shoulder arthroplasty . The Cleveland Clinic research team work development validation new technology last six year . The investigator validate pre-operative planning software publish result peer review literature ( 1 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) . The investigator use software plan total shoulder surgery last three year . The investigator validate accuracy reproducibility patient-specific instrumentation cadaver shoulder Sawbones model shoulder use multiple surgeon . These study also validate ability precisely measure component position use 3D CT scan image placement implant pre-clinical cadaver study , thereby validate ability accurately measure compare component position group describe proposed clinical trial . The investigator also prove ability software technique produce accurate representation glenoid morphology patient osteoarthritis rotator cuff deficient arthritis 13 patient . This IRB approve patient safety study perform Cleveland Clinic . The investigator perform extensive study material process fabrication , sterilization packaging patient specific instrument . The investigator select material process met FDA requirement use material process clinical device vivo . These device ( non implant instrument ) generally classified FDA Class I device significant clinical risk . The investigator study material process produce accurate instrument meet clinical specification fit onto surrogate glenoid surface maintain shape fit sterilization . These patient specific instrument test pre-clinical trial ( Sawbones Cadavers ) , demonstrate ability perform function specify high level accuracy much well use standard generic instrument .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient otherwise indicate primary reverse anatomic total shoulder replacement able get preoperative CT scan Cleveland Clinic consider eligible enrollment . All patient consent office part preoperative consent surgery need randomization time surgery Patients exclude significant metal joint result metal artifact CT scan , thereby compromise ability visualize glenoid preoperative simulator .</criteria>
