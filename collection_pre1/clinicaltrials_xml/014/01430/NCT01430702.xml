	<detailed_description>Care transition intervention successful reduce medication-related problem associate re-hospitalization primarily focus medication reconciliation conduct trained healthcare professional . Medication reconciliation process identify discrepancy drug regimens prescribe different care setting different time point within set , inform prescribing decision prevent medication-related problem , include medication error ( MEs ) adverse drug event ( ADEs ) . MEs ADEs particularly common follow hospitalization , multiple change patient ' medication regimen may accompany inadequate patient education , \ follow-up , continuity care primary care physician case manager . As result problem , many 42 % general medical patient experience ME ADE hospital discharge , disproportionate impact older adult chronic medical condition . Post-hospital ADEs expensive , as12 % result emergency department evaluation 5 % readmission , associate significant increase healthcare resource utilization fragmentation care . Programs improve medication reconciliation process largely effective , limitation include expense associate recruiting , training , retain care transition healthcare professional ( e.g. , nurse nurse practitioner ) , ability provide service within finite geographic area , retrospective nature reconciliation process , usually occur home follow hospital discharge . The investigator short-term objective use Pennsylvania Department Aging resource assess feasibility use telemedicine medication delivery unit frail older adult require medication assistance home immediately follow acute hospitalization . As part feasibility assessment , investigator assess several method intervention-related component .</detailed_description>
