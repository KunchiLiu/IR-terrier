	<detailed_description>There need development new preventive strategy help combat rise prevalence type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . This need particularly critical individual already show impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) incur great risk T2D CHD normal glucose level . Lifestyle change effective reduce fast glucose although change behavior challenge may among individual symptom depression . Evidence suggest elevate symptom depression significantly impact adiposity , level inflammatory biomarkers , early risk factor cardiometabolic condition . With exception , current lifestyle intervention 'one-size fit ' pay little attention patient ' individual goal , resource , barrier make positive behavior change lifestyle intervention address patient current mental state . By adopt 'patient-centered ' strategy , study test effectiveness Mindfulness-based Personalized health planning ( MB-PHP ) person prediabetes ( e.g. , define hemoglobin ( h ) A1c 5.7 % -6.4 % elevate symptoms depression . The MB-PHP incorporate four primary strategy : ( 1 ) individual risk quantification T2D cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) base hA1c level depressive symptom ; ( 2 ) group-based education behavioral traditional risk factor CVD T2D ; ( 3 ) development personalize health plan ( PHP ) emphasize lifestyle area patient willing ready change ; ( 4 ) support PHP implementation patient engagement integrative health partnering . To support goal PHP , mindfulness meditation use promote great awareness unity mind body specifically unconscious thought , feeling , behavior undermine achieve healthy lifestyle behavior .
