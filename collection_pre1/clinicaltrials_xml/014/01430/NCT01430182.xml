	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether , surgery tibia , one dose methadone provide good control pain afterward compare morphine , usual drug give control pain surgery . Immediately begin general anesthesia ( `` intraoperatively '' ) , subject receive one dose either methadone morphine , amount 0.2 milligram per kilogram body weight , intravenously . The primary hypothesis , subject receive one dose methadone intraoperatively require less pain medicine subject receive one dose morphine intraoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Methadone v Morphine Postoperative Pain Control Patients Undergoing Surgery Tibia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Satisfactory pain control generally achieve major surgery tibia combination enteral parenteral medication , neuraxial technique ( epidural analgesia ) , and/or regional technique ( sciatic femoral nerve block ) . Intramedullary nailing ( IMN ) open reduction/internal fixation ( ORIF ) tibia important exception , postoperative pain control difficult achieve case . Surgical repair fracture tibial shaft proximal tibia complicate compartment syndrome , possibility substantial morbidity loss function detect treat promptly . It always possible determine preoperatively tibial fracture high risk , low risk complication . The hallmark compartment syndrome , often early sign , pain proportion nature injury . This pain poorly relieve morphine strong analgesic . In contrast , peripheral nerve block , spinal , epidural completely block neural transmission nociceptive stimulus , obliterate important early warning sign . For reason , orthopedic surgeon often request anesthesiologist patient undergo IMN ORIF at-risk tibial fracture receive neuraxial block regional nerve block . As result , patient undergo IMN/ORIF tibia often receive poor pain relief deny treatment option , even though vast majority go develop compartment syndrome . A typical postoperative pain regimen IMN/ORIF tibia patient usually begin parenteral opioid morphine , along oral analgesic acetaminophen/hydrocodone ( `` Vicodin '' ) , acetaminophen/codeine ( `` Tylenol # 3 '' ) , tramadol . The parenteral opioid often give patient-controlled analgesia pump ( PCA ) , supplemental dos order breakthrough pain . A major disadvantage morphine equilibration half-time 2-4 hour . Thus considerable lag plasma morphine concentration ( peak immediately ) morphine concentration effector sit . This hysteresis result slow onset analgesia , peak analgesia occur 80-90 minute IV administration . It also result excessive somnolence , several demand dos row finally take effect . Morphine elimination half-time 2-3 hour . These repeat bolus dos result classic `` see-saw '' graph plasma morphine concentration time , peak troughs . Methadone , contrast , much low equilibration half-time , order 4-8 minute . This result quicker transfer methadone plasma effector site , hence quicker onset action , peak analgesia occur 11.3 minute . Methadone 's elimination half-life single dose approximately 24-36 hour , result prolonged analgesia , less re-dosing necessary . Most recently , multilevel thoracolumbar spine surgery instrumentation fusion , intraoperative intravenous methadone show substantial opioid-sparing effect compare intraoperative sufentanil bolus sufentanil infusion , similar rate side effect hypotension , respiratory depression , hypoxemia , arrhythmia , nausea , vomit . For reason , administer intraoperative loading dose 0.2 mg/kg methadone IV result well analgesia ORIF IMN tibia , compare intraoperative loading dose 0.2 mg/kg morphine IV . This dose methadone previously show yield plasma concentration Minimum Effective Concentration , without excessive respiratory depression . This dose show provide long-lasting analgesia painful procedure , often point subject need supplemental analgesic , non-narcotic analgesic .</detailed_description>
