This project cluster randomize control trial compare implementation MISSION-Vet augment GTO MISSION-Vet Implemented Usual ( IU ) three large HUD-VASH program country : VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System ( Northampton , MA ) , VA Capitol Health Care Network ( Washington , D.C. ) , VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System ( Denver , CO ) . This project randomly assign 150 HUD-VASH case manager 1106 Veterans caseloads receive HUD-VASH voucher case management service two group 1-year rolling admission basis determine Veteran receives housing voucher . The control group receive MISSION-Vet addition HUD-VASH case management service intervention group receive control , however HUD-VASH case manager access GTO implementation support . To compare case manager implement MISSION-Vet augmented GTO HUD-VASH case manager use IU strategy follow variable : ( 1 ) fidelity MISSION-Vet intervention ; ( 2 ) proportion time Veteran house ; ( 3 ) mental health , substance use , functional outcome among Veterans ; ( 4 ) factor key successful deployment new treatment specify Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , &amp; Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) model .
