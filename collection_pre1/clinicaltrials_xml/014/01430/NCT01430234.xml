	<brief_summary>Treatment exocrine insufficiency ( EPI ) consist pancreatic enzyme replacement accord fat intake . Prescribing sufficient dose pancreatic enzyme mandatory treatment effective . In addition , consultation specialize dietician pivotal educate patient proper use pancreatic enzyme . However , base recent prospective survey Netherlands amongst chronic pancreatitis patient , seem enzyme underused dietician seldom consult . The aim study assess difference efficacy pancreatic enzymes self-dosage regimen extensive patient-education comparison standard treatment patient EPI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , open , comparative study linear design two sequential phase ( observatory , patient-monitored ) . The research population consist patient treat pancreatic enzyme ( &lt; 6 capsule p/d contain 25,000 unit lipase ) exocrine insufficiency cause chronic pancreatitis . After inclusion , patient discontinue take pancreatic enzyme one week ( wash-out period ) . The last four day week , fecal fat balance test perform quantify fecal fat loss without enzyme correction . If fecal fat excretion le 15 % , consider normal therefore patient exclude study . Subsequently , next three week trial patient restart use dose pancreatic enzyme way prescribe inclusion . The last four day fourth week , fecal fat balance test repeat quantify fecal fat loss enzyme correction . After test intervention take place , consist standardised education patient dietician . In second phase four week , patient stimulate use information self-dose amount pancreatic enzyme accord fat content diet . In last week study fecal fat balance test repeat . The primary endpoint fecal fat excretion . Secondary endpoint change enzyme dose intervention , improvement complaint ( e.g . steatorrhoea related complaint , abdominal cramp , abdominal pain ) , change dietary habit , patient satisfaction , quality life , evaluation nutritional status , occurrence side effect . Because maximum amount 16 capsule pancreatic enzyme day accord standard guideline exceed trial , risk foresee . The anticipated benefit study patient treat effectively EPI . The burden trial patient repeat fecal fat balance test .</detailed_description>
