	<brief_summary>3 STUDY RATIONALE Based upon rationale , investigator propose phase I study combine Pazopanib TH-302 advance solid tumor . Pazopanib FDA approve dose 800mg per day . Using dose ensures consistency standard clinical use . It also ensure use dose likely induce maximal hypoxia , turn help ensure maximal local activation TH-302 ( hypoxia activate prodrug ) . TH-302 give monotherapy weekly dose 575 mg/m2 . When TH-302 combine full dos various chemotherapeutics , recommend dose TH-302 range 240 480 mg/m2 . Little overlapping toxicity TH-302 pazopanib expect . However ensure patient safety , start dose combination conservative use TH-302 dose find safe majority cytotoxic agent , 340 mg/m2 give day 1,8 , 15 every 28 day cycle . Using standard 3+3 design , investigator add increase dos TH-302 ( 340 mg/m2 , 480 mg/m2 , 575 mg/m2 give weekly , 3 week on/1 week ( standard TH-302 dosing schedule ) full monotherapy dose pazopanib ( 800 mg p.o daily ) expect accrual range 12-18 subject . Once recommended phase II dose identify , investigator enroll expand cohort approximately 12-18 ( i.e . total 30 subject overall ) patient well define tolerability study drug combination . 4 STUDY OBJECTIVES 4.1 Primary - To define maximal tolerate dose ( ) recommend phase II dose combination pazopanib plus TH-302 patient advance solid tumor 4.2 Secondary - To describe dose limit non dose-limiting toxicity drug combination</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN 5.1 Study Description This open-label , non-randomized phase I trial design assess safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase II dose ( RPTD ) TH-302 plus pazopanib adult subject advance solid tumor . Patients accrue ( enrol ) Duke University Medical Center . Accrued ( enrol ) subject define subject give inform consent . Approximately 50 subject may enrol ensure trial obtains approximately 30 evaluable subject . Evaluable subject define subject give informed consent , meet inclusion/exclusion screen criterion , receive study drug treatment complete first cycle safety assessment dose limit toxicity precludes complete full cycle assessment . Please note number accrue subject exceed number evaluable subject follow reason : 1 . Screen failure : Subjects inform consent meet inclusion/exclusion screen criterion . 2 . Treated patient : Subjects inform consent meet inclusion/exclusion criterion receive study drug treatment complete first cycle safety assessment primary study end point ( e.g . subject disease progression inter-current illness ) . There two stage Phase I study . Stage 1 dose escalation component determine safety recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) TH-302 plus pazopanib combination . Dose escalation begin cohort 1 continue describe Table 5.1 . Stage 2 expand cohort well describe tolerability toxicity profile ( 2 ) ass biomarkers related mechanism study agent . The treatment schedule follow : Table 5.1 Cohort Doses Cohort # subject Threshold 302 mg/m2 , intravenously Days 1 , 8 , 15 Pazopanib mg , orally daily - 1 3-6 240 800 Starting Dose 1 . 3-6 340 800 2 . 3-6 480 800 3 . 3-6 575 800 Expanded Cohort 12-18 RPTD 800 Subjects treat 28 day cycle satisfy eligibility screen criterion . Intermediate dosing level may explore . Toxicity assess every visit clinically indicate . Efficacy assess every 2 cycle clinically indicate . Dose Escalation Treatment Schema The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 use grade adverse event . The following adverse event consider dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) occur first cycle treatment deem related study treatment : - Hematologic toxicity : Any grade 4 neutropenia , thrombocytopenia anemia grade ≥ 3 neutropenia thrombocytopenia last 7 day - Any grade 3 thrombocytopenia associate bleed - Neutropenic fever - Nausea , Vomiting Diarrhea grade 3 last 4 day despite adequate supportive measure - Grade ≥ 3 ALT AST elevation &gt; 7 day - Other non-hematologic toxicity grade 3 exclude alopecia , anorexia , fatigue , hypertension , isolate lab abnormality ( clinically significant ) and/ rare , idiosyncratic reaction study drug . Anorexia , fatigue hypertension consider DLT reach grade 4 consider unmanageable . - Treatment delay ≥ 14 day cycle 2 due unresolved toxicity - Any treatment-related death treatment-related hospitalization Management dose modification associated adverse event outline Sections 9 10 . Dose escalation proceed Stage 1 within cohort accord follow scheme : Number Patients DLT Given Dose Level Escalation Decision Rule 0 3 Enter 3 subject next dose level . 1 3 Enter 3 subject dose level . &lt; 1 6 ( ) Proceed next dose level OR ( b ) This recommend MTD/RPTD high dose level . &gt; 2 3-6 Dose escalation stop . Three ( 3 ) additional subject enter next low dose level ( 3 subject treat level ) . - 3 subject advance solid tumor accrue start dose level . If DLTs see , 3 subject enrol next dose level . - Subjects monitor least one full cycle advancement next dose level . - If one three subject DLT give dose level , additional three subject enrol dose level . - If 1/6 subject experience DLT give dose level , escalation continue next dose level . - If ≥ 2 3-6 subject DLT dose level , dose level consider unacceptable toxicity , next low dose level expand 6 patient . In case , next low dose level declare MTD provide ≤ 1/6 subject DLT ( otherwise , dose de-escalated ) . In case toxicity see low dose level Grade ≤ 2 , re-escalation intermediate dosing consider . If uncertainty study drug attribution DLT re-escalation full dos also permit . - If &gt; 33 % subject DLT dose level , dose level consider unacceptable toxicity . The dose level immediately one unacceptable toxicity recommend phase II dose . - If unacceptable toxicity see high dose level , high dose regimen consider MTD phase II RPTD . - Up 6 subject enrol MTD good define tolerability safety proceed expand cohort .</detailed_description>
