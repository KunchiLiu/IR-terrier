	<detailed_description>Introduction The use ultrasonography adjunct regional anesthesia significantly increase recent year . Brachial plexus blockade axillary approach amenable use ultrasound guidance . Real time sonography nerve structure ensure optimal distribution block solution . When compare method nerve localization , sonography decrease : failure rate procedure time onset time blockade . Furthermore , use ultrasound peripheral nerve blockade demonstrate decreased procedure relate complication nerve injury unintentional vascular puncture . Traditional axillary block technique rely surface anatomical landmark require large volume local anesthetic , generally 40mL great . Utilizing increased accuracy offer ultrasound , study show low volume local anesthetic yield successful axillary plexus blockade . Therefore , tradition use large volume local anesthetic axillary block , even without ultrasound , may warrant . Although recent investigation support use low volume local anesthetic brachial plexus blockade , lack outcome data blind randomised trial . The primary objective study evaluate 2 different volume local anesthetic axillary blockade : 1 ) 20mL 2 ) 30 mL . For 2 different volume use study , 1.5 % solution mepivacaine choose due widespread clinical use axillary block , secondary : rapid onset action , intermediate duration effect , relative low cost . The primary outcome block success rate outpatient undergo distal upper limb surgery . Secondary objective include compare 2 volume respect : time require perform block , onset sensory motor blockade . Methods This pilot study prospective , double blind , randomize trial 64 patient recruit Detroit Receiving Hospital , Detroit , MI . All patient schedule undergo upper limb surgery outpatient set . Upon obtain write informed consent , patient randomly assign receive either 20mL ( n=31 ) 30mL ( n=33 ) 1.5 % mepivacaine solution axillary plexus blockade . All anesthetic block place use standard medical protocol . Nerve localization perform use GE LOGIQe ultrasound machine ( GE Medical system , Milwaukee , Wis , USA ) , 12L-RS transducer ( 42mm x 7mm footprint , 5-13 MHz ) . Following identification axillary neurovascular bundle , 22G x 50 mm poly medic UPC electric stimulation needle insert advanced along longitudinal axis ultrasound transducer entire shaft tip could visualize . A peri-arterial injection 1.5 % mepivacaine vicinity individual nerve sheath perform negative aspiration . The end point circumferential `` donut sign '' spread around artery . Additionally , musculocutaneous nerve identify 1.5 % mepivacaine inject around nerve . Depending patient group allocation either 20mL 30 mL total 1.5 % mepivacaine infiltrate . For group receive 20mL , 15 total 20 mL spread around axillary artery 5mL spread around musculocutaneous nerve . For group receive 30mL , 20 total 30 mL spread around axillary artery 10mL spread around musculocutaneous nerve . By institute injection technique , result could extrapolate non ultrasound guide axillary block . Inclusion Criteria All subject recruit study patient undergoing forearm , wrist , hand surgery , outpatient setting . Other attribute include : ASA I-III , BMI &lt; 35 , age 18-89 year . All subject history : CVA , diabetes , anxiety disorder , obstructive sleep apnea , previous surgery scar axillary elbow area , neurological impairment either upper extremity , allergies local anesthesia , coagulopathy , infection site block , chronic opioid therapy chronic pain , cast dress limb would impair assessment block . Pre-block sedation use &lt; 0.8mg/kg midazolam administration preoperative opioids . Block procedure time &lt; 10min . Subjects consent light intraoperative sedation . Data collection Preoperatively : Demographics , ASA ( marker surgical risk ) , height , weight , surgical procedure , location procedure ( hand , wrist , forearm ) , sedation use preoperative hold area , amount verse use , block start end time ( duration time take needle insertion extraction ) , onset sensory blockade , onset motor blockade . Intraoperatively : Conversion general anesthesia , use local anesthesia intraoperatively , total amount propofol administer , surgical incision time , surgery end time . Postoperative : Complications related axillary block . Discharge criterion meet . Onset Sensory blockade : Examined every 5 minute follow needle extraction use blunt needle 4 specific anatomic location correspond radial , ulnar , median , musculocutaneous distribution compare contralateral side use stimulus . Normal pinprick sharp , 3 ; pinprick felt sharp , 2 ; pressure felt pinprick felt , 1 ; sensation , 0 . Onset Motor Blockade : Examined every 5 minute follow needle extraction . Wrist flexion : median nerve ; wrist extension : radial nerve ; abduction 5th finger straight finger adduction : ulnar nerve ; elbow flexion ( forearm supinate ) : musculocutaneous nerve . Normal strength , 3 ; decrease strength move gravity resistance , 2 ; movement gravity twitch , 1 ; movement , 0 . Definitions successful block Functional successful block : Sensory score 0-1 4 territory motor score 0-1 3 4 territory within 30 minute needle extraction . Surgical successful block : require intraoperative supplemental local anesthetic , light sedation &lt; 25mcg/kg/min propofol absence general endotracheal anesthesia . Statistics An unpaired students-t-test procedure ( two-sample assume equal variance , two-tail significance p &lt; 0.05 , 95 % confidence interval ) perform examine mean difference 2 study group continuously scale variable . A repeated measure ANOVA use measure difference group time motor sensory nerve block score 6 measure time point ( 5 min , 10 min , 15 min , 20min , 25 min 30 min ) . Assumptions normality and/or homogeneity variance check verified . Comparisons study group proportional difference examine use non-parametric Fisher 's Exact Chi-square test , apply 2x2 2x3 table . Statistical significance set p-value â‰¤0.05 . All continuous data express mean 95 % upper low confidence interval .</detailed_description>
