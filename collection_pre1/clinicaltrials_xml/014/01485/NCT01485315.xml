	<detailed_description>Background Septic patient often receive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion intensive care unit . The evidence RBC transfusion lead improve outcome limit intervention may harmful patient . In contrast , current guideline recommend restrictive transfusion RBC critical ill patient without septic shock . To bridge gap clinical practice evidence , large randomise clinical trial need document efficacy safety RBC transfusion patient septic shock Design Pragmatic , multicenter , randomise , outcome assessment-blinded trial patient septic shock RBC transfusion haemoglobin ( Hb ) transfusion trigger 7 g/dl ( 4.4 mM ) 9 g/dl ( 5.6 mM ) , stratify presence haematological malignancy centre . Inclusion exclusion criterion : To increase validity trial inclusion criterion broad exclusion Outcome measure The outcome measure mainly patient-important ICU- hospital length stay also assess Trial size 2 x 500 patient need show 9 % absolute risk difference 90-day mortality ( baseline mortality 45 % , relative risk reduction 20 % ( septic patient TRICC trial ) , alpha 0.05 ( two-sided ) beta 0.20 power 80 % ( 1-beta ) . An interim-analysis perform 500 patient . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DMSC ) recommend trial stop group-difference 90-day mortality p &lt; 0.001 . Time Line The first patient expect randomise December 1st 2011 trial database expect close early 2014 . The main manuscript submit shortly thereafter . Funding The trial publicly fund Danish Strategic Research Council</detailed_description>
