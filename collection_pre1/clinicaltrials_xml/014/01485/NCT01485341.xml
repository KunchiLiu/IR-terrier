	<brief_summary>The idea evaluate call `` Gluten Sensitivity '' real clinical entity . Gluten sensitive ( GS ) person define patient , neither celiac allergic weat , develop symptom follow gluten consumption . This achieve evaluate global symptom score GS patient receive gluten compare receive placebo ( primary end point ) . Symptoms evaluate : gastrointestinal ( Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale , GSRS ) ; not-gastrointestinal ( specifically build evaluation scale ) ; VQV scale , build evaluate quality life . Gluten placebo administer daily ( 10 g ) 15 day ; 15 day 15 patient stay Gluten Free Diet ( GFD ) . Besides clinical evaluation ( week 6 week ) , intestinal permeability test blood sampling request identification possible marker ( serological , gut barrier function , immunological expression tight junction constitutive protein ) may help differentiate condition gluten sensitivity ( GS ) Celiac Disease ( CD ) ( secondary end point ) . Inclusion exclusion criterion patient enrol strictly dependant give `` Gluten sensitivity '' definition . We expect experience worsen gastrointestinal extra-gastrointestinal symptom , hour day , increase overall symptom score , cut , least 45 % GS subject enrol receive gluten compare GS receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gluten important protein component grain , notably wheat , rye , barley , basis variety flour wheat derive alimentary product consume throughout world ( bread , pasta , pizza etc ) . However `` engineering '' gluten-containing grain create condition human disease relate gluten exposure . These form gluten intolerance represent heterogeneous set condition , include wheat allergy , Gluten Sensitivity Celiac Disease , , combine , affect 10 % general population . The frequency not-celiac gluten intolerance however still unknown , even though possible condition undiagnosed under-diagnosed physician long time . The state immune responsiveness wheat antigen , represent complex process , establishment maintenance completely elucidate . The frequent disease cause wheat ingestion T cell-mediated disorder , IgE-mediated allergic reaction celiac disease ( CD ) . However , besides CD wheat allergy , case gluten reaction neither allergic autoimmune mechanism involve . These generally define gluten sensitivity ( GS ) . Some individual , experience distress eat gluten-containing product show improvement follow gluten-free diet , may GS instead CD . GS patient unable tolerate gluten develop adverse reaction eat gluten usually , differently CD , lead small intestinal damage . While gastrointestinal symptom GS may resemble associated CD , overall clinical picture generally less severe accompany concurrence tTG autoantibody autoimmune disease . Typically diagnosis make exclusion , elimination diet `` open challenge '' ( i.e. , monitor reintroduction gluten-containing food ) often use evaluate whether health improves elimination reduction gluten diet . This two major aim : 1 . Evaluation effective dependence gluten clinical alteration present subject gluten sensitivity ( GS ) . The study do period gluten-free diet ( washout 15 day ) , compare two group GS subject : give gluten placebo ( 15 day ) , follow period ( 15 day ) gluten free diet . 2. identification possible marker ( serological , gut barrier function , immunological expression tight junction constitutive protein ) may help differentiate , human , condition gluten sensitivity ( GS ) Celiac Disease ( CD ) ; marker might help early diagnosis GS versus CD especially case discordant serology .</detailed_description>
