	<criteria>Subject must document diagnosis form primary humoral immunodeficiency involve defect antibody formation require gammaglobulin replacement , define accord IUIS Scientific Committee 2009 diagnostic criterion accord Conley et al . The diagnosis must review Medical Director prior enrollment . Subject 2 year old time screen . Written inform consent obtain either subject subject 's legally authorize representative prior studyrelated procedure study product administration . Subject receive consistent dose immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) nonBaxter product ( Gammunex administer IV , Hizentra , Privigen ) , administer compliance respective product information , period least 3 month prior screen . The average minimum prestudy dose interval equivalent 300 mg/kg BW/4 week maximum dose equivalent 600 mg/kg BW/4 week dose frequency follow : For IV treatment prior study : mean interval 3 4 week ( +/ 3 day ) For SC treatment prior study : mean interval approximately 1 2 week ( +/ 2 day ) . Subject serum trough level IgG &gt; 5 g/L screening . Subject serious bacterial infection within 3 month prior screen . If female childbearing potential , subject present negative pregnancy test agree employ adequate birth control measure duration study . Subject willing able comply requirement protocol . Subject known history positive screen one following : hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , PCR human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Type 1/2 . Abnormal laboratory value screen meet one follow criterion ( abnormal test may repeat determine persistent ) : Persistent alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate amino transferase ( AST ) &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal test laboratory Persistent severe neutropenia ( define absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] &lt; = 500/mm3 ) . Subject creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) value &lt; 60 % normal age gender either measure , calculate accord genderspecific formula provide study protocol . Subject diagnose malignancy ( adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix ) , unless diseasefree period prior screen exceeds 5 year Subject receive anticoagulation therapy history thrombotic episode ( include deep vein thrombosis , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , pulmonary embolism ) within 12 month prior screen history thrombophilia . Subject abnormal protein loss ( protein lose enteropathy , nephrotic syndrome ) . Subject anemia would preclude phlebotomy laboratory study , accord standard practice site . Subject ongoing history hypersensitivity persistent reaction ( urticaria , breathe difficulty , severe hypotension , anaphylaxis ) follow IV immunoglobulin , SC immunoglobulin , and/or Immune Serum Globulin ( ISG ) infusion . Subject immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency ( IgA less 0.07g/L ) know anti IgA antibody . Subject know allergy hyaluronidase . Subject preventative ( prophylactic ) systemic antibacterial antibiotic dose sufficient treat prevent bacterial infection , stop antibiotic time screen . Subject active infection receive antibiotic therapy treatment infection time screen . Subject bleed disorder platelet count less 20,000/Î¼L , , opinion investigator , would significant risk increase bleed bruise result SC therapy . Subject total protein &gt; 9 g/dL myeloma , macroglobulinemia ( IgM ) paraproteinemia . Women childbearing potential meeting one follow criterion : Subject present positive pregnancy test Subject breast feeding Subject intend begin nurse course study Subject agree employ adequate birthcontrol measure ( e.g . intrauterine device , diaphragm condom [ male partner ] spermicidal jelly foam , birth control pills/patches ) throughout course study . Subject participate another clinical study expose investigational product ( IP ) device within 30 day prior study enrollment ( exception : treatment immunoglobulin prestudy ) . Subject schedule participate another ( nonBaxter ) clinical study involve IP device course study . Subject severe dermatitis would preclude adequate site safe product administration .</criteria>
