	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Efficacy 7 Days Treatment With Novel Analgesic Subjects With Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial evaluate effectiveness novel analgesic peripheral neuropathic pain mixed patient population . Participants treat one week randomly assign novel analgesic , pregabalin , placebo . Pain characterized end period . This trial require participant stay investigational site 14 consecutive day . The enrollment visit take place Day -28 Day -16 . Participants taper exist medication Visit 2 ( Day -17 Day -5 ) Visit 3 give rescue medication ( paracetamol/acetaminophen ) . At Visit 3 participant hospitalize ( Day -4 ) . The baseline evaluation period take place Day -3 Day -1 . Randomization one three treatment arm possible last assessment Day - 1 alternatively randomization take place Day 1 . This follow double-blind treatment period ( Day 1 Day 7 ) . The participant follow-up thereafter day 36 ( Day 34 38 ) . Participants permit resume previous medication .</detailed_description>

Allowed reason neuropathic pain : modified radical mastectomy , breast conserving surgery , cosmetic breast surgery . [ Germany : subject cosmetic breast surgery may enrol . ] Presence `` probable '' `` definite '' neuropathic pain . Presence dynamic mechanical allodynia affect side , alternatively , mechanical pain sensitivity pinprick stimulus higher affected compare contralateral side . At either Visit 5 Visit 6 : Presence average evoke pain intensity score &gt; 20 0 100 point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) least 1 3 clinical subtests dynamic mechanical allodynia ( i.e. , standardize brush , cotton wool tip cotton wisp ) . The average calculated arithmetic mean measurement per sub test . Alternatively , arithmetic mean 5 test replicates pinprick stimuli mechanical pain sensitivity least 3 time higher affected side compare contralateral side . Presence average ongoing pain intensity score &gt; 4 &lt; 9 010 point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) without use rescue medication within 3 day Baseline pain intensity evaluation Period least 7 9 assessment present . Dissatisfaction current treatment ( i.e. , lack efficacy intolerable side effect ) take opioid non opioid analgesic medication painful neuropathy enrollment . Any kind hepatic impairment Visit 1 Visit 3 . Either active hepatitis within past 3 month presence chronic hepatitis irrespective activity status . Estimated creatinine clearance le 60 mL/minute x 1.73 m2 either Visit 1 Visit 3 . Clinically relevant cardiac disease ( e.g. , unstable angina pectoris , angina pectoris Canadian Cardiovascular Society [ CCS ] Grade III IV , acute myocardial infarction within last 3 month , cardiac insufficiency New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV ) .

Clinically relevant pulmonary disease ( e.g. , Medical Research Council breathlessness scale 2 ) . Specific antitumor therapy within last 6 month , e.g. , adjuvant radiotherapy chemotherapy , biologics , angiogenesis inhibitor . CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype predict CYP2D6 genotyping . Presence confound pain condition ( e.g. , ulnar nerve entrapment , radial nerve injury associate major softtissue bone damage , cervicothoracic radiculopathy , carpal tunnel syndrome , chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy , complex regional pain syndrome type I type II ) . Phantom breast phantom limb pain . Presence exclusively negative symptom neuropathic pain ( e.g. , hypoesthesia total anesthesia ) affect area .</criteria>
