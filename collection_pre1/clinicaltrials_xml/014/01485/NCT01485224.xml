	<brief_summary>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) ( OMIM 187300 600376 ) , also know Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome , autosomal dominant disease prevalence 1:5000 1:8000 different population . Clinically , occurrence mucocutaneous gastrointestinal telangiectasias systemic arteriovenous malformation commonly observe . Recurrent severe epistaxis , due presence telangiectasias nasal mucosa , common presentation HHT , frequently lead severe anemia require intravenous iron blood transfusion . Although life threatening , severe epistaxis great impact quality life HHT patient represent important impediment daily activity , pose therapeutic challenge . Recently , angiogenesis implicate pathogenesis HHT . Circulating concentration TGF-beta vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) significantly elevate therefore , anti-angiogenic substance may effective treatment vascular malformation disease . Thalidomide function potent immunosuppressive antiangiogenic agent . The aim study assess clinical effect thalidomide therapy severity epistaxis subject HHT refractory standard therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Thalidomide Treatment Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In management HHT epistaxis , multiple approach try , include electrocautery , laser , embolization , arterial ligation , approach largely palliative variable result , many require repeated intervention . Except nasal closure , surgical option offer , best , limited hemorrhage-free interval , definitive result side effect . Moreover , currently , establish medical treatment available patient . To limit blood loss , medical treatment use include manipulation coagulation fibrinolytic pathway topical application anti-inflammatory drug . However , multiple lesion disseminate entire mucosal surface common affected individual , make local treatment difficult . Re-bleeding consumes disproportionate share healthcare resource devote multiple admission , repeat endoscopy blood transfusion . Recently , angiogenesis implicate pathogenesis HHT . Circulating concentration TGF-beta vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) significantly elevate therefore , anti-angiogenic substance may effective treatment vascular malformation disease . Thalidomide function potent immunosuppressive antiangiogenic agent inhibit phagocytic ability inflammatory cell production cytokine , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) . It show effective treatment inflammatory disease , condition associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , various cancer . Bleeding inhibition observe HHT patient receive thalidomide antiangiogenic cancer therapy . A recent paper report thalidomide treatment induced vessel maturation experimental model HHT reduce severe nosebleed six seven HHT patient study . On hand , spectacular improvement describe patient intestinal angiodysplasias , treat thalidomide . In isolated case report , patient severe recurrent intestinal bleeding refractory standard treatment achieve prolonged complete remission thalidomide dose 100 300 mg/day month tolerance good . Cessation bleed associate reduction serum VEGF level . These observation suggest thalidomide might useful treatment HHT patient address significant unmet medical need . Unfortunately , drug expose patient risk severe side effect . Drug metabolism control number enzyme specific drug ; among enzyme , many show variable level activity thus recognize population extensive ( high fast ) metabolizers ( EM ) intermediate ( IM ) poor ( low slow ) metabolizers ( PM ) . This true also thalidomide , whose metabolism part control enzyme CYP2C19 . The aim study test hypothesis thalidomide reduce bleed tendency HHT patient verify extent CYP2C19 polymorphism modulate response treatment side effect .</detailed_description>
