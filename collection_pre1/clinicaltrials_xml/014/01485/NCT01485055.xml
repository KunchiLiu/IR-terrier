	<brief_summary>Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) serious medical condition common development Bone Marrow Transplant ( BMT ) . Acute GVHD happen donor cell attack damage tissue organs transplant . Acute GVHD often cause : Skin rash , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , diarrhea ( may blood ) , liver damage cause inflammation liver jaundice ( yellow skin eye ) , damage organ Steroids first line treatment acute GVHD . About quarter patient develop acute GVHD may respond steroid steroid refractory GVHD ( SR-aGVHD ) . Patients SR-aGVHD may need medication . SR-aGVHD , potentially life threaten condition . There standard treatment may respond treatment . The goal study find Infliximab basiliximab treat SR-aGVHD . Participants study receive combination therapy ( 2 drug : infliximab basiliximab ) week four week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab Basiliximab Treatment Steroid Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids standard initial therapy Acute GvHD ( aGVHD ) HSCT ( hematopoietic stem cell transplant aka BMT ) 25-41 % patient respond prednisone ( methylprednisolone ) dose 2mg/kg/day . Complete response aGvHD important predictor survival ; patient respond steroid , survival around 50 % , low 11 % non-responders . Patients develop aGvHD normally discharge 4-5 week HSCT . However patient aGvHD may need admit require prolonged hospitalization . Patients , respond treatment , usually worsen skin symptom , protract diarrhea vomit lead severe life threaten dehydration . Secondary bacterial , fungal and/or viral infection common may eventually die multiorgan failure . There consensus definition steroid refractory ( SR ) aGvHD , generally aGvHD consider SR , progression GvHD 3 day response 7 day treatment 2mg/kg/day methyl prednisolone . There standard care patient treatment varies institution institution . Salvage regimens SR GvHD include high dose steroid , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , monoclonal antibody ( infliximab , daclizumab , basiliximab etc . ) , pentostatin , mesenchymal stem cell immunotoxins . Generally manifestation aGvHD worsen 3 day start steroid , improvement within 5 day , unlikely response achieve secondary therapy initiate . High dose steroid associate improvement response rate SR aGvHD . In prospective trial compare 2mg/kg/day 10mg/kg/day methylprednisolone 94 patient grade II-IV aGvHD , response rate , progression grade III-IV disease , non- relapse mortality ( NRM ) overall survival similar treatment group . In addition high dose steroid associate many acute long term complication . Hyperglycemia , hypertension , infection , aseptic necrosis neurological complication commonly see . Outcome patient SR aGvHD poor . Only 7/57 ( 12 % ) patient achieve CR ( complete Response ) secondary therapy aGvHD report Weisdorf et al 4/45 ( 9 % ) patient receive high dose methylprednisolone secondary therapy respond . ATG extensively use treatment SR GvHD CR rate 14-20 % report . Rationale use Infliximab Basiliximab : The pathophysiology GvHD triphasic involve tissue damage condition regimen , follow donor T cell activation lead effector phase cytokine dysregulation . The cytokine interleukin ( IL ) 2 tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) play central role mediate tissue damage cause proliferation activate alloreactive T cell . Over last year monoclonal antibody use treat patient monotherapy recently combination therapy promising result . The anti-CD25 MoAb - daclizumab provide competitive inhibition bind IL-2 high affinity α subunit IL2 receptor . It use monotherapy steroid refractory aGvHD promise result . TNF another cytokine involve GvHD early study anti-TNF-α administration show encouraging result . Antibodies TNF ( infliximab ) TNF receptor ( etanercept ) develop . Infliximab block interaction TNF-and receptor cause lysis cell produce TNF- . Srinivasan et al use infliximab daclizumab combination therapy patient develop SR GvHD non myeloablative HSCT adult patient . All 12 patient treated combination therapy complete resolution GvHD involve organ . The Kaplan-Meier probability survival 100 % 100 day 73 % 200 day transplantation . Rao et al study use regimen ( infliximab daclizumab ) pediatric population underwent HSCT immunodeficiency . In study 86 % ( 19/22 ) patient respond median response time 15 day start monoclonal antibody therapy . 12/22 ( 54 % ) CR , 7/22 ( 32 % ) PR 3 patient response treatment . At median follow-up 31 month 68 % patient alive . As Jan 2010 Daclizumab available due manufacturer related issue . Basiliximab another chimeric murine-human IL-2 receptor antagonist , half-life around 7 day . It 's mechanism action similar daclizumab use SR GVHD monotherapy . Massenkeil et al study 17 patient steroid refractory GvHD show 53 % patient complete response , 18 % partial response 29 % response . Recently Funke et al study 34 patient SR GvHD , show CR rate 84 % skin , 48 % gut 26 % patient liver GvHD . However difficult compare one study another due lack uniformity response definition , dose schedule number dos use . The high CR rate survival study Srinivasan Rao et al possibly due follow factor : 1 . Use combination therapy monoclonal antibody , selectively inhibit alloreactive T cell target 2 different cytokine involve pathophysiology GvHD ; 2 . Rapid taper steroid , thereby decrease steroid induced side effect like infection ; 3 . Prophylactic use antimicrobial ( antibiotic antifungal ) close monitor viral reactivation . These factor lead decrease infection relate morbidity mortality population heavily immunosuppressed patient ; thus contribute improve survival study . Overall CR rate SR GvHD range 9 % 54 % median 26 % . Mostly result base single center experience , small sample size , study comparable . There standard care ; however infliximab may use monotherapy diagnosis SR GvHD make . The promising treatment infliximab daclizumab possible give due unavailability daclizumab January 2010 . Basiliximab use combination therapy monoclonal antibody . Combination therapy infliximab basiliximab target two different point cytokine cascade selectively control proliferation activate T cell . As combination use difficult predict safety efficacy profile .</detailed_description>
