	<detailed_description>This study compare effect gabapentin alone , gabapentin + donepezil give together two type experimental electrical pain test conduct forearm low leg , 24 healthy male subject initially . Gabapentin ( drug treatment seizure disorder ) one drug use treatment pain cause damage nerve . Donepezil treatment improve memory patient Alzheimer 's disease . 24 subject may recruit follow formal analysis trial ( call interim analysis ) , require optimal scientific value . The study consist 1 screen visit,1 visit establish baseline pain recording treatment give , 3 treatment session , follow followup visit . Each treatment session consist 12 day dose home 2 inpatient day dose pain test . Each volunteer take part 3 treatment session . In total , study last 15 week volunteer . There 4 treatment option : placebo , high dose gabapentin , low dose gabapentin , low dose gabapentin + donepezil . All subject receive last two option one first two option , random order select computer study starts; neither volunteer person conduct pain assessment study team know treatment volunteer receive visit ( know randomise , double−blind study ) . The study conduct specialist clinical research unit adequate facility regard safety compliance . The result test study help understand effect gabapentin donepezil together design future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
