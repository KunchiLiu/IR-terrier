	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : Run-in Phase : Determine dose EP-100 initial benefit/risk paclitaxel combine EP-100 study . Randomized Phase : Compare anti-tumor effect EP-100 combine weekly paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone patient ovarian cancer . Secondary Objectives : Randomized Phase : Quantify significant change safety profile weekly paclitaxel alone compare doublet combination paclitaxel EP-100 . Determine initial benefit/risk profile new drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EP-100 Plus Paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel Alone Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total duration study participant 9 10 month , consist 1 month screen period , 6 7 month treatment period , 30 day follow-up . All patient stable disease achieve partial complete response dose safe reasonably well-tolerated may continue additional treatment cycle regimen . Any patient whose image assessment show disease progression receive least two cycle single agent weekly paclitaxel ARM 1 may offer treatment combination EP-100 plus paclitaxel dose regimen ARM 2 .</detailed_description>
