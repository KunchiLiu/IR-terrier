	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To demonstrate upper extremity training Armeo system sense glove result great functional improvement measure clinical functional outcome measure , Armeo train grip sensor , chronic post-stroke population impair upper extremity function . 2 . To compare kinematic data follow training grip sensor vs. sense glove , use data provide Armeo system , clinical outcome measure data derive analysis upper extremity movement use camera-based motion analysis system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Upper Arm Training With Armeo Spring Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By use Armeo system , investigator hope achieve repetitive training reach , grasp , release engage environment adapt individual capability , enable stroke survivor whose motor weakness may exclude perform repetitive therapy task , participate study.The Armeo system adjustable arm orthosis receive FDA 510k exemption . It passively counterbalance weight arm , thereby reduce effort require paretic arm overcome gravity . The device able augment feedback virtual environment ( i.e . computer game ) . The task present virtual environment design achieve functional movement , i.e . subject perform task reach object part game . The ability reach grasp necessary component many daily-life functional task . Impaired reach grasp follow stroke result recruitment compensatory measure increase use trunk transport hand . As end-effector , grip sensor provide point attachment , compare glove , hand free . The posture hand , range movement , joint adaptation , movement pattern kinematics likely affect free fix end-effector . In study , investigator would like compare efficacy train end-effectors . The investigator also compare efficacy 2 end-effectors high-functioning vs low-functioning hemiparetic subject .</detailed_description>
