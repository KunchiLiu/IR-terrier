	<brief_title>A Study HSP90 Inhibitor AUY922</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive AUY922 vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Study Visits : On Days 1 15 Cycles 1-12 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 6-7 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood also use check heart function . - You ECGs study drug infusion . On Day 8 Cycles 1-12 : - Your vital sign measure . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 6-7 teaspoon ) draw routine test check heart function . - You ECGs study drug infusion . On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - Urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check blood clot function . On Days 2 3 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 5-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECGs 24 48 hour end infusion . - You ask drug may take , side effect may , overall health . On Day 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may , overall health . - Blood ( 5-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . After every 2 cycle : - You CT PET scan check status disease . - You ask side effect may overall health . Anytime study doctor think need , eye exam test . Length Study : You may continue take AUY922 12 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : At 28 day last dose : - Blood ( 5-6 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check blood clot function . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You eye exam eye doctor . - You CT PET scan check status disease . - You ask drug may take , side effect may , overall health . Long-Term Follow-Up : After stop study drug , CT scan physical exam every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month another year , every 6 month 3 year 1 time year . This investigational study . AUY922 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
