	<brief_summary>Background : - Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) approve treatment Parkinson disease . It stimulate part brain help control symptom like tremor , stiffness , slow movement . However , many people continue unsteadiness slowness walking , trouble swallowing , speech problem even STN DBS . Another type DBS focus part brain call pedunculopontine nucleus ( PPN ) . PPN DBS improve walk people Parkinson 's disease . Researchers want see combine two type DBS may help control symptom good STN DBS alone . Objectives : - To see PPN DBS help walking , balance , speaking , swallow already STN DBS . - To study DBS combination affect brain function . Eligibility : - Individuals Parkinson disease STN DBS surgery least 1 year ago , still difficulty walking , swallow , speak . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also neurological test test measure Parkinson disease symptom . - This study require eight visit 1 year . One visit 9- 10-day admission NIH Clinical Center DBS surgery . - Participants PPN DBS surgery . The surgery do two step . In first step , lead place brain . In second step , 1 week later , stimulator device place chest abdomen . - One month surgery , participant study visit program PPN DBS device find setting improve walk balance . - Participants study visit 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month surgery . Each visit use check stimulators make adjustment need try improve walk balance lessen side effect . Participants test walk balance , speech , swallow . Some test do different combination stimulators see effect set stimulators .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : 1 . Determine bilateral Pedunculo-Pontine Nucleus ( PPN ) Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) improve gait balance problem Parkinson Disease ( PD ) patient whose disease feature respond bilateral subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) DBS medication 2 . Determine bilateral PPN DBS improve swallow function Parkinson Disease patient treat bilateral STN DBS medication 3 . Obtain electrophysiological data relate PPN 4 . Obtain data related physiological relationship STN PPN STUDY POPULATION : Three ( 3 ) subject clinically diagnose PD undergone bilateral STN DBS least one year prior enrollment , continue gait balance disturbance . DESIGN : Pilot study 3 patient clinically diagnose PD undergone bilateral STN DBS least one year prior enrollment . Baseline evaluation include neurologic clinical evaluation , postural gait physiologic clinical assessment , brain imaging , video swallow evaluation . The patient undergo surgical procedure ( bilateral PPN DBS implant ) Clinical Center ( CC ) . Electrode recording obtain implant site within first week post-operatively externalized lead , second surgical stage ( pulse generator implant ) take place , also Clinical Center . The patient undergo program optimal parameter appropriate follow-up , outcome measure assess 1 week 1 , 3 , 6 12 month post-surgery . Recruitment stagger least 4 week require different patient begin study . Recruitment halt major unexpected side-effects occur cause concern welfare patient . This study serve basis extend , large study , would properly power answer clinical research question . The efficacy criterion translation large study 30 % improvement primary outcome 2 3 patient . In addition , obtain valuable part novel data regard electrophysiologic property PPN complex interaction basal ganglion ( BG ) component parkinsonian state response DBS . The data obtain study inform design , selection treatment paradigms future large study . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary : - Change amount time need complete standardized time go ( TUG ) study 6 month post-surgery stimulation - Change amount time need complete standardized time go ( TUG ) study 6 month post-surgery stimulation , compare stimulation . Secondary : - Change time need complete TUG study 1 , 3 12 month post-surgery stimulation - UPDRS part III score UPDRS part III point 27-30 1 , 3 , 6 12 month stimulation - Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ 31 ) quality life questionnaire 6 month - Change static dynamic posturography outcome parameter 1 , 3 , 6 12 month stimulation - Number adverse event follow-up period - Change time non-timed variable swallow function 6 month - Recorded physiologic function PPN STN stimulator rest gait - Changes patient global impression change 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month . All outcome measure assess best medical therapy..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : . Greater 22 year age ii . Successful bilateral STN DBS implant least 1 year iii . At least 30 % improvement motor UPDRS follow STN therapy , history record review iv . Improved UPDRS self assessment questionnaire follow STN DBS least 20 % , history record review . v. Good STN DBS placement assess imaging ( CT scan , MRI fuse CTMRI image ) vii . Persistent gait disturbance ascertain abnormal performance timeupandgo test compare agematched control well preoperative evaluation posturography quantitative gait assessment ( value compare normal agematched control ) least 30 % difference agematched control either measure . vii . Persistent speech swallow problem measure minimum score I item 5 7 UPDRS viii . Evaluation independent movement disorder specialist confirm gait disturbance presence STN stimulation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : . Pregnant nursing woman ii . Cognitively impaired subject determine preoperative neuropsychology evaluation , include Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( DRS ) . Patients score 70 Mattis DRS exclude . iii . Depressed subject determine neuropsychology screen , include Beck Depression Inventory . Patients score 20 Beck inventory exclude . iv . Patients uncontrolled coexist medical condition : uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; heart disease need intervention ; respiratory disease need intervention ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality need therapeutic anticoagulation interrupt ; condition would render patient unable safely cooperate study test judge screen physician . v. Patients metal object body MRI compatible , exclude previous STN DBS hardware vi . Patients history seizure , require repeat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan cranial neurosurgical procedure since receive STN implant .</criteria>
