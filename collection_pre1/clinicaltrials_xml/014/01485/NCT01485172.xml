	<brief_summary>This study fix dose , dose response study characterize dose response ropinirole PR early stage PD patient ( Hoehn &amp; Yahr stag I-III ) . After screen baseline assessment , subject randomize one six final target treatment group ( placebo , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24mg/day ropinirole PR ) . The study consist screening period , up-titration period , maintenance period , titration period follow period . This study utilize change baseline UPDRS motor score primary endpoint , line use ropinirole PR monotherapy pivotal study ( SK &amp; F101468/168 ) . Clinical review primary secondary endpoint perform order establish low maximally effective therapeutic dose .</brief_summary>

A baseline UPDRS motor score least 10 . Limited prior exposure low moderate dos LDOPA ( 3 month total ) dopamine agonist include ropinirole ( 6 month total ) allow provide treatment discontinue minimum 4 week prior screen . Provide write informed consent study . Be willing able comply study procedure . Subjects Parkinson 's disease dopaminergic therapy warrant time screen . Subjects severe , clinically significant condition ( ) Parkinson 's disease , opinion investigator , render subject unsuitable study ( e.g. , psychiatric , haematological , renal , hepatic , endocrinology , neurological [ Parkinson 's disease ] , cardiovascular , active malignancy [ basal cell carcinoma ] ) . Subjects cripple degenerative arthritis physical mental condition preclude accurate assessment efficacy safety . Subjects prior current major psychosis ( e.g. , schizophrenia psychotic depression ) e.g . score 3 4 UPDRS item 2 [ think disorder ] item 3 [ depression ] . Subjects severe clinical dementia e.g . score 3 4 UPDRS item 1 [ mentation ] . Subjects severe dizziness fainting due postural hypotension stand . Subjects personal history melanoma . Subjects clinically significant abnormality laboratory ECG test Screening . If finding outside normal range subject include , must document investigator finding clinical significance . Subjects diagnose impulse control disorder . The modified MIDI conduct screen . Subjects score positive screen must refer specialist diagnostic evaluation prior enrol ( screen ) study . Subjects active suicidal plan/intent active suicidal thought past 6 month . Subjects history suicide attempt last 2 year 1 lifetime suicide attempt . Current alcohol drug dependence . Definite suspect personal family history clinically significant adverse reaction hypersensitivity ropinirole ( drug similar chemical structure ) would preclude longterm dose ropinirole . Withdrawal , introduction , change dose hormone replacement therapy and/or drug know substantially inhibit CYP1A2 ( e.g . ciprofloxacine , fluvoxamine , cimetidine , ethinyloestradiol ) induce CYP1A2 ( e.g . tobacco , omeprazole ) within 7 day prior baseline ( randomization ) . Subjects chronic therapy agent may enrol dos must remain stable 7 day prior baseline ( randomization ) end treatment period . Smokers maintain normal smoking habit . Women pregnant breastfeeding .
