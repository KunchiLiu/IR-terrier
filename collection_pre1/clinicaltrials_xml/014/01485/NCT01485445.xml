	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine bioequivalence fluticasone furoate ( FF ) inhalation powder ( single strip configuration ) compare FF inhalation powder ( two strip configuration ) compare FF / vilanterol ( VI ) inhalation powder . Fluticasone furoate ( FF ) , develop monotherapy treatment asthma combination vilanterol ( VI ) treatment asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Thirty healthy male female subject enrol study ensure twenty-four evaluable subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Compare Fluticasone Furoate ( FF ) 1-strip Inhaler With FF 2-strip Inhaler With FF/Vilanterol Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluticasone furoate ( FF ; GW685698 ) , novel corticosteroid , develop monotherapy treatment asthma combination vilanterol ( VI ; GW642444 ) treatment asthma COPD . The novel dry powder inhaler ( NDPI ) use deliver FF monotherapy FF/VI combination . The NDPI use either single strip two strip , single strip use FF monotherapy two strip use deliver FF/VI combination . In previous FF monotherapy study , include phase IIB programme , conduct use NDPI , inhaler contain two strip ( FF first strip match VI placebo second strip ) . This two strip configuration use majority FF monotherapy treatment arm previous ongoing study . The aim study determine bioequivalence FF monotherapy ( single strip ) compare FF monotherapy ( two strip ) , determine bioequivalence FF monotherapy ( single strip ) compare FF/VI , administer via NDPI . This data facilitate inclusion FF monotherapy ( two strip ) data FF/VI combination data support FF monotherapy product development . This randomised , open-label , replicate , six-way crossover , single dose study healthy male female subject . Thirty healthy male female subject enrol study ensure twenty-four evaluable subject . Pharmacokinetic sample take 36 hour . Safety assess adverse event ( AE ) monitoring throughout study .</detailed_description>
