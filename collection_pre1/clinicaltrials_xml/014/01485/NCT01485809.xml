	<brief_summary>Gefitinib first epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) approve treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Results two randomised phase II trial ( IDEAL 1 2 ) suggest gefitinib efficacious less toxic , compare previous result , chemotherapy patient previously-treated non-small-cell lung cancer . Two phase III trial gefitinib advanced non-small-cell lung cancer follow IDEAL phase II study : Iressa Survival Evaluation Lung cancer ( ISEL ) Iressa NSCLC Trial Evaluating REsponse Survival versus Taxotere ( INTEREST ) . Although phase III ISEL trial fail prove superiority gefitinib treatment compare placebo previously treat patient , subgroup analysis demonstrate improved survival particular population ( Asians non-smokers ) . The INTEREST study compare EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor chemotherapy pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer . In INTEREST , survival similar gefitinib docetaxel almost subgroup ; EGFR-related biomarker clinical factor ( include female sex , adenocarcinoma histology , never-smoker , Asian ethnicity ) appear predictive great survival benefit gefitinib versus docetaxel . However , factor may still predictive great survival benefit gefitinib and/or docetaxel versus best supportive care ; alternatively , may good prognostic factor . Progression free survival overall response rate statistically significant difference gefitinib docetaxel . This suggest gefitinib provide similar overall survival docetaxel pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patient . These study demonstrate gefitinib effective second-line treatment NSCLC . Now , gefitinib recommend advanced metastatic NSCLC second-line chemotherapy . But , prospective study gefitinib NSCLC wih squamous cell histology . This trial investigate efficacy safety gefitinib locally advance , metastatic NSCLC patient squamous cell histology fail first-line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
