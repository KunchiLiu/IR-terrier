	<brief_title>Safety Study Nelfinavir + Cisplatin + Pelvic Radiation Therapy Treat Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite cisplatin chemoradiation , 40-50 % woman locally advanced cervical cancer die disease . The evaluation new chemoradiation regimen since include cisplatin build current success . In one year , Nelfinavir patent become potential cost effective therapy . HIV Protease inhibitor explore potential therapy oncology . The reposition HIV protease inhibitor , specifically nelfinavir cancer therapeutic , base three fact . First , recent study show HIV protease inhibitor establish broad-spectrum anti-cancer agent work pleiotropic mechanism down-regulating activate mitogenic signaling pathway , activate immune response Nelfinavir potent [ 7 ] . Second , HIV protease inhibitor include nelfinavir target specific viral antigen . Nelfinavir show target Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) -transformed cervical carcinoma cell via inhibition E6-mediated proteosomal degradation mutant p53 [ 8 ] . Thirdly , Nelfinavir radiosensitizing property inhibit PI3K/Akt signal pathway demonstrate vivo vitro head neck pancreatic cancer model [ 9 ] . Nelfinavir currently evaluate radiosensitizer head neck pancreatic cancer phase I/II clinical trial . Brunner et al . ( 2008 ) recently complete first phase I trial nelfinavir add chemoradiation locally advanced pancreatic cancer [ 16 ] . Investigators treat 12 patient advanced pancreatic carcinoma Nelfinavir 1250 mg orally twice daily start 3 day radiation therapy continue last day radiation . They find significant toxicity attributable nelfinavir observe response rate 50 % versus 30 % historical control . There 5 12 patient grade 3 hematologic toxicity ( 4 leukopenia 2 thrombocytopenia ) . There 3 12 patient grade 3 GI toxicity ( include abdominal pain , nausea , vomit ) . There grade 4 drug relate toxicity [ 16 ] . There grade 1/ 2 toxicity include hematologic ( thrombocytopenia , anemia , neutropenia ) , gastrointestinal toxicity ( nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain ) , elevate transaminase approximately 70 % . Ten 12 patient complete therapy . Complete response observe 5 patient partial response observe 5 10 patient . Overall , addition Nelfinavir add minimal additional toxicity . Determination dose biologic activity perform [ 14 ] . In summary , HIV protease inhibitor broad spectrum anti-tumor activity inhibit proliferation and/or cause death majority cancer cell line test dose-dependent manner [ 7 ] . Nelfinavir find potent anti-tumor agent among HIV protease inhibitor . As result , several clinical trial investigate Nelfinavir chemotherapeutic agent without concurrent radiation therapy vary disease site include rectal , head &amp; neck , glioblastoma , pancreas , renal cell , non-small cell lung cancer , liposarcoma , glioma . The NCI also investigate Nelfinavir single agent chemotherapy advance recurrent solid tumor [ 15 ] . As Nelfinavir cytotoxic radiation sensitize effect , ideal agent use combination cisplatin-based chemoradiation locally advance cervical cancer . In study , patient clinical stage IIA , IIB , IIIA , IIIB , IVA cervical carcinoma limit pelvis receive twice daily oral Nelfinavir ( NFV ) weekly IV cisplatin combination radiosensitizers daily whole pelvic external beam ( Mon-Fri ) follow intracavitary radiation brachytherapy .</detailed_description>
