	<brief_summary>Otitis medium common young child estimate 75 % child experience least one episode age three . Otitis medium one common pediatric diagnosis recurrent episode account commonly perform surgical procedure . Despite high degree inaccuracy exist diagnosis condition depend subjective assessment ear drum via direct visualization use otoscope . Researcher use Diffuse optical spectroscopy diffuse optical imaging analysis ear drum middle ear .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research use low energy laser signal light Diffuse optical spectroscopy harmless tissue send ear canal measure tissue optical property include absorption laser signal amount signal backscatter ear drum . These measurement analyze use microprocessor determine presence fluid inflammation eardrum . Diffuse optical spectroscopy image method use near- infrared light measure absolute tissue concentration oxyhemoglobin , deoxyhemoglobin , water , lipid , well subtle change water protein bind state</detailed_description>
