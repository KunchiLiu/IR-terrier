	<detailed_description>Antibiotic consumption antimicrobial resistance remain notoriously high France , particularly among child three year age . In France , pneumococcal conjugate vaccine officially recommend child two 2003 , consequently change occur Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution . Bacterial carriage among child attend day-care centre may result vaccine- antibiotic-driven selective pressure possible repercussion community . To identify prevalence ( rate ) trend antibiotic resistance pattern Streptococcus pneumoniae ( SP ) among child attend day-care centre , well antibiotic prescription vaccine rate , nasopharyngeal ( NP ) carriage monitor , conduct five cross-sectional survey January March 1999 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 2008 among child area Alpes Maritimes , South-Eastern France . Interventions promote prudent antibiotic use ( PAU ) take place 2000 since 2003 , temporary effectiveness national prescription rate report currently increase . A new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine cover serotypes ( 13-valent ) replace previous one . In situation , new cross-sectional survey day-care centre design may answer follow question . - Increasing antibiotic susceptibility observe past successive survey . Has trend sustain day ? - Are antibiotics prescription rate among child attend day-care centre still decrease , stabilize , rise reflect recently report national trend ? - Regarding choice antimicrobial treatment , 3rd generation cephalosporin increasingly prescribe rather aminopenicillins ? - Is implementation new wider spectrum pneumococcal conjugate vaccine exert change serotype distribution thus nasopharyngeal ecosystem child ? These parameter useful renew , even reinforce , adapt professional guideline community-oriented message concern prudent antibiotic use . Sub-study : Antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae , initially observe hospital setting , currently spread within community , especially extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae , threaten antibiotic effectiveness case infection . Such infection Enterobacteriaceae , particular urinary tract infection , occur among child . Prevalence rate carriage among child attend day-care centre unknown , although highly expose antibiotic relation frequent respiratory tract infection , particular 3rd generation cephalosporin . To assess prevalence rate , faecal sample child attend day-care centre collect cross-sectional nasopharyngeal survey quote .</detailed_description>
