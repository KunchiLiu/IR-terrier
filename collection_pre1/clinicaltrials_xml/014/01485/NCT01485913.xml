It conduct one site one country Mali . This site choose meet functional care , access medicine dynamic association diabetic patient . Peer educator person target project recruit local association patient . This association social support provide go prevention counseling , education support service people diabetes . It represent important link patient , educator general medical service . The procedure start train peer educator identify recruited facilitate session Then , 4 educational session : control cardiovascular risk ( blood pressure , waist circumference , smoking , cholesterol , glycaemia ) , control Food ( balance , fat , carbohydrate ) , physical activity management , insulin management , carry patient able : - Analyze knowledge appear various form , include form adapted illiterate patient ( colour code , presence photo ) - Act knowledge : patient observes , make hypothesis , experiment , compare , deduces , analyzes , make relation . - Work interaction learner , give education social dimension . - Decide implementation action take account individual , cultural , social , economic context For situation , day training conduct trained peer educator theoretical contribution issue , practical scenario , analyze issue frame put `` educational security `` .

For outcome measure , propose change HbA1c , increase social emotional support increase linkage clinical care . In addition HbA1c , propose measure change systolic , diastolic blood pressure , weight . Public health significance ( state project apply community potential impact ( ) ) It important find education methodology adapt African context . This line diabetes management essential improve management African diabetic patient . Sustainability plan : If evaluation methodology conclusive , Malian state implement methodology 22 diabetes unit country .</detailed_description>
