	<brief_summary>Lipoprotein lipase deficiency ( LPLD ) autosomal recessive inherited condition cause homozygosity compound heterozygosity mutation within LPL gene . LPLD result subject present fast plasma triglyceride ( TG ) level &gt; 10 mmol/l . LPLD typically present infancy childhood usual complaint severe abdominal pain , repetitive colicky pain repeat episode acute pancreatitis The severe clinical complication associate LPLD acute pancreatitis . Pancreatitis LPLD subject often lead prolonged hospital admission ( sometimes week ) . Subjects survive repeat episode acute pancreatitis may develop chronic pancreatitis , ultimately result endocrine exocrine pancreatic insufficiency . The clinical manifestation acute pancreatitis episode related LPLD largely indistinguishable acute pancreatitis due cause . However , collection data relate hospital admission , laboratory test result , scan image adverse event occur concomitantly acute pancreatic episode allow elimination cause pancreatitis ( e.g gallstone etc ) ultimately allow confirmation LPLD-related acute pancreatitis . Characterization presentation symptom occur around time know episode LPLD-related acute pancreatitis also permit identification episode acute pancreatitis previously consider unrelated even unrecognized . The objective study re-assess re-confirm data previously record incidence severity acute abdominal `` pancreatitis '' episode LPLD subject previously enrol AMT clinical study . To assess document presentation acute abdominal episode occur around know episode pancreatitis permit identification possible new previously unrecorded episode pancreatitis base upon predefined diagnostic criterion . The objective recruit 27 subject previously enrol mentioned clinical study .</brief_summary>

Characterisation presentation symptom occur around time know episode LPLD-related acute pancreatitis also permit identification episode acute pancreatitis previously consider unrelated even unrecognized . Alipogene tiparvovec ( GlyberaÂ® ) development therapy LPLD . In summary , alipogene tiparvovec contain human lipoprotein ( LPL ) gene variant LPLS447X non-replicating vector solution administer one-time series intramuscular injection arms/legs . Studies conduct date Glybera evaluate total triglyceride level surrogate marker efficacy evaluate clinical endpoint acute pancreatitis episodes primary endpoint . Post-hoc analysis suggest may reduction frequency acute abdominal pancreatitis episode report follow treatment compare frequency report pre-treatment past medical history record . The recorded episode use post-hoc analysis collect medical history adverse event data uniform criterion use classify episode acute pancreatitis . Review post hoc analysis raise question record past medical history pancreatitis episode may inaccurate respect diagnosis number episode . In case record review study , data collect pancreatitis episode subject previously enrol study PREPARATION-02 ( observational ) , CT-AMT-011-01 CT-AMT-011-02 . In study CT-AMT-011-01 CT-AMT-011-02 subject receive AMT-011 either dose 3 x 1011 gc/kg 1 x 1012 gc/kg . Data obtain medical record , hospital admission/discharge chart , laboratory result image scan evaluate evidence LPLD-related episode pancreatitis expert review panel . The evaluation consider data collect three time period : - subject entire past medical history , - period enrolment study prior AMT-011 therapy , - period post-administration AMT-011 . Data subject progress receive AMT-011 evaluate control group use data collect past medical history period enrolment PREPARATION-02 .</detailed_description>
