	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : Machine Learning algorithm technique previously develop use robotics field apply field medicine . These state-of-the-art , feature extraction machine learn technique utilize patient vital sign data bedside monitor discover hidden relationship within physiological waveform identify physiological trend concern condition predictive various clinical event . These algorithm could potentially provide preemptive alert clinician develop patient problem , well human could detect worrisome combination event trend data . Specific aim : 1 . Collect physiological waveform numeric trend data patient vital sign monitor ICUs University Colorado Hospital Children 's Hospital Colorado . 2 . Combine physiological data patient monitor clinical data obtain patient Electronic Medical Records include IV fluid , medication , ventilator setting , urine output , etc . use develop model various clinical condition . 3 . Apply Machine Learning technique model identify physiological waveform feature trend information , characteristic predictive common clinical condition include limited : - Post-operative atrial fibrillation cardiac dysrhythmias - Post-operative cardiac tamponade - Tension pneumothorax - Optimal post-operative post-resuscitation fluid need - Intracranial hypertension cerebral perfusion pressure</brief_summary>
