	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy , safety tolerability darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg monotherapy triple combination therapy contain darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( N [ ] RTIs ) approximately 260 Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) infect patient Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy ( HAART ) medication plasma Viral Load 50 copies/mL least 48 week . Also change neurocognitive function compare throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Efficacy Darunavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy Versus Triple Combination Therapy Containing Darunavir/Ritonavir 2 Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Patients With Undetectable Plasma HIV-1 RNA Current Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IIIb , randomise ( study medication assign chance ) , open-label ( patient study physician know treatment group patient assign ) trial compare efficacy , safety tolerability darunavir/ritonavir ( DRV/rtv ) 800/100 mg daily monotherapy triple combination therapy contain DRV/rtv 800/100 mg daily investigator-selected background 2 anti-HIV drug class nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( N [ ] RTIs ) . The investigator-selected N [ ] RTIs dual combination either abacavir ( ABC ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) , zidovudine ( AZT ) , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) . Approximately 260 HIV-1 infected patient , receive HAART least 48 week , change treatment within last 8 week , document evidence plasma viral load ( plasma HIV-1 RNA ) 50 copies/mL least 48 week prior screen , participate study . The study period include screening period maximum 6 week , 4-week run-in period , 96 week treatment period , follow 4 week follow-up period . According original protocol , start 4-week run-in period patient replace 3rd agent ( non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase ( NNRTI ) , protease inhibitor ( PI ) integrase inhibitor ) HAART medication DRV/rtv continue 2 N [ ] RTIs . After 4 week patient randomly assign ( like flip coin ) either monotherapy group triple therapy group . If assign monotherapy group , 2 N [ ] RTIs stop DRV/rtv continue . If assign triple therapy group , DRV/rtv continue together 2 N [ ] RTIs , already take switch new N [ ] RTIs . Based primary efficacy analysis Week 48 , protocol amend subject monotherapy arm enter study nadir CD4+ count &lt; 200 cells/Î¼L also receive 2 N [ ] RTIs ( ie , triple therapy ) soon possible . The main purpose study demonstrate DRV/rtv monotherapy effective triple combination therapy contain DRV/rtv 2N [ ] RTIs . In addition , study look overall safety tolerability two treatment group . During study , patient ' health monitor physical examination , check vital sign ( blood pressure / pulse ) , laboratory test blood urine sample . Also blood sample draw measure antiviral effectiveness ( i.e. , decrease plasma viral load level &lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL ) immunology assessment ( ass body 's immune system ) . A battery neurocognitive function test perform study visit . A sub-study take place select hospital . Approximately 100 patient 2 additional test do , start run-in phase 48-weeks randomisation . For substudy lumbar puncture ( extraction cerebrospinal fluid [ CSF ] spinal canal ) laboratory test ( antiviral effectiveness , pharmacokinetic analysis , biochemistry immune marker ) additional blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis ( measure drug level blood ) take . The study hypothesis , 48 week randomise treatment , DRV/rtv monotherapy effective triple therapy contain DRV/rtv plus 2 N [ ] RTIs . Two 400 mg tablet darunavir one 100 mg tablet ritonavir take together daily orally within 30 minute completion meal , 100 week . The intake investigator-selected N [ ] RTIs accord local prescribing information .</detailed_description>
