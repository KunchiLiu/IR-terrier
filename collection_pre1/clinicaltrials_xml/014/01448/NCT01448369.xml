	<brief_summary>Meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) , extremely common clinical condition ( see half Asian population ) , affect lipid produce meibomian gland eyelid . One function glandular secretion reduce evaporation tear film . In MGD meibomian gland may become blocked various reason . The consequential retention stasis secretion increase immune response well scar response . This eventually result abnormal tear film dry eye symptom . The current standard treatment include warm moist compress , regular lid hygiene , oral antibiotic , topical antibiotic ointment Omega 3 supplementation . Heating extend duration important relief occlusion block meibomian gland . However , improvised method heat cumbersome inefficient require repeat measure , often lead lack compliance . Today , wider range commercially available device help unblock meibomian gland relief dry eye symptom . These device may improve MGD treatment dramatically , test warm climate Singapore , readily available . The current study aim test efficacy treatment device utilize A ) warm moisture ( Blephasteam ) B ) warmth ( EyeGiene ) patient suffer meibomian gland dysfunction . Patients ask use Blephasteam EyeGiene period 4 week . The study monitor patient change tear film lipid composition , well change anatomy meibomian gland . Additionally , dry eye symptom document form questionnaire . If new method manage MGD find efficacious safe , treatment measure make available patient Singapore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Purpose : 1 . A primary purpose study compare efficacy novel eyelid warming device ( Blephasteam EyeGiene ) treatment meibomian gland dysfunction objective clinical score objective assessment ocular surface parameter Asian population . 2 . The second aim ass patient acceptance modality , term comfort convenience . 3 . A third aim study document Meibomian gland disease use non-invasive Meibography , possible alteration condition treatment . Study Design : Prospective , control , single mask , interventional study Rationale : Meibomian gland dysfunction result evaporative dry eye highly common general population . Behavioral factor environmental stress may contribute severity disease . Eyelid warm device potential significantly improve meibomian gland health alleviate dry eye symptom associated disease . Currently eyelid warm device suitable treatment meibomian gland dysfunction available Singapore . Recent technological advance , well infrastructure Singapore Eye Research Institute ( proximity Singapore National Eye Center pre-existing facility infrastructure clinical trial ) facilitate study product available elsewhere may benefit Singaporean population . Methods : Participants target sample size Seventy-five patient dry eye clinic Singapore National Eye Center obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction keen test alternative way treat disease select . Randomisation do randomisation table deem appropriate statistician collaborator . Treatment regime After inform write consent , patient randomly assign group . 1 . Control group , 10-minute treatment , twice daily 2 . Blephasteam , 10-minute treatment , twice daily 3 . EyeGiene , 10-minute treatment , twice daily All patient permit continue regular management MGD use lid scrub lid hygiene preparation ( Lidcare Blephagel ) . For consistency , investigator monitor use measure daily diary prohibit type treatment MGD Omega-3 tablet , antibiotic steroid ointment , probe MG. Visit schedule Screening visit perform regular dry eye clinic . If eligible , patient sign consent undergo baseline examination . Subsequent , follow visit 4 week treatment . A window period +/-3days permit visit . Duration study : Four week .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eyelids must present blocked meibomian gland opening ( plug ) , least 1 visible MG plug 4 eyelid , discernable change consistency meibum MG express upper low eyelid .
