	<brief_summary>The main objective study assess efficacy Avène Compact Honey prevent pigmentation induce visible light subject phototype III IV . Patients expose range visible light area back confirm study eligibility . Patients show pigmentation 7 day expose area eligible continue . Eligible patient study product apply part back . The back expose range light base minimum exposure induce pigmentation previously ascertain . The area study product apply high range light exposure area without study product . Seven day later , area examine determine low exposure induce pigmentation side without study product . The color also measure two identical exposure without apply study product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part A At Day -7 , subject expose range dos visible light approximately 0.90 cm diameter area back ascertain predisposition pigmentation induce visible light . The dos 30 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 120 J cm-2 . At Day 0 visit , subject ' pigmentation determine investigator visual assessment . Subjects low observed pigmentation 30 J cm-2 120 J cm-2 dose continue study . For subject continue , area Avène Compact Honey apply back randomized . At least 15 minute later , unprotected area expose dos range ~1/20th 1.8 time lowest dose visible light induced pigmentation Day -7 . To unnecessarily expose subject , first 3 protected area expose dos range ~half 16 time lowest dose visible light induced pigmentation Day -7 . All subject additional exposure protect side equal high dose unprotected side colorimetric comparison . Subjects examine Day 7 ( seven day visible light exposure ) . Pigmentation expose area evaluate investigator visual assessment . The colorimetric measurement protect unprotected skin record equivalent exposure adjacent skin . The exposed area protect side test colorimetric analysis hidden investigator visual assessment . The minimum dose unprotected side area unprotected unexposed skin hidden colorimetric evaluator maintain blind . The low visible light dose induce pigmentation record unprotected protected area . If first three subject pigment either 16X level protect side , remain subject study expose dos range 0.7 high 24 time lowest dose visible light induced pigmentation Day -7 . Part B At Day 0 , subject expose range dos visible light approximately 0.90 cm diameter area back ascertain disposition pigmentation induce visible light . The dos 8 , 40 , 80 , 160 , 320 480 J cm-2 . At Day 7 visit , subject ' pigmentation determine investigator visual assessment . Subjects divide 2 cohort . Cohort A contain 5 subject phototype IV dark skin cohort B contain 5 subject skin phototype V. Part C At Day -7 , subject expose range dos visible light approximately 0.90 cm diameter area back ascertain predisposition pigmentation induce visible light . The dos 8 , 40 , 80 , 160 , 320 480 J cm-2 . At Day 0 visit , subject ' pigmentation determine investigator visual assessment . Subjects low observed pigmentation 8 J cm-2 dose continue study neither subject show pigmentation 480 J cm-2 . For subject continue , area Avène Compact Honey apply back randomized receive application . At least 15 minute later , protect area expose dos 32 , 160 , 320 , 640 , 1280 1920 cm-2 . Unprotected area expose dos Day 0 . To unnecessarily expose subject , low observed pigmentation Day 0 40 80 J cm-2 maximum exposure Day 0 determine investigator discretion . Subjects examine Day 7 ( seven day visible light exposure ) . Pigmentation expose area evaluate investigator visual assessment . The low visible light dose induce pigmentation record unprotected protected area . The colorimetric measurement protect unprotected skin record equivalent exposure adjacent skin . Four area unprotected protected skin hidden colorimetric evaluator maintain blind . Subjects divide 2 cohort . Cohort A contain 5 subject phototype IV dark skin cohort B contain 5 subject skin phototype V .</detailed_description>
