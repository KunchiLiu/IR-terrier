	<brief_summary>Dry eye ocular surface disease account lot morbidity socio-economic burden Asia rest world . This small pilot study evaluate tear function different condition humidity temperature . This data useful designing future trial ocular surface dry eye . The data likely use propose large national fund project involve clinical trial . This study involve collaboration engineer , ocular surface clinician well specialist defence science organisation . When successfully complete , project increase capability Singapore Eye Research Institute Singapore National Eye Centre support future industry academic research ocular surface .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Adverse Environment : A Pilot Study Evaluate Tear Film Stability Tear Evaporation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Purpose : 1 . A primary purpose study evaluate fluorescein tear break time participant different humidity/ temperature condition . 2 . The second aim ass tear evaporation rate dynamic fashion 20 second ( base non-invasive ocular thermography method ) exposure different humidity/temperature condition . Study Design : Prospective , non-comparative , clinical study Rationale : The ocular surface research team base dry eye service Singapore National Eye Center experience assessment ocular surface patient clinical trial participant . Collaborators DSO National laboratory already experience conduct human study control environment Singapore proven safe pass necessary regulatory approval . In addition , recent technological advance allow collaborator NTU Singapore Polytechnic perform non-invasive tear evaporimetry dynamic way blink . Together , strong research team address important question influence temperature humidity tear film stability . Methods : We intend use 10 volunteer/patients establish whether tear film stability tear film function alter exposure different combination humidity temperature . This involve assessment tear film break time ( TBUT ) tear evaporimetry , non-invasive procedure ( like auto-refractor patient place chin chin rest forehead head rest measurement take ) involve take serial image infra red sensitive video camera . This process perform facility closely monitor proven safe research participant . Participants target sample size : Ten participant recruit . Workflow : We assume approximately 45 minute require chamber achieve require temperature humidity , 15 20 minute participant adjust first environmental setting . Thermography measurement take 1 minute ( 20 sec eye , adjustment camera eye ) . The participant undergo slit lamp examination fluorescein tear break time assessed digital color image break pattern take . These require 5 minute . This mean 3 participant measurement do approximately 20 minute . Measurements 3 participant single condition therefore take 20 minutes.In session last 3 hour 20 minute , investigator complete condition list 3 participant . Since overall session quite long , toilet break permit temperature condition . The investigator estimate 3 session 'dry run ' photography ( without participant ) first session necessary . Visit schedule : Volunteers patient Singapore National Eye Center inform study . Screening perform regular dry eye clinic Singapore National Eye Center . If eligible , volunteer patient sign consent undergo baseline examination . Subsequent , examination perform controlled adverse environment DSO facility . Assessment ocular parameter outline : At Screening visit , investigator perform : - Informed consent - Subject background - Anterior segment finding - Tear film break time At Evaluation visit , investigator perform : - Tear film break time - Photography/Video document tear break - Tear evaporimetry Duration study : Four week .</detailed_description>
