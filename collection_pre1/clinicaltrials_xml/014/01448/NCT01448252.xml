	<brief_title>T Cell Vaccination Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial phase I/II double-blind control clinical trial design evaluate safety clinical efficacy multiple autologous T-cell vaccination ( day 1 , 30 , 90 180 ) progressive MS patient show severe progression/deterioration functional status ( least , one degree EDSS scale ) last year , least one severe relapse . The patient MS clinic randomized ( computer ) two group accord : age , disease duration , disease severity progression rate . One group ( 2/3 patient ) receive active treatment , i.e . TCV , group ( 1/3 patient ) receive sham treatment ( injection sterile normal saline ) . The treat nurse , treat physician , examine neurologist ( one perform neurological evaluation ) patient blind treatment . OBJECTIVES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TRIAL A . To develop new cell therapeutic modality treat MS patient use attenuated autologous anti-MBP , anti-PLP anti-MOG autoreactive T-cells vaccine . The immune response induce vaccination direct specifically T-cells attack patient 's nerve system ( specifically myelin sheath ) . B . To study characterize autoreactive T-cells MS patient . The number function cell course relapse disease , well period remission , study . C. To study clinical efficacy T-cell vaccination attenuate anti-MBP anti-MOG autologous T-cells MS . The parameter examine include : change disability status ( EDSS disability scale , well ambulation index several functional test ) , change relapse rate time 10-meters walk test , PASAT test 9-hole peg test . MRI parameter represent additional endpoint include : change total burden disease quantity irreversible damage ( cortical atrophy axonal loss ) . In addition , effect treatment immune response ( i.e . number proportion activate lymphocyte , number proportion anti-myelin reactive lymphocyte peripheral blood IgG antibody level cerebrospinal fluid ) evaluate treated MS patient . The significance importance study outline follow : 1 . It offer new approach treatment MS. 2 . This approach advantage devoid toxic general immunosuppressive effect . 3 . The study pave way study improve understand mechanism host immune response MS involvement MBP , PLP MOG myelin proteins initiation auto-reactive immune response clinical MS .</detailed_description>
