	<brief_summary>Patients difficulty swallow ( dysphagia ) reflux disease frequently find suffer oesophageal hypomotility ( weak contraction ) . Oesophageal motility currently measure use high-resolution manometry ( HRM ) . This technique 36 pressure sensor plastic tube record pressure side oesophagus . Several pharmaceutical agent ( prokinetics ) stimulate oesophageal motility . However , use prokinetics patient oesophageal hypomotility lead disappointing result . An explanation disappointing result inappropriate patient target . The appropriate patient would one still viable muscle oesophagus respond pharmacological stimulus . In process develop treatment strategy patient oesophageal hypomotility , test preserve capacity oesophageal muscle could useful predict response patient prokinetic drug . The following test potential reveal preserve capacity oesophageal muscle respond stronger/medicinal stimulus . 1 . - Multiple rapid swallowing ( MRS ) 5ml water bolus stimulate oesophagus . A normal response MRS require one hand integrity neural mechanism hand functional oesophageal muscle . 2 . - External abdominal compression increase resistance bolus transport via oesophagus . The normal oesophagus produce contraction higher amplitude duration order maintain normal bolus transit . 3 . - Swallowing bread bolus require strong oesophageal contraction successful bolus transit . The purpose propose project firstly assess effect Azithromycin oesophageal hypomotility secondly evaluate predictive value stimulation technique predict likelihood positive response drug therapy .</brief_summary>
