	<detailed_description>Minor head injury common present complaint pediatric emergency department . Skull x-rays useful tool evaluation paediatric patient history minor head trauma . However , exist ongoing controversy regard ideal number view obtain skull series . This study aim determine significant difference diagnostic accuracy skull x-rays diagnosis fracture paediatric minor head trauma patient 2-film series oppose 4-film series provide participate pediatric emergency physician . This prospective , crossover experimental study evaluate equivalency sensitivity specificity 2-film series versus 4-film series diagnosis skull fracture associate minor head injury child . The study involve 10 pediatric emergency physician evaluate two module 100 series radiography . In order , give two work module . Each module contain randomize anonymous x-ray 50 case 50 control mount power point slide . Among 50 case , evaluation sequence randomize 25 case evaluate 2-film series first module 4-film series second module 25 case evaluate reverse order . The procedure use randomize evaluation sequence 50 control . The primary outcome overall sensitivity specificity pediatric emergency medicine physician detection skull fracture use two evaluation method : one present skull series 2 view another presented standard 4-view series .</detailed_description>
