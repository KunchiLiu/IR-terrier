	<brief_title>Study Patients With Primary Breast Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) rare presentation non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . A significant risk contralateral breast involvement tendency central nervous system ( CNS ) progression identify previous study . Optimal treatment strategy primary breast DLBCL remain undefined , although combination anthracycline-based chemotherapy radiotherapy may consider best treatment option study . However , despite administration aggressive treatment , prognosis still poor , even localized disease , 5-year progression-free survival rate approximately 50 % 65 % series . Therefore , therapeutic option must explore . During last decade , several study show rituximab plus CHOP CHOP-like chemotherapy significantly improve clinical outcome patient DLBCL . However , relevance rituximab management rare extranodal lymphoma never study . Moreover , several study also suggest possibility prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy might effective reduce CNS recurrence . Thus , trial design prospectively evaluate treatment strategy , address safety efficacy combine therapy include R-CHOP21 prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy use methotrexate .</detailed_description>
