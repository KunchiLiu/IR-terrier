	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether adult patient admit Intensive Care Unit septic shock give hydrocortisone compare placebo ( dummy solution ) , improved rate survival 90 day later . Septic shock result infection , trigger complex response body ( inflammatory response ) cause decrease blood pressure subsequently one organ system fail blood supply organ reduce . This may result poor recovery death . About quarter people suffer septic shock rapidly reverse , die . When patient admit Intensive Care sepsis and/or septic shock receive number therapy . These include fluid give drip , antibiotic , drug boost blood pressure organ system . In addition therapy , steroid ( hydrocortisone ) sometimes administer . Whether steroids useful treatment severe infection study 50 year . Previous research suggest use low dose steroid may shortterm benefit improve circulation . However , agreement amongst doctor around world whether treatment without low dose steroid improve overall recovery survival patient septic shock . This study would allow doctor make informed decision whether addition low dose steroid therapy well patient septic shock intensive care . The study include 3800 intensive care patient septic shock . Each enrol patient randomise receive either Hydrocortisone 200mg placebo daily 7 day continuous intravenous infusion intensive care . The patient follow 90 day . If patient discharge prior 90 day telephone call make followup information . At six month patient contact completion quality life questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To evaluate impact intravenous hydrocortisone versus placebo cause mortality 90 day critically ill patient septic shock . The hypothesis hydrocortisone , compare placebo , reduce 90-day all-cause mortality patient admit ICU septic shock . 'Shock ' define need vasopressor inotropes maintain systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 millimetre mercury ( mmHg ) , mean arterial blood pressure &gt; 60mmHg mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) target set treat clinician maintain perfusion . 'Septic shock ' shock secondary sepsis Secondary Objectives To assess impact intravenous hydrocortisone versus placebo recovery , complication , septic shock development treatment related adverse reaction . Study Design This study multi centre , randomise , blind , placebo control trial compare intravenous hydrocortisone placebo critically ill patient septic shock . Randomisation achieve via secure interactive web base system use permuted block minimisation . Randomisation stratify participate site operative non-operative admission ICU . The primary endpoint trial death cause 90 day . Pre define sub group include follow category : - Operative ( admit ICU operate theatre recovery room ) versus non-operative admission . - Dose adrenaline noradrenaline randomisation - ≤ 15 mcg / minute versus &gt; 15 mcg / minute . 3,800 patient enrol study approximately 50 - 60 study site . Eligible patient randomise receive either intravenous hydrocortisone 200mg placebo per day 7 day . For patient , data collect baseline daily whilst patient ICU . Patients follow day 14 , regardless patient resides hospital , monitor development bacteraemia . Additional follow occur 90 day 6 month post randomisation .</detailed_description>
