	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Canadians ( Canadian Cancer Society , cigarette smoking responsible 85 % case . Smoking topography , key facet smoke behaviour , subjectively objectively measure quantify puff volume , maximum puff velocity , interpuff interval , puff duration , number puff per cigarette , time smoke single cigarette . Smoking topography estimate exposure carcinogenic toxin present cigarette smoking ( Djordjevic , Hoffman , &amp; Hoffman , 1997 ) . Evidence exist support exercise modifies smoke topography ( Katomeri &amp; Taylor 2006 ; Mikhail , 1983 ; Reeser , 1983 ; Zacny &amp; Stitzer , 1985 ) . Recently , Faulkner colleague ( 2011 ; N = 18 ) first implement handheld smoking topography device ( CReSS Pocket ) measure smoke behaviour context acute bout exercise temporary period abstinence . They find brisk walking influence individual 's smoking topography . In specific , participant assign exercise condition smoke less per puff take short puff duration , compare passive sit condition . Overall , smoke topographical study require investigation due methodological flaw order allow objective collection smoke behaviour data improve external validity sufficiently power study . Furthermore , role craving , withdrawal affect potential mediator topographical change due exercise novel area research .</detailed_description>
