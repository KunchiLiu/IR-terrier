	<brief_title>AT9283 Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify maximum-tolerated dose recommend phase IIb dose multikinase inhibitor AT9283 pediatric patient relapse refractory acute leukemia . Secondary - To evaluate safety tolerability drug patient . - To document evidence efficacy drug patient . - To investigate pharmacokinetic profile drug plasma patient . Tertiary - To assess target kinase inhibition multikinase inhibitor AT9283 patient . - To identify potential predictive molecular biomarkers patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive multikinase inhibitor AT9283 IV continuously 72 hour . Treatment repeat every 21 days* 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve benefit treatment may continue 6 course discretion chief/principal investigator . NOTE : *Course length may extend maximum 42 day allow recovery blood count . Intrathecal therapy permit course 2 onwards patient ALL . Blood specimen collect pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study include molecular predictive biomarkers ex vivo vivo measurement kinase inhibition assessment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 42 day recovery blood count ( whichever sooner ) . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
