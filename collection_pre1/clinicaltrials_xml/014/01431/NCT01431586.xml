	<brief_summary>This first study conduct human JDTic , new chemical entity , evaluation focus safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) JDTic follow administration single oral dos . JDTic novel , selective κ opioid receptor antagonist currently develop RTI International potential pharmacotherapy treat cocaine dependence . This study possibility identify maximum tolerate dose human surrogate measure JDTic pharmacodynamic ( PD ) activity . Data study use plan define dose range subsequent study , well identify potential indicator JDTic pharmacological activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>JDTic-001 single-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose study evaluate three plan escalate oral dos JDTic three plan cohort healthy male subject without history illicit drug use within 12 month precede Screening Visit , substance abuse within 12 month precede Screening Visit . Each cohort 8 eligible subject enrol sequentially receive single oral dose study drug fast condition . JDTic dose escalation occur safety PK data permit . A semi adaptive dosing plan follow first two dose cohort comprise 4 subject third plan cohort comprise 8 subject . If adverse event ( AEs ) consider least possibly relate study medication Clinic Principal Investigator note study subject participate first two cohort , additional 4 subject dose dose level part affect cohort , unless otherwise determine Safety Review Team ( SRT ) guide JDTic-001 Data Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSMP ) . Should dose additional subject occur first cohort subject , second cohort subject also include 8 subject . In cohort , subject randomized 3:1 active drug : placebo double-blind fashion . The plan JDTic dose level evaluate 1 mg , 3 mg , 10 mg ; however , actual dose level evaluate may different , and/or additional dose level may add protocol amendment , depend safety PK result low dos . Subjects admit clinic day dose confine clinic 6 night , safety PK evaluations assessment last approximately 125 hour follow administration study drug . Subjects require remain confined clinic 6 night experience persistent AEs require observation and/or Clinic Principal Investigator qualify designee ( physician list subinvestigator FDA Form 1572 ) considers unsafe release subject clinic . Additionally , alternate subject admit Group 1 dose may remain clinic overnight possibility dose Group 2 therefore would spend 6 night clinic . Subjects return clinic 14 day receive dose follow-up visit . If , visit , change POMS™ assessment note consider significant Clinic Principal Investigator 's opinion , subject ongoing AE , subject return clinic every 14 day ( sooner , clinically indicate ) date follow-up visit changes/AEs resolve . Subject participation study last 4 week , screen follow-up visit , depend date subject 's screening visit begin respect date dose , provide additional follow-up visit necessary .</detailed_description>
