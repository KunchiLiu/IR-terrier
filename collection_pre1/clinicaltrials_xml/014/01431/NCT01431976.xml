	<brief_summary>This multi-center , uncontrolled , open-label study evaluate efficacy safety lamotrigine monotherapy newly diagnose typical absence seizure child adolescents Japan South Korea . The study period compose baseline , fix escalation phase , escalation phase , maintenance phase , taper phase , post study examination . During fixed escalation phase , investigational product administer 0.3 mg/kg/day 2 week ( Week 1 2 ) , follow 0.6 mg/kg/day 2 week ( Week 3 4 ) . Subjects thereafter visit clinic every 1 2 week escalation phase increase dose 0.6 mg/kg/day maximum 10.2 mg/kg/day 400 mg/day ( whichever less ) patient confirm seizure-free HV test clinical sign . After seizure free confirm HV-clinical sign , dose increase one level HV-EEG ( electroencephalography ) test ( first test ) assess next visit . If seizure free observe HV-EEG , dose administer . Thereafter , HV-EEG ( second test ) assess next visit seizure free confirm , subject enter 12-week maintenance phase . During maintenance phase , patient visit clinic every 4 week . The dose adjust necessary within range 1.2 10.2 mg/kg/day 400 mg/day ( whichever less ) take account status seizures safety . The investigational product administer daily ( even ) . However , number tablet large , twice-daily administration ( morning evening ) also allow . After completion maintenance phase , subject respond lamotrigine without tolerability issue eligible enter extension phase study clinically indicate .</brief_summary>
