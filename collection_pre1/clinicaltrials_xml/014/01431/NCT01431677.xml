	<brief_summary>Background : - In individual age , change muscle tissue significantly affect muscle strength exercise endurance . This process , know sarcopenia , may lead decreased mobility physical weakness , general refer frailty . The cause sarcopenia affect individual others know , many factor influence muscle physiology function , include metabolic , hormonal , environmental , lifestyle factor . Researchers interested identifying factor involve start progression sarcopenia need sample human muscle tissue cell laboratory investigation . Objectives : - To train researcher appropriate procedure perform muscle biopsy collect , label , store sample . - Develop data base specific scientific study evaluate physiological metabolic function muscle use future study . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test , schedule date muscle biopsy . - Participants muscle biopsy , tissue cell take upper part thigh . A local anesthetic give procedure . Participants also provide blood sample electrocardiogram evaluate heart function . - Participants followup visit 1 week biopsy visit evaluate heal process provide treatment affected area , may fully resume normal activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An important concept pathologic age individual muscle strength exercise endurance significantly decrease quantitative qualitative change muscle tissue . This process , term sarcopenia , lead frailty , syndrome characterize decreased mobility , weakness , poor prognosis survival , although causal pathway association know . The cause sarcopenia affect individual others know . This complicate scientific question many factor influence muscle physiology function , include metabolic , hormonal , environmental , life-style , co-morbid medical problem treatment , etc . The National Institute Aging ( NIA ) long-standing interest sarcopenia frailty establish number observational study aim understanding cause course age-related condition . It goal try identify factor involve initiation progression sarcopenia frailty , develop therapy reverse slow process . To identify molecular genetic change associate sarcopenia , crucial human muscle biopsy specimens available laboratory investigation . This proposal enable Clinical Research Branch ( CRB ) set procedure NIA Clinical Research Unit locate fifth floor Harbor Hospital , hone practical skill need analyze muscle tissue individual observational interventional clinical trial . The goal become facile perform muscle biopsy , collect , label store sample , ensure equipment expertise require efficiently perform procedure place . 14 healthy volunteer accrue study , however , protocol keep open purpose training physician nurse practitioner biopsy procedure .</detailed_description>
