	<brief_title>Melatonin Versus Placebo Benzodiazepine Discontinuation Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment schizophrenia frequently include prolonged administration benzodiazepine despite lack evidence use . It often difficult discontinue use benzodiazepine development dependence . After randomized prolonged-release melatonin ( CircadinÂ® ) 2 mg daily versus match placebo , participant require slowly taper benzodiazepine dose towards intake . Data collect baseline 6 month follow-up regard medical treatment , cognition , psychophysiology , sleep , laboratory test , adverse event , psychopathology , social function , quality life . Data medical treatment , cognition , adverse event , social function , quality life also collect 2 4 month follow-up . The result trial assess melatonin role withdraw long-term benzodiazepine administration schizophrenia patient . This group patient difficult treat therefore often subject polypharmacy may play role reduced life expectancy compare background population . In addition , data trial also analyze observational cohort design investigate association benzodiazepine dose reduction/discontinuation psychophysiology , cognition , sleep , quality life , select variable ( describe , see trial protocol ) . Knowledge important clinical aspect lack group patient .</detailed_description>
