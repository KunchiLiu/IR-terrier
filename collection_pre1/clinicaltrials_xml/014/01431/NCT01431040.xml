	<brief_summary>Preoperative bowel preparation surgical management pelvic floor disorder perform inconsistently , include prep , use dietary change bowel alter intervention . Retrospective study emergency colonic surgery first demonstrate low rate infectious complication without bowel prep . Recently , data support routine use mechanical cleanse elective colorectal surgery demonstrate surgical outcome similar patient undergo bowel preparation versus , indicate long held dogma mechanical bowel preparation use selectively . Despite routine use , paucity literature address approach , and/or need preoperative bowel management time vaginal reconstructive obliterative surgery . The majority pelvic floor disorder population old , tend bowel dysfunction ( especially symptoms constipation ) young woman . The aim study evaluate preoperative bowel management strategy relate total care vaginal surgery patient ' intra-and post-operative bowel function overall patient experience . Two commonly use pre-operative bowel prep strategy : preoperative bowel prep versus clear fluid 2-enema prep .

In pilot study , subject randomize either clear liquid diet day prior surgery 2 enema nothing mouth ( NPO ) midnight , NPO midnight without dietary change enemas . Our aim : *Primary - To assess surgeon ' objective intraoperative evaluation effect bowel preparation ( adequate visualization , stool case , difficulty bowel handle ) *Secondary - ( 1 ) To characterize patient ' experience acceptance preoperative bowel management regimen versus preoperative bowel preparation ( 2 ) To characterize patient ' postoperative experience determine preoperative bowel regimen affect time first bowel movement/first normal stool well stool experience record bowel diary ( 3 ) Evaluate incidence complication two group ( 4 ) Characterize descriptive quality patient ' operative experience ( duration case , length hospital stay )</brief_summary>
