	<brief_summary>A lot shoulder function evaluation score exist none universally accept gold standard . Recent study demonstrate potential computerized movement analysis embed sensor objective evaluation shoulder functional outcome follow surgery . A simple testing procedure possible repetition two simple shoulder movement sufficient . This could potentially facilitate implementation shoulder function movement analysis current clinical practice . However , present stage development , method need extensively validate . This mean research intend determine precisely current shoulder pathology apply , outcome healthy people , reliability score monitor patient evolution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Kinematic Functional Shoulder Score Including Only Essential Movements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurement shoulder function controversial issue . There great variety measurement tool none universally accept . There therefore need develop extensively validated convenient measurement tool . Embedded computerized movement analysis potentially meet requirement measurement shoulder function . Ambulatory measurement device allow application various clinical condition , display adequate precision accuracy , considerably straightforward laboratory-based system . Using Physilog Â® II embed system , Coley ( 2007 ) develop relatively simple score shoulder function ( P Score ) . The method base arm power measurement three-dimensional accelerometer gyroscope seven consecutive shoulder movement . It demonstrate reliability , responsiveness criterion-based validity . However , additional knowledge technological progress could contribute simplification test procedure . Indeed , secondary analysis Coley 's study data base principal component analysis multiple regression highlight procedure include two selected movement produce comparable result P Score . Moreover , development wireless system considerably simplifies set . Consequently , simpler equivalent measurement procedure consider . A pilot study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01281085 ) conduct prepare study . contribute determine number replication movement need refine test procedure . The aim study proceed extensive validation study simplify testing procedure . Kinematic measurement carry four group patient present frequent shoulder condition ( rotator cuff condition , shoulder instability , diaphyseal subcapital humerus fracture , frozen shoulder ) group healthy people . Measurement procedure include two consecutive measurement , alternatively conduct two evaluator measure simultaneously two different movement analysis system . Currently use functional questionnaire complete stage comparison . Measurement perform baseline 6 month later . Statistical analysis address reproducibility , responsiveness , minimal clinically important difference correlation current clinical score .</detailed_description>
