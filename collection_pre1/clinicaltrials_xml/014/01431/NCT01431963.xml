	<brief_summary>This multi-center , uncontrolled , open-label study conduct Japan South Korea evaluate efficacy safety lamotrigine monotherapy subject newly diagnose epilepsy recurrent epilepsy ( currently untreated ) . The study compose baseline , escalation phase , maintenance phase , taper phase post study examination . During escalation phase , investigational product administer orally 25 mg/day 2 week , 50 mg/day 2 week finally 100 mg/day 2 week . During maintenance phase , 200 mg/day administer orally 24 week . However , dose decrease 100 mg/day safety concern . Also , confirm seizure control dose 200 mg/day , dose gradually increased 400 mg/day 50-100 mg/day interval least 1 week . As rule , lamotrigine administer daily ( even ) , dose exceed 200 mg/day administer two divided dos ( morning evening ) . After completion maintenance phase , Japanese subject respond lamotrigine without tolerability issue eligible enter extension phase study indicate , either approval indication ( monotherapy epilepsy ) 24 month LSLV ( Last Subject 's Last Visit ) maintenance phase , whichever sooner .</brief_summary>
