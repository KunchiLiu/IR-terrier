	<brief_summary>The timing initiate short-term treatment COPD exacerbations oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic therapy show influence recovery time exacerbation early initiation exacerbation therapy faster symptom recovery compare delayed initiation . While oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic therapy crucial immediate exacerbation therapy , maintenance therapy controller medication COPD recommend reduce risk future exacerbation . The initiation maintenance therapy COPD exacerbation show beneficial reduction risk future exacerbation . However , lack information whether time initiation influence risk future exacerbation . The follow study evaluate impact early versus delay initiation controller medication therapy maintenance treatment follow COPD-related exacerbation outcomes future exacerbation cost patient COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Associated With Early Delayed Maintenance Treatment Post-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study period analysis range January 2003 June 2009 . Patients least one COPD exacerbation select initial population . Three type COPD exacerbation identify : 1 ) hospitalization primary discharge diagnosis code COPD , 2 ) emergency department ( ED ) visit primary diagnosis code COPD , 3 ) physician visit dispense oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) antibiotic ( ABX ) within 5 day visit . Only first two select index exacerbation , define first chronologically occur exacerbation patient . For hospitalization exacerbation discharge date hospitalization index date ED exacerbation date visit index date . The pre-index period define 1-year period index date post-index period define 1-year period index date . The enrollment period thus range January 1 , 2004 June 30 , 2008 . The post-index period use identify date receipt prescription first COPD maintenance medication . This date receipt use compute time start maintenance treatment . Maintenance treatment refers use controller medication . Specifically study hypothesis primary outcome test : Ho : There difference risk COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit early delay cohort Ha : There difference risk COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit early delay cohort Hypothesis key secondary outcome COPD-related cost test : Ho : There difference COPD-related cost early delay cohort Ha : There difference COPD-related cost early delay cohort</detailed_description>
