	<detailed_description>Screening Visit : Initial screen evaluation include physical examination , medical history , clinical laboratory assessment conduct determine study eligibility routine clinic visit UPMC HVI , CLC inpatient UPMC Presbyterian . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . Day 1 : This study visit occur day subject schedule clinically indicate right heart catheterization volunteer research right heart catheterization specific study . Subjects oral background PAH therapy ( ETRA PDE5I ) instruct hold regimen day study visit . Subjects receive nebulized AIR001 dos escalate base upon safety tolerability . The dose inhale nitrite deliver via electronic nebulizer . During study right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics measure well noninvasive systemic blood pressure monitoring . Subjects test change pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) use standard clinical protocol hemodynamic recording right atrial , right ventricular , pulmonary artery pressure , addition cardiac output time zero , 3 Day phone follow 30 Day follow visit : All subject enrol study follow 30 day ( +/- 5 day window ) completion study treatment . A physical exam clinical lab obtain visit .</detailed_description>
