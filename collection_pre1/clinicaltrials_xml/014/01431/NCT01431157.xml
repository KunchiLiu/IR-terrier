	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea syndrome clinically define frequent pause breathe sleep symptom , tire . It decrease restfulness sleep decrease level oxygen blood . Sleep apnea patient suffer daytime sleepiness , hypertension , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , stroke , ischemic heart disease , arrhythmia , pulmonary hypertension , heart failure , premature death . There significant evidence suggest nighttime decrease blood oxygen level primary cause many abnormality associate disease . Epidemiological study demonstrate surprisingly high prevalence sleep apnea . Mild sleep apnea present 17 % adult general population moderate severe sleep apnea present 5.7 % adult . Among patient heart failure prevalence skyrocket . Multiple study find prevalence moderate severe sleep apnea anywhere 11-53 % heart failure patient . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy currently standard care sleep apnea sufferer regardless severity disease . In patient without heart failure , CPAP therapy numerous benefit several long term study report CPAP cause less cardiovascular disease well long term improvement cardiovascular symptom mortality among patient severe sleep apnea . In heart failure patient , CPAP show beneficial short term effect evidence long term improvement symptoms mortality lacking . Compliance CPAP therapy reduce systolic blood pressure , improve cardiac function , raise oxygen level , increase exercise tolerance . On hand , CPAP show affect survival number hospitalization heart failure patient . Moreover , compliance CPAP often poor many people tolerate . This limit therapeutic effectiveness intervention . The purpose study ass whether nocturnal oxygen administration via nasal cannula alone improve outcome congestive heart failure patient moderate severe sleep apnea . The effect nocturnal oxygen administration assess use biomarkers heart stress marker whole body inflammation .</brief_summary>
