	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Phosphate ( Oral JAK Inhibitor INCB18424 ) Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess overall response rate ( ORR ) subject relapse diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) relapse refractory front-line treatment ineligible stem cell transplantation recurrent disease stem cell transplantation oral ruxolitinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety oral ruxolitinib subject DLBCL PTCL . II . Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) , duration response , overall response ( OS ) subject DLBCL PTCL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore relationship response oral ruxolitinib alteration gene expression profile ( GEP ) signatures well biomarker immunophenotypic change relate JAK2/STAT3 , NF-ÎºB , BCR , PI3K/AKT , mTOR pathway . II . Evaluate potential effect oral ruxolitinib exposure JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition serial tumor sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate ( oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424 ) orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
