	<brief_title>Effect Steroid Postoperative Swelling After Orthognathic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative swell annoy problem orthognathic surgery . There two reason minimize postoperative swelling . The first functional consideration . Orthognathic surgery perform oromaxillary area , consequently swell area compromise airway . The second esthetic one , patient feel uncomfortable embarrass swollen face . Reducing facial swell orthognathic surgery help reduce airway complication patient time . Several method use reduce postoperative facial swelling , include control hypotension operation , meticulous operative procedure , postoperative facial ice packing , head elevation , suction drainage . Perioperative use steroid apply reduction facial swell oral surgery 3rd molar extraction . Cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX1 ) COX2 report important enzyme inflammatory process , steroid inhibit synthesis , consequently reduce postoperative edema . Steroid also use decrease edema orthognathic surgery , well reduce pain , nausea vomiting . There three randomize control study look effect steroid postoperative facial swell orthognathic surgery , separately Dr. Weber et al , Peillon et al , Munro et al . However , result controversial . The first two study conclude steroid use could reduce facial swelling . The one find significant difference experimental control group . Another limitation previous study use two-dimensional non-objective method evaluation amount swelling , could less accurate . Three-dimensional photogrammetry introduce recent year , obtain satisfactory result conventional method . The investigator experience apply device facial surface study , accuracy validate image laboratory . The purpose study determine effect steroid reduction postoperative facial swell determined three-dimensional photographic method . 3dMD face scanner use . The 3-dimensional method make harm patient . Patients seat scan thus reduce possible inconvenience . There radiation hazard method . The image acquisition time 2 millisecond less , therefore concern motion artifact . The first part study get information swell curve orthognathic surgery . 3dMD face scan perform 5 time postoperatively every 12 hour 24 hour operation . When postoperative timing maximal facial swelling obtain , investigator proceed perform second part study , number facial scanning reduce . The second part study involve recruit 70 patient prognathism . The patient carefully screen select craniofacial surgeon . The patient take preoperative postoperative 3dMD image scanning . The recovery course clinical outcome monitor . 3dMD face image data analysis perform quantitative comparison experimental control group .</detailed_description>
