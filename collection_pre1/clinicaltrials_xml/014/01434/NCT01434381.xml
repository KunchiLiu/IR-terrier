	<brief_summary>Background : - The malaria vaccine Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel may help block malaria parasites develop mosquito . When mosquito bite vaccinate person , vaccine prevent parasites develop mosquito . As result , mosquito spread malaria next person bite . However , vaccine directly prevent people get sick malaria . Researchers want test safety response vaccine . Objectives : - To test safety malaria vaccine Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - They assign study group either two three dos vaccine . Participants checkups dose vaccine , - The additional dos give 2 month 2 4 month first vaccine . - Participants regular blood test check level response vaccine . - They follow 1 year last vaccine additional test need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Study Malaria Vaccine Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel ( Registered Trademark )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vaccine interrupt malaria transmission would valuable tool local elimination eradication disease . Pfs25 , surface antigen ookinetes mosquito stage P. falciparum , lead candidate malaria transmission block vaccine . Recombinant Pfs25 conjugate Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A ( EPA ) , adjuvanted Alhydrogel ( Registered Trademark ) . This open label , dose escalate Phase 1 study malaria naive adult , conduct Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health Center Immunization Research ( CIR ) Baltimore , Maryland , determine initial safety immunogenicity vaccine give 2-dose,3-dose , 4-dose schedule . Thirty ( 30 ) volunteer enrol , 5 receive low dose ( 8 micro g conjugate Pfs25 ) , 5 receive middle dose ( 16 micro g conjugate Pfs25 ) , 20 receive high dose ( 47 micro g conjugate Pfs25 ) . The high dose group receive either 2 , 3 4 dos vaccine , 0 , 2 , 4 10 month vaccination schedule . Volunteers follow 12 month follow last vaccination . Safety outcomes local systemic adverse event ( AEs ) . Immunogenicity outcomes antibody response measure ELISA , transmission block standard membrane feed assay , B T cell response .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A volunteer exclude participate trial one follow criterion fulfil : Pregnancy determine positive urine serum human choriogonadotropin ( BetahCG ) test point study ( female ) . Currently lactate breastfeed ( female ) . Behavioral , cognitive , psychiatric disease opinion investigator affect ability participant understand cooperate study protocol . Neutropenia define absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500/mm ( 3 ) . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) level laboratorydefined upper limit normal . Evidence clinically significant neurologic , cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , endocrine , rheumatologic , autoimmune , hematological , renal disease history , physical examination , and/or laboratory study include urinalysis . Other condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety right participant participate trial would render subject unable comply protocol . History receive investigational product within past 30 day . Receipt antimalarial prophylaxis past 12 month , plan travel destination would require malaria prophylaxis period participation . Prior malaria infection history . Participant medical , occupational , family problem result alcohol illicit drug use past 12 month . History severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis . Severe asthma . This define : Asthma unstable require emergent care , urgent care , hospitalization intubation past 2 year , require use oral parenteral corticosteroid . Clinically significant reactive airway disease respond bronchodilator . Positive ELISA confirmatory Western blot test HIV1 . Positive ELISA confirmatory test hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ELISA . Preexisting autoimmune antibodymediated disease include limited : systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , Sjogren 's syndrome , autoimmune thrombocytopenia . Known immunodeficiency syndrome . Use chronic ( great equal 14 day ) oral intravenous corticosteroid ( exclude topical nasal ) immunosuppressive dos ( i.e . prednisone &gt; 10 mg/ day ) immunosuppressive drug within 30 day start study . Receipt live vaccine within past 4 week kill vaccine within past 2 week prior entry study . History surgical splenectomy . Receipt blood product within past 6 month . Previous receipt investigational malaria vaccine . Refusal allow storage sample future research . Any medical , psychiatric , social , occupational condition responsibility , judgment Principal Investigator ( PI ) , would interfere evaluation study objective .</criteria>
