	<brief_title>Feasibility Delivering Quitline Based Smoking Cessation Intervention Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * To assess feasibility deliver Quitline base smoking cessation intervention cancer patient outpatient set . To achieve , deliver intervention cancer patient surgery , radiation medical oncology department participate Community Clinical Oncology Program ( CCOP ) sit . Following intervention , ass participant , CRA ( Clinical Research Associate ) Counselor Quitline staff rating acceptability , resource require deliver intervention , protocol fidelity , participant recruitment , retention adherence . Secondary - To obtain preliminary estimate quit rate ( define 7-day point-prevalence abstinence ) intervention control group . To accomplish aim , follow intervention collect confirm smoke status data intervention control subject . We also obtain preliminary estimate treatment effect ( difference quit rate two group ) standard deviation well determine sample size future trial . - To evaluate primary patient report outcome , include quality life ( quantified FACT-G lung cancer patient FACT-L concern question EORTC QLQ LC13 ) , perceive life stress ( quantify Perceived Stress Scale ) , depression ( quantified CESD-10 ) , cancer patient intervention control group . - To refine recruitment intervention protocol use data collect participant , Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ) Counselor , Quitline staff increase acceptability improve retention future trial . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants stratify accord time since diagnosis ( &lt; 3 month vs ≥ 3 month ) , treatment status ( ongoing vs complete ) , cigarette smoking ( ≤ 10 per day v ≥ 11 per day ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I ( intervention ) : Participants receive letter physician advise quit smoking , undergo 15-30-minute smoking-cessation counseling session train research staff . During counsel session , participant educate motivated importance quit smoking , cancer-specific quit issue manage stressor associate cancer diagnosis treatment . They also tell expect call Quitline 2-3 day receive fact sheet benefit smoke cessation cancer patient . Participants receive 8 week nicotine replacement patch 5 proactive telephone call 12-week period . Calls schedule convenient time participant relapse-sensitive interval include ; initial planning assessment call , quit date call , follow-up call 7 day participant 's quit date , 2 additional call 2-3-week interval . Participants also encourage utilize Quit Life Web Coach , interactive web program application guide build online quit plan , set quit date , track progress toward quit . Participants also learn behavioral tip cop skill interact others topic-based discussion forum community support program . - Arm II ( standard care ) : Participants receive letter physician advise quit smoking , importance quit smoke cancer patient , copy National Cancer Institute 's `` Clearing Air '' smoke cessation booklet . Participants also receive standard care oncology treatment provider may may include nicotine replacement therapy . Participants intervention arm complete Smoking Assessment , Smoking Cessation Self-Efficacy , Brief Smoking Consequences , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer ( FACT-L ) , European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire LC-13 , Perceived Stress Scale , Center Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale ( CESD-10 Depression ) , Follow Smoking Assessment questionnaires baseline 6 , 12 , 24 week . Participants , intervention arm , undergo saliva sample collection baseline 12 24 week cotinine level analysis .</detailed_description>

Due unknown risk potential harm unborn fetus , sexually active woman childbearing potential must use reliable method birth control participate study . Reliable method birth control : abstinence ( sex ) , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , DepoProvera , tubal ligation , vasectomy partner ( confirm negative sperm count ) monogamous relationship ( partner ) . An acceptable , although less reliable , method involves careful use condom spermicidal foam gel and/or cervical cap sponge . We encourage discuss issue doctor question . 11 . If pregnant , become pregnant suspect pregnant prior participate study , inform study physician immediately . Nicotine replacement therapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect classify FDA Pregnancy category D drug . The U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline state pregnant smoker encourage quit without medication base insufficient evidence effectiveness hypothetical concern safety . Pregnant woman enrol study randomized Quitline group intervention participate Quitline intervention receive nicotine replacement therapy . 12 . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother nicotine replacement therapy , breastfeed woman exclude study .</criteria>
