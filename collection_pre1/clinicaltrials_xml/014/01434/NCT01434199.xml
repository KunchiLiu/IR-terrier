	<brief_summary>As incidence colorectal cancer ( CRC ) rapidly rise Asian country , screen colonoscopy perform prevention early detection fatal disease . Complete colonoscopy indicate caecal intubation essential make reliable screen tool colorectal cancer polyp . Cecal intubation rate highly variable dependent individual experience . Colonic loop common cause incomplete colonoscopy . Magnetic endoscope imaging ( MEI ) non-radiological imaging technique provide real time , three-dimensional image position colonoscope procedure . It may facilitate straighten colonic loop hence cecal intubation . The investigator aim evaluate benefit MEI term cecal intubation rate across endoscopists level experience making use newly develop Endoscopy Position Detecting Unit ( UPD-3 ) Olympus Optical Co , Ltd , Japan . The investigator propose conduct prospective randomize control trial compare caecal intubation rate colonoscopy perform without UPD-3 guidance . Colonoscopies perform endoscopists different level experience randomize UPD-3 guide group conventional group ( UPD-3 guidance ) . Patient control sedation ( PCS ) contain propofol alfentanil give patient . The investigator hypothesize UPD-3 guide colonoscopy associate high caecal intubation rate ( complete colonoscopy ) , short time caecum , less patient pain lower sedative medication requirement . A high caecal intubation rate facilitates reliable colonoscopy screening . Decreased colonic loop short time caecum may reduce patient discomfort procedure . It may also facilitate learn acquire skill colonoscopy trainee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis UPD guide colonoscopy improve cecal intubation rate . Methods Trial design This prospective randomized control trial compare cecal intubation rate colonoscopy perform without UPD guidance endoscopists different level experience . The trial conduct Endoscopy Unit university affiliate hospital . Patients elective colonoscopy Endoscopy Unit study period , meet follow inclusion criterion recruit . The colonoscopy do 6 dedicated endoscopists different level experience perform colonoscopy . Interventions UPD-3 specific colonoscope in-built magnetic imaging facility ( Olympus Optical Co , Ltd , Japan ) use examination . A mobile sensor attach assistant 's hand , hand position relation colonoscope could show imager screen . Patient control sedation ( PCS ) give patient . It deliver mean Graseby 3300 PCA pump ( Graseby Medical Ltd ) , use mixture propofol ( 200mg 20ml ) alfentanil ( 0.5mg 1ml ) 25-ml syringe . The drug deliver response pressure hand-held button control patient . Each bolus ( 0.5ml ) delivers 4.8mg propofol 12microgram alfentanil . No load dose use lock-out time PCA machine set zero . All patient instruct use hand-held button colonoscopy . Nasal oxygen ( 2l/min ) give patient , oxygen saturation blood pressure continuously monitor throughout procedure . The procedure randomize either colonoscopist viewing imager screen . UPD guide group : Both colonoscopist assistant view imager screen whole procedure . Information colonoscopy looping interpret documented colonoscopist . Anterior-position view standard reference . When abdominal compression require , assistant nurse hand hold probe attach , abdominal compression guide image . Conventional group ( non- UPD guide ) : The imager screen turn side colonoscopist assistant blind UPD image . When colonoscopist encounter looping defined paradoxical movement tip disproportionate advancement endoscopic view shaft insertion , colonoscopist request estimate type loop form . The image capture late interpretation . The primary outcome cecal intubation rate . Cecal intubation define visualization appendix orifice ileocaecal valve , procedure start trainee take supervisor caecal intubation regard incomplete . Sample size The cecal intubation rate could increase least 11 % trainee randomize trial Shah [ 14 ] 16 % trainee experienced endoscopist another trial [ 15 ] . Since overall cecal intubation rate Endoscopy unit without UPD guide least 90 % already , investigator expect modest benefit UPD guidance . Assume difference 5 % caecal intubation rate ( 90 % conventional group 95 % UPD guide group ) power 80 % type I error 5 % , 2 side analysis , 435 patient need group . Thus sample size 870 patient require . Randomization Informed consent obtain colonoscopy Endoscopy Unit , patient fulfils inclusion criterion . Block randomization do 1:1 basis , ensure equal number UPD guide conventional colonoscopy do endoscopist . A sealed non-opaque envelope ( produce accord computer generate random sequence ) open determine appropriate limb entry scope insertion . It possible blind study . Statistical analysis The data analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . The chi-squared test ( Fisher 's exact test appropriate ) , Student 's t-test , Mann-Whitney U test use compare categorical , parametric , non-parametric data , respectively . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Planned interim analysis conduct recruit 50 % patient . Data collection Data collect in-charged endoscopist assistant procedure standardize data sheet . Accrual rate It expect 20 case per week recruit randomization . The study could finish around 1 year time .</detailed_description>
