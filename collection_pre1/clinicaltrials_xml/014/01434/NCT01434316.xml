	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability ABT-888 ( veliparib ) SCH727965 ( dinaciclib ) patient advance solid tumor . II . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) ABT-888 combination SCH727965 , determine evaluate feasibility , safety , dose-limiting toxicity , maximally tolerate dose ( ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To confirm safety combination ABT-888 SCH727965 patient know BRCA1 BRCA2 germline mutation . II . To characterize pharmacokinetic parameter ABT-888 alone combination SCH727965 . III . To assess pharmacodynamic effect ABT-888 combination SCH727965 , surrogate tissue tumor . IV . To assess preliminary antitumor activity ABT-888/SCH727965 combination subject solid tumor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib dinaciclib follow expanded doublet cohort study non-breast BRCA-proficient patient BRCA-proficient triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient , safety doublet cohort BRCA-deficient patient , cohort BRCA-associated TNBC ( PARP inhibitor-naive PARP inhibitor-resistant ) . PART 1A : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 dinaciclib intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 8 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART 1B : Patients receive veliparib dinaciclib patient Part 1A . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART 1C : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-7 course 0 . Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-21 dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
