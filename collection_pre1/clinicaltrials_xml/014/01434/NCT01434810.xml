	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine safety efficacy filter sunlight phototherapy . Sunlight filter flexible ( window-tinting ) film . The subject population neonate bear Island Maternity Hospital , Lagos , Nigeria . The rationale conduct study Nigeria , country may effective commercial light device reliable access electric power operate , filter sunlight phototherapy might offer safe effective treatment neonatal jaundice . Phase I study focused safety efficacy filter sunlight phototherapy . Phase II study randomize control non-inferiority clinical trial compare efficacy filter sunlight phototherapy conventional phototherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Neonatal Jaundice With Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy : Safety Efficacy African Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study resource-limited country suggest severe neonatal jaundice ( NNJ ) represent large unrecognized cause neonatal morbidity mortality world . Several study Africa rank jaundice lead cause death newborn nursery . In Nigeria , Owa Osinaike report jaundice ( 14 % ) second lead cause death , Ugwu et al , find mortality severe jaundice comparable birth asphyxia great sepsis neonate &gt; 24 hr old 7 day old . In Kenya , English et al report NNJ third lead cause newborn admission death . Studies Nigeria , Zimbabwe , Turkey , North Vietnam , Oman , India list acute bilirubin encephalopathy ( ABE ) and/or severe NNJ significant cause morbidity , many require exchange blood transfusion ( EBT ) nursery . Unfortunately , phototherapy , important , may available many infant NNJ country lack device and/or unreliable electrical power supply . Commercial phototherapy ( PT ) device expensive , often break due surge electrical power , difficult maintain due unavailability spare part . Even PT device available , hospital country lack resource replace fluorescent light bulb recommend 2000-3000 hr use simply leave ineffective tube place burn . Moreover , hospital appropriate irradiance meter monitor intensity blue light emit lamp . In recent study Nigeria Owa et al , none test PT device provide level irradiance require intensive PT . Often , treatment healthcare provider suggest parents/guardians jaundice infant place baby sunlight . However , practice unsuitable due several safety concern . For instance , exposure ultraviolet ( UV ) light may cause sunburn , infrared ( IR ) light may cause body overheat . Moreover , infant may lose body heat uncovered skin treatment , potential dehydration . A safer , yet practical economical , solution need , provide basis proposal filter sunlight PT . The primary aim study safety , efficacy non-inferiority filter sunlight phototherapy compare conventional phototherapy . Phase I study focused safety efficacy filter sunlight phototherapy . Phase II focus non-inferiority efficacy compare conventional phototherapy continue evaluate safety .</detailed_description>
