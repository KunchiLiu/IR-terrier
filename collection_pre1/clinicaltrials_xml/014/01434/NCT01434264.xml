	<brief_summary>Energy healing among commonly use form complementary alternative medicine among cancer patient . There , however , study effect energy heal cancer cancer associate symptom none volume quality allow reliable conclusion drawn . Qualitative study energy heal Denmark demonstrate intervention individualize expect outcomes personalize . This research point need research design evaluate personalize outcomes individualized treatment time adhere general demand external internal validity . The objective study test effectiveness energy heal individualized rehabilitative intervention improve outcome personal choice among person complete conventional intended curative treatment colorectal , breast prostate cancer . The study design pragmatic clinical trial personalize outcomes . The study attempt maximize external validity use design incorporate important feature energy heal administer real-life setting : 1a ) allow participant self-selection heal non-healing control , 1b ) assess individual participant-selected treatment goal , 1c ) allow treatment perform private clinic healer . To maximize internal validity similar obtain randomize , clinical trial design , study 2a ) randomize participant self-selection randomized group intervention control ; 2b ) supplement assessment personalize treatment goal assessment outcomes standardized measure . The study account number possible moderator effect , include 3a ) socio-demographics 3b ) previous experience complementary alternative treatment . Outcome measure assess questionnaire , physical measurement , data administrative registry well semi-structured interview participant observation . Possible pattern various form data examine concordance discrepancy .

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND HYPOTHESES The primary outcome investigate whether `` energy healing '' individualize form treatment improve personal concern identify individual patient MYCaW questionnaire . Hypotheses : - The effect find large primary , personalize , outcome ( MYCaW ) assess standardized measure . - Patients self-select energy heal experience large effect primary outcome patient randomize intervention . - The primary , personalized outcome change course treatment intervention group control group . SECONDARY OUTCOMES AND HYPOTHESES Secondary outcome concern three independent relate area : ( 1 ) Will energy heal statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) effect secondary outcome assess standardize , validated instrument , include physical health survey , physical activity , cancer-related QoL , depressive symptom , mood ? ( 2 ) Will energy heal positive impact daily physical performance subjectively describe dairy ? ( 3 ) Will energy heal influence participant ' subjective experience illness recovery ? ( 4 ) Will energy heal influence participant ' self-reported burden late effect cancer treatment ? Hypotheses : - No significant effect heal secondary , standardized , outcome ( Physical health survey , physical activity , QoL , Depressive symptom , mood ) anticipate . - No significant effect level daily physical performance report diary anticipate . - Participants self-select energy heal report significantly large effect secondary outcome patient randomize intervention . - No significant effect participant ' self-reported burden late effect anticipate . Further , expect qualitative analysis inform whether energy heal provide participant image embody perception self , illness recovery whether acknowledge participant meaningful particular situation embed . HYPOTEHSES RELATED TO MEDIATION AND MODERATION OF EFFECTS A number factor anticipate mediate moderate effect energy healing . Hypotheses : - The effect heal large , participant report high level `` absorption '' ( i.e . `` openness experience '' ) - report high expectation benefit - report previous positive experience CAM - report positive attitude towards CAM - report prior experience energy heal - report faith God high spiritual power - experience well healer-patient relationship - Those change primary select outcome course treatment score high questionnaire relate healer-patient relationship . Further , expect qualitative analysis shed light whether - participant subjectively express change perception self illness correspond healer 's recommendation ; - ritualization heal session provide participant ' subjective acknowledgement healer-patient relationship ; The quantitative qualitative data combination expect confirm follow hypothesis : - If healer able ritualize , orchestrate 'key ' performance heal ritual mean stylistic device e.g . burn incense , music , etc. , he/she skilled symbol manager , participant subjectively acknowledge aspect , participant score high standardized questionnaire . TERTIARY OUTCOMES Finally , number issue explore relate value attribute treatment participant . It explore : - How much money participant intervention group willing spend kind therapy - How far distance participant willing drive receive kind therapy STUDY DESIGN The study pragmatic trial allow healer adjust intervention ( energy heal ) participant undertake treatment-related communication usual . The study design allow analysis implication self-selection randomize participant self-selection arm randomize arm , arm corresponding control group . Finally , study design allow participant identify consider primary outcome use open outcome form semi-structured interview conjunction validate , standard measure . In order encompass expect variation primary outcome investigate interrelation different type outcome , study design cross-disciplinary investigation . RECRUITMENT 125 person treatment group 200 person control group recruit two way ; 1 ) Lists patient complete hospital treatment colorectal , breast prostate cancer within last 12 month extract The National Patient Registry , , 2 ) list patient complete intended curative treatment colorectal cancer within last month provide involved hospital department Region Southern Denmark . All patient consider eligible randomize self-selection arm ( SSA ) randomization arm ( RA ) mail : 1 ) A letter invite participate study , 2 ) Information study group assign , 3 ) A baseline questionnaire , 4 ) An informed consent form , allow contact research team healer , 5 ) A pre-paid return envelope . All invited person contact telephone order answer question may concern study . Persons willing participate ask complete baseline questionnaire inform consent form return . Persons unwilling participate ask reason drop-out register establish . After two consecutive reminder call response , participant consider drop-out ( see Figure 1 ) . After allocation participant healer , healer contact telephone letter information participant repetition procedure follow . The healer arrange contact participant assign receive energy heal within two day order agree date first session . All project procedure administer organize use encrypted ACCESS database align study protocol procedure . Day-to-day data collection activity thus base computerized enquiry , procedural unplanned event , i.e . patient telephone call , register . RANDOMIZATION Possible participant initially first contact randomize SSA RA centralize , computerized procedure , e.g . Minim ( Minimisation Program Allocating Patients Treatments Clinical Trials ) . Stratified ; The sample stratify accord type cancer gender . Following reception baseline questionnaire inform consent form group randomize RA , RA randomize intervention control group similar procedure . ASSESSMENT Questionnaires : Baseline questionnaire administrate first treatment . Additional questionnaire package administer participant 10 day , 10 week 18 week baseline . Additionally , heal intervention group complete questionnaire package immediately third heal session . For comparison control group complete questionnaire package 6 week baseline . Diaries : 20 participant four group ask fill activity diary ( conc . activity sleep strenuous activity ) time consumption ( minute hour ) day . The activity diary complete seven day baseline , seven day week 10 seven day week 18 . Qualitative semi-structured interview : 8 participant two intervention group control group include qualitative interview participant observation . The interview participant-observation conduct treatment enable comparison disposition process change . Interviewees select ascertain distribution age previous use CAM ( particularly energy heal ) . All interview record participant comfortable . Participant-observation : 12 participant follow 1 day 's participant-observation first treatment 2 day ' participant-observation final treatment setting , patient consider important domains his/her life 'returning-to-life ' process . Further , participant-observation conduct clinic involve trial .</detailed_description>
