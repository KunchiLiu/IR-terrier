	<brief_summary>This protocol detail novel myocardial perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) protocol wherein patient receive low-dose ( 6 mCi ) Tc-99m sestamibi exercise regadenoson pharmacologic stress undergo full-time SPECT acquisition process Wide Beam Reconstruction ( WBR ) . Immediately thereafter patient receive high-dose ( 30-35 mCi ) Tc-99m sestamibi rest undergo half-time rest scan , also process WBR . All enrol research subject undergo initial stress subsequent rest scan . The radiation exposure associate new stress/rest protocol equivalent conventional rest/stress protocol presently routine clinical us SLRHC . Eventually , novel stress/rest protocol adopt routine clinical practice , patient normal stress scan would receive 6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi ( 331 mSv men , 241 mSv woman ) spend approximately one hour Nuclear Medicine Laboratory . All patient present Nuclear Medicine Laboratory evaluation know suspected coronary artery disease candidate enrollment . Fifty patient undergo treadmill exercise stress 50 patient undergoing regadenoson pharmacologic stress enrol . Pregnant breast-feeding patient eligible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : To validate acceptable image quality stress/rest myocardial count density ratio ( define ) Rapid Stress/Rest Protocol Experimental Design Methods : Validation stress/rest myocardial count density ratio achieve use standard rest/stress protocol incorporate conventional 3:1 stress/rest Tc-99m radiopharmaceutical dose ratio . Human subject : To determine stress/rest myocardial count density ratio encounter use exist rest/stress imaging protocol routine clinical practice , 100 consecutive patient undergo either exercise pharmacologic stress ( dipyridamole regadenoson ) myocardial perfusion SPECT include . The stress/rest Tc-99m sestamibi/Tc-99m tetrofosmin radiopharmaceutical dose ratio 3:1 patient . Stress rest maximal myocardial count determine reconstructed tomograms use Evolution software ( GE Healthcare ) . The Investigational , novel stress/rest protocol : Human Subjects : Characteristics Plans Recruitment 100 patient , give consent , present myocardial perfusion SPECT exercise pharmacologic stress clinically indicate enrolled prospectively . There bias selection patient regard gender racial/ethnic composition . 50 patient stressed exercise . 50 additional patient receive pharmacologic stress on-label dose Regadenoson . All patient receive appropriate dose radiotracer accord size weight . Pregnant woman breast feed enrol . Patient Informed Consent : Written inform consent obtain either Principal Investigator , PI 's research assistant ( physician ) , Nuclear Medicine resident , Cardiology fellow ( supervise monitor stress test ) . Methods - Imaging Data Analysis : The rapid stress/rest protocol , describe , perform use GE Ventri , MG Maxxus dual-head supine scintillation camera UltraSPECT Wide Beam Reconstruction ( WBR ) software . Both stress rest SPECT perform patient , even initial stress image normal . Images interpret report standard fashion clinical patient management , characterize perfusion defect term location , extent , severity , reversibility , function term volume , regional wall motion wall thickening . Patient flow : 1 . Upon arrival Nuclear Medicine Laboratory , patient interview regard medical history limited physical examination perform ( routinely perform clinically-indicated myocardial perfusion scan ) , informed consent obtain enrollment research study . 2 . Patients able perform treadmill exercise 85 % age-predicted maximum heart rate undergo treadmill exercise stress . In remainder patient pharmacologic stress achieve intravenous regadenoson . A stress dose 5-7 mCi ( adjust patient weight chest circumference ) Tc-99m sestamibi administer intravenously . 3 . Post-stress gate SPECT acquire 30-60 min . thereafter use full-time stress ( 12 min . ) acquisition protocol , process use `` half-time '' Wide Beam Reconstruction software ( i.e . `` half-dose '' WBR protocol ) . 4 . Within 60 minute thereafter patient receive additional intravenous dose 35-42 mCi ( adjust patient weight chest circumference ) Tc-99m sestamibi rest . 5 . Resting gated SPECT acquire 40-60 minute thereafter use half-time resting ( 7.5 min . ) acquisition protocol , process use `` half-time '' Wide Beam Reconstruction software ( i.e . half-time '' WBR protocol ) . 6 . The estimated time entire study approximately 3 hr , slightly less time fro standard rest/stress protocol investigator use . Scans assess image quality use 5-point subjective scale use several report investigator publish previously ( reference # 2 # 3 ) : The image quality stress rest perfusion tomograms gate tomograms grade visually use 5-point scale : 1 ( poor ) - 5 ( excellent ) . Myocardial count density uniformity , endocardial epicardial edge definition , visualization definition right ventricle , background noise parameter consider subjectively grade image quality . In addition attribute consider grade sum perfusion tomograms , definition leave ventricular cavity end-systole temporal smoothness gate frame also consider grade post-stress rest gate image . Stress rest absolute myocardial count density stress : rest myocardial count density ratio determine processed tomograms use General Electric Xeleris computer software . Count density basically `` information density '' scan . In general , nuclear imaging , high count density , good image quality , low incidence scan artifact , great clinical value scan . The rest/stress myocardial count density ratio achieve use novel low-dose stress/high-dose rest protocol compare stress/rest ratio achieve use conventional rest/stress protocol ( describe ) . The unpaired Student 's t-test use . In addition rest/stress count density achieve use exercise ( 50 patient ) regadenoson ( 50 patient ) novel protocol compare stress/rest ratio achieve use standard rest/stress image exercise ( 59 patient ) regadenoson ( 29 patient ) subgroup . Primary Endpoint 1 : Comparison myocardial count density ratio test group use Rapid Protocol vs. myocardial count density ratio Traditional protocol control group . Secondary Endpoints 1 . Image quality 2 . # patient normal stress study may stress-only study . 3 . Reduction radiation exposure Test ( Rapid ) Control ( Traditional ) group 4 . Comparison absolute stress rest myocardial count density Test Control group 5 . Start finish time , potential cost saving two group 6 . Comparison total radiopharmaceutical dose two group Study Duration : 1 year Statistical Plan : Primary endpoint : The individual stress rest , well stress : rest myocardial count density ratio determine test group process tomograms compare control group use UNPAIRED T TEST Secondary : The image quality test group stress rest perfusion tomograms gate tomograms grade visually use 5-point scale : 1 ( poor ) - 5 ( excellent ) , compare control group use UNPAIRED T TEST . The overall reduction radiation exposure test group analyze use , comparator , patient size weight base radiopharmaceutical dose imaging time use standard Stress/Rest Protocol . The time cost saving associate forgo rest study patient normal stress scan calculate . Based control group mean maximum contrast dose ( MCD ) 4.4 standard deviation 9.5 , study great 80 % power detect 0.3 difference MCD ratio . ( Alpha=5 % )</detailed_description>
