	<brief_title>Phase II Study First-line SBRT Patients With Non-Metastatic Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment cancer pancreas surgery ( possible ) , external beam radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy . These standard treatment cure often extend life month . Recently , new approach develop , call stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . Based result earlier study use SBRT , study doctor Moffitt feel reasonable alternative standard treatment disease . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) delivers high radiation dos tumor every day 5 day give usual 5-6 week course radiation less week . It also show much less side effect . The purpose study see SBRT good way treat pancreas cancer find effect , good and/or bad , treatment cancer . Six patient ask part subgroup call TBRI ( Tissue , Blood , Research Imaging ) . In subgroup , investigator want study early death tumor cell treatment look tumor use PET/CT scan biopsy , test body 's white blood cell take procedure call leukapheresis . You take part TBRI subgroup get treatment study SBRT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All Patients : Biopsy proven , nonmetastatic , pancreatic cancer Unresectable disease base institutional standardized criterion unresectability Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 CT scan chest abdomen ( 3phase pancreas protocol ) , PETCT within 4 week study entry Patients biliary gastroduodenal obstruction must drainage , duodenal stenting , gastric bypass prior initiate radiation All disease must encompass single radiation field No evidence history autoimmune dysfunction Negative pregnancy test within 7 day study entry No prior concurrent chemotherapy No previous concurrent immunotherapy pancreatic cancer Liver enzymes ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) : total bilirubin ( Tbili ) ≤ 3.9 ( biliary stent allow ) ; aspartic transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 177 ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 198 ; Alkaline phosphatase ( ALKP ) ≤ 378 Adequate pretreatment organ function : Creatinine great 1.5mg/dL ; Total calcium great 11.0mg/dL ; prothrombin time ( PT ) great 14 second ; partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) great 40 second Ability give inform consent Adequate baseline hematopoietic function : total white blood cell count equal great 3,000/mm³ ; absolute granulocyte count great 1,500/mm³ ; absolute lymphocyte count great 500/mm³ ; platelet count equal great 100,000/mm³ Inclusion Criteria TBRI Group : All Participant inclusion criterion Amenable leukapheresis determine leukapheresis nurse Primary tumor accessible direct intratumoral injection CTguidance confirm interventional radiologist No history autoimmune disease No history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) immunosuppressive diseases No active viral bacterial infection No use steroid immunosuppressive drug least 4 week prior enrollment study Exclusion Criteria All Patients : Prior history radiotherapy overlap plan port primary pancreatic tumor Patients tumor accessible direct access include study . Prior concurrent chemotherapy Prior history antineoplastic therapy irradiation Prior treatment antitumor vaccine allow Patients history autoimmune diseases A history HIV infection , AIDS immunosuppressive disease state . The need exclude patient HIV/AIDS one endpoints study immune response . People HIV compromise immune system enrollment study could confound result ( TBRI ) Patients require corticosteroid ineligible one endpoint study immune response . Since steroid modulate immune system , enrollment patient steroid could confound result . There must use corticosteroid fours week precede entry study ( TBRI ) . Active bacterial , fungal viral infection Active bleeding ( hemoptysis , melena , etc . ) Women currently pregnant actively breast feeding . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test must use effective contraception trial participation Any medical psychiatric illness opinion principal investigator might compromise patient 's ability tolerate complete treatment Any patient require blood thinner ( due risk gastrointestinal [ GI ] bleed )</criteria>
