	<brief_summary>This purpose research project test diagnostic accuracy ( i.e. , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , receiver operator curve area curve ) cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion compare best non-invasive test blood flow -- cardiac positron emission transmission ( PET ) perfusion image . The primary outcome study determine CT perfusion technique high overall diagnostic accuracy measure high area receiver operator curve . The investigator test 4 different CT perfusion technique . ( A ) Qualitative , visual inspection contrast-enhanced CT image ( B ) Enhanced voxel distribution analysis ( C ) Rate myocardial contrast enhancement analysis ( D ) Quantitative heart blood flow use distribute 2-region analysis A second aim reduce radiation dose need maintain CT perfusion diagnostic accuracy . Using CT perfusion data , investigator model minimal number cardiac cycle radiation exposure need keep diagnostic accuracy similar full data set . A third aim test incremental diagnostic accuracy CT angiography plus CT perfusion identify region low blood flow compare PET perfusion alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chest pain symptom occur result blockage artery supply heart ; artery call `` coronary artery '' . Blockages coronary artery may decrease blood flow oxygen delivery heart muscle , cause chest pain `` anginal '' symptom . Coronary angiography commonly use test visualize coronary artery disease blockage may provide answer physician need assess patient symptom like chest pain . Two option coronary angiography exist , invasive angiography cardiac compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) . CCTA complete inject contrast peripheral vein ( artery ) image coronary artery fill contrast . The imaged coronary artery may block partially , completely . While blockage occludes great 70 % artery highly correlate chest pain anginal symptom , occlusion 40 % may may decrease heart blood flow . Often multiple image study need evaluate whether blood flow decrease set partial coronary artery blockage include non-invasive heart image assess heart blood flow . One type nuclear imaging term positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In order differentiate blockage poor heart perfusion activity , nuclear PET image take rest , flow normal , repeat investigator `` stress '' heart medication . If blood flow decrease stress , `` defect '' PET image see . An alternative , non-invasive technique test heart blood flow/perfusion measure heart blood flow compute tomography ( CT ) contrast go come . Preliminary study animal human assess heart blood flow/perfusion use contrast-enhanced cardiac CT promising , work need . Combining CCTA CT blood flow/perfusion measurement set could lead single , accurate diagnostic test measure coronary artery blockage well blood flow . One limitation CT imaging amount radiation give . The CCTA radiation dose currently less nuclear PET image invasive coronary angiography . However , CT blood flow imaging add routine CCTA ass heart perfusion coronary blockage one test , radiation dose may higher . The primary purpose research project test diagnostic accuracy various cardiac CT perfusion technique compare best non-invasive test blood flow , cardiac PET perfusion imaging . The investigator goal use least amount radiation achieve high diagnostic accuracy CCTA well CT blood flow/perfusion . The investigator goal CT heart blood flow/perfusion radiation dose less nuclear blood flow imaging . The investigator estimate need 4 low radiation dose image heart allow accurate heart blood flow measurement .</detailed_description>
