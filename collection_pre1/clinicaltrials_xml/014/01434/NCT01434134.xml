	<brief_title>Prevention Cardiac Dysfunction During Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one common malignancy woman . Recent progress detection treatment breast cancer result survival gain , consequence therapeutic advance increase number long-term survivor may risk development cardiovascular disease . Several study suggest woman treat breast cancer may increase risk cardiovascular disease , probable cause multi-factorial . Importantly , therapy breast cancer , include radiotherapy , anti-HER-2 regimen certain chemotherapeutic regimen , may increase risk subsequent cardiovascular disease , include atherosclerotic disease , leave ventricular dysfunction , heart failure . In current study propose undertake randomize , placebo-controlled , 2x2 factorial , double-blind trial ass whether leave ventricular dysfunction and/or injury preventable , completely partly , concomitant administration angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , candesartan , beta blocker , metoprolol , postoperative chemotherapy radiotherapy . The propose study address important clinical problem large patient group . Thus , possibility prevent cardiovascular side effect contemporary therapy breast cancer important clinically scientifically .</detailed_description>
