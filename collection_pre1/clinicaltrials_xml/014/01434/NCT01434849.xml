	<brief_title>Timolol Prevention Proliferation Infantile Hemangioma ( TiPPIH Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infantile hemangioma ( IH ) among common , benign vascular tumor infancy estimate prevalence 4-5 % population . IH find birth become evident within first week life . They characterize rapid proliferative phase last 4-6 month long period minimal absent growth involutive phase may resolve minimal scar multiple year . Although frequently think benign lesion , hemangioma occur location cause functional impairment vital organ , lead ulceration , scar disfigurement , lead life-threatening complication . Management problematic IH include laser , long-term systemic corticosteroid , interferon , Vincristine , surgery , recently systemic propranolol . Pulsed-dye laser treatment approve FDA ; useful superficial hemangioma little effect subcutaneous deep-seated hemangioma . The propose therapeutic effect propranolol vasoconstriction , decrease expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGR ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) gene downregulation Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , apoptosis capillary endothelial cell . For periorbital lesion may cause amblyopia anisometropia , topical Timolol report benefit . There one retrospective review proof concept show topical timolol safe effective treatment 6 case IH . The advantage topical therapy decrease risk systemic side effect compare oral intravenous administration . The disadvantage limited penetration may preclude effectiveness thicker deeper lesion . Being low birth weight well prematurity know risk factor IH . In premature infant development clinic University Texas Health Science Center San Antonio infant less 1500 gram birth weight follow three year follow discharge Newborn Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) ; approximately 16 % infant hemangioma . Therefore investigator find reasonable start treatment topical beta blocker early stage hemangioma prevent growth proliferation hence possible severe effect associate growth thus impairment vital organs/tissues .</detailed_description>
