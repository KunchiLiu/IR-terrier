	<brief_summary>Development bio-behavioral stochastic model-predictive controller ( SMPC ) use artificial pancreas T1DM require fundamental behavioral physiology study , well translational model engineering development . In order successful , closed-loop control Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) must adapt individual physiologic characteristic behavioral profile person . An essential part adaptation biosystem ( patient ) observation . The investigator propose lay foundation closed-loop control system include algorithmic observer patient ' behavior metabolic state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Behavioral Observer Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intensive descriptive study follow 60 adult T1DM currently experience insulin pump use two-week training period plus one month active study period DexCom SEVEN® PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) use tandem OmniPod® Insulin Management System . The OmniPod® build FreeStyle glucometer allow tag food activity-related treatment behavior self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) value . The OmniPod® personal digital assistant ( PDA ) also store information insulin delivery meal size relation carbohydrate content . Parallel record CGM behavioral data , well psychometric instrument produce rich synchronize data set person ultimately lead development behavioral event generator use future open-loop closed-loop control algorithms intelligent insulin dosing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( defined American Diabetes Association criterion judgment physician ) least two year prior enrollment study . Use insulin pump treat diabetes least six month . Actively use bolus calculator function current insulin pump predefined parameter glucose goal , carbohydrate ratio , insulin sensitivity factor . Age 21 65 year . The investigator study child since DexCom Seven® Plus approve use child . Adults age 65 likely medical exclusion followup Phase 2 study , involve induced hypoglycemia . Willingness participate study 6 week wear DexCom Seven® Plus CGM OmniPod® insulin pump , perform selfmonitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) integral FreeStyle glucometer 4 time per day ( meal bedtime ) addition SMBG require calibrate CGM validate low high BG alarm ( &lt; 70 mg/dl &gt; 300 mg/dl ) , record behavioral event tag SMGB value throughout study meal activity descriptor . Willingness avoid consumption acetaminophencontaining product duration study . Demonstration proper mental status cognition completion study . Pregnancy Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g . mental retardation , substance abuse ) History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans Known bleed diathesis dyscrasia Active enrollment another clinical trial Medical requirement acetaminophencontaining product study period 1 week Medical condition would make operating CGM insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , extensive scar tissue sit device insert ) . Need magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) study .</criteria>
