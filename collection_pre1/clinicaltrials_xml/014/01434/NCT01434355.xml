	<brief_title>DNA Analysis Samples From Younger Patients With Germ Cell Tumors Their Parents Siblings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association genetic variation pediatric germ cell tumor ( GCT ) use case-parent triad design identify variant four gene , KITLG , SPRY4 , BAK1 , DMRT1 , associate pediatric GCT . II . To evaluate association genetic variation pediatric GCT use case-parent triad design include target genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) select key pathway essential normal utero germ cell development , specifically gene involve survival germ cell migration , apoptosis , cell cycle control . III . To explore inter- intratumoral heterogeneity DNA methylation tumor histology . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients parent sibling undergo saliva sample collection . DNA extract saliva sample patient ' archive tumor tissue sample genotyped analyzed methylation array , include methylation-specific polymerasechain reaction ( PCR ) ( pyrosequencing ) assay . Genetic variation pediatric germ cell tumor parent sibling also analyze . Patients ' family member ' health history , demographic , environmental exposure collect questionnaire telephone interview . Medical history , chronic condition , prescribe medication congenital abnormality , include cryptorchidism , also collect . Birth characteristic child , include birth weight gestational age , also capture .</detailed_description>
