	<detailed_description>Rationale : Hypotension preterm infant ( gestational age [ GA ] &lt; 32wks ) frequently occur clinical problem . Although real consensus reach definition hypotension preterm baby , clinical practice mean blood pressure ( BP ) mmHg low GA age week consider start point anti-hypotensive therapy . However , although association neonatal hypotension mortality morbidity exist , evidence causation hypotension neonatal mortality morbidity ( include neurodevelopmental outcome 2 3 year age ) . In addition , use mean BP alone indication treatment neonatal cardiovascular compromise without take consideration information status tissue perfusion may lead unnecessary exposure neonates forceful vasoactive medication potentially cause harm extremely vulnerable patient . Objective : To compare neonatal mortality short-term ( advanced MRI index structural brain injury 40 week ' GA ) long-term neurodevelopmental outcome ( Bayley scale infant development III [ BSID-III ] 24 month ) two group preterm infant present hypotension without clinical laboratory evidence compromise tissue perfusion first 72 postnatal hour ( 3 day ) . Hypotension define mean BP ( mm Hg ) low infant 's GA ( week ) . Patients randomize `` Group A '' treat accord treatment policy operative Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) Wilhelmina Children 's Hospital/University Medical Centre Utrecht ( UMCU ) `` Group B '' receive cardiovascular support hypotension unless mean BP low current limit minus 5 mmHg and/or evidence compromise tissue perfusion end-organ function thus meet established criterion ( see ) . Study design : A single-centre randomized non-blinded cohort study NICU UMCU preterm neonates &lt; 30 week ' gestation postnatal day 0 3 . Study population : All preterm infant GA &lt; 30 week admit day postnatal life 0 NICU UMCU . Patients manage accord randomization Group A B end postnatal day 3 . Intervention Patients randomize `` Group A '' treat hypotension accord treatment protocol operative NICU UMCU . Patients randomize `` Group B '' receive cardiovascular supportive therapy irrespective BP value unless mean BP &gt; 5 mmHg GA week 30 minute and/or indirect clinical direct laboratory evidence tissue hypoperfusion and/or end-organ dysfunction ( i.e . rScO2 &lt; 50 % despite optimized ventilatory support FiO2 administration , plasma lactate &gt; 6 mmol/L ; and/or urine output &lt; 0.6 mL/kg/hour ) . As CO2 potent regulator cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , understandable change arterial CO2 tension ( PaCO2 ) associate increased incidence peri-intraventricular hemorrhage ( PIVH ) preterm neonate significant hypercapnia white matter injury ( periventricular leukomalacia ; PVL ) preterm neonate hypocapnia immediate postnatal period . Therefore , present study , ventilation closely follow PaCO2 value monitor attempted kept within normal limit ( 40-to-50 mmHg ) first three postnatal day control potential impact confound variable far primary secondary outcome measure concern ( see ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : To determine whether refrain ( group B ) anti-hypotensive treatment negative , positive effect composite outcome mortality neurodevelopmental outcome ( determined BSID-III ) 24 month age . Secondary outcome measure include 1 ) difference group incidence PIVH first 7 postnatal day detect head ultrasound , 2 ) difference incidence white matter injury PVL gray matter injury detect within first 7 day ultrasound use advanced MRI parameter brain adjust postmenstrual age 40 week well ability maintain CBF autoregulation first three postnatal day .</detailed_description>
