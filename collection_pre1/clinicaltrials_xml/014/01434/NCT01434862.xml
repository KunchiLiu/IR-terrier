	<brief_summary>This scientific research study look `` closed-loop '' system drug Pramlintide may work together improve blood sugar control people type 1 diabetes mellitus . Pramlintide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) give injection ( subcutaneous ) work insulin low blood sugar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pramlintide Combined With Model Predictive Control Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study test whether standard pramlintide treatment plus closed-loop insulin therapy efficacious control glycemia either individual therapy . The control algorithm effect insulin dose calculator mimicry basal insulin secretion estimate requirement basal rate insulin pump infusion base current past glucose level estimate Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) device prior insulin infusion . The closed-loop system-recommended insulin replace ( clinical setting ) basal rate insulin patient would normally use . The patient ' meal insulin need estimate use insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio per standard clinical practice optimize prior admission Clinical Research Unit . The primary goal feasibility study test hypothesis combination close loop system ( Open-Loop Informed Model Predicted Control ( MPC ) algorithm plus safety system module ( SSM ) ) pramlintide ( synthetic analog hormone amylin health release β-cells along insulin ) treatment improve glucose control versus individual therapy . Because pramlintide reduces hyperglycemia extremes generate meal close loop control markedly reduce risk hypoglycemia , thus represent potentially important complementary action reduce variability — investigator expect find decreased hyperglycemia simultaneously decrease hypoglycemia risk . Secondary goal explore factor associate achieve safer and/or effective close loop control . For example , base upon work animal model , one secondary goal explore whether moderate inhibition α-cell glucagon , know occur pramlintide administration early postprandial period , potential repair inadequate glucagon counterregulation .</detailed_description>
