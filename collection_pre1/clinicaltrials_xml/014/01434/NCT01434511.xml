	<criteria>Written inform consent/assent participant and/or participant 's parent legal representative . Participants congenital hemophilia A human factor VIII inhibitor ≤30 BU assess within 90 day prior study entry . Has previously currently demonstrate suboptimal hemostatic response bypass agent treatment bleed episode ; suboptimal response determine investigator , minimally include minimal evidence response least two dos bypass agent , either current historic bleeding episode . Has antiOBI1 titer ≤ 10 BU Has serious lifethreatening bleeding episode ; require surgical procedure could lead serious bleed episode well control . Is willing able follow instruction attend study visit . Has significant hemostatic abnormality : Platelets ≥100,000/mmcubed Prothrombin time &lt; 15 second INR &lt; 1.3 Participants take antithrombotics ( clopidogrel , heparin heparin analogue ) may include provide three halflives agent elapse since last dose agent . Hemodynamically unstable blood transfusion , fluid resuscitation pharmacologic volume replacement pressor therapy . This hemodynamic instability characterize symptomatic hypotension result vital organ dysfunction , cardiac ischemia , oliguria ( urine volume &lt; 0.5 mL/kg previous six hour ) , central nervous system hypoperfusion manifest mental status change confusion ( unless head injury intracranial hemorrhage present ) , pulmonary compromise , and/or acidosis ( manifest pH lactate level ) . Bleeding episode assess likely resolve leave untreated . Use hemophilia medication : recombinant factor VIIa within 3 hour prior OBI1 administration activate prothrombin complex concentrate ( aPCC ) treatment within 6 hour prior OBI1 administration Prior history bleed disorder congenital hemophilia A Known major sensitivity ( anaphylactoid reaction ) porcine hamster product . Examples include therapeutic porcine origin ( e.g . previously market porcine factor VIII , HyateC® ) recombinant therapeutic prepared hamster cell ( e.g . Humira® , Advate® Enbrel® ) . Received investigational treatment within 30 day first OBI1 treatment . Anticipated need treatment device study may interfere evaluation safety efficacy OBI1 , whose safety efficacy may affect OBI1 . Is plan father child study Has abnormal baseline finding , medical condition ( ) laboratory finding , opinion investigator , might jeopardize participant 's safety decrease chance obtain satisfactory data need achieve objective study . Inability unwillingness comply study design , protocol requirement , followup procedure .</criteria>
