	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose entinostat give together lapatinib ditosylate trastuzumab treat patient breast cancer spread original ( primary ) tumor distant organ distant lymph node recur ( come back ) near place original ( primary ) tumor , usually period time cancer could detect . Entinostat lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving entinostat together lapatinib ditosylate trastuzumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) entinostat combination lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) patient trastuzumab failed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ ( HER2+ ) metastatic breast cancer ( Phase I ) . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) entinostat combination lapatinib trastuzumab patient trastuzumab fail HER2+ metastatic breast cancer ( Phase I Trastuzumab Cohort ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity combination therapy entinostat lapatinib patient trastuzumab fail HER2+ metastatic breast cancer ( Phase I ) . II . To determine toxicity entinostat combination lapatinib trastuzumab patient trastuzumab fail HER2+ metastatic breast cancer ( Phase I Trastuzumab Cohort ) . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether 2-drug combination modulates expression HER2 , phosphorylated HER2 ( pHER ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , phosphorylated EGFR ( pEGFR ) , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) , phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) breast tumor and/or circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study entinostat . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) day 1 15 lapatinib tosylate PO day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients Phase I trastuzumab cohort also receive maintenance dose trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 3 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day toxicity resolve .</detailed_description>
