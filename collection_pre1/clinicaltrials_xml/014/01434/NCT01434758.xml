	<brief_summary>Detection M. tuberculosis clinical specimen child low sensitivity specimens either difficult collect contain low level M. tuberculosis . Diagnostic criterion non-specific culture confirmation challenging , sputum sample often obtainable small child specimens typically low yield . Although child typically think paucibacillary disease , great risk dissemination TB . This may allow detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis bodily fluids sputum gastric aspirate , include blood urine . Unfortunately , little know overall yield various specimen . From pilot data collect among adult child Tugela Ferry , know feasible collect test various bodily fluid specimen TB culture . This study aim test hypothesis blood urine culture detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis child suspect disseminated TB , proportion non-sputum bodily fluid detect drug-susceptible drug-resistant tuberculosis sputum gastric culture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Diagnostics Paediatric Tuberculosis Blood Culture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) major cause morbidity mortality among child develop nation . Symptom-based diagnostic criterion non-specific culture confirmation challenging , sputum sample often believe cumbersome obtain small child specimens typically low yield due paucibacillary nature pediatric TB . Culture confirmation may obtain 10 % case suspect pediatric TB . For reason , true extent ( drug-resistant ) TB epidemic child unknown . Thus , either clinician begin empiric treatment without diagnosis treatment give . Current laboratory method , available resource poor setting , employ smear expectorate sputa gastric aspirate low sensitivity child . While rapid diagnostic technique PCR base test develop , still poor sensitivity child . Improving diagnosis pediatric TB must focus good effort , include aggressive strategy uncover disseminate disease . Culture confirmation disseminate disease obtain blood , urine , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , peritoneal pleural fluid , purulent material lymph node aspirate , abscesses otorrhea . Unfortunately , little know overall yield various specimen child . From pilot data collect among child NHP , know feasible collect test various bodily fluid specimen TB culture . Although WHO guideline encourage body fluid collection order make diagnosis TB child , present NHP , blood urine culture obtain mycobacterial culture . However , study seek demonstrate routine investigation blood urine augment yield traditional sputum culture child disseminate disease likely . Improved culture confirmation allow DST accurate description drug-resistant TB epidemic child region .</detailed_description>
