	<brief_title>Patterns Early Hepatitis C Virus Decline Predict Outcome Interferon Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection rate China 3 % , mean 30 million patient . Combination therapy ribavirin interferon ( IFN ) standard clinical treatment HCV chronical infection . However , overall rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) still exceed 60 % even ribavirin peg-IFN . Due several virus- patient-related factor , treatment even less successful certain population , especially HCV genotype 1 infection . Thus standard therapy duration optimize accord virus genotype clinical practice . Nowadays , two direct antiviral agent ( DAAs ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) USA year , increase SVR rate . However , high price , side effect long duration render people hesitate addition third drug traditional prescription . Predicting outcome traditional therapy cornerstone personalize therapy HCV infect patient . In order obtain accurate prediction , different method try . Several indicator suggest predict final treatment outcome . Rapid Virus Response ( RVR ) , indicate non-detectable virus forth week since therapy start , use predict final treatment outcome.Other indicator , include virus genotype , host genotype IL-28B , human race interferon stimulate gene ( ISG ) expression also show relate able predict treatment outcomes extent . Here investigator propose HCV virus dynamic analysis give precise prediction therapy outcome . The general idea blood HCV titration data obtain continuously early treatment period ( first 6 week ) patient strictly follow therapy method . These titration data use draw virus dynamic curve calculate corresponding parameter individually . The parameter ( ) distinguish patient reach therapy evaluation standard fail reach evaluation standard select , parameter ( ) may use predict therapy outcome new patient early stage his/her treatment .</detailed_description>
