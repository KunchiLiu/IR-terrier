	<detailed_description>Following surgery radiation primary early-stage prostate cancer ( PrCA ) , one three patient experience elevation serum prostate antigen ( PSA ) within 10 year . For men whose primary treatment prostatectomy , PSA rise virtually always signal spread PrCA . After evidence recurrence , `` standard '' treatment medical surgical castration . Castration result reduce PSA 85 % time , make difference whether treatment occur appearance clinical symptom recurrence . This time interval first rise PSA symptom appearance may many year . The salient fact , however , castration prolong men 's life certain whether even meaningfully delay symptom appearance men receive treatment first sign biochemical recurrence . Castration also significant side effect include osteoporosis ( bone loss ) , decreased muscle mass , impotence , urinary incontinence . Because PrCA usually disease old men , many succumb disease ever develop symptom relate metastatic PrCA . For large fraction men , treatment deleterious affect quality life clear overall survival benefit may good choice . The protocol investigator propose perform instead medical surgical castration , medically indicate point course PrCA . Castration offer men first clinical symptom sign metastatic cancer , time men come study . It also important note intervention result reduction PSA investigator offer men randomize control condition initially . The investigator conduct randomize study 60 asymptomatic men undergone radical prostatectomy ( removal prostate gland ) primary therapy biopsy-confirmed adenocarcinoma prostate subsequently find rise PSA level , indicate early recurrence cancer . Half ( 30 ) men randomize usual care ( watchful wait ) half intervention consist vegetable-based diet , program physical activity time natural rhythm day ( i.e. , circadian , `` around day '' - basically time exercise improve sleep cycle ) , mindfulness-based stress reduction ( consist meditation stress-reducing technique ) . The intervention continue three month , follow monthly booster session 9 month . Data collect compliance intervention factor could modify intervention confuse interpretation effect . The overall goal study see effect make behavioral attitudinal change PSA level , indicator disease progression men . The therapy investigator study completely non-toxic behavioral nature .</detailed_description>
