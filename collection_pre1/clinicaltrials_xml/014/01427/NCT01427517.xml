	<brief_summary>The investigator interested determine investigator able detect change brain chemistry use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Gaucher 's disease ( GD ) , without neurological disorder ( healthy control ) give antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . This study combine information medical history , physical examination disease rating scale result obtain use MRS brain scan pharmacokinetic study blood sample . This research require 1 visit require 4 5 hour time . During study , participant provide medical history , examine undergo rating scale one hour ; brain scan pharmacokinetic study require 1.5-2 hour time ; total study take 4-5 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress implicate pathogenesis number neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Further , level glutathione ( GSH ) , prevalent endogenous antioxidant , decreased postmortem substantia nigra ( SN ) individual PD , indicate increase oxidative stress , although yet confirm vivo . Increases intracellular oxidative stress also observe primary fibroblast culture obtain patient GD , enzyme replacement therapy result increase total GSH . The hypothesis oxidative stress play key role neurodegeneration associate PD suggest antioxidant may useful alter disease progression . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) well-known antioxidant think act free radical scavenger cysteine donor synthesis GSH . NAC may beneficial treatment PD GD . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) method may able determine effect NAC central nervous system GSH level . In addition , use red blood cell ( RBC ) measurement GSH , correlate brain concentration , could serve easily measure biomarker help characterize monitor response therapy . The investigator therefore propose conduct study effect single , intravenous dose NAC central ( brain ) measure GSH peripheral ( RBC ) measure GSH people PD healthy control , use simultaneous MRS technique pharmacokinetic study . The investigator hypothesis specific aim follow : Hypothesis : RBC brain GSH concentration increase follow oral NAC administration individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Gaucher 's disease ( GD ) , control participant . Specific Aims : 1 . Quantitate baseline plasma red blood cell GSH concentration PD GD control ; characterize NAC GSH pharmacokinetics single intravenous NAC administration . 2 . Quantitate brain GSH level ( ascertain MRS ) PD GD control baseline single intravenous NAC administration simultaneously Aim 1 . 3 . Construct pharmacokinetic model evaluate relationship peripheral ( plasma RBC ) central ( brain ) GSH measurement .</detailed_description>
