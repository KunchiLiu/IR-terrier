	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Versus Noninvasive Ventilation Patients With Overlap Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lead cause disability death worldwide . Acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) , particular , serve marker accelerate disease course thus herald increase risk repetitive AECOPD episodes also deteriorate pulmonary function death ( 2 ) . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , occur combination COPD , increasingly recognize contributor AECOPD episodes . OSA consist repetitive sleep-related partial loss airway caliber arise increase transmural pressure favor luminal collapse . OSA estimate afflict 4 9 % population , prevalence anticipate climb hand-in-hand rise incidence obesity . The combination two disorder , arbitrarily label Overlap Syndrome ( OS ) , link great elevation arterial carbon dioxide tension pulmonary vascular resistance lower arterial oxygen tension see either component disorder isolation . Elevated pulmonary artery pressure may progress cause cor pulmonale , process whereby compensatory right ventricle remodeling , hypertrophy , eventually , florid heart failure . In set OSA , therapeutic gold standard nightly continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Essentially , CPAP machine function administer single continuous positive pressure airflow person 's airway via appropriately fit nasal mask . The applied pressure stent open partially occlude airway segment sleep . Though effective OSA OS , increasingly realize OS patient may exist reduction airway patency also ventilatory drive sleeping mean augment per breath volume may attain incremental benefit use CPAP alone . Although CPAP ineffective COPD , Bipap show benefit suggest patient OSA COPD may derive improvement health-related outcome use ventilation modality address underlying condition . Bipap function combine single flow CPAP second inspiratory pressure assist overcomes sleep-related airway resistance also increase magnitude breath result low diurnal carbon dioxide tension pulmonary artery pressure . Bipap may harbor mortality benefit COPD ; study result conflict . It unclear Bipap effective treat OSA usual CPAP . However , set OS Bipap may assume prominent role ability address disorder ; CPAP OSA portion inspiratory pressure assist ameliorate COPD piece . Thus far study conduct address whether OS may derive particular benefit Bipap , specifically , examine whether Bipap may diminish risk AECOPD , heart failure-related hospitalization .</detailed_description>
