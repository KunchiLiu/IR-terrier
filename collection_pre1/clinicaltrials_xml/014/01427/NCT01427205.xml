	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn addition OSI-906 cetuximab improve response . The safety drug also study . Objectives : Primary Objective ( ) : To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) among patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) treat combination cetuximab plus OSI-906 compare PFS among patient treat cetuximab plus placebo . Secondary Objective ( ) : - To assess safety toxicity treatment regimen . - To assess efficacy two treatment regimen term overall survival , response rate , disease control rate - To assess efficacy single agent OSI-906 follow cetuximab treatment term response rate disease control rate patient cross-over Arm B receive single-agent OSI-906 - To explore blood-based tissue biomarkers</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Cetuximab With Without OSI-906 Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein cancer cell , call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . OSI-906 design prevent slow growth cancer cell . A placebo drug . It look like study drug design treat disease illness . It design compare study drug learn study drug real effect . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - If Group 1 , receive cetuximab OSI-906 . - If Group 2 , receive cetuximab placebo . Neither study doctor know receive OSI-906 placebo . However , need safety , study doctor able find group . If disease get bad , study doctor find group offer chance take OSI-906 alone already receive . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 21 day . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , receive cetuximab vein . The first dose cetuximab give 120 minute . If well tolerate , additional infusion give 60 minute . You take OSI-906 placebo mouth 2 time every day 12 hour apart ( morning evening ) . You take OSI-906 placebo food glass ( 6 ½ ounce ) water . If forget take dose , take time 6 hour next dose . You must take miss dose next dose day dose next day . If vomit take tablet ( ) , dose replace tablet ( ) actually see count . You store study drug/placebo room temperature 77°F . In order help decrease risk infusion reaction , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) vein first dose cetuximab . If doctor think need , receive diphenhydramine every dose cetuximab . On Day 1 cycle , need return unused OSI-906 placebo empty bottle . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect list drug may take . On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 7 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You eat drink anything ( fast ) 8 hour blood draw . - If doctor think need able become pregnant , blood ( le 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , vital sign measure receive cetuximab . Every 6 week ( +/- 14 day ) : - You ECG . - You CT scan and/or MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue receive treatment long benefit . You take study early experience intolerable side effect , disease get bad , doctor think best interest , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drugs/placebo , end-of-treatment visit : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight - You ask side effect list drug may take . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , CT scan MRI scan check status disease . Long Term Follow-Up : About every 6 month , ( family member designees ) ask treatment may receive . This may phone , letter , email , clinic visit . This investigational study . OSI-906 FDA approve commercially available . At time , OSI-906 use research . Cetuximab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal head/ neck cancer . The combination OSI-906 cetuximab investigational . Up 66 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
