	<brief_summary>There grow epidemiological evidence consumption red meat associate great incidence Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) either white meat non-meat food . Research group show high saturate fat ( SF ) diet moderate red meat content selectively increase intermediate density lipoprotein ( IDL ) large low density lipoprotein ( LDLs ) , weakly associate CVD risk small LDLs . In contrast , investigator find similar intake SF , high beef consumption result preferential increase small medium LDL particles strongly relate CVD . To date , study directly compare lipoprotein effect red meat food source protein context high low saturate fat intake . The overall objective project test hypothesis effect SF lipoprotein marker CVD risk influence source dietary protein . The investigator hypothesize adverse effect SF plasma level LDL-cholesterol ( C ) , apolipoprotein B ( apo B ) , atherogenic LDL particle great diet high content red meat diet major protein white meat ( poultry ) non-meat source . The investigator propose clinical trial 180 healthy men woman randomize high SF low SF diet group , within group , consume diet equivalent amount protein red meat , white meat , non-meat source 4 wks random order . Specifically , investigator test whether : ( 1 ) With high SF , red meat diet , compare protein source , result high level LDL-C , apoB , small medium LDL , total/high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) C ; ( 2 ) With low SF , dietary protein source related measurement ; ( 3 ) With white meat non-meat protein diet , increase LDL-C high vs. low SF due primarily increase large LDL , whereas red meat additional increase small medium LDL result great increase plasma apoB total LDL particle number . Aim 4 test hypothesis increase small medium LDL high SF plus red meat relate increased activity hepatic lipase , key determinant small LDL production , increase large LDL induce high SF related suppression LDL receptor . The investigator also assess effect protein source saturate fat content marker insulin resistance , inflammation endothelial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinic Visits : Participants visit clinic total 11 time screen completion study . This include weekly visit nutritionist 9 visit require blood draw ( screen 2 consecutive visit dietary period ) . At visit , participant weigh , waist hip circumference measure blood pressure monitor . The total amount blood collect course study 455 mL . Screening visit ( SV : 1 hour ) : Recruiters initially determine eligibility review screen questionnaire telephone personal interview . If potential subject eligible interested , orientation package mail include write information study requirement . Interested individual pass pre-screening schedule screen blood draw visit determine final eligibility . At screen visit ( SV ) , participant give informed consent , review medical history register nurse , blood pressure , weight , height , waist hip circumference measure . Thirty ml blood drawn measurement plasma triglyceride ( TG ) , total-C , LDL-C , HDL-C , glucose thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) . Women childbearing potential give beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( b-hCG ) urine pregnancy test . Participants contact within 2 week notify eligibility . Nutritionist Visits ( Initial : 1 hr ) : Participants meet weekly nutritionist receive counsel include weight management diet review . At meeting , participant receive week 's worth frozen entree study food , well standardized menu check list . During washout period ( week 6-8 ; week 12-14 ) , subject continue refrain alcohol consume usual home diet 14 day . Post-diet Visits Requiring Blood Draws ( A visit : 1.5 hr , B visit : 2.5 hr ) : Participants visit clinic two separate day follow completion diet provide blood sample . Duplicate sample reduces biological variability , hence improves power study detect significant diet-induced change measurement . On penultimate day diet ( visit 1A , 2A , 3A , 4A ) fast blood draw ( 45 mL ) take plasma measurement ( TG , total-C , LDL-C , HDL-C , lipoprotein subfractions , glucose , insulin , apolipoproteins AI , AII , B , CIII , inflammatory marker ) . On last day dietary period ( visit 1B , 2B , 3B , 4B ) participant provide second fasting blood sample ( lipids lipoprotein ) . Lipoprotein lipase hepatic lipase activity also measure plasma ( 20mL ) collect 15 minute intravenous heparin ( 75 units/kg ) . Clinical Procedures : Clinical measurement : Blood pressure measure 3 time sit position last 2 value average . Anthropometric measurement include height , weight , waist hip circumference , % body fat bioimpedance ( Tanita scale ) . Waist circumference measure two time iliac crest hip circumference measure wide point hip . Standard Blood sampling : Using standard blood collection procedure , blood sample collect participant 12-14 hour fast . The blood collect tube contain follow preservative solution : 3.0 gm EDTA ( dipotassium ) , 1.7 mg P-Pack , 0.15 gm gentamycin sulfate , 0.15 gm chloramphenicol , 5.96 ml aprotinin ( Sigma A-6279 ) , 0.30 gm sodium azide dilute 20mls doubly deionized water . Plasma separate immediate centrifugation 4Â°C . Lipid lipoprotein measurement perform aliquot plasma frozen future analysis . Post-heparin Blood Sampling : A blood sample ( 20ml ) drawn 15 minute intravenous administration heparin bolus ( 75 U/kg , see Risk section justification ) analysis plasma lipase activity . Prior administration , participant interview family history clot disorder personal contraindication include use anticoagulant , history bleed bruise abnormality disease , allergy , recent dental work . Following administration , participant remain clinic 2 hour observation . They also provide information sheet regard heparin procedure . Measurement endothelial function : Endothelial function assess fast state finger reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry ( RH-PAT , Endo-Pat2000 , Itamar Medical , Israel ) express RH-PAT index . Participants rest supine position quiet , temperature-controlled room 30 min . prior PAT measurement abstain caffeine 6 hour water 2 hour prior test , per manufacturer 's guideline .</detailed_description>
