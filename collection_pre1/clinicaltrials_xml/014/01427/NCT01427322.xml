	<detailed_description>Lapatinib orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor ERBB1 ERBB2 ( HER2 ) . It currently indicate use patient HER2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer . Serum increase TGFα growth potentiate effect distant site metastatic disease . Palliative irradiation paradoxically may promote distant tumor growth ; block shed TGFα irradiated tumor may prevent effect improve therapeutic index radiation therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History stage IV epithelialderived cancer require palliative radiation . Patients sarcoma , lymphoma , myeloma neuroendocrin cancer eligible . Evidence metastatic disease Recommendation patient 's radiation oncologist receive palliative external beam radiation metastases minimum fraction size 3 Gy . Age 18 year old Patients may undergoing concurrent therapy GNRH agonist combine androgen blockade antiestrogen hormonal therapy breast cancer , standard care advanced prostate breast cancer respectively . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Any contraindication lapatinib treatment . Prior radiation therapy within 30 day start planned course treatment . Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within 42 week plan first dose radiation . Persistent grade 2 great nonhematologic toxicity ( neuropathy ) cytotoxic chemotherapy regardless interval since last dose . Persistent grade 3 great hematologic toxicity ( lymphopenia ) reglardless interval since last dose . Prior administration ERBB1 ERK1/2 inhibitor within 30 day start planned course treatment . Patients medical necessity continue active therapy CYP3A4 strong inhibitor inducer . The concomitant use strong CYP3A4 inhibitor avoid ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , indinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , voriconazole , aprepitant ) . Grapefruit may also increase plasma concentration lapatinib avoid . Once strong inhibitor inducer discontinue , washout period approximately 1 week allow lapatinib administration . If patient unable discontinue medication , eligible enrollment . Concurrent administration investigational agent . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active hepatic biliary disease ChildPugh class B C , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement would interfere accomplish study objective . Pregnant nursing . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use medically accept form birth control duration study participation . Men must agree use medically accept form birth control 4 month follow completion study treatment .</criteria>
