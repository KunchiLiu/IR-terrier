	<brief_title>Maternal Singing During Kangaroo Care Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal sing preterm infant Kangaroo Care intervention , beneficial ? Protocol Maternal voice predominant source multimodal stimulation develop fetus largely lose preterm infant amidst unfiltered level auditory stimuli neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . These elevated level auditory stimulation NICU interfere infant 's sleep negative effect vital sign oxygen saturation . Common source sound preterm infant derive routine incubator noise , monitoring alarm , speech sound healthcare team , would typically encounter life uterus continued term . In midst additional sound , preterm infant lose significant contact auditory stimulus would typically expose full-term birth ( mother ' voice ) . Skin skin contact care ( Kangaroo care ) find produce cardiorespiratory stability , decrease apneic periodic breathing , improve sleep pattern weight gain preterm infant . This technique also show help mother preterm infant develop strengthen self-confidence attachment behavior , lead reduced stress response . Live music show beneficial effect psychophysiological response mother preterm infant stay NICU . Aim : To evaluate combined influence live maternal singing kangaroo care ( KC ) maternal anxiety stable preterm infant ' response . Participants Inclusion criterion clinically stable infant postmenstrual age &lt; 37 week normal hearing confirm measurement distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAE ) . Exclusion criterion observe hyperresponsiveness live music congenital anomaly mainly affect hear medication intake ( phenobarbital , furosemide , gentamycin ) might interfere reaction musical stimulus brain anomaly associate neurological disorder ( grade 3-4 intraventricular hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia ) . Maternal inclusion criterion ability hear literary ability read answer anxiety questionnaire Maternal exclusion criterion sign medical history postpartum depression . Procedure A within-subject , crossover , repeat design use participant act control . Before start research , mother get professional guidance sing lullaby offspring , music therapist ( E.G ) . The mother sit infant ' bedside child place kangaroo position skin-to-skin contact mother . Each therapy session start 30 minute feed get relaxed infant test intervention disturbance hunger . As recommended infant receive either KC alone 30 minute KC combine maternal singing 30 minute . According randomization schedule , therapy perform afternoon finish medical nursing round , alternate order 3 5 day apart allow washout period , include music . Monitor alarm silence door close . Objective Sound Measurements Music background sound level check 10 cm infant 's ear sound analyzer decibel scale filter ( 407790 Octave Band Sound Analyzer , type 2 Integrating Sound Level Meter Decibel-A Scale Filter , respectively ; Extech Instruments , Melrose , MA , USA ) . Infant Maternal Measures For accuracy , neonatal maternal heart rate , oxygen saturation level , respiratory rate record continuously document every 2 minute session . A 7-point scale ass infant ' behavioral state ( deep sleep , light sleep , drowsy , quiet awake alert , actively awake aroused highly arouse , upset , cry , prolonged respiratory pause &gt; 8 second ) self-report questionnaire comprise 20 descriptive statement measure maternal anxiety symptom ( state-trait anxiety inventory [ STAI ] scale use begin end intervention . Higher score indicate great anxiety , possible score 20 80 point . Additional maternal measure age , ethnicity ( Arab/Jews ) , education ( 8 year , elementary school ; 8-12 year , high school ; &gt; 13 year , college/university degree ) , affinity music ( 5-point scale : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 hour , measure length time spend day listen music ) . Data record single physician remain bedside throughout session . Data analyze blinded fashion another researcher unaware treatment allocation . Power Analysis : To achieve power 0.8 Î± = 0.05 one-tailed medium effect size 0.610 medium correlation ( r = 0.50 ) among two repeat measure use F-test , sample size 30 mother-infant dyad need .</detailed_description>
