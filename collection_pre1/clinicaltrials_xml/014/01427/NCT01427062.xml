	<brief_summary>Falling complex disabling feature patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Previous study suggest falls patient PD related postural instability characterize deficit anticipatory postural adjustment ( APA ) postural orientation walk stand inadequate postural response perturbation . The present study develop innovative balance treatment focus anticipatory compensatory postural control examine effect enhance balance gait performance decrease fall rate people PD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Innovative Balance Training Programme Enhancing Postural Control Reducing Falls Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Forty-two eligible subject PD randomly allocate balance focus anticipatory compensatory postural control ( EXP ) control ( CON ) group strength-focused training , 26 subject group . Methods : Subjects EXP group train speed amplitude anticipatory postural adjustment step walk postural response perturbation walk . Subjects In CON group train improve strength lower limb muscle . Treatment period group last 12 week , consist 4-week laboratory-based training ( phase 1 ) , 4-week home-based exercise ( phase 2 ) final 4-week laboratory-based training ( phase 3 ) . Outcome measure include reaction time ( RT ) , movement velocity ( MV ) endpoint excursion ( EPE ) limit-of-stability test , one-leg-stance ( OLS ) time , gait velocity , stride length ( SL ) , cadence , fall rate . All test conduct 6 time interval include baseline , train phase , 3-month follow-up 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
