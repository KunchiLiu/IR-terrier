	<detailed_description>Cords band tissue present axilla follow breast cancer surgery may extend across antecubital fossa forearm . Cords often painful patient limit shoulder range motion.The propose study design involve recruitment patient enrol Partners Protocol # 2008P000540 , prospective analysis symptom , functionality quality life questionnaire evaluate lymphedema patient follow treatment breast cancer . This protocol recruit newly diagnose breast cancer patient prior treatment intervention . Subjects require undergo volumetric arm measurement complete Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment Breast Cancer Questionnaire ( LEFT-BC ) allow evaluation change functionality , upper extremity utilization ( fear associate avoidance ) , quality life . Throughout treatment patient screen treatment event : surgery , chemotherapy radiation . Following conclusion treatment breast cancer , patient measure least 2 time per year ( every 4-7 month ) . If study visit patient note cord symptom , research staff administer questionnaire alert . At point , notify designate medical provider perform physical examination area confirm presence cording . Once presence cord verify , patient provide opportunity enroll propose trial . Due current limit knowledge nature condition , patient arm axilla image within 7 day physical exam confirmation .
