	<brief_summary>Adaptive dose paint appear increase chance cure minimize radiation-induced toxicity intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) primary head neck cancer . This could also importance IMRT recurrent second primary head neck cancer previously irradiate territory . This trial investigate feasibility continuous adaptive 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography-voxel ( [ 18F ] FDG-PET-voxel ) intensity-based IMRT reirradiation patient recurrent second primary head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
