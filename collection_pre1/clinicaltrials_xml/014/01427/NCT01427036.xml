	<detailed_description>Fractures trochanter elderly terrible prognosis vital functional . It certainly possible reduce medical economic impact disease reduce surgical trauma , mean minimally invasive osteosynthesis material adapt approach . This minimally invasive approach , however , guarantee result least equal standard approach . The goal technique , easily transmit , use percutaneous approach , may convert conventional surgery case difficulty , implant appropriate trochanteric fracture . With mind , dynamic hip screw MISS® ( Minimally Invasive Screw System ) develop already demonstrate effectiveness term anatomical result . It effective PHS® hip screw design standard approach . The two implant plate screw differ system fix screw plate allow minimal invasive approach . The main objective study show use dynamic hip screw MISS associate low morbidity ( term bleed ) comparison material PHS standard ( Pertrochanteric Hip Screw ) implant standard approach . The secondary objective : - Check quality reduction stability osteosynthesis MISS equivalent PHS . - Assessing economic impact duration use operating room length hospitalization The study randomize trial multicenter parallel group collection blind endpoint : PROBE Study ( Prospective Randomized Blinded Endpoint ) , compare two technique : minimally invasive approach versus standard approach , Apart incision , system fix screw plate , period operation identical . Operation do table fracture X-rays control C arm . Associated therapy identical group follow protocol department . Number patient : 54 group = 108 patient Duration research Duration inclusion period : 21 month Duration participation patient : three month Total duration study : 24 month Expected effect : For patient : intervention well support , postoperative simple , shorten length stay faster rehabilitation . For hospital : intervention shorter simpler , low occupation time block , decrease average length stay . For society : reduce cost care patient society</detailed_description>
