	<brief_summary>While number assist reproduction cycle increase worldwide , introduction actual technological improvement ability quickly non-invasively identify best embryo transfer still represent critical goal reproductive medicine . Indeed , embryo assessment currently perform analysis morphology cleavage rate . Recent study seek identify correlation qualitative-quantitative profile small molecule metabolic interest outcome embryo transfer . Some molecule seem best suit purpose , include glucose , lactate , pyruvate amino acid level . Approaches rely optical non-optical spectroscopy propose non-invasively monitor embryo culture medium . However , non-invasive approach offer indirect strategy monitor embryo turn-around solution bypass limit detection analytical technique . In paper investigator pave way direct assessment embryos mass spectrometry-based analysis blastocoele fluid , withdrawn blastocoele cavity prior cryostorage blastocyst . The investigator show possible detect already document metabolite interest right heart blastocyst , without disrupt workflow classic laboratory pipeline .</brief_summary>
