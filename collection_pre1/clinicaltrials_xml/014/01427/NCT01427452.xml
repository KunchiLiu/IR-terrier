	<brief_summary>Live donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT ) important outcome recipient superior decease donor transplantation , yield significant cost saving healthcare system overall . Despite effort past decade enhance understand short- long-term outcome live kidney donation , clear investigator knowledge area ( e.g. , surgical medical complication ) others ( e.g. , psychological outcome , financial impact ) . While transplant community change federal regulation bring attention need systematic study live donor outcome , remain paucity scientifically rigorous multisite , prospective outcome study . The long-term goal research program characterize short- long-term surgical , medical , functional , psychological , financial outcome live kidney donation . The objective study establish multisite prospective cohort live kidney donor , recipient , healthy comparison group . This cohort use examine three primary aim : ( 1 ) ass donor outcome ( surgical , medical , functional , psychological , financial ) 2-year period initially , intention examine outcome extended time period subsequent year ; ( 2 ) identify donor , recipient , center variable predictive donor outcome ; ( 3 ) identify disparity donor outcomes predictor . To accomplish aim , six kidney transplant program , represent six state ( Massachusetts , Maine , Rhode Island , New York , Iowa , Arizona ) experience expertise care live donor transplant recipient , participate study . Donors , recipient , healthy control complete comprehensive assessment baseline ( pre-surgery ) 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month post-donation . This study extend investigator considerable preliminary work simultaneously examine outcome importance donor , recipient , healthcare provider , policymakers . The rationale research , outcomes predictor know , investigator develop refine educational strategy inform consent process live donor intend recipient , well provide systematic data inform policy discussion clinical care practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation extend improve life adult end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Live donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT ) many advantage decease donor transplantation recipient , include short dialysis exposure , immediate graft function , low perioperative morbidity mortality , good long-term graft patient survival . Also , yield significant cost saving healthcare system overall . These relative advantage advance field ( e.g. , laparoscopic technique , pair kidney exchange ) lead transplant candidate program proactively embrace LDKT primary treatment option . Living kidney donor account 40 % kidney transplant perform United States past 10 year , 90,000 adult undergone live donor nephrectomy United States last 20 year . Worldwide large-scale study examine short- long-term outcome live kidney donation , many limited retrospective , cross-sectional , and/or single-center design appropriate control group . Despite effort enhance understand donor outcome , clear knowledge area ( e.g. , surgical short-term medical complication ) others ( e.g. , long-term medical complication , psychological outcome , financial impact ) . The relative paucity multisite , prospective outcome study concern , especially consider expand donor eligibility criterion use transplant program today . Over past decade , criterion acceptance live donor candidate change : donor candidate would consider 15 year ago ( e.g. , hypertension , obesity , prior relationship recipient ) readily evaluate many program . Recently , transplant community change federal regulation bring attention need systematic study live donor outcome . While report outcomes 2-yr period mandate Organ Procurement Transplantation Network ( OPTN ) United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) , transplant program systematically collect donor outcome data . The lack data important problem , without , continue considerable variability inform consent process live donor recipient , well limited data inform clinical practice policy development . This study directly address several recommendation make U.S. Department Health Human Services ' Advisory Committee Organ Transplantation . A . Design Overview This six center , prospective observational cohort study . A total 280 live kidney donor , 280 LDKT recipient , 160 healthy comparison subject meet eligibility criterion enrol . Participants complete assessment protocol 5 time point : prior surgery ( Baseline , T1 ) , 1 month surgery ( T2 ) , 6 month surgery ( T3 ) , 12 month surgery ( T4 ) , 24 month surgery ( T5 ) . The rationale selecting time point correspond assessment interval currently require OPTN/UNOS live donor follow-up , select Living Donation Committee appropriate time point gather short- long-term follow-up data . B . Study Participants A total 280 live kidney donor , 280 LDKT recipient , 160 healthy comparison subject meet eligibility criterion enrol . We enroll English Spanish speaking participant study . All questionnaire outcomes translate Spanish use conventional translational procedure ensure interviewer BIDMC fluent Spanish . It important emphasize questionnaire use study validate Spanish Hispanic patient . While important limitation , feel limitation outweigh potential benefit include primarily Spanish-speaking participant study . The primary focus study assess donor outcome . The rationale include recipient examine role recipient factor play predict donor outcomes . There preliminary evidence aspect recipient 's functioning ( e.g. , graft survival , QOL ) associate certain functional psychological outcome live donors.7,8,88 The inclusion transplant recipient study permit examination association time allow u include recipient variable heretofore neglect ( e.g. , perception donor-recipient relationship ) . Also , recruit healthy , non-donor comparison group . A healthy comparison group allow u address question , `` What I donate kidney ? '' - question often consider donor . These adult complete one part donor evaluation , proceed various reason ( although none medical ) . C. Participant Recruitment Retention The first participant enrol study September 2011 . Recruitment time schedule 24 month . The last study assessment , therefore , complete August 2015 . Target recruitment site 47 donor-recipient pair 27 healthy comparison . Importantly , recruit living donor study regardless recipient 's participation status . Even absence recipient 's participation , obtain valuable data donor outcome . However , first-and-foremost study evaluate donor outcome , donor consent participate study , approach recipient study participation . Non-directed donor recruit study . If 's anonymous donation , recipient approach study . In case , donor enrol . If non-directed donor establish relationship ( albeit new one ) intend recipient , attempt enroll donor recipient study , like donor-recipient pair . Donors participate paired kidney donation program ( KPD ) recruit study . In instance , enroll KPD donor intend recipient ( i.e. , recipient incompatible , recipient specific kidney ) . For transplant recipient enrol study , determine s/he potential donor initially screen evaluated progress donation surgery . This initial screen evaluation may include initial health history , ABO testing , and/or preliminary test . To qualify control subject , non-donor may may complete entire evaluation , none study perform excluded donation . If enrol donor one potential health control subject , attempt recruit study .</detailed_description>
