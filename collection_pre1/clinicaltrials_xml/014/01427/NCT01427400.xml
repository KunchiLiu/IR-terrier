	<brief_summary>Breast reconstruction common procedure 86,000 breast reconstruction procedure perform United States 2009 . This 1.5-fold increase since 2007 . Of breast reconstruction , 65 % use tissue expander/implant technique . Although satisfactory result achieve single-stage technique , two-stage approach consider reliable , allow precise position inframammary fold opportune time perform capsulotomy increase breast skin flap release soft tissue . The placement tissue expander implant chest muscle think minimize incidence capsular contracture , expander exposure , addition , produce acceptable aesthetic result . However , discomfort often associated submuscular placement tissue expander implant , specifically expansion phase . Patients undergo immediate reconstruction use submuscular implant show high analgesic requirement higher pain score post-operatively , compare non-reconstructed patient . An uncomfortable reconstruction lead under-filling expander , long expansion process , abandonment reconstruction , compromise quality life . The use Botulinum Toxin A ( Botox ) injection chest muscle time surgery may help ease discomfort often associated procedure . The investigator propose prospective double-blind randomize placebo-controlled trial patient undergoing tissue expander/implant reconstruction . The information gather analysis provide great understanding effect Botox set two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction , goal improve patient satisfaction quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , level C evidence efficacy Botox treatment postoperative pain muscle spasms breast reconstruction patient . Additional high-level evidence necessary justify use Botox breast cancer patient , potentially improve reconstructive process patient improve quality life . Additionally , study date evaluate patient satisfaction QOL setting . The investigator evaluate patient satisfaction QOL use Breast-QÂ© different time period two-stage tissue expander/implant reconstruction . Previous study demonstrate reduction pain Botox use tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction , however , study blind may introduce bias . Additionally , timely reconstruction important patient , decrease pain may result short fill interval increase total amount volume tissue expander . The investigator therefore document amount expansion patient tolerate follow-up visit total volume expand , compare data Botox group group assign placebo .</detailed_description>
