	<brief_summary>Hypertension major grow public health concern . Chronic elevation sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) activity identify major contributor complex pathophysiology ( essential ) hypertension . The renal sympathetic nerve play major role elevation SNS activity . Therapeutic renal denervation ( RD ) , deliberate disruption nerve connect kidneys central nervous system , show effective mean modulate elevated SNS activity - reduce sympathetic modulation renal function ( renin release , sodium excretion renal blood flow ) remove renal afferent sympathetic contribution central blood pressure elevation . This current study observational exploratory study . The main objective study learn effect RD . We wish quantify effect RD various biological variable . Those variable study four set investigation : radiological set , laboratorial set , set blood pressure measurement set investigation vascular laboratory . The radiological set consist image heart kidney function ( renal perfusion ) structure ( renal artery ) , laboratorial set serum urine test , 24 h- home- office- blood pressure measurement take finally set vascular test contain investigation pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) . The data likely help u define future study , describe mode action effect RD various organ system detail , finally define detail type hypertensive patient especially likely benefit procedure . Hypothesis : - We hypothesize LV mass decrease RD . Because patient severe hypertension , likely substantial percentage increase LV mass . - We hypothesize renal perfusion renal oxygenation increase RD . - We hypothesize complication related device procedure . - We hypothesize renal denervation beneficial effect insulin resistance - We hypothesize renal denervation decrease blood pressure ( office 24-hour-measurements ) - We hypothesize RD beneficial effect PWV HRV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Renal Denervation Biological Variables</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study : investigation change leave ventricular mass ( LV mass ) RD use MRI , renal perfusion renal oxygenation RD use dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE MRI ) blood oxygenation level dependent MRI ( BOLD MRI ) , evaluation safety RD , term structural change renal artery kidney use Magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) . Secondly evaluation change various biological function assess analysis blood and/or urine sample . Thirdly quantification change blood pressure . Finally change pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) . Study design : Observational exploratory-study . Study population : Adults systolic BP ≥160 mmHg ( ≥150 mmHg type 2 diabetic ) stable drug regimen include 3 antihypertensive medication , include diuretic , inability follow stable drug regimen due unacceptable side-effects antihypertensive medication . Main study parameters/endpoints : The effect RD : radiological variable : leave ventricular wall mass , renal perfusion , renal oxygenation anatomy renal artery . Secondly effect RD biological variable assess analysis blood and/or urine sample . Thirdly change blood pressure . Finally change PWV HRV RD . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk associate test procedure perform clinical study limit . There known risk associate MRI appropriate safety guideline follow . Based experience form previous study , expect potential risk regard cessation anti-hypertensives .</detailed_description>
