	<brief_summary>The optimisation drug absorption skin great value modern therapy.Phonophoresis use therapeutic ultrasound increase percutaneous drug absorption . However , study compare pulse continuous mode therapeutic ultrasound.This study compare two mode investigate effect lidocaine phonophoresis sensory blockade . Ninety-three healthy volunteer , assign random one three ultrasound group : pulse ( ultrasound+lidocaine ) , continuous ( ultrasound+lidocaine ) control ( sham ultrasound+lidocaine ) . Lidocaine administer transdermally use transducer.Two point discrimination , touch maximum pain threshold assess intervention group . Pulsed ultrasound topical lidocaine gel induce great anaesthetic effect compare continuous ultrasound topical lidocaine gel lidocaine application alone . The mechanical property pulse ultrasound appear responsible great drug penetration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Phonophoresis Lidocaine Gel Its Effect Sensory Blockage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lidocaine common local anaesthetic drug use topically relieve pain , itch burning , also minor surgery.However , application via conductive method , confine surface anaesthesia seem possible deep transmission local drug massage , without injection systematic administration.On hand , injection lidocaine lead tissue injury pain , use advise child . Phonophoresis one common procedure reduce problem . Therefore , main aim study compare two mode therapeutic ultrasound assess effect lidocaine gel phonophoresis percutaneous absorption sensory blockade .</detailed_description>
