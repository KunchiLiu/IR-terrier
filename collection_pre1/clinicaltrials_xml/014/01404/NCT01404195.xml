	<brief_summary>1 . RATIONALE The unique characteristic study lie attempt reverse functional impairment experience sarcopenic patient hip fracture use nutritional intervention . What make study different prior study conduct hospital setting , unlike prior study , conduct community set . The association muscle mass strength , inflammatory index , functional impairment versus dependence fragility also measure . 2 . HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis study nutritional intervention enrich metabolite essential amino acid ( beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate ) effective treat sarcopenia elderly patient hip fracture improve functional level . 3 . OBJECTIVES Primary objective ass functional improvement nutritional intervention sarcopenic patient hip fracture , measure use Barthel index . Secondary objective include : 1 ) show relationship metabolic inflammatory index sarcopenia ; 2 ) show sarcopenia treatment influence risk fall ; 3 ) show muscle mass improvement ; 4 ) show increased strength ; 5 ) ass mortality morbidity . 4 . EXPECTED RESULTS The investigator expect find supplemented group experience throughout study period significant improvement functional status ( Barthel index ) , increase muscle mass , reduction fat mass . An increased strength reduction associate complication ( fall ) also expect . The investigator hope able show reduction inflammatory index insulin resistance . To conclude , improve muscle strength mass investigator expect find reduction disability dependence population group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperprotein Nutritional Intervention Elderly Patients With Hip Fracture Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Sarcopenia loss muscle mass function associate age . Rosemberg first speak sarcopenia 1989 . A progressive loss muscle mass occur approximately 40 year age . This loss estimate 8 % decade age 70 year , loss increase 15 % decade . Healthcare cost attributable sarcopenia United States ( US ) 2000 estimate 18.5 billion dollar . It would natural assume direct relationship muscle mass strength , loss muscle mass main mechanism loss strength . Proximal femur ( hip ) fracture substantial cause morbidity mortality elderly . One-year mortality hip fracture range 12 % 37 % , 11 % incidence first month . Twenty-five percent elderly patient hip fracture require institutionalization , least temporary , 40 % fully recover pre-fracture functional status . Nutritional therapy , particularly beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) , metabolite essential amino acid , leucine , arouse great expectation . All prior study nutritional supplementation HMB show improved muscle metabolism , decrease protein degradation , significant increase fat-free mass young elderly people .</detailed_description>
