	<brief_summary>The routine use glycoprotein ( Gp ) IIb-IIIa inhibitor abciximab recommend current ACC/AHA guideline ( Class IIb , level evidence A ) . This may partly due potential increase bleeding . Compared bolus injection follow continuous infusion Gp IIb-IIIa inhibitor , single bolus administration propose decrease bleed complication maintain decrease ischemic event . It also report direct intracoronary injection abciximab might superior intravenous injection regard myocardial perfusion . Aspiration thrombectomy regard important adjunctive therapy treatment acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( IIa , level evidence B ) . We hypothesize combination intracoronary abciximab bolus injection aspiration thrombectomy might enhance adequate myocardial perfusion patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction . We determine whether combination intracoronary abciximab injection aspiration thrombectomy superior treatment term myocardial perfusion index microcirculatory resistance cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .</brief_summary>
