	<brief_summary>This multicenter , non-randomized , single agent , Phase II study AUY922 patient refractory Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST ) . The primary endpoint study determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient GIST receive AUY922 intravenously ( IV ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 21-day treatment cycle restaging 6 12 week every 9 week thereafter . Patients may continue treatment evidence disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY922 Treatment Patients With Refractory Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) common sarcoma arise gastrointestinal tract . Sunitinib ( Pfizer ) imatinib ( Novartis ) FDA-approved treatment patient GIST . However , patient advance refractory GIST resistant agent eventually experience disease progression death . Heat shock protein-90 ( Hsp90 ) substance find various malignancy encourage tumor cell grow survive . As inhibitor Hsp90 , AUY922 may decrease growth tumor cell resistant prior therapy . This study investigate AUY922 monotherapy treatment patient either progress , resistant , imatinib sunitinib .</detailed_description>

For pt receive small molecule target therapy , study treatment may begin ≥21 day last dose ≥5 half live previous treatment , whichever short . The patient must recover come new chronic stable baseline treatmentrelated toxicity . 2 . Use nonapproved investigational agent ≤30 day administration first dose study drug . Pts may receive investigational anticancer treatment participate study . 3 . Uncontrolled brain mets . Pts treat brain mets ( resection radiotherapy ) eligible brain mets respond treatment document CT MRI scan obtain ≥2 wks completion RT , neurologic symptoms absent , steroid discontinue . 4 . Treatment therapeutic dos coumadintype anticoagulant ( maximum daily dose 1 mg allow port line patency permit ) . 5 . Impaired cardiac function one following : History ( family history ) prolong QT syndrome . Mean QTc ≥450 msec baseline ECG . History clinically manifest IHD ≤6 mo prior study start . History heart failure history leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction ( LVEF ≤45 % ) MUGA ECHO . Clinically significant ECG abnormality include 1 following : left bundle branch block , right bundle branch block leave anterior hemiblock . ST segment elevation depression &gt; 1 mm , 2nd ( Mobitz II ) 3rd degree AV block . History presence AFib , atrial flutter ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes . Other clinically significant heart disease . Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) . Currently receive treatment medication relative risk prolong QTcF interval induce Torsades de Pointes switch alternative drug discontinue prior commence AUY922 . Obligate use cardiac pacemaker . 6 .
