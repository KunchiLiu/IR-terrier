	<brief_summary>Brief Summary The purpose study well characterize retina optic nerve newborn use spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( s-oct ) . This new technology provide detailed cross-section picture cellular layer retina 3-dimensional picture optic nerve head fovea ( center retina provide accurate vision ) . These image use doctor 5 year help diagnose treat adult eye disease , macular degeneration , diabetic retinopathy , retinal detachment , melanoma . But , never study newborn . In newborn , would potentially help diagnosis glaucoma , optic nerve hypoplasia , foveal hypoplasia , colobomata among many disorder . Prior diagnose disorder , necessary establish normal value . It purpose investigation study retina optic nerve neonate establish normal value . After parent normal newborn provide write consent , baby take Eye Clinic instrument locate . The baby swaddle one blanket need . The infant hold front instrument nurse . The technician move lens instrument 2 4 inch baby 's eye . The mild light instrument enter eye second obtain desired image . The image capture immobile eye within 5 second . If baby fussy , may give drop sugar ( sucrose ) solution pacifier calm . Although image usually secure normal pupil , pupil find small , two drop Cyclomydril place eye dilation . This eye drop use everyday Eye Clinic nursery dilate pupil baby . The dilation last 6 10 hour . After test , baby return nursery discharge home intend Neonatology Division . There minimal risk associate investigation . The instrument non-invasive touch eye . The baby swaddle held nurse prevent contact machine . The eye drop use need dilation use baby Harbor 30 year . It find safe . The fact study term ( premature baby ) apply two drop need minimize risk eye drop . An ethical issue consider study provide important information undoubtedly help baby future , probably benefit baby study . However , baby undetected retinal optic nerve problem , study may reveal .</brief_summary>
