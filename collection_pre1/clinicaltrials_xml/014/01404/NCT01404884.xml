	<brief_summary>This clinical study plan evaluate safety effectiveness SUPRACR presbyopic excimer laser treatment algorithm myopic eye develop apply cornea human eye single center . The developed software algorithm use subjective refraction eye create treatment distance vision correction . This part treatment show difference regular aspheric LASIK treatment myopic case . In addition treatment distance vision additional central ablation component add address near vision . The study design apply single center unilateral eye safety effectiveness study SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm myopia 3 month postoperative follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Presbyopia age-related progressive decrease ability bring near object clear focus . It attribute change accommodative apparatus visual system include ciliary muscle crystalline lens . Current Presbyopia management include bifocal multifocal correction spectacle contact lens provide good focus range object distance . Current LASIK refractive surgery algorithm use Excimer laser safe , effective , precise way treat ametropia eye regular cornea . The LASIK procedure use microkeratome create lamellar resection cornea intend depth range 90 160 micron . The microkeratome design maintain `` hinge '' tissue flap corneal epithelium superficial stroma lift expose deep stromal tissue remain attach cornea . The ablative energy excimer laser apply directly expose corneal stroma remove require amount tissue give refractive error . The amount corneal tissue remove determined magnitude refractive correction treatment area ( optic zone ) . Once laser ablation complete , flap reposition residual stromal bed . The presbyopic treatment consist standard aspheric treatment distance vision call SUPRACOR addition correct near vision . The SUPRACOR addition provide multifocal ablation central near addition aberration control transition zone towards periphery , thereby allow good focus range object distance . This approach show good near visual performance hyperopic eye ( see also section 2.1 ) . The SUPRACOR presbyopic treatment algorithm subject study specifically develop prospectively generate treatment file Technolas 217z100 laser provide Presbyopia correction among eye primary myopia myopic astigmatism ( distance correction ) .</detailed_description>
