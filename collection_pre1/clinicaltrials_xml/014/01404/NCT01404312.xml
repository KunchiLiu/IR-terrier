	<brief_summary>HIV-infected people increase risk develop active tuberculosis ( TB ) . The standard course treatment TB 6 9 month isoniazid ( INH ) . A short course treatment may effective potentially increase treatment adherence . This study compare safety effectiveness 4-week regimen rifapentine ( RPT ) plus INH versus standard 9-month regimen INH HIV-infected people risk develop active TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Short-Course Rifapentine/Isoniazid Prevention Active Tuberculosis HIV-Infected Individuals With Latent Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 2009 9.4 million new case TB , 1.68 million people die result TB . Among new TB case , 1.1 million occurred people HIV-coinfected , 35 % TB death among HIV-coinfected individual . In Africa , TB lead AIDS-related opportunistic infection . Latent TB infection occur people infected bacteria cause TB , symptom TB infection . Latent TB develop active TB , HIV-infected people increase risk progress latent TB active TB . INH medication prescribe people latent TB help prevent active TB developing . The standard INH treatment regimen 6 9 month ; short treatment regimen may prove effective may improve adherence . The purpose study compare safety effectiveness 4-week daily regimen RPT plus INH standard 9-month daily INH regimen TB prevention HIV-infected individual . This study enroll HIV-infected people evidence active TB high risk develop active TB . Participants randomly assign receive RPT INH day 4 week INH day 9 month . All participant receive pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) dose INH help prevent possible side effect . Study visit occur baseline Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 36 . At select study visit , participant undergo physical exam , clinical assessment , blood collection , chest radiograph chest compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( need ) . Some participant blood store future test . Follow-up study visit occur every 12 week start Week 48 continue 3 year last participant enrol .</detailed_description>
