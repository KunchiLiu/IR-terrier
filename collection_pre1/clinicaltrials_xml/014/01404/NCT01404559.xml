	<brief_summary>Many service member suffer major limb amputation ( ) active duty seek return active duty . The purpose study determine biomechanic and/or bioenergtic difference exist popular multi-function prosthetic foot would facilitate return duty soldier amputation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measures Gait Efficiency Three Multi-Axial , Vertical Shock Energy Storing-Return Prosthetic Feet During Simple &amp; Complex Mobility Activities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims - Compare effectiveness popular prosthesis improve performance physically demand task environment . - Compare amputee performance group high-functioning non-amputees determine performance difference group . Hypotheses : Prosthetic foot shock absorb torsional feature perform good field activity . Prosthetic foot high energy return low mass perform well treadmill run . Non-amputee control demonstrate superior performance outcome field laboratory environment compare amputee subject . Relevance : This study potential quantify difference highly mobile amputee non-amputees . Additionally , provide objective measure different prosthesis may enhance mobility soldier amputation . The study compare laboratory field measure indicate condition increase efficiency prosthesis rapidly change mobility demand . This potential permit retention already trained soldier .</detailed_description>
