	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous study show computer-based device simulate everyday task helpful evaluation rehabilitation people stroke . Researchers interested study whether similar device use evaluate treat individual traumatic brain injury , determine device develop help rehabilitation future . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness computer-based simulation compare actual performance action individual traumatic brain injury . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age non-penetrating mild moderate traumatic head injury within past year experience playing computer game . Design : - Participants screen physical neurological examination medical history . - Participants complete questionnaire interview mood feeling , stress level , quality life , well function work home . Participants also test memory , attention , thinking , reason . Some questionnaire test complete writing , orally , computer . - Participants movement coordination test involve simple task put pegs pegboard , use key , lift different object , fold thing . - Participants duplicate movement coordination test use computer program simulate task cursor computer screen . Participants four separate simulate task ( arrange letter hit nail hammer ) three time . - The full visit take 4 hour , followup visit require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Devices That Involve Sense Touch Subjects With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults suffer traumatic brain injury people wide variety sign symptom . These often include problem motor plan learning , memory , cognitive performance behavior . The physical finding self report symptoms heterogeneous , always correlate anatomic finding . Evaluation measurement function population , treatment functional deficit develop treatment specifically target toward functional recovery . Additionally , evaluation treatment usually rely heavily labor intensive intervention . This study ass feasibility use haptic device interface user via touch use force feedback subject TBI . Haptic device similar joystick . The specific haptic device use project stylus , shape like pen subject navigates virtual space move cursor computer screen . The project aim obtain pilot data relation individual TBI performs measure engagement interaction haptic , programmed simulate functional activity cognitive task , whether haptic device reliably use data capture . Study Population Seventy adult subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating TBI enrol . Subjects need least 1 year date initial brain injury . Subjects recruit NIH , affiliate hospitals/clinics , community . Design This prospective cohort study subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating traumatic brain injury . Subjects recruit assessed National Institutes Health . Data share stored NIH . Subjects stratify accord finding cohort comparison . Subjects treat experimental therapy part research study . The role multimodal visuo-sensory motor input learn use haptic device explore project . Virtual reality apply evaluation treatment person TBI . The application simulate environment help engage patient therapeutic activity also provide real life situation call integration sensory , cognitive motor activity Haptic robotic device , provide sensory force input assist human movement , use help neurorecovery . Each subject one test session follow-up appointment . The haptic session design take 1 hour . However , may take long complete battery test . It may take four hour complete NIH process admission , history physical , haptic session . Outcome Measures Performance haptic task assess time completion , distance trajectory frequency repeat trajectory .</detailed_description>
