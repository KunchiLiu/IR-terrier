	<brief_summary>In study , investigator hope study number variable investigator believe may help u predict people respond good medication others . Participants randomly assign receive one two typical medication OCD , clomipramine escitalopram . Individuals would like participate previously try one medication may instead take new drug , duloxetine , undergo identical procedure . The factor investigator study include demographic ( i.e . age , gender , age onset OCD ) , genetic marker ( variant gene involve break drug liver ( cytochrome P450 system ) , gene involve several brain chemical system , serotonin ) , dimension OCD symptom ( i.e . checking , wash , hoard ) cortical inhibition . Cortical inhibition measure transcranial magnetic stimulation study deficit process may important development OCD . The investigator hypothesize certain pretreatment clinical characteristic correlate poor treatment response include early age onset , long duration illness , increase YBOCS severity presence significant hoarding symptom . The investigator expect increase degree deficit CI pre-treatment predict poor treatment response , increase CI pre- post-treatment correlate positive treatment response . Differences genetic marker status cytochrome P450 gene correlate tolerability and/or response , well differences genetic marker status SLC1A1 , GRIN2B , 5HT1B 5HT2A correlate response .</brief_summary>
