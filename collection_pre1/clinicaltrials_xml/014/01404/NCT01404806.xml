	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study describe first dose steady state pharmacokinetics GSK1349572 cervicovaginal fluid ( CVF ) vaginal ( VT ) cervical ( CT ) tissue compare blood plasma ( BP ) HIV-1 negative woman . Based current literature , GSK1349572 demonstrate desirable pharmacokinetic profile BP , include low moderate pharmacokinetic variability ( CV % 9-41 ) , extend t1/2 ( 13-15h ) trough concentration remain 25-fold high protein-adjusted IC90 ~0.064µg/mL wild type virus . Understanding pharmacokinetic behavior GSK1349572 multiple female biological compartment inform role sterilize genital tract HIV-infected woman , well protect mucosal tissue HIV infection ( pre/post-exposure prophylaxis ) .</detailed_description>
