	<brief_summary>The overall goal research develop safe effective iron intervention administer without production plasma non-transferrin-bound iron ( NTBI : iron systemic circulation bound iron-transport protein transferrin ) . The appearance plasma non-transferrin-bound iron report uninfected adult volunteer oral administration iron supplement dose similar use Pemba trial . This research project ( ) confirm appearance plasma non-transferrin-bound iron administration iron supplement like Pemba trial ( ~1 mg Fe/kg body weight , without food ) , determine effect production plasma non-transferrin-bound iron iron absorption measure stable isotope ( ii ) give supplemental iron ( ~1 mg Fe/kg ) standard rice meal , ( iii ) give low dose iron ( ~0.1 mg Fe/kg ) — like use home fortification — standard rice meal .</brief_summary>
