	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : In VIP ( Veterans Intensive Personalized ) Treatment Heart Failure Study assess 2 novel intervention enhance adherence improve quality life ( QOL ) veterans heart failure ( HF ) . This theory-based pilot 3-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) base one active arm Transtheoretical Model ( TTM ) , active arm add environmental ( built human ) tailor TTM . The overarch hypothesis drive proposal behavioral intervention ( BI ) , use TTM , behavioral environment-tailored intervention ( BEI ) low HF recurrence improve QOL good medication diet adherence compare attention control . RESEARCH DESIGN : This practice-based RCT test effect BI BEI medication diet adherence . The study embed typical VA healthcare 3 arm incorporate enhancement HF care implement include Patient Aligned Care Teams ( PACT ) , system redesign method improve HF care , ongoing HF quality improvement Telehealth . We randomize 99 participant equally BI , BEI AP . All analyse intent treat . METHODOLOGY : The study sit VAMC 's Manhattan Brooklyn . Participants veterans class I-III HF prescribe HF medication 6 month . Men woman ( 21 year ) history clinical finding chronic , stable HF NYHA functional class I ( previously symptomatic/now asymptomatic ) , II , III eligible . They must available phone 2 clinic visit previous 1.5 year . Patients poor short-term survival ( &lt; 1 year ) , recent major surgery ( &lt; 3 month ) , temporarily area , unable provide consent exclude . After screened eligibility , participant come 2 study visit course 6 month last 1.5-2 hour . At visit , research assistant ( RA ) administer questionnaire assess health behavior include diet , exercise medication quality life . The RAs also measure height , weight , take 6 BP reading , send patient lab blood urine sample . After first clinic visit , participant randomize one three telephone group . All participant receive 1 phone call per month 6 month last approximately 30-40 minute . 1 ) The BI group receive TTM stage-matched counseling . The interventionist ass ready patient change term diet , medication , exercise adherence deliver tailor intervention discuss adherence barrier . 2 ) In BEI , addition use TTM , intervention tailor environmental factor , availability healthy food store , recreational facility , support caregiver help participant follow treatment recommendation . We speak participant 's caregiver educate heart failure well . The caregiver receive call every 2 month ( 3 total ) last approximately 20-30 minute . 3 ) The control group receive monthly telephone call receive general health education . Our primary analytic goal estimate medication adherence rate QOL power large study . We also perform 1-sample Exact Binomial Tests compare active arm expect inactive control rate 47 % . Since pilot study , use 5 % type 1 error rate ( 2-sided ) test . All analyse intent treat .</detailed_description>
