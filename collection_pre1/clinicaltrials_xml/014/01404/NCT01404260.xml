	<brief_summary>Platinum-based combination chemotherapy , gemcitabine-carboplatin , one standard first-line therapy advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) clinical efficacy , compare best supportive care standard chemotherapy , give second-line third-line therapy advance NSCLC . Treatment EGFR-TKI effective female , never-smoker , patient adenocarcinoma , patient Asian origin . In population , treatment associate favorable objective response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival . These population also relatively high incidence somatic mutation region EGFR gene encodes tyrosine kinase domain . The recent study ( IPASS ) Tony S. Mok show gefitinib superior carboplatin-paclitaxel initial treatment pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmoker former light smoker East Asia . In subgroup 261 patient positive EGFR gene mutation , PFS significantly longer among received gefitinib among receive carboplatin-paclitaxel ( HR= 0.48 , P &lt; 0.001 ) , whereas subgroup 176 patient negative mutation , PFS significantly longer among receive carboplatin-paclitaxel ( HR=2.85 , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Gefitinib treatment well tolerate , low hematologic toxicity , treatment-related interstitial lung disease.In study ( IPASS ) , patient mutation EGFR gene tumor could get benefit gefitinib first line treatment . Tony S. Mok colleague also find intercalate maintenance administration erlotinib ( another EGFR-TKI ) follow gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy first line therapy lead significant improvement PFS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nowadays , EGFR mutation status unknown advance NSCLC patient clinical practice.Those patient high probability EGFR mutation maybe could get benefit gefitinib first-line treatment . For reason , investigator need investigation focus EGFR mutation unknown patient . In previous study ( include FAST-ACT ) , patient enrol trial receive EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy nearly simultaneously , investigator could know whether patient gained benefit EGFR-TKI chemotherapy , maybe chemotherapy alone enough . If patient EGFR mutation status unknown could get stable disease ( SD ) two cycle chemotherapy , patient may optimal investigation intercalate maintenance administration gefitinib . The reason chemotherapy may enough objective response two cycle chemotherapy , course , disease progression ( PD ) exclude study . On basis study , investigator hypothesize select population , first-line chemotherapy ( gemcitabine +carboplatin ) intercalate maintenance use gefitinib would efficacious chemotherapy alone . In study , investigator compare efficacy , safety , adverse-event profile chemotherapy plus gefitinib chemotherapy alone , drug use first-line treatment nonsmoker former light smoker China , lung adenocarcinoma EGFR gene mutation unknown .</detailed_description>
