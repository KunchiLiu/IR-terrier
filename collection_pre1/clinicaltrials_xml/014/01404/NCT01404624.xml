	<brief_summary>The problem point Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) patient obesity intense plasma ghrelin level increase unusual recently PWS patient discover . The Ghrelin endogeneous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor peptide hormone location 3p26-p25 . Becomes secretion even nervous system dignity X/A cell secrete mainly growth important even vagal control food intake dignity function even action outside promotes secretion drive operate . It increase food intake specially order accomplish action diminishes fat utilization obesity week cause mortar thought . Active ghrelin form essential hormonal activity ghrelin appetite growth hormone participate secretion promotion drive . Action Ghrelin measure quantitative change middle acylated PWS patient ghrelin order happen acylation initially one interest ghrelin attempt appetite PWS patient control method able prove thing directly , use RIA kit ELISA able measure kit able measure whole ghrelin pick PWS patient blood normal army active ghrelin measure change .</brief_summary>
