	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) take long time complex perform parallel procedure , cause discomfort patient . It commonly perform sedation endoscopy . Until recently , combination administration midazolam opioid widely use standard therapy due superior sedation effect compare sedation agent . Midazolam , however , problem , insufficient sedation effect intermittent paradoxical response . Unlike midazolam , propofol antagonist may cause problem respiratory depression , narrow therapeutic range sedation effect , consequently require supervision experience expert , although good sedation effect midazolam . Due disadvantage , propofol clinically less useful midazolam . Meanwhile , dexmedetomidine , selective α2 adrenergic agonist , know maintain proper level sedation weak influence respiratory depression . Recent study show positive result dexmedetomidine relation sedation effect surgery patient local anesthesia intensive care unit . As , extensive study conduct use dexmedetomidine endoscopic procedure due increase attention dexmedetomidine . This notwithstanding , clinical usefulness dexmedetomidine still debatable . In particular , study use dexmedetomidine ERCP rare . Given recent idea dexmedetomidine may exert synergistic effect combination midazolam , author endeavor prospectively compare analyze sedation effect adverse event , include respiratory depression , combination therapy midazolam meperidine , widely use patient undergo ERCP , combination therapy midazolam , meperidine , dexmedetomidine . The small-scale comparative study combination administration propofol fentanyl , high risk cause complication , single administration dexmedetomidine study sedation effect dexmedetomidine ERCP procedure yet conduct ; study investigate effect combination administration dexmedetomidine drug ERCP procedure . This study thus expect contribute development guideline sedation ERCP procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compared upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) take long time perform cause discomfort patient . In ERCP , benzodiazepine alone combination opioid commonly use pain control sedation . Of various benzodiazepine drug , midazolam , water-soluble , show act faster good term anterograde amnesia sedation effect drug . As midazolam suitable antagonist ( flumazenil ) , prompt measure take case situation hypopnea . As midazolam report increase sedation effect level satisfaction patient use combination opioid ( meperidine ) , combination midazolam meperidine widely use regimen far . The American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommend combination midazolam meperidine standard regimen induce sedation upper low gastrointestinal endoscopy . Several study report , however , midazolam alone combination midazolam meperidine insufficient induce sedation effect ( 47-80 % ) . Besides , midazolam disadvantage produce paradoxical response time , make performance procedure impossible . In many study , propofol , preferred alternative midazolam , recently find superior midazolam term sedation effect , cause adverse event . Because propofol intermittently cause serious respiratory failure antagonist , however , clinician feel burden use propofol , due widely use . Moreover , anesthesia specialist well experience assistant staff receive relevant education training available , tool need promptly handle cardiopulmonary complication hand , lower usefulness propofol clinical practice . The sedation effect dexmedetomidine , however , selective α2 adrenergic receptor , proportional dose , allow continuous injection make possible reduce opioid dose need sedation use sedation . Dexmedetomidine report maintain proper level sedation , influence less respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , respiratory tract response . Due advantage , several recent study report dexmedetomidine effective sedation upper low gastrointestinal procedure . A combination dexmedetomidine midazolam investigate recent trial animal clinical trial , synergic effect show several study . In animal trial use rat , Boehm et al . report midazolam increase dose-related analgesic effect dexmedetomidine use combination dexmedetomidine . Bol et al . report combined administration dexmedetomidine midazolam increase sedation effect reduce adverse cardiovascular event significantly single administration . In addition , study rat , Salonen et al . demonstrate synergic effect combination two drug flumazenil antagonize combination two drug dose-dependent manner . In one representative clinical trial , Bergese et al . compare combination dexmedetomidine midazolam midazolam-alone regimen 55 patient underwent awake fibrotic intubation ( AFOI ) . Although hemodynamic difference two group , combination regimen good sedation effect , result high level satisfaction among patient , lead few adverse event single regimen . Besides , study patient underwent cardiovascular surgery , Dasta et al . report use dexmedetomidine combination standard sedation regimen decrease mortality reduce period mechanical ventilation cost . Heard et al . report combined administration midazolam dexmedetomidine sufficient sedation effect patient undergone MRI without adverse event . In study Heard et al. , however , subject child , propofol use control drug instead midazolam . So far , study report effect combination administration dexmedetomidine midazolam gastrointestinal endoscopy , include ERCP . Given synergic effect two drug usefulness dexmedetomidine endoscopy , study urgently need . Though study Muller et al . effect combined administration , study investigate sedation effect dexmedetomidine ERCP . In study Muller et al . 26 patient undergone ERCP ( 12 receive dexmedetomidine 14 , propofol ) , report effect sedation pain control weak dexmedetomidine group propofol group ( RR : 2.71/9.42 NNT : 1.85/1.42 , respectively ) , hemodynamic instability high dexmedetomidine group base subject ' mean blood pressure heart rate . The study Muller et al . limitation , however , dose dexmedetomidine low study scale study small . Moreover , although mean blood pressure heart rate lower dexmedetomidine group propofol group , clinically significant decrease blood pressure heart rate observe . Moreover , propofol , use control group , may impose heavy burden relation depress respiratory effect absence antagonist ( flumazenil ) , unlike midazolam , describe previously , act fast require experienced assistant staff ; usefulness frequency use propofol clinical practice low . In addition , study Muller et al . single dexmedetomidine administration , comparison combine administration dexmedetomidine midazolam single administration propofol produce sedation effect could result different outcome . As , believe sedation effect adverse event combine administration dexmedetomidine midazolam single administration midazolam patient undergone ERCP study . As described previously , midazolam consider suitable control drug useful propofol clinical practice . Moreover , since combination dexmedetomidine midazolam synergic effect sedation , combination believe meaningful single dexmedetomidine administration . In addition , cardiovascular respiratory safety single dexmedetomidine administration combine administration dexmedetomidine midazolam , report several previous study , show satisfactory study . Whether synergic effect safety see well gastrointestinal endoscopy , particularly ERCP , investigate ; study yet investigate combined administration dexmedetomidine midazolam patient undergo ERCP , study consider meaningful .</detailed_description>
