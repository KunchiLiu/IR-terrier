	<brief_summary>The best treatment resectable esophageal cancer cancer esophagus stomach ( GE junction ) unknown . Although operation remove esophagus common treatment , previous study show patient live long either chemotherapy chemotherapy plus radiation ( chemoradiation ) give surgery ( preoperative ) , compare surgery alone . However unknown treatment ( preoperative chemotherapy preoperative chemoradiation ) effective improve survival . A study patient resectable esophageal / GE junction cancer choose random receive one two preoperative treatment would help determine one form treatment improve survival compare . Patients localized esophageal / GE junction cancer ( adenocarcinoma ) randomize receive either preoperative chemotherapy preoperative chemoradiation follow surgery . The main objective pilot trial determine possibility conduct large study many center participate . If study prof feasible enough patient enrol able tolerate treatment without major side effect hopefully proceed perform large multi-center trial look survival outcome difference patient receive preoperative chemotherapy receive preoperative chemoradiation . The result trial would ultimately help u choose effective treatment resectable esophageal cancer hopefully improve survival .</brief_summary>
