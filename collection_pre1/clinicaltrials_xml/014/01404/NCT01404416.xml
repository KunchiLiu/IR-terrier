	<brief_summary>The follow-up study base previous nutritional intervention trial entitle `` Impact Prenatal Vitamin/Mineral Supplements Perinatal Mortality ( NCT00133744 ) '' . We follow livebirths bear woman trial measure height , weight , hemoglobin implement questionaire survey ( include developmental milestone , disease history , breast feeding , passive smoking , et al ) . We select sub-sample infant assess IQ , emotional behavioral problem , language development status . The outcomes interest include death , body mass index , overweight/ obesity , stunting/ wasting/ thinness , anemia , developmental milestone , IQ , emotional behavioral disorder , language developmental status , disease history . Other interesting exposure include breast feeding , passive smoking , et al . We hypothesize intrauterine nutritional exposure impact offspring 's physical , mental , language development . We also hypothesize cesarean delivery include CDMR impact offspring 's outcome .</brief_summary>
