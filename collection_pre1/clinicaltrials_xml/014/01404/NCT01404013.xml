	<brief_summary>This study aim observe therapeutic effect leukotriene modulator montelukast alone combine inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) cough variant asthma ( CVA ) . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Cough score cough reflex sensitivity improve treatment montelukast , inhale corticosteroid/β2 agonist ( ICS/LABA ) , two combination . 2 . Combination leukotriene modulator inhale corticosteroid/β2 agonist may better efficacy compare montelukast , corticosteroid/β2 agonist alone MON , comparable symbicort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study group : 99 patient diagnosed CVA randomise three group follow : Group 1 : inhale corticosteroid+β2 agonist The patient cough variant asthma receive Symbicort Turbuhaler ( Budesonide 160µg Formoterol 4.5µg ) 1puff Q12h 8 week . Group 2 : montelukast The patient cough variant asthma receive montelukast 10mg QN 8 week , without corticosteroid β2 agonist . Group 3 : montelukast combine inhaled corticosteroid+β2 agonist The patient cough variant asthma receive montelukast 10mg QN combine Symbicort Turbuhaler ( Budesonide 160µg Formoterol 4.5µg ) 1puff Q12h 8 weeks.. The study divide follow phase : 1 . First Visit ( Visit 1 , day -6 ) : A full medical history physical examination undertaken determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . After informed consent sign , follow sample obtain patient : blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology , biochemistry chest x-ray ) . A urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential . Bronchial provocation test methacholine inhalation perform determined presence bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness . Patients give Diary Card . 2 . Screening Period ( day -6 day 0 , 6 Days ) Patients take two medication bellow 3 day follow 3 day wash-out period . Patients complete 6 day diary card , start day -6 week 0 . Bambuterol HCI ( Bambec , brand name ) , 10 mg qn po Theophylline tablet sustain release , 100mg bid po 3 . Second Visit ( Visit 2 , Week 0 ) : A physical examination perform . All laboratory test result obtain determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Concurrent medication record . The Diary Card collect , review assessed whether ICS , bronchodilator ICS/BD treatment efficient cough symptom ( symptom score improve 1 least ) . Capsaicin challenge test FENO perform hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential , urine leukotriene , serum IgE , take enrolled patient . Enrolled patient randomize different group , study medication dispense . 4 . During Treatment 1 ( Week 0 Week 4 , 14 day ) : Patients take study medication 28 day complete Diary Card 7 day Week 3 Week 4 . 5 . Third Visit ( Visit 3 , Week 4 ) : A physical examination perform . The Diary Card collect review . Adverse event , secondary complication , concurrent medication record . Capsaicin challenge test FENO perform hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take enrolled patient . 6 . During Treatment 2 ( Week 4 Week 8 , 14 day ) : Patients take study medication 28 day complete Diary Card 7 day Week 7 Week 8 . 7 . Forth Visit ( Visit 4 , Week 8 ) : A physical examination perform . The Diary Card collect review . Residual ( unused ) medication return . Adverse event , secondary complication , concurrent medication record . Capsaicin challenge test FENO perform hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential , urine leukotriene , serum IgE , take enrolled patient . Blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology biochemistry ) obtain , clinically significant laboratory abnormal result note visit 4 , AE follow-up visit would consider .</detailed_description>
