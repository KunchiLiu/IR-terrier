	<brief_summary>Interactive game ( virtual reality ) recently center interest scientific discussion field cognitive functional rehabilitation . From entertain contextual aspect , off-the-shelf video game potentially interesting tool adjunct patient care , especially maintain instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) autonomy . Disease physical inactivity worsen patient 's ability IADLs , thus reduce health relate quality life ( HRQL ) . This decrease cognitive functional ability slow use adapted rehabilitation program . However , randomize control study compare usual physical therapy virtual reality game console Nintendo Wii Xbox 360 Kinect . Off-the-shelf gaming console offer large range game cognitive functional ability geriatric patient could stimulate consequently HRQL improve . However , good knowledge potential cognitive functional improvement process virtual reality rehabilitation institutional routine need enhance quality range available care old adult . This study validation platform virtual reality stand alone rehabilitation process also assess cost effectiveness off-the-shelf gaming console HRQL improvement old adult . The investigator compare efficacy two off-the-shelf gaming console HRQL change patient Alzheimer disease relate disorder . â€¢Method This study randomize control trial comprises two study phase : Phase one ; compare three parallel group therapist assessor keep blind study objective , Phase two , investigator take cost-effective gaming console phase one ( Nintendo Wii Xbox 360 Kinect ) investigator use adjunct physical therapy compare physical therapy alone , respect amount rehabilitation time . The intervention 120min/week 6 week follow-up 4 week intervention . Patients randomize either Xbox 360 Kinect group - Nintendo Wii group - physical therapy 'gold ' standard condition . All group receive amount rehabilitation time . Power sample calculation phase two base phase one result .</brief_summary>
