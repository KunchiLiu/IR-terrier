	<brief_summary>Traditional cardiac surgery require patient connection Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB ) apparatus take function heart lung surgeon performs necessary surgery . The residual blood leave CPB equipment ( 1.5-2.0 L ) centrifuge wash leave red blood cell ( RBCs ) suspend saline solution . The RBCs reinfused patient need anesthesiologist . The main problem technique many important component blood plasma proteins clot factor discard cell wash . This study explore novel method ( multiple-pass hemofiltration ) process residual pump blood allow patient receive whole blood minimum waste important component . The new method process residual pump volume also term off-line modified ultrafiltration ( off-line MUF ) similar process kidney use filter blood . It hypothesize multiple-pass hemofiltration residual CPB volume reduce occurrence inflammatory response , preserve plasma protein , decrease allogenic blood exposure improve clinical outcome compare centrifugation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study perform traditional method recovery residual volume blood cardiopulmonary bypass circuit involve centrifugation wash whole blood saline solution . This process sufficient recovery red blood cell however ; result discard important component blood . The removal white blood cell , plasma protein clot factor may result increase risk adverse outcomes post-operative period . The new technique team want investigate return great proportion patient ' whole blood reinfusion . Our study objective compare two technique determine technique produce safe reliable method blood processing help patient smooth , short , transfusion free post-operative period intensive care unit ( ICU ) .</detailed_description>
