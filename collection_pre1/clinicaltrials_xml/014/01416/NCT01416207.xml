	<detailed_description>Rationale Study : The purpose study characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile Avonex Chinese healthy volunteer subject . Data study use support registration Avonex China . Study Design : This multiple-dose , single-arm , open-label , PK/PD safety study . Four weekly injection Avonex administer intramuscularly ( IM ) . Frequent ( intensive ) blood sample collect first fourth injection Avonex , sparse blood sample collect second third injection Avonex . Four Avonex IM injection administer study . Due long-term use Avonex MS patient , multiple-dose PK/PD study necessary order provide adequate information evaluate change drug concentration time Chinese healthy subject . Serum level interferon beta Caucasian healthy volunteer show peak 3 15 hour administration Avonex IM dose use study show decline rate consistent 10-hour elimination half-life ; therefore , accumulation interferon beta follow multiple weekly Avonex IM injection anticipate . Exposure healthy subject multiple dos Avonex study anticipate present safety tolerability issue base experience previous Avonex study conduct healthy volunteer subject MS patient . Flu-like symptom associate dose Avonex generally mostly mild-to-moderate intensity short duration , typically experience within first 24 hour injection . Prophylactic analgesic medication must administer prior Avonex injection study recommend practice use interferon therapy order ameliorate flu-like symptom . Study Location : China , 1 Phase 1 study site . Duration Treatment Follow-up : Approximately 2 month , include 28-day Screening Baseline period , 3-week Treatment blood sample period 14-day Follow-Up period . Statistical Methods : PK/PD parameter calculate use non-compartmental method . Summary statistic PK/PD parameter calculate . Mean concentration value plot time linear logarithmic scale . The incidence treatment-emergent AEs summarize . Vital sign examine determine incidence clinically relevant abnormality . Laboratory evaluation assess determine incidence abnormality . Changes laboratory evaluation summarize use shift table summary statistic .</detailed_description>
