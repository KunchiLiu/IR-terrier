	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerability Subcutaneously Administered Treprostinil Sodium Patients With Severe ( Non-operable ) Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension ( CTREPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) characterize non-resolving organize thromboembolic obstruct pulmonary vascular bed ( Lang , 1994 ) . These thrombi resistant thrombolytic therapy chronic plasmatic anticoagulation . An increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , right ventricular overload , eventually right ventricular failure ensue . The treatment choice CTEPH pulmonary endarterectomy ( PEA ) , provide potential cure disease ( Klepetko , 2004 ) ) . However , 50 % patient candidate surgery , mainly distal location thromboemboli . Despite recent advance treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) ( McLaughlin , 2004 ) , medical treatment recommend inoperable CTEPH , concept predominantly major vessel obstructive arteriopathy would suitable vasodilator . Furthermore , major drawback i.v . prostacyclin therapy need permanent central venous access increase risk infection ( 0.22-0.68 per patient per year ) ( Kuhn , 2003 ) , thrombosis new major vessel thromboembolism .</detailed_description>
