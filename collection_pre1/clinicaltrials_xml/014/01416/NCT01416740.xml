	<brief_summary>This study prospectively compare finding two diagnostic test , Direct Magnetic Resonance Arthrography ( MRA ) Indirect MRA , finding shoulder arthroscopy patient shoulder pain . The sensitivity specificity Direct Indirect MRA 's diagnose specific pathology shoulder determine use shoulder arthroscopy gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Indirect Direct MR Arthrography Shoulder Using Arthroscopic Correlation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct MR arthrography ( MRA ) require injection contrast agent shoulder fluoroscopic ultrasound guidance , follow magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This invasive , risks infection , require time resource . It recently show intravenous administration gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances joint cavity MRI thus indirectly produce arthrographic effect ( Indirect MRA ) . The study enroll patient already Direct MRA part standard care diagnostic test shoulder pain , determine surgeon arthroscopic surgery indicate ask would willing Indirect MRA prior arthroscopic surgery . The patient need blood test ( BUN Creatinine ) do ensure kidney function normal , serum urine pregnancy test , female , ensure pregnancy , prior completion Indirect MRA . After patient 's schedule shoulder arthroscopic surgery , result two MR arthrography technique compare sensitivity specificity detect partial full thickness rotator cuff tear , labral tear , long head biceps dislocation/tearing , grade IV cartilage lesion compare result actual arthroscopic finding . The Direct MR arthrography arthroscopic surgery standard care would occur regardless study , Indirect MR arthrography diagnostic intervention study-related .</detailed_description>
