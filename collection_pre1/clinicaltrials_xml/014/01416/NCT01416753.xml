	<detailed_description>Hypothesis In comparison conventional hemodialysis , regulation ultrafiltration dialysate conductivity ( UCR ) and/or regulation ultrafiltration temperature ( UTR ) decrease intra- postdialytic complication ultrafiltration volume systematically increase fluid overload hemodialysis patient . Objectives Outcome Measures The primary objective demonstrate superiority ultrafiltration dialysate conductivity regulation ( UCR ) and/or ultrafiltration temperature regulation ( UTR ) conventional hemodialysis , prevent intra- postdialytic complication , fluid overload hemodialysis patient receive systematic fluid reduction , reach final dry weight 7 % ECW postdialysis . The primary outcome measure total number hemodialysis session per patient accompany , intra- postdialytically , least one symptom likely related fluid withdrawal ( specify Table 1 ) , divide number hemodialysis session risk ( study protocol : 12 session per patient study phase 1 ) . Both group , UCR UTR , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . The secondary objective : 1 . To demonstrate superiority ultrafiltration dialysate conductivity regulation ( UCR ) and/or ultrafiltration temperature regulation ( UTR ) conventional hemodialysis , prevent specific intradialytic complication : 1. intradialytic cramp 2. clinically asymptomatic , intradialytic hypotension ( &gt; 40 mmHg drop systolic blood pressure within 30 minute ) 3. clinically symptomatic , intradialytic hypotension ( &gt; 40 mmHg drop systolic blood pressure within 30 minute ) 4. clinically symptomatic , intradialytic hypotension ( even possible identify sudden drop blood pressure , e.g . patient may slowly move towards low blood pressure value [ f. ex . 100 mmHg systolic blood pressure ] , report symptom ) 5. unspecified intradialytic symptom event , likely related fluid withdrawal 6. patient-reported postdialysis complication , likely related fluid withdrawal fluid overload hemodialysis patient receive systematic fluid reduction , reach final dry weight -7 % ECW postdialysis . The secondary outcome measure objective [ ] total number hemodialysis session per patient accompany respective symptom likely related fluid withdrawal ( 1 6 ) , divide number hemodialysis session risk ( study protocol : 12 session per patient study phase 1 ) . Both group , UCR UTR , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . 2 . To demonstrate superiority UCR and/or UTR conventional hemodialysis allow patient reach low body weight , relative his/her postdialysis weight begin study phase 1 ( time zero ) . The secondary outcome measure objective [ b ] difference postdialysis body weight time zero end study phase 1 , divide postdialysis body weight time zero . Example : If patient postdialysis body weight 65 kg time zero ( last hemodialysis session first dry weight reduction ) , reach postdialysis body weight 62 kg end first study phase , difference body weight 65 kg - 62 kg =3 kg . Relative patient 's postdialysis body weight time zero , weight reduction begin end study phase 1 3/65*100=4.61 % . The relative weight reduction group , UCR UTR , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . 3 . To assess strict volume control fluid overload patient ( use UCR , UTR conventional hemodialysis ) diminish residual renal function . The secondary outcome measure objective [ c ] difference 24h urine volume time zero end study phase 1 , divide urine volume time zero . The relative urine reduction group , UCR UTR , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . 4 . To assess amount sodium transfer patient withdrawn patient conventional hemodialysis , UCR UTR . The amount sodium remove hemodialysis function ultrafiltration volume , effective diffusion gradient sodium , diffusive sodium clearance . The effective diffusion gradient depend plasma water - dialysate sodium ( DNa ) difference , Gibbs-Donnan coefficient , latter function plasma protein concentration also influence ion dialysate . The assumption sodium removal ultrafiltration equal plasma water sodium concentration , multiplied ultrafiltration volume , simplification . Electrolyte balance may also influence membrane charge . Therefore , amount sodium transfer measured dialysate side . Sodium transfer calculate difference mean sodium concentration partially collect , use dialysate fresh DNa concentration , multiply total amount dialysate use . Results compare two pool sodium model parameter model adjust use measure transfer data . The described method applicable UCR group sodium concentration fresh dialysate keep constant treatment . In order establish model , measure least 10 patient 3 hemodialysis session , due formerly state , use dialysate patient conventional hemodialysis group UTR group . However , establish model , sodium transfer patient - conventional , UTR , UCR - calculate use model . The amount sodium transfer withdrawn patient calculate patient , accord model establish way state . The secondary outcome measure objective [ ] , e.g . sodium transfer group , UCR UTR , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . 5 . To assess strict volume control conventional hemodialysis , UCR and/or UTR influence predialysis serum concentration ( 1 ) C-reactive protein , ( 2 ) D-dimer , ( 3 ) fibrinogen , ( 4 ) troponin T , ( 5 ) N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide . These protein use read-outs inflammation ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , coagulation ( 2 , 3 ) , cardiac function ( 4 , 5 ) routinely determine three participate center . The secondary outcome measure objective [ e ] , e.g . concentration indicate laboratory parameter group , UCR UTR , time zero end study phase 1 , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . The individual change parameter , time zero end study phase 1 , compare likewise . 6 . To assess strict volume control fluid overload patient ( use UCR , UTR conventional hemodialysis ) affect concentration various protein might serve novel biomarkers ( include high density lipoprotein [ HDL ] -associated surfactant protein B , HDL-associated serum amyloid A , HDL-associated apoC-II , plasma tryptophan , plasma choline , plasma trimethylanine-N-oxide ; plasma endotoxin ) . We recently discover various protein , include mention , may render HDL dysfunctional , hemodialysis patient . Especially surfactant , suspect association fluid overload . Moreover , plasma tryptophan , plasma choline , plasma trimethylanine-N-oxide marker end stage renal disease . Since one several protein molecule might serve novel biomarkers , would like use context present trial establish diagnostic assay analyze potential change serum concentration protein , fluid removal . Endotoxin , find cell membrane gram-negative bacteria , biomarker represent gut flora . Endotoxin show associated inflammation , nutritional status even mortality hemodialysis patient . An incremental rise endotoxin level show along progression chronic kidney disease , especially initiation hemodialysis . It suggest hemodialysis patient might high endotoxin level blood due repeat bacterial translocation gut hemodialysis , secondary intradialytic change blood pressure and/or tissue perfusion . An association chronic fluid overload yet establish , might suspect , consequence high ultrafiltration rate thus decrease intradialytic stability . Here measure endotoxin level amebocyte limulus assay study patient , time zero end study phase 1 . The secondary outcome measure objective [ f ] , example HDL-associated serum amyloid A group , UCR UTR , time zero end study phase 1 , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . The individual change parameter , time zero end study phase 1 , compare likewise . The result secondary endpoint analysis publish separately clinical result present study . 7 . To assess strict volume control fluid overload patient ( use UCR , UTR conventional hemodialysis ) affect quality life measure . The secondary outcome measure objective [ g ] mental component summary ( MCS ) physical component summary ( PCS ) derive Kidney Disease Quality Life Short Form ( KDQoL-SFTM ) . The scale summary score 0-100 ( high indicate well quality life ) . MCS PCS group , UCR UTR , time zero end study phase 1 , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , use two-sided Student 's t-test . The individual change parameter , time zero end study phase 1 , compare likewise . 8 . To demonstrate superiority UCR and/or UTR conventional hemodialysis reduce dialysis complication previously fluid overloaded patient enter phase 2 phase 3 present study . In study phase 2 3 , patient either reduce dry weight , else maintain newly reach dry weight . The secondary outcome measure objective [ h ] potentially item describe , compare conventional hemodialysis group , afterwards one another , fashion describe . 9 . To assess hemodialysis treatment modality chosen patient end study . The choice treatment compare follow : ( 1 ) number patient choose UCR-treatment number patient choose conventional treatment ; ( 2 ) number patient choose UTR-treatment number patient choose conventional treatment ; ( 3 ) number patient choose UCR-treatment number patient choose UTR-treatment . The statistical test analysis ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) ( 3 ) two-sided chi square test , analysis . Superiority definition For objective list , superiority assume statistically significant difference one group versus another group determine . With regard primary endpoint , accord sample size calculation ( see ) , study suit detect minimal difference 10 % group .</detailed_description>
