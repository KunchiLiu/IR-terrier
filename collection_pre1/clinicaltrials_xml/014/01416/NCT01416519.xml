	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) prolong improve quality life patient ischemic coronary syndrome advancement medical intervention eligible patient procedure comorbidities conservation palliative therapy try without success . Patients undergo CABG often develop pulmonary complication atelectasis , restrictive ventilatory defect , decrease lung compliance , increase shunt change gas exchange lead probable hypoxemia . In attempt reduce harmful effect pulmonary complication arise surgical procedure institute extensive physiotherapy program track monitor patient preoperative postoperative immediate transfer ward hospital discharge . The objective study ass whether difference care protocol use incentive spirometry ( Voldyne ® ) another application NIV ( non invasive ventilation single-level pressure ) form therapy .
