	<brief_summary>The late infantile form galactosialidosis potentially amenable treatment gene transfer adeno-associated viral vector encode Protective Protein Cathepsin A ( PPCA ) infusion purify protein . The published literature contains limited description disease know many patient disorder potentially available protocol enrollment . This preliminary study design define demographic clinical characteristic patient population galactosialidosis . Individuals DNA diagnosis perform St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) contact telephonically learn current status . In addition , letter request information regard patient galactosialidosis send pediatric geneticist throughout United States . Selected physician expertise lysosomal storage disease throughout world also contact . Foundations Associations lysosomal storage disorder also contact effort identify additional potential patient galactosialidosis . The information collect preliminary study facilitate development specific eligibility criterion future therapeutic study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individual patient/families interview telephone learn basic demographic information disease status . Medical record request primary care provider provide information regard disorder . Individual patient identify survey pediatric geneticist via disease foundation association send letter describe purpose include consent form subsequent telephonic interview . Their medical record also request .</detailed_description>
