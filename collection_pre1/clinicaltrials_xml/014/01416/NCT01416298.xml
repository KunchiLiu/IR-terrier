	<brief_summary>Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) common clinical problem define abrupt ( &lt; 48 hour ) increase serum creatinine ( SCr ) result injury insult cause functional structural change kidney . Despite significant advancement care critically ill child , mortality rate observe critically ill child develop AKI improve . The investigator show even `` small '' increase SCr , standard kidney function marker , associate increase child mortality , even outcome control significant patient co-morbidity . Furthermore , investigator also show amount fluid accumulation observe critically ill child AKI independently associate mortality suggest early dialysis may improve survival . However , investigator also want dialyze patient n't ultimately need dialysis , invasive procedure . The data cite highlight need detect AKI early , also predict severity order optimize clinical decision make respect fluid administration dialysis initiation . While substantial research expend validate NGAL early marker AKI , study context clinical decision support guide therapeutic intervention . The investigator hypothesize NGAL level use determine predict critically ill child develop severe prolong AKI substantial volume overload , thereby provide clinician diagnostic tool guide CRRT initiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim proposal : 1 . Determine NGAL ( POC plasma confirmatory urine ) concentration predict critically ill child ultimately develop significant ( &gt; 10 % ) positive ICU fluid accumulation Hypothesis test : Elevated plasma NGAL concentration ( initial plasma threshold &gt; 250 ng/ml ) predict critically ill child develop positive ICU net fluid accumulation &gt; 10 % ICU admission weight 2 . Determine NGAL ( POC plasma confirmatory urine ) concentration predict critically ill child develop &gt; 10-20 % ICU fluid overload recover urine output kidney function rapidly Hypothesis test : Elevated plasma NGAL concentration ( initial urinary threshold &gt; 1 ng/mg Cr ) predict critically ill child develop &gt; 10-20 % FO improvement AKI determine improvement least one pRIFLE stratum within 24-48 hour develop pRIFLE-I pRIFLE-F 3 . Determine NGAL ( POC plasma confirmatory urine ) concentration predict kidney function recovery critically ill child develop &gt; 10-20 % ICU fluid overload receive continuous renal replacement therapy Hypothesis test : Decreasing NGAL concentration associate improvement urine output initial resolution AKI &lt; 72 hour This pilot study novel investigator evaluate NGAL level near real-time , twice daily guide clinical decision support term fluid administration effect assessment CRRT provision critically ill pediatric population . Specifically , investigator use NGAL data daily 1 ) drive initiation CRRT child elevate NGAL &gt; 10-20 % fluid overload 2 ) drive CRRT discontinuation patient decrease NGAL concentration . In addition , investigator employ adaptive study design readjust threshold NGAL time course study data suggest adjustment enrich data pool .</detailed_description>
