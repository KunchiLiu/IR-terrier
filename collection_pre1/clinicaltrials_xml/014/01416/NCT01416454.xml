	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess potential age-related difference coagulation profile patient undergo Cesarean Section , use thromboelastography ( TEG ) . The investigator compare coagulation data collect study assess potential difference coagulation parameter follow age group : ( ) woman less 35 yr ( ii ) woman 35 yrs old . This study allow u collect information difference regard coagulation profile patient undergoing cesarean section le 35 vs. 35y old . This information add current knowledge base potential risk thrombotic event accord age . All obstetric patient present elective Cesarean delivery ( CD ) inform study prior admission labor delivery unit . Patients informed parent ' education class ( education session obstetric anesthesiologist also member research team ) . Potential participant approach member research team prior surgery . A study investigator obtain patient write informed consent . Pre-operatively , blood sample take place venepuncture follow analysis : Hematocrit , Platelet count ( part standard care ) , TEG , prothrombin time ( PT ) , Partial Thromboplastin Time ( PTT ) , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , fibrinogen ( research purpose , unless need clinical purpose ) . The investigator would prefer avoid take blood sample indwell peripheral IV line , sample likely dilute intravenous fluid therefore may significantly affect blood sample analysis . The volume blood necessary TEG analysis extremely small ( 1 ml - less half teaspoon - per TEG analysis ; total =3 sample ) , therefore significantly affect potential degree hemorrhage total blood loss incur . The volume blood laboratory analysis also small ( 4-5 ml - 1 teaspoon - research sample : total =3 sample ) , affect overall blood loss . No randomization possible . TEG laboratory sample take following time interval : prior anesthesia preoperative hold unit , post-operative day one three . Data assess normality use normality plot Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Normally non-normally distributed TEG parameter CD ( PACU sample ) assess use pair t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test respectively . The percentage change baseline TEG parameter Hb CD also calculate . Longitudinal analysis individual change TEG parameter perform use mixed effect regression modeling , due non-uniformity time-intervals account correlation among repeated measurement participant . The investigator examine longitudinal model individual TEG parameter dependent measure , study group fix factor , number previous cesarean section , total blood loss , IV fluid , platelet count fibrinogen count potential covariates ( tbc ) . Separate model incorporate age continuous independent variable ( fixed random effect ) . The investigator analyze data use SAS version 9.2 ( SAS Institute , Cary , N.C. , USA ) . Study data store secure , lock storage box access study investigator . Samples label identify use numerical system base allocate prior start study . Only investigator directly involve study access study data related document . Study data protect follow : Hard data store secure box-files keep lock file cabinet ; database study data password-protected . Study information cod advance use numerical coding system link patient ' medical record number PHI . Coding perform data enter database . Only study investigator access cod system de-identifying data . All code use protect study data confidential information use solely study investigator . All code use data- protection know study investigator , software-protection encryption program use appropriate . TEG perform study investigator labor delivery unit . Blood sample destroy TEG analysis . Other laboratory sample analyze per normal procedure . Electronic data store Stanford File Management Tool . Only researcher research staff grant password-protected access identifiable cod data store server . All person involve study receive appropriate training abide confidentiality guideline protect subject 's privacy . All HIPAA rule regulation strictly follow .</detailed_description>
