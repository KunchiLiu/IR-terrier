	<brief_title>Absolute Bioavialability GSK1120212</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , non-randomized study design determine absolute bioavailability standard 2 mg tablet formulation GSK1120212 co-administered intravenous microdose ( 5 μg ) dose [ 14C ] -labelled GSK1120212 ( 7.4 kBq ) subject solid tumor . Pharmacokinetic sampleswill obtain 10 day post-dose . Safety assessment , include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory value ( hematology clinical chemistry ) vital sign , perform throughout study . After complete assessment , eligible subject may transition MEK114375 , open-label , rollover study continue treatment GSK1120212 .</detailed_description>
