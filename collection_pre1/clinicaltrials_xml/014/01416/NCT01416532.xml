	<brief_title>Evaluation Subclinical COronary Atherosclerosis Risk Stratification Using Coronary Computed Tomography ( CT ) Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk stratification cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) asymptomatic individual represent major challenge . For purpose , lot risk prediction model take demographic clinical characteristic account develop . Although Framingham risk score ( FRS ) widely use among multiplr risk prediction model , limitation prediction CVD especially young adult woman . Recently , coronary artery calcium score ( CACS ) know powerful screen method CVD , however , detect noncalcified coronary plaque ( NCP ) , represent entire spectrum atherosclerotic plaque also evaluate degree stenosis . On contrary , Coronary CT angiography ( CCTA ) provide detailed coronary artery anatomy plaque image location , burden characteristic atherosclerotic plaque per se , might give additional insight stratify risk future cardiac event therapy . In study , evaluate prevalence characteristic subclinical coronary atherosclerosis CCTA asymptomatic population . And investiage follow data major cardiac adverse event cardiac death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , unstable angina revascularization . Therefore , finally evaluate prognostic value CCTA risk stratification asymptomatic adult comparsion conventional risk stratification FRS CACS .</detailed_description>
