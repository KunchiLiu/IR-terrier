	<detailed_description>Research Overview - The overarch aim study improve health outcome patient present EDs modify test disability diagnostic tool . The investigator expect accurate precise tool lead well discharge plan referral ED patient , reduce morbidity mortality , reduce unnecessary hospital visit cost . The investigator develop core set indicator face ( logical ) validity research team disability , emergency medicine , geriatric medicine expert practitioner . These expert choose piece information need include group select piece information content area . Each content area contain piece information measure unidimensional concept . The investigator go series Rasch analyse establish set information fact unidimensional form usable scale . The investigator test validity preliminary version RDDT exist hospital data use predict health outcome . Finally investigator consult panel expert determine information item , , essential miss content area . If item add RDDT . As described Preliminary Studies section , previous measure disability use person long term care ( LTC ) thus , need validate use ED . The retrospective analysis determine indicator superior measurement property use ED , plus , retrospective analysis link ED patient disability health outcome necessary external validation step . A modified RDDT use prospective phase study . As lengthy diagnostic tool neither feasible practical ED , Rasch scale useful subset scale well retain measurement property remain accurate precise . The investigator conduct randomize clinical trial ( prospective phase ) allocate patient study arm utilizing RDDT ( new tool ) compare control arm ( standard care use MOD ) determine measure accurate precise measure disability . There retrospective prospective aspect multi-methodological interdisciplinary study .</detailed_description>
