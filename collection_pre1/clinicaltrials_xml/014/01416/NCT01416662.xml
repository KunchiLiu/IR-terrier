	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Been Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine ability cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) predict occurrence early ( first 2 course ) severe hematological toxicity ( grade 3 4 ) , induced gemcitabine hydrochloride patient resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Secondary - To determine ability CDA predict occurrence severe non-hematological toxicity ( grade 3 4 ) , early ( first 2 course ) , follow course , induced gemcitabine hydrochloride . - To determine ability CDA predict occurrence severe hematological toxicity ( grade 3 4 ) course , induced gemcitabine hydrochloride . - To determine impact CDA status gemcitabine hydrochloride pharmacokinetics ratio gemcitabine hydrochloride/dFdU metabolization . - To study genotype phenotype CDA gene . - To identify new mutation CDA gene . - To evaluate relationship CDA status global survival . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Within 8 week resection , patient receive adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacogenetic biomarker study . Some patient may undergo blood sample collection pharmacokinetic study . After completion study , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
