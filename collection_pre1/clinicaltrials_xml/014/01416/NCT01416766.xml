	<detailed_description>This project develop test low-cost approach use health information technology ( HIT ) , aim improve effectiveness cost-effectiveness care chronic health condition amenable home self-monitoring , easy disseminate . In contrast many HIT-based intervention , investigator utilize commercial , off-the-shelf technology rather custom , expensive HIT . The investigator use hypertension control among person diabetes test case document need improve control hypertension high-risk population study estimate improve hypertension control diabetes cost-effective medical intervention possibly even cost-saving direct health care dollar . This high-value return investment important encouraging adoption , expansion , dissemination HIT innovation . Our intervention involve recruit 400 person diabetes uncontrolled hypertension receive care Reliant Medical Group ( RMG - formerly call Fallon Clinic ) . MODIFICATION ( 2/13 ) - Due small anticipated number eligible person low enrollment , expand eligibility include `` prediabetics '' . Half randomly assign receive automate blood pressure ( BP ) monitor capable uploading reading computer , plus instruction connect monitor home clinic upload information popular free commercial personal health record ( PHR ) system . These blood pressure data PHR transfer automatically RMG 's electronic health record ( EHR ) system alert RMG 's exist team care management nurse . Subjects whose blood pressure uncontrolled medication regimen intensified nurse accord protocol . Intervention subject receive regular outreach call care management nurse blood pressure remain uncontrolled periodically uploading blood pressure reading . After one year , investigator compare outcome control intervention subject . Our primary outcome change mean blood pressure proportion subject control blood pressure . The investigator also measure range secondary outcome include cost intervention , medication utilization , variety patient-reported outcome . Furthermore , investigator interview observe study subject care provider gain good understanding factor affect uptake use intervention . The investigator examine continue use intervention formal study participation end also measure uptake intervention control subject offer delayed entry end formal study . Lastly , investigator compare study finding , recent study use HIT improve hypertension control develop set best practice recommendation future effort area .</detailed_description>
