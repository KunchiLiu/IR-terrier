	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) major public health problem world-wide . CHF carry devastate prognosis resembles type malignant cancer . Its incidence rise steadily 0.02 per 1000 population per year age 25 34 year 11.6 age 85 year old . Despite substantial improvement management disease , prognosis remain poor especially advanced stage disease . About half patient diagnose CHF die within 4 year diagnosis . With increase number patient CHF refer hospital primary health care , demand expanded service primary health care increase . Caring patient CHF often involve number physical , medical , behavioral , psychological social factor , require appropriate attention aspect care , pharmacological non-pharmacological . Educating patient CHF treatment consequence CHF show improve self-management behavior . For patient CHF , self-management plan include monitoring symptom fatigue shortness breath , daily weighing , know sign deterioration appear , report change health care provider . In patient CHF , prognosis worsens considerably malnutrition develop . Mortality 18 month unselected patient CHF cardiac cachexia diagnose high 50 % compare non-cachectic patient study population . In addition , amount proteinuria know related atherosclerosis burden disease severity regard lot disease entity . The atherosclerosis score also probably modifiable life style intervention educational program . CHF also activate neurohormone natriuretic peptide , among brain natriuretic peptide world-wide use . Summarized , study , estimate effect CHF education self-management program , parameter adopt include blood brain natriuretic peptide albumin level , atherosclerosis score , proteinuria , renal function , change life quality , leave ventricular ejection fraction , cardiac outcome . In Taiwan , far , investigator n't kind CHF education self-care system . The investigator hypothesize patient heart failure management program promote self-management mean intensive education , edema index-assistance , telephone follow-up improve functional status quality life , well biomarkers CHF , leave ventricular systolic function , proteinuria nutritional status .</detailed_description>
