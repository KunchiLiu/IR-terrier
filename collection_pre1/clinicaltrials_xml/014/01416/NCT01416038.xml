	<brief_summary>This phase 1-2 study determine safety immunogenicity profile DPX-Survivac , therapeutic vaccine co-administered regimen low dose oral cyclophosphamide . DPX-Survivac treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . Immunotherapy novel way treat cancer target immune system destroy tumor cell . Many different therapeutic vaccine evaluate phase 1 , 2 , even phase 3 trial . Much learn principle apply immune-based therapy specifically type patient may likely mount effective immune response . Cancer vaccine may greatest impact earlier disease course situation minimal residual disease . ImmunoVaccine Technologies Inc. ( Immunovaccine ) develop therapeutic vaccine various solid cancer base patented vaccine delivery enhancement system . Immunovaccine 's vaccine formulation , term DepoVax , lipid-based formulation create enhance speed , strength duration immune response . Immunovaccine 's hypothesis immune enhancement property formulation result co-delivery antigen adjuvant create depot effect . The peptide antigens include DPX-Survivac design target Survivin , protein over-expressed many cancer type , include epithelial ovarian cancer . This study begin phase 1 safety cohort study ; least 15 non-randomized patient enrol open-label dose find study . The study progress directly 2:1 randomize , double-blinded phase 2 portion study . The phase 2 placebo control efficacy study , enrol approximately 250 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1-2 Study Cancer Vaccine Treat Patients With Advanced Stage Ovarian , Fallopian Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment ovarian cancer aggressive debulking surgery follow chemotherapy . Ovarian carcinoma one chemosensitive solid tumor early stage patient responsive treatment . However , despite improvement standard treatment past three decade , almost patient advanced stage disease presentation relapse , average progression free survival 16-18 month . When residual recurrent disease manifest , resistance chemotherapy often prohibit curative therapy . Therefore , still significant unmet need treat ovarian cancer patient . Treatment DPX-Survivac patient late-stage ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer complete initial chemotherapy treatment successful debulking surgery . The phase 1 dose find study administer 3 dos DPX-Survivac without accompany low dose oral cyclophosphamide . The phase 2 , placebo control , study administer DPX-Survivac placebo accompany low dose cyclophosphamide placebo . PHASE 1 - non-randomized , open-label , dose-finding study - least 15 subject - three safety cohort ( list table ) - safety immunogenicity finding determine dosage phase 2 PHASE 2 - 2:1 randomize , double-blinded , placebo control study - approximately 250 subject - two arm ( 1 ) Experimental : DPX-Survivac ( injection ) low dose cyclophosphamide ( oral ) ( 2 ) Control : placebo injection oral placebo</detailed_description>
