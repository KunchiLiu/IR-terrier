	<brief_title>Cognitive REmediation After Trauma Exposure Trial = CREATE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) prevalent service member return Operation Enduring Freedom , Operation Iraqi Freedom , Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) . Virtually individual suffer TBI ( TBI ) acute cognitive effect , significant number persistent symptom . A large number individual PTSD also report problem cognition , however , little known treatment cognitive complaint either condition less known cognitive complaint individual co-occurring TBI PTSD . There preclinical evidence cholinergic catecholaminergic neurotransmitter system play important role cognitive function healthy individual well mTBI and/or PTSD . We propose evaluate efficacy two pharmacotherapies , one predominantly augment cholinergic function ( galantamine [ GAL ] ) one augment predominantly catecholaminergic function ( methylphenidate [ MPH ] ) , reduce cognitive symptom individual TBI and/or PTSD . Using double-blind , randomize , placebo control design , 159 individual TBI and/or PTSD persistent cognitive complaint randomize receive galantamine 12 mg BID , methylphenidate 20 mg BID , placebo 12 week . The primary objective ass efficacy galantamine methylphenidate reduce cognitive complaint patient PTSD and/or TBI . Secondary objective assess extent non-cognitive distress responds galantamine methylphenidate , assess effect galantamine methylphenidate cognitive performance .</detailed_description>
