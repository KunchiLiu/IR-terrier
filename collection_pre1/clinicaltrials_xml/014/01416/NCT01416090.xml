	<detailed_description>Syndactyly relatively common congenital abnormality hand occur approximately 1 2500 live birth ( 1 ) . It simple , mean skin soft tissue share , complex , mean bone nail part share . In case , fact enough skin surround two finger segment utilized cover two separate finger . This also proven simple geometry . Therefore , always teach resident explain numerous patient ' family addition skin graft require proper syndactyly release . Without , skin flap would tight , cause necrosis significant scarring along finger particularly web space , cause unsatisfactory functional cosmetic result require revision . Full thickness skin graft ( FTSG ) usually utilized procedure come cost . An additional incision , therefore scar , make groin arm hand . The skin graft usually slightly different color hyperpigments ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) place hand hair growth would normally present finger . These create cosmetic issue patient get old . In addition , skin graft quite cumbersome utilize tight area small finger small child . It definitely add time anesthesia method sew small suture show efficacious . Whereas release simple syndactyly may take 30-60 minute , suture skin graft skin flap usually take one half time long addition . Further , skin graft require immobilization special bandage technique avoid graft loss . One final disadvantage full thickness skin graft implicate occurrence web creep , post-operative scar finger decrease amount web space originally obtain ( 4,6 ) . These often require surgical procedure ( Percival &amp; Sykes ) . Over last 20 year , resurgence attempt treat syndactyly without skin graft ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 3 , 6 ) . All technique include significant defatting subcutaneous tissue way back web space effect decrease circumference digit . Different dorsal metacarpal flap describe well , include local island pedicle flap use web commissure ( 3 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) . In addition , show leave flap slightly open , 2mm , secondary intention heal creates good scar child increase sign web creep flexion contracture ( 5 ) . Combining three technique lead technical ability syndactyly release without need skin graft . Proven benefit lack donor scar , lack pigment hairy graft site , decrease operative time . However , incidence web creep , flexion lateral contracture , reoperation rate final cosmetic result proven well bad , one compare similar patient . All study date instead review result use particular technique require skin graft . If comparison make , use historical data already publish .</detailed_description>
