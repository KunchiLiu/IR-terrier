	<brief_summary>This Phase 3b , multicenter , international study conduct 2 part . Upon completion placebo-controlled period ( Part 1 ) , participant option enrol 2-year open-label extension ( Part 2 ) . Part 1 : The primary objective study investigate whether treatment natalizumab slow accumulation disability relate relapse participant secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) . The secondary objective Part 1 study determine proportion participant consistent improvement Timed 25-Foot Walk ( T25FW ) , change participant-reported ambulatory status measure 12-item MS Walking Scale ( MSWS-12 ) , change manual ability base ABILHAND Questionnaire , impact natalizumab participant-reported quality life use Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Physical ( MSIS-29 Physical ) , change whole brain volume end study Week 24 use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) proportion participant experience progression disability measure individual physical Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) system score . Part 2 : The primary objective Part 2 study evaluate safety profile natalizumab participant SPMS . The secondary objective Part 2 study investigate long-term disability ( base clinical patient-reported assessment ) participant SPMS receive natalizumab treatment approximately 4 year assess change brain volume T2 lesion volume .</brief_summary>
