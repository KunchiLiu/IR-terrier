	<brief_summary>This study compare clinical , self- report cost outcome child adolescent treat pulmonary valve implantation , percutaneous versus open surgical technique . Since cardiac surgery child adolescent affect whole family , experience patient closest relative record analysed separately . Cost may important factor choice technology ( 1 ) . Hence , present study also aim compare saving cost , percutaneous versus open technique , related individual , family society . 1.2 Research question 1 . Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation open heart surgery ; patient ' close relative narrative experience 2 . Is difference patient closest relative report outcome , measure health relate quality life , patient congenital pulmonary disease event , 1 , 3 , 6 12 month percutaneous intervention versus open heart surgery approach ? 3 . What relationship patient report outcomes clinical outcome , 1 , 3 , 6 12 month treatment ? 4 . Are savings cost related individual family society two technique ?</brief_summary>
