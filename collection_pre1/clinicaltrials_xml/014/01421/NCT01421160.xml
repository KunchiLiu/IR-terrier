	<brief_title>Regulating Urine pH Levels Alleviate Chronic Joint Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY SYNOPSIS / Literature Review Inflammation local immune response injury , infection foreign molecule . Notwithstanding provoking cause , inflammation think evolved adaptive response restore tissue homeostasis . The local inflammatory response cause acidosis pain associate induced acidosis various origins - diet , injury , exercise , stress , medication , disease state age . Inflammatory degenerative joint disease major cause chronic pain . In general , inflammatory cause ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , RA ) common young individual , degenerative cause ( e.g . osteoarthritis , OA ) often see elderly [ Schaible et al , 2009 ] . Pain perception extremely complex perceive connection note level pain felt individual bodily fluid hydrogen ion concentration , i.e . pH ; oral water-soluble alkaline component contain K , Ca , Mg Cl salt use reduce bodily fluid tissue acid concentration . Urine pH consider reflect bodily acid-base balance directly related dietary acid-base load [ Welch et al , 2008 ] . Currently , potassium citrate ( Kcit , 45-60 mEq daily ) widely use urology treatment patient uric acid cystine stone [ Sterrett et al , 2008 ; Spivacow et al , 2010 ] . Aside use Kcit treatment kidney stone , isolated report anti-inflammatory hypoalgesic system effect Kcit . Alkalinization diet alone also effective remove uric acid body , though effect urine pH level weaker [ Kanbara , Hakoda &amp; Seyama , 2010 ] . It consider alkalinization urine reflect body fluid alkalinization . This perceived effect increase bone density , improved muscle function , speculative decrease insulin resistance [ Pizzorno , Frassetto &amp; Katzinger , 2010 ] . Research Project Question/Theme The investigator aim determine causal relationship regulate urine pH level 7.0 7.5 decrease chronic joint pain . The investigator hypothesize maintenance alkaline urinary pH result decrease personally report level chronic joint pain use citrate treatment regimen . Project Design : Subjects recruit local physician 's practice , primarily TTUHSC clinic , Principal Investigator Co-Investigators . Subjects report presence joint pain six month , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , eligible participation . Any Adverse Events ( AEs ) monitor Principal Investigator Co-Investigators , report Study Coordinator IRB . Subjects study identify Principal Investigator Co-Investigators local TTUHSC clinic . After subject agrees participate informed consent give , study coordinator explain study procedure baseline measurement assess use diagnostic imaging lab test . All subject ask obtain and/or provide copy recent X-rays MRI affect joint lab test ( CBC , liver kidney panel ) . Images test must recent take within past 6 month enrollment study . After baseline measurement establish , instruction urine alkalinization treatment regimen distribute subject treatment solution obtain . This treatment vary person person easily modify . Subjects measure , report , take treatment 6 month . While treatment , subject ask report and/or measure follow value daily basis : - Report much treatment take day - Measure urine pH level daily 10 A.M. use pH strip - Rate pain 3X daily use modified pain rating scale - Report daily food beverage intake - Visit physician investigator monthly follow-up visit review pain rating pH value note past month Analysis : Using SAS System , investigator calculate minimum number enrol subject require achieve statistical result 21 . The investigator estimate minimum number 16 subject must complete study order achieve sufficient , statistically powerful result . In order ensure successful completion statistical data analysis , investigator decide enroll twice minimum number subject require ( 16x2 ) enroll total 32 subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Presence joint pain perceive inflammatory noninflammatory origin six month . More specifically : Subjects osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee prefer inclusion study . Subjects joint pain history include pursuant approval Dr. Miller Dr. Pema . 2 . Age 21 80 year old otherwise good health ( exclude joint pain ) . 3 . Able understand comply assign urine alkalinization instruction . 4 . Has work reliable telephone number continue contact necessary study . 5 . Ability obtain Xrays affect joint . Imaging painful joint necessary beginning study baseline consideration ; image last 6 month available , new image would necessary . 6 . Ability obtain lab test ( Complete Blood Count Comprehensive Metabolic Panel ) obtain documentation recent lab test take within one month prior enrollment . 7 . Ability obtain lab test 3 6 month participation study . 1 . Presence joint pain know joint osseous change . 2 . Pregnant lactate woman enrol study . 3 . Positive medical history : Diabetes Neuropathies Gout Psychiatric diseases condition , include anxiety , depression , PTSD , distress Psychosocial abnormality Dementia memory disturbance Alcoholism substance abuse Renal failure and/or abnormal renal function ( kidney disease dysfunction ) . Specifically , Creatinine ( Creat ) value 1.2mg/dL Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) value 22mg/dL consider abnormal . No history cardiovascular disease , intestinal angina arrhythmia No history sodium restriction Pt . take medication produce pain angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor Statins ( Lisinopril , Quinapril , Ramipril ) 4 . Does reliable telephone communication . 5 . Does ability obtain Xray ability obtain documentation recent Xray within last six month . 6 .
