	<detailed_description>In prospective study outpatient department three large hospital Ho Chi Minh City , Viet Nam , determine early diagnostic sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value two NS1 diagnostic test severe dengue case . The study intend develop prognostic algorithm early identification severe dengue case . Routine demographic , haematological biochemical laboratory marker utilized derive prognostic algorithm clinically-useful guiding patient triage intervention . We hope discover evaluate new early biomarkers severe dengue evaluate candidate host response molecules virological marker prognostic value . We plan understand phylogeography DENV super-urban setting HCMC . We use genome scale sequence DENV together geospatial information residential address patient well understand transmission dynamic space time high transmission super-urban district HCMC thereby identify opportunity public health intervention .</detailed_description>
