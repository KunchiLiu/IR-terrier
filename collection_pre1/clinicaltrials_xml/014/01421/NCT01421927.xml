	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( Allo-SCT ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) remain controversial topic high risk relapse significant transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) . In effort reduce TRM , allogeneic transplant MM perform reduced-intensity conditioning regimen . In condition , TRM usually range 10 20 % . However , reduce intensity conditioning invariably increase incidence relapse 45 60 % . As consequence , post-transplant strategy reduce incidence relapse reduced-intensity Allo-SCT consider evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide significant clinical activity patient relapse refractory MM patient relapse Allo-SCT . The mechanisms action involve immunomodulation , anti-angiogenesis activity , direct anti tumor activity effect microenvironment . So far , experience lenalidomide Allo-SCT limit patient progressive disease . In patient , response observe transient median progression-free survival less one year . Lenalidomide use maintenance therapy patient persistent rather progressive disease might better approach . Lenalidomide interesting Allo-SCT setting also recent study focus immunological property suggest molecule could stimulate graft versus myeloma effect . First , demonstrate vitro lenalidomide inhibit proliferation suppressor function regulatory T cell . Secondly , clinical study use lenalidomide salvage therapy Allo-SCT demonstrate increase activate T cell NK cell . Finally , case report describe patient 's response lenalidomide associate development acute graft versus host disease . Taken together , data suggest patient MM persistent disease reduced-intensity Allo-SCT might benefit post-transplant maintenance strategy lenalidomide direct anti-tumor effect stimulation graft versus myeloma effect . The primary objective study evaluate safety strategy .</detailed_description>
