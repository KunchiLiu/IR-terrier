	<brief_summary>Many people worldwide receive monovalent adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine . However , little known safety vaccine , particularly beyond first week vaccination . This study combine data well-established immunization registry Manitoba data hospitalization physician record , examine safety vaccine six month period post-vaccination . Studies vaccine safety important public 's perception safety vaccine major role uptake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study examine safety H1N1 vaccine administer Manitoba second wave pandemic ( Oct 2009-Mar 2010 ) describe age sex specific age standardize incidence rate certain vaccination adverse event vaccinate population first 6 month follow-up compare rate non-vaccinated population general Manitoba population . Study design The propose study retrospective analysis population base cohort subject whose vaccination status health event H1N1 vaccination record various Manitoba database . All H1N1 vaccinate unvaccinated individual eligible include study population . There exclusion criterion . The list specific adverse event special interest ( AESIs ) include : anaphylaxis , Bell 's palsy , convulsion , demyelination , encephalitis , Guillain-Barr√© syndrome , neuritis , vasculitis various pregnancy outcome . Vaccinated individual identify use Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System ( MIMS ) . Unvaccinated individual identify use Population Registry . AESIs clinically relevant information determine use hospital , physician claim DPIN databases . The primary statistical analysis comparison overall age specific rate deaths AESIs vaccinate cohort relative non-vaccinated cohort . The two cohort match age ( month year birth ) , sex postal code residence . The analysis stratify specific subgroup : ( e.g . pregnant woman , person immune suppress autoimmune disorder ) . The observed number event determine date first vaccination subject match control first occurrence specific event . Information event person derive medical claim hospitalization database . The person year risk calculate date first vaccination first occurrence specific event , emigration Manitoba , 6 month vaccination . Incidence rate ratio 95 % confidence interval calculate compare standardized incidence rate vaccinate cohort match non vaccinate cohort . In addition , observed number death AESIs total vaccinate population specific subgroup ( ) compare expect number base age sex specific rate general Manitoba population . Similar match cohort component , observed number event determine vaccinated individual date first vaccination first occurrence specific event , person year risk calculate date first vaccination first occurrence specific event , emigration Manitoba , 6 month vaccination . The background rate target event calculate utilizing information mortality , physician claim hospitalization database total population Manitoba period 2004 2008 . Since risk event low , calculate age sex specific rate base five year data increase stability rate . The expected number event calculate multiply person year risk age sex specific background rate target event . Standardized incidence ratio ( SIRs ) mortality ratio ( SMRs ) calculate number observed event number expect event , 95 % confidence interval . To assess absolute burden eventual excess observe number event absolute difference observe expected number event certain AESIs also calculate .</detailed_description>
