	<brief_summary>The basic nerve deficit Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) lead low urinary tract symptom frequency , urgency urge urinary incontinence . Lower urinary tract symptom tend occur advanced stage PD . In over-65 year old age group , 1 % men suffer disease , also prone development benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) consequent associate low urinary tract dysfunction . Similarly 65-year age group develop spontaneous overactive bladder prevalence 30 % men woman . The urologic disorder exceedingly devastate reduce quality life individual due low urinary tract symptom ultimate urinary incontinence high proportion patient . While attempt pharmacologic treatment partially satisfactory many patient intolerant oral drug . Botulinum-A neurotoxin ( BTX-A ) show pilot trial quite effective reduce overactive bladder symptom specifically beneficial wide-variety neurogenic bladder cause activity . The treatment procedure inject detrusor muscle bladder BTX-A quite simple , impose significant risk patient , perform office urologic procedure . This pilot clinical trial intend demonstrate safety efficacy low-dose Botox-A injection bladder improve urinary symptom 20 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy botulinumA Toxin ( BotoxA ) Treatment Neurogenic Bladder Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label pilot study evaluate safety efficacy intra-detrusor injection botulinum-A toxin ( BTX-A ) 20 male female patient Parkinson 's disease neurogenic overactive bladder without urinary incontinence , without evidence significant urinary retention ( &gt; 25 % bladder capacity void ) . Patients invited participate base upon subjective symptom uncontrolled low urinary tract urgency , frequency urinary incontinence . Only patient Hoehn Yahr Stage IV well ( UPDRS equivalent ) consider . Patients must try anti-muscarinic agent fail improve intolerant pharmacologic agent . Oral anti-muscarinic medication discontinue two week prior urodynamics test treatment visit . At baseline urinary symptom score obtain use The King 's Health Questionnaire ( KHQ , validate score system urinary symptom ) AUA Urinary Symptom Score . In addition 3-day fluid intake urinary outflow time void diary submit time test treatment well follow-up visit . After sign informed consent meeting inclusion exclusion criterion , patient test urodynamic study determine current low urinary tract neurophysiologic functioning . A `` free-flow '' urinary flow rate post-void residual urine volume test perform well fill cystometrogram pressure/flow measurement . Patients evidence outlet obstruction ( high pressure/low flow ) exclude study . Only patient post-void residual urine volume less equal 25 % total bladder volume void include . No catheter measurement device attach body time initial free urinary flow post-void urine volume measurement . A repeat pressure/flow determination perform urodynamics cystometrogram . After qualification proceed , patient transfer adjoin cystoscopy suite . Pre-procedure oral sedation analgesia give . Subjects undergo cystoscopy topical lidocaine anesthesia undergo 25-gauge needle injection BTX-A . BTX-A treatment participant limit total dose 100 unit minimum 10 20 location . Any patient unable void procedure receive indwell catheter 24 hour . Patients contact telephone within 24-48 hour procedure safety assessment . Follow-up clinic visit evaluation occur 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 9 month . A 3-day voiding diary , King 's Health Questionnaire , AUA Symptom Score sheet Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) Questionnaire collect follow-up visit . Incontinence document diary . Uroflowmetry post-void residual volume also assess follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>â€¢ Male female subject , 50 85 year age . Patients diagnose Parkinson 's disease prior low urinary tract symptom . Documentation low volume desire void and/or unstable detrusor contraction without incontinence cystometrogram . Voiding diary consistent overactive bladder Written inform consent obtain . Ability follow study instruction likely complete require visit . Written authorization Use Release Health Research Study Information obtain . Subject minimum moderate severity/stage disease , Hoehn Yahr stage IV le ( UPDRS equivalent ) Usual customary medication allow Uncontrolled clinically significant medical condition condition evaluation Known allergy sensitivity component study medication . Concurrent participation another investigational drug device study participation within 60 day period time prior study New anticholinergic medication . Should discontinue antimuscarinic medication 14 day prior injection . Treatment botulinum toxin serotype prior enrollment study ( applicable ) . Any medical condition may put subject increase risk exposure BTXA include diagnose myasthenia gravis , EatonLambert syndrome , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , disorder might interfere neuromuscular function ( applicable ) . Evidence alcohol , drug abuse relevant neuropsychiatric condition ( applicable ) Urinary tract infection Significant BPH evidence severe bladder trabeculation Greater 50 % postvoid residual urine volume Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study .</criteria>
