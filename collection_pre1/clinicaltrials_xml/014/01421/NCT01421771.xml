	<brief_summary>Hypertension major cause cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality . Although study general population demonstrate continuous reduction CV risk mmHg drop systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , multiple observational study conduct hemodialysis ( HD ) patient demonstrate patient mild moderate hypertension may decrease mortality compare normal blood pressure ( BP ) . The investigator recently report among HD patient , routine pre-dialysis BP value meet Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) guideline ( &lt; 140/90 mm Hg ) increase mortality compare patient mild moderate hypertension . However , observational study include untreated patient low normal BP may reflect significant cardiac disease comorbid condition . In set reduced vascular compliance impaired autoregulation , aggressive BP lowering may decrease coronary cerebral perfusion . Thus , unclear aggressive BP lower harmful beneficial . A well-designed randomize control trial ( RCT ) need answer important question . Prior conduct full-scale RCT prudent conduct pilot study assess feasibility inform design former . The investigator propose conduct pilot RCT prevalent cohort HD patient assess safety feasibility treat patient low ( 110-140 mmHg ) standard ( 155-165 ) mm Hg pre-dialysis BP target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mortality morbidity among hemodialysis ( HD ) patient remain unacceptably high , thus compel need improve clinical outcome . Accordingly , National Kidney Foundation 's Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Improvement program ( KDOQI ) publish guideline call pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 140 mmHg HD patient . However , evidence support guideline grade weak since largely extrapolate general population . Studies general population demonstrate continuous reduction cardiovascular risk mmHg drop systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , extend level past consider `` normal '' . The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ) study show decrease composite outcome CV event CV mortality among non-diabetic patient high risk cardiovascular event target SBP &lt; 120 mmHg . It reasonable postulate intensive control BP may beneficial HD patient , many way resemble patient SPRINT except progressed end stage renal disease . Thus , timely propose conduct RCT intensive versus standard control blood pressure HD patient . The investigator recognize observational study suggest mortality among HD patient may increase among patient meet current KDOQI guideline . Unidentified confounders may contribute surprising finding . The conclusion reach observational study HD patient often refute randomize control trial ( RCTs ) . Therefore , RCT need determine pre-dialysis SBP &lt; 140 mmHg specify KDOQI appropriate target . Prior begin full-scale-RCT , imperative conduct pilot study demonstrate safety efficacy inform design full-scale study . The pilot study design answer follow question : 1 . What estimate recruitment , accrual retention rate ? 2 . What proportion patient arm achieve maintain SBP within assign target investigator achieve equal great 10mmHg separation average SBP two arm ? 3 . What anticipate adverse serious adverse event rate within intensive standard arm ? 4 . What end point use full-scale trial ? 5 . What blood pressure ( BP ) measurement e.g. , routine dialysis unit BP ( RDUBPM ) , standardized dialysis unit BP ( SDUBPM ) , standardize home BP ( HBPM ) ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) guide therapy ? Although SDUBPM , HBPM ABPM may powerful RDUBP predict clinical outcome , long term adherence technique demonstrate . Specific Aims 1 . Establish procedure SDUBPM , HBPM ABPM web-based data entry . 2 . Recruit randomize patient two treatment arm target pre-dialysis SDUSBPM value &lt; 140 &lt; 160 mmHg measure recruitment , accrual , dropout rate arm . 3 . Assess feasibility attain maintain target degree SBP separation achieve one year intervention . 4 . Measure adherence rate obtain protocol SDUBPM , HBPM ABPM one-year intervention . 5 . Assess safety treat participant study 's SBP target measure occurrence rate CVD non-CVD morbidity mortality adverse serious adverse event arm . 6 . Compare difference change leave ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) , aortic pulse wave velocity ( APWV ) , aortic distensibility , respectively , two study arm . 7 . Conduct statistical analysis inform design full-scale study .</detailed_description>
