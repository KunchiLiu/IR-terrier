	<brief_summary>OVERVIEW : - Thromboembolisms represent serious fear complication hospitalize patient . - Several factor make ICU patient population increase risk venous thromboembolism . - A high incidence thromboembolic event start emerge recent medical literature burn patient . - Actual guideline thromboprophylaxis burn care patient base multiple non-burn patient trial . - Burn patient physiology radically different general ward hospitalize patient - Since actual chemical thromboprophylaxis evaluate burn patient , interest ass efficacy patient severe burn . - Hence , pharmacokinetic characterization heparin ( well accept mode thromboprophylaxis ) burn patient could guide future quality care subclass patient . Our proposal base conviction anti-Xa activity low-molecular-weight heparin burn patient correlate level describe prevent thromboembolic event general hospitalize population . The investigator aim : 1 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics low-molecular-weight heparin ( enoxaparin ) , anti-Xa level severely burn patient receive thromboprophylaxis . 2 . To determine correlation antithrombotic activity heparins different metabolic phase thermally injured patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) take prevalent place medical literature past decade . In attempt decrease impact hospitalize patient , multiple trial try good define frequency consequence broad range patient . The difference sub population ill individual influence greatly occurrence venous thrombotic event ( VTE ) . Critically ill patient predispose VTEs . The nature disease may important impact risk DVT . Mechanical ventilation , central line placement , surgery , vasopressor immobilization reality ICU patient . They contribute enhanced chance thromboembolic complication population , either venous stasis ( immobilization ) , endothelial injury ( surgery… ) hypercoagulability . Trauma patient represent subclass critical care patient high incidence DVT . It evaluate high 44,1 % even patient thrombotic prophylaxis low-dose unfractioned heparin . Burn patient also increase risk deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Recent prospective trial burn patient describe incidence thromboembolic complication range 6 60 % . Autopsy evaluation also favor elevated incidence thrombotic event thermally injured patient ( 37 60 % ) . At present time , trial evaluate efficacy pharmacologic method use thromboprophylaxis burn patient . Comparative efficacy different patient population ( include thermally injured patient ) never undertook . Thus , investigator question adequacy present thromboprophylactic measure burn patient ? Are actual method DVT PE prophylaxis sufficient severe burn ? The physiology moderate severe burn make u believe . In early post burn period , massive fluid reanimation initiate . The Starling force destabilize favor increase capillary leak interstitial space . The net effect increase free water interstitium formation important edema . The distance epithelium vascular space potentially increase . Furthermore , central intravascular compartment individual become difficult access . This lead u reconsider efficiency subcutaneous route . In case severe accumulation interstitial fluid , subcutaneous administration medication lead desire therapeutic effect ? The investigator plan compare level anti-Xa level 3 patient population : severely burn patient ( &gt; 20 % ) , medical ICU patient general medical ward patient .</detailed_description>
