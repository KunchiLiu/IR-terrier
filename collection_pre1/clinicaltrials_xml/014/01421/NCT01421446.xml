	<detailed_description>Cognitive decline one primary symptom triad Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ( NPH ) . Neuropsychological measure demonstrate effective diagnosis NPH , assess efficacy treatment intervention . Hence , neuropsychological assessment critical component assessment presence NPH . Specifically , measure attention/concentration , fine motor skill , executive functioning ability , speed processing memory find useful assessment NPH treatment thereof . Neuropsychologists typically find large hospital , academic center urban location . Neuropsychologists represent rural low population center . At present time , cognitive assessment frequently limit Mini Mental Status Examination . Furthermore , neuropsychological test expensive patient , give insurance constraint . Finally , standardized test battery use different center treat patient population . The creation standard battery could use NPH center would promote research collaboration . A computerized neuropsychological test battery develop Umea , Sweden specific goal use test consider sensitive cognitive profile observe NPH . The battery develop JAVA Adobe Flash make platform independent ( Runs Mac , Windows Linux ) . The test battery administer touch screen display , test present animation audio instruction . Before real test trail administer , subject give practice trial auditory visual feedback . For American version test , auditory stimulus translate recorded English .</detailed_description>
