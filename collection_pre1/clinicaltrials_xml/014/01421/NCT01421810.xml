	<brief_summary>Women polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) unwanted facial male-patterned body hair , irregular menstrual period , menstrual period excess body weight , infertility . It also result elevate androgen level testosterone . In woman PCOS , majority excess androgen produce ovary . However , unknown whether ovary fully active early puberty . The purpose study determine ovary contribute production male hormone body different stage puberty , good understood female excess androgen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adolescent hyperandrogenemia represent forerunner adult PCOS . Because adrenarche lead increase adrenal androgen production early puberty since early puberty associate overnight rise testosterone follow similar time course cortisol , hypothesize adrenal gland major source androgens early puberty . On hand , overnight rise testosterone may reflect ovarian response overnight increase gonadotropin secretion early puberty . However , ability ovary produce androgen ( e.g. , respond gonadotropin stimulation ) early puberty test concurrently girl . The source excess androgen production time relative contribution across puberty important understanding mechanism hyperandrogenemia individual . In addition , determination source hyperandrogenemia across puberty may clinical utility development preclinical screening test design reveal girl great risk PCOS identification potential therapeutic target prevent development .</detailed_description>
