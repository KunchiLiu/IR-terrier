The investigator would like find whether overactive adrenal gland make hormone higher girl overweight , compare overweight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Adrenal Androgens Normal Obese Girls After Suppression Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose adrenal gland predominant source early morning rise progesterone testosterone mark early puberty . Specifically , hypothesize dexamethasone administration 22:00 associate dampen progesterone testosterone rise subsequent morning normal girl . We also propose adrenal gland source excess androgen production young obese girl , dexamethasone decrease early morning testosterone progesterone level . We explore hypothesis functional adrenal hyperandrogenism , ACTH hyperresponsiveness , one mechanism underlie excess adrenal androgen production see obesity .</detailed_description>
