	<brief_summary>Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( sHPT ) common patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , include undergoing long-term haemodialysis treatment . sHPT characterize persistently elevate level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) major disturbance phosphorus calcium metabolism . When glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) fall , phosphorus clearance decrease significantly , lead phosphorus retention . The result hyperphosphatemia think one principal cause secondary hyperparathyroidism early complication patient CKD . Its diagnosis treatment crucial management patients.The treatment sHPT CKD 's patient include dietary phosphate restriction , use phosphate binder , correction hypocalcaemia , use vitamin D derivative . The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet hydrochloride may also use combination vitamin D. While majority patient control way , medical therapy always successful achieve adequate control secondary hyperparathyroidism . Oral medication ( calcimimetics , recently develop phosphate binder , active vitamin D derivatives amount high monthly cost , efficacy limitation well side-effects . HIFU may become valuable alternative treatment help control secondary hyperparathyroidism select patient present enlarged parathyroid gland ( ) visible ultrasonography , . The aim study evaluate efficacy safety HIFU treatment chronic haemodialysis patient secondary hyperparathyroidism present enlarge parathyroid gland ( ) visible ultrasonography medical therapy unsuccessful .</brief_summary>
