	<brief_title>Study CC-122 Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Effectiveness Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors , Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial enrol additional Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) subject separate cohort define MM-2 evaluate tolerability , safety preliminary efficacy CC-122 formulate capsule alone combination DEX intermittent dose schedule ( 5 7 day week ) Pomalidomide-naïve subject . Preliminary efficacy data Multiple Myeloma subject , warrant exploration CC-122 MM intermittent schedule assess dose intensity tolerability improve . Initially , patient treat oral CC-122 one month . During time , various test ( involve blood urine collection , ECGs , etc ) perform . Those whose tumor stabilize regress may continue receive treatment long benefit CC-122 . Different dose level CC-122 test dose-rising study design .</detailed_description>
