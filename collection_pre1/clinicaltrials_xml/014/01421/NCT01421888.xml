	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To study nutrition immune system problem people urea cycle disorder . - To study people urea cycle disorder healthy volunteer respond standard flu and/or hepatitis A vaccine . - To compare difference nutrition immune system people urea cycle disorder healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy male female least 2 year age able travel National Institutes Health hospital Bethesda , MD - Males female least 2 year age urea cycle disorder able travel National Institutes Health hospital Bethesda , MD . Design : For Patients urea cycle disorder : - Participants spend 2 3 day National Institutes Health hospital follow test : - A physical exam review medical history - Food log 3 day start study - Blood test - 24-hour urine collection - Resting metabolism test - DEXA scan imaging study bone body fat - Participants old enough certain task ( like dress eat ) choose follow extra test : - 24-hour metabolic room measurement - BodPod ( Registered Trademark ) study measure bone body fat - Participants may choose flu shot and/ Hepatitis A shot end study monitor check possible side effect . - Participants return within 1 3 month follow-up tests/immunizations . For Healthy Volunteers : - Participants see outpatient clinic National Institutes Health hospital 2 visit follow : - Review food log complete 3 day start study - Blood test - Participants may choose flu shot and/ Hepatitis A shot end study monitor check possible side effect . - Participants return within 1 3 month follow-up tests/immunizations . - Review second food log complete 3 day second outpatient visit</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urea cycle disorder ( UCD ) amongst frequent inborn error metabolism ( IEM ) result block hepatic disposal waste nitrogen protein catabolism . Viral infection play significant role precipitate life-threatening acute hyperammonemic crisis UCD . The recent H1N1 influenza pandemic place vulnerable population significant risk . The standard care patient routine vaccination seasonal H1N1 influenza virus . However , nutritional deficiency underlie enzymopathy may affect efficacy vaccination . Dietary management urea cycle disorder include dietary modification protein restriction . Protein energy malnutrition , essential fatty acid deficiency micronutrient deficiency due restrictive dietary management report various inborn error metabolism . In general , dietary deficiency effect immune function well document . In addition disposal waste nitrogen , urea cycle also generate arginine various biologic function . Depending site metabolic block , UCD patient risk become systemically deficient citrulline arginine , potential implication immune system . The immunomodulatory role amino acid citrulline arginine characterize context nutritional deficiency disease state cancer sepsis . Systemic infection may also deplete systemic citrulline arginine , compound underlying deficiency UCD . Cells immune system direct relationship urea cycle : urea cycle enzyme arginosuccinate synthetase ( ASS ) , arginosuccinate lyase ( ASL ) arginase ( ARG1 ) may also components leukocyte metabolism . Overall , general specific nutritional deficiency enzymopathies affect leukocyte metabolism may potentially affect vaccine efficacy . However , immune system function experiment nature UCD remain understudied area . In protocol , clinically evaluate nutritional/metabolic immunologic state patient UCD related disorder . Routine inpatient admission last 2-3 day involve urine collection , blood drawing , radiological procedure , nutrition assessment biometrics , vaccination combine seasonal/H1N1 influenza . Follow-up outpatient appointment schedule end study period . The study objectives describe nutritional immune deficiency see , query nutrition/enzymatic/immunologic correlation patient population , describe vaccine efficacy patient population , search new gene rare family evidence unknown class UCD . The population consist patient previously evaluate NIH , physician referral , family direct study clinicaltrials.gov well National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation . All patient evaluate NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>
