	<detailed_description>Spinal manipulation ( SM ) use clinician treatment several chronic pain condition . The effectiveness different spinal manipulation target lumbar spine patient low back pain support increase number high-quality randomized clinical trials1and systematic review . Although technique show effectiveness clinical practice , clinical study solely investigated effect spinal manipulation overall report pain function underlie mechanism manipulation produce clinical effect remain largely unknown . The neurophysiologic mechanism manipulation inhibits pain , however , matter speculation still investigation . Proposed hypothesis suggest manipulation potential remove source mechanical pain induce stimulus-produced analgesia . Spinal manipulation induces sufficient force simultaneously activate superficial deep somatic mechanoreceptors , proprioceptor , nociceptors . The effect stimulation strong afferent segmental barrage spinal cord sensory neuron , capable alter pattern afferent input central nervous system inhibit central transmission pain . Other suggest mechanisms activation endogenous opiate system , alteration chemical mediator effect joint cavitation . An understanding mechanism manipulation cause hypoalgesic response subject research currently far complete . A review literature find several study explore immediate change mechanical pain sensitivity provoke spinal manipulative procedure . Mobilisation/manipulation cervical spine show provide hypoalgesic effect measure pressure pain threshold ( PPTs ) patient suffer mechanical neck pain lateral epicondylalgia . A hypoalgesic effect also demonstrate follow mobilization peripheral joint upper low limb . Mobilizations lumbar spine show produce immediate significant widespread hypoalgesic effect asymptomatic subject However , Perry et al . find unilateral mobilization lumbar spine respectively side specific response . Besides analgesic effect , present spinal manipulation reduce increase rest muscle tone spasm , monitor surface electromyography ( sEMG ) . If presence hypertonic muscle functionally associate spinal dysfunction correctable SM , would consequently follow associate high EMG level would diminish appropriate SM . In descriptive study DeVocht JW et al . find manipulation induces immediate change , usually reduction , rest EMG level patient low back pain . Herzog J report observation single dramatic decrease rest EMG activity thoracic musculature within 1 second SM . One possible segmental mechanism could manipulation may induce reflex muscle relaxation modify proprioceptive group 1 2 afferent . However , randomly control trial directly investigate effect spinal mechanical manipulation basal electromyographic activity ( BEA ) asymptomatic subject . Spinal mechanical manipulation widely use clinical manual therapy . However , mechanical thrust usually produce cavitations , whether mechanical technique produce hypoalgesic effect muscle relaxation manual technique remain untested . To elucidate physiologic mechanism associate spinal mechanical manipulation , essential investigate effect asymptomatic individual active central sensitization . In fact , recent study support use asymptomatic subject study related neurophysiological mechanism spinal manipulation . Further research therefore require clarify hypoalgesic effect muscle relaxation response spinal mechanical manipulation lumbar region asymptomatic subject .</detailed_description>
