	<brief_title>Safety Study Aztreonam Lysine Inhalation ( AZLI ) Treatment Early Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation increasingly employed therapy patient advance lung disease include cystic fibrosis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis emphysema . Despite significant short-term improvement life quality measure lung function lung transplantation , long-term outcome disappoint primarily due development condition airway fibrosis know bronchiolitis obliterans ( BO ) . It hypothesize aztreonam lysine inhalation ( AZLI ) safe effective treatment decline lung function lung transplant recipient early stage BOS . In order test hypothesis , investigator seek establish safety AZLI two-center cohort 30 lung transplant recipient BOS treat intermittently 5 consecutive study month determine treatment lead improvement stabilization lung function . The intervention involve open label treatment AZLI , addition usual transplant care , administer 3 intermittent course , 28 day , 5 month study period.. Bronchoscopy , pulmonary function testing , laboratory test perform regular basis study enrollment consistent center 's usual standard clinical care . Patients baseline screen visit , one month five month study visit.. The study take two year complete start funding . After start-up period 2 month , total 30 patient enrol 12 month across two center ( 15 patient DUMC UCLA ) . Each enrol patient complete 5 month intermittent therapy , complete baseline , month 1 month 5 visit . Over next 6 month study database finalize , statistical analysis primary secondary outcome perform lead generation either study abstract manuscript .</detailed_description>
