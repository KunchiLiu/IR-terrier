	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safety activity use pasireotide , everolimus radioembolization ( Selective Internal Radioembolization Therapy-SIRT ) treatment neuroendocrine tumor ( carcinoid ) spread liver . Both everolimus radioembolization consider `` standard care '' regimens patient liver lesion neuroendocrine tumor . However , use combination everolimus radioembolization formally evaluate set clinical trial . Pasireotide medication intend block hormonal secretion neuroendocrine tumor . This study divide two part . In first part , aim study determine safety combine everolimus , pasireotide , radioembolization . For part study investigator enroll 18 patient . After investigator confirm safety combination , conduct second part study focus evaluate effectiveness combination . For part study investigator intend enroll total 37 patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Confirmed low intermediate grade neuroendocrine tumor unresectable liver metastasis 2 . Patients must evidence disease progression Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) despite optimal octreotide therapy ( octreotide long act release [ LAR ] 30 mg every month ) 3 . Prior treatment permit include : surgery , prior systemic therapy ( ≤ 2 prior line chemotherapy ) , radiation therapy 4 . Patients must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion 5 . For patient phase Ib study , neuroendocrine tumor must involve liver lobes 6 . Minimum four week since major surgery , completion radiation , completion prior systemic anticancer therapy ( adequately recover acute toxicity prior therapy ) 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 8 . Adequate bone marrow function show : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets great equal 100 x 10^9/L Hb great 9 g/dL 9 . Adequate liver function show : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 3x ULN patient liver metastasis ) 10. International normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 ( anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin ) 11 . Patient receive low molecular weight ( LMW ) heparin stable therapeutic dose 2 week factor Xa level &lt; 1.1 U/mL enrol LMW heparin safely discontinue least 24 hour prior invasive vascular procedure ( angiography SIRsphere administration ) 12 . Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 13 . Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . 14 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day administration first study treatment . Women must lactate . Both men woman childbearing potential must advise importance use effective birth control measure course study . 15 . Signed informed consent participate study must obtain patient fully inform nature potential risk investigator ( his/her designee ) aid write information . 1 . Evidence ascites , cirrhosis , portal hypertension portal vein thrombosis 2 . Prior radiation upper abdomen 3 . Contraindications angiography 4 . Patients extensive tumor replacement liver define tumor volume &gt; 50 % liver 5 . Lung shunt ≥ 20 % 6 . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week 7 . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . 8 . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . 9 . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases 10 . Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin 11 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III IV Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function define spirometry diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air Uncontrolled diabetes define hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) &gt; 7 % despite therapy . Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection Liver disease cirrhosis severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) 12 . History liver disease cirrhosis chronic active hepatitis . Presence Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HepBSAg ) presence hepatitis C antibody . History , current alcohol misuse/abuse within past 12 month 13 . Patients presence active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection history immunocompromise , include positive HIV test result ( ELISA Western blot ) 14 . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption everolimus ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) 15 . Patients active , bleed diathesis 16 . Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Adequate contraception must use throughout trial 8 week last dose study drug , sex . ( Women childbearing potential [ WOCBP ] must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior administration pasireotide everolimus ) Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . 17 . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) WOCBP willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment 18 . Patients receive prior treatment mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . 19 .
