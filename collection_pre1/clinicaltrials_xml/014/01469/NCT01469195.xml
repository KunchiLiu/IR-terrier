	<brief_summary>During fluoroscopic imaging , diagnostic information carry primary beam . These high intensity X-rays chief hazard patient . Lower energy scatter radiation deviate direction patient . Despite typical precaution ( i.e. , hang lead shield patient operator ) , many operator expose high radiation dose ( high permit 50 miliS per year ) , long term radiation exposure may result stochastic deterministic effect . The purpose study test hypothesis non disposable radiation protection drape ( cover low part patient ) could help minimize radiation scatter patient operator . In procedure do Radial approach , large portion patient ( umbilicus ) source scatter radiation operator . This portion cover lead rectangle . A non disposable , lead drape uniform thickness insert sterile nylon bag use fluoroscopic cineangiography coronary angioplasty procedure . The lead drape cover femoral puncture site . The widths length drape 50-60cm 100 cm respectively show hinder field radiation need fluoroscopy cineangiography . ( The upper border lead patient 's umbilicus show interfere radiation field need angiography angioplasty ) . The Investigators anticipate study show significant reduction radiation exposure hence reduce radiation hazard operator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Investigators test hypothesis Phantom contain bone tissue simulate human tissue . The phantom use oncology department test radiation protocol deliver patient . Those preliminary testing show lead rectangle decrease significantly radiation scatter towards operator personnel catheterization laboratory . In chosen place whether 40 100 cm radiation beam - The Investigators detect significant reduction scatter radiation . The significant reduction experiment attribute location Investigators choose also size lead drape 100 X60 cm give large area protection . From simple geometric calculation 's understandable zone volume radiation protection become much large away lead rectangle.Patients admit elective PCI procedure ( stable ACS patient ) ask participate study sign inform consent . All procedure standard care , clean right left arm , groin sterile towel cover groin , top sterile towel lead rectangle ( insert sterile nylon bag ) put cover area umbilicus . ( In case radial approach fail femoral approach need , easy remove lead rectangle keep sterile field groin area ) . Few dosimeter use assess radiation exposure , two underneath lead apron , one top , two dosimeter operator ( two detect radiation exposure neck area ) . The Investigators approach patient long procedure time high radiation exposure anticipate ( like patient chronic total occlusion , heavily calcify tortuous coronary artery ) . In , fluoroscopy time average , long usual . A total 50 patient recruit ( base Investigators preliminary radiation test phantom result Politi et al ) . In 25 patient lead rectangle use top regular protection ( personal lead suit , lead glass shield ) , 25 patient regular protection operator .</detailed_description>
