	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best way give lyophilized black raspberry prevent oral cancer high-risk patient previously diagnose stage I-IV situ head neck cancer . Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use lyophilize black raspberry may prevent oral cancer . Studying sample oral cavity scraping , blood , urine , saliva laboratory patient receive lyophilized black raspberry may help doctor learn change occur DNA effect lyophilize back raspberry biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine adherence post-surgical head neck ( HN ) cancer patient clinical trial design expectation define tolerability potential adverse effect long-term black raspberry administration patient cohort . II . Determine effect dose delivery vehicle degree uptake black raspberry component target oral tissue post-surgical HN cancer patient time determine relationship adherence/exposure data uptake . III . Determine ability black raspberry modulate pattern gene expression within key regulatory pathway `` at-risk normal '' oral mucosa post-surgical HN cancer patient would favor inhibition , delay reversal oral carcinogenesis . IV . Determine persistence modulation `` berry-responsive gene '' 2 year follow commencement black raspberry treatment preliminarily define rate recurrence second primary oral cancer former oral cancer patient sub-cohort . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive lozenge placebo orally ( PO ) four time daily ( QID ) . ARM II : Patients receive lyophilize black raspberry lozenge PO QID . ARM III : Patients receive Saliva Substitute placebo PO QID . ARM IV : Patients receive lyophilize black raspberry Saliva Substitute PO QID . In arm , treatment continue 6 month . Oral cavity scraping , blood , urine , saliva sample collect periodically laboratory analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 1-5 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 month .</detailed_description>
