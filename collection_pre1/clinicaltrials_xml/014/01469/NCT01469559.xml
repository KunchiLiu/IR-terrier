	<brief_title>Safety Study Intranasal Insulin Type 1 Diabetes Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic polyneuropathy ( DPN ) common complication human type I II diabetes mellitus , identify 50 % diabetic subject regardless age type diabetes . As global burden diabetes heightens due epidemic type II diabetes , prevalence DPN concurrently rise . Clinical feature DPN include loss sensation , propensity towards traumatic wound formation , neuropathic pain , motor weakness fall . At time specific therapy arrest reverse DPN . Previous work demonstrate absolute reduction plasma insulin level Type I diabetes also type II diabetic . At present , therapy neuropathic pain associate DPN available , target symptom relief partially effective . Intranasal insulin administration novel approach treatment diabetic polyneuropathy ( DPN ) base robust basic science research . Intranasal insulin currently study condition complete Phase II subject cognitive impairment mild Alzheimer 's disease . Intranasal administration insulin result increase penetration cerebrospinal fluid peripheral nervous system avoid systemic absorption . Lack systemic absorption result maintenance normal blood glucose level normal healthy subject . The objective current study follow : 1 . Primary : To determine safety tolerability intranasal insulin delivery subject type 1 diabetes DPN . 2 . Secondary : To determine whether intranasal insulin efficacious slow progression DPN . This study design double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , controlled-dose escalation phase 2 pilot clinical trial . The duration study subject 11 week 6 week blind study treatment . The study treatment either active study drug ( Novolin Toronto insulin ) placebo ( normal saline ) . The phase study follow : 1 . Screening phase ( 3 week ) : Potential subject undergo screen procedure determine eligibility . Procedures include informed consent , review medical history , anthropometric measure , vital sign , physical examination ( include neurological assessment ) , bloodwork . 2 . Baseline phase ( 2 week ) : Eligibility subject confirm subject commence collection protocol-specified blood glucose daily basis . Nerve conduction test corneal confocal microscopy complete prior start next phase . 3 . Treatment phase ( 6 week ) : Subjects commence study treatment low protocol-specified dose . If assign Novolin Toronto insulin , 20 international unit ( IU ) twice daily ( BID ) . Return visit clinic occur every two week dose escalation . The dose increase 40 IU BID , 80 IU BID . Subjects assign normal saline receive volume equivalent total volume give subject take insulin . Visits treatment phase also include safety bloodwork , serial blood glucose measurement every 15 minute 2 hour period , review hypoglycemia , adverse event , change concomitant medication , assessment neuropathy , questionnaire , teaching , study treatment accountability/compliance assessment . The study complete 11 week time period , immediately prior second nerve conduction study corneal confocal microscopy complete . The study protocol design monitor hypoglycemia throughout baseline treatment period subject . Any severe hypoglycemia significant increase hypoglycemia ( &gt; 30 % compare baseline phase ) review Investigator case-by-case basis determine continuation study treatment . Any subject undergoes discontinuation study treatment continue follow 11 week ( without study treatment ) .</detailed_description>

Presence untreated B12 deficiency . 3 . Presence paraproteinemia , detect use serum protein electrophoresis minimal threshold detection 2 g/L . 4 . Use neurotoxic medication clear association peripheral neuropathy within past 1 year base upon clinical impression association . 5 . Previous exposure chemotherapeutic agent clear association peripheral neuropathy time . History 2 severe hypoglycemic episode within previous 6 month . History cluster hypoglycemia episode within previous 12 month . History active recent ( &lt; 5 year ) malignancy . History systemic local nasal disease would complicate use intranasal insulin . Presence diabetic nephropathy require dialysis . Presence active proliferative retinopathy require surgery within 6 month .
