	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - determine maximally-tolerated dose ( MTD ) and/or maximum-feasible dose ( MFD ) JX-594 administer biweekly intravenous ( IV ) infusion . - determine safety JX-594 ( TK- GM-CSF+ Wyeth strain vaccinia ) administer biweekly IV infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial JX-594 Refractory Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b , open-label , dose-escalation trial patient advance colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) fail oxaliplatin base irinotecan base prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Patients receive treatment one three dose level sequential dose-escalating design . Three patient treat dose level unless dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe . Enrollment proceed next dose level 0 3 patient experience DLT ; one first 3 patient experience DLT , additional patient enrol second patient experience DLT ( defines toxic dose ) six total patient treat dose level , whichever come first . If second DLT experience within cohort , dose escalation may continue . Patients enrol minimum 14 day first treatment immediately precede patient first patient cohort remain patient cohort DLT . If 2 DLTs observe within cohort , enrollment cohort cease dose level immediately precede dose determine MTD . Regulatory Authorities IRB notify require patient dy within 28 day product administration due serious unexpected ADR determine Investigator possibly probably related JX-594 . Once MTD and/or MFD define , additional 3-6 patient may enrol dose level . Note : MTD and/or MFD define , treatment additional patient dose level long require inter-patient delay 14 day .</detailed_description>
