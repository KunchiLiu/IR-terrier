	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate new agent Axitinib treatment head neck cancer . This new drug give pill twice day treat cancer . This one new , `` smart '' drug . It bind protein surface cancer cell call VEGFR , way slow growth cancer cell kill . Head neck cancer cell know carry protein surface . Research animals patient kind cancer show Axitinib effective kill cancer cell , stop growth , mechanism . It generally safe drug give mouth . The investigator know , however , whether Axitinib effective head neck cancer . This research study conduct learn Axitinib work head neck cancer , also learn predict would benefit . Four blood draw do check special blood test subject treat Axitinib . These drawn time routine lab , additional stick need . A biopsy tumor 1 month treatment may obtain test cancer cell respond treatment . By test blood tissue sample , researcher look special test ( protein molecule ) try determine kind head neck patient would best respond drug . This open-label study , mean subject active drug placebo ( sugar pill ) .</brief_summary>
