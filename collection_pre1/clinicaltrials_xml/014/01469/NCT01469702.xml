	<brief_summary>Bartonella henselae etiologic agent cat scratch disease ( CSD ) . 90 % patient present regional lymphadenitis ( typical CSD ) 10 % disease involve organ , neuroretinitis , arthropathy , erythema nodosum , encephalitis ( atypical CSD ) . In CSD case resolution occur 2 3 month although prolonged course often occur . Data efficacy antibiotic therapy CSD limit . Azithromycin show small favorable effect small comparative study commonly prescribe CSD , however overall effect satisfactory . Corticosteroids may effective treatment CSD follow reason : - Many expert believe host response involve pathogenesis CSD responsible clinical manifestation rather direct effect B. henselae . The absence viable organism affect lymph node ( presence positive PCR B. henselae DNA ) , fact arthritis , arthralgia erythema nodosum ( often associate autoimmune disease ) describe CSD , support concept . - Corticosteroids anecdotally report administered patient CSD , apparently success . The purpose study evaluate efficacy corticosteroid addition azithromycin CSD . The study hypothesis corticosteroid improve come . Ten patient typical CSD treat 5-day oral course prednisone ( 1 mg/kg 60 mg/day ) azithromycin ( 500 mg day 1 250 mg day 2-5 ) . Patients follow 3 month . Major outcome measure include duration symptom sign , particular emphasis affect lymph node size duration use specific score system ( lymphadenitis score , LS ) . LS use evaluate lymphadenitis follow-up visit . The time period baseline LS 75 % 90 % reduction LS treatment group compare historical control . The historical control group consist age , sex , clinical manifestations-matched CSD patient treat azithromycin without corticosteroid .</brief_summary>
