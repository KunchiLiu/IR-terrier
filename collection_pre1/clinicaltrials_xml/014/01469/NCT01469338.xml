	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel Plus Prednisone With Octreotide For Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) Previously Treated With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact octreotide reduce incidence grade 2 great diarrhea men receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) docetaxel therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival ( OS ) . II . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) ( defined time treatment start first date progression measure objective tumor progression use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , pain progression death ) . III . Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate . IV . Objective response rate . V. Pain response . VI . Toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenous ( IV ) infusion 1 hour day 1 , prednisone mouth ( PO ) every day ( QD ) , octreotide pamoate give intramuscular ( IM ) injection day 1 . Patients also receive octreotide acetate subcutaneous ( SC ) injection three time day ( TID ) day 1-14 course 1 . Treatment cabazitaxel repeat every 21 day treatment prednisone octreotide pamoate repeat every 4 week 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month disease progression , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
