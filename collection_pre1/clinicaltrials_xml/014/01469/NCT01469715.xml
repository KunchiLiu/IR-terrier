	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess accuracy Becton Dickenson ( BD ) Technologies Glucose Binding Protein-Based Continuous Glucose Monitor ( GBP CGM ) patient Type 1 diabetes low ( goal glucose 55 mg/dL ) , normal ( 80-140 mg/dL ) high ( &gt; 180mg/dL ) glucose level 24 hour period . This achieve monitoring blood sugar level regular dinner meal give , liquid breakfast meal ( BOOST Original contain 41 gram Carbohydrates ( CHO ) , 4 gram fat , 10 gram protein ) give , subcutaneous insulin dose induce hypoglycemia goal 55 mg/dL , regular lunch meal give . A Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) electronic device measure display blood sugar ( glucose ) level body throughout day night . The method use detect blood sugar investigational Glucose Binding Protein-Based Continuous Glucose Monitor ( GBP CGM ) different method currently use commercially available model . Some sensor tell difference glucose ( sugar ) substances Tylenol , aspirin citric acid etc . Because tell difference , may give false reading . The GBP CGM make recognize glucose body rather substance ( e.g. , Tylenol , aspirin , citric acid , etc. ) . As result , investigator expect new GBP CGM accurate detect low blood sugar level current device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Performance Glucose Blinding Protein-Based Continuous Glucose Monitor ( GBP CGM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Development accurate continuous glucose monitoring device critically important maintenance strict glycemic control without increase risk hypoglycemia successful implementation artificial pancreas . Glucose bind protein-based ( GBP ) continuous glucose monitor offer several potential advantage commercially available glucose oxidase base sensor . Unlike glucose oxidase base sensor , GBP sensor require establishment equilibrium reduction/oxidation reaction susceptible interference compound engineer recognize glucose . As result , GBP-based glucose sensor exceptionally accurate low blood glucose level faster warm-up time glucose oxidase base system . The principal idea proposal evaluate accuracy performance second generation glucose bind protein-based continuous glucose monitor ( GBP CGM ) develop BD Technologies subject type 1 diabetes , emphasis warm-up period insertion , accuracy hypoglycemic hyperglycemic range , lag time 24 hour period sensor use . In order accomplish , investigator conduct clinical trial consist 25.5-hour study involve 15 subject , wear one active one mock ( GBP ) device simultaneously meal induce hypoglycemia observe wide range glucose value . The investigator envision glucose bind protein-based continuous glucose monitor demonstrate minimal warm-up time insertion , overall accuracy comparable commercial glucose oxidase sensor excellent performance hypoglycemic range nominal lag time sense change blood glucose .</detailed_description>

Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL confirm 2 . Twohour oral Glucose Tolerance Tests ( OGTT ) glucose ≥200 mg/dL confirm 3 . HbA1c ≥6.5 % document confirmed 4 . Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL symptom 5 . No data diagnosis available participant convince history hyperglycemia consistent diabetes Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( 1 must meet ) : 1 . Participant required insulin diagnosis continually thereafter 2 . Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) require insulin eventually use continually 3 . Participant start insulin diagnosis continue hyperglycemic , positive islet cell antibody consistent latent autoimmune diabetes adult ( LADA ) require insulin eventually use continually Use insulin pump treat diabetes least six month prior study . Actively use bolus calculator function current insulin pump predefined parameter glucose goal ( ) , carbohydrate ratio ( ) , insulin sensitivity factor ( ) .
