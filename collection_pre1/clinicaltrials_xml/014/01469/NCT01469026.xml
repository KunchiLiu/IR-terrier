	<brief_summary>The purpose elucidate value PET/CT apply early work-up patient metastasise cancer unknown primary tumor . The management patient metastasise cancer unknown primary often include various large number radiographic study invasive procedure , occult primary tumor detect less 20 % . Early PET/CT may useful Cancer Unknown Primary ( CUP ) expensive invasive diagnostic procedure carry . The outcome may higher tumor detection rate quicker diagnosis , avoid unnecessary , extensive procedure . Furthermore , large number patient receive treatment aim correct diagnosis . Therefore , prospective cost-effectiveness analysis warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Every year , 800-1000 patient Denmark classify diagnosis metastasise cancer unknown primary ( CUP ) . This correspond approximately 3 % percent new cancer case national scale . The number probably higher , since heterogeneous group patient register consistently . The prognosis poor ; average survival approximately one year . CUP characterize find metastasis start point ( primary tumour ) unknown . Typically , one find enlarge lymph node neck , swell throat stomach , fill skin tumour detect somewhere body X-Ray examination , endoscopy like . In spite search apply multiple technique , primary tumour remain unknown 70-80 % patient . A great number patient experience long discontinuous examination sequence mark various contact doctor , many examination disperse many day location , well lot time waste , exist single option institution take care patient handle diagnostic procedure treatment efficiently . Treatment often initiate late , typically combination several chemotherapeutics order cover different type cancer simultaneously , modern chemotherapeutical regime increase survival rate . The bad prognosis undoubtedly due fact patient diagnose advanced phase . Alternatively , primary tumour detect . This , part , due absence single agency possession competence responsibility implement work-up without delay , maybe one offer examination modality ( PET/CT ) likely detect presence cancer , start point dispersion early stage . Methods : Patients randomize 1:1 diagnostic arm 'conventional diagnostics incl . CT ' 'early PET/CT ' study entry . Before study start , randomization list prepare accord assignment patient treatment arm perform . The early PET/CT examination perform Department Nuclear Medicine Odense University Hospital ( OUH ) use tracer [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) . Patients request appear fast state ( minimum 6 hour ) administer intravenously FDG radioactively label glucose-analog enters cell know glucose transport system . The usage FDG cancer tracer base increase metabolism glucose demand rapidly grow proliferate cell . FDG remain within cell since metabolize . The patient scan base scull mid thigh integrate PET/CT scanner ( GE Healthcare DiscoveryTM STE ) . A standardized CT protocol use ( Smart mA 30-400 mA noise index 18.0 rotation time 0.8 s. , kV 120 , reconstruction thickness 3.75 mm ) , follow PET examination ( record time 2.5 min pr . field view ) . CT scan do intravenous contrast medium ( Ultravist 370 mg I/ml ) . The effective dose 18-20 mSv CT 5-6 mSv FDG PET . Every patient Department Nuclear Medicine height weight measure PET/CT PET/CT examination must start interval 60 Â± 5 min . injection FDG . Serum glucose concentration measure injection FDG must exceed 8 mmol/L ( 150 mg/dL ) The first 40 patient negative FDG-PET/CT extra , late scan ( without new contrast FDG-injection ) . One half ( 20 patient ) scan 3 hour second half ( 20 patient ) scan 4 hour injection FDG . This examine whether late focal uptake patient due slow slightly increase glucose uptake . If , standard time point scan remain patient 3 4 hour injection FDG order optimize chance detect also slow grow tumour metastasis . Identification primary tumor : The primary tumor confirm histopathological examination relevant biopsy specimen . Endpoints : In order evaluate hypothesis , follow data collect patient retrospectively local patient report file system FPAS : 1 . Detection primary tumor possible : yes/no ( primary endpoint ) 2 . Time frame inclusion study detection primary tumor . 3 . Time frame inclusion study referral palliative curative treatment . 4 . Time frame inclusion study end follow-up death . 5 . Total score Quality Life instrument `` SF-36 '' . Population : All patient recruit Emergency Department base subjective selection discretion train internal medicine specialist ( KKP ) . The expected number patient 220 . Ethics : The risk PET/CT consist extra radiation dose ( 5-6mSv , p 4 ) , PET-examination add patient beyond dose CT ( 18-20mSv ) . The dose radiation PET insignificant ( total estimate risk : 1/10.000 ) , estimate risk radiation dose CT 1/1000 . The lifetime risk develop cancer 25 % . Performing PET/CT scan increase lifetime risk 25 % 25,1 % . The radiation dose use never prove cause adverse effect . The increase lifetime effect consider acceptable compare improvement diagnostic yield , patient course target treatment . Patient information describe study provide sufficient information patient make informed decision participation hand patient write form . The patient 24 hour think make final decision whether participate . Participation voluntary consent anytime withdraw without consequence patient 's future treatment . The Informed Consent form sign participate patient store Department Nuclear Medicine</detailed_description>
