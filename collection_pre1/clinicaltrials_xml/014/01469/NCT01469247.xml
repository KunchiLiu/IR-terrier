	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find safe dose radiation give patient brainstem glioma already receive radiation therapy . You receive photon radiation therapy . This type radiation similar radiation already . Conformal radiotherapy intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) use try treat tumor affect little surround normal tissue possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ( DIPG ) Reirradiation ( ReRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation Therapy Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level radiation therapy base join study . Three ( 3 ) dose level radiation therapy test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group randomly assign ( roll dice ) one dose level , assignment also depend previous participant do . Participants assign one high 2 3 dose level unless low dose level find tolerable . The first second group receive 12 treatment third group receive 14 treatment ( Monday Friday 2Â½ week ) . Your doctor tell many treatment receive . You may give drug help prevent side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Study Visits : About 2-4 day start radiation therapy , simulation . During simulation session , mask make face head keep still . You also compute tomography ( CT ) scan . This process allow radiation plan take place . Sedation anesthesiologist ( anesthesia doctor ) use need young child allow radiotherapy deliver safely . One ( 1 ) time week 3 week , 1 time month ( 30 day +/- 10 day ) 2 month unless disease get bad : - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - You fill quality-of-life questionnaire . - You ask side effect may . You magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain within 1 month joining study . Length Treatment : You may continue receive radiation therapy 12 14 treatment . You longer able receive radiation therapy disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-up Visits : One ( 1 ) month finish radiation therapy , 6-8 week , every 2-3 month , MRI scan check status disease . The MRI scan include advanced imaging learn tumor come back brain tissue damage radiation . With type imaging , temporary infusion line big standard size needle insert vein already power port-a-cath place . This may take 20-30 minute . This investigational study . Radiation therapy study deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . It investigational find best dose radiation therapy use repeat radiation therapy . Up 30 participant enrol study .</detailed_description>
