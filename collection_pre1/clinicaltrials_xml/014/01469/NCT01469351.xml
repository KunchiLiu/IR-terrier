	<brief_summary>Today Alzheimers disease cure . Animal experiment show hormone GLP-1 improve memory Alzheimer-prone mouse . The investigator hypothesis 6-month treatment GLP-1 receptor stimulate drug liraglutide reduce intracerebral amyloid deposition central nervous system ( CNS ) patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) thereby reduce clinical symptom disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence type 2 diabetes ( DM-2 ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) increase last year , result increase morbidity mortality . DM-2 risk factor AD vascular dementia . In addition , increase incidence DM-2 Alzheimer 's patient observe . The understanding underlying mechanism behind linkage far sparse . In disease premature cell degeneration develop . DM-2 characterized loss β-cell function β cell mass pancreas , whereas AD show loss neuronal function well neuronal cell death . General metabolic risk factor hyperglycemia hypercholesterolemia evident disease . Glucagon-like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) incretin hormone numerous documented effect glycaemic response . It release response food ingestion consequently exert glucose-dependent stimulation insulin secretion inhibit glucagon secretion . In animal experiment well cell experiment β-cell neogenesis , growth differentiation stimulate GLP-1 , inhibition β-cell apoptosis demonstrate cell study . In addition α- β-cells pancreas , GLP-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) localize CNS , GLP-1R distribute correspond hypothalamus hippocampus . Experimental investigation mice GLP-1 give intra-cerebroventricularly , GLP-1R stimulation reduce nerve cell damage cause neurotoxic stimulus . Furthermore , GLP-1R stimulation hippocampus induce learning ability memory show GLP-1R stimulation leeds neurite outgrowth protects nerve cell apoptosis . In connection hyperinsulinaemia early stage DM-2 , study suggest stimulation insulin receptor represent brain produce increase level β-amyloid increase number neurofibrillary tangle . AD pathologically characterize increased level β-amyloid well increased number neurofibrillar tangle . Accumulation β-amyloid brain localize area cognitive function . A recent animal experimental work show reduced memory GLP-1 receptor KO mouse mention lack possible neuroprotective effect potential explanation observation . In study human worsen cognitive function show associated dementia DM-2 , even though actual causal relation yet find . The investigator recently show GLP-1 neuroprotective function patient DM-2 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan well evaluate clinical demonstration CNS change follow AD include change amyloid deposit . Presently register drug change deposition amyloid drug convince effect progression disease patient Alzheimer 's . Moreover drug market treatment disadvantageous side effect profile . Besides insulin , β-cells secrete amylin , amyloid IAPP ( islet amyloid polypeptide ) thus share certain characteristic β-amyloid . Previously IAPP consider non-toxic recent study indicate possible conversion toxic β-amyloid . The insulin-producing β-cells find characterized accumulation amyloid several DM-2 model . A recent study treatment DPP-4 inhibitor ( increase endogenous GLP-1 ) improve glucose tolerance , increase GLP-1 level normalize topography islet Langerhans mouse model β cell specific expression human amyloid . The investigator hypothesis 26 week treatment GLP-1 receptor stimulate pharmaceutical liraglutide reduce intracerebral amyloid deposition CNS patient Alzheimer 's disease , demonstrate PET . The investigator aim clinical study able give new information effect GLP-1 axis CNS explore potential treatment large group patient offer effective drug today . Altogether result study contribute development future treatment option AD .</detailed_description>
