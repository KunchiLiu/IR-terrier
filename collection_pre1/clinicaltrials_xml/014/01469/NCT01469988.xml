	<brief_title>The VO2 Increase With Testosterone Addition - Heart Failure ( VITA-HF ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure prevalent condition major public health importance lead significant morbidity mortality despite use current evidence-based therapy . Further development novel therapy alleviate symptom , improve functional status ultimately clinical outcome need . Cardiac function alone explain aspect heart failure syndrome : hence search peripheral mechanism inter-connected cardiac non-cardiac pathway ensue . Testosterone play integral role multiple organ system growth , development maintenance health know effect peripheral musculature , vasculature , sympathetic tone , endothelial function restoration muscle metabolic function would beneficial HF . Chronic HF associate reduce testosterone level , low testosterone level link reduced VO2 , increase BNP ANP level , bad clinical outcome . Testosterone supplementation act peripheral vasodilator acutely increase cardiac output , would improve oxygen delivery skeletal muscle secondarily delay transfer anaerobic metabolism depletion high-energy phosphate . The increase muscle mass associate testosterone therapy may also result increase endurance decrease muscle fatigability HF patient . Early small trial demonstrate safety , tolerability improvement exercise walk distance patient HF . We contend time ripe adequately-powered phase II trial order test therapy improve symptom functional status patient heart failure . Specific Aim : Evaluate efficacy safety testosterone supplementation functional capacity , biomarkers , quality life clinical outcome patient heart failure . Synopsis : We propose phase II randomize control , multi-center , double-blind trial , `` The VO2Increase Testosterone Addition - Heart Failure ( VITA-HF ) Trial '' . We plan enroll 318 patient chronic HF NYHA II-III 1:1 trial testosterone therapy ( versus placebo ) : primary objective test effect peak VO2 26 week ( commonly use surrogate outcome phase II HFRCTthat represent central peripheral effect intervention ) . Given assumption make ( peak VO2 standard deviation 2.7 mls/kg/min , pair t-test , 2-sided alpha 0.05 ) , 318 patient 85 % power detect 1.0 ml/kg/min difference group change peak VO2 26 week . The minimally clinically important difference peak VO2 may small 0.26 mls/kg/min possibly higher therefore , take conservative approach similar CIHR NIH trial . Additional measure quality life , biomarkers ( BNP ) clinical outcome perform 26 52 week . Quantitative measurement core laboratory echocardiographic imaging also assess effect leave ventricular remodel marker systolic diastolic function . Assessment 26 week allow early effect demonstrate whereas secondary endpoint evaluate 52 week demonstrate clinical outcome important phase III planning ( include clinical , biochemical echocardiographic endpoint ) .Androgel 5g select due compliance prior RCT dosing ensure efficacy broad safety margin . Feasibility : The investigator grant attend physician large , tertiary care heart failure clinic large patient population extensive experience recruiting patient clinical study . The 7 site select experience expertise enrol HF patient CIHR NIH trial . Importance : Our propose trial ( VITA-HF ) test novel strategic target could enhance quality potentially quantity life patient heart failure modulate complementary peripheral central HF mechanism .</detailed_description>
