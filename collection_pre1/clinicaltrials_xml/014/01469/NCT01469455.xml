	<brief_summary>Phase I trial conduct patient suffer local metastatic melanoma relapse cutaneous/subcutaneous tumor include melanoma-in-transit . Based preclinical data package , DNA Therapeutics consider risk-benefit ratio DT01 support initiation phase I clinical study population . The recommended starting dose DT01 first injection human base NOAELs Maximum Recommended Starting Dose ( MRSD ) calculation consider local systemic approach . It set 16 mg ( 4 mg per injection site , 2 injection per tumor , 2 tumor treat ) . This start dose increase 96 mg DLT occur dose escalation . DT01 locally administer peritumoral subcutaneous and/or intratumoral injection combination hypo-fractionated radiotherapy ( RT ) ( 10x 3 Gy ) chloroquine ( 100 mg oral QD ) start one week DT01 RT treatment . DT01 administer 3 time week two week ; The study open , non-randomised , multicentre , phase I dose escalation ( 16 , 32 , 48 , 64 96 mg ) safety study 3+3 design . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerance , pharmacokinetics DT01 association palliative radiotherapy evaluate pharmacodynamics anti-tumor activity DT01 accord RECIST criterion day 26 , 40 54 . The duration response ( Time-To-Local Recurrence , TTLR ) , monitor 3 , 6 , 9 12 month begin DT01 treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According WHO , incidence melanoma 199,627 worldwide 2008 , melanoma-in-transit 4 % . When melanoma spread , lymphatic system drain regional lymph node . Uncommonly , melanoma become trapped lymphatic vessel grow cause tumor nodule skin subcutaneous tissue primary site regional lymph node basin . These nodule term in-transit metastasis carry ominous prognosis . The American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) define in-transit metastasis skin subcutaneous metastasis 2 cm primary lesion beyond regional nodal basin . The 2010 tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) stag system considers melanoma-in-transit N2c stage arise absence nodal metastasis . The current treatment option ( approve late stage development ) : - Local excision , ; - Isolated limb perfusion ( local high dose chemotherapy ) ; - Systemic chemotherapy ( Dacarbazine , Temozolomide , Cis-platine ) ; - Targeted therapy ( B-raf inhibitor : Vemurafenib Dabrafenib ; MEK inhibitor : Trametinib ) ; - Immunotherapy ( Ipilimumab , Nivolumab , Pembrolizumab , OncoVEX GM-CSF , Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] ) ; - Radiotherapy ; - Photodynamic therapy ; - Laser vaporization . With rare exception , none treatment curative . Immunotherapy result prolongation survival although overall response rate remain low ( ref : oncovex phase II study ) . According Sponsor 's clinical development strategy plan , local metastatic melanoma relapse cutaneous/subcutaneous tumor , include melanoma-in-transit , choose 1st indication evaluate safety , tolerance PK DT01 combination palliative radiotherapy ( 10x3 Gy ) . The presence multiple cutaneous/subcutaneous tumor provide initial clinical evaluation safety skin tolerance combine treatment DT01 10x3 Gy irradiation , well preliminary assessment anti-tumor activity ( proof concept ) DT01 sensitize improve response rate radiotherapy ( estimate 50 % response rate ) , delay local relapse . Based pharmacologically active dose human melanoma xenografted tumor mouse wide safety margin estimate toxicology data , start dose 16 mg plan dose escalation represent conservative approach titration . The dose escalation provide valuable information safety , tolerance preliminary efficacy data .</detailed_description>
