	<brief_summary>Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) major cause nondental pain orofacial area . Laser therapy consider one popular method pain relief TMD patient . The special feature laser light coherence , monochromaticity , collimation result ability laser light modify cellular metabolism , increase tissue repair reduce edema inflammation . The effectiveness low level laser therapy reduce sign symptom temporomandibular joint disorder investigated study . But , previous study etiology TMD consider patient selection . Furthermore , controversy result study . According data , study evaluate effect low level laser therapy patient TMJ osteoarthritis . The aim study evaluate effectiveness low level laser therapy improve osteoarthritis temporomandibular joint also evaluate long term effect laser therapy morphology joint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Low Level Laser Therapy Improvement Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project method : This study implement 20 patient age 35-60 year refer Department Prosthetic Dentistry Mashhad Dental School . The patient select accord RDC/TMD criterion include temporomandibular osteoarthritis unknown etiology . The patient ask take cone beam CT temporomandibular joint evaluate change morphology TMJ . The patient randomly assign two group : Group 1 ( treatment group ) receive low level laser therapy . The laser light applied 890 nm diode laser ( Mustang 2000+ , Russia ) frequency 1500 Hz , dose 2 J/cm2 per point joint area painful muscle . In Group 2 ( placebo ) low power laser apply minimal dose lower threshold necessary therapeutic effect . Laser therapy treatment placebo group apply back , front , mandibular condyle inside external auditory meatus also painful muscle three time week four week . Patients evaluated start treatment , 6th 12th session laser therapy also one month end treatment . At evaluation , pain level opening mouth masticatory muscle tenderness measure accord Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The range lateral protrusive mandibular movement , difficulty chew food presence absence sound joint also evaluate . One year treatment , patient refer take second cone beam CT TMJ seek change morphology joint .</detailed_description>
