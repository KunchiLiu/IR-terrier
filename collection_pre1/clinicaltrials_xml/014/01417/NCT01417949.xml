	<brief_title>Immediate Versus Deferred Antiretroviral Therapy HIV-infected Patients Presenting With Acute AIDS-defining Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To compare early versus defer initiation antiretroviral combination therapy consist tenofovir , emtricitabine atazanavir/ritonavir treatment naive patient present acute AIDS-defining illness , namely pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) toxoplasma gondii encephalitis ( TE ) . The primary objective study follow : To compare rate clinical progression group . Progression define death , new/relapsing opportunistic infection ( OI ) , grade 4 clinical endpoint ( evaluate standardize toxicity table ) within 24 week randomization . The secondary objective study : - evaluate compare hospitalization day completion initial OI treatment group . - evaluate incidence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS , definition see Objectives ) group first 24 week . - evaluate compare virological outcome proportion group . Virological outcome assess HIV-1 plasma viral load Week 24 ( proportion patient achieve HIV RNA 50 copies/mL ) . For definition virological failure , see . - evaluate compare frequency change ART regimen lack efficacy toxicity group . - evaluate quality life ( QOL ) adherence ARV regimen subject start tenofovir , emtricitabine atazanavir/ritonavir late stage HIV-1-infection . Study Design : Prospective , randomize , open-label multicenter study Number Subjects Randomized : 105 patient per arm ( total 210 patient plan ) . Target Population : ART naïve HIV-1 infect adult , develop acute AIDS defining opportunistic infection , namely PCP TE . Duration Treatment : 24 week Diagnosis Main Eligibility Criteria : Key Inclusion Criteria : - Adult ( least 18 year ) HIV-1 infected subject - Antiretroviral naïve HIV-1-infected patient develop acute AIDS defining event , namely PCP TE ( woman receive prior MTCT prophylaxis may enrol ) - Patients able take receive antiretroviral treatment able give write consent Key exclusion criterion - Renal failure CrCl 60 mL/min - Patients able initiate ART current contraindication atazanavir/ritonavir - Other AIDS-defining event PCP TE ( exception see ) - Pregnancy/Women childbearing potential want become pregnant Study Procedures/ Frequency : OI Diagnosis , Screening , Randomization - Patients screen immediately diagnosis decision OI treatment make , provide patient 's personal doctor considers ART possible patient agree include study ( write consent ) . - Diagnosis PCP TE establish accord standard care treat physician . A definitive diagnosis ( histologically proven ) require study entry . The decision specific treatment OI also make treat physician accord appropriate guideline . - Screening assessment include medical history , social background , physical examination , height , weight , vital sign , concomitant medication . - Blood parameter assess local lab contain CBC ( complete blood count ) differential platelet count , Bilirubine , ALT , AST , LDH , yGT , serum creatinine , electrolytes ( sodium , potassium , chloride ) , calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) , urinalysis , serum pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) . These result must available send evaluation form . - Further screening assessment include HIV-1 RNA , genotype HIV resistance test , CD4/CD8 T-cell count , serology hepatitis C antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , cryptococcus antigen , CRP T Cell Interferon-Gamma Release Assay ( TIGRA ) . Of note , need wait result screen parameter . - A questionnaire describe social educational status reason present late HIV-infection perform screening entry . A QoL questionnaire ( SF 36 ) also require screening entry . Randomization , Baseline Prior first randomization , every participate center receive study drug treatment three patient one month . Within 24 hour send screen form , site investigator receive randomization sheet decision start ART ( `` immediate '' `` defer '' ) . The day receive randomization sheet define baseline visit . Immediate arm : ART initiate soon possible later 3 day initiation OI treatment . Deferred arm : ART initiate completion OI treatment achieve early day 21 PCP day 28 TE . ART initiate later 6 week initiation OI treatment . Follow Procedures - Week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 Early Study Drug Discontinuation Visit assessment include symptom-directed physical examination , weight , vital sign , concomitant medication , adverse event , HIV-1 RNA , CD4 count , CBC differential platelet count , ALT , AST , LDH , Bilirubine , gGT , serum creatinine , electrolytes , calculate CrCl . - Additional Week 12 , 24 , Early Study Drug Discontinuation Visit assessment include preservation plasma sample HIV genotype/phenotype analysis select center . Subjects HBsAg positive screening HBV DNA HBV serology measure visit . - If subject discontinues study drug prior Week 24 , subject ask return clinic within 72 hour stop study drug Early Study Drug Discontinuation visit . All Week 24 assessment perform visit . - HIV resistance assessment perform patient achieve plasma HIV 1 RNA level &lt; 400 copies/mL Week 24 , achieve plasma HIV 1 RNA level &lt; 400 copies/mL least one occasion , later least two consecutive plasma HIV 1 RNA level &gt; 400 copies/mL , subject discontinue study drug prior Week 24 &gt; 400 copies/mL HIV 1 RNA last study visit prior discontinue study drug . - Additional Week 12 , 24 assessment include patient adherence questionnaire QoL Questionnaire ( SF 36 ) . Test Product , Dose , Mode Administration : Atazanavir capsule 300 mg ritonavir tablets 100 mg , take QD meal . The NRTI backbone chosen treat physician preferably combination emtricitabine tenofovir DF tablet . Criteria Evaluation : Primary Endpoint : Clinical Progression ( death , new relapse OI , Grade 4 clinical endpoint ) within 24 week . For G4 event standardized toxicity grading table use . For abnormality find Toxicity Tables , Grade 4 event define potentially life-threatening ( extreme limitation activity , significant assistance require ; significant medical intervention/therapy require , hospitalization hospice care probable ) . Patients drop study observation end week 12 count clinical progression . Secondary Endpoints - Hospitalization day completion OI treatment - Incidence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) judge site investigator ( definition see ) compare two group first 24 week . - Virological outcome week 24 ( proportion patient achieve HIV RNA &lt; 400 ( &lt; 50 copies/mL ) . - Proportion patient change ARV regimen lack efficacy toxicity - evaluate compare immunological outcome proportion group . - Quality life ( QOL ) , include overall self-reported QOL Week 24 Statistical Methods : Tabular and/or graphical descriptive method use summarize explore result . Continuous variable summarize mean , standard deviation , minimum , 25th , 50th ( median ) , 75th percentile maximum . Count percent subject summarize categorical variable . Appropriate transformation apply ( e.g. , log10 HIV-1 RNA ) . Appropriate confidence interval ( two-sided ; 95 % ) calculate change major endpoint . Appropriate test significance may also perform . This study conduct accordance guideline Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) include archive essential document .</detailed_description>
