	<detailed_description>New technology develop enhance visualization colorectal mucosa unmask even minute mucosal lesion identify neoplastic lesion non-neoplastic lesion . In particular , appear strong evidence pan-colonic chromoendoscopy enhances detection colorectal neoplasm colon rectum . However , technique time-consuming dye spray suction collect dye dependent portion , therefore unsuitable routine application . To overcome inconvenience , optical-digital method involve conversion optical characteristic light use illumination image light source differ optical characteristic ordinary white light ( WL ) , narrow band imaging ( NBI ) , Fujinon image color enhancement ( FICE ) , auto-fluorescence imaging ( AFI ) infra-red imaging ( IRI ) . I-scan technology newly develop image enhance endoscopy technology , classify digital contrast method among endoscopic image techniques.19 I-scan three mode image enhancement , i.e . surface enhancement ( SE ) ; contrast enhancement ( CE ) ; tone enhancement ( TE ) . The three mode ( SE , CE TE ) arrange series , therefore , possible apply two three mode one time . Switching level mode enhancement do real-time basis , without time lag push relevant button , thus enable efficient endoscopic observation . Furthermore , NBI ) image much darker conventional white light ( WL ) image , i-scan image bright conventional WL image , therefore , i-scan able observe much large area distant view compare NBI . Consequently , i-scan might useful perform screen endoscopy ) . However , actual usefulness I-scan enhance detection colonic neoplastic lesion know yet screen colonoscopy . Therefore , tried evaluate hypothesis , subject undergoing colonoscopy screening , routine application i-scan withdrawal could improve adenoma detection compare standard WL examination .</detailed_description>
