	<brief_title>Effect Glycine Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disorder cause mutation gene codifies chloride channel name `` cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator '' ( CFTR ) . In lungs result thick dehydrated mucus tend cause obstruction bronchial lumen . Neutrophils proinflammatory substance detect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid child CF bacterial infection . This inflammation condition vicious circle airway colonize bacteria increase inflammation . Persistent inflammation lead irreversible change airway , become distorted . Therefore , key step CF treatment reduction airway inflammation , long-term use corticosteroid , ibuprofen macrolides may indicate . Glycine antiinflammatory effect . Glycine simple aminoacid , also agonist glycine receptor ( GlyR ) , activate , cause cell Kupffer cell , alveolar macrophage neutrophil decrease sensitivity proinflammatory agent . Orally administered glycine use illness , notice well tolerate . Considering child CF intense inflammatory process airway , propose use glycine antiinflammatory agent . Problem statement . Can glycine oral supplement decrease airway inflammation child CF ? Hypothesis . Compared placebo , daily supplement glycine administer 8 week child CF produce statistically significant decrease bronchial inflammation , measure concentration neutrophil inflammatory substance sputum peripheral blood , well respiratory symptom spirometry . Main objective : To determine whether daily supplement 0.5 g/kg glycine 8 week significantly decrease concentration , include neutrophil , interleukin ( IL ) -1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , myeloperoxidase , sputum peripheral blood child CF . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine glycine improve respiratory symptom , include decreased amount well fluidity sputum . 2 . To determine glycine improve spirometric variable . Study design . This randomized , placebo control , blind , two-arms , cross-over clinical trial . Patients receive glycine placebo initial 8 week ( initial phase ) , 2 week washout period , receive alternate treatment another 8 week ( second phase ) . Material method : Children CF fulfil selection criterion study parent accept participation . They randomly assign one two group . The experimental group receive glycine control group receive placebo ( sugar glass ) , dose 0.5 g/kg divide 3 dos per o dissolve liquid . At study entry week 4 , 8 , 10 , 14 18 collect 2 ml blood sample sputum sample , child submit spirometry . A daily symptom questionnaire fill parent . Statistical analysis : Each variable compare experimental control group use Student 's test ( Mann Whitney U test lack normal distribution ) . Sample size : There previous study allow u calculate sample size . For convenience , estimate 30 child include . Time complete : 24 month .</detailed_description>
