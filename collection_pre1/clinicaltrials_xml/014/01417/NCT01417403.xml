	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Undergoing Radiation Therapy Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) hydroxychloroquine safely administer cancer patient association radiation prior develop approach disease treatment . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Beginning 3 day initiation radiotherapy , patient receive hydroxychloroquine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment continue completion radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
