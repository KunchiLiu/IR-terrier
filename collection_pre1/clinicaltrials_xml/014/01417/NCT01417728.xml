	<brief_summary>The aim study analyze mechanism action infliximab endomicroscopic level analyze mucosal heal - i.e . structural functional change mucosa IBD patient - associate process permeability bacterial invasion mucosa . In study role mention parameter establishment endomicroscopic score serve define new prognostic marker view long term remission upon infliximab treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal treatment Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis always induction maintenance symptomatic improvement best remission . There recent evidence immunosuppression treatment infliximab long-term healing bowel achieve affect clinical outcome Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBDs ) include Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis characterise presence extensive area ulceration inflammation gut . These ulceration origin several complication e.g fistula , toxic megacolon , perforation bleed develop neoplasias . Therefore effective treatment IBD imply thoroughly , possible , complete heal bowel ulceration parallel clinical remission . There evidence infliximab , immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody tumour necrosis factor , rapidly improve symptom patient refractory IBDs , also induce mucosal heal ileocolonic lesion week 4 intravenous administration . The key question course whether heal mucosa bowel improve also microstructural level mucosa submucosa perhaps translocation commensal bacteria barrier function well . The validity heal maintain microscopic heal bowel mucosa submucosa still show . Clinical study show infliximab heals mucosa colon 60 % 8 week maintain heal al long period time . Unfortunately treatments heal mucosa cure Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ; however , associate prolongation symptom free interval comparison non-healed bowel . This fact suggest disease mechanism mucosa disappear macroscopic heal ulcer intraluminal trigger end damaging mucosa . For purpose clinical trial mucosal heal define far macroscopic view mucosa white light endoscopy . A microscopic analysis microstructure assessment heal seem necessary , especially define objective end point infliximab therapy prevent relapse complication . It known mucosal heal always correlate clinical remission , therefore microscopic diagnosis ongoing inflammation necessary . Recently , miniaturize confocal microscope develop could integrate distal tip conventional colonoscope . This new diagnostic technology gastrointestinal endoscopy , denote confocal endomicroscopy , allow vivo histology mucosal layer ongoing colonoscopy . Furthermore , patient screen sporadic colorectal cancer , surface subsurface analysis cellular subcellular resolution could use predict intraepithelial neoplasia ( INs ) high accuracy . Endomicroscopic image acquisition perform place tip colonoscope direct contact target tissue site provide manner surface subsurface image time ongoing video colonoscopy . It allow detailed analysis colorectal crypt architecture , deep vascular net structure detail mucosal / submucosal analysis . Studies patient ulcerative colitis show novel endoscopic approach allow diagnose flat intraepithelial neoplasia high degree accuracy thus emerge crucial innovative image technology colon . Here , propose analyze mucosa patient CrohnÂ´s disease ulcerative colitis infliximab therapy use endomicroscopy analyse microscopic healing process ongoing endoscopy .</detailed_description>
