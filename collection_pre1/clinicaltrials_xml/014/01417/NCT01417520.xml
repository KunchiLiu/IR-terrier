	<brief_summary>Background : - Erdheim Chester Disease ( ECD ) rare disease abnormal white blood cell start grow affect bone , kidney , skin , brain . ECD cause severe lung disease , kidney failure , heart disease , complication lead death . Because ECD rare disease , find mostly men 40 year age , standard treatment . More information need find gene cause ECD best treat . Objectives : - To collect study sample medical information people Erdheim Chester Disease . Eligibility : - Individuals 2 80 year age diagnose Erdheim Chester Disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants study visit provide sample study , include blood , urine , skin tissue sample . Participants also lung , heart , muscle function test ; image study brain , chest , whole body ; treadmill run stress test ; eye exam ; test need study doctor . - Participants ask return similar set test every 2 year , remain contact possible treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Erdheim-Chester Diseases ( ECD ) rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis unknown origin pathogenesis . It report mainly adult male age 40 year , although case report female well . Children rarely affect condition . Mutation BRAF gene recently identify 50 % Erdheim Chester lesion French cohort18 ; family study perform due rarity sporadic nature disease . The clinical characteristic ECD range asymptomatic multisystemic involvement ; longitudinal progression natural history well document . ECD commonly affect bone , kidney , retroperitoneal space , skin brain . After diagnosis , disease progress rapidly , cause fatal outcome due severe lung disease , chronic renal failure , cardiomyopathy complication . The diagnosis ECD rely upon image study specific pathologic finding biopsy affect organ , i.e. , fibrosis infiltration affect tissue foamy histiocyte , lymphocyte , plasma cell . Immunohistochemistry reveals cell positive CD68 , CD 163 negative CD1a S-100 ; although 20 % positivity report S-100 marker . There standard treatment ECD , although chemotherapy cladribine , radiation , stem cell transplantation , alpha-interferon , anakinra , imatinib , steroid sirolimus propose . Symptomatic improvement report therapy , death within year diagnosis remain expect outcome . For patient BRAF V600E mutation detect , use BRAF Inhibitors vemurafenib currently study . We currently study use Dabrafnib Trametinib patient BRAF V600E mutation . In protocol , clinically evaluate ECD patient , obtain cell , plasma , urine , search gene responsible ECD , perform study dictate patient presentation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ECD patient gender ethnicity age 280 year eligible enroll protocol . Patients diagnose ECD base upon pathologic evaluation affect organ . Any child old 2 year confirm ECD pathology enrol study since childhood case rare . The child must clinically stable prior visit NIHCC . Patients agree part research study expect undergo evaluation test protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude suspected diagnosis ECD confirm biopsy another form histiocytosis . If patient travel NIH medical condition , still participate study submit tissue blood research purpose consent obtain diagnosis ECD confirm tissuebiopsy evaluation . This exception apply patient age 280 year . Children age two year exclude urgency early diagnosis care readily provide old child Clinical Center . Pregnant woman able part study risk harmful fetus , unless participate submit sample already available affected tissue pregnant . By mean encourage pregnant woman undergo affect organ surgery biopsy order participate study unless clinically indicate recommend primary care provider .</criteria>
