	<detailed_description>Background Over 3000 people year undergo bypass operation low limb , operation carry significant risk approximately 1 20 people die hospital , another 1 20 heart attack . The number people type procedure grow recent year trend predict continue . Due significant increase volume patient , associate complication occur surgery , utilisation resource critical care often need . Assessment patient order stratify risk die significant complication aid improve care , allow good utilisation scarce critical care resource , also allow u provide patient good information part inform consent process . A high risk group major abdominal surgery identify simple exercise test ( cardiopulmonary exercise test ) look body us oxygen , also blood test look hormone secrete heart . Vascular surgical patient risk development major cardiac complication postoperative period system appropriate preoperative risk stratification yet achieve . Aims The aim project assess feasibility exercise test group patient cycle arm exercise , identify marker outcome group . Identification marker predict patient fare surgery allow u improve informed consent process , utilise resource effectively efficiently identify opportunity attempt modify outcome . Methodology This prospective observational study design test hypothesis combination cardiopulmonary exercise test blood test provide prognostic value outcome measure surgery low limb revascularisation . Participants 2 exercise test , one arm one cycle , prior surgery preoperative assessment appointment . From test measure much work patient , much oxygen able use , heart unable deliver enough oxygen cell . In addition blood sample take prior operation ( brain natriuretic peptide ) , day 1 3 ( troponin I ) operation look cardiac marker damage . This data use see predict patient short long term complication , also see whether different form exercise test comparable , one type superior . Expected outcome We expect combination exercise test blood test able identify patient increase risk complication surgery . We also expect find arm exercise feasible informative test cycle exercise . Implications Identification high risk group would allow appropriate strategy implement reduce risk , allow good post-operative resource utilisation . This study also allow large multicentre study adequately power construct .</detailed_description>
