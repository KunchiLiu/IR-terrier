	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Canadians ( Canadian Cancer Society ( CCS ) , 2010 ) . Cigarette smoke responsible 85 % case ( CCS , 2007 ) . Exercise show effective adjunct pharmacological cessation strategy ( Ussher , Taylor , &amp; Faulkner , 2008 ) . A recent systematic review conclude single bout low moderate intensity exercise help regulate craving , withdrawal symptom negative affect associate quitting ( Taylor , Ussher , &amp; Faulkner , 2007 ) . Smoking satisfaction immediately reinforce effect nicotine . Smoking satisfaction may outweigh temporally distant adverse health risk smoke ( Cappelleri , Bushmakin , Baker , Merikle , Olufade , &amp; Gilbert , 2007 ) . Varenicline , alpha 4-beta-2 nAChR partial agonist , mimic effect nicotine reduce craving withdrawal symptom ( Coe et al. , 2005 ) . A 12-week treatment period varenicline show reduce smoke satisfaction ( Jorenby et al. , 2006 ) . However , effect acute exercise smoking satisfaction yet know . Smoking topography key facet smoke behaviour . Smoking behaviour subjectively objectively measure quantify puff volume , maximum puff velocity , inter-puff interval , puff duration , number puff per cigarette time smoke single cigarette . Smoking topography estimate exposure carcinogenic toxin present cigarette smoking ( Djordjevic , Hoffman , &amp; Hoffman , 1997 ) . Evidence exist support exercise modifies smoke topography ( Katomeri &amp; Taylor 2006 ; Mikhail , 1983 ; Reeser , 1983 ; Zacny &amp; Stitzer , 1985 ) .</detailed_description>
