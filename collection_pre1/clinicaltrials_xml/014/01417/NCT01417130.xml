	<detailed_description>ADAPT multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled trial design test safety efficacy naproxen celecoxib primary prevention Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) dementia attenuation age relate cognitive decline person 70 year age . The ADAPT treatment stop 17 December , 2004 , substantial majority participant give treatment interval one three year . Participants remain observation May , 2006 , use double-masked method case identification identical original ADAPT protocol . Results entire period observation ADAPT ambiguous suggest need additional longitudinal data learn whether dual-inhibitor NSAID naproxen effect long-term reduction occurrence AD dementia . This ADAPT Follow-up Study ( ADAPT-FS ) following-up participant originally enrol ADAPT interval four year , thereby identify additional individual AD dementia treatment assignment group , use time-dependent method estimate contrast incidence rate treatment assignment . The study also extend prior observation trajectory cognitive performance several psychometric measure , thus test hypothesis difference trajectory treatment assignment ADAPT . ADAPT-FS sponsor National Institute Aging ( NIA ) conduct Roskamp Institute Tampa , FL ; Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System Seattle , WA ; Boston University School Medicine , Boston , MA ; Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions , Baltimore , MD ; Sun Health Research Institute , Phoenix , AZ ; University Rochester , Rochester , NY .</detailed_description>
