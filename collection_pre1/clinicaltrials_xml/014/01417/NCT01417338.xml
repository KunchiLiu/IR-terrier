	<detailed_description>Data describe natural history idiopathic familial pulmonary arterial hypertension derive registry conduct institution prior 2006 . Since , target therapy pulmonary arterial hypertension introduce China . It probably prognosis Chinese patient WHO group I pulmonary arterial hypertension WHO group IV pulmonary hypertension due chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension also improve western country . Therefore , aim present study describe real-world outcome Chinese patient pulmonary arterial hypertension chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension identify factor may predict outcome . Our study provide updated picture clinical course broadly define scope pulmonary hypertension effect current therapy survival , enable collection data demographic , clinical course , treatment , outcome .</detailed_description>
