	<brief_summary>This study investigate prevention early mortality patient initiate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) sub-Saharan Africa 79 % co-infected case TB reside . Many publish study show surprisingly high proportion patient initiated ART die within 6 month ( 8-26 % ) increase risk decrease CD4 T cell count . The majority ( median 70 % ) occur first 3 month great proportion death due previously undiagnosed tuberculosis ( TB ) . The investigator enroll patient 4 geographically diverse country ( Gabon , Mozambique , South Africa , Uganda ) randomize open label clinical trial target population people high mortality risk ; patient CD4 T cell count &lt; 50 cells/μl body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 18 kg/m2 . Severely immunocompromised patient low BMI intervention arm receive presumptive anti-TB 4-drug chemotherapy subsequently initiate ART within 2 week compare ART alone . The main objective measure compare early mortality group presumptively treat TB addition ART . Other sub-objectives determine predictor early mortality cause death autopsy ( traditional verbal ) , determine presumptive anti-TB treatment affect viral suppression ART , assess incidence rate characterize drug toxicity patient dually treat . Because high rate TB co-infection sub-Saharan Africa HIV-infected , investigator expect patient presumptively treat TB addition HIV low mortality rate patient receive ART . This trial expect great public health benefit generalisability .</brief_summary>
