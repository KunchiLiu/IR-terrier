	<detailed_description>Congenital developmental cataract priority Vision 2020 : Right Sight , global initiative reduce world 's burden avoidable blindness , important treatable cause visual handicap childhood throughout world . Successful management childhood cataract dependent early diagnosis referral surgery indicate . Accurate optical rehabilitation postoperative supervision also essential . The timing surgery childhood cataract depend etiology degree visual interference . Severe bilateral cataract significant obstruction visual axis must treat surgery recommend soon possible discovery . Ideally cataracts remove 3 month age . In unilateral congenital cataract case prognosis useful vision follow surgery depend prompt restoration clear visual axis , correction aphakia , aggressive treatment amblyopia . In China , severe visual impairment common pediatric patient cataract , delay presentation hospital late surgical treatment find major reason . Therefore , order control childhood blindness severe visual impairment China , essential ensure pediatric patient cataract could good timing surgery , postoperative rigorous supervision , accurate optical rehabilitation aggressive treatment amblyopia . The importance follow-up widely accept applied research many clinical discipline . It doubt rigorous regular follow-up essential successful management childhood cataract , cataract degree visual development individually different change , long-term visual acuity might influence many factor . In word , individual strategy accord result follow-up best choice management childhood cataract . The key make appropriate individual strategy cataract child strict follow-up basis good communication . However , communicate child family complex , routinely involve physician-parent-child triad family member , influenced developmental cognitive stage child , interaction dynamic within family , differ parent child need . In addition communication difficulty , financial difficulty transportation difficulty also common cause pediatric patient ' parent refusal abandonment treatment plan China . As develop country , China 's health-care level currently unsatisfactory health-care reform still need long way go . However , rapid economic development , Chinese cell phone user exceed 900 million people amount make China country large number mobile phone user world , mainly huge population economic development , without factor relate healthcare . Actually , mobile phone communication suggest method improve delivery health service around world , research health care via mobile phone focus HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria . As average-medical-resource-limited country large mobile phone market , China use potential mobile technology health system compare country . It one goals health-care reform wide range medical service could improve provide patient-focused support management health-care system . If mobile phone use improve health outcome resource-limited setting , especially chronic , congenital developmental disease need good communication collaboration , childhood cataract , mobile health technology could thus include health-system strategy help improve health development goal . In trial , aim ass whether mobile phone communication pediatric ophthalmologists parent cataract child involve Childhood Cataract Program Ministry Health China improve follow-up adherence detection rate timing surgery , postoperative complication necessary replacement glass .</detailed_description>
