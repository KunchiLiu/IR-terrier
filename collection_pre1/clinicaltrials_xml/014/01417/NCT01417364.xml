	<brief_summary>The general hypothesis administration testosterone healthy , old men 52 week ( 1 year ) follow cycle 4 week testosterone administration 4 week without testosterone ( i.e. , monthly cycle regimen ) provide gain muscle strength , muscle mass , bone density standard care ( SOC ) , continuous administration testosterone 52 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Long Term Cyclic Testosterone Administration Muscle Function Bone Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis base data current NIA-funded R01 protocol . The investigator treat old men weekly intramuscular injection testosterone enanthate ( 100 mg ) 4 week follow 4 week placebo injection . This 4-week-on , 4-week-off cycle treatment regimen repeat 5 cycle ( 20 week ) . This group compare group old men receive SOC weekly intramuscular injection testosterone enanthate ( 100 mg ) 20 week , another group receive placebo injection . Our preliminary data show equal gain placebo muscle strength lean body mass receive testosterone 20 week , whether SOC continuous cycle . Moreover , group show great bone density marker bone formation placebo . In term anabolic action testosterone skeletal muscle old men , investigator find continuous cycled administration testosterone primarily stimulate muscle protein synthesis 20 week study . Cycled testosterone administration enhance muscle protein synthesis throughout full 5 cycle 20 week , significant loss muscle protein synthesis off-cycle week . Additionally , cycle continuous testosterone administration reduce serum marker bone resorption compare placebo . These exciting finding benefit cycle testosterone regimen old men represent novel therapeutic paradigm exist SOC approach continuous administration . The investigator believe cycle regimen offer safe efficacious approach combat sarcopenia osteoporosis equal anabolic benefit muscle bone half dose testosterone . Critical application significant paradigm shift testosterone administration determine whether effect 20 week persist 52 week propose study , represent treatment duration applicable traditional SOC approach . Thus , central hypothesis cycle administration testosterone 52 week healthy , old men increase muscle function determine muscle strength measurement ( Biodex dynamometer ) , lean body mass ( DEXA ) muscle volume ( MRI ) , bone density ( DEXA ) similar SOC continuous testosterone administration . Moreover , investigator anticipate reduce side effect testosterone administration cycle group since receive one half dose 52 week . The investigator test follow specific hypothesis healthy old adult 52 week cycle , continuous , placebo testosterone : 1 . Cycled continuous testosterone increase muscle strength upper low extremity compare placebo determine Biodex dynamometer assessment . 2 . Cycled continuous testosterone increase lean body mass muscle volume compare placebo determine DEXA MRI . 3 . Cycled continuous testosterone increase bone density compare placebo determine DEXA . The follow specific aim test randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial healthy , old men ( 60-75 year ) undergo 52 week cycle , continuous , placebo testosterone : 1 . To determine cycle continuous testosterone administration increase muscle strength compare placebo . 2 . To determine cycle continuous testosterone administration increase lean body mass muscle volume compare placebo . 3 . To determine cycle continuous testosterone administration increase bone density compare placebo . Our overall goal complete long-term study determine whether cycle testosterone achieves gain muscle bone function old men SOC , continuous testosterone administration . If hypothesis correct , investigator validate important paradigm shift testosterone administration old men help combat disability sarcopenia osteoporosis use half dose testosterone current SOC approach . This reduction testosterone dose lessen side effect improve safety testosterone administration healthy old men require androgen therapy .</detailed_description>
