	<brief_summary>Heart failure common , costly , disable potentially lethal condition . Despite well recognise prove drug therapy , many patient remain breathless exertion . A special pacemaker ( cardiac resynchronisation therapy ) may help improve symptom breathlessness survival restoring coordinate beating heart . However , despite careful plan knowledge appropriate selection criterion , third patient get desire beneficial effect pacemaker implant . The implantation special pacemaker require three lead ( wire ) insert within heart . Currently undertaken X-ray guidance . Some patient may scar heart muscle due previous heart attack underlie condition . The X-ray technique see therefore doctor may implant lead area scar tissue . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) demonstrate area scar . The study aim investigate whether CMR well predict wire place . The CMR picture take patient special pacemaker implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy ( CRT ) currently recommend patient heart failure symptomatic leave ventricular ( LV ) systolic impairment prolong QRS duration.1 , 2 Up third patient post CRT implantation derive anticipate clinical benefit . The reason multifactorial , patient selection successful LV lead implantation likely key factor . The mechanism CRT exert clinical benefit fundamentally correction mechanical dyssynchrony . However , despite much research area optimal measure dyssynchrony selection suitable candidate CRT establish . The current guideline revise light PROSPECT trial fail prove validity reproducibility complex echocardiographic variable dyssynchrony.3 The 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) remain widely use criterion assessment dyssynchrony patient consider CRT , patient broad QRS complex ( &gt; 150ms ) appear benefit most.4 , 5 Although definition leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) well establish , precise electrophysiological characteristic remain poorly understood . An arbitrary 'cut ' 120 millisecond recommend New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) 1948 definition.6 This subsequently become enshrined literature . The presence LBBB , heterogeneous entity , associated electrical mechanical abnormality within left ventricle.7 Septal lateral wall delay frequently occur set , delay activation lateral LV wall form basis bi-ventricular pacing . It well document within population leave ventricular impairment prolongation QRS complex associate adverse prognosis.8 The success CRT reliant upon achieve acceptable position leave ventricular lead implantation . The LV lead position need anatomically stable minimise risk lead displacement also avoid diaphragmatic capture . Furthermore , patient myocardial scar tissue lateral LV segment detect CMR known bad outcome follow CRT 9 pace site may potentially pro-arrhythmic.10 It known whether CMR guide placement LV lead order avoid sit myocardial scar fibrosis result improve clinical outcome patient . A recently publish study corroborate myocardial scar region activation LV lead may detrimental effect delivery CRT . A consecutive series 397 patient ischaemic cardiomyopathy image prior implantation CRT . Using complex echocardiographic technique 'speckle track ' , myocardial scar demonstrate adverse effect patient ' outcome . It remain independent predictor adverse clinical outcome . Notably due complexity technique , presence myocardial scar validate use CMR.11 CRT response contentious subject . It well recognise within literature approximately 30-40 % patient appear improve clinically follow CRT implantation.12 However , inter-study variability consider marker response wide several different variable utilised.13 Several study also small , single centre , non-randomised . There currently lack consensus constitute 'response ' vs 'non-response ' follow CRT , may either define term marker LV reverse remodelling change clinical index heart failure combination . In effort rationalise endpoint CRT trial , clinical composite score devise inclusive imaging base clinical endpoint . However , correlation LV remodelling clinical endpoint compare use correlation coefficient marginally good chance . The realisation clinical improvement post CRT implantation necessarily accompany mechanical remodelling also confused issue . Rationale Study The aim present study provide pilot data , result increase understanding mechanism CRT improve clinical outcome patient heart failure .</detailed_description>
