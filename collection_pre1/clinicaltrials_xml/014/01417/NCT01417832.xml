	<detailed_description>Fissure seal show inhibit formation occlusal caries also impede progression exist caries lesion . Lately , concept seal caries arrest lesion progression transfer approximal surface . In clinical study seal approximal lesion show significantly reduce progression 18 month compare treat preventive measure . The pore enamel caries lesion provide diffusion pathway acids dissolved mineral . The aim caries infiltration occlude pore infiltration light cure resin order block diffusion acid lesion body . In contrast caries seal , caries infiltration aim occlude pore within lesion rather place diffusion barrier lesion surface . Several study show significantly reduce progression infiltrate enamel lesion demineralize environment . This split-mouth placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conduct 16-35 year-old subject Bogot√° , Colombia ( IRB UB.162-2008 ) . The sample size calculate minimum 29 patient 3 approximal lesion around EDJ dentin outer third . The study population student patient Unversidad El Bosque . Two visit plan patient within week . In first visit baseline standardize bitewing radiograph obtain 3 proximal select lesion randomly select . A clinical examination conduct assess DMF-T/S , individual caries risk . Elastic orthodontic band place teeth select surface elective temporary separation . In second visit select lesion visually classify ICDAS criterion activity status lesion assess . The 3 lesion randomly allocate : A. Infiltration , B. Sealing , C. Placebo , lesion treat . Subjects clinically examine one , two , three year two examiner ( AC , JSL ) blind select treatment group referral operative treatment do need . Standardized bitewing radiograph make year . Lesions progression assess radiographs pair-wise reading external examiner blind group . Additionally , one year reading image conduct digital-subtraction radiography scan image . For reproducibility assessment examiner repeat 20 % radiograph reading method one week first reading . Statistical analysis Intra-examiner reliability radiograph reading assess unweighted kappa score ; caries experience ( DMF-T/S ) , individual caries risk level , ICDAS criterion , radiographic score , progression ' status select lesion report descriptively . The outcome variable change lesion progression 1 , 2 3 year assess pair-wise radiographic read one year also digital-subtraction radiography . Differences lesion progression treatment follow-up test Cochran Q test case significant difference group , McNemar Change test , include therapeutic effect 95 % confidence interval [ Siegel &amp; Castellan , 1988 ] . In test p-values le 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
