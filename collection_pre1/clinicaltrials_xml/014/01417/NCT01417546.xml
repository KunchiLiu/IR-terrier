	<brief_summary>Background : - The experimental drug NHS-IL12 may help immune system become active kill cancer cell respond standard treatment . NHS-IL12 design cause less severe side effect anticancer drug , may effective . More research need test NHS-IL12 people solid tumor respond treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness NHS-IL12 treatment solid tumor respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , image study . - Participants receive NHS-IL12 injection every 4 week , stay hospital least one day monitor frequent blood test . - Participants periodic blood sample take treatment first week treatment first two cycle . They blood sample take treatment rest cycle ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) proinflammatory cytokine produce activated phagocyte dendritic cell ( DCs ) play critical role regulate transition innate adaptive immunity . - IL-12 show promising clinical activity phase I trial , include stabilization disease renal cancer patient partial regression metastatic lesion , proceed clinical development due toxicity . - The NHS-IL12 concept strategy reduce toxicity associate systemic administration recombinant human IL-12 selectively target delivery tumor . The NHS-IL12 immunocytokine compose 2 IL-12 heterodimers , fuse one H-chains NHS76 antibody , affinity single- double-stranded DNA . Thus , NHS-IL12 target delivery region tumor necrosis DNA become expose . Objectives : - To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) NHS-IL12 administer subcutaneously every 4 week patient metastatic locally advanced solid epithelial mesenchymal tumor . - Secondary objective include explore pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity immune response subcutaneously administer NHS-IL12 . Based analysis immune response , preliminary fashion two expansion cohort repeat treatment , tumor response ( irRC ) progression free survival overall survival described . Eligibility : - Adults histologically cytologically proven metastatic locally advanced solid epithelial mesenchymal tumor , except unstable brain metastasis , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . - Adequate organ function define liver , kidney , hematologic laboratory test . - Patients acquire immune defect , systemic autoimmune disease , history organ transplant , history chronic infection , history active inflammatory bowel disease exclude . Design : - With Amendment D , phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study design assess safety , tolerability , PK , biological clinical activity NHS-IL12 . Goals determine MTD every 4 week dos start dose level 2mcg/kg NHS IL12 define biologically optimal treatment schedule . - Patients enrol cohort 3 6 patient use standard 3+3 approach MTD reach . - The trial include plan schedule-optimization amendment 12 patient 2 dose level great biologic interest ( MTD dose MTD ) , submit soon clear biological response ( change circulate cytokine level ) measure least 3 patient give dose level . - With maximum accrual ceiling 78 participant , study complete within 2-3 year , enrol 2 participant per month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet follow criterion participation : Patients must histologically confirm malignancy confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI , metastatic unresectable locally advanced solid epithelial mesenchymal tumor . Patients must complete disease progression least one prior line diseaseappropriate therapy metastatic disease , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease due underlie physical condition . Patients may disease measurable nonmeasurable evaluable disease ( e.g . present bone scan , rise tumor marker , nonmeasurable RECIST visible CT scan ) . Patients third space fluid ( example pleural effusion ) site disease eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 study entry . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use NHSIL12 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : 1 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : Absolute granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mcL Absolute lymphocyte count great equal 500/mcL Platelet count great equal 100,000/mcL hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL 2 . Adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin level less equal 1.5 time ULN patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanineaminotransferase ( ALT ) level less equal 2.5 time ULN , patient document metastatic disease liver , AST ALT level less equal 5 time ULN . 3 . Adequate renal function define estimate creatinine clearance great 60 mL/min determine 24hour urine sample CockcroftGault formula : Ccr = ( 140 age ) ( weight , kg ) ( constant ) / [ 72 time Crserum ( mg/100 mL ) . The constant 1 men 0.85 woman OR Ccr = ( 140 age ) ( weight , kg ) ( constant ) /Crserum ( micro mol/L ) . The constant 1.23 men 1.04 woman . CD4 lymphocyte count T lymphocyte subset count use determine eligibility . Patients must agree practice effective contraception ( male female subject , risk conception exists ) . The effect NHSIL12 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , 30 day last dose . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . A minimum 4 week require prior therapy , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation . In addition , recovery Grade 1 less reversible reversible toxicity relate prior therapy require study entry . Prior immune therapy ( e.g . relate vaccinia fowlpox vaccine antigenspecific peptide ) allow . Subject must sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow eligible participation study : Patients receive investigational concurrent anticancer treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , cytokine therapy except erythropoietin ) time enrollment except testosterone lower therapy men prostate cancer . Concurrent use systemic steroid ( within 10 day enrollment ) exclude , except physiologic dos systemic steroid replacement local ( topical , nasal , inhale ) steroid use . Limited dos systemic steroid ( e.g. , patient exacerations reactive airway disease ) must complete least 10 day prior enrollment . Steroid use prevent IV contrast allergic reaction anaphylaxis patient know contrast allergy allow time prior enrollment . Patients previously receive rIL12 Acquired immune defect HIV innate immunodeficiency agent require intact immune system . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowaltering therapy . Systemic autoimmune disease ( e.g. , lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , Addison disease , autoimmune disease associate lymphoma ) . History organ transplant . History active inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn disease , ulcerative colitis ) . Chronic infection ( e.g. , hepatitis B C , tuberculosis ) . Known hypersensitivity allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition study medication , recombinant IL12 monoclonal antibody Known hypersensitivity methotrexate History brain metastasis poor prognosis patient brain metastasis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( great equal NYHA III ) serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Pulmonary disease , opinion investigator , may impair patient respiratory tolerance moderate pulmonary fluid overload ( e.g. , interstitial lung disease , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . All condition associate significant necrosis nontumorbearing tissue : esophageal gastroduodenal ulcer &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , organ infarction &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , active ischemic bowel disease . Presence medically significant third space fluid ( symptomatic pericardial effusion , ascites pleural effusion require repetitive paracentesis ) . History active alcohol drug abuse . Any significant disease , opinion investigator , may impair patient tolerance study treatment . Significant dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Pregnancy ( absence confirm betahuman chorionic gonadotropin test ) lactation . Pleural effusion evidence metastatic disease .
