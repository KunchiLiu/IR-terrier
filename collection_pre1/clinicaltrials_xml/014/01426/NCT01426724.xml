	<brief_summary>Active form vitamin D analog use treat elevate parathyroid hormone level bone disease chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . More recent animal human study suggest treatment vitamin D may associate reduction inflammation urinary protein loss well reduction activity renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) addition effect bone metabolism . The investigator study use new technique contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEU ) measure flow blood kidney human study . In study , investigator investigate 3 month treatment active form vitamin D individual kidney disease high parathyroid hormone level would reduce protein loss urine . The investigator also look potential change blood flow kidney use CEU , kidney function ( GFR ) , inflammation activity RAS response treatment active form vitamin D. Finally , examine association reduction protein loss urine show study factor measure ( e.g , change blood flow inflammation ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening visit , ( Day 1 ) Most subject contact visit Kidney Center Clinic . In case , subject identify day visit nephrologists laboratory result available . If subject eligible participation study , screen visit occur Nephrology Clinical Research Center locate right next Kidney Center Clinic . The following occur screen visit , 1 . Inclusion exclusion criterion review 2 . Details study procedure review subject 3 . Informed consent sign subject enrol study . 4 . A physical exam perform . 5 . Vital Signs take ( blood pressure heart rate ) 6 . A urine pregnancy test perform woman child bear age . If positive subject exclude . 7 . If urine test proteinuria order clinic visit subject ' nephrologist , urine sample collect sent laboratory urine creatinine urine protein . 8 . Subjects ask present CRU within one week screen visit morning . 9 . Subjects ask start vitamin D pill prescribed nephrologists complete study visit 2 procedure . Visit 2 ( Day 2 - 7 ) . 1 . Eligibility review . 2 . A physical exam perform . 3 . Vital Signs take ( blood pressure heart rate ) 4 . A urine sample collect test , - Urine creatinine ( baseline ) - Urine protein ( baseline ) - Urine hcg check pregnancy woman child bear age - Urinalysis 5 . Subjects positive urine pregnancy test exclude 6 . A large bore intravenous catheter place peripheral vein purpose infusion Definity lock heparin . 7 . Blood sample collect time IV catheter placement . These sample check baseline concentration , - IL-1 , IL-6 , CRP , TNF-alpha - Plasma renin activity serum aldosterone - Basic metabolic panel - Serum albumin 8 . Subjects place continuous cardiac monitor pulse oximetry . If oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % subject exclude 9 . Subjects need lie bed back remain bed test procedure complete ( may use bedside commode ) . 10 . Resting ultrasonography perform kidney determine kidney volume , Doppler study do . 11 . Color Doppler subcostal view perform rule possibility intracardiac shunt . These individual exclude study . 12 . The Definity vial place room temperature use . It activate shake vial use Vialmax 45 second . It use immediately activation . 13 . 1.3 ml Definity mix 30 ml preservative free saline . Infusion Definity peripheral vein start 2 ml/min titrate optimal image quality ( exceed 10 ml/min time ) . 14 . To assess optimal microbubble concentration base upon video intensity , ultrasound image leave ventricle obtain use control . Microbubble administration titrate accordingly exceed 10 ml/min time . 15 . Baseline contrast ultrasound image right kidney perform use Power Modulation image low mechanical index ( MI ) 0.1 . 16 . One four impulse high MI 1.0 use destruct microbubbles image kidney low MI ( 0.1 ) continue several second minute . Infusion Definity stop point . 17 . During administration Definity , vital sign include heart rate pulse oximetry obtain continuously 18 . Study subject stay CRU 30 minute observation ( continuous ECG monitoring frequent blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate oxygen saturation monitoring continue period . 19 . A urine sample collect urinalysis . 20 . Subjects discharge home . 21 . At time discharge subject ask start take active vitamin D pill prescribe nephrologists . They ask inform u stop medication reason within next three month . 22 . Subjects ask start new blood pressure medication time study . They ask contact u change make medication . 23 . Between 48 - 72 hour discharge CRU subject contact assess adverse event . 24 . After three month treatment one form vitamin D , subject return CRU follow procedure , Visit 3 ( day 83 - 107 ) 90 Â± 10 day visit 1 25 . Eligibility review . 26 . A physical exam perform . 27 . Vital Signs take ( blood pressure heart rate ) 28 . A urine sample collect test , - Urine hcg check pregnancy woman child bear age - Urine creatinine ( end study ) - Urine protein ( end study ) - Urinalysis 29 . Women positive pregnancy test exclude 30 . A large bore intravenous catheter place peripheral vein purpose infusion Definity lock heparin . 31 . Blood sample collect time IV catheter placement . These sample check baseline concentration , - IL-1 , IL-6 , CRP , TNF-alpha - Plasma renin activity serum aldosterone - Basic metabolic panel - Serum albumin - Serum calcium , phosphorus intact PTH concentration , unless do standard care within week end study visit . 32 . Steps 6 - 20 mention repeat . 33 . Between 48 - 72 hour discharge CRU subject contact phone ass potential adverse event . 34 . Study procedure end time .</detailed_description>
