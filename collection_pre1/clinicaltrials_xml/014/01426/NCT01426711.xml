	<brief_summary>The care patient sepsis trauma require delivery appropriate definitive care early stage illness . Hospitals limited resource , rural underserved area South Carolina , may unable consistently provide optimal care patient . In addition , shortage specialist nationally make difficult hospital recruit retain specialist need . Patients area continue pay rural penalty poorer outcomes . This study provide specialist ' level care telemedicine consults rural emergency department rural area SC improve outcomes patient . The CREST study project specifically address need bring health care rural community SC , well evaluate method test technology implement care rural community . The CREST study use telemedicine remotely MUSC rural community hospital provide rural community physician care specialist trauma sepsis , high acuity , difficult treat condition . CREST multi-site trial telemedicine service meet rural patient ' provider ' need expert evaluation management sepsis trauma . The specific aim CREST : 1 . To test hypothesis telemedicine program include education clinical consultation tertiary care academic medical center rural , local hospital significantly improve key treatment decision outcome measure sepsis trauma . 2 . To test hypothesis difference ISS time antibiotic trauma sepsis patient expose telemedicine intervention without intervention match propensity score due unmeasured confounders . CREST seek new solution rural health disparity , advance technology , create retain job address important research opportunity combine implementation novel , trans disciplinary clinical program rigorous , mixed method scientific evaluation include clinical , process , economic outcome measure . The impact science quality healthcare outcomes broad CREST far reach implication address rural health disparity acute , life-threatening illness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The impetus CREST derive observation rural patient unlikely acquire on-site access appropriate specialist care high stake , high acuity , crisis-mode condition sepsis trauma . Novel , collaborative approach necessary provide rural patient access appropriate specialist care sepsis trauma . CREST innovative , technologically lever mechanism provide opportunity lessen inferior outcomes `` rural penalty '' pay patient rural community . Rural patient less likely onsite access specialist care sepsis trauma several reason : - Personnel : nation-wide shortage appropriate specialty provider include intensivists , trauma surgeon , critical care staff 1 . Small , rural community lack economy scale support resource intense service community specialty , often around clock coverage necessary best quality care condition 1 . - Physical material resource : Sepsis trauma patient require immediate availability resource multidisciplinary ICU staff , large blood bank , operate room , advance radiological facility . - Availability resource multidisciplinary ICU staff , large blood bank , operate room , advance radiological facility . - Location distance : Patients rural community inferior outcome sepsis trauma 2 , 3 . This likely multifactorial include delay entry Emergency Medical System network , long travel time definitive care facility delay definitive care delivery . Inter-hospital transfer may limit severity patient illness , acute care ICU bed shortage tertiary care center . Additionally , scarcity tertiary care hospital bed increase importance initiate transfer patient maximally benefit tertiary care referral 4 , 5 . The impact rural patient sepsis trauma , due lack access appropriate specialist care , substantial . Sepsis one common serious critical illness . It kill 28-50 % patient diagnose 6 , 7 10th leading cause death US 8 . Furthermore , incidence increase conjunction age US population 9 . The impact rurality sepsis receive modest investigation , rural patient likely bad outcomes.3 In SC , patient refer Emergency Departments ( ED 's ) small , typically rural hospital 22 % increase risk death compare refer ED 's large , urban hospital ( CREST preliminary analysis ) suggest benefit specialist direct care available patient large facility . Equally concern apparent race-associated disparity African American patient present rural ED 's SC twice likely discharged ED diagnosis sepsis compare white patient . Although rate discharge ED diagnosis sepsis low 3.95 % white 8.71 % African Americans ( CREST preliminary analysis ) , concern patient discharge ED diagnosis disparate rate may reflect well-described phenomenon unequal treatment 10 . Critically ill patient diagnosis benefit intensivist-directed care include 30-40 % reduction mortality.11 Unfortunately , half US hospital intensivist coverage rural hospital disproportionately affect problem 12 . Likewise , trauma lead cause death among Americans age 45 fourth lead cause death overall age 8 . Deaths injury occur tri-phasic distribution : 50 % deaths injury occur scene , 30 % occur first 1-2 hour 20 % occur hospitalization 1-2 week admission . Trauma care designate trauma center improve survival 13 . Yet , rural hospital rarely trauma center SC patient injured rural community inferior outcome high cost 14 . Significant disparity identify among SC 's elderly minority population . 14 An important barrier facilitate quality care SC trauma patient relate triage efficiency rural hospital trauma center . Outcomes seriously injured rural patient negatively affect patient take non-trauma EDs transfer trauma center 13 . Conversely , transfer patient low risk death disability trauma center represent over-triage , create additional stressor already busy trauma center accrue financial burden health care system . CREST scientifically innovative multiple level . It first prospective , mixed-methods evaluation telemedicine ; well one study remote/telemedicine sponsor industry . CREST first study demonstrate improve outcomes sepsis use telemedicine augment sparse literature trauma telemedicine . CREST also serve demonstration project show access specialist care rural patient high stake , high acuity condition reliably provide telemedicine . CREST technology non-proprietary relatively low cost thus allow important cost-effectiveness analysis ascertain viability telemedicine rural setting . CREST include two element - educational program rural provider clinical consultation patient sepsis trauma . Collaborating hospital receive telemedicine hardware software , usage instruction , 24/7 access MUSC expert sepsis trauma patient consultation real-time . This project use quasi-experimental design , incorporate control experiment use pre-existing patient group control . This design minimize threat external validity offer efficiency longitudinal aspect research . Main dependent measure include time initiation appropriate antibiotic septic patient reduce transfer rate less-severe trauma patient measure average increase Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) . Data collection control retrospective group prospective intervention group conduct use structure audit form trained staff . The research plan include investigation outcome , include treatment decision . Rural hospital primary target CREST institution tend few specialty provider often provide definitive care patient sepsis trauma . Eligible rural hospital strategically identify base several criterion . First , hospital locate rural area designate US Department Agriculture . Second , hospital substantial resource limitation indicate Level III IV Medical Facility Status Joint Accreditation Committee Hospital Organizations . Third , hospital within MUSC 's typical 120 mile catchment area . CREST investigator mindful importance collegial collaborative approach recruit rural hospital provider . To establish framework work relationship important success CREST , collaborate hospital MUSC sign Memorandum Agreement stipulate role expectation . The fundamental duty rural hospital : 1 ) work MUSC research team facilitate human subject approval CREST ; 2 ) coordinate provider ' availability CREST 's educational program ; 3 ) facilitate work relationship MUSC clinical expert appropriate clinician rural hospital 4 ) allow CREST investigator access patient record ascertain outcome measure . MUSC provide : 1 ) educational program 2 ) technical expertise equipment ; 3 ) 24/7 availability clinical evaluation ; 4 ) training support chart abstractor acquire outcome data ; 5 ) conducting analysis write report CREST . CREST allow rural spoke hospital 24/7 access MUSC sepsis trauma expert provide formal consultation patient condition include appropriate documentation medical record . Rural hospital utilize telemedicine consultant one-time basis initial evaluation recommendation request ongoing collaborative care MUSC clinical expert . If patient benefit transfer MUSC , identify MUSC clinician already familiar patient 's clinical status , represent another advantage telemedicine service . Alternatively , patient adequately manage refer spoke site determine , thus improve triage efficiency tertiary care referral .</detailed_description>
