	<brief_summary>Although progress chemotherapy metastatic gastric cancer , standard regimen adjuvant chemotherapy available , many clinical trial produce contradictory result . The majority randomize clinical trial study adjuvant chemotherapy gastric cancer underpowered , involve low-volume center , use ineffective chemotherapy regimen . As result , well-designed multicenter trial still need . The ACTS-GC trial , demonstrate efficacy S-1 stage II-III gastric cancer patient underwent curative resection extend lymph-node dissection ( D2 ) , may valid country D2 surgery consider standard care . S-1 improved 3-year overall survival 70.1 % surgery alone 80.1 % . However , 3-year overall survival stage IIIA stage IIIB patient receive S-1 77.4 % 63.4 % , respectively , less satisfactory compare rate stage II ( 90.7 % ) . Based unsatisfactory outcome among late stage patient ACTS-GC adjuvant trial , investigation need effective postoperative treatment patient stage IIIB IV ( M0 ) cancer . Therefore , researcher investigate efficacy safety S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy patient curatively resect gastric adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S-1 Versus S-1 Plus Cisplatin Adjuvant Chemotherapy Treat Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This control study design evaluate efficacy S-1 survival compare S-1 plus cisplatin . Patients randomly assign receive either surgery follow treatment S-1 plus cisplatin surgery follow treatment S-1 within 42 day curative resection . To assess efficacy , data recurrence survival collect time enrollment 5 year surgery . To evaluate safety , data adverse event collect time enrollment 1 year surgery .</detailed_description>
