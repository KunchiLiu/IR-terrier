	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine following : response rate ( include pathological CR rate ) , TTP , complication treatment patient rectal cancer treat FOLFOX bevacizumab , alteration tumor blood flow ( assessed DCE-MRI percentage change Ktrans ) 1 cycle bevacizumab therapy compare baseline value patient treat FOLFOX alone treat bevacizumab 5 mg/kg. , degree hypoxis ( measure tumor uptake 2-nitroimidazole EF5 ) induce bevacizumab treatment relationship change tumor blood flow , degree apoptosis ( measure tumor uptake di-annexin V ) induce bevacizumab treatment relationship change tumor blood flow . The secondary objective study determine exploratory fashion relationship tumor blood flow , hypoxia induction , apoptosis induction , time progression patient continue receive Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg , analyze archival tumor patient treat trial mutation MKK7 SEK1 gene , semi-quantitative IHC relevant protein , determine relationship vascular proliferation measure DCE-MRI marker endothelial cell proliferation , obtain pilot data whether assay measure vascular endothelial cell mitogenic stimulation mitogenic activity may predict response therapy , time progression overall survival patient receive bevacizumab 5 mg/kg .</detailed_description>
