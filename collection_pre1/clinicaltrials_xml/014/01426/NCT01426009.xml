	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , four-period , incomplete block design cross-over study use EP-101 ( SUN101 ) open-label active control ( tiotropium bromide ipratropium bromide ) . The study population consist subject 40-75 year age moderate severe COPD . Approximately 133 subject diagnose moderate severe COPD enrol order achieve minimum 105 subject complete study . Following run-in phase , subject randomly assign one 7 treatment sequence , sequence comprise four 7-day Treatment Periods . There washout period 7 day Treatment Period . Study visit conduct Days 1 7 Treatment Period , overnight stay require clinic visit . A Final Study Visit conduct 7 day follow last study treatment . During Treatment Period , study treatment administer daily ( QD ) , except ipratropium inhalation solution , administer three time daily ( TID ) . EP-101 ( SUN101 ) active placebo treatment administer use investigational high-efficiency eFlow® nebulizer . Tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva® ) administer open-label manner via Handihaler® dry-powder inhaler ( DPI ) . Ipratropium bromide inhalation solution administer open-label manner via general purpose nebulizer . This study previously post Elevation Pharmaceuticals , Inc.
