	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best way give dasatinib cyclosporine treat patient chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) refractory intolerant imatinib mesylate . Dasatinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cyclosporine may help dasatinib work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving dasatinib together cyclosporine may effective treatment CML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Cyclosporine Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Refractory Intolerant Imatinib Mesylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define safety tolerability cyclosporine A combination dasatinib adult Bcr-Abl+ chronic myelogenous leukemia chronic phase , use specify patient accelerated phase CML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacokinetic parameter dasatinib combine cyclosporine . II . To assess whether combination dasatinib cyclosporine alters T cell number function . III . To assess feasibility determine phosphorylation Src peripheral blood mononuclear cell flow cytometry surrogate measure dasatinib activity . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 cyclosporine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 8-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo peripheral blood sample collection baseline periodically treatment pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study T-cell number function flow cytometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
