	<brief_summary>In Investigator Initiated study , investigator want explore potential induction therapy Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -blocking agent early disease stage ( le 3 month symptom duration ) patient predominant peripheral spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) , classify accord new Assessment SpondyloArthritis ( ASAS ) -criteria . The hypothesis would treatment TNF-blocker early ( `` immature '' ) stage disease would result significant high number patient clinical remission compare placebo , - comparable early Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) patient BeSt-study - long-term treatment would necessary maintain remission number patient . In placebo-controlled , double blind , randomize study ( open-label phase , start week 24 ) sixty patient fulfil Assessment SpondyloArthritis ( ASAS ) criteria peripheral spondylarthritis enrol . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio ( 2 golimumab :1 placebo ) . During placebo-controlled phase , 50mg golimumab , placebo administrate subcutaneously ( SC ) every 4 week week 20 . Subjects treat open-label Golimumab 50 mg SC injection week 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 48 . If patient 'clinical remission ' ( clinical remission define absence arthritis , enthesitis dactylitis clinically two major consecutive visit . Visits plan week 12 , week 24 , week 36 week 48 ) treatment stop . In case clinical relapse , patient treat open-label golimumab 50 mg SC . Patients sustain clinical remission observe assess possibility maintain drug-free remission . The study duration 48 week .</brief_summary>
