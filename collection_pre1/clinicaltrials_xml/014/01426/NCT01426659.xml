	<brief_summary>The preterm child difficulty minor neurological developmental general population even without cerebral palsy . Their oral language difficulty language write little studied . The investigator propose study speak language 3 year 1/2 stimulate ( depend randomization ) child phonological weakness notemment language . The investigator evaluate stimulation protocol imply short precise language re-education `` say '' 20 session . A new evaluation language ( BILO N-EEL ) , sensorimotor cognitive constraint ( KABC ) perform 4 year . Early intervention basis precise language closing window developmental ( &lt; 5 year ) expect improve result language cognitive development preterm infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Very premature baby bear 32 week gestation developmental problem important rest population . The study report 40 % Epipage neuromotor difficulty vary severity . Children cerebral palsy 9 % 6 % . However rate minor neurological problem school failure increase . Neurocognitive difficulty many , visuospatial dyspraxia , attention disorder , language impairment . The latter fairly describe literature seem often see population relation overall cognitive difficulty . Cognitive assessment overall K-ABC former premature study Epipage nevertheless often normal . Oral language fundamental write language learn school follow mature development stage accord specific sensorimotor well know . The investigator hypothesize minor sensorimotor disorder population premature infant without CP change structurally early oral language , include phonology . Accurate assessment component language 3 year premature child without CP neurosensory disorder find ( blindness , deafness ) already allow u observe weaknesses structural component language . These early failure may correspond particular neurological architecture language observe functional MRI population child age 8 12 year ( Schaer 2009 , Petterson 2002 ) may sensitive specific stimulation early developmental window architecture speak language close ( Newport 2002 ) . Objective : To evaluate interest accurate early stimulation imply short ( `` say '' ) area weakness language 3ans1 / 2 former preterm infant without CP spot BILO . Method : This prevention trial national , multicenter , prospective randomize two arm . In study , 296 patient premature frailty oral language without CP , without minor neurological disorder , without proven pathology oral language include 5 hospital randomize receive specific stimulation ( say `` ) . The assessment oral language Computerized Assessment BILO1 ( Khomsa 2008 ) Â½ 3 year offer parent child CP follow without neurosensory disorder current fact . After obtain consent , result BILO , direct therapist trained order define criterion frailty , randomization do centrally . Early stimulation precise short ( 20 therapy session per week ) area weaknesses language drive compare absence specific stimulation . Evaluation 6 month result blind . Inclusion schedule 24 month inclusion patient result define area weakness BILO1dans one component language : item &lt; 10th percentile / two item &lt; 25th percentile ) . . Excluding child pathological score BILO1 ( &lt; 3rd percentile least one criterion ) include Primary endpoint : difference baseline six month phonology BILO score ( score 0 16 list ) Number subject statistical power : 170 child year bear preterm live CHU Rouen . One hundred follow accept study conduct service center collaborate study EPIPAGE ( Lancet 2008 ) . According preliminary work half present language problem 3 year . Thus , 50 child per year would candidate study 10 % pathological oral language therefore exclude study . 296 child include five center accord follow-up rate accord proportion . Three center follow-up preterm 80/an regional 30/an . According preliminary data , assume moderate correlation 0.5 BILO score baseline six month , standard deviation primary endpoint 4.7 unit phonology BILO score . Thus , test risk first kind b = 5 % bilateral formulation , total 296 child include evaluate ( 148 child per group ) detect statistical power 90 % , size effect 0.379 , difference 1.8 unit average score BILO groupes . Ainsi two , number choose detect high power low difference two group primary . Statistical analysis : The mean primary endpoint compare group one-tailed test usual 5 % . This test complete compare adjust base multiple linear regression model take account possible prognostic factor ( duration gestation , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , neurological disorder minor , socio-economic status ... ) , center initial value ( 3 year ) score phonology . The difference mean two group confidence interval 95 % estimate . Outlook : Creating cohort follow analyze impact early stimulation specific age 6 assess level prevention disorder oral write language .</detailed_description>
