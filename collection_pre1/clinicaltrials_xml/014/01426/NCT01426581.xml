	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate relative effectiveness two different way teach subject hospitalize use respiratory inhaler follow-up discharge home hospital determine durability education . Teach-to-Goal ( TTG ) education employ instruction follow patient `` teach-back , '' repeat cycle learn assessment skill master . By contrast , Brief Intervention ( BI ) education consist provide patient verbal write instruction . The investigator hypothesize hospital-based TTG compare BI increase patient 's ability retain instruction respiratory inhaler technique . The investigator test hypothesis separately MDI Diskus® device discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Interventions Teach Respiratory Inhaler Technique ( E-TRaIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory inhaler often use incorrectly patient obstructive lung disorder ( include patient hospitalized exacerbation asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . As mainstay bronchodilator anti-inflammatory therapy patient OLD , implication difficulty self-management patient risk under-treatment bad health outcome . Several factor think contribute poor self-management skill , particularly inadequate patient education healthcare encounter inadequate patient health literacy . However , effective strategy instruct patient respiratory inhaler use hospital setting unclear , particularly population enrich inadequate health literacy . Therefore , overall goal study evaluate relative effectiveness two hospital-based educational intervention : Teach-To-Goal ( TTG , iterative cycle demonstration-based education assessment ) versus Brief Intervention ( BI , one-time set verbal instruction ) durability instruction provide hospital effect clinical outcome ( e.g. , respiratory event and/or death ) , post hospital discharge . The investigator also plan evaluate whether relative effectiveness TTG vs. BI varies level health literacy . The objective proposal conduct study adult hospitalize asthma/COPD 1 ) evaluate relative effectiveness hospital-based TTG versus BI patient ' ability retain instruction correct use MDI Diskus® device discharge home 2 ) To determine relative effectiveness TTG compare BI patient less-than-adequate health literacy compare adequate health literacy . These data inform development large , multi-center clinical trial .</detailed_description>
