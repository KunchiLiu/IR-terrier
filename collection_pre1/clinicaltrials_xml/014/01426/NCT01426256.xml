	<brief_title>Vitamin D Enhancing Immune System Cystic Fibrosis ( DISC Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) short life span general population due complication lung infection , eventually progress lung failure . New research suggest high level vitamin D may protective lung infection may promote action anti-bacterial protein need ward infection . Research also suggest high vitamin D level link low mortality rate ; however hypotheses adequately studied patient CF . An investigation effect vitamin D supplementation particular interest population patient CF generally high rate vitamin D deficiency . The investigator preliminary data previous study suggest vitamin D supplementation patient CF lower marker inflammation , promote anti-bacterial protein , reduces mortality . In propose multi-center study investigator examine effect high dose vitamin D supplementation patient CF admit hospital lung infection . The investigator use randomize , placebo-controlled trial design determine mortality infection rate 1 year reduce patient receive high-dose vitamin D supplementation compare receive placebo . The investigator also determine vitamin D affect marker inflammation anti-bacterial protein , well CF-related clinical outcome , lung function . The investigator plan recruit 280 adult adolescent CF ( age &gt; 16yrs ) , approximately 150 subject recruit Emory ( Emory University Hospital Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ) . Participants initially see study researcher first week in-patient hospitalization , follow course one year regularly-scheduled out-patient CF clinic visit . The treatment group receive initial oral bolus dose 250,000 IU vitamin D , 3 month follow-up receive 50,000 IU vitamin D every week . Current CF Guidelines vitamin D supplementation recommend daily intake 800 IU vitamin D per day , therefore addition vitamin D placebo receive begin study 3 month , participant receive 800 IU vitamin D daily . If hypothesis correct , study potential reduce infection promote survival patient CF use vitamin D , relatively inexpensive supplement .</detailed_description>
