	<detailed_description>The current obstetrical practice birth United States umbilical cord low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant clamp immediately . When immediate cord clamping occur , 50 % fetal-placental blood volume may leave placenta acutely increase vulnerability hypovolemia ( low blood volume ) . In investigator previous randomize control trial , find infant receive simple delay umbilical cord clamp 30-45 second experience significantly low incidence bleed brain few systemic infection throughout Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) stay high score muscular control function 7 month correct age . In investigator current Phase 2 randomize control trial , examines motor function infant randomize immediate cord clamping ( ICC ) delay cord clamping ( DCC ) 7 month correct age ( age base due date pre-term birth rate ) . Our objective new grant Thrasher Foundation examine difference long-term effect ICC vs. DCC developmental outcome study infant 18-22 month correct age . The investigator hypothesis positive effect DCC , less bleed brain less infection , may also result good motor mental function 18-22 month correct age . Differentiation cognitive motor function obvious develop toddler young infant . The diagnosis cerebral palsy become definitive age cognitive skill expressive receptive language continue emerge .</detailed_description>
