	<detailed_description>This research study design determine effect functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) row drug call zoledronic acid bone health individual suffer spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The investigator hop learn zoledronic acid treatment would increase bone mineral density person chronic spinal cord injury . This design conduct three center study multiple investigator . The investigator also goal find zoledronic acid safe person SCI without cause many side effect . The Prime recipient funding Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital ( SRH ) . Dr. Leslie Morse Principal Investigator study , coordination study locate Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital . Through sub-award research group Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System contract conduct DXA scan , blood draw zoledronic acid administration support study . Through another sub-award SRH , another Investigator Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) participate conduct CT scan study . All adverse event relate study monitor record investigator SRH . Seventy subject age 18 year old wheelchair dependent least 50 % time SCI enrol . Enrollment initial screening study follow perform SRH . After enrollment subject randomize 1 ) FES-rowing alone 2 ) FES-rowing plus 1-time infusion zoledronic acid . Following variable period strength training necessary preparing quad hamstring extend FES use , enrol participant plan begin regular row program 12 month Cardiovascular Laboratory Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital . DXA scan measure bone mineral density plan perform VA Boston Healthcare System-Jamaica Plain Campus ( VABHS ) three time study participant . In addition , 25 subject arm study plan receive CT scan knee MGH begin end study . Up 20 subject additional CT scan ( MGH ) six month row . Research blood sample plan collect VABHS five time duration study store VA study molecular marker bone turnover . All participant expect screen renal function calcium vitamin D level begin end study , additional renal screen do zoledronic acid infusion . Calcium vitamin D supplement provide subject throughout study . Those insufficient vitamin D level provide additional repletion plan periodically rechecked . Up 15 male subject ask two echocardiogram one SRH sit - one beginning study halfway year-long row regimen .</detailed_description>
