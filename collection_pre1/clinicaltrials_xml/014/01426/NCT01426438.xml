	<brief_summary>This study do people HIV infection low level HDL-C. HDL-C type `` good '' cholesterol . People low HDL-C higher risk heart disease may problem blood vessel relax . The endothelium inner line blood vessel , artery vein . When endothelium work properly , blood vessel trouble expand properly , contributes development heart blood vessel disease . The main purpose study see take either extended-release niacin fenofibrate 24 week help blood vessel work well improve endothelial function increase HDL-C. Niacin fenofibrate medication raise HDL-C . This study also help determine safe extended-release niacin fenofibrate . The analysis as-treated analysis participant complete study treatment week 24 BART scan . Safety analysis include participant</brief_summary>
