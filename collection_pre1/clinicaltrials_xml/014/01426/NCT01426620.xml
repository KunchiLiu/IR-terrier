	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate feasibility use blueberry powder ( rich anthocyanidins ) adjunct therapy conventional chemotherapy drug paclitaxel/docetaxel treatment NSCLC . The study base information publish study blueberry anthocyanidins ( bioflavonoids give blueberry color ) show regulate vast array molecular target , excite compel preliminary data show blueberry anthocyanidins elicit potent synergistic chemo-sensitizing effect two highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line .</detailed_description>
