	<brief_title>Men Together Making Difference : Reducing HIV/STD Risk Behavior Among South African Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sub-Saharan Africa 10 % world 's population , accord UNAIDS home 60 % people live HIV 2003—some 25.4 million people . South Africa continue large number people live HIV world . As part sub-Saharan Africa , heterosexual exposure primary HIV transmission category . An estimated 5.3 million South Africans—2.9 million woman 2.4 million men—were live HIV end 2003 . Worldwide , effort stem spread HIV among heterosexual stress impact HIV woman . Oft-cited statistic indicate half people live HIV woman . It often suggest woman seldom free make empower choice face range HIV-related vulnerability men face—many embed social relation economic reality society . Women 's economic dependence male partner fact woman power abstain sex insist condom use—even suspect man sexual partner might HIV—is emphasize . The hazard young woman 's sexual relationship old men high rate rape form sexual coercion cite . Men typically mention injection drug user , sex men—whether MSMs `` low '' —or cause spread HIV woman . The strategy typically offer address impact HIV woman intervention woman . For instance , recommend woman taught information skill make decision term sexual relationship , method protection woman control ( e.g. , microbicides ) develop , boost woman 's economic opportunity social power see part parcel potentially successful sustainable HIV prevention strategy . To sure , alternative approach address woman 's risk heterosexual transmission HIV , one would important complement predominant approach : namely , focus men . Although noted HIV affect woman severely place heterosexual exposure dominant mode transmission , seldom lead recommendation intervention develop change men 's behavior . Yet , reduce men 's sexual risk behavior , possible reduce rate HIV men woman . Men 's rate would decline recipient intervention ; woman 's rate would decline sex men . Interventions target men could take account power men sexual decision-making risk taking . However , whether one considers US literature international literature , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention target heterosexual men . Elwy colleague 2002 review HIV/STD prevention intervention study reveal 12 1157 study worldwide conduct male . Most RCTs demonstrate intervention efficacy . Only 2 demonstrate significant effect mediator behavior , neither RCT . In addition , scant attention focus general population heterosexual men region . Indeed , 8 12 study focus incarcerated men , STD patient , substance abuser , miner , truck driver . To address gap literature , propose trial focus men representative general population . In many develop country , include South Africa , HIV/AIDS epidemic generalize , need develop test intervention broad range population , special high-risk sub-populations . Accordingly , purpose research develop test efficacy intervention reduce behavior create risk contract transmit STD , include HIV , among South African men sex woman . A cluster-randomized control trial design use reduce potential contamination treatment arm would present individual randomize . An attention control group use control Hawthorne effect , special attention , group interaction . Men recruit Black township surround East London , include Mdantsane , Scenery Park , Duncan , Village , Gompo Town , semi-rural area Berlin Eastern Cape Province South Africa . More 98 % resident area Black Africans , isiXhosa first language 98.8 % population . There 206 neighborhood define geographical cluster tie census data catchment area , allow creation 103 match pair neighborhood similar percentage isiXhosa-speaking , percentage marry , percentage male , percentage living informal dwelling , percentage unemployed , population size . From 103 matched pair , 22 pair randomly select trial . One neighborhood pair randomly assign 2 study arm . Before recruit neighborhood , meeting community leader ( e.g. , councilor , clergy ) hold enlist support . In addition , meet hold inform men neighborhood study . Recruiters inform potential participant study , obtain consent screen , conduct brief screen interview determine eligibility willingness participate . Eligible men invite participate `` Men , Together Making A Difference Project '' design understand men 's behavior may create health risk heart disease , cancer , STDs , especially HIV , find way teach men reduce risk . A common participant recruitment enrollment protocol , include use poster material , follow neighborhood condition . Eligible men recruit advance randomization time agree participate blind specific intervention receive . This procedure reduce probability self-selection bias different condition trial . All participant complete self-report measure via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing intervention , immediately , 6 12 month intervention . Several step take increase validity self-report measure . Participants give calendar , date clearly mark . This make salient respondent date include ask recall behavior `` past 3 month '' specific . The importance respond honestly emphasize . They inform response use create program South African men like possible answer question honestly . This pit social responsibility motive social desirability motive . Participants assure response keep confidential . Facilitators lead intervention group involve way data collection . The use ACASI also serve increase participant ' motivation respond accurately . There 2 Specific Aims . Aim 1 test primary hypothesis men receive culturally appropriate theory-based HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention likely report consistently use condom vaginal intercourse 12-month post intervention period men receive attention-control intervention . Aim 2 test secondary hypothesis outcome expectancy self-efficacy use condom mediate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention 's effect condom use . In addition , exploratory aim conduct hypothesis-generating analyse whether efficacy intervention varies depend neighborhood characteristic participant ' baseline characteristic . The effect HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention may differ function neighborhood 's unemployment rate , percentage living informal dwellings/shacks , percentage marry , sex ratio . Potential individual-level moderator include age , marital status , language use ( English versus isiXhosa ) , alcohol drug use . The unit inference trial individual . This trial design test efficacy behavior-change intervention base individual-level behavior change theory . As Donner Klar 2000 note influential textbook cluster-randomized trial , unit inference , unit randomization , determines unit analysis . The data analyze use intention-to-treat mode , participant analyze base intervention assignment , regardless number intervention data-collection session attend . The primary aim focus test significant difference two treatment condition post intervention period . Major statistical challenge arise proper handling repeat clustered outcome . Each variable interest complete man , nest within neighborhood , thus create correlate outcome . Moreover , multiple assessment variable study period produce correlate repeated outcome . The primary challenge analysis data appropriate adjustment differential treatment mean cluster correlation among observation within cluster ( cluster effect ) . Most statistical model assume stochastic independence among observation thus inappropriate cluster data . In trial , generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) model employ handle cluster data appropriately . GEE model avoids explicit model within-cluster correlation base statistical inference model parameter marginalize likelihood generalize estimating equation . Since GEE require relatively large sample size , appropriate small study . Given large sample size , GEE appropriate trial . The implementation trial relatively straightforward . For instance , determine whether great percentage men receive HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention report consistent condom use 6 12 month post intervention , compare receive health-promotion intervention , model include time-independent covariates , baseline measure consistent condom use , intervention type , time ( 2 category represent 6- 12-month follow-up ) , provide effect intervention 2 follow-up visit . A sample size calculation perform detect priori effect size 10 % increase consistent condom use 32 % 42 % HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention condition , adjust expect variance inflation due clustering . A 10 % increase select clinically substantively important effect size . Based pilot data , intraclass correlation ( ICC ) 0.01 estimate . Assuming alpha = 0.05 , 2-tailed test , ICC = 0.01 , 15 % attrition 12-month follow-up , N = 1,152 men trial 44 neighborhood average 26 men neighborhood , trial estimate 81 % power detect 10 % increase consistent condom use 32 % 42 % HIV/STD intervention group . Assuming effect size , hypothesis test secondary sexual behavior outcomes theoretical mediator variable similar statistical power .</detailed_description>
