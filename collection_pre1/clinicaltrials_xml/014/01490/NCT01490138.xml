	<brief_summary>Invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) disease usually occur patient compromise immune condition , acute leukemia , allogeneic stem cell transplantation long term immune suppression treatment incidence increase last decade . Given introduction numerous anti-fungal agent great advance make recent year , IFI still dangerous disease high mortality . Early diagnosis IFI still problem challenge physician . Serum test β-D-Glucan introduced diagnosis IFI , advantage easy application . However , value test monitoring antifungal treatment remain unclear . The investigator perform study evaluate correlation serum test result β-D-Glucan test treatment response anti-fungal treatment , hope see result serial serum test good predictive marker treatment response .</brief_summary>

Patients must satisfy follow criterion enter study : 1 . Episode proven probable IFI , diagnose accord EORTC/MSG definition ; 2 . Immunocompromised HSCT chemotherapy malignant hematopathy ; 3 . ≥ 2 consecutive positive serum glucan level , use threshold positivity ≥ 60 ng/L , start antifungal therapy . If fungal infection patient exclude confirm specific pathogen fungi enrollment/during study period , excluded/withdrew study .</criteria>
