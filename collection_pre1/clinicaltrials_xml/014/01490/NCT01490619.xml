	<brief_title>Resilience Promotion Teens With Type 1 Diabetes : Preventing Negative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Scope Problem : Adolescents type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) must balance complex daily treatment regimen also face emotional , social academic demand developmental period . Not surprisingly , adolescent increase risk anxiety depressive symptom , poor cop problem-solving skill , poor regimen adherence , negative diabetes-specific health outcome . The mental physical health risk T1D add already staggering economic burden ; annual cost diabetes United States direct medical care exceed $ 116 billion individual diabetes twice healthcare cost peer without diabetes . A handful psychological intervention target adolescent ' poor behavioral emotional functioning demonstrate beneficial effect disease management outcome . However , prevention program exist equip adolescent behavioral skill cognitive strategy show reduce risk poor psychological functioning risk negative health outcome time . Although none effective prevention program develop healthy youth adapt adolescent T1D , Penn Resilience Program ( PRP ) viable candidate well-established prevention program show promote resilience prevent depression . The current study test diabetes-specific adaptation PRP adolescent T1D fill significant gap scientific literature . This study 's significance lie focus prevent depression , prevalent , critical factor influence diabetes-specific health outcome , also emphasis ultimately prevent suboptimal glycemic control , common , expensive , dangerous problem pediatric diabetes . Individuals depression diabetes incur 4.5 time health care cost diabetes alone . The focus intervention resilience promotion innovative potential fundamentally change risk depression set adolescent trajectory toward improved adherence health outcome . Moreover , document mechanism change impact critical psychosocial health outcome youth T1D via longitudinal , randomize , control design facilitates generalizability chronically ill population give similar management demand individual family , association depression . 2 . Summary Procedures : Investigators employ randomize , control design compare PRP T1D diabetes education intervention , ( EI ; develop two CDE 's , specifically focus adolescent learn adolescent need ) resilience characteristic , depressive symptom , adherence behavior , glycemic outcome . Investigators recruit 280 adolescent T1D across two city ( Chicago Cincinnati ) , measure outcome baseline , post-intervention , five surveillance visit span additional 24 month . All adolescent participate 9 session , last approximately 90 minute session . Assessments occur baseline ( 0 month ) , post-intervention ( 4.5 month ) , surveillance period ( 8 , 12 , 16 , 28 month ) . PRP T1D lead master 's level graduate student enrol clinical psychology PhD program . EI lead CDE nurse . This EI group preferable either untreated control wait-list control group allow experimental control attention , peer group session , dose treatment outcome . Both program leader receive 20 hour train program leading . Data Collection Measures . Measures assess two primary outcome ( depressive symptom glycemic control ) two mechanism change ( resilience adherence ) . Assessments occur baseline , post-intervention ( 4.5 month ) , 4 surveillance visit ( 8 , 12 , 16 , 28 month ) . To keep participant burden manageable level increase retention rate , eligible family invite complete questionnaire secure web-site access research study staff , home , work , public library clinic . Investigators use SNAP Survey Software system , allow electronic completion survey data directly transfer data management software HIPAA-protected framework . The SNAP software eliminates need manual data entry , reduce risk miss data well reduce risk violate confidentiality data . Hemoglobin A1c collect via small sample blood send central laboratory . The Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory University Missouri ( http : //www.diabetes.missouri.edu/ ) use . This laboratory serve reference laboratory DCCT NHANES III IV study . They extensive experience serve central laboratory A1c value . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ; iPro sensor transmitter Medtronic ) ass glycemic variability . The certified diabetes educator ( CDE ) study physician assist participant insertion calibration device . For study , adolescent blind CGM value safety reason ; want participant adjust insulin level dietary intake base sensor reading . Adolescents wear sensor transmitter 3 day . After use , sensor/transmitter collect research team via pre-paid mailing container . Once transmitter return , data download study computer , typically 290 value per day . Investigators calculate three indicator glycemic variability : SD mean sensor value , mean amplitude glycemic excursion ( MAGE ) , percentage time spend within glucose range . The amount time spend `` within target '' ( value 70 180 ) , `` target '' ( value 70 ) , `` target '' ( value 180 ) calculate . All three indicator well-established metric glycemic variability . Enhancing Treatment Fidelity . Per NIH Behavior Change Consortium,27 randomize , control design effective mechanism find treatment effect . Further , vital insure intervention deliver proposed participant receive treatment dose within across intervention condition . To achieve , Investigators make uniform reminder call , use treatment manual , interventionists meet every week study PIs group supervision discus relevant topic , problem area , plan future session . Sessions audio tap relevant point discuss supervision . Ratings audiotapes conduct PIs 25 % session , base list key component . Frequent staff training key deliver intervention intend prevent drift . Therefore , staff training occur twice annually year 1-3 annually year 4-5 . Study PIs coordinate training deliver collectively PIs co-investigators . Training cover delivery prevention program , coordinator activity ( e.g. , process blood sample A1c ) , treatment fidelity . 3 . Risks : The risk study minor many intervention component employ previously research clinical setting minimal adverse event . The risk come along study emotional behavioral factor discuss include possibility discomfort complete questionnaire discussion intervention session . Further , give nature diabetes management , stress patient-parent conflict may occur uncontrolled blood sugar document . The research staff train identify distress discomfort early provide support intervention . Patients agree participate study experience usual risk associate treatment type 1 diabetes : significant risk hypoglycemia , present patient undergo treatment diabetes insulin . Another risk associate study threat privacy confidentiality secure website somehow breach . However SNAP software system secure web-site reviewed approve CMH 's IT officer ( Ron Isbell Jason Ruprecht ) CMH 's PHI officer ( Valerie Witmer ) , PI use secure website another study without difficulty . Participants access questionnaire secure web-site participant assign unique study ID code number . Names , initial identify information use measure . There may unknown risk investigator monitor . An additional risk potential threat privacy confidentiality . Investigators believe represent minimal risk define DHHS office Human Research Protection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study participant meet follow inclusion criterion : 1418 year old , diagnosis T1D accord ADA criterion least 1 year , daily insulin dose least 0.5 unit per kilogram per day , fluent English , provide assent participate . chronic , physical disease condition except celiac thyroid disease , diagnosis major depressive disorder determine screen visit , current treatment antidepressant , diagnosis major mental disorder ( e.g. , bipolar disorder , think disorder , anorexia nervosa ) , diagnosis developmental disorder ( e.g. , mental retardation , autism , asperger 's ) , ward state . Adolescents must establish T1D , uncomplicated chronic disease observe change glycemic control study attribute disease endogenous insulin production see 'honeymoon ' period.28 Adolescents diagnosis major depressive disorder diagnosis warrant intensive intervention . Further , adolescent antidepressant medication treatment time start trial may impact psychological outcome cause unmeasured treatment effect . Finally , adolescent need without developmental learn problem may make participation difficult , especially group format .</criteria>
