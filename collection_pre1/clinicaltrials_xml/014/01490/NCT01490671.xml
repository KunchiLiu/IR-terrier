The purpose study evaluate safety 1 % tenofovir gel HIV-uninfected pregnant woman use late first trim second trimester pregnancy . Participants healthy , HIV-uninfected pregnant woman randomly assign use either 1 % tenofovir gel placebo gel day 28 day delivery , whichever come first . Participants divide four group vary gestational age range . These group fill sequentially , start later gestational age ( close time delivery ) group first . Once safety group confirm , group participant earlier gestational age enrol . Length participation study vary depend gestational age time enrollment , participant visit study entry ; Days 7 , 14 , 28 ; 2 week last dose assign gel ; every 4 week delivery . Participants use gel within 24 hour arrive hospital delivery also delivery visit . At visit , participant give medical history ; undergo blood urine collection ; physical exam , include obstetric ( OB ) abdominal pelvic exam .
