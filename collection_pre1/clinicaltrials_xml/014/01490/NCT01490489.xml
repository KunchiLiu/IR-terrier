	<brief_title>EG-VEGF : Potential Marker Pre-eclampsia / Intrauterine Growth Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful human placentation depend adequate transformation uteroplacental vasculature extravillous trophoblast ( EVT ) follow proliferation , migration , invasion cell maternal decidua . This process vascular remodelling rise peak end first trim decline rapidly thereafter . Poor invasion lead development pathological condition Pre-eclampsia ( PE ) intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) . PE affect 5-6 % pregnancy France cause death ten woman per year . Our research project dedicate comprehension mechanism underlie development PE search gold prognostic marker pathology . We particularly interest study new angiogenic factor , EG-VEGF , recently report new factor specific endocrine gland include placenta . In recent result obtain team , show ) placental EG-VEGF show peak expression establishment foeto-maternal circulation ii ) EG-VEGF receptor , PKR1 PKR2 also express first trimester pregnancy iii ) EG-VEGF expression receptor PKR1 up-regulated hypoxia . In last publication `` press JCMM '' show EG-VEGF inhibits EVT migration invasion . More importantly , succeeded measure EG-VEGF circulating level non pregnant pregnant woman three trimester pregnancy show high level ( 5 time non pregnant level ) find first trim pregnancy significant decrease thereafter . Furthermore , cohort 19 PE patient 21 age match control , observe significant increase EG-VEGF level PE group . Therefore hypothesize EG-VEGF could play important role human placentation persistence expression first trim pregnancy may contribute development PE . Based Doppler analysis method assessment uterine artery transformation end 1st trimester , propose search correlation circulate level new angiogenic factor EG-VEGF serum pregnant woman 14 18 WG , development PE and/or IUGR . Doppler ultrasonography predictive method pregnancy outcome time development disease ( 1st 2nd trimester ) , threaten symptom launch ( end 2nd 3rd trimester ) . In normal pregnancy , impedance flow uterine artery decrease gestation result trophoblastic invasion spiral artery conversion low-resistance vessel end first trim pregnancy . Therefore , present study also allow search negative correlation level uterine artery transformation level EG-VEGF . The study conduct collaboration Clinical centre Grenoble CHU Hospital ( Dr JL . Cracowski ) . In study plan include 500 pregnant pregnant woman . Patients recruit time first ultrasonography 11 13 WG include study 14 18 WG . For patient blood sample take measurement circulate EG-VEGF Doppler analysis uterine artery transformation perform . These result provide information concern potential prognostic value seric concentration EG-VEGF PE and/or IUGR allow check whether plasma level EG-VEGF 14-18 week gestation could propose prognostic marker preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
