	<brief_summary>Comparing efficacy safety isolation pulmonary vein ( PV ) use Cryoballoon catheter versus radiofrequency ablation ThermoCool catheter patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FIRE AND ICE : Comparative Study Two Ablation Procedures Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize clinical trial compare efficacy safety isolate PVs either cryoballoon RF ablation technique ThermoCool catheter , system regard standard ablation . In total 762 patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation randomize either radiofrequency ( RF ) cryoballoon . With technique , PV isolation perform . Primary end point trial time first recurrence atrial arrhythmias prescription anti-arrhythmic drug blank period three month . Treatment success evaluate use weekly electrocardiography ( ECG ) monitoring ( transtelephonic transmission/Tele-ECG ) use Holter electrocardiogram .</detailed_description>
