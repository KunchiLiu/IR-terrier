	<brief_summary>Despite substantial therapeutic advance , Post-traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) remain difficult treat . One promise new area research post-reactivation pharmacologic intervention , base upon concept blockade memory reconsolidation . Recent animal research suggest reactivation ( retrieval ) store memory return labile ( alterable ) state must restabilized order persist . This process call `` reconsolidation , '' various drug find block animal . This blockade may lead weaken original memory trace . The aim study pilot effect mifepristone physiologic respond traumatic imagery . Although mifepristone widely safely use cause medical abortion , also powerful stress hormone receptor blocker . These stress hormone , call glucocorticoid , may enhance memory ( ) consolidation . Indeed , recent study animal report mifepristone block reconsolidation context-conditioned fear rat . Reconsolidation blockade two-stage process . First , memory must destabilize recalling . Second , reconsolidation memory must block drug . Memory trace form stressful condition may resist destabilization thus inaccessible reconsolidation blocker . However , reconsolidation blocker pair d-cycloserine ( DCS ) animal train stressful condition , reconsolidation blockade become successful . These result suggest DCS promote destabilization resistant memory trace . The traumatic memory individual PTSD may particularly resistant destabilization . Therefore , study compare mifepristone pair DCS placebo control . The script-driven traumatic imagery method validate previous study propranolol lab use . Briefly , subject PTSD describe traumatic event script preparation session , reactivate memory . They receive ) mifepristone DCS b ) placebo . A week later , engage script-driven mental imagery traumatic event physiologic response ( heart rate , sweating , etc ) measure . This pilot study formal hypothesis . The aim estimate effect size mifepristone compare effect size propranolol lab 's previous work .</brief_summary>

PTSD criterion Subject currently meet DSMIV criterion B.5 , viz. , `` physiological reactivity exposure internal external cue symbolize resemble aspect traumatic event . '' Medical condition contraindicates administration mifepristone , e.g. , history adrenal failure ; concurrent corticosteroid therapy ; hemorrhagic disorder ; cardiovascular , hypertensive , hepatic , respiratory renal disease ; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; severe anemia ; heavy smoking ; porphyria ; allergy mifepristone ; concurrent anticoagulant therapy ; medical condition contraindicates administration DCS e.g. , hypersensitivity cycloserine , epilepsy , severe renal insufficiency . Pregnant ( determined mandatory blood pregnancy test , currently breast feed . ( Note : Women hysterectomy postmenopausal ( define age 50 menstrual period least 12 month ) exempt pregnancy test .
