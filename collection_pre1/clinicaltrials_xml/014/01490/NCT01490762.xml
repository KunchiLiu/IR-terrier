	<detailed_description>Healthy Normal Volunteers randomize sequence 4 different dos Technosphere速 Insulin ( TI ) , inhale use Gen2C device , one dose subcutaneously inject Regular Human Insulin . A euglycemic clamp procedure perform dose visit . The purpose study determine insulin dose proportionality/linearity Technosphere速 Insulin ( TI ) Inhalation Powder base AUCo-180 administration follow dos use Gen2C inhaler : - 10 U ( one 10 U cartridge ) - 30 U ( one 10 U one 20 U cartridge ) - 60 U ( three 20 U cartridge ) - 80 U ( four 20 U cartridge )</detailed_description>
