	<brief_title>The Effect Nitroglycerin Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) Insertion Experience Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing acceptability use long act reversible contraceptive method like intrauterine device ( IUD ) important strategy reduce risk unintended pregnancy . Unfortunately , fear IUD insertion nulliparous woman common among health care provider woman alike , limit IUD use . While many health care provider assume placement difficult nulliparous woman , evidence risk unsuccessful insertion higher . Women worry pain insertion , fear unfounded U.S. international data show nulliparous woman report approximately twice much pain IUD insertion compare parous woman . A key difference nulliparous multiparous woman resistance cervix . While cervical dilation uncommonly need IUD placement , force often required pas insertion device internal o . Although misoprostol ibuprofen study way improve IUD insertion experience , neither prove effective , misoprostol actually show increase pain . Therefore , increase acceptance highly effective contraceptive , need investigate novel , low cost , easily apply accessible technique improve insertion experience . Nitric oxide ( NO ) donor , include nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , isosorbide mononitrate isosorbide dinitrate , effect animal human cervix . Both nitroglycerin isosorbide mononitrate tablet administer vaginally show RCTs induce effective cervical ripen minimal side effect first trim abortion compare placebo . Nitroprusside isosorbide dinitrate gel give intracervically prior first trimester abortion also show minimal side effect several RCTs , mixed result regard effectiveness . Additional safety data NO donor apply topically skin mucosal surface well establish routine use topical nitroglycerin treatment anal fissure . Although recent randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare nitroprusside gel misoprostol cervical ripening prior first trimester surgical abortion find superior cervical dilation misoprostol group , significant difference cervical dilation 5 mm . While study abortion concern provide adequate dilation beyond 8 mm , cervical remodel necessary help IUD insertion much less , levonorgestrel intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) inserter 4.75 mm diameter . Since NO donor smooth muscle relaxant , expect induce cervical ripen without cause uterine cramping , significant side effect misoprostol . Nitroglycerin inexpensive , stable room temperature , readily available tablet ointment form , well dextrose solution intravenous administration . The ointment form commonly apply topically treatment anal fissure . We propose follow aim : 1 . To determine nitroglycerin ointment apply vaginally 30-45 minute prior IUD insertion improve pain among nulliparous woman compare placebo ointment . Self-reported pain score 100 mm VAS assess multiple time point IUD insertion procedure . In addition , overall satisfaction adverse effect evaluate . 2 . To determine nitroglycerin ointment apply vaginally 30-45 minute prior IUD insertion improve ease IUD insertion provider compare placebo ointment . In addition , need additional dilation , additional pain medicine paracervical block , inability place IUD , complication track . 3 . To determine nitroglycerin ointment apply vaginally 30-45 minute prior IUD insertion safe well tolerate . Side effect related treatment nitroglycerin ointment placebo compare . Blood pressure measure multiple time point .</detailed_description>
