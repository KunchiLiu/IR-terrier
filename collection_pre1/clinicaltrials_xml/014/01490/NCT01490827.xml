	<criteria>Adults , age 25 year old severe profound outer retinal degeneration ( include Agerelated Macular Degeneration ) Have residual light perception . If residual light perception remain , retina must able respond electrical stimulation ; Have previous history useful form vision Have consent participate study Had Argus II Retinal Prosthesis surgically implant 14 day ( ± 7 day ) prior enrollment ( Baseline Visit ) study At time Baseline Visit , suffer nonophthalmic serious adverse event ( e.g . coma , myocardial infarction , etc. ) . Ocular disease condition could prevent Argus II work ( e.g . optic nerve disease , central retinal artery vein occlusion , history retinal detachment , trauma , severe strabismus , etc . ) Ocular structure condition could prevent successful implantation Argus II Implant adequate healing surgery ( e.g . extremely thin conjunctiva ; axial length &lt; 20.5 mm &gt; 26 mm ; corneal ulcer ; choroidal neovascularization area intend tack location , etc . ) Ocular disease condition ( cataract ) prevent adequate visualization inner structure eye ( e.g . corneal opacity ) Predisposition eye rub Any disease condition prevents understand communication inform consent , study demand , test protocol , include : cognitive decline include diagnosed form dementia and/or progressive neurologic disease , psychiatric disease include diagnose form depression ; speak principal language associate region , deafness selective frequency hear loss prevents hear device alarm alert Participants pregnant wish become pregnant course study Participation another investigational drug device study may conflict objective , followup test study ; Conditions likely limit life less 1 year time inclusion .</criteria>
