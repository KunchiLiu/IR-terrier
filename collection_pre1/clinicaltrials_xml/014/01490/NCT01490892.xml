	<brief_summary>This non-randomized trial 450 woman breast abnormality , schedule breast biopsy abnormality . The study conduct two clinical site . The primary objective trial : To evaluate quantitative 3D Subharmonic imaging ( SHI ) pulse inversion harmonic imaging ( HI ) improve characterization benign malignant breast mass ( independently combination image mode ) compare x-ray mammography , fundamental grayscale ultrasound ( US ) power Doppler imaging ( PDI ) . The secondary aim trial : To compare quantitative ( bifurcation &amp; vessel length ) semi-quantitative ( blood pool &amp; parametric imaging ) measure vascular morphology breast lesion determine pathology SHI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized trial conduct two clinical site ( Breast Imaging Centers Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) Hospital University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) Hospital ) . All 450 subject receive two IV bolus injection Definity ( Lantheus Medical Imaging , Billerica , MA ) , undergo unenhanced ( baseline ) Definity contrast-enhanced US imaging study evaluation breast mass breast abnormality without mass , schedule undergo clinically indicate biopsy breast lesion investigation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be female diagnose xray mammography ( perform within 90 day prior study procedure ) solid breast mass abnormal area without mass . Be schedule biopsy ( core / excisional / lumpectomy ) mass region abnormality mastectomy within 30 day study procedure . Be least 18 year age . Be medically stable . If female childbearing potential , must negative pregnancy test . Have sign Informed Consent participate study . Males Females pregnant nursing . Patients whose breast lesion unequivocally cyst unenhanced US . Patients currently chemotherapy primary cancer require systemic treatment . Patients medically unstable , patient seriously terminally ill , patient whose clinical course unpredictable . For example : Patients life support critical care unit . Patients unstable occlusive disease ( eg , crescendo angina ) Patients clinically unstable cardiac arrhythmia , recurrent ventricular tachycardia . Patients uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class IV ) Patients recent cerebral hemorrhage . Patients clinically significant unstable renal and/or liver disease ( eg , transplant recipient rejection ) Patients undergone surgery within 24 hour prior study sonographic examination . Patients know hypersensitivity perflutren Patients receive contrast medium ( Xray , MRI , CT , US ) 24 hour prior research US exam Patients cardiac shunt . Patients congenital heart defect . Patients severe emphysema , pulmonary vasculitis , history pulmonary embolus . Patients confirm suspected liver lesion . Patients respiratory distress syndrome . Patients excisional biopsy/lumpectomy current area interest within past 6 week .</criteria>
