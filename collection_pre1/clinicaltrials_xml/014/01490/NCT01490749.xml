	<brief_summary>The purpose study test drug RAD001 combination another chemotherapy drug , Carboplatin , well radiation therapy treatment esophageal cancer . Because RAD001 use combination , clear dose best use combination . The standard care patient esophageal cancer move area body ( non-metastatic ) include combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy possibly surgery . If patient chooses participate study , patient receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . The patient possibly also surgery cancer remove . This decision make treat physician . All chemotherapy patient receive study consider standard chemotherapy esophagus cancer . The investigator know yet drug call RAD001 help improve treatment patient disease . RAD001 pill use many type cancer proven effective cancer kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial XELOX Followed Radiation Combined With Carboplatin RAD001 Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer sixth common cause cancer-related death worldwide . Recent medical advance lead small improvement survival , overall rate survival remain low , make new treatment approach necessary . Chemotherapy drug radiation therapy often use treat esophageal cancer . The combination oxaliplatin capecitabine ( XELOX ) commonly use chemotherapy combination . Sometimes chemotherapy give `` induction '' therapy , radiation give . The drug RAD001 target drug act specifically protein inside cell ( call mTOR ) , important cancer development . The combination RAD001 radiation therapy show improve anti-cancer effect . This study look ideal dose RAD001 give combination radiation therapy induction chemotherapy XELOX , test anticancer effect treatment approach patient esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
