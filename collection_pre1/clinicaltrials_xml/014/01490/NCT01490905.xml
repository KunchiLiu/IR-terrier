	<brief_title>A Double Blind Placebo Study Determine Effectiveness Theramine Management Chronic Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis management back pain challenge primary care physicians specialist . Establishing etiology difficult often problematic , treatment option capable produce serious potentially life threatening side effect . Treatments often exert modest impact natural history condition . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) frequently prescribe treat chronic back pain . NSAIDs moderately effective relieve pain . NSAIDs lead cause drug-induced gastrointestinal bleeds , common cause drug-induced morbidity mortality particularly high dose . They also exacerbate hypertension , edema produce nephrotoxicity . The effect also dose dependent . Recent data indicate NSAIDs risk factor myocardial infarction , particularly high dos . Recent data also indicate NSAIDs disrupt collagen repair injured tissue . Muscle relaxant narcotic analgesic show limited efficacy often produce sedation , constipation inappropriate usage . Physical therapy local modality often satisfy , costly , require considerable investment patient time . Neurotransmitter depletion demonstrate contribute chronic pain state . Increased nutrient requirement associate pain syndrome consequent reduce production neurotransmitter contribute maladaptive pain response . The ability enhance neurotransmitter production associate pain syndrome limited multiple factor , specifically unavailability adequate essential amino acid diet increase turnover rate amino acid need produce neurotransmitter pain syndrome . Other factor prolong pharmaceutical use deplete nerve cell neurotransmitter . Attempts modify brain neurochemistry focus single neurotransmitter serotonin GABA . However , approach fail address complexity complementary influence multiple neurotransmitter patient perception pain suffering . Theramine proprietary prescription Medical Food concurrently enhance several neurotransmitter involve pain modulation sensation provide neurotransmitter precursor form amino acid , ( see attach Monograph detailed discussion ) . Small trial find Theramine effective reduce modify pain without demonstrable side effect . Theramine simultaneously stimulate production neurotransmitter serotonin , GABA , brain induced cortisol , nitric oxide , glutamate .</detailed_description>
