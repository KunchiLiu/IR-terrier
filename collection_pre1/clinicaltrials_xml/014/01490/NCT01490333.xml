	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) diabetes occur commonly among Native Americans ( NA ) , lead cause death among northern US NAs . Moreover , low vitamin D status occur commonly population . An increase amount evidence indicate correlation low vitamin D status CVD diabetes contribute heighten pro-inflammatory environment within endothelial line blood vessel lead atherosclerotic disease , impaired sensitivity insulin lead diabetes . Our fundamental hypothesis low vitamin D status risk factor CVD cause proinflammatory milieu , thereby lead endothelial dysfunction . Additionally , investigator hypothesize vitamin D supplementation reduce inflammation , thereby restore endothelial function ultimately reduce CVD risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low vitamin D status endemic due 21st century lifestyle , limit sun exposure , inadequate dietary intake . An increase body data relate low vitamin D status increase risk non-musculoskeletal morbidity include , notably , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . CVD , T2DM major risk factor , cause one-third death US . Moreover , American Indians ( AI ) Alaskan Natives ( AN ) 20 % likely develop CVD 2.2 time likely develop DM non-Hispanic white . In fact , AI Great Lakes Region ( Bemidji Area ) third high DM rate nation , age-adjusted DM mortality rate almost three-fold high all-race mortality , high rate CVD among AI nationally . In population , CVD DM two top four cause death , preliminary work find low vitamin D status commonplace . As low vitamin D status , CVD T2DM epidemic among AI , investigator hypothesize low vitamin D causally related CVD T2DM establish pro-inflammatory milieu , turn predisposes CVD T2DM . As , vitamin D supplementation reduce marker inflammation thereby ultimately reduce risk CVD T2DM . This work explore possibility evaluate effect vitamin D status endothelial function ( measure arterial reactivity ) , plasma biomarkers inflammation glucose homeostasis 100 postmenopausal AI woman . Subjects receive vitamin D3 , either 400 2,500 IU , daily six month . The investigator define effect vitamin D status , subsequent response supplementation , endothelial function , arterial stiffness ( flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery , carotid femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) ) , plasma marker inflammation glucose homeostasis . All study participant fast laboratory noninvasive vascular ultrasound study perform baseline follow three six month study . Plasma concentration pro-inflammatory cytokine measure secondary outcome variable . Fasting blood glucose , insulin adipocytokines leptin adiponectin , measure exploratory outcomes potential future study .</detailed_description>
