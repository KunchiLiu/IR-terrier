	<detailed_description>Episodic work memory process affect cognitive domain Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) early stage , Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) unique tool interfere cognitive process induce `` virtual transient lesion '' , mimic observe MCI . It proven repeatedly capacity interfere encoding-retrieval memory task . However , date , image data exist cerebral pathway involve encode memory task . Moreover , stability TMS effect time remain investigate . If prove stable interfering challenge , TMS could use investigate potential restore effect new medication AD . The study pilot study large clinical trial aim prove utility rTMS potential model prediction clinical efficacy use combination cognitive neuroimaging endpoint . This pilot study specifically aim : - determine cerebral region stimulate use functional neuronavigation , - evaluate effect rTMS behavioral functional imaging data ( functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging , fMRI ) - investigate stability TMS interfering effect replicate experimental day 4 time . The study compose two part : - Part A : Day 1 , subject perform episodic memory task MRI scanner determine individual main activation . The mean activation peak obtain group analysis use target coordinate part B . Two week later , Day 2 , subject repeat episodic memory task MRI scanner . The BOLD signal change compare Day 1 Day 2 investigate stability activation elicit memory task . - Part B : subject randomly assign Group 1 2 . - GROUP 1 : The subject come 4 different day . On day , subject perform episodic memory task actively stimulate use rTMS L-DLPFC Vertex ( control region ) random order undergo fMRI session Day 1 Day 2 . Later , undergo another set behavioral task CANTAB battery stimulate rTMS use placebo coil . - GROUP 2 : The subject come 4 different day . On day , subject perform episodic memory task actively stimulate use rTMS L-DLPFC Vertex ( control region ) random order undergo fMRI session Day 1 Day 2 . Later , undergo another set behavioral task CANTAB battery stimulate rTMS use active coil . Total expected number subject : 34 subject Parts A B PART A : 10 subject PART B : 24 subject ( 12 per group )</detailed_description>
