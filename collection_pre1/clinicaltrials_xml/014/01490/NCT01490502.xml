However , know give supplemental vitamin D MS reduce risk attack , research suggest vitamin D could even harmful people MS . In clinical trial , patient relapsing-remitting MS receive high-dose low-dose oral vitamin D addition approve therapy MS , glatiramer acetate .

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D insufficiency recently emerge risk factor susceptibility multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Our observational data suggest low vitamin D level patient relapsing-remitting MS associate higher subsequent relapse rate . However , unknown provide vitamin D supplementation patient lead reduction risk exacerbation . Historically , several nutritional supplement appear helpful observational study various disease demonstrate benefit harmful randomize trial . Further , vitamin D response element recently identify promoter region HLA-DRB1*15 , gene believe critical initiating autoimmune response MS , 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increase expression gene vitro , suggest vitamin D supplementation could even harmful establish MS . This randomized , double-blind trial high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 supplementation add-on glatiramer acetate 172 patient relapsing-remitting MS . Subjects randomize 600 IU 5000 IU oral vitamin D3 daily two year . A standardized brain MRI scan perform baseline end first second year . The impact high-dose vitamin D supplementation number relapse , number new lesion brain MRI , change brain volume assess . Establishing association major implication treatment patient MS throughout world provide rationale investigation role vitamin D immunopathogenesis MS , possibly lead identification new therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
