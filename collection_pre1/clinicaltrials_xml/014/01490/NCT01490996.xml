	<brief_summary>Oral curcumin ( complex C3 , Sabinsa Corp , Utah ) give patient inoperable colorectal metastasis commence standard care oxaliplatin-based ( FOLFOX ) chemotherapy 12 cycle ( approximately 6 month ) treatment . Primary measurement focus safety tolerability . These record real-time report number severity adverse event . Secondary measurement include efficacy , ( measure response rate RECIST overall survival month ) support biomarker analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combining Curcumin With FOLFOX Chemotherapy Patients With Inoperable Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Combination oral curcumin FOLFOX-based chemotherapy safe tolerated regimen long-term administration patient colorectal metastasis . Primary objective To establish tolerate dose daily oral curcumin take long-term FOLFOX-based chemotherapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer conduct ass : 1 . Safety , tolerability feasibility administer oral curcumin increase dos escalate 4 capsule ( ≈2 g C3-complex ) FOLFOX-based chemotherapy continue duration chemotherapy course . Secondary objective 1 . To observe change neuropathic side-effects chemotherapy . 2 . To observe potential efficacy term disease response survival . 3 . To identify putative biomarkers plasma . This phase I/IIa study : Phase I traditional escalation response design study ( 3+3+3 ) firstly assess safety combination identify maximum tolerate dose 4 g per day . Phase IIa randomise control study compare curcumin FOLFOX FOLFOX alone , recruit 2:1 ratio respectively .</detailed_description>
