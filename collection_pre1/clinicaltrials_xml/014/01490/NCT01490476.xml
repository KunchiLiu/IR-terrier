	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study RAD001 Growth Vestibular Schwannoma ( ) Neurofibromatosis 2 ( NF2 ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol Phase II , open-label , efficacy safety study single-agent RAD001 patient NF2 . During study , subject receive continuous daily oral treatment RAD001 4 year tumor progression . Primary Objective : To determine whether RAD001 effect VS growth patient NF2 rate sufficient submit drug test . Secondary Objectives : To determine whether RAD001 effect volume intracranial tumor ; assess effect RAD001 hearing function patient NF2 ( applicable ) ; determine whether RAD001 modulate signal pathway intracranial NF2 tumor remove course study . And determine long term safety . All patient treat RAD001 10 mg p.o . daily dose ( 5mg 15-17 year old cutaneous surface area &lt; 1.5m2 ) one year except case unacceptable toxicity , death , discontinuation study reason . At 12 month extension another one year RAD001 treatment discuss case response . If patient stable ( decrease increase lower 20 % ) , treatment stop patient keep quarterly continuous surveillance . Resumption treatment discuss case case basis tumor regrowth 20 % relative tumor volume end treatment . All patient follow-up visit ( include MRI ) schedule 24 month enrollment . We modify protocol extend treatment RAD001 period two additional year stable patient still treatment two year enrollment .</detailed_description>
