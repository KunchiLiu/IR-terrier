	<brief_summary>Objectives This observational study aim update overall survival ( OS ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) accelerated-blastic ( AB ) phase complete cytogenetic response ( CCgR ) duration CML patient 1986 2001 treat IFN base therapy ( either alone combination ) obtain CCgR . It also aim analyse clinical biological feature select cohort patient persist CCgR treatment IFN . Study design This study observational retrospective multicenter study . Assessment Follow-up Patients ' demographic data retrospective collection CML cytogenetic molecular data report `` Assessment Follow-up FORM '' . In FORM event related therapy , disease survival also report . Duration study : The recruitment period estimate approximately 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study rational - IFN , either alone combination AC , prolong survival Ph+ CML patient , early chronic phase , mainly patient achieve CCgR - CCgR become surrogate marker survival duration main target IFN therapy - CCgR rare event account less 10 % cytogenetic responsive patient - These case consider fascinating elite patient high sensitivity IFN likely candidate prolong survival possibly cure - From 1986 2001 , 1200 CML patient either enrolled different national trial refer single Institutions treat frontline IFN base therapy - In 2001 , data 317 CCgRs report EICML group - They include 214 case treat IFN alone collect database 9 national study group Austria , Belgium , Netherlands , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , Sweden United Kingdom 103 case treat IFN alone collect single Institutions Italy , France , United Kingdom . - The study include patient achieve CCgR IFN + LDAC - The contribution Italy 119 case : 59 national study 60 single Institutions - The follow-up patient stop 2000 2000 thereafter almost CML patient treat IM - We n't know patient achieve CCgR IFN base therapy continue discontinue IFN , cross IM therapy - We n't know maintain CCgR without therapy - We n't know patient achieve CCgR IFN cross IM cytogenetic molecular response , PFS OS majority patient unresponsive IFN treat IM - We n't know clinical biological feature select cohort patient</detailed_description>
