	<brief_summary>The purpose study find rBet v1-FV work relieve Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis symptom compare Placebo ( inactive substance look like rBet v1-FV also contain Aluminum Hydroxide contain experimental drug ) . rBet v1-FV vaccine work expose immune system something resemble birch . This vaccine may help lessen allergy symptom natural birch season .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Range Finding Study With rBet v1-FV - Adult Patients With Birch Pollen-Allergic Seasonal Rhinoconjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type I allergy immune-disorder stem formation IgE antibodies proteins glycoprotein plant , insect , animal fungi , normally consider harmless . The cross-linking specific IgE antibody effector cell allergens activates immunological cascade lead symptom Type I allergy include rhinitis , conjunctivitis , asthma , anaphylactic shock . Allergic Rhinitis common chronic atopic disease associate considerable cost co-morbidity . Seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) , trigger pollen tree , grass weed , characterize sneezing , nasal congestion , nasal itching , rhinorrhea , pruritic , watery , red eye . Recombinant preparation offer various advantage base natural allergen extract . Recombinant protein produce highly purified form pharmaceutical quality ; proteins molecularly define thus ensure product consistency minimise problem related allergen extract standardisation ; preparation include protein consider relevant specific immunotherapy ; risk contamination allergenic material exclude ; whole production process design exclude risk factor introduction infectious agent ; relative dosage individual component final preparation optimise favour well clinical efficacy . Allergy vaccination ( AV ) mediate immune response allergen exposure alter TH2 response favour TH1 T-cell response , increase IgG production decrease production inflammatory cytokine . rBet v1-FV AV design enhance beneficial immune response . The investigational product demonstrate efficacy good tolerability one previous pivotal Phase III two previous Phase II study .</detailed_description>

Concurrent participation clinical trial participation clinical trial previous 30 day . Treatment betablockers ( locally systemically ) . Contraindication adrenalin ( e.g . acute chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease , severe hypertension ) . Immunotherapy criterion : Previous specific immunotherapy birch early blossoming tree ( e.g . Alder , Hazel ) formulation within past 5 year . Any current immunotherapy . Any previous specific immunotherapy unknown mixed allergen . Other allergy : Clinically relevant perennial allergy . Diseases health status : Clinically relevant rhinoconjunctival respiratory symptom related reason . Has diagnose asthma . Has PEF FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal Any acute chronic disease , opinion investigator , would affect study objective subject safety ( e.g. , Diabetes mellitus type I , malignant neoplasia , chronic renal failure , inflammatory disease liver kidney , emphysema , bronchiectasis ) . Autoimmune diseases , immunedefects include immunesuppression , immunecomplexinduced immunopathies ( e.g . HIV , posttransplant patient , lupus erythematodes [ SLE ] , Grave 's disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ) time screen . Has history clinically significant disease might impact efficacy analysis .</criteria>
