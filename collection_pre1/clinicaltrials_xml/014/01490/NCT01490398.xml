	<detailed_description>In hypertensive patient high risk , lipid lower statin provide additional beneficial effect hypertensive patient average level serum total cholesterol . However , underlie mechanism statin improve clinical outcome hypertension unclear . In patient hypercholesterolemia coronary atherosclerosis , several study report level LDL-cholesterol inversely correlate coronary blood flow reserve suggest statin improve coronary blood flow . Although speculated statin may improve coronary blood flow decrease LDL cholesterol level stabilize atherosclerotic plaque coronary atherosclerosis , effect statin coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) examine hypertensive patient . LDL cholesterol expect significantly decrease rosuvastatin 20mg administer . In addition LDL-cholesterol lowering effect , stabilization atherosclerotic plaque regression atheroma observe rosuvastatin treatment . Because beneficial effect rosuvastatin , may expect rosuvastatin improve coronary blood flow even hypertensive patient without hypercholesterolemia efficacy rosuvastatin CFR need investigated hypertensive patient cardiovascular risk . Morphologic assessment measurement coronary lumen invasive coronary angiography use gold standard ass stenosis coronary disease . However , decrease myocardial blood flow due coronary artery disease could exactly evaluate morphologic stenosis , functional test require assess significance coronary artery stenosis , CFR could directly measure use Doppler guide wire since mid-1990s . Since pathophysiological implication coronary stenosis assess use CFR measurement , CFR value widely use clinical practice useful indicator ass coronary stenosis severity perform percutaneous coronary intervention . As high frequency transducer excellent resolution use , coronary artery directly image , coronary flow velocity measure use echo-Doppler technique . As result , CFR easily measure echocardiography lab could measure cardiac catheterization lab use Doppler guide wire past . It confirm CFR value obtain Doppler technique invasively obtain cardiac catheterization lab . The clinical usefulness accuracy technique verify also diagnosis coronary artery disease . Therefore , clinically important timely project measure CFR non-invasively use echocardiography elucidate mechanism clinical benefit statin hypertensive patient cardiovascular risk . We try evaluate effect rosuvastatin CFR measure change CFR 1 year treatment rosuvastatin , correlate CFR LDL-cholesterol CRP .</detailed_description>
