	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn difference patient ' quality recovery receive 1 2 standard kind pain control treatment surgery liver and/or pancreas . Researchers want learn method help people recover completely quickly surgery . The 2 kind pain control intravenous ( IV ) pain management epidural pain management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Thoracic Epidural Analgesia Versus Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia For Liver and/or Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If agree take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . For every participant assign Group 1 , 3 participant assign Group 2 . This mean 3 time likely assign Group 2 Group 1 . - Group 1 receive IV pain management . - Group 2 receive epidural pain management . Group 1 : IV pain management give needle arm . This needle place either hold area operating room . You needle place matter take part study . The needle use give drug manage fluid surgery . After surgery , doctor set limit high dose pain medication receive time , able use hand-held button adjust drug accord level pain may . If pain well control , study staff may decide switch Group 2 seem best interest . Group 2 : Epidural pain management give needle inserted space cover spinal cord cord . This area full fluid call epidural region . The needle place surgery , either hold area operate room doctor give anesthesia . If epidural work , study staff may decide switch Group 1 seem best interest . Both Groups : During surgery , catheter ( sterile flexible tube ) place artery . This catheter use provide additional fluid blood support monitor surgery . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . During surgery , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn receive anesthesia . This blood drawn use one IV line already place surgery . This blood test look certain protein call cytokine may help researcher understand body respond pain pain affect heal process . You ask sign separate consent form describe surgery risk detail . The study staff also tell standard pain medication , give , possible risk . After Surgery : After surgery , go Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) recovery . You physical exam check recovery . Your vital sign also measure . You ask feel . Your doctor ( ) decide whether go PACU intensive care unit ( ICU ) , overnight recovery suite , move regular post-surgical recovery floor room , recovery watch . On Days 1 , 3 , 5 surgery , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn cytokine test . This blood drawn along routine blood work surgery . If Group 2 , member MD Anderson Pain Service check epidural site every day make sure work problem area around epidural . A nurse also check shift ( every 8-10 hour ) see well able move epidural affect feel area suppose work . In group , ask rate level pain management scale 0-10 . When first come surgery , pain rating happen every hour . Your pain also rat every hour assign surgical ICU . When get room ( overnight recovery surgical floor ) , happen every 4 hour . You use call bell let nurse know pain intolerable nurse check . Questionnaires : Before surgery , fill questionnaire pain quality life . This take 20 minute complete . From day surgery ( Day 1 ) Day 5 , also ask fill questionnaire recovery side effect symptom may pain medication . This take 20-40 minute . While hospital , ask answer question measure quickly recover sedation use surgery . Each shift ( every 8-10 hour ) , nurse ask question find quickly recover anesthesia . Length Study Participation : The pain medication epidural insertion stop early intolerable side effect medication work . Your participation study Day 5 . This investigational study . IV pain management epidural pain management FDA approve commercially available . Randomly assign type pain management comparing treatment do research purpose . Up 200 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients undergo liver and/or pancreatic surgical resection malignancy MD Anderson Cancer Center . 2 . Patients 18 year age old . There upper age restriction . 3 . Patients must sign studyspecific consent form . 4 . Adequate coagulation function within 30 day surgery : Platelets &gt; /= 100,000/ml ; INR &lt; /= 1.5 ; aPTT &lt; /= 40 . 5 . Patients must fever evidence infection coexist medical condition would preclude epidural placement . 1 . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease comorbidity preclude liver pancreatic surgery . 2 . History chronic pain , longterm narcotic use consider chronic pain consultation postoperatively . 3 . Anaphylaxis local anesthetic narcotic . 4 . Previous current neurologic disease affect low hemithorax . 5 . Major open abdominal/thoracic surgery previous 30 day general anesthesia , except TIVA ( total intravenous anesthesia ) . 6 . Technical contraindication epidural placement : previous thoracic spinal surgery local skin soft tissue infection propose site epidural insertion . 7 . Ongoing use plan perioperative use anticoagulant ( include DVT prophylaxis ) . 8 . Known bleed diathesis coagulopathy . 9 . Educational , psychiatric ( untreated poorly control schizophrenia , major depression , bipolar disorder ) , communication ( language ) barrier would preclude accurate assessment postoperative pain and/or ability answer questionnaire ( need able read , comprehend , answer question ) . 10 . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . 11 . Patient refusal participate randomization . 12 . Pregnant woman exclude study ; woman childbearing potential ( define undergone hysterectomy postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ) must agree practice adequate contraception refrain breastfeeding , specify informed consent . 13 . Patients obvious unresectable disease prior sign inform consent .</criteria>
