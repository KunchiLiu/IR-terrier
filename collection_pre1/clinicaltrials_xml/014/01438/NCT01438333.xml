	<brief_title>Efficacy INERSAN Patients With Chronic Periodontitis Adjunctive Full Mouth Disinfection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct double blind , randomize , parallel group , placebo control clinical trial , involve subject 21 year age old evaluate beneficial effect INERSAN® tablet primary treatment patient chronic periodontitis . Patients satisfy `` Inclusion criterion '' enrol study explain objective study take write consent . The probiotic tablet use present study contain single strain Lactobacilli , Lactobacillus brevis CD2 , active component . The placebo mix sugar salt use excipients active formulation . The active study medication Placebo identical appearance organoleptic property . Study treatment start day enrollment continue 6 week . The daily dose trial product 5 tablet per day , one tablet take every 2-3 hour . The tablet keep mouth dissolve . A hot beverage ( e.g . : tea , coffee , milk etc . ) take least half hour medication since elevate temperature could inactivate bacteria . The study drug placebo provide per randomization schedule , pack patient specific pack , bear patient number . The study double mask study , patient Investigator blind entire course trial . A sealed copy randomization code give Principal Investigator direct open break code event adverse event discussion sponsor monitor . Patients inform may withdraw study time reason . The Investigator also right withdraw patient study best interest patient . The reason date discontinuation clearly document case report form patient discontinue study product prematurely . Periodontal examination periodontal probe depth ( PPD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , bleed probe index ( BOP ) , plaque index ( PI ) , tooth mobility , conduct screening period schedule study visit . Photographs dental cavity take start end study treatment . Radiographs compare begin end study compare bone level record relevant finding . At baseline volunteer receive Full Mouth Disinfection ( FMD ) , ensure deposit remove , disclose episode carry remain plaque remove . Saliva sample ( least 3 mL ) collect eppendorf tube immediately frozen -20°C . The activity Arginine deiminase evaluate High Performance Liquid Chromatography fluorescence derivatized aminoacids , monitor formation citrulline Arginine . For metabonomic analysis saliva sample collect morning sterile tube contain sodium fluoride antimicrobic agent . Patients must refrain eating , drinking , smoke dental washing collection . The sample keep ice store -80°C soon possible . Plaque sample collect sterile curette disperse sterilize saline solution store -20°C . Microbiota analyze DNA extract sample use Qiagen kit . L.brevis CD2 strain detect use TaqMan Real Time PCR , use specifically design primer . Microbial flora potentially involved periodontitis , identify quantify molecular biology technique . Breath sample collect 1 mL disposable syringe ( latex-free ) immediately analyze portable gas chromatograph device ( Oral Chroma , Abimedical corporation , Osaka , Japan ) . Blood sample ( 20-25mL ) collect 20 % population study al baseline end treatment period ( 6 week ) .</detailed_description>
