	<brief_title>Effect Joint Mobilization Treatment Chronic Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel rehabilitation method , specifically target decreased muscle activation due joint pathology prior strength training , elicit great improvement muscle function self-reported disability compare traditional therapy . Preliminary evidence suggest ankle joint mobilization improve contribution spinal influence ankle muscle activation individual ankle joint pathology , considerable gap understand cortical contribution muscle activation follow joint injury . It unknown joint mobilization concurrently affect cortical spinal neural motor pathway , well clinical measure patient function . The overall aim grant determine immediate effect talocrural joint mobilization cortical spinal muscle activation fibularis longus ( peroneus ) soleus muscle individual chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) . The secondary aim study examine change ankle dorsiflexion range motion ( ROM ) dynamic balance . This innovate approach provide necessary scientific knowledge regard potential mechanism efficacy joint mobilization .</detailed_description>
