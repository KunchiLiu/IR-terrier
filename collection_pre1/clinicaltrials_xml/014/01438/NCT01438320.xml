	<brief_title>Q-Trial Patients With Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C ( HCV ) serious chronic condition United States affect million people cause rate hepatocellular carcinoma recently double US . Treatment hepatitis C proven effective secondary prevention liver cancer . Current standard antiviral treatment exclude 70-80 % hepatitis C patient therapy due intolerable side effect . Our laboratory effort identify potential novel approach hepatitis C treatment hepatocellular carcinoma prevention Quercetin , heat shock protein inhibitor . This Phase I study evaluate safety tolerability Quercetin hepatitis C patient contraindication standard antiviral treatment ( treatment naïve patient decline standard therapy , patient previously standard treatment relapse , well intolerable side effect previously ) . The investigator recently demonstrate flavonoid Quercetin inhibits hepatitis C viral production tissue culture , least partially inhibition heat shock protein expression . This represent novel mechanism treat hepatitis C infection . Quercetin also low toxicity . These promise characteristic motivate propose Phase I study . Patients recruit UCLA Pfleger Liver Institute treat outpatient basis . Toxicity closely monitor report . Viral load response evaluate secondary endpoint . The anticipated total number patient enrol trial 20 . All patient follow 8 month take first dose study medication . Patients exhibit viral load response extend follow-up , range total follow-up 12-24 month , determine persistence response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participant detectable HCV RNA serum ; stable viral load within previous year ( fluctuation &gt; 2 log scale ) . All participant either treatmentnaïve unwilling treated standard HCV therapy , able tolerate hepatitis C antiviral due side effect complete treatment 6 month prior enrollment trial . Age range 1865 year old ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) Life expectancy great 12 month Participants must : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm ( 3 ) hemoglobin &gt; 13 &gt; 12 g/dL men/women platelet &gt; 125,000 K/mm ( 3 ) total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 g/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 10 X institutional upper limit normal Albumin &gt; 3.4g/dL INR &lt; 1.2 Alpha Fetoprotein &lt; 50 ng/mL creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . All participant must exhibit ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants currently interferon +/ ribavirin antiviral therapy exclude study . Participants previously treat hepatitis C antiviral therapy must recover adverse event due agent ( ) administer . In addition , last antiviral therapy must six month prior enrollment study Participants may receive investigational agent Participants decompensated liver disease cirrhosis exclude trial History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Quercetin bioflavonoid agent According monogram publish Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database , drug interaction Quercetin report occur quinolone antibiotic inhibition pglycoprotein various cytochrome P450 enzymes include CYP3A4/ CYP2C8/ CYP2C9/ CYP2D6 . Quercetin interaction drug categorize ( 1 ) moderate interaction avoid base healthy volunteer study ( 2 ) moderate interaction monitor closely base vitro study demonstrate potential theoretical reduce elimination increase effect . Screening perform prior treatment . Participants concurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , untreated/active cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness , active moderate alcohol use , social situation would limit compliance study protocol exclude study . In addition , participant know hepatitis etiology ( hepatitis B coinfection , hemochromatosis , alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , Wilson Disease , autoimmune hepatitis , alcohol , drug , obesity induce liver disease ) ; hepatocellular carcinoma exclude study . Pregnant woman exclude study . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive subject exclude study . In addition renal hepatic laboratory requirement list , renal liver transplant recipient exclude study .</criteria>
