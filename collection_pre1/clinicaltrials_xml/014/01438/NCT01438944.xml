	<brief_title>Evaluation Transdermal Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) Activity Through Metabolic Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show prolonged exposure nicotine reinforces addiction . The act smoke delivers nicotine lung blood stream . As result , smoke nicotine level peak smoke stop level progressively diminish base ( trough ) level . At peak level smoker feel reward , trough level smoker start experience negative withdrawal affect desire smoke . Nicotine Gum Inhalers mimic smoke behaviour maintain peak trough regime , nicotine patch . Instead , nicotine patch deliver constant base dose consider either smoker trough level level negative withdrawal effect reduce . The question arise nicotine level deliver patch constant potentially baseline smoker level , reinforce addiction therefore contribute high long term relapse rate ? To answer question investigator look metabolite body use breakdown nicotine several enzyme . These metabolite respond level nicotine blood stream increase decreasing time . By test blood flow , blood urine investigator able gain insight body deal constant stable dose nicotine rather peak trough dose . In combination questionnaire investigator able determine level affect .</detailed_description>
