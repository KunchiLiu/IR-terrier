	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : To assess quality recovery patient follow early discharge ( 18 hr ) pedicled TRAM flap breast reconstruction . Quality recovery assess use 27-item validated questionnaire , QoR-27 discharge , Post Operative Days ( POD ) 2 , 4 7 . In addition 100 mm Visual Analog Score ( VAS ) Pain complete discharge recovery room , discharge hospital POD 2 , 4 7 . Clinical Relevance : Postoperative recovery complex process relate various outcome physiological endpoint , incidence adverse event change psychological status . Previous study recovery surgery anesthesia focus primarily physiological endpoint incidence adverse event . Much work occur specialty deal chronic disease state cancer , rheumatology musculoskeletal disorder . There clearly need focus recovery outcome measure ambulatory population postoperative recovery . Here investigator propose measure postoperative recovery outcomes within first week follow TRAM flap reconstructive procedure use validated postoperative quality recovery instrument ( QoR-27 ) 100 mm VAS pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women 's College Hospital first independent ambulatory care hospital Ontario , hospital Ontario primary focus woman 's health . Patients undergo breast reconstruction follow breast cancer institution undergo expedite discharge 18 hr postoperatively . To facilitate next day discharge , multidisciplinary group form determine best evidence perioperative care ensure patient safety excellent postoperative recovery . Minimizing length stay obvious cost saving hospital , patient advantage include minimize exposure hospital-acquired infection earlier return familiar home environment . The need balance advantage early discharge patient complication , however , must address . As hospital across country face length stay constraint experience , study provide important data quality recovery patient undergo early discharge follow breast reconstructive surgery .</detailed_description>
