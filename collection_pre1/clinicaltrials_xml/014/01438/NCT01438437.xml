	<brief_title>Trial Ablation Small Hepatocellular Carcinomas Patients Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting The study would conduct All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi , tertiary care teach hospital , department Gastroenetrology Radiodiagnosis . Sample size Taking RFA standard procedure estimate success rate 95 % , sample size minimum 27 arm require detect equivalence difference 10 % , assume PAI success rate 85 % . This sample size expect provide power 80 % . Randomization - Stratified randomization Child A B do . - Randomization A ( Acetic acid ) B ( Radiofrequency ablation ) do . Diagnostic criterion - Cirrhosis liver- Diagnosis found basis clinical , biochemical , image endoscopy finding . Hepatocellular carcinoma- one follow present 1 . Two image modality ( dual phase CT ( DPCT ) / contrast enhance Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) ) show arterialization hepatic mass 2 . AFP 400ng/ml along arterialisation one imaging modality ( DPCT/ contrast enhance MRI ) 3 . Fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) Definitions 1 . Local recurrence : When Triple phase CT shows- - An area nodular enhancement abuts surround ablation defect protrudes low attenuate necrotic tissue ( may sometimes see arterial phase CT ) - Recurrent soft tissue cause distortion otherwise smooth interphase adjoin liver parenchyma . 2 . Fresh lesion- When new lesion see liver site primary site treat lesion normal liver parenchyma intervene consider fresh lesion . 3 . Residual disease incomplete ablation When follow Triple phase CT shows- - Residual nodular enhancement abuts surround low attenuate ablation defect protrudes low attenuate necrotic tissue ( may sometimes see arterial phase CT ) - Residual soft tissue cause distortion otherwise smooth interphase adjoin liver parenchyma . - Concenteric hyperemia around low attenuate defect show area focal nodularity asymmetric thickness . 4 . End point ablation When Triple phase CT shows- - A homogenous , well define , uniformly low attenuate defect large pretreatment size . - No residual soft tissue see within periphery low attenuate defect - Concentric hyperemia around low attenuate defect uniform thickness focal nodularity . Follow 1 . Clinical follow - All patient would follow Liver clinic monthly unless clinical condition warrant earlier follow - Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also do visit Alfafetoprotein ( AFP ) every six month - Patient tolerance , child 's status would estimate . 2 . Imaging follow - At one month , dual phase CT would do ascertain local response therapy need repeat procedure . After achieve end point ablation ( PAI RFA , DPCT would do 3 6 monthly interval . Duration follow - Since 80 % recurrence occur 2 year therefore duration follow would 2 year ablation .</detailed_description>
