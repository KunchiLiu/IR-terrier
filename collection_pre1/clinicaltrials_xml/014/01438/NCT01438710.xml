	<brief_title>Switching Study Kidney Transplant Patients With Tremor LCP-Tacro ( STRATO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2 sequence , open-label , multicenter , prospective Phase 3b clinical study access drug-induced hand tremor stable kidney transplant subject convert Prograf ( tacro-limus , Astellas Pharma US , Inc. , Deerfield , IL ) generic tacrolimus twice daily ( b.i.d . ) LCP-Tacro tablet ( tacrolimus , Veloxis Pharmaceuticals A/S , Horsholm , Denmark ) daily ( q.d. ) . The trial design determine test drug LCP-Tacro , associate few and/or less severe drug-induced hand tremor observe Prograf generic tacrolimus treatment ; therapy concomitantly administer mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , mycophenolate sodium ( MPS ) , include generic version , and/or prednisone equivalent long dos remain stable study . All prophylaxis medication allow per standard care ( SOC ) participate site ; medication interact pharmacokinetics ( PK ) tacrolimus allow unless subject recipients renal transplant least 1 month 5 year prior enrollment . Following screening , study visit conduct 2-week treatment period consist 1 week Prograf generic tacrolimus SOC , 1 week LCP-Tacro .
