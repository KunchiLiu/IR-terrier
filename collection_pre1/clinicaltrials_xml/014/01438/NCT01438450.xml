	<brief_summary>Background Hepatocellular carcinoma , malignant tumour liver one common cancer worldwide . All India Institute Of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) tertiary care hospital receives two three case Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) day investigator Gastroenterology patient department . Most patient present late disease already advance curative therapy offer . At stage , palliative therapy form mainstay treatment . This include transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) Oral chemotherapy . Many patient also involvement branch portal vein , limit therapeutic option . According Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stag liver cancer , involvement portal vein preclude standard form therapy . These patient recommend experimental therapy . Various form chemotherapy try group patient . HCC vascular tumour thalidomide anti-angiogenic drug inhibits vascularity use treatment HCC . Capecitabine novel drug , give continuous delivery 5-FU used patient HCC find safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Chemotherapy Versus Supportive Therapy In The Treatment Of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim The aim study compare effect Oral chemotherapeutic drug ( Thalidomide Capecitabine ) comparison supportive therapy treatment advance Hepatocellular carcinoma randomize control trial . Setting The study would conduct All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi , tertiary care teach hospital , department Gastroenterology Radiodiagnosis . Diagnostic criterion - Cirrhosis liver- Diagnosis found basis clinical , biochemical , image endoscopy finding . - Hepatocellular carcinoma- one follow present 1 . Two image modality ( dual phase CT ( DPCT ) / contrast enhanced MRI ) show arterialization hepatic mass 2 . AFP 400ng/ml along arterialisation one imaging modality ( DPCT/ contrast enhance MRI ) 3 . Fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) Definitions Advanced HCC- ( BCLC D ) Liver mass ( solitary multiple ) vascular involvement follow - extrahepatic disease - distant metastasis - PST score &gt; 2 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLS ) stag base BCLC classification ( Llovet JM et al . Lancet 2003 ) . Liver cancer stag BCLC A- D accord classification . Tumor response : Based DP contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CECT ) do every 1 , 3 , 6 month start oral chemotherapy response grade following- Complete response ( CR ) : Tumor resolve completely Partial response ( PR ) : Tumor size decrease &gt; 50 % ( product 2 large diameter ) Minor response ( MR ) : Tumor size decrease 25 - 50 % Stable disease ( SD ) : Tumor size + 25 % No response ( NR ) : No change Disease progression Fresh lesion recurrence Patient tolerance Grade 1 : side effect Grade 2 : moderate side effect Grade 3 : severe side effect Grade 4 : life threaten side effect Performance status ( PST score ) PST score 0-4 would assess follow basis 0- No cancer relate symptom . Normal life style 1 . Minor symptom related cancer . Capable non-strenuous activity.Fully ambulatory capable self-care unable carry work activity . Confined bed less 50 % waking hour 2 . Capable limited self-care . Confined bed 50 % waking hour . 3 . Completely disabled . Can carry self-care . Totally confined bed . 4 . Dead Sample Size Earlier study show 1-year response rate 10 % doxorubicin 25 % response rate thalidomide . Combining two drug , 25 % response rate take oral chemotherapy group , 37 patient need group . ( Total 74 pt ) Randomization - Patients randomize confirmation diagnosis obtain write consent - Sequences generate Statistician - Randomization do draw consecutively number opaque seal envelope Follow Clinical follow - All patient would follow Liver clinic monthly unless clinical condition warrant earlier follow - Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also do visit Alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) ( elevate earlier ) every six month - Patient tolerance , child 's status would estimate . - Side effect drug would note . Imaging follow - At one month , dual phase CT would do ascertain response therapy need repeat procedure . Subsequently , DPCT would do 3 6 monthly interval arm receive oral chemotherapy . Duration follow up- one year start chemotherapy</detailed_description>
