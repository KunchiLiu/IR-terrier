	<brief_title>IV Iron Sucrose vs Oral FeSO4 Treating IDA Pediatric IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) common among child inflammatory bowel disease . Causes population multi-factorial , include decrease absorption due intestinal disease , increased loss due bleed gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , poor nutrition . IDA cause significant impaired physical activity associate developmental cognitive abnormality child adolescent . Oral ferrous sulfate traditionally use treat iron deficiency anemia , associate limitation . Studies show part oral iron absorb non-absorbed iron salt toxic intestinal mucosa , also theorize capable activate Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . Use intravenous iron sucrose use population iron deficiency anemia chronic kidney disease child significant blood loss spinal surgery . The aim study determine safety efficacy intravenous iron sucrose improve iron deficiency anemia child inflammatory bowel disease ( comparison oral ferrous sulfate ) .</detailed_description>
