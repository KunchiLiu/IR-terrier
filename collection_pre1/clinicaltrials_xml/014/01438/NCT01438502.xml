	<brief_title>`` The Effect Reduced Fluid Load After Cardiac Surgery ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid overload oedema formation regular find follow on-pump cardiac surgery may contribute postoperative organ dysfunction . Myocardial oedema report impair systolic diastolic function . An association intraoperative fluid load postoperative adverse outcome demonstrate cardiac patient . Our group experience use hypertonic saline/colloids several experimental study ( pig ) . In animal study use hypertonic saline/colloids infusion CPB additive CPB-prime . Both administration method result significant reduction fluid load due good intravascular volume preservation . One clinical study group observe reduce fluid load improve cardiac index infusion hypertonic saline/colloids use cardiac surgery . Patients include study normal leave ventricular function co-morbidity . The plan study include patient combination procedure , aorta coronary bypass valve implantation , expect long CPB-time.Time spent CPB individual risk factor negatively associate increased mortality morbidity . The investigator believe high-risk patient even benefit reduced fluid loading . Their tolerance hypovolemia low incidence hemodynamic instability first hour postoperatively great . The patient randomize receive either continuous infusion hypertonic saline/colloids acetated Ringer ` solution CPB . Accurate account fluid addition , blood loss diuresis keep . Determination cardiac output ( C.O . ) , intrathoracic blood volume ( ITBV ) , extravascular lung water ( EVLW ) global end diastolic volume ( GEDV ) monitor use transpulmonary thermodilution technique PiCCOÂ®plus system . Preoperative postoperative echo cor perform .</detailed_description>
