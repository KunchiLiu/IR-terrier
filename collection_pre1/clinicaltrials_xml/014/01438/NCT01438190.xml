	<brief_summary>Because many woman Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) sensitive use gonadotropin , several strategy propose reduce risk Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) multiple pregnancy . The low dose step-up protocol step-down protocol PCOS patient describe literature . The step-down regimen design achieve follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) threshold load dose FSH subsequent stepwise reduction soon follicular development observe ultrasound . On contrary step-up regimen base upon principle stepwise increase FSH supply determine FSH threshold follicular development . After commencement gonadotropin administration , follicle development observe ultrasound 1 week , increase dose recommend . Once follicle growth observe , FSH dose maintain follicular selection achieve . Preliminary study report step-up step-down regimen achieve similar high rate monofollicular development . However , large study publish far show step-up regimen safer term monofollicular development . Recent data demonstrate metformin administration infertile PCOS patient high-risk OHSS reduces incidence severity OHSS gonadotropin ovarian stimulation step-down regimen vitro fertilization ( IVF ) program . The aim present study compare conventional low dose step-up protocol combine protocol consist metformin gonadotropin step-down regimen .</brief_summary>
