	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn safety usefulness procedure call endoscopic submucosal myotomy , new technique treatment achalasia . Achalasia disorder involve lack smooth muscle relaxation sustain high pressure sphincter ( muscle ) low esophagus . This may result symptom difficulty swallowing , chest pain , regurgitation food eventually , weight loss . For decade , laparoscopic surgical procedure know Heller myotomy primary treatment achalasia patient low surgical risk . In Heller myotomy , surgeon make three four small abdominal incision , insert tube-like instrument , inside , junction esophagus stomach find , lengthwise incision make muscular ring surround low esophageal sphincter weaken muscle lower esophageal sphincter muscle ( LES ) able open easily . However , emerge field know natural orifice ( open ) transluminal ( lumen ) endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) . This approach involve pass endoscope - thin tube built-in camera , light minuscule tool natural opening body , like mouth order perform less invasive surgery without external wound scar . The procedure do use Submucosal Endoscopy Mucosal Flap ( SEMF ) technique involve pass endoscope mouth esophagus , small incision make line esophagus , know mucosa . A balloon insert dilate submucosa - layer inner line esophagus outer wall consist muscle esophagus . Dilation balloon submucosa create tunnel allow insertion endoscope access muscle low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) . A long incision carefully make posterior portion muscular ring form LES . The incision divide muscle fiber LES , weaken muscle , allow easy passage food preserve valve function prevent reflux acid stomach esophagus . The expected duration participation 10 year time study participant undergo endoscopic surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
