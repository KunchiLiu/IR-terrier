	<brief_summary>Small amount sweet taste sugar water reduces pain baby painful blood test injection . The investigator know sugar also reduce pain baby already receive continuous infusion opioid analgesic . This project help determine small amount sugar water reduce pain baby already receive continuous infusion opioid analgesic heel lance procedure nasogastric/orogastric ( NG/OG ) tube insertion . The investigator hypothesize infant receive opioid analgesic low pain score blood test ( heel lance ) NG/OG tube insertion , sucrose give , compare water give .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Sick infant nursed Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) expose large number repeat painful procedure hospitalization [ 1-6 ] . Effectively reduce pain frequently perform repeat painful procedure minimize short term behavioural physiological response pain , potential reduce long term adverse effect , include altered response subsequent pain [ 7 ] increase risk adverse neurodevelopmental , behavioural , cognitive outcome [ 8 ] The effectiveness sucrose sweet solution reduction pain painful procedure infant well establish . Despite large number randomize control trial ( RCTs ) sweet solution procedural pain reduction infant , remain significant knowledge research gap . One key unanswered question whether sweet solution reduce pain give concomitant opioid analgesic [ 9 ] . Rationale : Sick infant hospital need blood test part medical care . Oral sucrose glucose show effectively reduce behavioural response pain pain score commonly perform painful procedure preterm term newborn infant infant 12 month age . However , investigator know also work infant already receive continuous infusion opioid analgesic . The aim establish preliminary evidence effectiveness oral sucrose reduce pain heel lance NG/OG tube insertion concomitant opioid analgesic administer , use pilot data inform full scale RCT . Hypothesis : Infants receive opioid analgesic low pain score blood test ( heel lance ) NG/OG tube insertion , sucrose give , compare water give . Primary Objective : To obtain preliminary data effectiveness sucrose concomitant opioid analgesic compare opioid analgesic alone painful procedure heel lance NG/OG tube insertion inform full scale RCT . Secondary Objectives : To determine acceptability intervention infant ' parent use result help u calculate sample size subsequent full trial . Methods : A single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo control pilot trial conduct urban tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital NICU . The study population infant inpatient Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) receive continuous infusion opioid analgesic require heel lance purpose medically-required capillary blood sample NG/OG tube insertion . Study participant randomly allocate receive 24 % sucrose solution placebo solution ( water ) . The maximum amount study solution administer accord infant 's gestational age accord hospital 's Sucrose policy : &lt; 28 week gestation = maximum dose 0.1 mL ; 28-31 week gestation = maximum dose 0.3 mL ; 32-35 week gestation = maximum dose 0.5 mL ; &gt; 36 week gestation = maximum dose 0.5-1.0 mL . The primary outcome measure difference pain level heel lance procedure NG/OG tube insertion study population assess Premature Infant Pain Profile ( PIPP ) . Secondary outcome include ; ) total crying time ; ii ) skin conductance activity , valid , non-invasive , physiological measure pain stress infant . Statistical analysis : PIPP score , cry time , skin conductance activity summarize use mean standard deviation normally distribute , median interquartile range ( IQR ) non-normally distribute . An intention treat analysis perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants inpatient NICU : Who receive continuous intravenous infusion opioid analgesic morphine fentanyl maximum dose equivalent 20 mcg/kg/hr morphine follow either abdominal ( gastrointestinal renal ) thoracic surgery ; Who require heel lance medically require blood sample nasogastric/orogastric ( NG/OG ) tube insertion ; Who eligible receive sucrose per hospital 's Sucrose policy infant . Infants expose antenatal methadone Infants , aside opioid analgesic , ineligible receive sucrose per hospital 's Sucrose policy38 If infant 's mother wish breastfeed procedure Infants know suspect fructose intolerance Infants spinal cord malformation ( e.g . myelomeningocele sacral teratoma ) since infant 's response , sensitivity pain may differ infant without spinal cord malformation Infants unconscious , heavily sedate absent gag and/or swallow reflex Infants isolation essential personnel care To ensure interaction effect muscle relaxant , may impact infant ' ability mount behavioural response pain , assessment conduct period 24 hour since previous muscle relaxant dose .
