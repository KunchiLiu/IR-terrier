	<brief_title>Chloroquine Combination With VELCADE Cyclophosphamide Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Chloroquine may help chemotherapy drug work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving bortezomib cyclophosphamide together chloroquine may kill cancer cell .</detailed_description>
