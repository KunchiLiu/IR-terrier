	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death worldwide United States . The majority lung cancer non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The majority NSCLC case advance time diagnosis . Chemotherapy improve overall survival remain limited &lt; 12 month median overall survival . New approach need second line chemotherapy treatment . Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 show increased overall survival metastatic prostate cancer hopeful advance NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial number patient lung cancer progress first line treatment require second line chemotherapy . Lung cancer appear account 40-50 % know brain metastasis . The incidence brain metastasis among lung cancer patient range 16-20 % . Chemotherapy limited utility due problem cross blood brain barrier . Currently three drug approve FDA second line treatment NSCLC distinct toxicity . Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 potent novel taxane enhance activity increase number cell line include lung , prostate , colon , pancreas , head neck , kidney , gastric , glioblastoma , melanoma . It also ability cross blood brain barrier . Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 find improved antiproliferative activity chemotherapy agent insensitive cell line . The Phase I study Cabazitaxel-SRP6258 determine dosage schedule recommendation advance NSCLC patient utilized Phase II multicenter study . Subjects place one two schedule ( A B ) specify dosage administration schedule . All subject follow survival/progression every 2 cycle therapy image study . A two stage design use two schedule . Fourteen subject accrue schedule first stage possible accrual additional 34 subject per schedule depend upon first stage result .</detailed_description>
