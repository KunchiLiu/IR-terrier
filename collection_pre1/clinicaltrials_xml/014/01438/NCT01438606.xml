	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response VSV-Indiana HIV Vaccine Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many HIV vaccine development use virus vector deliver vaccine body 's cell order elicit immune response . Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) vector study animal . As HIV vaccine vector , show prevent disease progression monkey infect simian/human immunodeficiency virus ( SHIV ) . This study evaluate safety immune response VSV-Indiana ( one type VSV vector ) HIV gag vaccine healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . In addition , study researcher determine maximum dose vaccine safely tolerate . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Five group participant enrol , subsequent group receive slightly high dose vaccine . Within group , participant randomly assign receive study vaccine placebo vaccine . Study researcher examine safety data participant react study vaccine enrol next group participant . At baseline Week 8 , participant receive two injection study vaccine placebo vaccine—one upper arm time point . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination ; mouth examination ; medical medication history review ; saliva , blood , urine collection . Female participant also take pregnancy test . Participants complete questionnaire ass mental status receive counsel HIV risk reduction pregnancy prevention . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . For 7 day vaccination , participant record side effect symptom log . Participants attend study visit 3 day 1 2 week baseline study visit , Week 8 second vaccination , 3 day 1 2 week Week 8 visit , Months 5 8 . Follow-up study visit include select baseline study procedure . Participants contact annually 3 year follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
