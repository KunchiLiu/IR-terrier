	<brief_title>An Open Label Study Genecept™ Assay Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genomind sponsor open label study Assay Guided Treatment ( AGT ) use Genecept Assay adult outpatient Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder . The Genecept Assay Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) laboratory validate test research determine information genetic variation impact patient outcome . The propose investigation examine potential impact Assay term depression severity measure change CGI scale 3 month . Secondary measure assess change Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms ( QIDS-SR ) , Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( Q-LES-Q ) Zung self-rated anxiety scale 3 month . Additional measure include change clinician treatment diagnosis decision impact mediation side effect use Udvalg Kliniske Undersøgelser Side Effect Rating Scale ( UKU ) . Participant data compare match control cohort ass impact use Genecept Assay medication adherence total claim . Patients diagnosis non-psychotic Major Depressive Disorder identify . These patient treat clinician recruit . The present study propose enroll 1 . Subjects ( patient identify eligible ) 2 . Clinician study participant ( clinician identify responsible care eligible patient ) . This study involve collection response Subjects clinician study participant intention correlate information Subject genetic data . Potential subject study participant consent electronically secure study portal . Patients Clinicians must consent participate order proceed study . After subject clinician study participant consent participate , ask complete electronic baseline survey . Once baseline survey complete , clinician receive Genecept Assay mail supervise collection saliva DNA sample routine office visit . At baseline , month 1 month 3 , patient Subjects prompt complete survey include question psychiatric symptom , quality life medication side effect . The 3 month patient assessment also include satisfaction questionnaire . At baseline , clinician study participant prompt complete brief survey contain question patient 's psychiatric history severity illness , current treatment regimen treatment intention clinician prior receive genetic result . After receive result Assay , clinician study participant prompt complete online study survey contain question related impact Genecept Assay treatment diagnosis decision . The subject continue treatment determine clinician study participant . At 3 month baseline , clinician study participant ask complete online survey additional question relate subsequent change patient 's treatment regimen illness severity since receiving/implementing result Assay .</detailed_description>
