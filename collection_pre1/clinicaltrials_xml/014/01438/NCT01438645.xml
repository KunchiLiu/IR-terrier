	<brief_title>ScopeGuide-assisted Colonoscopy Versus Conventional Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary Research Proposal Background : Colon rectal cancer ( CRC ) lead cause cancer-related morbidity mortality Canada . Colonoscopy prefer screen modality CRC show decrease likelihood develop CRC well CRC-related mortality , particularly detection removal potentially pre-cancerous polyp , aim prevent colon cancer , diagnosis early stage CRC likely treatable result long-term survival . However , recent evidence suggest colonoscopy universally protective CRC previously hop , particularly proximal cancer locate right colon . Theories might case include speculation altered biology cancer develop proximal colon technical issue relate performance colonoscopy . In particular , one problem incomplete colonoscopy fails examine entire colon cecum , may occur 10-20 % case . Furthermore , public health standpoint , considerable proportion population remain averse undergoing colonoscopy , particularly fears procedure discomfort , decrease potential impact overall CRC reduction . Thus , optimize technical performance colonoscopy improve acceptance among patient important maximize possible benefit society . One common reason incomplete colonoscopy excessive internal looping endoscope . This looping also show major cause patient discomfort procedure . Experts agree colonoscopy successful reach cecum comfortable patient endoscope keep straight position minimize loop formation reduce loop form . Thus , identification reduction endoscope loop critically important successful comfortable completion colonoscopy . Over year , several technique emerge overcome loop formation , include withdrawal endoscope torque , abdominal wall pressure patient position change , yet do `` trial error '' fashion . Despite limitation , maneuver form cornerstone current colonoscopy technique . Technological innovation small caliber `` pediatric '' colonoscopes `` variable stiffness '' colonoscope adjustable rigidity introduce moderate success diminish patient discomfort increase rate colonoscopy completion . Yet despite effort improve colonoscopy practice , reality many procedure still do poorly . An audit colonoscopy perform Winnipeg 2004 2006 demonstrate dismal completion rate 65 % . Thus , something clearly need do . In effort help improve colonoscopy technical standpoint endoscopist also comfort level patient , Olympus redesign previously develop real-time image system enable visualization shape entire endoscope inside patient 's body . This technology , call ScopeGuide ( Olympus America , Center Valley , PA ) , consist electromagnetic coil embed within endoscope detect external receiver dish , generate 3D representation endoscope display monitor . It anticipate visualize entire scope move body , endoscopists gain useful visual information loop formation scope position enable great technical success create comfortable patient experience . Study Objectives : The purpose project perform randomize , non-blinded colonoscopy study determine real time visualization colonoscope use new Olympus ScopeGuide system superior conventional colonoscopy achievement endoscopic procedural outcome improved patient experience term reduce discomfort decrease sedation requirement . Methods : Consecutive patient refer colonoscopy University Alberta Hospital ( UAH ) consider study enrollment . Eligible patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion provide inform consent randomize undergo conventional colonoscopy colonoscopy assistance ScopeGuide system . The control group use Olympus CF-H180AL variable-stiffness , high-definition colonoscope differ usual procedure investigational group use Olympus CF-H180DL variable-stiffness , high-definition colonoscope equip ScopeGuide capability . ScopeGuide provide endoscopist 3-dimensional image monitor depict shape colonoscope inside patient 's body move colon . The colonoscopy perform clinically indicate , either without aid ScopeGuide system . All patient undergo purgative bowel preparation follow overnight fast prior colonoscopy accord standard clinical practice UAH . At start colonoscopy , patient initially give standardized dos conscious sedation medication consist midazolam 2 mg IV fentanyl 25 mcg IV . However , procedure may initiate without sedation upon patient request . Additional dos sedative medication may give patient request nurse physician believe patient uncomfortable . In case , endoscopist attempt minimize formation loop within colon straighten loop whenever possible . This achieve conventional method rely `` feel '' `` instinct '' control group direct ScopeGuide visualization investigational group . The endoscopist may use technical maneuver deem necessary facilitate completion procedure , include application external abdominal pressure nurse , reposition patient , tighten variable-stiffness set colonoscope . Upon intubation cecum , insertion distance colonoscope anus cecal pole record marker straightness endoscope . Any abnormality detect colonoscope insertion closely inspect , photograph biopsied subsequent colonoscope withdrawal . Furthermore , polyp also preferentially remove colonoscope withdrawal , exist standard-of-care . Any diagnostic therapeutic application require colonoscopy permit clinically indicate . Relevant demographic clinical information record prior procedure . Additional data regard procedural metric , technical maneuver , sedation dos record colonoscopy . At conclusion colonoscopy , endoscopist rate procedural difficulty `` usual '' `` difficult '' also note procedural diagnosis . After procedure , patient keep post-endoscopy recovery area usual fashion . Prior discharge home recovery area , participant complete visual analogue scale reflect degree discomfort experience procedure .</detailed_description>
