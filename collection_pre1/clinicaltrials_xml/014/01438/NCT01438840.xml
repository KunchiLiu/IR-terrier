	<detailed_description>This study consist three phase : Prerandomization , Randomization ( Core Study ) Extension study . The overall duration treatment ( Core Extension ) approximately 104 week Core study 26 week Extension study 76 week . Approximately 45 participant 18 year age meet eligibility requirement randomize . No single platelet count great 35x10^9/L ( liter ) . Participants centrally stratify randomization splenectomy status , baseline platelet count , use concomitant ITP medication baseline , randomize receive either double-blind avatrombopag placebo 2:1 ratio . Participants receive blind therapy start dose 20 mg avatrombopag placebo daily . Participants allow dose titrate ( maximum dose 40 mg avatrombopag match placebo ) ( minimum dose 5 mg avatrombopag match placebo ) depend response study drug . The goal dose modification maintain platelet count level great equal 50x10^9/L less equal 150x10^9/L , decrease need ITP-directed concomitant medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Men woman great equal 18 year age 2 . Participants diagnose cITP ( great equal 12 month duration ) accord American Society Hematology/British Committee Standards Hematology ( ASH/BCSH ) guideline , average 2 platelet count great 30x10^9/L ) . The physical exam suggest disease may cause thrombocytopenia ITP 3 . Participants previously receive one ITP therapy ( include , limited corticosteroid , immunoglobulin , azathioprine , danazol , cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab ) . 4 . Participants must either initially respond ( platelet count great 50x10^9/L ) previous ITP therapy bone marrow examination consistent ITP within 3 year rule myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) cause thrombocytopenia 5 . Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must within 80 % 120 % normal range history hypercoagulable state 6 . A complete blood count within reference range ( include white blood count [ WBC ] differential indicative disorder ITP ) , follow exception : hemoglobin : participant hemoglobin level 10 g/dL ( 100 g/L ) low limit normal ( LLN ) eligible inclusion , anemia clearly attributable ITP ( excessive blood loss ) ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/uL ( 1.5x10^9/L ) ( elevate WBC/ANC due corticosteroid treatment acceptable ) 1 . Participants know secondary immune thrombocytopenia ( e.g. , know Helicobacter pyloriinduced ITP participant infect known human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] participant know systemic lupus erythematosus ) . ( Revised per Amendment 01 ) 2 . Participants significant medical condition may impact safety participant interpretation study result ( e.g. , acute hepatitis , active chronic hepatitis ; lymphoproliferative disease ; myeloproliferative disorder , leukemia ) 3 . History MDS 4 . History gastric atrophy ( add per Amendment 01 ) 5 . History pernicious anemia participant vitamin B12 deficiency ( define less LLN ) pernicious anemia exclude cause ( add per Amendment 01 ) 6 . Any prior history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , two follow risk factor : hormone replacement therapy , estrogencontaining hormone replacement contraceptive therapy , smoking , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , medication hypertension , cancer , hereditary thrombophilic disorder ( e.g. , Factor V Leiden , antithrombin III deficiency , etc . ) , family history arterial venous thrombosis 7 . Participants history significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure [ CHF ] New York Heart Association Grade III/IV , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event [ e.g. , atrial fibrillation ] , participant QT interval correct heart rate &gt; 450 msec , angina , coronary artery stent placement , angioplasty , coronary artery bypass graft ) 8 . Participants history cirrhosis , portal hypertension , chronic active hepatitis 9 . Participants concurrent malignant disease 10 . Use immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) within 1 week randomization 11 . Splenectomy use rituximab within 12 week randomization 12 . Use romiplostim eltrombopag within 4 week randomization 13 . Participants currently treat corticosteroid azathioprine receive stable dose least 4 week prior randomization complete therapy 4 week prior randomization 14 . Participants currently treat MMF , CsA , danazol receive stable dose least 12 week prior randomization complete therapy 4 week prior randomization 15 . Use cyclophosphamide vinca alkaloid regimens within 4 week randomization 16 .
