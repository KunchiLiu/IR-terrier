	<brief_summary>The use design viral vector destroy cancer cell leave normal cell largely unharmed . The virus also stimulate immunological response produce special factor ( GM-CSF ) attract promote development dendritic T effector cell . It form hypothesis regimen may use people fail current form treatment recommend cystectomy . It hope novel therapy able delay potentially avoid cystectomy patient population . Bladder instillation agent cause little long lasting side effect may drastically improve stimulation immune system local cancer cell death well destroy tumor cell may travel regional lymph node distant organ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Recombinant Adenovirus Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After phase I/II CG0070 trial review , become apparent use CG0070 oncolytic vaccine intravesical agent oncolytic lysis tumor cell , together transcription GM-CSF site , may distinct advantage . This first study show excellent tumor response rate 48-77 % depend dose schedule administer . All patient residual non-muscle invasive bladder cancer previously fail BCG therapy time treatment . With addition transduction agent DDM , intravesical instillation CG0070 enable uniform distribution viral particle exposure tumor 30-60 minute instillation contrast intra-tumor injection , intra-arterial intravenous injection viral particle oncolytic viral trial . Some deliver methodology obvious intrinsic imperfection potential toxicity . This unique opportunity relatively easy intravesical tumor exposure difficult duplicate solid tumor model . The replication CG0070 majority patient first phase I/II trial indicate tumor lysis release tumor specific tumor associate antigens stably express , abundant quantity tumor cell death . Release tumor antigens key element , together sufficient on-site GM-CSF , stimulate strong cross-presentation confirmation signal antigen present cell dendritic cell interact CD4+ CD8+ T cell . This concept `` real time '' vaccine like regimen expect compare favorably form cancer immunotherapy treatment BCG patient population . It think CG0070 may find success set reasonably proven complete response rate residual fail BCG bladder cancer patient first phase I/II study ( case one instillation ) . Of importance well , demonstration study data strong GM-CSF expression replication phase . Those patient carcinoma situ disease RB pathway dysfunction particularly responsive . It therefore , desirable formulate protocol encompass specialty oncolytic vaccine unique intravesical delivery prove efficacy randomize control study . This opportunity allow study CG0070 's beneficial effect , , standard care carcinoma situ non muscle invasive bladder cancer patient fail BCG therapy . The prognosis group presently depend mainly early radical cystectomy , carry high morbidity decrease quality life generally view unacceptable group old patient .</detailed_description>
