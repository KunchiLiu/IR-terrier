	<brief_summary>This Phase I/IIa , multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , single-blinded dose-escalation study evaluate TNX-832 ( also refer ALT-836 Sunol cH36 ) subject suspected proven bacteria-induced ALI/ARDS . Up five cohort least six subject originally plan . Subjects randomize 5:1 ratio receive TNX-832 placebo , respectively , administer single bolus infusion 15 minute . Three cohort subject enrol study safety pharmacokinetics study treatment evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects TNX-832 ( Sunol cH36 ) Subjects With Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue factor ( TF ) transmembrane glycoprotein act principal initiator extrinsic coagulation pathway . TF key mediator immune system coagulation principal activator coagulation . The TF-FVIIa complex activates FX FIX , result cleavage prothrombin thrombin . Normally , localized activation coagulation cascade associate inflammatory response play role control spread infectious agent ; however , aberrant TF expression often lead serious thrombotic disorder . TF-dependent thrombosis associate many disease include septic shock , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , cancer , many inflammatory autoimmune disorder lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease . Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) form acute respiratory failure characterize diffuse pulmonary infiltrates , pulmonary hypertension , refractory hypoxemia , loss pulmonary compliance normal hydrostatic pressure . ALI ARDS commonly occur patient acute catastrophic event sepsis , trauma severe pulmonary infection . The incidence ALI ARDS extremely high patient sepsis . By block initiate event extrinsic coagulation activation , effect pro-inflammatory event lung disorder fibrin deposition may correct evolution severe structural functional injury may avert ALI/ARDS . TNX-832 ( formerly know Sunol-cH36 ) , direct human TF , block pathological complication TF-dependent thrombus formation . The blockage TNX-832 initiating event extrinsic coagulation pathway may attenuate effect pro-inflammatory event ALI/ARDS patient , thereby avert decrease disorder fibrin deposition avert evolution severe structural functional injury .</detailed_description>
