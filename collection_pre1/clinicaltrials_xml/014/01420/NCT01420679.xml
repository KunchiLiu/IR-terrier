	<brief_summary>The purpose study see pralatrexate extends response survival follow CHOP-based chemotherapy ( CHOP : cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) pralatrexate improves response patient partial response follow CHOP-based chemotherapy . Patients either receive pralatrexate observation . All patient receive vitamin B12 folic acid attend regular clinic visit evaluate disease health .</brief_summary>
