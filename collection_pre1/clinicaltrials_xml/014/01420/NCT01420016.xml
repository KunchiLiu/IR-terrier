	<detailed_description>The objective project develop implement sophisticated point-of-care EHR-based clinical decision support ( ) identifies ( b ) prioritize available evidence-based treatment option reduce give patient 's cardiovascular risk ( CVR ) . The prioritized list treatment option provide different format primary care physician ( PCP ) patient time office visit make patient moderate high CVR sub-optimally control potentially reversible CVR factor . Available evidence-based treatment option prioritize base magnitude potential CVR reduction treatment option . This intervention strategy , refer Prioritized Clinical Decision Support ( PCS ) , specifically design widespread use primary care setting potential substantially augment current effort control CVR 35 % American adult 10-year Framingham CVR 10 % high . To assess ability PCS intervention reduce CVR adult , randomize 18 primary care clinic 60 primary care physician ( PCPs ) approximately 18,000 eligible adult baseline Framingham 10-year risk major CV event ( either heart attack stroke ) 10 % one two experimental condition : Group 1 include 9 clinic ( 30 PCPs 9,000 patient ) receive prioritize clinical decision support ( PCS ) reduce CVR time clinical encounter make eligible adult . Group 2 include 9 clinic ( 30 PCPs 9,000 patient ) receive study intervention constitute usual care control group . The study formally test hypothesis control baseline CVR , post-intervention 10-year Framingham CVR good Group 1 Group 2 12 24 month start intervention . In addition , impact intervention specific component CVR ( BP , lipid , glucose , aspirin use , smoke ) assess , cost-effectiveness intervention quantify . This innovative project build upon 10 year prior work research team , extend prior successful EHR clinical decision support intervention introduce prioritization , provide decision support patient PCPs time office visit , extend decision support across broad critically important clinical terrain CVR reduction . The result project , whether positive negative , extend understand maximize clinical return massive public private sector investment make sophisticated outpatient EHR system . If successful , decision support tool could broadly use standardize personalize care deliver case manager , pharmacist , provider wide range care delivery configuration .</detailed_description>
