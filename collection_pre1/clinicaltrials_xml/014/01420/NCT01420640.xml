	<brief_title>Tai Chi Aerobic Exercise Fibromyalgia ( FMEx )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia ( FM ) chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome cause substantial physical psychological impairment cost $ 25 billion annually . Current pharmacological therapy may expensive , cause serious adverse effect , fail effectively improve pain function . Finding new effective non-pharmacological treatment FM patient urgently need . We propose conduct first comparative effectiveness trial Tai Chi vs. aerobic exercise ( recommended component current standard care ) evaluate effectiveness different Tai Chi dose schedule large FM population . We aim ( 1 ) demonstrate , compare aerobic exercise , Tai Chi effective intervention manage pain improve functional limitation impact quality life FM patient , 2 ) determine optimal frequency duration supervise Tai Chi intervention relation short long-term effectiveness . To achieve goal , conduct single-blind , randomize control trial Tai Chi vs. aerobic exercise 216 patient meet American College Rheumatology criterion FM . Patients randomize one four Tai Chi intervention group : 12 24 week supervise Tai Chi give twice per week , supervise aerobic exercise control : 2x/week 24 week . All group 52-week follow-up .
