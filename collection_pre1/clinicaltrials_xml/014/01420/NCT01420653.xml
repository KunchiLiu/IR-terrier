	<brief_title>Maxigesic 325 Acute Dental Pain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination 500mg acetaminophen 150mg ibuprofen show improve analgesia compare individual component , give 2 tablet ( i.e . total 1,000/300 mg ) 4 time day . Recent concern safety acetaminophen lead regulatory agency restrict maximum dose acetaminophen per tablet 325 mg , maintain maximum daily dose 4000mg per day . A dose regimen three tablet Maxigesic 325 four time day give total daily dose 3900mg acetaminophen 1170mg ibuprofen . The primary objective study compare time-adjusted SPID VAS pain intensity score 48 hour first dose study medication among four study group . Secondary objective : To compare time onset pain relief first dose study drug define ( ) perceptible ( ii ) meaningful pain relief among four study group use two stopwatch method . To compare maximum VAS pain score 48 hour first dose study medication among four study group . To compare response rate ( response rate define percentage participant reduce pain intensity score least 50 % compare baseline VAS measure ) among four study group . To compare time peak reduction VAS pain intensity score follow first dose study medication among four study group . To compare time requirement rescue medication among four study group . To compare percentage participant use rescue medication among four study group . To compare amount rescue medication use ( defined number tablet ) among four study group . To compare categorical global pain rating among four study group . Safety : To compare adverse event rate 48-hour study period Day 30 among four treatment group . To compare incidence know specific NSAID paracetamol side effect ( e.g . GI ulceration bleeding , indigestion/stomach pain , post-operative bleeding , bronchospasm , skin rash , water retention , renal failure , thromboembolic event evidence clinical hepatitis ) 48-hour study period Day 30 among four study group . Planned hospital admission and/or surgical operation illness disease exist study drug give participant randomize study consider adverse event .</detailed_description>
