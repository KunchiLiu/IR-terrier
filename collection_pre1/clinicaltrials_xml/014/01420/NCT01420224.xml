	<brief_title>Study Effects Commercial Air Travel Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In commercial airliner fly high altitude , reduce cabin air pressure mean passenger expose slightly lower oxygen level ( 'hypoxia ' ) equivalent altitude approximately 5,000 8,000 ft . Although mild , hypoxia sufficient stimulate body 's protective response ( eg change breathe hormonal secretion ) dangerous passenger heart lung disease , must breathe supplementary oxygen in-flight may even prohibit fly risk hypoxia . It well know severe hypoxia result constriction blood vessel lung ( phenomenon call hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ) , turn cause increase blood pressure lung ( 'pulmonary arterial pressure ' ) . Unlike physiological response hypoxia , often harmful frequently lead pulmonary hypertension right heart failure ( eg lung disease high altitude ) . Even modest increase pulmonary arterial pressure could clinically important airline passenger heart/lung disease , may exacerbate condition . However , know whether mild hypoxia experience aircraft cabin able cause increase pulmonary artery pressure . Limited evidence suggests might - example , report passenger acutely develop new right heart failure in-flight , data animal study also support possibility . This study aim establish effect mild aircraft cabin hypoxia pulmonary arterial pressure healthy passenger also patient Chuvash polycythaemia . In rare genetic disease , cellular response hypoxia 'switched ' extent even normoxia , cause increase red blood cell production . Affected individual usually present symptom polycythaemia early adulthood typically asymptomatic follow treatment therapeutic venesection . Importantly , affected individual exaggerate acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may place risk pulmonary hypertensive response air travel .</detailed_description>
