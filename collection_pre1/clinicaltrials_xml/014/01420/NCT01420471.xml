	<brief_summary>All adult patient undergo sinus surgery chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion include study . All patient enrol study spacers ( impregnated saline Triamcinolone ) insert middle meati sinus surgery . Patients serve control . Nostril 's randomize either experimental treatment ( Triamcinolone-impregnated spacer ) control treatment ( Saline-impregnated spacer ) . These spacers remove 6-days post-op . Participants undergo standard post-operative endoscopic sinus surgery follow-up appointment plus one additional research visit ( standard care ) . This include follow-up appointment 6 day , 14 day , 5 week , 3 month , 6 month post-operative period . During appointment , surgeon assess post-operative mucosal appearance ( Philpott-Javer Sinus Rating System ) . SNOT-22 survey administer , per standard protocol , post-op follow visit . Sinus tissue biopsy take meati 28-day 3-month post-op follow-up appointment analysis . Our objective determine triamcinolone soak Merocel middle meatus spacers ( MMS ) perforate glove finger improve patient outcome , wound heal reduces inflammation compare standard saline-soaked merocel sponge within perforate glove finger CRS patient receive FESS . Our hypothesis triamcinolone-medicated Merocel MMS inferior standard saline-soaked spacers , enclose perforated surgical glove finger .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medicated Punctured-Glove-Finger Spacer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer chronic rhinosinusitis undergo Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ( FESS ) require nasal spacers insert intra-operatively middle-meatus prevent lateralization middle turbinate subsequent scarring adhesion . Nasal spacers impregnate topical steroid assist post-surgical recovery . Our centre investigate effect triamcinolone-medicated nasal spacers place inside puncture glove finger improve wound healing . All patient enrol study spacers ( impregnated saline Triamcinolone ) insert middle meati sinus surgery . Patients serve control . One nostril receive experimental treatment ( Triamcinolone-impregnated spacer ) one receive control treatment ( Saline-impregnated spacer ) . These spacers remove 6-days post-op . Randomization patient ' nostril treatment arm occur day surgery base close envelope system . Participants undergo standard post-operative endoscopic sinus surgery follow-up appointment plus one additional research visit ( standard care ) . This include follow-up appointment 6 day , 14 day , 5 week , 3 month , 6 month post-operative period . The 14-day follow-up appointment additional visit include standard practice centre . However , study patient add visit order closely observe recovery endoscopic evaluation . During appointment , surgeon assess post-operative appearance ( Philpott-Javer Sinus Rating System ) , number infection , pain , 1st week post-operative bleeding ( 6 day visit ) . The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) questionnaire complete study participant 6 day , 14 day , 5 week , 3 month post-operative period . The SNOT-22 5-minute questionnaire consist 22 question , ask participant rate sinus symptom social/emotional consequence nasal disorder `` problem '' `` problem bad . '' Sinus tissue biopsy also take meati intraoperatively ( standard care ) 28-day 3-month post-op follow-up appointment ( standard care ) . Biopsies send pathologist grade scale tissue inflammation . To grade level mucosal inflammation objective fashion , pathologist previously devise grading system scale 0 4 . A score 0 give normal tissue , 1 submucosal inflammation inflammatory infiltrate epithelium , 2 inflammatory infiltrate neutrophil epithelium evidence necrosis , 3 inflammatory infiltrate neutrophil epithelium evidence focal necrosis 4 inflammatory infiltrate neutrophil epithelium evidence extensive necrosis ( 5 ) .</detailed_description>
