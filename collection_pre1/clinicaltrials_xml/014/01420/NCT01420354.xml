	<brief_title>Can Spot Urine Replace Improve 24 Hour Urine Collections Kidney Stone Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Urinary stone disease common problem , cause significant morbidity sometimes mortality . Stone disease affect 5-10 % population lifetime patient 30-50 % least one recurrent episode . Urinary stone arise due crystallization aggregation supersaturated ion complex urine . Depending concentration various urinary constituent physicochemical characteristic give individual 's urine ( pH , volume , calcium citrate concentration etc . ) , different crystal may precipitate . Therefore therapy tailor individual , base stone composition result 24-hour urine collection . The majority stone calcium base ( calcium oxalate , calcium phosphate ) remain comprise uric acid , struvite , cystine substance . While stone pass spontaneously , majority require form treatment , 50 % require surgical intervention . Until 1980s , treatment upper urinary tract stone often involved extensive open surgical procedures5 . With introduction extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) refinements endourological procedure like percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) , ureteroscopy ( URS ) technique , become possible treat stone almost case without open surgery . Stone management divide three treatment phase . The first phase involve treatment acute pain drainage obstruct possibly infect kidney . The second phase aim either remove disintegrate stone . The third phase direct towards prophylaxis stone recurrence . The third phase involve metabolic evaluation patient identify possible risk factor form recurrent stone , consist 24 hour urine analysis determine content urinary component calcium oxalate play major role stone disease . High level oxalate calcium contribute kidney stone recurrence therapy reduce two substance urine reduce recurrence rate . Low level citrate also increase risk form stone , treat alkali potassium citrate . Collecting 24-hour urines evaluation therapy cumbersome patient often lead incorrect collection , may detectable measure amount creatinine sample . Previous attempt evaluate spot versus 24-hour urine make , study necessary determine compare conventional 24-hour collection . A convenient method collect urine sample facilitate treatment future prevention recurrent kidney stone disease . The aim project determine whether spot urine collect separately key time throughout day comparable conventional pool 24-hour urine collection , whether former yield accurate information term level urinary component . Perhaps patient normal value pool 24-hour collection may show spike certain variable throughout day would discover 24-hour sample . Furthermore , reduce collection single time point would improve patient compliance make easy subsequent follow-up collection . HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES We hypothesize spot urine provide equivalent information provide 24-hour urine test . An added benefit would spot urines provide information identification risk factor patient normal 24-hour urine test . A third possibility hypothesis incorrect 24-hour urine sample provide useful data formulate stone prevention therapy patient .</detailed_description>
