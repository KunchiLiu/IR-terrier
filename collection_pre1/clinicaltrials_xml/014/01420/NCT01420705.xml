	<brief_summary>The prevalence asthma allergic disease increase worldwide . Infections vaccination childhood may impact subsequent development asthma allergy . In Guinea-Bissau , investigator previously find Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine associate reduction atopy . Since investigator conduct randomised trial BCG vaccine give birth low birth-weight infant . The present study aim follow child enrol BCG randomise trial ass asthma allergy later childhood .

	<detailed_description>Background : Prevalence asthma allergy increase worldwide , cause unclear . Previous work Bandim Health Project others identify infection routine childhood vaccination impact development atopic sensitisation allergic symptom later life . A number study find association BCG vaccination reduction atopy allergy . Only one randomise trial conduct BCG vaccine protect allergy inconclusive result . The present project provide opportunity follow-up child bear low birth-weight randomise receive BCG vaccine birth receive BCG later infancy part regular care . Hypothesis : - Children give BCG vaccine birth reduce prevalence positive skin-prick test allergic symptom compare child receive BCG birth - Early BCG vaccination associate reduce prevalence positive skin prick test allergic symptom - Early DTP vaccination associate increase prevalence positive skin-prick test allergic symptoms Objectives : - examine effect environmental factor , include BCG , DTP measles vaccine , atopy ( determined skin-prick test ) symptom asthma , eczema food allergy - examine sex-differential effect vaccination atopy allergic symptom - determine association faecal microbial diversity , atopy food allergy Methods : child previously enrol NCT00146302 follow home ( currently age 3-9 year ) test atopic sensitisation skin-prick test presence allergic symptom determine questionnaire . Sample size : 812 child Bandim Health Project study area enrol randomised trial . The investigator anticipate able follow approximately 487 child , power detect 30 % difference atopic sensitisation group .</detailed_description>
