	<brief_title>LOGIC-Insulin Algorithm-guided Versus Nurse-directed Blood Glucose Control During Critical Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical illness typically cause elevated blood glucose concentration , associate increased mortality . Strictly normalize blood glucose level intensive insulin therapy , call tight glycemic control , decrease morbidity mortality well-controlled single-center clinical study . However , multi-center pragmatic trial fail reproduce effect , prove implementation tight glycemic control daily clinical practice rather difficult . A computerized algorithm , amongst others , may help nurse titration insulin reach normal blood glucose level avoid particularly worrisome hypoglycemia . The LOGIC-1 study single blind randomize control trial . On admission patient randomly assign either tight glycemic control ( 80-110 mg/dL ) computerize LOGIC-Insulin 3.0 algorithm tight glycemic control ( 80-110 mg/dL ) nurse-directed protocol . Written inform consent ask patient case elective surgery require post-operative ICU-admission . Proxy inform consent close family member ask patient admit ICU emergency . As blood glucose control essential management critical illness , random allocation do admission write informed consent close family member defer maximum 24 hour randomization . The patient family member time withdraw trial without impact treatment . Allocation do block ( block size unknown care giver responsible treatment allocation ) , stratify cardiac surgery reason ICU admission , central computer randomization . The time window study 14 day start admission ICU one follow stop criterion meet : - Withdrawal informed consent - Patient start eat drink sugar contain liquid - Patient discharge ICU ( include ICU death ) - Removal arterial line central venous line Under follow condition study investigator/treating physician contact , necessary , patient switch LOGIC-Insulin nurse-directed blood glucose control : - Recurrent severe hypoglycemia ( &lt; 40 mg/dL ) - Refractory hyperglycemia - Any change condition compromise safety patient , judge investigator treat physician The common strategy blood glucose control group involve blood glucose measurement arterial blood blood gas analyzer administration insulin central line syringe pump .</detailed_description>
