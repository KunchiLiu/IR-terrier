	<brief_summary>This single-center , open-label , non-randomized Phase I study weekly Cabazitaxel concurrent intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) ( A type 3-dimensional radiation therapy use computer-generated image show size shape tumor . Thin beams radiation different intensity aim tumor many angle . ) androgen deprivation therapy ( Treatment suppress block production action male hormone ) patient locally advanced prostate cancer . It hop add Cabazitaxel standard IMRT , great local disease control achieve eventually cure rate increase . After study , maximally tolerate dose Cabazitaxel could use combination radiation find . Men locally advance high risk prostate cancer represent group patient cure potentially achievable utilizing multimodality approach . More aggressive treatment upfront chemotherapy ADT may improve long term disease control . We hypothesize Cabazitaxel may add radiation therapy safely , anticipate novel approach improve disease control eventually improve survival locally advanced prostate cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients locally advanced high Gleason grade prostate cancer often local metastatic disease progression . To improve outcome , therapy need direct control androgen sensitive insensitive prostate cancer cell primary metastatic site . This therapeutic challenge prompt use combine modality approach incorporate chemotherapy hormonal therapy radiation aim intrinsically resistant cell micrometastatic disease androgen sensitive resistant . High likelihood occult metastatic disease existence intrinsically castration resistant cell main rationale early institution androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) chemotherapy prostate cancer . The rationale combining chemotherapeutic agent ADT radiotherapy high risk prostate cancer patient base chemotherapy enhance radiotherapy also effective therapy metastatic castrate resistant disease . Prior study weekly docetaxel ADT intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) safe feasible however cabazitaxel potent mitotic inhibitor may enhance outcome patient locally advanced prostate cancer . Men locally advance high risk prostate cancer represent group patient cure potentially achievable utilizing multimodality approach . More aggressive treatment upfront chemotherapy ADT would improve long term disease control . We hypothesize Cabazitaxel may add radiation therapy safely , anticipate novel approach improve disease control eventually improve survival locally advanced prostate cancer patient . The safety combination Cabazitaxel radiation establish study . Potential efficacy determine future phase II/III trial . Hypofraction radiation treatment short duration maybe possible combine chemotherapy modality .</detailed_description>
