	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether adjunctive therapy standard antibiotic treatment BT086 safe effective decreasing day patient require endotracheal ventilation due Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( sCAP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study BT086 Evaluate Adjunctive Therapy sCAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( sCAP ) usually define clinically pneumonia acquire outside hospital ( CAP ) require intensive medical care . Mortality ( ) CAP patient admit ICU range 35-58 % depend time admission patient much improve last year . BT086 contain sufficient number antibody frequent pathogen well antibody lipopolysaccharides lipid A . Therefore , assume administration BT086 early clinical course severe infection sCAP may provide effective adjunctive treatment standard antibiotic therapy sCAP patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent : give patient legal/authorised representative patient waiver write informed consent due emergency situation , compliance local legal requirement . Male female patient age 18 year old Patient receive adequate antibiotic treatment pneumonia Prior endotracheal ventilation therapy , patient must least one follow two sign inflammation : Fever/Hypothermia Fever define oral , tympanic , oesophageal vesical temperature &gt; 38°C , tympanic temperature &gt; 38°C rectal temperature &gt; 38.5°C , hypothermia ( rectal temperature &lt; 35.5°C ) ( measurement temperature probe device ) White blood cell ( WBC ) count &gt; 10,000/mm³ WBC &lt; 4,500/mm³ Patient must least one follow sign symptom pneumonia : New increase cough Production purulent sputum change sputum characteristic Dyspnoea tachypnoea ( respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/minute ) Pleuritic chest pain Auscultatory finding pulmonary examination rale and/or crackle and/or evidence pulmonary consolidation ( e.g . dullness percussion , bronchial breath sound , egophony ) Radiological ( image technique ) evidence ( ) infiltrate ( ) consistent bacterial pneumonia Pneumonia acquire outside hospital . In hospitaladmitted patient , pneumonia diagnose maximum 72 hour admission . Patients nurse home similar institution eligible . Major sCAP criterion : need endotracheal ventilation Treatment patient BT086 must start within 12 hour earlier 1 hour start endotracheal ventilation For incapacitated patient : indication patient 's presume would inclusion trial Patients suspect hospitalacquired pneumonia Severe lung disease interfere sCAP therapy e.g . patient cystic fibrosis , Patients receive Xigris® ( drotrecogin alfa , activate Protein C ) medication approve sCAP ( e.g . Dornase alpha ) exclude inclusion study Patients dialysis Presence severe disease impair life expectancy ( e.g . patient expect survive 28 day give preexist uncorrectable medical condition ) . Patients unable treated due obesity Selective , absolute IgA deficiency know antibody IgA Patients neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm³ platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm³ Pregnant lactate woman . A pregnancy test perform woman age &lt; 65 year result must available study inclusion . Known relevant intolerance immunoglobulin , vaccine substance human origin Participation another interventional clinical trial within 30 day enter study study , and/or previous participation study ( participation noninterventional trial allow ) .</criteria>
