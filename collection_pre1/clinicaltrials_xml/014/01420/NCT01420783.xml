	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - Dose Ranging Phase : To evaluate efficacy daily oral dos 100 , 200 , 400 mg SAR302503 patient PV ET resistant intolerant hydroxyurea ( per European LeukemiaNet criterion ) : - Inducing absence phlebotomy hematocrit 45 % minimum 3 month patient polycythemia vera , - Reduction platelet count ≤400 x 10x9/L minimum 3 month patient essential thrombocythemia . - PV Dose Expansion Phase ET Dose Ranging Phase ( 600 mg dose group ) : To evaluate efficacy daily oral SAR302503 patient PV ET resistant intolerant hydroxyurea ( per European LeukemiaNet criterion ) : - Inducing absence phlebotomy eligibility begin Day 1 Cycle 4 visit continue Day 1 Cycle 6 visit patient PV , - Reduction platelet count ≤400 x 10x9/L begin Day 1 Cycle 4 visit continue Day 1 Cycle 6 visit patient ET . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety SAR302503 . - To evaluate efficacy SAR302503 patient PV resistant intolerant hydroxyurea induce absence phlebotomy eligibility . - To evaluate efficacy SAR302503 patient ET resistant intolerant hydroxyurea reduction platelet count . - To evaluate efficacy SAR302503 induce complete partial response begin Day 1 Cycle 6 visit Cycle 8 . - To evaluate splenic response measure spleen volume use MRI CT. - To evaluate pharmacokinetics SAR302503 single repeat dos . - To evaluate pharmacodynamics SAR302503 measure change JAK2V617F allele burden patient JAK2V617F mutation , STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition . - To measure improvement baseline myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) -associated symptom , well overall impact quality life . - To measure generic health-related quality life utility value use EuroQol Group ( EQ-5DTM ) questionnaire .</brief_summary>
