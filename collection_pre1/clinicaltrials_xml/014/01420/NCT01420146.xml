	<brief_title>Pilot Imaging Study With 89Zr-Trastuzumab HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first belgian feasibility study HER2 image use labelled monoclonal antibody , namely trastuzumab label zirconium 89 . The aim study : I/ Evaluate diagnostic potential HER2 image use zirconium 89 label trastuzumab ( base Groningen experience ) , analysis correlation FDG-PET/CT HER2 immunoPET . II/ PET quantification HER2 receptor use image blood pharmacokinetic tracer . III/ In subset patient biopsies metastatic site carry previously easy access , tissue acquire part validation HER2 immunoPET attempt well understand molecular heterogeneity HER2 positive breast cancer time relapse . IV/Evaluate concentration circulate HER2 extracellular domain blood study possible role imaging quality</detailed_description>
