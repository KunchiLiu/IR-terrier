	<brief_title>Partial Pulpotomy Caries Free Human Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize single blind clinical trial . Setting conduct : Twenty caries free premolar teeth fifteen patient assign orthodontic extraction include . Participants include major eligibility criterion : Their parent need sign inform form , Patients n't systematic complication , The teeth free symptom , caries decalcification reveal normal response pulp sensitivity test , No mobility swell surround soft tissue , sensitivity palpation percussion present . Intervention : A class one cavity prepared depth increase pulp exposure occur . One millimeter coronal pulp remove . Then exposure site cover use two pulpotomy agent : White ProRoot MTA control group iRoot BP . After six week ( 42 day ) teeth extract radiographic clinical examination find sign swelling , abscess sinus tract . Main outcome measure ( variable ) : The teeth section examine compare presence dentinal bridge , thickness feature term tunnel defect formation . The underlie pulp assess grade accord degree inflammation follow : grade 0 inflammation , grade 1 mild inflammation , grade 2 moderate inflammation , grade 3 severe inflammation , grade 4 abscess formation necrosis . Our criterion base ISO 7405 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients assign extract two premolar teeth one jaw orthodontic treatment plan . Their parent need read sign fully inform form . They n't systematic complication take medicine period study . The teeth need free symptom , caries decalcification They give normal response pulp sensitivity test ( cold test ) compare control tooth quadrant . The teeth need free mobility swell surround soft tissue sensitivity palpation percussion . On radiographic examination apical lucency PDL widening detect . tooth crack tooth fill caries hypocalcification The teeth show apical lucency PDL widening radiography sensitivity cold , heat bite The response beyond normal limit pulp vitality test Any medicine consumption</criteria>
