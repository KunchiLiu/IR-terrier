	<detailed_description>Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid ( Gadoxetate , Gd-EOB-DTPA , Primovist® ) newly develop paramagnetic hepatobiliary contrast agent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) base extracellular fluid marker gadopentetate ( Magnevist® ) . After intravenous administration , Gd-EOB-DTPA distribute rapidly within intravascular extracellular space take selectively hepatocytes . The compound eliminate blood body mainly two pathway : glomerular filtration kidney hepatobiliary excretion . There many evidence hepatic uptake Gd-EOB-DTPA sinusoidal blood influence specific hepatic transporter organic anion transporter ( OATP ) family . For highly liver specific agent demonstrate markedly improve quality detection focal liver lesion ( adenoma , focal nodular hyperplasia , hepatocellular carcinoma ) . Because gadoxetate take normal liver parenchyma well focal liver lesion hepatocellular origin , allow distinguish hepatocyte-containing non-hepatocyte-containing tissue . In indication ( e.g . preoperative evaluation patient hepatocellular carcinoma ) , liver-specific contrast medium like Gd-EOB-DTPA superior biphasic spiral computertomography . Hepatic enhancement intravenous administration Gd-EOB-DTPA known inhibit bromosulfophthalein , taurocholate rifampicin . Obviously , Gd-EOB-DTPA drug compete organic anion transporter hepatocytes . In Oatp1 cRNA inject oocyte Xenopus leavis , saturable uptake gadoxetic acid demonstrate . Since human organic anion transport polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 ( previous name : OATP-C , L-ST1 , OATP2 ) , responsible hepatic uptake several endogenous exogenous compound like bile acid , bilirubin , peptide , steroid conjugate , thyroid hormone , methotrexate , statins ezetimibe , predominantly express basolateral membrane hepatocytes , Gd-EOB-DTPA might substrate uptake transporter . Because described functional relevant single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) OATP1B1 , responsible markedly reduce transporter function even show alter plasma concentration pravastatin ezetimibe vivo , want investigate impact several genotype OATP1B1 disposition Gd-EOB-DTPA . While *15 *5 carrier OATP1B1 describe exhibit decreased lipid-lowering potency increase statin-induced myopathy , *1b carrier exert significantly reduce bioavailability ezetimibe . Due fact interesting haplotype like OATP1B1 *15 *1b fact relatively common European subject , intend define influence Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics different signal intensity magnetic resonance imaging liver . OATP 1B3 ( previous name : OATP8 , LST-2 ) , also predominantly express basolateral membrane hepatocytes , responsible hepatic uptake several endogenous exogenous compound like bile acid , 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol , BSP digoxin . There evidence recent experimental study laboratory , Primovist® substrate OATP1B1 also second liver specific uptake transporter OATP1B3 . The MRT contrast agent inhibits uptake BSP HEK tansfected human OATP1B1 OATP1B3 also well take cell non-transfected parental cell . Therefore , conclude OATP1B3 might additionally OATP1B1 specific uptake transporter human liver . Very recently , least six single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) OATP1B3 described literature . At least two described functional relevance : 334T &gt; G ( Ser112Ala ) 699G &gt; A ( met233Ile ) . The allele frequency 334T &gt; G 699G &gt; A variant European Caucasians report 74 % 71 % , respectively . The influence amino-acid substitution OATP1B3 transport function cellular localization seem substrate cell line dependent . In man , show OATP1B3*2 influence obviously hepatic uptake erythromycin hence result ERMBT ( erythromycin breath test ) cancer patient . Therefore , carrier OATP1B3 334T &gt; G OATP1B3 699G &gt; A plan include study Primovist® confirm whether selective hepatic uptake carrier OATP1B3 involve hepatic uptake MRI contrast agent additionally OATP1B1 . In several animal study reduce enhancement Gd-EOB-DTPA observe acute hepatitis , fatty liver cholestasis model . Obviously hepatic uptake gadexotate might determine liver disease lead alter function hepatocytes . Therefore aim study assess influence liver diseases Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics signal intensity possible modification OATP1B1-genotype 60 patient subject MR image liver .</detailed_description>
