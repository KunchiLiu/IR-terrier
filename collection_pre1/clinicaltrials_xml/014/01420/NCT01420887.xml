	<brief_title>Preservation Joint Function Using Postoperative Continuous Passive Motion ( CPM ) A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elbow stiffness reduce motion commonly occur elbow injury surgery . With traumatic injury elbow , contracture common complication . Indeed , expect case . For patient injury otherwise healthy , active require restoration full function order return previous level activity/work , reduce motion especially problematic even debilitate . The investigator find publish patient treat postoperative Continuous Passive Motion follow surgical repair stiffness able recover nearly prior elbow mobility function . Though CPM clinical use decade , prospective randomize clinical trial never publish prove effectiveness . The investigator believe intend show study rehabilitative benefit continuous passive motion ( CPM ) help preserve/restore joint function significantly improve rate recovery patient stiffness surgically repair . Specific Aim 1 : To demonstrate postoperative use CPM enhance tissue heal hastens recovery follow surgical release elbow contracture . Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate postoperative use CPM improve ultimate function follow surgical release elbow contracture . Specific Aim 3 : To demonstrate CPM cost-efficient treatment follow surgical release elbow contracture . Study Design : 50 patient require arthroscopic contracture release , randomly assign one two postoperative treatment group : Experimental - CPM Control - Physical Therapy . Participants study follow 12 month postoperatively . Throughout 12 month period impact/effectiveness CPM v Physical Therapy evaluate assess functional status , pain , mobility , general health relate quality life , utility , societal cost-effectiveness . In line mission National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases , study help anyone elbow injury result stiffness loss motion . Such study advantage highly translational potential immediate impact patient treatment care . The finding study able help patient immediately ensure principal Evidence Based Medicine apply patient type elbow injury receive treatment need best possible recovery base hard evidence scientific fact .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>To include , patient must meet ALL follow : 1 . Lack elbow flexion and/or extension , without pain . 2 . The contracture must present least six month fail respond nonsurgical treatment . 3 . Surgery perform arthroscopic capsulectomy osteocapsular arthroplasty removal heterotopic ossification necessary 1 . Contraindication use CPM regional brachial plexus block , bleed diathesis , use anticoagulant severe restriction shoulder range movement . 2 . Progressive recalcitrant neuropathy neuritis , except isolated intermittent ulnar neuritis . 3 . Preexisting factor might limit ability completely participate rehabilitation neuromuscular psychosocial condition . 4 . Progressive recurrent contracture due inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile idiopathic arthritis chondrolysis . 5 . Altered anatomy might limit elbow motion , independent condition treat , dysplasia , malunion , osteonecrosis , congenital deformity . 6 . A reasonable restoration motion function expect . 7 . Inadequate postoperative regional anesthesia 8 . Intraoperative postoperative complication could affect outcome 9 . Injury disease postoperative period could affect elbow function 10 . Not possible postoperative physical therapy appointment 11 . Significant portion procedure perform open manner 12 . Women know pregnant breastfeed 13 . Current prior septic arthritis</criteria>
