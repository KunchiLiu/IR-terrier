	<brief_summary>Background : - A person traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) -- also call concussion -- serious long-lasting effect . Doctors treat TBI need information brain change time people TBI well person recovers . To make exist TBI treatment effective develop new one , researcher want look closely TBI affect people physically psychologically . Objectives : - To collect medical information people recent traumatic brain injury compare information healthy volunteer person injury part body besides head ( broken bone , orthopedic injury , surgery ) . Eligibility : 3 group people age 18 70 year ask take part . - Persons traumatic brain injury ( concussion ) within past 30 day , OR - Persons healthy never traumatic brain injury , OR - Persons injury within past 30 day part body head ( broken bone , orthopedic injury , surgery ) Design : - This study require two outpatient visit last 1 1/2 day . The 2 visit 30 day apart . Persons TBI non-TBI injury must first visit within 30 day injury . - Screening : Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood test electrocradiogram ( ECG routine heart test ) . - The research involve : 1 . Giving blood sample ( 75 ml visit ) . 2 . Having test memory , attention , concentration , think ( neuropsychological testing ) . 3 . Having image study head include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . - Persons TBI test Visit 1 2 . Healthy control person non-TBI injury test Visit 1 list . But , Visit 2 , brain MRIs PETs . - No treatment provide part research protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability people age 45 industrialized country , specific treatment available TBI . Circulating endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) marker vascular injury mobilize signal cytokine , interleukin , MMP9 biomarkers ( BM ) may detect blood . However , relation EPC BM TBI severity quantify . MRI measurement lesion volume provide objective method TBI severity assessment outcome prediction . Moreover , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) sensitive detect TBI-related axonal injury , PET ( positron emission tomography ) useful functional interpretation image finding . This cross-sectional study aim determine whether EPC BM associate MRI , DTI PET finding , functional outcome TBI patient . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective study evaluate level EPC BMs participate EPC mobilization TBI patient comparison healthy volunteer non-TBI trauma control . The second objective relate EPC BM level TBI severity quantify functional radiological evaluation ( MRI , DTI PET ) . The third objective determine , relationship level EPC BM functional outcome . POPULATION : 100 male female participant 18 70 year age enrol within 30 day moderate TBI ( classify Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) 9-12 ) mild TBI ( GCS 13-15 ) . If participant post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) must last less 7 day loss consciousness ( LOC ) must last less 24 hour . Fifty healthy volunteer 50 person non-TBI injury ( broken bone , orthopedic injury surgery ) enrol . RESEARCH DESIGN : Before participate protocol , TBI non-TBI injured participant must receive routine clinical evaluation injury hospital , doctor office medical facility . They may refer NIH Clinical Center discharge may self-referred . They must willing medical record send NIH assure injury fit protocol inclusion criterion . Healthy volunteer may recruit family participant recruit NIH Patient Recruitment Public Liaison Office ( PRPL ) . This outpatient , observational study . Eligible participant come NIH two 1 1/2 day outpatient visit separate 30 day . Persons TBI test two visit : history physical exam , electrocardiogram , research blood draw ( 75 ml visit ) , pregnancy HIV testing , neuropsychological testing , head magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , positron emission tomography scan ( PET scan ) . Healthy control person non-TBI injury test visit 1 list . At visit 2 , test except brain MRIs PETs . IMPORTANCE : This study provide novel data regard association level EPC blood BMs severity imaging-positive TBI . This study provide foundation development interventional trial aim improve neovascularization TBI patient .</detailed_description>
