	<brief_summary>The purpose research study participant give T cell ( type blood cell body fight infection possibly cancer ) remove , grown lab , coat experimental drug . This study determine high dose EGFR2Bi coat T cell give without cause severe side effect . Initially group 3 participant receive dose study drug . If serious side effect occur , next group participant receive slightly high dose study agent . The follow group participant receive high dos study drug dose reach unacceptable side effect maximum tolerate dose found , plan high dose level reach side effect .</brief_summary>
