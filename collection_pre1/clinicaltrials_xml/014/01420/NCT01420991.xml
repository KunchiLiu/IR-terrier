	<brief_summary>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) deadly kind stroke . Each year , 40,000 Americans SAH . Case-fatality approach 60 % half die reach hospital . Most commonly , SAH result rupture intracranial aneurysm . Screening high-risk individual could identify great risk decrease devastate effect SAH . Aortic Aneurysm also constitute major public health problem high lethality . Current estimate rupture aortic aneurysm kill 13,000 Americans year . Screening effort effectively lower mortality aortic aneurysm rupture high proportion die diagnosis aortic aneurysm prior rupture . The relationship intracranial aortic aneurysm long recognize , poorly quantify . Recent genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) provide molecular biological evidence share pathophysiology . The chromosome 9p21 locus confers increase risk intracranial aneurysm aortic aneurysm . These GWAS data , along linkage data susceptibility locus , indicate individual family harbor one type aneurysm may especially increase risk . The rationale project opportunistic screen abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) may warrant patient present aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . This study mean see yield screen population low justify routine use . The investigator plan systematically screen AAA case aSAH present MCH treatment . If individual 81 consecutively screened case aSAH evidence AAA , investigator strong confidence le 5 % chance find AAA patient population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Men woman age â‰¥ 18 year . 2 . Diagnosis intracranial aneurysm secure magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) , catheterbased cerebral angiography . 3 . Diagnosis subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnose head CT , brain MRI lumbar puncture . 4 . Provides write informed consent . 5 . No know diagnosis aortic aneurysm 6 . No history prior screen aortic aneurysm 7 . No condition like recent abdominal surgical scar would preclude abdominal ultrasonography 8 . No therapy like abdominal hypothermia pad would preclude abdominal ultrasonography</criteria>
