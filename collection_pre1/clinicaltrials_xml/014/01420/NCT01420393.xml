	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation heart failure two common heart condition associate increase death suffering . When two condition occur patient patient 's prognosis poor . These patient poor life quality frequently admit hospital . The treatment atrial fibrillation heart failure patient extremely challenge . Two option manage atrial fibrillation permit atrial fibrillation continue control heart rate , convert atrial fibrillation rhythm back normal try maintain heart sinus rhythm . Until , method keep patient normal sinus rhythm antiarrhythmic drug . Studies use antiarrhythmic drug control rhythm fail show survival benefit compare permit patient atrial fibrillation . In last year , new development technique technology enable catheter ablation ( cauterization tissue heart catheter ) successful treatment abolish atrial fibrillation approach well antiarrhythmic drug control rhythm . However , long-term study determine whether catheter ablation abolish atrial fibrillation heart failure patient would reduce mortality admission heart failure . This study compare effect catheter ablation-based atrial fibrillation rhythm control rate control patient heart failure high burden atrial fibrillation composite endpoint all-cause mortality hospitalization heart failure define admission health care facility &gt; 24 hour . The investigator also assess cost-effectiveness treatment strategy life quality patient . This study may dramatic impact way investigator manage patient atrial fibrillation heart failure may improve outlook well patient .</brief_summary>
