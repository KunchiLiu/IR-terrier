	<detailed_description>HIV-specific cellular immunity hamper HIV-infected individual , partly virus infects CD4+ T cell , key cell subset immune response . CD4 primary HIV receptor ( CD4 ) , infection require co-receptor ( CCR5 ) carry mainly activate T cell . During primary HIV-infection , two type CD4+ T cell mainly become infected : ( ) Sub-activated T cell specificity within mucosal lining , particularly gut ; ( ii ) HIV-specific T cell clone , proliferates activate normal response HIV infection . The HIV-specific immunity therefore become severely compromise early infection . Patients well T cell specific part HIV Gag matrix protein usually progress slow towards AIDS patient poor T cell responsitivity towards Gag . Therapeutic immunization HIV aim strengthen HIV-specific cellular immunity , usually absence replicate HIV antiretroviral drug . The aim strategy decrease mass latently infect CD4+ T cell , good tolerance drug-free period , good select candidate preventive HIV vaccine . The latter point may important since clinical trial preventive vaccine candidate may challenge ethical standard : Such trial must large conduct poor area high prevalence HIV , order many ( placebo ) ( vaccine candidate ) new HIV infection fast possible . Preventive vaccine trial might therefore compete introduction `` western '' access HIV drug . Vacc-4x one peptide-based therapeutic vaccine test , consist four , slightly modify HIV Gag p24 consensus peptide . Vacc-4x first test intradermal injection use GM-CSF adjuvant . In dose study Hospital , investigator find induction robust cellular immune response vitro vivo skin testing , indication improve viral control , long-lasting immunity lack mutational change HIV strain within study cohort . A recently complete multinational placebo-controlled study find improvement viral load ( presented AIDS vaccine 2011 conference , Bangkok ) . In study investigator hypothesize Vacc-4x peptide , deposit nasal mucosal surface conjunction Endocine , newly develop document mucosal adjuvant , induce T cell response HIV improve HIV-specific immunity systemically mucosal surface ( oral , rectal , vaginal ) . This route application may even simplify mass vaccination . The study primarily dose-study focused adverse event , negligible Vacc-4x give parenterally , well induction systemic mucosal immunity .</detailed_description>
