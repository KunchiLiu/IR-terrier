	<brief_title>Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation ( PFNA ) Versus PFNA Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To avoid pain-causing relative movement implant bone , surgical technique device allow augmentation femoral head recently develop . Biomechanical study show augmentation lead well axial stability pull-out strength . In clinical practice , might facilitate early mobilization full weight-bearing less pain . The purpose study therefore evaluate whether patient trochanteric fracture treat PFNA augmentation well mobilize patient without augmentation . In particular , measure whether patient PFNA Augmentation walk faster non-augmented patient , measure Timed Go test .</detailed_description>
