	<detailed_description>People severe kidney disease follow restrict diet aim reduce intake sodium , potassium phosphate . These dietary restriction require reduce intake many fresh fruit vegetable , may lead nutritional deficiency . Although potential malnutrition people kidney disease well recognize , blood level vitamins trace element rarely measure . Instead , North Americans severe kidney disease routinely prescribe `` renal vitamin '' Replavite contain mixture B C vitamin . Recent evidence ( include work ; see http : //www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/subjects/nephrology ) indicate people severe kidney disease often deficient several biologically essential substance ( selenium , zinc ) readily amenable supplementation . Pilot data Northern Alberta Renal Program ( NARP ) indicate approximately 90 % patient zinc level low limit normal ; finding selenium similar . Potential benefit zinc supplementation include improvement immune function , taste sensitivity ( perhaps reduce dietary sodium intake ) , improve appetite . Potential benefit selenium supplementation include reduction risk vascular disease infection . Supplementation vitamin E show randomized trial reduce serious cardiovascular morbidity people kidney failure , routinely used dialysis patient . This suggest supplementation zinc , selenium , vitamin E theoretical benefit kidney failure . Since patient kidney failure already take many medication , logical combine new nutritional supplement ingredient standard renal vitamin reduce pill burden . This protocol concern novel nutritional supplement consist zinc , selenium vitamin E addition content standard renal supplement B C vitamins . This pilot randomize , double blind trial compare 2 dose new supplement standard renal vitamin . 2.0 Objectives : Primary objective : compare two formulation new supplement ( low medium dose zinc selenium ) standard treatment ( Replavite equivalent renal vitamin ) . Secondary objective : demonstrate feasibility recruitment definitive large trial</detailed_description>
