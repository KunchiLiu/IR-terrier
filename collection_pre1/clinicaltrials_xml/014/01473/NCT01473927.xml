	<brief_summary>Background Determining disease activity IBD sometimes difficult , accurate , require endoscopy . The serum marker CRP proven sufficiently valuable marker IBD specific inflammation . As alternative , far fecal calprotectin appear reliable show certain value predictive marker . Our preliminary data show , serum concentration ficolin-2 significantly high CD patient HBI &gt; 3 . Ficolin-2 lectin acute phase protein produce liver , like MBL , activate lectin pathway complement . Unlike MBL , deficiency ficolin-2 detected patient cohort , could find functional deficiency ficolin-2 ( paper submit ) . Study Aims The study aim substantiate data pilot study show ficolin-2 significantly increased CD patient inflammation . Therefore , study measure ficolin-2 concentration sufficiently large patient group obtain enough statistical power compare result endoscopic disease score ( SES-CD ) CRP calprotectin value . Statistical analysis data show u ficolin-2 reliable easy obtain new marker active inflammation CD . Study Design Based power analysis 112 CD patient 112 UC patient need analyze . They recruit Bern , Basel Lausanne . Only patient routine endoscopy include study score SES-CD . Blood sample collect day endoscopy . Stool sample collect within week endoscopy . Calprotectin CRP concentration determine routine diagnostics , ficolin-2 concentration determine ELISA laboratory . Finally , data statistically analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Background Like mannan-binding lectin ( MBL ) , ficolins important soluble receptor microbial associate molecular pattern lead activation lectin pathway complement . Ficolins structurally related MBL , due different carbohydrate recognition domain represent family lectin ( 1 ) . The single polypeptide chain ficolins form trimer trimer finally form high order structure ( tetramers hexamers ) constitute functional protein . Humans three ficolins : Ficolin-1 ( M-ficolin ) , -2 ( L-ficolin ) -3 ( H-ficolin ) , whereas ficolin-2 -3 present serum , ficolin-1 find surface monocyte . Both , ficolin-2 -3 produce liver additional source ficolin-3 lung . Like MBL , ficolins assemble MBL-associated serin protease ( MASPs ) order activate complement pathway ( 1 ) . In study possible role influence complement system development CD-associated anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody ( ASCAs ) , notice chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( CIBD ) patient , specifically Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patient , exhibit high serum ficolin 2 concentration . Our research group interested interaction innate immune system microorganisms intestinal flora , focus possible defect innate immune mechanism . We ten year experience field , special focus ASCA MBL . We able continuously publish work theory . Our earlier present study role MBL lectin pathway complement CD lead find increase ficolin-2 concentration serum CD patient . Moreover , find CD patient Harvey-Bradshaw index &gt; 3 significantly high ficolin 2 concentration Harvey-Bradshaw index â‰¤ 3 . Study Hypotheses The following hypothesis test : 1 . The ficolin 2 concentration high Crohn 's patient active disease CD patient remission . 2 . Ficolin 2 correlate endoscopic activity . 3 . Ficolin 2 correlate calprotectin . Objective The finding first part study confirm prospective detail study large patient cohort , test ( new ) work hypothesis ficolin 2 represent serum marker disease activity CD . Since currently difficult reliably determine disease activity CD patient use serum stool marker without simultaneous endoscopic examination , another specific easy obtain disease marker correlate well disease activity would highly welcome . Particularly current standard marker , monitor disease activity ( faecal calprotectin ) , much less accepted test parameter blood . Therefore , study aim answer question whether ficolin 2 present great concentration blood Crohn 's patient active inflammation compare CD patient remission ulcerative colitis ( UC ) patient . Methods For purpose study , endoscopic activity index record use SES-CD ( simplify endoscopic score CD ) Crohn 's patient Mayo score colitis patient . Approximately 5 ml blood take prepare serum . ( 5.5 ml 4.9 ml S Monovette 4.7 ml 4.9 ml serum gel Monovette ) . A second test tube blood take CRP determination . In order measure calprotectin , patient ask provide stool sample shortly shortly endoscopic examination ( within one week ) . Serum ficolin value measure enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay ( ELISA ) laboratory Department Clinical Research , University Bern ; value determine routine diagnostic laboratory .</detailed_description>
