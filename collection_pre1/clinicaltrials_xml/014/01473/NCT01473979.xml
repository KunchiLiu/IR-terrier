	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1.1 . Problem surgical site infection sternotomy Sternal osteomyelitis poststernotomy mediastinitis severe life-treating complication cardiac surgery . The incidence sternal osteomyelitis range 1 % 3 % ( 1 , 2 ) high mortality rate 19 % 29 % ( 1 , 3 ) . The devastate complication open sternum laceration right ventricle high mortality . Additionally destabilization thoracic cage , prolonged immobilization , substantial surgical trauma complication conventional strategy ( 4 ) . In addition , postoperative infection sternotomy associate prolonged hospital stay , increase healthcare cost impaired quality patient life , represent economic social burden . The emergence increase antimicrobial resistant bacteria augments importance postsurgical infection since antimicrobial choice become limited . Furthermore , incidence infection indicator quality patient care international benchmark study . Although several therapy strategy nowadays lack evidence base surgical consensus treatment surgical complication . In case poststernotomy mediastinitis involve surgical revision debridement , open dressing , vacuum assist therapy close irrigation . After granulation tissue open chest wound achieve secondary closure and/or reconstruction vascularize soft tissue flap omentum pectoral muscle perform . Both open therapy flap implantation may use single-line therapy combination procedure . 1.2 . Etiology poststernotomy infection Many mechanism propose explain development sternal wound infection . These theory include inadequate sternal fixation lead instability dehiscence overlie skin incision inadequate surgical drainage . Further theory suggest localize ischemic osteomyelitis . This theory suggest sternal wire become loose , leading sternal instability , ultimately lead skin dehiscence osteomyelitic infection . The commonly cultured organism Staphylococcus Aureus . Several retrospective prospective study identify factor relate increase risk sternal dehiscence . Patient risk factor include obesity , diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) , chronic cough tobacco abuse , steroid therapy , hypertension , immunosuppression , advanced age . Operative risk factor include single bilateral internal mammary artery ( IMA ) harvesting ( significantly decrease blood supply ipsilateral hemithorax ) , prolonged operation , excessive hemorrhage , reoperation , break sterile technique , use intra-aortic balloon pump . 2 . Objectives 2.1 . Study hypothesis The optimal treatment sternum osteomyelitis yet define . The aim randomize study compare treatment outcome delay primary closure short-term VAC-therapy ( 48-72 h ) late secondary closure long-term VAC therapy ( &gt; 14 day ) . We hypothesize delayed primary closure well outcome late secondary closure regard parameter : - Cure rate ( &gt; 80 % versus &lt; 60 % ) - Length hospitalization ( ≤6 week versus &gt; 6 week ) - Number surgical intervention ( ≤4 versus &gt; 5 ) - In-hospital mortality ( 5 versus 15 % ) This combined surgical active approach economic advantage compare conventional therapy . 2.2 . Aims Primary 1 . To compare treatment outcome ( hospital stay , morbidity , mortality surgical stress load ) delay primary closure approach late secondary closure Secondary 2 . To evaluate side effect treatment approach , treatment expense . 3 . Study population 3.1 . Ethical aspects The permission local Ethical Committee obtain begin study . This study also register www.ClinicalTrials.gov . Patients enrol randomization 1:1 study arm ; group randomly include 40 patient . The randomization blind perform one principal investigator . In absence principal investigator may perform co-investigators . Surgical procedure arm standardize . In way essential intervention perform main investigator co-investigator . Arm A ) In group patient treat standard surgical treatment . In detail procedure describe 4.4 . Arm B ) I group patient treat accord new concept delay primary sternal closure . The procedure id describe 4.5 . 4 . Procedures method 4.1 . Definition sternal infection Median sternotomy wound complication vary sterile wound dehiscence suppurative mediastinitis . Sternal bone infection , mediastinitis , wound complication , wound infection use synonymously denote deep sternal wound infection . For sake consistency compare data various report , definition sternal wound complication follow ( 8,9,10 ) . Ad 1 ) Mediastinal dehiscence : median sternotomy wind breakdown absence clinical microbiologic evidence infection . Ad 2 ) Mediastinal wound infection : clinical microbiologic evidence infect presternal tissue sternal osteomyelitis , without mediastinal sepsis without unstable sternum . Subtypes include : A ) superficial wound infection : wound infection confine subcutaneous tissue B ) deep wound infection ( mediastinitis ) : wound infection associate sternal osteomyelitis without infected retrosternal space . Deep sternal wound infection , mediastinitis , classify four subtypes base time first presentation , presence absence risk factor , whether previous attempt treat condition fail ( Table 1 ) . Sternal wound infection consider : The definition mediastinitis establish Center Disease Control Prevention USA ( 11 ) . According guideline , diagnosis mediastinitis require least one follow : Ad 1 ) organism isolated culture mediastinal tissue fluid ; Ad 2 ) evidence mediastinitis see operation ; Ad 3 ) one follow condition : chest pain , sternal instability , fever ( &gt; 38 8C ) , combination either purulent discharge mediastinum organism isolate blood culture culture mediastinal drainage . 4.2 . Outline surgical procedure Patients suspect sternal osteomyelitis hospitalize follow diagnostic procedure perform : laboratory blood test ( leukocyte , CRP , creatinin , AST , ALT , CK ) , compute tomography ( CT ) sternum , wound swab . After diagnosis secure patient receive information consent form study . Subsequently randomly include one surgical arm . 4.3 . Current treatment strategy poststernotomy infection During past year , vacuum-assisted closure ( VAC ) wind therapy emerge treatment open septic wound . It non-invasive system help promote wound heal deliver negative pressure application subatmospheric form treatment , several advantageous compare conventional treatment . VAC therapy allow open drainage continuously absorbs exudate simultaneous stabilization chest isolation wound . This therapy induce build granulation tissue majority result reduce oedema increase blood flow adjacent tissue . Furthermore , VAC therapy approximate wound edge provide mass fill effect low degree surgical trauma , without establish new wound ( e.g. , abdominal wound omental flap ) ( 5,6 ) . In recent literature mean hospitalization patient treat VAC therapy 25 ± 20 day overall mortality 15 % . 4.4 . Arm A ) Secondary closure vacuum-assisted system ( VAC ) Nowadays diagnosis poststernotomy wound infection establish clinical procedure obtain follow : firstly empiric antibiotic therapy vancomycin induce . The lab sample include bacteriology test obtain . The initial surgical revision do within 24 hour . Intraoperatively surgical field tissue sample send bacteriology investigation determine antibiotic pattern resistance . All sternal wire remove . Surgical debridement make occurrence tissue bleeding . Careful extensive cleaning wound perform use saline solution 37°C degree Celsius solution 50 % betadine saline solution ( 1:1 Betadine : H20 ) . Finally VAC sponge implant negative suction pressure 75 mmHg . Postoperatively chest X-ray obtain , first 24 hour lab sample CRP whit blood cell count perform . The first revision second look debridement usually make 48 hour . Subsequently follow day wound stepwise revise VAC change ( every 48/72 hour ) sharp spoon necrotic bone remove necessary , extensive sternectomy avoid . At revision tissue sample obtain microbiological investigation . According patient general situation extubated immediately VAC therapy initiation stay intensive care unit 24 hour . The patient obtain 5 7 time surgical procedure time interval 48/72 hour . Subsequently last three bacteriology sample negative delayed primary closure usage Kryptonite biocompatible adhesive glue ( Doctors Research Group Inc , Southbury , CT ) - need sternal stabilization- rectus abdominal muscle flap may do . As far antibiogram know , specific antibiotic therapy induce . 4.5 . Arm B ) Surgical procedure delay primary closure As compare previous therapy modality mention 2.2 1.3 new method advantage surgical wound heal delay primary intention . In first step , diagnosis infection do , empiric antibiotic therapy induce vancomycin first surgical intervention sternal wire remove , mediastinum explore extensive surgical debridement perform occurrence tissue bleeding . Careful extensive cleaning wound perform use saline solution 37°C degree Celsius solution 50 % betadine saline solution ( 1:1 Betadine : H20 ) , least 3 sample ( tissue biopsy ) take microbiology . The patient receive treatment deliver VAC system first 48 hour follow first surgical intervention . Subsequently wound close . We begin dissection elevation pectoralis major muscle correspond subcutaneous flap diathermy . Dissection perform median line along costal grid , two third anterior chest wall , preserve humeral insertion , thoracoacromial vascular bundle pectoralis minor muscle . Note area important vascular connection area internal thoracic artery , acromial artery lateral thoracic artery preserve . At inferior plane , pectoralis major muscle raise - include anterior rectus fascia - xiphoid process . The upper segment anterior rectum raise pectoralis major muscle . The intercostal perforating arterial branch preserve also . A silicon drain tube place retrosternal space possible . In patient fracture asymmetry sternum incision , osteosynthesis perform use `` Robiscek '' technique . Then two suction drain place muscular plane upon costal grid drainage large area detachment musculoaponeurotic layer The suture pectoral fascia tension free , continuous suture resorbable material ( Vicryl 3-0 ) . The subcutaneous tissue close drainage , separate subcutaneous suture . The skin close non-resorbable suture analog `` Allgöver '' suture . These suture remove 12 14 postoperative day . Thus result bacteriology known case first 48 hour specific antibiotic therapy , accord result bacteriology result may introduce . 4.6 General consideration Contraindication closure chest : Wounds active purulence require extensive debridement prior flap coverage and/or rigid fixation . Additional contraindication sternal reconstruction find patient unstable surgery , include poor pulmonary function , poor cardiac reserve , terminal illness . Hemodynamic stability require surgical intervention patient sternal dehiscence . 4.7 . Early perioperative management 48 hour Transfer ICU : After definitive sternal closure patient transfer ICU hemodynamical observation first 24 hour . Beside following consider indication transfer ICU . : Preoperative sepsis , intraoperative hemodynamical instability or/and need catecholamine , intraoperative need massive transfusion , rupture ventricular cavity ( left right ) , need emergency cardiopulmonary bypass . Transfer intermediate car Hemodynamical pulmonary stable patient extubated operating room , transfer intermediate care unit department cardiovascular surgery . General consideration Independently investigation group Arm A ) Arm B ) postoperatively X-ray thorax obtain transfer . In first 24 hour , lab sample obtain ( CRP , anticoagulation , white blood cell cont , hemoglobin , hematocrit , ASAT , ALAT , yGT , Creatinine , Urea , anticoagulation test PTT , TP ) . Respiratory physiotherapy obtain 24 hour surgical revision . Open chest patient mobilize bed , however chest elevation mobilization 45 90° aloud . After definitive closure chest patient may fully mobilize first 48 hour , transfer ward .</detailed_description>
