	<brief_title>ExAblate ( Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery ) Treatment Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although initial treatment malignant glioma well establish , best treatment progressive disease remain undefined . Patients newly diagnose glioma typically treat surgery follow conformal radiation concomitant chemotherapy . Even though tumor curable , prolonged survival achieve selected patient . Despite improved multimodal therapy , almost patient experience recurrence site primary tumor already receive maximal surgical resection radiation therapy . Typically , patient life expectancy approximately 6 month , less third patient alive one year . Salvage therapy patient usually take form various systemic chemotherapeutic agent localized therapy reirradiation may possible previously irradiate site . As progressive disease poor response rate current systemic therapy , effort define role novel local therapy , MR guide focus ultrasound ( MRgFUS ) , necessary . There local therapy option progressive glioma . Traditionally , reirradiation surgery consider last resort treatment symptomatic recurrence . In initial treatment glioma , tumor surround brain receive near tolerance dos usually preclude second course radiation therapy . If clinically advisable feasible , second operation may undertake usually reserve young patient good neurological status develop neurological symptom related mass effect tumor . The use MR guide focus ultrasound represent new , noninvasive therapeutic option overcomes limitation secondary surgery reirradiation provide patient option local ablative therapy . The lesioning tumor do accurately MRI guidance real-time monitoring ablative ultrasonic hyperthermia . As cytotoxic affect due hyperthermia , cumulative radiation affect limit use radiotherapy recurrent disease . The potential benefit patient include local control disease/tumor , prolong time subsequent salvage therapy . A similar situation exist brain metastasis . Historically , development brain metastasis consider terminal event , however , good local therapy well systemic therapy , patient live longer . Initial management patient brain metastasis usually involve surgery , whole brain radiation , radiosurgery combination modality depend clinical situation . The goal treat brain metastasis prevent patient succumb CNS disease . As improved systemic therapy lengthen survival patient metastatic tumor , patient survive develop recurrent progressive metastatic CNS disease . Progressive disease usually require local therapy chemotherapeutic agent adequately cross blood brain barrier large impact CNS metastases . MRIgFUS could play important role ablate brain metastasis patient already maximally radiate otherwise without option .</detailed_description>
