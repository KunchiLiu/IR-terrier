	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give together gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient stage III-IV recurrent pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
