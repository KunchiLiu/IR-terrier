	<brief_summary>Although causal factor allergy development allergen exposure environmental pollution decrease recent year , incidence allergic disease increase Western world . Since genetic predisposition develop allergy change short time conceivable , instead emerge new unknown risk factor , protective factor seem disappear Western world . Allergic disease tendency develop allergy allergens surround environment . The common symptom eczema food allergy early life , bronchial asthma ( AB ) later childhood allergic rhino conjunctivitis ( ARC ) school age adolescence , so-called allergic march . Some person may develop one , others symptoms . Inheritance , environment allergen exposure important factor affect march important factor predict later development disease . Sensitization egg ( positive skin prick test specific IgE egg serum ) combine skin problem infancy predispose strongly development allergic asthma later life . The purpose work supply child early development IgE associate eczema food allergy omega-3 LCPUFA age 12 month assess effect supplementation future development skin symptom , food allergy , sensitisation inhalant allergens asthma child . We also assess immunological marker Th2-skewed immunity relation clinical effect supplementation . Families child younger 12 month refer paediatric department Linköping University Hospital , Motala , Norrköping Jönköping Hospitals South East Sweden , diagnosis IgE associate eczema sensitise food allergen ( egg , milk , wheat and/or soya ) invite participate study . Clinical examination paediatrician assessment disease severity SCORAD perform research nurse inclusion . The child assess every six month nurse 2.5 year age paediatrician 3 year age . Later clinical assessment perform yearly age 7 .</brief_summary>
