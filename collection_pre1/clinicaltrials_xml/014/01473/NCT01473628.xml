	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn add rituximab radiation therapy help control disease good radiation alone . The safety combination also study . Radiation therapy design kill cancer cell stop cancer cell grow . Rituximab design attach cancer cell CD20 ( tumor marker ) surface damage , may cause cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Radiation Therapy With Without Rituximab Patients With Stage I II Follicular Lymphoma Grade I/II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance either group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . - If Group 1 , receive radiation alone . - If Group 2 , receive radiation rituximab . Radiation Therapy Study Drug Administration : You receive radiation therapy 5 day week 2 Â½ week ( 12 treatment ) . You receive separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . If Group 2 , receive rituximab every week 4 week , begin start radiation therapy . You receive rituximab vein 4-6 hour . After radiation therapy , continue receive rituximab every 2 month total 4 dos . Study Visits During Radiation Therapy : Every week radiation therapy : - You ask drug may take . - You ask feel side effect may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam . Study Visits After Completing Radiation Therapy : Every two month total 4 dos ( rituximab-only therapy ) : - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement height weight . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask feel side effect may . Rituximab receive outside MD Anderson long outside doctor give drug way . Routine Follow-up : You also routine follow-up visit every 3 month first 2 follow-up visit , every 6 month first 2 year , year year 3 5 every 2 year year 5 15 . At visit , follow test procedure record : - Your skin lesion photograph . - You ask drug may take . - You ask feel side effect may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You PET scan check status disease . - You CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis . End-of-Study Drug Visits : If leave study early : - Your skin lesion photograph . - You ask drug may take . - You ask feel side effect may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You PET scan check status disease . - You CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis . Every 3 month 2 year : - You ask drug may take . - You ask feel side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Length Study : You continue treatment 4 dos rituximab and/or 15 radiation treatment . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You study 15 year . This investigational study . Radiation rituximab FDA approve commercially available patient lymphoma . Up 130 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
