	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , ganitumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether give one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) effective without ganitumab treat patient pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study best dose combination chemotherapy ganitumab well combination chemotherapy without ganitumab work treat patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Ganitumab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess safety determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) modify FOLFIRINOX ( mFOLFIRINOX ) ganitumab patient previously untreated , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . ( phase I ) - To compare overall survival patient previously untreated , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo . ( phase II ) - To assess convergent validity select PRO-CTCAE item compare item baseline patient ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 v 1 . ( phase II ) Secondary - To compare objective response rate , duration response , progression-free survival patient previously untreated , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo . - To compare treatment-related toxicity patient previously untreated , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive mFOLFIRINOX plus ganitumab versus mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo . - To assess responsiveness ( sensitivity change ) Patient-Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) -CTCAE compare change score within group patient define change ECOG PS post-baseline administration . ( phase II ) - To compare maximum post-baseline score PRO-CTCAE item per patient arm randomize phase II component study . ( exploratory ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , phase IB study follow randomized phase II study . Patients phase II study stratify accord ECOG performance status 0 versus 1 . - Phase IB : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 48 hour begin day 2 ( mFOLFIRINOX ) . After cohort 0 , subsequent patient also receive ganitumab IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Phase II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : - Arm I : Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX Phase IB ganitumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX Phase IB placebo IV 30-60 minute day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients randomize phase II component study may complete 16 Patient-Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) -CTCAE item ( measure 8 symptom ) paper day 1 odd-numbered course ( i.e. , course 1 , 3 , 5 , etc. ) . Tumor tissue blood sample may collect correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
