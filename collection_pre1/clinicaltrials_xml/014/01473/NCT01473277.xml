	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Type A ( BT-A ) Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain Versus Steroid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain one common complication stroke . In fact , occur 70 % stroke victim . Post-stroke shoulder pain impact negatively daily activity . Moreover , interfere rehabilitation process , relate poor quality life associate bad outcome prolong hospitalization.The aetiology post-stroke HSP uncertain , although associate various factor : joint disorder , capsulitis adhesive , subluxation head humerus , rotator cuff tendon injury spasticity surround muscle . Clinicians use wide variety approach treat post-stroke HSP , although none yet proven effective . Correct position careful handle hemiplegic limb believe prevent HSP . Physiotherapy alone seem effective complication . Capsulitis adhesive successfully treat corticosteroid injection shoulder . However , despite many randomize controlled trial corticosteroid injection shoulder pain , effect remain controversial . The large number intervention lack consensus effectiveness suggest aetiology poorly understood hence treatment remain establish . Intramuscular injection botulinum toxin type A ( BT-A ) also demonstrate reduce HSP . The mechanism whereby intramuscular inoculation BT-A reduces pain may include muscle relaxant effect inhibition release neurotransmitter sensory neuron . Nevertheless , approach limitation : probably effective muscular articular pain may influence muscle affect site injection . Intra-articular injection BT-A recently prove safe effective treatment refractory joint shoulder pain cause chronic arthritis . The mechanisms exerts effect know , could include inhibition release pain peptide nerve terminal sensory ganglion , anti-inflammatory anti-glutaminergic effect .</detailed_description>
