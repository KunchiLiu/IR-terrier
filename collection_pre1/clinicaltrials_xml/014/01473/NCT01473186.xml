	<brief_summary>Objectives : Given profound impact obesity genesis endometrial cancer , study proposes prospectively evaluate baseline prevalence menstrual irregularity endometrial pathology morbidly obese woman discover risk stratification marker potentially identify high risk woman might benefit targeted cancer prevention strategies future clinical trial . - Specific Aim 1 : To assess prevalence menstrual irregularity correlate gynecologic menstrual history perceive personal risk severity gynecologic cancer population female bariatric surgery candidate . - Specific Aim 2 : To determine prevalence endometrial hyperplasia cancer morbidly obese woman undergo bariatric surgery . - Specific Aim 3 : To obtain adipose , endometrium , blood sample ( ) bariatric surgery ass baseline hormone level adipocyte-derived factor correlate presence menstrual irregularity , endometrial hyperplasia cancer , postsurgical weight change . Methods : - Specific Aim 1 : After inform consent obtain , survey medical history prospective bariatric surgery patient perform University Virginia . - Specific Aim 2 : For woman undergo bariatric surgery , study investigator perform endometrial biopsy time bariatric surgery participant determine status endometrial line potential presence endometrial cancer precursor . - Specific Aim 3 : At time surgery , blood , adipose , endometrial tissue sample collect evaluation adipocyte-related factor correlation clinical endpoint . Blood also collect 6 12 month surgery . Anticipated result : This study identify prevalence correlation menstrual irregularity endometrial abnormality cancer morbidly obese woman well define perceive risk develop cancer . Serum biomarkers obese woman without endometrial cancer/precancer would evaluate correlation potential applicability endometrial cancer screen high-risk population . Most importantly , study may provide evidence whether screen ( via endometrial biopsy serum marker ) warrant asymptomatic , morbidly obese woman suggest potential preventive risk reduction mechanism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity define qualitatively World Health Organization , `` abnormal excessive fat accumulation may impair health . Obesity estimate lead 280,000 deaths year U.S. , make second common cause preventable death behind tobacco [ 1 ] . Obesity lead increase risk several cancer , notably endometrial cancer fourth common U.S. cancer 40,000 affected woman account 6 % estimate cancer 2008 [ 2 ] . The recent increase endometrial cancer parallel increase obesity [ 3 ] . The relative risk obese woman develop endometrial cancer increase proportionally increase body mass index ( BMI - weight kilogram divide height meter square ) [ 4 ] . The risk may 2-3 time [ 12,13 ] 10-times great woman 50 pound overweight [ 5 ] . The recent cohort study Norway demonstrate increase adjusted relative risk base BMI 4.28 BMI 35-39 6.36 BMI 40 [ 6 ] . Morbidly obese woman also 23 fold likely harbor precancerous endometrial condition compare normal weight woman [ 7 ] The link obesity endometrial cancer well-established 20 year [ 5 , 8 ] . For common histological subtype ( endometrioid adenocarcinoma ) , development endometrial cancer stimulate presence estrogen . In obese patient , adipose tissue responsible elevate endogenous estrogen level conversion androgens estrogens [ 9 ] . This also result relative decrease progesterone , normally 'protects ' uterine line over-stimulation estrogen [ 8 ] . Obesity impact multiple factor include adiponectin , leptin , insulin , insulin growth factor one ( IGF-1 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , aromatase , peroxisome proliferator activate receptor γ ( PPAR ) potential link factor carcinogenesis yet elucidate . Propelled increase obesity , interest identifying risk population might benefit screen and/or prevention . Viola et al look prevalence endometrial cancer precursor biopsying 193 asymptomatic pre- post-menopausal obese woman ( average BMI 35.5 37.6 respectively ) find prevalence endometrial hyperplasia cancer 5.8 % 1 % premenopausal woman 12.1 % 3 % postmenopausal woman [ 10 ] . These rate may even higher symptomatic woman . For example , Schmeler et al evaluate 188 woman diagnose endometrial cancer age 50 , 61 % obese woman report irregular menses , 14 % history infertility , 35 % diabetes [ 11 ] . The advantage diagnose endometrial cancer precursor lesion early stage due dramatic survival benefit ; woman stage 1 disease excellent 5 year survival rate range 80-95 % survival drop dramatically stage increase . Women earlier-stage disease generally need less-invasive less-morbid post-operative treatment . Universal screen woman endometrial cancer currently recommend [ 12 , 13 ] . However , trend endometrial cancer find young , obese woman , increase likelihood screening could decrease morbidity mortality preventative strategy could implement high risk woman . Kwon Lu conduct cost-effectiveness analysis compare screening ( standard care ) , oral contraceptive pill prevention , endometrial biopsy either yearly every year age 30 . They conclude risk endometrial cancer high risk population need 13 time general population even warrant use oral contraceptive preventive measure [ 13 ] . Another cost analysis study confirm endometrial cancer screen warrant general population high risk population , annual serum screen might efficacious cost effective [ 12 ] . To date , serum screen marker available endometrial cancer . Prior author demonstrate low adiponectin level correlate increase rate endometrial cancer . Adiponectin activate AMPK pathway PPAR alpha pathway two different receptor function increase insulin sensitivity decrease inflammation . Further prospective evaluation adiponectin potential biomarkers warrant population correlate obesity weight loss [ 14-21 ] . Given prevalence obesity continue increase age time diagnosis endometrial cancer also begin decrease , early identification cancer pre-cancerous change uterus become important way decrease morbidity mortality ever-growing population obese woman [ 22 , 23 ] . A previous retrospective study woman undergo bariatric surgery UVA demonstrate endometrial cancer one common cancer diagnose morbidly obese population , woman diagnose bariatric surgery average age 35 BMI 65 kg/m2 [ 24 ] . Yet currently , pre-operative gynecologic evaluation bariatric surgery weight loss include mammogram ( screen breast cancer ) Pap smear ( cervical cancer ) compliance recommendation well document . Given profound impact obesity genesis endometrial cancer , study proposes prospectively evaluate baseline prevalence menstrual irregularity endometrial pathology morbidly obese woman present evaluation bariatric weight loss surgery . The bariatric surgery population ideal define baseline characteristic population , assess prevalence endometrial abnormality determine difference hormone adipocyte derive marker woman without endometrial abnormality assess impact weight loss marker . Ultimately , study may allow identification risk stratification marker potentially identify woman might benefit targeted cancer prevention strategies future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
