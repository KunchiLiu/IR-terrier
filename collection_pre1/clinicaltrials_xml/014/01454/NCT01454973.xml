Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test . 3 . Women childbearing potential allow ( must agree use nonhormonal contraception plan become pregnant duration study . Must agree maintain contraceptive measure throughout study . Acceptable contraceptive method female subject childbearing potential include one following : Abstinence . One ( 1 ) follow method : Tubal ligation Coppercontaining intrauterine device ( IUD ) Condom AND spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Male partner vasectomy least 6 month . 4 . It require male subject use acceptable method contraception ( outline ) , start first dose study medication continue least 28 day last dose study drug : Abstinence A condom AND one following : Vasectomy 6 month . Female partner meet one follow condition : tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy ; post menopausal 5 . BMI 2740 ; stable weight ( le 3 % change past 3 month ) Age Range : 3065 6 . No history diabetes mellitus impaired glucose tolerance ( impaired fasting glucose ) 7 . Other condition may allow , medically stable control within acceptable limit , include : hypertension , dyslipidemia , osteoarthritis , osteoporosis 8 . Smokers allow , must able participate inpatient stay smoke 9 . Normal oral glucose tolerance test response ( see exclusion criterion ) Subjects present follow include study : 1 . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic clinical finding Screening . 2 . Any condition possibly affect absorption ( eg , gastrectomy , malabsorption syndrome , abdominal surgery appendectomy , cholecystectomy hysterectomy ) . 3 . Use unacceptable medication ( see Appendix A ) 4 . A positive urine drug screen . 5 . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week female 14 drinks/week men ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . 6 . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives precede first dose study medication . 7 . 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec Screening male , 470 msec female . If QTc exceed 450/470 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc value use determine subject 's eligibility . 8 . Supine blood pressure &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , single measurement . If elevate , confirm single repeat , follow least 10 minute rest . 9 . Screening fast serum glucose &gt; =100 mg/dL HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % , confirm single repeat deem necessary . 10 . Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test ( see definition abnormal ) . 11 . Screening serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) great 2X upper limit laboratory reference range . 12 . Elevated fast triglyceride screen ( &gt; 500 mg/dL ) , confirm single repeat deem necessary . 13 . Pregnant nursing female ; inability use effective contraception . 14 . Blood donation approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . 15 . Participation clinical biomedical research study within prior two month may exclude , depend study type detail . 16 . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia , utilized site blood draw . 17 . Unwilling unable comply direction procedure describe protocol . 18 . Subject Investigator subInvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff , relative study personnel directly involve conduct study . 19 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
