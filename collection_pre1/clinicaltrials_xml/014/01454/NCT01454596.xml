	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient gliomas involves take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-EGFRvIII incorporated retrovirus . Objective : The purpose study determine safe number cell infuse see particular tumor-fighting cell ( anti-EGFRvIII cell ) safe effective treatment advance glioma . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 malignant glioma express EGFRvIII molecule . Design : Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti-EGFRvIII cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-EGFRvIII cell , aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every month first year , every 1-2 month long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting EGFRvIII Patients With Malignant Gliomas Expressing EGFRvIII</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Patients recurrent gliomas limited treatment option . EGFR variant III ( EGFRvIII ) common mutant variant EGFR present 24-67 % patient glioblastoma . - EGFRvIII expression promotes oncogenesis associate poor prognosis . - EGFRvIII express normal tissue attractive target immunotherapy . - We construct retroviral vector contain chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) recognize EGFRvIII tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer CAR high efficiency without need perform selection . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives - To evaluate safety administration anti-EGFRvIII CAR engineer peripheral blood lymphocytes patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , aldesleukin - Determine six month progression free survival patient receive anti-EGFRvIII CAR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . Secondary objective - Determine vivo survival CAR gene-engineered cell . - Evaluate radiographic change treatment ELIGIBILITY : - Histologically proven glioblastoma gliosarcoma express EGFRvIII determine IHC RT-PCR - Failed prior standard treatment radiotherapy without chemotherapy - Karnofsky score great equal 60 % - Cardiac , pulmonary laboratory parameter within acceptable limit DESIGN : - The study conduct use Phase I/II design . - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , CAR gene-transduced PBMC , plus IV aldesleukin . - Once MTD determine , study proceed phase II portion . - In phase 2 portion trial , patient accrue two group : - Patients recurrent malignant glioma require steroid use start treatment - Patients recurrent malignant glioma require steroid start treatment - A total 107 patient may enrol period 7 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients histologically proven glioblastomas gliosarcomas express EGFRvIII assess IHC PCR . 2 . Patients must progression disease radiotherapy ( include patient undergo surgery recurrent disease render NED ) . This include recurrent GBM receive standard firstline treatment , include surgery ( feasible due neurosurgical neuroanatomical consideration ) adjuvant radiotherapy +/ chemotherapy . 3 . Patients must either receive steroid , stable dose steroid least five day prior registration . 4 . Patients must &gt; 18 year old less equal age 70 , must life expectancy &gt; 8 week 5 . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent Document 6 . Must willing sign durable power attorney . 7 . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 8 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control four month follow treatment . 9 . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 10 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 11 . Hematology WBC great equal 3000/mm ( 3 ) ANC great equal 1000/mm ( 3 ) without support filgrastim Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin great equal 8.0 g/dl ( eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion ) 12 . Chemistry : ALT/AST le equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 13 . Patients must least 4 week radiation therapy . Additionally , patient must least 6 week nitrosoureas , 4 week temozolomide , 3 week procarbazine , 2 week vincristine 4 week last bevacizumab administration . Patients must least 4 week cytotoxic therapy list 2 week noncytotoxic agent ( e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen ) include investigative agent . All toxicity prior therapy resolve CTCAE less equal grade 1 ( except toxicity alopecia , vitiligo ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . A prior history gliadel implantation past six months.. 2 . Women currently pregnant breast feeding potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 3 .
