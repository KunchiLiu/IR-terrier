	<detailed_description>Understanding molecular basis cancer critical step toward devise effective treatment patient individual . The promise molecular target therapeutic personalized cancer care demonstrate breast lung cancer chronic myeloid leukemia . However , similar example success multiple myeloma achieve despite extensive basic research well clinical advance . What well understood myeloma heterogeneous disease great genetic epigenetic complexity.22 , 23 Therefore , remain critical need understand myeloma patient biology context current patient care.24 The objective longitudinal study identify patient subgroup phenotype define molecular profile clinical feature . These profile enable good understand mechanisms disease , drug response patient relapse . Ultimately study intend drive successful drug development patient care multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
