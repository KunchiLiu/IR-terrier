	<brief_summary>Although instrument pedometer heart rate monitor helpful use exercise maintain weight , actually measure calorie expend , critical piece information necessary sustain weight management . The purpose study determine accuracy new device measure calorie burn base upon heat produce body . Since heat production directly proportional calorie burn , device potential accurately measure energy expend many different setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Free-living Energy Expenditure Using Direct Calorimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current approach measure total daily energy expenditure ( TDEE ) free-living individual limit cost , accuracy , lack sensitivity specific activity . Accurate , reliable , low cost approach measure TDEE need improve clinical outcome ( e.g . weight management ) , also meet public health research objective . In human , EE proportional total heat loss , sum conductive , convective , radiant evaporative heat flow , measurement heat loss basis direct calorimetry . However , possible accurately measure form heat flux free-living human , particularly evaporative heat loss , substantial component total heat production . A recently develop heat flow gauge capacity measure form heat flux show promise proof concept trial pilot study , accuracy measure TDEE yet thoroughly test . Moreover , accuracy affect factor clothing , ambient temperature , adiposity study . The objective propose research ) refine measurement TDEE base total heat flux determine factor clothing , ambient temperature , age , sex , body composition influence accuracy ; b ) compare accuracy approach criterion measurement Doubly Labeled Water ( DLW ) whole-room indirect calorimetry ; c ) compare accuracy similar instrument measure heat flux , capable directly measure evaporative component . The propose research innovative test accuracy approach base physiological signal ( heat production ) directly proportional EE . In addition accurately measure TDEE , identify distinguish different type physical activity important goal physical activity relate research , capacity limit . Thus , additional goal propose research determine measurement change heat flux use identify EE specific bout activity differentiate upper body low body activity . The proposed study permit refinement technology major impact clinical practice research . This new approach potentially provide substantive improvement measurement TDEE free-living human assessment physical activity associate energy cost .</detailed_description>
