	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To develop test intervention promote farmer ' use hearing protection device ( HPDs ) . SPECIFIC AIMS : The specific aim study contrast effect three alternative NIHL-prevention intervention strategy , deliver various combination HPD use use-related attitudes/beliefs . Specifically , three approach include : ) interactive , predictors-based intervention deliver via Internet ( `` Interactive Web , '' IWI ) ; b ) static informational Web site design increase farmer ' use HPDs ( `` Static Web , '' SWI ) ; c ) sampler HPDs , e.g. , ear muff , plug ( `` HPD Intervention , '' HPD I ) . HYPOTHESIS 1 : Participants receive interactive Web intervention ( IWI ) high hear protector device ( HPD ) use favorable use-related attitudes/beliefs participant receive interactive web intervention ( IWI ) ; HYPOTHESIS 2 : Participants receive HPD intervention ( HPDI ) high HPD use positive use-related attitudes/beliefs participant receive HPD intervention ( HPDI ) . HYPOTHESIS 3 : Participants visit Web site frequently high HPD use visit less frequently . HYPOTHESIS 4 . There interaction intervention delivery mode ( interactive vs. static ) HPDI . BACKGROUND : Farmers among noise-exposed group worker , experience rate noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) 72 % compare worker industry ( x % ) . NIHL associate negative impact quality life , include difficulty communication , risk hearing warn sound , tinnitus . Although use hearing protection device ( HPDs ) would protect NIHL , use among farmer low . An early study identify predictor use HPDs barrier , situational factor gender , account 74 % variance use . These result also show small proportion farmer successfully develop variety method overcome barrier situational factor interfere HPD use . This project build early work apply finding develop target intervention also incorporate videotaped message actual farmer frequent user HPDs . METHODS : The intervention , base Pender Health Promotion Model , consist Internet-based brief interactive motivational package regard adopt HPD use behavior . Outcome measure include self-reported frequency HPD use , measure 6 12 month post-intervention . The study involve six experimental condition . In first condition , farmer receive interactive Web intervention ( IWI ) assortment hear protection device ( HPDs ) ; second condition , farmer receive interactive Web intervention ( IWI ) ; third condition , farmer receive static Web intervention ( SWI ) HPDs ; fourth condition , farmer receive static Web intervention ( SWI ) ; fifth condition , farmer receive assortment HPDs . A sixth condition deliver interactive Web intervention farmer enroll target 709 enrollee , receive service courtesy American Farm Bureau affiliate , case 710 beyond receive incentive .</detailed_description>
