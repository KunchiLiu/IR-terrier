The present study aim extend line research employ stringent control group test efficacy three session CCT two-week period community population depress mood . Forty-eight participant high BDI-II score randomize CCT comparison condition ( Peripheral Vision Training ; PVT ) . The investigator hypothesize relative control condition ( PVT ) , CCT would associate less self-reported negative mood emotional reactivity .</brief_summary>
