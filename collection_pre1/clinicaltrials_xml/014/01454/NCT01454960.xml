The participant practice attend physician advanced practice nurse ( i.e . provider ) participate clinic see acute respiratory infection patient . A maximum 550 participant recruit study . Providers consent participate fill baseline questionnaire online . Subsequent baseline data collection enrollment , participate clinic site randomize study arm , describe . There control arm , clinic site randomize multifactorial design three intervention leverage electronic medical record : Order Sets trigger EHR workflow contain exclusively guideline concordant choice ( SA , Suggested Alternatives ) ; Accountable Justification ( AJ ) trigger discordant prescription populate note provider 's rationale guideline exception ; performance feedback benchmarks provider ' performance peer ( PC , Peer Comparison ) . The outcomes interest antibiotic prescribing pattern , include prescribe rate change prescribe rate time .
