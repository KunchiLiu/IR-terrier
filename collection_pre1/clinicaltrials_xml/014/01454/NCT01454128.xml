	<brief_title>The Role Exercise-Periodic-Breathing ( EPB ) Impaired Ventilation Regulation Dysfunction Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients heart failure display dyspnea exertion , low PCO2 high ventilatory response exercise ( V E -V CO 2slope ) , demonstrate dysregulation breathe disease category . Some patient develop ventilation dysregulation pattern ventilatory oscillation compose exercise periodic breathing ( EPB ) sleep apnea . Previous study reveal ventilatory oscillation associate cyclic change arterial oxygen ( PO2 ) carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) tension , also associate severely impaired exercise tolerance , steep V E -V CO 2slope , low peak O 2 consumption , correlate bad severity heart failure adverse prognosis . The origin ventilatory oscillation might involve instability ventilator control system , compose prolonged circulatory delay , abnormal peripheral ergoreﬂex activation peripheral chemo- baro-sensitivity , even abnormal autonomic reﬂexes alter central command . However , study investigate response via sleep apnea rest status especially brain . The real-time change response exercise limit ventilatory parameter oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide production . Whether exercise periodic breathe response exercise lead abnormal cerebral hemodynamic response exercise HF remain unclear . Impaired cerebral blood flow demonstrate apnetic episode related neuropsychological deficit sleep apnea patient . To control key feedback mechanism , impaired cerebral blood flow exercise EPB patient could speculate . Moreover , Cerebral hypo-perfusion response exercise may contribute impairment functional capacity patient HF . Accordingly , hypothesize abnormal cerebral hemodynamics exercise periodic breathing exercise associate decline functional capacity patient HF . Besides , Physical train beneficial effect effectively counteract progression deleterious compensatory mechanism HF . Whether exercise yield beneficial effect ventilation oscillation inefficacy clear . We observe real-time cardiac hemodynamic change respond exercise periodic breathing change . We expect result obtain study aid determine appropriate exercise intervention improve aerobic fitness well simultaneously improve hemodynamic control patient HF . A quasi-experimental design use investigation . Sixty HF patient recruit Chang Gung Medical Foundation , Keelung Branch provide informed consent . These subject divide PB ( n=30 ) non-PB group ( n=30 ) expression CPET . Patients group receive therapy trace course 2years include CV clinic , CPET polysomnography . We measure subject ' physical fitness , oxygen transport utilization exercise skeletal muscle , cardiovascular function hemodynamics , blood cell parameter , RBC deformity aggregation , plasma biomarkers myocardial damage , oxygen stress quality life pre-training stage follow 6th , 12th , 18th , 24th month trace program . Experimental result analyze descriptive statistic ( percentage , mean , standard deviation ) , independent t-test , repeat measure ANOVA . We study parameter realize physiological response exercise patient discover appropriate exercise intensity prescription EPB . This study employ simultaneously noninvasive , bio-reactance device ( i.e. , noninvasive continuous CO monitoring system , NICOM ) ass cardiac hemodynamics , near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor change cerebral muscular perfusion/oxygenation . We elucidate real-time adaption ventilator parameter hemodynamic one ventilation oscillation patient HF .</detailed_description>
