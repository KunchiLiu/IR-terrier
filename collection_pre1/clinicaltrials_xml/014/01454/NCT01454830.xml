Intervention study promote CPAP adherence show relatively small effect select sample costly . The overall objective research examine effect , feasibility , acceptability tailor intervention CPAP adherence among adults newly-diagnosed , CPAP treat OSA . The central hypothesis critically time tailored intervention focus sociocultural aspect cognitive perception individual experience OSA diagnosis treatment improve overall CPAP adherence rate . The pilot randomize controlled trial examine CPAP adherence outcomes 1wk , 1mo , 3mo among randomly assign tailor intervention usual ( standard ) care examine specific feasibility participant acceptability outcome order design conduct subsequent large randomize control trial test overall efficacy tailor intervention .</detailed_description>
