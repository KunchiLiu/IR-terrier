	<brief_summary>Probiotics live microbe , administer sufficient amount , confer health benefit host . According recent clinical trial , administration probiotic low birth weight infant significantly reduce overall mortality risk necrotizing enterocolitis , devastate inflammatory intestinal disease . The investigator previously demonstrate administer probiotic lactate mother enhances immunoprotective property breast milk . Despite promising data , optimal probiotic intervention yet establish . The mechanisms probiotic exert effect remain largely unknown . This research project base notion modulation early microbial contact probiotic may provide safe effective mean improve health preterm infant . In particular , investigator hypothesize protective potential probiotic may enhance via breast milk administer probiotic lactate mother . All potentially beneficial effect probiotic bacteria strain-specific therefore preliminary laboratory clinical research regard different physiological target probiotic intervention carry guide design large-scale clinical trial aim show clinical efficacy establish clinical practice . The purpose research project identify target probiotic therapy premature neonate provide insight optimal probiotic strain administration protocol clinical efficacy subsequently test randomize control trial . The specific aim project : 1 . To determine effect maternal consumption probiotic lactation immunomodulatory property breast milk mother premature infant . Concentrations immunomodulatory factor microbiological property breast milk measure . 2 . To investigate impact different probiotic administration protocol gut microbiota composition preterm infant . In particular , issue whether maternal probiotic consumption instead addition probiotic administer infant effective elucidate . Different potential probiotic strain assess . 3 . To elucidate impact probiotic bacteria administer lactate mother and/or directly infant gut immunophysiology preterm infant .</brief_summary>
