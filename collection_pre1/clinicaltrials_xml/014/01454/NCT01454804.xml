	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination pazopanib either lapatinib trastuzumab give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Pazopanib design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient need tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Lapatinib design prevent slow growth cancer cell block 2 protein surface cancer cell , HER 1 HER 2 receptor . Trastuzumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell , call Her2/neu receptor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , doctor decide study drug receive base disease type drug take past You receive either combination pazopanib lapatinib ( Arm A ) combination pazopanib trastuzumab ( Arm B ) . Up 5 dose level combination test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level combination . The first group participant receive low dose level combination . Each new group ( ) receive high combination group , intolerable side effect see . Participants may enrol 1-3 similar dose level time . You assign dose level base join study . This continue high tolerable dose ( ) study drug combination find . The dose study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Once high tolerable dos different combination find , dose combination give expansion group 20 extra participant . Study Drug Administration : If Arm A , take lapatinib mouth 1 time day . You take pazopanib mouth 1 time every day ( Day 1 , 3 , 5 , ) . You take pazopanib lapatinib either 1 hour 2 hour eat meal . If Arm B , take pazopanib mouth 1 time day . You receive trastuzumab vein Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle . The first infusion 90 minute . If handle infusion well , next infusion 30 minute . You take pazopanib either 1 hour 2 hour eat meal . Each study cycle 28 day . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . Week 3 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . During Week 3 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 4 Cycle 2 every 2-3 cycle : - You CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or x-ray check status disease . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad , continue intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET scan check status disease . This investigational study . Pazopanib FDA approve commercially available treatment renal cell carcinoma . Lapatinib trastuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . The combination pazopanib lapatinib pazopanib trastuzumab investigational . Up 174 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
