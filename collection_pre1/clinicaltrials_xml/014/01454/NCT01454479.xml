	<brief_summary>Endometrial cancer ( EC ) 8th common female cancer Taiwan . Its incidence increase recent year , around 1,200 new case per year . The outcome recurrent EC disappointing , except focal recurrence could irradiate remove . Chemotherapy currently common salvage treatment recurrent endometrial cancer . However , response rate ( RR ) 2nd-line treatment approximately 0-27.3 % , short median time progression , 2-3.9 month low overall survival , 6.4-11 month . Due progress study molecular genetic basis cancer cellular signal pathway , target therapy develop various cancer treatment . A Gynecologic Oncology Group study find 44 % advanced endometrial cancer HER &gt; =2+ ratio HER2 : chromosome 17 ( CEP17 ) &gt; =2 . Another study show HER &gt; =2+ see 47 % carcinosarcoma . These evidence indicate HER2 gene amplification HER2 overexpression occur endometrial cancer carcinosarcoma , especially high grade recurrence . Lapatinib ( L ) , oral inhibitor EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) HER2 ( human epidermal growth receptor ) , show effective treatment HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . Ixabepilone semisynthetic analog natural product epothilone B , recently approve US Food Drug Administration treatment option metastatic breast cancer . It also observe lapatinib + ixabepilone kill breast tumor cell trastuzumab + paclitaxel vitro . Two GOG ( Gynecologic Oncology Group ) study report weekly Ixabepilone 2nd-line chemotherapy provide similar RR 3-weekly regimen 14.3 % platinum- taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer less severe toxicity . The combination lapatinib ixabepilone expect become effective treatment recurrent endometrial cancer carcinosarcoma , ideal dose yet survey .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Lapatinib ( Tykerb ) Plus Ixabepilone ( Ixempra ) 2nd-line Treatment Patients With HER-2 Overexpressed Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Carcinoma Carcinosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive weekly Ixabepilone 32 mg/m2 ( D1 ) 4-level oral Lapatinib 500-1250 mg daily continuously . The recommended duration treatment patient 21 day cycle total 6 cycle disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient 's refusal occur .</detailed_description>
