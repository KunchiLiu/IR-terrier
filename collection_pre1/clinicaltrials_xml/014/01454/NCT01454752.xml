	<brief_summary>Although risk malaria greatest early childhood , significant number schoolchildren remain risk malaria infection , clinical illness death . By time reach school , many child already acquire clinical immunity ability limit parasite growth , thus infection asymptomatic go undetected untreated . Asymptomatic parasitaemia contributes anaemia , reduce concentration learning classroom , intervention aim reduce asymptomatic parasite carriage may bring education , well health , benefit . Intermittent parasite clearance ( IPC ) deliver school simple intervention , readily integrate broad school health programme , may usefully supplement community-distribution insecticide-treated net ( ITNs ) country policy universal coverage net . This study seek establish whether intermittent parasite clearance undertaken year end malaria transmission season reduce malaria parasite carriage anaemia amongst school-going child already use insecticide-treated net , consequent impact school attendance performance , order ass suitability inclusion standard intervention school health programme area seasonal malaria transmission .</brief_summary>
