	<detailed_description>Objective : This project examine effectiveness tailor text message enhancement computerize tailor intervention ( CTI ) smoke cessation Veterans . It theorize ubiquity sophistication today 's wireless mobile technology would represent new mode delivery empirically base smoking cessation behavioral health intervention . CTIs show increase promise useful behavior change program improve health behavior ; however , ubiquity sophistication today 's wireless mobile technology represent new mode delivery evidence-based smoking cessation behavioral health intervention . The CTI base Transtheoretical Model Behavior Change ( TTM ) develop Pro-Change Behavior Systems , Inc. Research Design : This randomize , prospective pilot employ 2 ( group ) x 3 ( timepoint ) research design . Veteran smoker recruit nationally direct mailing , Facebook ad , community newsletter , poster , flyer . In addition randomize control trial ( RCT ) , focus group ( n=9 ) individual usability test ( n=5 ) conduct order ass acceptability graphic user interface , question , tailor program content Veteran smoker . The pilot study test effectiveness CTI alone CTI plus individualized text messaging enhancement reduce smoke behavior Veterans . In addition smoking cessation , readiness change negative health behavior � alcohol use , healthy eating , exercise � also assess . Summary Research Methodology Procedures : Usability Testing : Five separate usability test conduct CTI smoke cessation program use combination Think Aloud protocol Wizard Oz approach . Usability test software use take note record participant interaction program . Participants provide qualitative quantitative feedback overall presentation usability program . All interview data cod , categorize , summarize feedback report revision system could adapt . Pilot Study : At three timepoints , participant complete brief Health Risk Intervention ( HRI ) , two additional smoking assessment , smoke cessation ( SC ) intervention . The HRI assessment determine baseline readiness change smoke several related health behavior , smoke cessation intervention provide assessment feedback participant ' confidence quit smoking , decisional balance , use various change strategy . Following baseline HRI SC intervention , CTI system randomize participant either treatment group ( Tx ) , also receive CTI , treatment-plus group ( Tx-plus ) , receive CTI tailor text message . The study conduct entirely anonymous . All participant give three month ' access web-based CTI system . The Tx participant receive online feedback narratives/report participant receive upon completion online Smoking Cessation intervention . Tx-plus participant also receive individualized text message cell phone 2-5 time per week ( number message correlate participant 's stage change ) provide expert guidance , encouragement , reminder support smoke cessation effort . Findings : Four-hundred forty-six Veterans recruit baseline . All participant active smoker , distribute across stage change 11.9 % Precontemplation ( n=53 ; intend change next 6 month ) ; 63 % Contemplation ( n=281 ; intend change next 6 month ) , 25.1 % Preparation ( n=112 ; intend change next 30 day ) . Two-hundred thirty-five individual ( 52.7 % ) complete one-month three-month follow-up : n=116 treatment group ( CTI ; Tx ) n=119 treatment-plus group ( CTI plus text message ; Tx-plus ) . Results indicate CTI-plus-text-messaging intervention outperform CTI-only intervention unprecedented quit rate . For participant Tx group 32.8 % quit smoke three-month follow-up ; however , Tx-plus group quit rate 43.2 % . These finding highly encouraging , exceed quit rate find CTI intervention group almost 15 % ( Krebs , Prochaska &amp; Rossi , 2010 ) . Summary Participant Experiences : While data available participant complete study , indication User Satisfaction Scale , well open-ended question , Veterans find CTI tailor text message appropriate relevant . In addition , participant Tx-plus group also indicate text message helpful , timely useful . There adverse event report . Summary Current Risk - Potential Benefit Assessment base Study Results : This study able demonstrate TTM appropriate model promote multiple behavior change Veterans . Furthermore , addition tailor text message increase effect smoking cessation intervention ( CTI ) improve quit rate Tx-plus group level unprecedented literature . Additionally , individual risk health behavior progress A M without intervention . For Veterans ready in-person psychotherapy , practical issue attend therapy session , fear stigma associate seek mental health care , Veteran-tailored , motivational enhancement CTI may provide unique benefit . In addition , Veterans smoke comorbid behavioral risk factor may find CTI sufficient resolve problem . In sense , adapt CTI make evidence-based mental health care accessible Veterans need without add concern stigma cost . Impact/Significance : This Final Abstract research project . This study first adapt smoke cessation Internet-based CTI provide personalize feedback cell phone reduce smoke behavior military Veterans . The finding suggest behavior change intervention successfully deliver Veterans via Internet , tailor text message significantly enhance intervention effect .</detailed_description>
