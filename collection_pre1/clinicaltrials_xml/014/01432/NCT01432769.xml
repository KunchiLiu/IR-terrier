	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Malnutrition complication occur frequently hospitalize patient influence treatment efficacy , risk complication , cost , prognosis , mortality hospital stay . Cardiac Cachexia complication characterize weight loss suggest different mechanism explain : poor diet , intestinal malabsorption , impaired metabolism , loss nutrient digestive tract urinary tract , increase protein loss decrease anabolism , increase basal metabolic rate . It report reduction mortality cardiac patient higher body mass index ( BMI ) , potential protective effect know obesity paradox . In clinical study determine whether BMI influence risk mortality acute decompensated heart failure , author compare BMI 108 927 hospitalized patient note hospital mortality decrease BMI increase , decrease risk death 10 % every 5 unit increase BMI patient . Moreover , enteral nutrition within first 48hr surgery , help maintain integrity intestinal mucosa reduces secretion catabolic hormone . A meta-analysis show 85 % high-risk surgical patient tolerate enteral nutrition early postoperative period . As nutritional support critically ill patient , enteral keep physiological mechanism , low incidence complication low cost . Nutritional support critically ill patient three objective : conserve body mass , modulate immune function metabolic response moderate stress . OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY : To determine effect implement nutritional support protocol outcome cardiovascular surgery patient . METHODOLOGY : The investigator perform controlled clinical trial adult patient , gender admit coronary intensive care UMAE . IMSS No.1 , undergone cardiac surgery without pump . There nutritional screening patient malnutrition include random group A ( immunomodulatory individualize diet ) group B ( conventional nutritional treatment ) . The protocol give nutritional support enterally hospital stay . The progress nutritional status measure weight , BMI , albumin , transferrin , total count lymphocyte total protein addition hospital stay , complication mortality . A comparison effect individualize nutritional support standard control group perform . ANALYSIS : The result empty database Excel . The investigator use statistical package : NCSS 2007 ( 01/07/1919 ) SPSS ( 15.0 ) . Qualitative variable express percentage , quantitative variable mean standard deviation distribution normal . The result analyze accord intention treat . Comparison nutritional status various quantitative indicator make paired test Mann Whitney accord distribution . Categorical variable express proportion compare use Chi Square test . All test consider significant p value less 5 % .</detailed_description>
