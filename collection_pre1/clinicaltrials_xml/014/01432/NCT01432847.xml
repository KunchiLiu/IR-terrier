	<brief_summary>Background : - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy ( Best disease ) , Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration ( L-ORD ) , Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) affect retina , light sense area back eye . Doctors safely obtain retinal cell study disease . However , cell collect hair follicle , skin , blood use research . Researchers want collect cell people Best disease , L-ORD , AMD , compare cell healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To collect hair , skin , blood sample study three eye disease affect retina : Best disease , L-ORD , AMD . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age Best disease , L-ORD , AMD least one eye . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - The study require one visit National Eye Institute . - Participants screen medical eye disease history . They also eye exam . - Participants provide hair sample , blood sample , skin biopsy . The hair collect back head , skin collect inside upper arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study establish repository biospecimens generate induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell , use determine molecular mechanism follow potentially blind eye disease : Best Vitelliform Dystrophy ( Best Disease ) ; Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration ( L-ORD ) ; Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) ; Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) ; Joubert syndrome ; X-linked retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) ; oculocutaneous albinism , Stargardt ABCA4 gene mutation ; Waardenburg syndrome , coloboma , Enhanced S-Cone syndrome ( ESCS ) , Spinocerebellar Ataxia , Type 7 ( SCA7 ) eye disease associate MITF , PAX2 , PAX6 gene mutation . Skin fibroblast , hair keratinocytes , and/or blood cell may collect participant retinal disease age , gender ethnicity-matched healthy participant . Although research involve multiple different ocular cell type patient may perform , vast majority work center retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) neural retina . RPE and/or neural retinal cell generate iPS cell participant retinal disease healthy volunteer use analyze molecular mechanism involve disease initiation progression . In addition , iPS cell-derived ocular cell use perform high throughput ( HTP ) drug screen aim suppress molecular phenotype disease identify potential therapeutic agent disease . Objectives : The primary objective study generate participant-iPS cell differentiate ocular cell type , use study molecular mechanism develop treatment Best disease , L-ORD , AMD , LCA , Joubert syndrome , X-linked RP , OCA , Startgardt disease , Waardenburg syndrome , coloboma , ESCS , SCA7 eye disease associate MITF , PAX2 , PAX6 gene mutation . This objective carry three phase . First , study establish repository fibroblast , keratinocytes , and/or blood cell collect participant eye disease match control without eye disease . Second , somatic cell repository use generate iPS cell , differentiate RPE , neural retinal and/or ocular cell . These cell use elucidate molecular pathway lead disease pathogenesis . In third phase , participant-specific ocular cell use perform high throughput drug screen identify novel potential therapeutic compound . The cell obtain protocol may genetically modify may transplant animal laboratory . Study Population : We plan recruit 25 participant Best disease , 25 participant L-ORD , 100 participant AMD , 35 participant early onset retinal degeneration and/or LCA , 25 participant Joubert syndrome , 25 participant X-linked RP , 50 OCA , 25 Stargardt disease ABCA4 mutation , 25 eye disease due MITF mutation , 25 Waardenburg syndrome , 25 eye disease due PAX2 mutation , 25 eye disease due PAX6 mutation , 25 participant coloboma , 5 participant ESCS without macular edema , 25 participant SCA7 , 465 healthy volunteer without eye disease . If possible , unaffected sibling relatives participant eye disease include healthy volunteer . Design : In basic science , research-oriented study , skin , hair , and/or blood sample may collect affected participant eye diseases and/or genetic mutation study , control participant match age , gender ethnicity . The sample collection procedure incur minimal risk adult participant . For on-site minor participant , skin biopsy procedure minor increment minimal risk . Offsite minor participant undergo skin biopsy.This study typically require one visit participant . Participants may request return initial sample ( ) produce adequate cell study laboratory . Participants previously enrol provide sample research-grade iPS cell generation may return additional visit provide sample clinical-grade iPS cell generation , eligible . The skin fibroblast , keratinocyte , and/or blood sample use generate participant-specific iPS cell , cell differentiate RPE , neural retinal and/or ocular cell type . iPS cell may make sample . The investigator use sample research study aim identify molecular signal pathway underlie disease onset progression develop potential therapeutic treatment eye disease study . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure study include creation iPS cell least one three type somatic tissue collect participant , differentiation iPS cell RPE , neural retinal cell and/or ocular cell , identification molecular physiological phenotype cell may link onset progression Best disease , L-ORD , AMD , LCA , Joubert syndrome , X-linked RP , OCA , Stargardt disease , Waardenburg syndrome , coloboma , ESCS , SCA7and eye disease due MITF , PAX2 , PAX6 mutation . This analysis may lead discovery therapeutic intervention disease . There specific participant-based clinical outcome protocol . Participants , general , see protocol , ascertain and/or receive standard care NEI Evaluation Treatment Protocol ( 08-EI-0169 ) NEI protocol . In rare case , participant may request return clinic initial sample ( ) produce adequate cell study laboratory .</detailed_description>
