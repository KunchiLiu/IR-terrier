	<brief_summary>The aim study demonstrate association paracetamol / ondansetron effective association paracetamol / droperidol treatment pain child follow tonsillectomy .

	<brief_title>Drug Interactions Between Paracetamol Setrons Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tonsillectomy common operation perform child associate mark pain high incidence nausea vomit . Therefore , national international guideline recommend use setron prevention nausea vomit also systematic administration paracetamol help control postoperative pain . However , potential interaction setrons paracetamol report different animal study human volunteer although existence never find clinic . Indeed , several hypothesis propose explain mechanism action paracetamol treatment pain . However , recent one involve endocannabinoid system spinal serotonin receptor . Serotonin receptor also involve mechanism action antiemetic setrons . Indeed , drug serotonin antagonist . Therefore , investigator hypothesize concomitant administration paracetamol ondansetron lead interaction decrease analgesic effect paracetamol . Patients age 2-7 year old scheduled tonsillectomy recruit . They receive intraoperatively intravenous paracetamol together either ondansetron droperidol . Pain score use CHEOPS scale record 24 hour . Furthermore , patient receive i.v . morphine operation recovery room necessary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug postoperative pain ; ward , oral codeine administer need . Pain score record regularly 24 hour together opioid consumption incidence nausea vomit period . Any adverse event also record .</detailed_description>
