	<brief_title>Efficacy Radiation Therapy Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) Treat Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) invade portal vein represent predispose several disastrous clinical condition . First , obstruction portal vein per se accompany large arterio-portal shunt cause rapid deterioration hepatic function development portal hypertension complication . Second , vascular invasion risk factor future extrahepatic metastasis . Third , severe complication include hepatic failure may develop transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) since hepatic arterial portal venous blood flow interrupt simultaneously . For reason , TACE routinely recommend clinical setting , although controversy . Patients HCC invade portal vein dismal prognosis . In Asian prospective randomize trial evaluate efficacy TACE , median survival HCC patient unilobar portal vein invasion 2.6 month control group . Though 5.1 month TACE group , difference significant statistically . Recent two phase III randomize placebo-controlled trial reveal sorafenib prolong patient 's survival Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) advance stage include HCC invade portal vein , thereby guideline endorsed American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) recommend standard therapy patient . However , advent sorafenib , many treatment modality use Asian country patient . Examples surgical resection , TACE , hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy , radiation therapy ( RT ) . Accordingly , guideline many Asian country still adopt therapy patient portal vein invasion , despite solid evidence . Radiation traditionally think limited role treatment HCC . This concept partly result limited ability deliver lethal dos use external beam technique past , since whole-liver tolerance radiation report low . However , recent use three- four-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( RT ) permit delivery high dose radiation intrahepatic tumor increase even decrease radiation-induced toxicity . Accordingly , several recent retrospective study perform Asia suggest RT combine transarterial chemoinfusion ( TACI ) TACE may beneficial effect HCC patient portal vein invasion . In retrospective analysis , median survival CTP A patient unilobar portal vein invasion treat RT TACE/I 22 month , obviously longer reported median survival advance stage patient BCLC stag system . The median survival 6 month patient treat TACE/I . However , survival benefit obvious patient main portal vein invasion . Despite encourage data , radiation-induced hepatotoxicity still major obstacle widespread use RT treatment HCC even 3D- 4D-conformal radiation therapy . The reported incidence hepatotoxicity RT 15-20 % , half case fact relate hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation , preventable preemptive antiviral therapy . Other factor area RT field dose may relate occurrence hepatotoxicity . Techniques deliver radiation beam also important track respiratory movement ( 4D-RT ) minimize complication . In center , radiation therapy mostly focus tumor portion invade portal vein deliver sufficient radiation dose minimize toxicity . With approach , control tumor portion invade portal vein RT remnant parenchymal portion tumor TACE . Though TACE also carry risk hepatic failure HCC patient portal vein invasion , retrospective analysis ( submit data ) show perform safely CTP A patient HCC invade 1st 2nd order branch portal vein tumor volume le 1/2 total liver volume . Grade 3 4 hepatotoxicity develop 10 % patient . Although slight difference protocol , several study also report effectiveness safety approach . However , still limitation interpret pre-existing data . Since retrospective study , could high probability treatment-related toxicity underestimate intention-to-treat analysis perform . And also , wide variability treatment schedule , evaluate response treatment and/or treatment-related toxicity among study . Therefore , study , prospectively evaluate patient 's survival , tumor response , safety RT follow TACE Child A patient unilobar portal vein invasion .</detailed_description>
