	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination selective internal radiation ( SIR ) -Spheres yttrium-90 attached cetuximab . Some participant also take erlotinib combination . Yttrium-90 microspheres design treat cancer spread liver . SIR-Spheres design deliver radiation directly liver . This radiation may cause tumor cell die . Cetuximab erlotinib drug design block epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR protein help cancer cell grow . Blocking EGFR may stop tumor grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial With SIR-Spheres Cetuximab +/- Erlotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , doctor decide group base medical history . - Group 1 receive SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 attached cetuximab . - Group 2 receive SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 attach , cetuximab , erlotinib . Once decided combination receive , assign dose level cetuximab base join study . Up 3 dose level cetuximab test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dos combination find . All study participant receive dose level SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 attached base result `` break-through '' scan ( describe ) . If assign Group 2 , also receive erlotinib . If tolerate erlotinib well 1 cycle , may begin receive high dose erlotinib Cycle 3 beyond . Break-through Scan : You `` break-through '' scan within 29 day receive SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres . This scan measure supply blood lung also use check liver . For test , small amount radioactive material inject liver image take see material move lung liver . The radioactive material give catheter vein groin . A catheter sterile , flexible tube place groin artery artery lead liver local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail . The result test use determine receive full partial dose SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres . Radiation Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres Day 1 Cycle 1 . Before receive SIR-Spheres Yttrium-90 microspheres , receive sedative drug vein put sleep . SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres give catheter vein groin . After give yttrium-90 microspheres , catheter remove pressure apply groin stop bleeding . You monitor 6 hour check side effect . If need , give pain medication infusion . Your study doctor decide pain medication give . Cetuximab give vein 1 time week Weeks 2-4 Cycle 1 , 1 time every week Cycles 2 beyond . The first time receive cetuximab , give 2 hour . Every time receive cetuximab , give 1 hour . If assign receive erlotinib , take mouth 1 time day start Day 1 Cycle 2 . You take time day . You take empty stomach either 1 hour 2 hour eat . The study staff give instruction take erlotinib . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Before receive SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres , blood vessel check . For test , receive x-ray dye catheter help study staff look artery lead liver surround area . - You physical exam medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Weeks 2 4 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . About every 4 week start begin Cycle 2 : - You physical exam medical history record - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . Length Study : You receive study drug long benefit . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . SIR-Spheres FDA-approved commercially available treat metastatic colorectal cancer spread liver . Yttrium-90 microspheres FDA-approved hepatic arterial therapy treatment liver metastasis . Cetuximab FDA-approved commercially available treat head neck colorectal cancer . Erlotinib FDA-approved commercially available treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) pancreatic cancer . The use combination treat advance cancer investigational . Up 136 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
