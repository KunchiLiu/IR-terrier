	<brief_summary>The almost 724,000 Americans survivor melanoma estimate 4 first degree relative per case ; thus , 2.8 million Americans increase risk develop melanoma comparison general public . Skin self-examination ( SSE ) assistance partner individual could improve survival . If effective , workbook test proposal could distribute people risk develop melanoma large scale mean physicians office .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Population base registry document survival melanoma , grow public health problem approximately 70,000 new melanoma case estimate 8,600 death 2010 , dependent thickness melanoma . By facilitate seek medical care , skin self-examination ( SSEs ) individual prior history melanoma , risk develop subsequent melanoma , may lead early detection treatment melanoma usually effective . Thus , research enhances early detection warrant application directly test novel method train high-risk melanoma patient partner conduct SSEs promote early detection . Our propose research build upon strength R21 : ) establish in-person training conduct SSE partner significantly enhance SSE performance 4 month intervention , b ) develop pilot test manualized take-home workbook training approach ( WORKBOOK ) . Our pilot work WORKBOOK partner suggest patient-partner dyad ( n = 21 ) perceive readable , useful , short term 4 month follow-up , empirically equivalent promote SSE knowledge , skill , behavior compare patient-partner dyad in-person partner train condition ( n = 19 ) . Our propose research build NCI fund study conduct formal examination 430 pair ( 860 subject ) randomize either in-person workbook training vs. assessment control group receive standard care 2 year longitudinal study 4 month interval evaluation . An additional group 70 pair ( 140 subject ) add test tablet computer-based program . Our propose research directly test novel method train Stage I IIB melanoma patient , 5 year survival 80-90 % , partner , conduct SSEs . We compare efficacy in-person training vs. workbook patient partner vs. control SSE knowledge/skill acquisition retention , SSE performance accuracy short ( 4 8 month post baseline ) long term basis ( 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 month post baseline ) examine whether partner-patient relationship-qualities moderate relationship training approach SSEs knowledge/skill acquisition retention , SSE performance accuracy . The tablet computer-based program also test efficacy compare previous group . Establishing health promotion partnership important risk develop melanoma SSE difficult successfully perform individual . It expect workbook promote SSE least well perhaps well in-person training become easily disseminated SSE training approach dependent time teach skill non-MD clinical office staff .</detailed_description>
