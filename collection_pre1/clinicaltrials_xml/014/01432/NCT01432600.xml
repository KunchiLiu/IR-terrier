	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see whether pomalidomide help people myeloma . Researchers also want find pomalidomide safe tolerable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Combination With High Dose Dexamethasone Oral Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two part study : - The first part study ( Phase 1 ) determine safe dose medication cyclophosphamide combination pomalidomide dexamethasone . - Once safe dose determine , study ( Phase 2 ) look see difference effectiveness pomalidomide combination high dose dexamethasone without cyclophosphamide treatment patient myeloma , relapse become refractory ( respond ) prior treatment .</detailed_description>
