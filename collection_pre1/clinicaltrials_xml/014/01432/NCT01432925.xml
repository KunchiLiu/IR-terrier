	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Rationale : Buruli ulcer , cause Mycobacterium ulcerans , ulcerative disease endemic West Africa . It often lead functional limitation . Treatment extensive surgery , 2005 gradually antibiotic treatment eight week rifampicin streptomycin add . Observation Buruli ulcer lesion limit size antibiotic treatment show treatment paradoxical increase lesion , decrease lesion week 14 . Current WHO protocols advise decide whether surgery need four week start antibiotic . This might early heal process . The investigator hypothesize delay surgery safe , result reduction number surgical intervention . Objectives : Primary Objective study compare need surgical treatment standard timing surgery end eight week antimicrobial treatment policy postpone surgical treatment week 14 . Secondary Objectives study whether postpone surgery lead less extensive surgery change frequency functional limitation ; Study design : Patients randomize surgery week 8 start antibiotic treatment week 14 start treatment . Reasons treat doctor decide intervene surgery accord current clinical practice clearly define protocol . Standard care eight week rifampicin streptomycin give . All patient follow lesional size use acetate sheet recording use follow-up . Study population : Patients clinical picture Buruli ulcer disease confirm diagnostic test district cover Buruli ulcer center Lalo Allada , Benin . Patients pregnant , contraindication general anaesthesia child three year old exclude . 130 Patients treatment arm include detect difference percentage patient need surgery 20 percent . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome measure number patient heal without surgery . Secondary outcome measure extent surgery measurement lesional size , functional limitation end treatment one year start treatment duration admission .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients clinical picture Buruli ulcer disease district cover Buruli ulcer center Lalo Allada , Benin , include start antibiotic treatment . All stage disease include . Only patient confirm disease direct microscopy follow acidfast stain PCR include . Patients standard treatment eight week rifampicin streptomycin reason , exclude study . Treatment macrolide quinolone antibiotic , antituberculous medication , immunemodulatory drug include corticosteroid within previous one month . Patients compliant antibiotic therapy exclude well . Noncompliance define use &lt; 70 % prescribed antibiotic . Patients contraindication general anaesthesia able participate . Pregnancy . Osteomyelitis . Lesion close eye , preferred standard treatment wait effect antibiotic treatment extent surgery . The BUFLS ( Buruli ulcer functional limitation score ) apply child three year therefore participate .
