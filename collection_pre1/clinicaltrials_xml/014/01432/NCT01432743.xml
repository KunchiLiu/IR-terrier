	<brief_summary>Comparison Two Strategies Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation - comparison ablation guide Cartomerge NavX Fusion . 3D map system widely use catheter ablation AF . Integration previously acquire image leave atrium electroanatomical ( EA ) map offer several potential advantage , include visualisation complex anatomy leave atrium , reduction fluoroscopy time improved result . The two widely use system Cartomerge ( Biosense Webster , etc ) NavX Fusion ( SJM , etc ) . Although system independently validate , clinical utility previously directly compare randomise trial</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cartomerge Versus NavX Fusion Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomise either NavX Fusion Cartomerge . They undergo standard catheter ablation procedure data collect . Both system routinely use clinical practise . This comparison trial 2 mapping technology .</detailed_description>
