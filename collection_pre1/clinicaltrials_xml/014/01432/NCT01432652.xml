	<brief_title>The Efficacy Aspirin Postoperative Period Vascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 15 % general population show resistance antiplatelet effect aspirin , due genetic polymorphism factor . This resistance cause increase myocardial infarction death patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . Aspirin resistance detect whole blood impedance aggregometry use Multiplate® analyzer . The population patient undergo vascular surgery particular risk suffer myocardial infarction perioperative period high prevalence risk factor . Most patient treat aspirin , measure primary secondary prevention . In study aim establish baseline aspirin efficacy , measure Multiplate® analyzer , high-risk population evaluate change aspirin efficacy first five day postoperative period . It hypothesis state chronic inflammation , accompany severe , generalized atherosclerosis result high incidence aspirin resistance population . Also , surgical trauma postoperative thrombocytosis may reduce efficacy aspirin postoperative period , partially explain increase incidence postoperative myocardial infarction population . In whole blood impedance aggregometry , electrical impedance blood sample measure place two electrodes recipient . After addition platelet activator , impedance increase platelet accumulate electrode surface . Several activator , test patency different platelet receptor use . In study , blood drawn day surgery , daily fifth postoperative day . Arachidonic acid , ADP , TRAP-6 collagen use activator . The first specifically test platelet reactivity thromboxane A2 . Aspirin inhibit pathway , increase impedance therefore limit patient treated drug . The three test perform evaluate evolution overall platelet reactivity postoperative period .</detailed_description>
