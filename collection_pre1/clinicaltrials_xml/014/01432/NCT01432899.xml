	<brief_summary>Background : - Childhood-onset dystonia cause brain injury . It cause muscle contraction twist movement person dystonia control . The term hemidystonia use one side body affect . When dystonia start childhood , brain nerve may develop normally . People hemidystonia become disabled unwanted posture twist dystonia cause . More research need determine dystonia affect brain development . Objectives : - To study brain function people hemidystonia . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 40 year age develop hemidystonia age 13 . Only one wrist may affect hemidystonia , participant must least movement wrist . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - This study require five visit NIH Clinical Center : screen visit four study visit . Each visit last 3 hour . Visits schedule week . The study procedure may do order . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants follow test : - Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan . During scan , participant ask move hand wrist hear tone . - Motor test arm movement , balance , walk . These test may also examine nerve development muscle tone . - Two transcranial magnetic stimulation session study electrical activity muscle brain . These session may also involve sensory test . Participants hear test first session second session . - No treatment hemidystonia provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective In childhood-onset hemidystonia , motor sensory abnormality pose great challenge voluntary movement . In effort inform future method treatment disorder , study seek ( 1 ) characterize involuntary muscle activity , ( 2 ) explore neurophysiologic mechanism involuntary muscle activity , ( 3 ) characterize abnormality sensation , ( 4 ) ass performance two sensorimotor task ( voluntary postural control , reach-to-grasp arm movement ) , ( 5 ) explore brain abnormality use image childhood-onset hemidystonia . Study Population The dystonia group consist 40 individual ( age 7-40 year ) childhood-onset hemidystonia . The control group consist 40 individual within age range neurological disorder . Design This cross-sectional study , multiple assessment perform short period . Results dystonia group compare result control group . Due laterality brain injury hemidystonia , outcomes arm cortical hemisphere compare . Outcomes within dystonia group correlate validated dystonia rating scale well age time injury . Outcome Measures In Objective 1 , analyze time involuntary electromyographic ( EMG ) activity kinematics trigger dystonic arm various task . In Objective 2 , investigate various type intracortical inhibition ( short intracortical inhibition , long intracortical inhibition , contralateral silent period , ipsilateral silent period ) intracortical facilitation motor cortical region control dystonic wrist flexor voluntary contraction wrist extensor use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . In addition , perform coherence analysis EMG activity wrist flexor extensor muscle electroencephalographic ( EEG ) activity primary motor cortex contralateral wrist muscle . In Objective 3 , test tactile sense ( spatial temporal ) , vibration sense , stereognosis hand . In Objective 4 , analyze seat limit stability ( voluntary postural control ) , time amplitude EMG activity kinematics arm reach grasp arm movement . In Objective 5 , obtain brain scan structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , rest state functional connectivity MRI , functional MRI simple task .</detailed_description>

Passive motion least 15 degree extension 15 degree flexion neutral wrist joint Agreement drink caffeine alcohol 24 hour study session agent modify brain activity may confound outcome measure . Additional inclusion criterion individual dystonia : Childhoodonset ( 13 year age ) hemidystonia one wrist . Diagnosis dystonia make base Hypertonia Assessment Tool ( HAT ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers : Presence neurological disorder Individuals Dystonia : Botulinum toxin injection flexor carpus radialis extensor carpus radialis last 6 month Concurrent use medicine muscle tone ( e.g. , baclofen , trihexyphenedyl , dantrolene sodium , tizanidine , carbidopa/levodopa ) . If patient take medication daily , treat physician contact MAI determine acceptable subject temporarily discontinue medication ( ) . If risk weaning , stop medication deem harmless , MAI and/or treat physician determine schedule wean , stop medication . The goal subject medication ( ) 24 hour prior participate test study . For subject , least 4 day schedule research visit avoid prolonged time medication ( ) . Additional exclusion criterion TMS : Seizure last 2 year Concurrent use antiseizure medication Hearing loss Cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease , intracranial implant ( e.g . aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth safely remove . Additional exclusion criterion MRI : Inability lie flat back 1 hour Uncontrolled movement head lie supine determine MAI Discomfort small space 1 hour Cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease , intracranial implant ( e.g . aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth safely remove .
