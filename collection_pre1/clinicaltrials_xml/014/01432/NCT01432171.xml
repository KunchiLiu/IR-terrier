	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn antiepileptic ( anti-seizure ) treatment prevent seizures patient brain tumor yet seizure . Anti-seizure drug design decrease abnormal electrical activity brain play role develop seizure . In study , lacosamide use anti-seizure medication . Lacosamide compare placebo . A placebo drug . It look like study drug design treat disease illness . It design compare study drug learn study drug real effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lacosamide Seizure Prophylaxis High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) receive either lacosamide placebo . Neither doctor know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety study , study staff study doctor able find receiving . You take lacosamide placebo mouth 2 time day , time day , space close 12 hour apart possible . The study drug/placebo may take without food . Missed dose take within 6 hour schedule time . If vomit take study drug/placebo , take pill next schedule dose unless pill clearly identify vomit . You give drug diary fill day take study pill . The study staff explain fill diary . Study Visits : Every month : Â° You call ask question side effect may . mood . At Months 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 : - Your medical history record , include drug may take and/or may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You neurological exam . - At Months 4 , 7 , 10 , ask side effect may . At time study , extra test may perform doctor think need safety . The study doctor tell extra test . Length Study : You may take lacosamide placebo 1 year . Your study doctor may take study early feel best interest , new health problem make take part study possibly dangerous , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You consider off-study complete Long-Term Follow-Up . End-of-Dosing Visit : After stop take study drug/placebo , end-of-dosing visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record , include drug may take and/or may take side effect may . - You complete questionnaire mood . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You neurological exam . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month End-of-Study visit , 5 year , may call ask feeling schedule require monthly follow visit . This phone call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Lacosamide FDA approve commercially available treatment seizure . Its use reduce risk seizure patient malignant gliomas investigational . Up 302 patient take part multicenter study . Up 60 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
