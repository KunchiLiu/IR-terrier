	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Maintain Normal Cerebral Oxygen Saturation High-Risk Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proportion high-risk patient require cardiac surgery high-risk cardiac surgery increase . These population patient increase risk perioperative morbidity mortality . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) evaluation cardiac surgery show impact perioperative management patient improve outcome . Near infrared-reflectance spectroscopy ( NIRS ) technique employ since mid-1970 's use non-invasive continuous monitor balance cerebral oxygen delivery consumption . Two recent randomize trial show association correction cerebral desaturation shorter recovery room hospital stay non-cardiac surgery , decrease major organ dysfunction intensive care length stay coronary artery bypass . By combine NIRS TEE high-risk patient , optimal tissue perfusion could achieve perioperative morbidity mortality could reduce .</detailed_description>
