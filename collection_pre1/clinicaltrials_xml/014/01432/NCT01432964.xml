	<brief_summary>In craniofacial trauma , involvement orbital structure note 40 % case ( Ellis 1985 ) . Post-traumatic orbital deformity cause incorrect reconstruction orbital dimension severe complication cause enophthalmos , diplopia visual acuity disturbance . To prevent complication , immediate repair orbital injury restoration normal anatomy indicate orbital floor fracture . With help biodegradable implant small medium-sized defect easily manage ( Büchel 2005 , Lieger 2010 ) . In extensive fracture however , calvarian bone titanium mesh consider provide sufficient support orbital content . Calvarial bone difficult mould adapt form size orbital lesion . In addition , donor site morbidity disregard . Orbital reconstruction mesh hand always available easy apply . There however important requirement mesh , biocompatibility , excellent stability , optimal adaptability patient comfort . Recently , company Medartis develop titanium mesh feature low profile . In order regain normal function , normal anatomy re-established . It therefore seem reasonable ass implant , would facilitate orbital reconstruction without disturb normal anatomy size , profile height property . The purpose study ass use accuracy low profile titanium mesh primary internal orbital reconstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Low Profile Titanium Mesh Orbital Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Extensive bone loss orbital trauma require reconstruction preserve ocular function aesthetic . The optimal material orbital reconstruction remain controversial . Today multitude autogenous alloplastic material use orbital reconstruction , include methylmethacrylate , Teflon , silicone , Supramid , Marlex , Silastic , gelatin film , bioactive glas , bone cartilage ( Haug 1999 ) . The use alloplastic material temper complication infection , displacement extrusion , fistula cyst formation . During past two decade , autogenous bone graft become increasingly popular orbital reconstruction . Unfortunately , problem bone graft occur include unpredictable rate bone resorption risk subsequent dystopia delay enophthalmos , donor site complication , time consumption harvest variable graft thickness irregularity along difficulty graft contouring ( Park 2001 ) . These problem revive interest alloplastic alternative , particularly titanium alloy ( Park 2001 ) . Titanium show low infection rate , relate part excellent biocompatibility , manifest osseointegration . This circumstance think lessen rate infection . During past decade , different study examine titanium mesh orbital repair . Plates use study demonstrate minimum profile height 0.25mm . Objective Assess use accuracy low profile titanium mesh primary internal orbital reconstruction Methods Clinical assessment prior operation maxillofacial surgeon regard bone soft tissue lesion well concomitant injury . An ophthalmologist assess eye lesion quantify eye mobility ( mm ) , bulb positioning ( Hertel 's exophthalmometry , mm ) well field binocular vision ( Goldmann perimetry , % total ) . Preoperative 1mm CT-scans obtain analyse size location defect well extend muscle entrapment . The fracture classify accord score introduce Jaquiery ( Jaquiery 2007 ) . Follow 2 , 6 12 week operation ( assessment see ) , include postoperative CT-scan within 12 week . Volume analysis CT compare two orbit ( OsiriX Medical Image Software ( Version 3.7.1 , www.osirix-viewer.com ) .</detailed_description>
