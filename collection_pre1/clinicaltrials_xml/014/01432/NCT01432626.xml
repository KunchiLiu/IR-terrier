	<brief_summary>Objective : The objective pilot study characterize cardiac uptake pattern I-123 mIBG stress-induced ( Takotsubo 's ) cardiomyopathy . Hypothesis : Perturbations sympathetic innervation underlie pathogenesis stress induce cardiomyopathy result abnormality I-123 mIBG cardiac imaging . Thus , planar SPECT I-123 MIBG image provide insight pathogenesis stress-induced cardiomyopathy , may lead development specific diagnostic criterion . Study design : This proposal prospective pilot study characterize perturbation cardiac sympathetic innervation patient stress induce cardiomyopathy perform planar SPECT I-123 MIBG image acute presentation recovery LV function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Since initial Japanese description Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy 1991 transient systolic dysfunction apical mid leave ventricular segment absence obstructive coronary artery disease , stress induce cardiomyopathy increasingly recognize Unites States . Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy account 1.2 2.2 percent case acute coronary syndrome . The current American Heart Association Statistical Update estimate approximately 1.2 million Americans experience acute coronary event 2010 . Based estimate , 15 26 thousand Americans stress induce cardiomyopathy annually . Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy also describe stroke critically ill patient . Post menopausal woman disproportionally affect , account 80 100 percent patient population . These patient classically present sign acute heart failure acute coronary syndrome severe emotional stress . The presentation may include chest pain , shortness breath , elevate troponin enzyme , ST segment elevation , deep T-wave inversion , ventricular arrhythmia , pulmonary edema elevate biomarkers . Cardiac catheterization reveals angiographically normal coronary artery ventriculogram echocardiogram show apical ballooning basal hyperkinesis . While majority patient recover complete function within day two week , eight percent patient die acute heart failure . The etiology stress-induced cardiomyopathy remain speculative . Catecholamine excess lead microvascular dysfunction direct cardiomyocyte toxicity hypothesize likely etiology . This hypothesis support fact patient Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy experience intense physical emotional stress . Furthermore , several observation support hypothesis . First , catecholamine level elevate patient stress induced cardiomyopathy presentation compare patient acute coronary syndrome . Second , multi-vessel coronary vasospasm transient myocardial perfusion defect identify repeatedly population . Third , myocardial biopsy show myocarditis , interstitial fibrosis mononuclear infiltrates , sign consistent catecholamine toxicity . Fourth , mouse model , elevate epinephrine level cause switch beta-2 adrenoreceptor mediate Gs protein signal Gi protein signal , negatively inotropic . These finding support theory alter sympathetic activity patient stress induce cardiomyopathy . Thus , base exist knowledge base intriguing disease , image approach specifically evaluate sympathetic activation state myocardium would appear ideally suit explore pathophysiology . I-123 radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine , ( mIBG ) imaging allows direct analysis cardiac sympathetic function structurally similar norepinephrine ( NE ) , transport cardiac sympathetic neuron human norepinephrine transporter 1 ( hNET1 ) , synaptic cleft . Unlike NE , mIBG metabolize monoamine oxidase catechol-o-methyl transferase . mIBG require intact myocardial sympathetic nervous system uptake , store presynaptic vesicle release stimulation acetylcholine . Experimental manipulation cardiac sympathetic function alters mIBG uptake distribution . Planar image acquisition enables evaluation sympathetic activation , SPECT characterize regional abnormality . Measurement heart mediastinal ratio early delay planimetry assess initial uptake washout tracer . mIBG uptake follow one three general pattern : good uptake retention , good uptake washout poor uptake . The different pattern likely represent level sympathetic activation , increase sympathetic tone heart failure-induced damage myocardial sympathetic nervous system . mIBG uptake altered patient diabetic neuropathy , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction . The uptake washout pattern correlate severity neuropathy , severity congestive heart failure , congestive heart failure treatment response , improvement ejection fraction , cardiac death ventricular arrhythmogenic potential . Preliminary data patient Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy show decrease mIBG uptake increase washout acute phase , improve retention leave ventricular functional recovery . Furthermore , regional decrease tracer uptake corresponds regional wall motion abnormality . However , systematic exploration mIBG uptake pattern consecutive patient Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy perform . Of note , PET image 11C Hydroxyephedrine describe similar sympathetic dysfunction Takotsubo 's cardiomyopathy .</detailed_description>
