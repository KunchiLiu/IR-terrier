	<brief_summary>For many patient blood cancer , stem cell transplantation family member unrelated donor remain potentially curative option . Unfortunately , 40 % patient develop chronic lung disease transplant , substantially increase risk death long-term . Currently , patient transplant-related lung disease treat combination steroid immunosuppressant drug , 1 5 improve . The importance study investigator aim prevent development transplant-related chronic lung disease first place . Because strong risk factor chronic lung disease prior viral respiratory tract infection , investigator think window opportunity intervene . As soon `` cold flu '' symptom start , investigator treat patient combination drug aim eliminate damage immune response trigger virus . In absence treatment , investigator believe lung-damaging immune response would persist even virus disappears . Our hope preventive treatment might avoid development chronic lung disease , would substantially increase long-term survival transplant patient . This pilot study . Once feasibility establish , investigator seek expand study definitive clinical trial .</brief_summary>
