The investigator propose conduct three-year influenza vaccine effectiveness study use commercially available southern hemisphere seasonal vaccine 2010 , include pandemic 2009 H1N1 component , 2011 2012 . The study evaluate effectiveness vaccine prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza , non-specific ARIs clinic household level , secondary influenza infection secondary ARIs . Our study hypothesis : Immunizing child influenza vaccine decrease influenza-associated acute respiratory infection among child may reduce number non-specific acute respiratory infection vaccinate child household contact .</brief_summary>

Ascertainment Influenza Illness : Primary Outcome Measure â€¢ Laboratory-confirmed influenza infection Secondary outcome measure - Medically attend ILI , SARI - Community-reported ILI SARI - Laboratory-confirmed influenza , medically attend ILI SARI , community-reported ILI SARI non-immunized household member In Lwak Kibera , field worker visit household weekly encourage resident go free clinic respiratory symptom . Currently , KEMRI/CDC surveillance data , Kibera , approximately 57 % people catchment area seek medical care ILI ( Range : 62 % child - 52 % adult ) people seek care , 72 % seek care Tabitha clinic . In Lwak , approximately 77 % people catchment area seek medical care ILI ( Range : 75 % child - 80 % adult ) people seek care , 34 % seek care Lwak clinic .
