These symptom combine known vaginal atrophy . Vaginal atrophy consequence line tissue vagina become thinner , dry , less elastic due lack estrogen . In addition , vaginal atrophy associate increase pH , create environment susceptible infection . The mucosal epithelium show sign severe atrophy cytological examination demonstrate increase number basal parabasal cell reduce number superficial cell . Estrogen treatment either hormone replacement therapy topical application common treatment vaginal atrophy . However , woman experience adverse reaction uterine bleeding , perineal pain breast pain many woman also reluctant use estrogen due general negative view topic society . Oxytocin peptide hormone , normally release circulation via pituitary . The well know effect oxytocin role female reproduction facilitation birth breast feeding . In addition , oxytocin vitro show exert positive effect proliferation human vaginal mucosal cell postmenopausal woman . Considering stimulatory effect oxytocin vaginal mucosal cell proliferation , topical application oxytocin vaginal mucosa may approach treat vaginal atrophy . In one previous placebo-controlled study 20 postmenopausal woman suffer vaginal atrophy , gel contain oxytocin topical intra-vaginal administration apply daily seven day .

Due limitation estrogens treatment vaginal atrophy , many postmenopausal woman leave without effective remedy . Hence , need alternative non-estrogenic treatment indication .
