	<brief_title>Effect Of Exenatide Treatment Liver Fat Content Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity characterize generalized expansion adipose tissue depot , increase tissue lipid content , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes . The adipocyte function storage depot fat endocrine organ release hormone response specific extracellular stimulus change metabolic status . These secreted protein , carry variety diverse function , refer collectively adipokines . The adipokines postulate play important role pathogenesis insulin resistance , hypertension , disorder coagulation , dyslipidemia , glucose intolerance , abnormality associate insulin resistance syndrome . These observation considerable interest recent study provide evidence increase hepatic fat content important determinant hepatic insulin resistance type 2 diabetic patient . Fatty liver common type 2 diabetic patient . The mechanism responsible increase hepatic fat content unclear . It suggest fatty liver result accelerate fatty acid mobilization expand visceral fat store deposition liver well decrease hepatic fatty acid oxidation . Weight loss human Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) associate decrease hepatic fat content . In addition , thiazolidinediones show reduce hepatic fat content improve hepatic insulin sensitivity patient type 2 diabetes well non-diabetic patient NAFLD . The thiazolidinediones initiate action bind peroxisome proliferator activator receptor ( PPAR ) , primarily locate adipocytes . Treatment insulin-resistant mouse well type 2 diabetic patient insulin sensitize PPAR activator , thiazolidinediones , increase plasma adiponectin level . Indirect evidence suggest adiponectin might mediate insulin-sensitizing effect PPAR agonist . Exenatide , Glucagon Like Peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonist approve treatment type 2 diabetes , elicit dose-dependent reduction body weight association improved glycemic control type 2 diabetic patient . In animal model obesity , exenatide reduces hepatic fat . However , effect exenatide treatment combination thiazolidinedione liver fat content plasma adipocytokines level patient type 2 diabetes remain investigated .</detailed_description>
