	<brief_summary>It hypothesize different inhalation profile ( inhalation flow rate versus time curve ) result different form patient training . Furthermore , significant inter-subject variability profile exist , circumstance , depend design different inhalation device ; dry powder inhaler different airflow resistance . The investigator also hypothesize spread flow rate versus time profile inhalation collect . Finally , profile analyze group human subject use define mean statistical range inhalation flow rate versus time curve . The investigator propose collect inhalation profile 20 'inhaler na√Øve ' healthy volunteer ( ) read typical inhaler package insert ( b ) formally train inhaler use pharmacist . No drug exposure occur . The data use pilot study ( ) show inter-subject variability inhalation profile use adult inhale realistic airflow resistance ( like inhaler ) follow different type training ( b ) show formal training change inhalation technique ( c ) provide database typical inspiratory profile use improvement realistic test inhaler laboratory . Since pulmonary deposition inhaler greatly depend upon way patient inhale , research result database improve design vitro characterization inhaler .</brief_summary>
