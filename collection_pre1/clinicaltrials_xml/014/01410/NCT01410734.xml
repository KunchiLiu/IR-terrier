	<brief_title>Fluorescence Imaging da Vinci Surgical System Intra-operative Near Infrared Imaging Biliary Tree ( 2-weeks Post-operatively )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 40 patient prospectively enrol multi-centre ( 5 centre ) single arm study . After give consent , patient undergo minimally invasive cholecystectomy da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging use Indocynine green ( ICG ) near infra-red light ( NIR ) identify surgically relevant anatomy biliary tree procedure . Efficacy endpoints The efficacy da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging Vision System identify biliary anatomy demonstrate successful detection ( 90 % ) one follow biliary vessel : Cystic duct , common hepatic duct ( CHD ) common bile duct ( CBD ) . Safety endpoint To observe report peri-operative safety outcome , include limited incidence adverse event allergic reaction ( rare accord current knowledge application ) . Safety endpoints meet affirm safety profile procedure , compare currently available literature .</detailed_description>
