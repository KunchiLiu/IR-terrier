	<brief_title>Gene Therapy X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective protocol reinitiate ex vivo gene therapy clinical protocol treat patient SCID-X1 without HLA identical family donor HLA identical unrelated donor ( bone marrow cord blood ) available adequate time clinical condition patient diagnosis ( approximately 6 week ) . This clinical protocol No . 2 SCID-X1 must efficient previous one must involve risk insertional mutagenesis significantly reduce compare first protocol . The main purpose study study toxicity : tolerance incidence serious adverse effect . Secondary goal evaluation immune reconstitution allow cure infection present time gene therapy , assessment integration site , finally long-term correction immunosuppression . 1. safety assessment : clinical effect , possible emergence clonal lymphocyte proliferation , potential activation proto-oncogene ; 2. efficacy assessment ex vivo transduction CD34 + hematopoietic stem cell patient use retroviral vector pSRS11.EFS.IL2RG.pre ; 3. assessment immune reconstitution : phenotype , number function different T , NK B cell subpopulation ; 4. longitudinal evaluation clinical effect term improvement complete restoration immunity ; 5. biological efficacy assessment new vector SIN , assessment molecular characteristic retroviral integration .</detailed_description>
