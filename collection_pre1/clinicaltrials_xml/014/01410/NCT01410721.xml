	<brief_title>Neural Markers Rehabilitation Executive Functioning Veterans With Traumatic Brain Injury Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : It estimate half military service member combat-related traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) also meet criterion Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . TBI PTSD characterize deficit multiple cognitive domain , include attention , executive function , affective cognitive control . However , cognitive affective sequela associate TBI compound presence PTSD symptom return veteran . Specifically , show significant frontal lobe dysfunction , particularly disinhibition , occurs often among veteran TBI PTSD among veteran diagnose one condition . The combination TBI PTSD veteran also link problem anger violence , common complaint veteran seek mental health service post-deployment show predict poor treatment outcome Iraq Afghanistan veteran . Executive dysfunction , especially difficulty attentional processing , strongly relate hostility aggressiveness Iraq Afghanistan veteran ; increasingly presence TBI PTSD . Objective/Hypothesis : Although relationship combine TBI/PTSD diagnose post-deployment adjustment problem clearly demonstrate , little empirical research clinical intervention design reduce severity cognitive affective symptom veteran TBI PTSD . Therefore , investigator propose conduct randomize trial theoretically base cognitive rehabilitation improve executive function affective control among Iraq Afghanistan veteran TBI PTSD , measure clinical outcome use comprehensive array functional structural method . The investigator hypothesize improved executive function among experimental group well reduce irritability/impulsivity improve social/occupational functioning . The investigator hypothesize , group , veterans participate cognitive rehabilitation program show significant change neural activity associate executive function compare pre- post-treatment EEG fMRI response . Specific Aims : Better understand neural circuitry neurocognitive function underlie executive function associate affective control deficit veteran TBI PTSD , relate treatment outcome , allow u good identify therapeutic target cognitive rehabilitation . The current proposal aim explore relationship brain function connectivity selective pathways/circuits , neuropsychological functioning , cognitive rehabilitation response veteran TBI PTSD . Study Design : Toward end , investigator propose randomized clinical trial involve cognitive rehabilitation intervention target improve executive functioning , participation N=100 veteran diagnose TBI PTSD ( n=50 experimental group n=50 receive usual care ) . As part study , participant receive iPod touch . Participants place one two study group randomly . Based group participant place , receive one two different set iPod touch apps program address aim improve different facet cognitive functioning . Regardless group , Veterans instruct daily practice iPod touch application cognitive functioning . Also , family member train `` mentor '' reinforce use application everyday live environment . Trained facilitator also travel participant ' home meet veteran family review respective application mentor process . The investigator examine cognitive behavioral change , well neural change associate cognitive rehabilitation use EEG fMRI baseline six month . Military Benefit : This study neurobiology neuropsychology associate intervention efficacy allow u identify veteran TBI PTSD predispose positive treatment outcome . To knowledge , first attempt integrate neurobiological neurocognitive technique information efficacy theoretically empirically driven cognitive rehabilitation intervention veteran combine TBI/PTSD diagnose . This research may suggest additional avenue assessment clinical intervention efficacy identification therapeutic target ( e.g . alteration function fronto-limbic circuit ) relevant military population . Given link TBI/PTSD , executive dysfunction , anger , impulsivity , aggression , effort rehabilitate cognitive function particularly important ensure current future veteran adjust successfully return home family , workplace , community .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>OIF/OEF Veteran inclusion criterion include : 1. serve one military branch ( Army , Navy , Marines , Air Force , National Guard ) ; 2. age 18 65 ; 3. serve Iraq Afghanistan War since October 2001 ; 4. screen positive TBI PTSD prior baseline interview . Definition TBI : The American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine ( ACRM ) ( Kay et al. , 1993 ) , Center Disease Control ( CDC , 2003 ) , Military TBI Task Force ( http : //www.div40.org/pdf/Military_TBI.pdf ) seek define criterion different type head injury . In current DoD application , research registry prescreening , criterion TBI define veteran : 1. report military service , head hurt/injured way cause problem ; AND 2. endorses least one following : loss consciousness get `` knock . '' immediately injury upon regain consciousness , daze `` see star . '' immediately injury upon regain consciousness , unable recall event . one hour injury veteran start remember new thing . need brain surgery injury . Definition PTSD : For purpose current research , use Diagnostic Statistical ManualIVTD ( DSMIVTR ) definition PTSD purpose current research . Specifically , subject must report traumatic event accord DSM criterion report experience reexperiencing , avoidance , hyperarousal symptom qualify diagnosis . Study registries define PTSD score cutoff 60 Clinical Assessment PTSD ( CAPS ) . We rescreen potential participant enrollment administer PTSD Checklist , score 50 indicative PTSD among OIF/OEF veteran . Please note CAPS administer part main clinical interview veteran sign informed consent . Family member inclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) family member/friend serve one military branch ( Army , Navy , Marines , Air Force , National Guard ) ; ( 2 ) age 1865 ; ( 3 ) family member serve least one tour Iraq Afghanistan since October 2001 meet criteria Inclusion Women Minorities Study : It anticipate distribution sample gender race/ethnicity reflect client population serve North Carolina healthcare system . No one exclude study gender racial/ethnic group . Since MRI session part study , subject participant : 1 . They foreign metal object implant body determine safety questionnaire . 2 . Veteran woman pregnant unwilling take pregnancy test .</criteria>
