The primary goal pilot study ass feasibility partnership Senior Services Forsyth County address vitamin D insufficiency home-bound older adult receive home-delivered meal . The investigator accomplish goal conduct 5-month randomize , control trial 200 old Meals-on-Wheels ( MOW ) recipient randomize receive monthly either ( 1 ) 100,000 IU vitamin D3 ( 2 ) active placebo ( vitamin E ) achieve follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Determine prevalence fall risk vitamin D insufficiency 200 MOW recipient . Aim 2 : Assess feasibility vitamin D intervention deliver MOW program . Aim 3 : Obtain preliminary data effectiveness intervention improve vitamin D status reduce fall . Data pilot study : 1 ) provide estimate prevalence fall vitamin D insufficiency home-bound older adult participate Forsyth County MOW program ; 2 ) provide estimate participant compliance drop-out vitamin supplementation trial deliver part MOW program ; 3 ) provide evidence efficacy vitamin D dose propose remediate vitamin D insufficiency ; 4 ) provide preliminary data potential benefit vitamin D supplementation fall home-bound old population .</detailed_description>
