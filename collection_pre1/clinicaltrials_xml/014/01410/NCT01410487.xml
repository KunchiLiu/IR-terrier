	<brief_summary>Obesity medical problem epidemic proportion associate high mortality . Obesity significant effect cardiovascular system , produce structural cardiovascular change include myocardial hypertrophy , fatty infiltration , fibrosis ; diastolic systolic dysfunction ; change pulmonary artery compliance ; increase aortic stiffness - lead heart failure . Indeed , evidence suggest obesity increase risk heart disease independent know risk factor coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , obstructive sleep apnea . Obesity also cause significant change pulmonary function , include decrease expiratory reserve volume functional residual capacity closure peripheral airway . The exact mechanism development cardiopulmonary disease well understood - pathophysiology complex likely multifactorial , relate altered hemodynamic load , alter metabolic activity , underlie inflammation , increase cardiac output . Newer diagnostic modality available institution cardiac MRI pulmonary function test impulse oscillometry allow u good evaluate cardiopulmonary dysfunction patient severe obesity . Cardiac MRI especially promise non-invasive imaging modality obese individual , provide reproducible measurement cardiac vascular anatomy function relative echocardiography . Similarly , pulmonary function test impulse oscillometry sensitive detection abnormality distal airway especially spirometry normal , frequently occur severely obese symptomatic patient . The main objective propose study evaluate effect obesity quality life health care utilization relationship cardiopulmonary disease ethnically diverse , underserved obese population use state-of-the-art diagnostic modality significant ( 20 % ) weight loss . The investigator propose perform stress cardiac MRI pulmonary function test oscillometry significant surgical weight loss 150 severely obese patient cardiopulmonary symptom . Patients evaluate comprehensive Obesity Center Bellevue Hospital meet NIH Consensus Guidelines Bariatric Surgery , cardiopulmonary symptom , meet clinical criterion cardiac stress test pulmonary function test approach study personnel offer enrollment . Informed consent obtain . Enrolled patient undergo clinical evaluation detail medical history include Borg dyspnea scale , physical examination , laboratory test include cardiopulmonary biomarkers ( brain natriuretic peptide , C-reactive protein , atrial natriuretic peptide ) , non-invasive cardiovascular stress MRI pulmonary physiologic evaluation include spirometry , plethysmography impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) . Patients active smoke history and/or asthma identify clinically . Cardiovascular MRI perform use 1.5T ( Avanto Espree , Siemens Healthcare ) system . Standard cardiovascular technique use assessment myocardial vascular structure function , include T1-weighted , T2-weighted , late gadolinium enhancement , cine , tag phase contrast imaging select plane . Adenosine stress MRI perform evaluation underlie coronary artery microvascular disease .</brief_summary>
