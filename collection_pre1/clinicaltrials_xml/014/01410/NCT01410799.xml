	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect naturally occur hormone , call Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone ( GHRH ) muscle , bone , fat tissue body . GHRH stimulate production growth hormone ( GH ) , regulate build many tissue body , include muscle bone . Many elderly people low level GH . The overall goal research determine efficacy GHRH raise level GH improve body tissue . Healthy men woman age 65 old receive GHRH four dose nightly 12 week assess change muscle strength , body mass , physical performance , body use sugar .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although multiple factor appear associate functional deterioration advance age , decrease muscle mass strength ( sarcopenia ) commonly see age subject major risk factor subsequent disability . There many potential cause sarcopenia functional impairment elderly , include medical condition cardiovascular disease , alter mood , sedentary lifestyle . Hyposomatotropism , decrease activity growth hormone ( GH ) , one factor implicate . GH major anabolic hormone exerts important stimulatory effect protein synthesis . Many peripheral tissue effect GH mediate insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) produce systemically liver locally tissue response GH stimulation . IGF-1 , turn , regulate GH secretion negative feedback mechanism pituitary gland . Several investigator show age associated decrease spontaneous GH secretion IGF-1 level . GH level decline 14 % decade puberty . Reduction GH release age think associated increase somatostatin tone , decrease hypothalmic GHRH output , diminish response GHRH . The fact age accompanied decrease protein synthesis leading loss lean body mass gain body fat suggest decrease GH secretion may contribute change . It hypothesize restoration GH level elderly level observe young individual may lead improvement body composition . GH may also increase slow wave ( delta deep ) sleep old adult .</detailed_description>
