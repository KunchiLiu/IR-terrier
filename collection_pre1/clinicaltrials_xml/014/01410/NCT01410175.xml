	<detailed_description>Introduction Surgical site infection ( SSI ) second common hospital infection , despite advance prevention achieve . However , among surgical patient , hospital infection great incidence . In United States , estimate around 500,000 case SSI occur every year , thus generate annual cost 1.6 billion dollar . According Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) , SSI appear 30 day perform surgical procedure one year afterwards , prosthesis implant . SSI classify superficial infection affect skin subcutaneous tissue incision site . It classify deep infection involve deep structure wall muscle layer organ space part anatomy open manipulated surgical procedure , exception incision . SSI series consequence . These include increased duration hospitalization , increase cost medical hospital care , increase prescription broad-spectrum antibiotic ( consequent increase bacterial resistance ) increase postoperative mortality , give 30 % 40 % deaths period result type infection . The risk factor frequently correlate SSI connection patient surgical procedure include obesity , malnutrition , smoking , age extreme , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , immunosuppression , alcoholism , use corticoid , potential contamination operative wound , long-duration operation , presence foreign body surgical site , incorrect administration antibiotic prophylaxis poor surgical technique . Thus , risk SSI may vary accord type surgery individual 's inherent condition . With regard surgical technique , point need take consideration include careful dissection manipulation tissue minimize tissue trauma , adequacy hemostasis impede formation hematoma , avoidance environment favorable microbe proliferation excessive use electric scalpel use higher-than recommended current , high potential tissue devitalization . According Fernàndes , experimental study demonstrate incorrect use electric scalpel may double rate SSI electrocauterization . Because lack solid data literature , relation impact SSI use electric scalpel make incision skin subcutaneous tissue , judge opportune conduct present study . Objectives : - To compare incidence SSI complication operative wound among patient undergo elective abdominal gynecological surgery Barretos Cancer Hospital , use electric cold scalpel . - To identify incidence SSI complication operative wound among patient undergo elective abdominal gynecological surgery , use electric scalpel skin incision subcutaneous incision . - To identify main risk factor SSI among patient undergo elective abdominal gynecological surgery . Methodology : This blind randomized clinical trial compose two group ( cold scalpel versus electric scalpel ) , among patient undergo elective abdominal gynecological surgery Barretos Cancer Hospital July 2010 July 2012 . These patient fulfill follow inclusion criterion : 18 year age , agreement participate study undergo elective abdominal gynecological surgery purpose diagnosis curative palliative oncological treatment . The following type patient exclude : patient undergo surgery manipulation digestive system , patient undergo surgery open stoma case reoperation . The randomization perform time surgery Research Support Center Barretos Cancer Hospital , subdivision patient two group , body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 30 ≥ 30 . The cold scalpel electric scalpel use accordance randomization , open skin subcutaneous cellular tissue . The aponeurosis peritoneum incise use electric scalpel . The data gather investigator , make direct observation operative wound order make diagnosis SSI discharge hospital , assessments 14th 30th day operation . The present project approve Research Ethics Committee Barretos Cancer Hospital . Subjects agree participate show acceptance sign free informed consent statement . Other factor hematoma , seroma , bulge , etc. , also evaluate .</detailed_description>
