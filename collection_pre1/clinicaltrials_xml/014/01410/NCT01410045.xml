	<detailed_description>Turner syndrome ( TS ) characterize absence part normal second X chromosome occur 1/2,500 live-born girl . Spontaneous fertility rare among patient TS related premature apoptosis ovarian follicle . Spontaneous puberty fertility report mostly patient mosaic karyotype small X deletion . There robust evidence follicle observe ovary girl TS . However , follicular density quality seem largely influenced karyotype , ovarian morphology endocrine competence . There clear-cut clinical hormonal marker assess ovarian reserve girl TS marker ovarian function use woman premature ovarian insufficiency measure . In TS , fundamental able evaluate prognosis ovarian function degree fertility provide relevant information girl parent discuss possibility motherhood . Ovarian cryopreservation use effort preserve fertility patient undergo treatment lead premature severe ovarian insufficiency . This study aim assess relevance ovarian tissue cryopreservation girl Turner syndrome . Based ovarian follicular density primary outcome karyotypic , clinical hormonal marker secondary outcome , analysis study allow screen patient procedure would benefit . Girls operate accept come follow-up visit one 12 month surgery . It expect clinical hormonal information long follow perform referred paediatrician . Results study allow u select patient TS benefit fertility preservation procedure base karyotypic , clinical hormonal profile .</detailed_description>
