	<brief_title>Progression Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis common cardiovascular disease account great number death . Atherosclerotic disease start early age follow subclinical course decade , become apparent fifth sixth decade life men approximately 10 year later woman . Its main clinical sign include myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , sudden death , stroke . Disease occurrence progression condition presence so-called risk factor : smoking , dyslipidemia , hypertension , diabetes , among others . From factor , number equation develop predict risk individual suffer disease , order apply adequate prevention measure lifestyle change drug treatment . However , despite proven efficacy intervention , cardiovascular prevention many limitation due three significant problem : 1 . The ability predict risk current equation limit genetic environmental factor may influence course disease still unknown . 2 . The ability early prediction cardiovascular risk current equation even limit individual 55 year age . 3 . Atherosclerotic disease diagnose late , usually condition advanced lesion already irreversible , cause clinical sign event organs territory vascularize diseased artery . Clinical procedure currently use detection myocardial ischemia however poorly sensitive specific asymptomatic general population . Technological advance make past decade laboratory test medical imaging open new expectation detection treatment atherosclerotic disease . Current research focus two aspect : 1 . To improve ability predict disease incorporate risk factor obtain laboratory C-reactive protein , homocysteine , fibrinogen , myeloperoxidase , lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 . At time , development genetics new so-called `` omics '' technique allow explore genetic variability individual contribution development disease complication . Such technology include genomics , epigenetics , transcriptomics , proteomics , metabolomics . 2 . To detect disease early stage use advanced imaging technique , may use minimal risk large population group . Use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) without contrast , compute tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) allow identify subclinical lesion , also study mechanisms disease monitoring course . Very population study make combine use procedure available . The actual potential approach impact may early diagnosis subclinical atherosclerosis , progression , relationship risk factor assess date .</detailed_description>
