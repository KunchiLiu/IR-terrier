	<brief_title>Occult Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Non-cardioembolic Ischemic Stroke Determined Mechanism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit wear outpatient mobile cardiac monitoring device detection atrial fibrillation patient history stroke know case . Their study treatment intervention , observational trial . Eligible patient must &gt; 50 year old , history ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack document brain infarction within prior 12 month . If patient anticoagulation therapy , eligible enrollment long-term strategy stroke prevention anti-platelet therapy oral anti-coagulant . Patients must detection AF must successfully activate lifeStar device enrollment . At end three week , LifeStar device over-read scored presence AF clinically significant arrhythmia study electrophysiologist , determine occurrence burden AF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 50 2 . Ischemic stroke , transient ischemic attack document acute brain infarction , within prior 6 month . 3 . Patient merit indefinite oral anticoagulation . ( Patients require temporary OAC purpose recurrent stroke prevention , treatment deep venous thrombosis , eligible enrollment longterm secondary stroke preventive strategy antiplatelet therapy OAC ) . 4 . Stroke mechanism determine lacunar stroke , large vessel intracranial atherosclerosis , large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis , combination thereof . 5 . Patient evaluate least 12 lead EKG least one day inpatient outpatient cardiac telemetry , detection AF atrial flutter . 6 . Detection AF atrial flutter would change secondary prevention antithrombotic strategy ( eg indefinite OAC ) . 7 . Patient receives successfully activate LifeStar ACT device . 8 . Patient legally authorize representative sign inform consent . 1 . Known history AF atrial flutter . 2 . Patient defibrillator pacemaker capable detect AF . 3 . Patient indication indefinite OAC . 4 . Patient indefinite contraindication OAC . ( Patients temporary ineligibility OAC , example due need invasive medical procedure large acute brain infarction , eligible enrollment ) . 5 . Stroke due know cause list inclusion criterion 4 . 6 . Cardioembolic stroke . 7 . Inability comply LifeStar ACT monitor regimen .</criteria>
