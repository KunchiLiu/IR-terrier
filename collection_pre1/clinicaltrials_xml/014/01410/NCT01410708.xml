	<brief_title>TORI 104 Pre-Surgical Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate molecular change occur human breast cancer tissue short-term exposure dasatinib . Secondary Objectives : `` To evaluate molecular effect short term dasatinib exposure peripheral blood SRC ( oncogene ) EPHA2 signal pathway non-tumor cell ( peripheral blood ) . `` To correlate pharmacokinetic parameter molecular change detect breast cancer tissue peripheral blood `` To evaluate tolerability safety short-term exposure daily dose 100 mg twice daily dasatinib administration Study Design : Eligible patient register receive dasatinib 100 mg orally twice daily start within 8 day time registration continue time definitive surgery . Duration Treatment `` No 8 day elapse time registration time first dose dasatinib `` No 28 day elapse time initial diagnosis time first dose dasatinib `` Minimum duration treatment dasatinib 14 day minimum 10 consecutive day treatment immediately prior definitive surgery `` Dasatinib shall administer day prior definitive surgery `` No 45 day elapse time initial diagnosis time definitive surgery i.e . maximum duration treatment dasatinib 45 day . Core Biopsies : Tumor sample must collect time initial diagnosis ( subsequent procedure ) either core needle incisional biopsy . Excisional biopsy allow . A minimum 4 core biopsy ( equivalent incisional biopsy ) require perform molecular analysis . Once core biopsy remove , sample must immediately snap-frozen , store liquid nitrogen -70 -80 C site . Samples ship UCLA laboratory within 30 day collection . Tumor Tissue time Definitive Surgery : A second tumor sample ( post-dasatinib ) must collect time patient 's surgery manner . Unstained paraffin slide : While analysis perform frozen tissue , molecular testing may require paraffin embed tissue . The pathology department ask send 4 , 5 micron thick , unstained paraffin slide pretreatment ( diagnosis biopsy ) definitive surgery ( 8 slide total ) Definitive Surgery : The type definitive surgery perform accord institution 's guideline . In event sentinel node biopsy procedure perform , dye injected tumor bed tumor removal . The dye inject tumor may alter tissue affect molecular analysis . Pharmacokinetic plasma sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collect follow time point ( 5 sample ) : 1 . Baseline , prior first dose dasatinib . Timing collection : anytime registration first dose dasatinib . 2 . Last day dasatinib ( = day prior surgery ) Timing Collection : patient ask come clinic take last morning dose dasatinib . Blood drawn immediately prior take tablet clinic . 3 . Last day dasatinib ( = day prior surgery ) Timing Collection : 2-3 hour last morning dose 4 . Last day dasatinib ( = day prior surgery ) Timing Collection : 6-8m hour last morning dose 5 . On day surgery Timing Collection : close possible surgery ( +/- 1 hour ) Patients request document date time dose consume well detail concern drug holiday patient diary . Samples patient require relatively large variability dasatinib pharmacokinetics ( interpatient coefficient variation approximately 65 % ) The sample centrifuge , process , ship . Results pharmacokinetics analysis correlate molecular data . Number Patients : 60 evaluable patient Statistical Analysis : The primary objective trial evaluate molecular change occur breast cancer tissue follow short-term dasatinib administration . Based pre-clinical data support role Src `` triple-negative '' breast cancer , study aim 50 % evaluable patient subtype define negative ER , PR , HER2 amplification . In case HER2 amplification determine FISH diagnosis , HER2 stain IHC 0 1+ consider negative enrolment purpose . After 30 , 40 , 50 evaluable patient accrue , enrolment may adjust reach goal 30 triple-negative patient . Descriptive statistic use compare pre- post-treatment molecular finding . A statistical Analysis Plan ( SAO ) finalize late prior database lock analysis detail provide SAP . Descriptive statistic use describe incidence adverse event toxicity , well number patient study medication permanently stop . Stopping Rules : Enrolment complete accord protocol plan sample size , assessment requirement complete per protocol , state objective trial achieve , recommendation DMC . Patients may withdraw trial time request , may withdraw time discretion investigator sponsor continuation study would detrimental patient 's well , objective disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , noncompliance , second primary malignancy , logistical consideration</detailed_description>
