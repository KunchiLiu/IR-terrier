	<brief_summary>Puberty represent critical period term metabolic health . Racial difference insulin dynamic , reproductive maturation , associate endocrine change may affect female 's health later life . Further , peripubertal period likely period racial divergence adiposity note European American ( EA ) African American ( AA ) girl . Diet major modifiable risk factor . The identification simple , cost-effective dietary strategy prevention management metabolic disease excess fat mass accrual peripubertal period priority . Modification diet affect metabolic endocrine outcome without weight loss pubertal transition represent novel approach pediatric obesity epidemic . It likely two diet use project different metabolic effect , include effect postprandial glycemia , triglyceride concentration , free fatty acid concentration , satiety . These factor may turn , affect development metabolic perturbation , especially susceptible individual ( e.g . AA peripubertal girl ) .The role carbohydrate metabolic outcome , particularly among child , receive little attention . It hypothesize higher postprandial glycemia may mechanism disease progression . Development diet reduces insulin secretion optimize metabolic-endocrine health among peripubertal girl likely reduce obesity relate co-morbidities future reliance pharmacologic treatment , even absence weight loss . However , light current trend pediatric obesity , safe effective regimen also promote weight loss need pediatric population . This proposal significant shed light whether diet composition , part eucaloric ( weight-stable ) hypocaloric diet ( weight-loss ) influence hyperinsulinemic characteristic AA peripubertal girl . Existing data suggest elevate concentration insulin and/or reproductive hormone may contribute fat mass accrual AA could elevate risk development chronic disease adulthood . The result study lead development dietary mean reduction insulin , thereby prevention pediatric obesity type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Puberty Related Intervention Improve Metabolic Outcomes ( The PRIMO Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include 100 European African American girl age 7-11 year . Subjects must non-diabetic overweight ( percentile BMI &gt; 85th ) . Screening First complete telephone questionnaire regard medical history current lifestyle ( approximately 15 minute ) . If subject deem eligible base telephone screening , come UAB orientation meeting . At time subject ' height weight record . They receive copy study assent/consent form review entire protocol select study personnel ( approximately 60 minute ) . Protocol Run-In Phase With parental guidance , subject complete 4-day food record assessment typical nutrient intake ( attach ) prior begin run-in diet . The 4-day food record analyze registered dietitian use Minnesota Nutrition Data System . Then subject provide food 3 day . This diet similar standard `` American '' diet , intend eliminate inter-subject variance metabolic outcome due free-living dietary factor . The total energy diet calculate eucaloric body weight maintain , determine use Harris-Benedict equation activity factor 1.35 . In previous ongoing study UAB CRU , method result maintenance body mass . Subjects come UAB weigh pick meal . All meal package home consumption . Upon completion Run-in Phase , subject report CRU Outpatient facility metabolic test WEBB Boshell building body composition assessment . The test administer describe . Phase 1 Weeks 1-6 . Subjects randomize control eucaloric reduced-CHO ( SPEC ) control eucaloric standard ( STAN ) diet . Subjects come UAB two day week morning ( Monday-Friday ) weigh collect food meal . Energy need estimate qualified dietitian use standard equation . All food diet intervention provide study . Body weight recorded ensure weight maintenance . Energy intake adjust necessary maintain body weight . Upon completion , subject report CRU Outpatient facility metabolic test WEBB building body composition assessment . The test administer described chart . One morning , approximately midpoint phase 1 , subject ask come CRU undergo solid meal test . This test measure hormonal glycemic response consume breakfast provide part study . The detail test outline . Phase 2 Weeks 7-18 . Subjects continue assign diet group ( i.e . SPEC STAN ) , receive control hypocaloric diet design facilitate weight loss . Subjects report UAB two weekday morning weigh collect food meal . Energy need estimate qualified dietitian . All food diet intervention provide study . Body weight record two time weekly monitor weight loss . Upon completion phase 2 , subject report CRU Outpatient facility metabolic test WEBB building body composition assessment . The test administer described chart . Education Counseling Sessions At time completion Phase 2 , study participant initiate series education counsel session design allow continue assign diet free-living situation ensue 6 week . The goal phase maintenance weight loss occur formal intervention . Subjects attend group meeting 6-week follow-up phase . These meeting occur weekly week 19-22 , bi-weekly week 23-25 . The periodic education counsel session serve reinforce diet guideline , evaluate problem arise . Phase 3 Weeks 19-25 subject `` free-living phase . '' During week 19-25 , dietitian periodically administer unannounced 24-hour diet recall telephone . This involve subject report food consume previous day . At end Phase 3 subject receive DXA scan rest energy expenditure assess .</detailed_description>
