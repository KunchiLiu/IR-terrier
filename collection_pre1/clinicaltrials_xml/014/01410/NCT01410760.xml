	<brief_summary>The PERFORM study pilot study investigate feasibility usefulness perform novel CT ( Computed Tomography ) scanning technique call Perfusion CT ( CTP ) addition normal CT scanning patient recruit FOXFIRE trial . All patient recruit FOXFIRE Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals University Hospitals Leicester invite take part . FOXFIRE national randomise controlled trial patient unresectable liver tumour secondary colorectal cancer receive treatment standard chemotherapy alone , chemotherapy combination internal radiotherapy treatment delivers radioactive particle ( SIR-spheres ) liver via blood supply ( radioembolisation ) . In FOXFIRE study normal CT scan would usually perform prior start treatment also three month commencement treatment ass cancer 's response treatment , particularly whether tumour change size result treatment . Perfusion CT give normal information change tumour size also assess whether blood flow cancer change , may allow early identification treatment success compare normal CT scan . All patient consent participate PERFORM study undergo four perfusion CT scan : one treatment start , one start second , third fifth cycle chemotherapy . The aim determine feasibility measure tumour perfusion data analysis use perfusion CT establish tumour perfusion pattern baseline shortly start therapy predict response radioembolisation chemotherapy . This research fund National Institute Health Research Biomedical Research Centre Oxford Oxfordshire Health Services Research Committee .</brief_summary>
