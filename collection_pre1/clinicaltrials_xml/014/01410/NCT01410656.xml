	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine effect implementation intention intervention physical activity ( PA ) behaviour prostate cancer survivor . Secondary aim ( ) compare effect telephone-assisted implementation intention intervention self-administered implementation intention intervention standard recommendation group physical activity behaviour ( b ) document effect intervention quality life ( QoL ) , fatigue , symptom management , physical functioning . Hypotheses : Evidence exist implementation intention intervention lead significant improvement PA level regular PA show improve QoL , fatigue level , manage symptom improve physical functioning cancer survivor ' . As , follow hypothesis generate : ( 1 ) prostate cancer survivor expose researcher-assisted implementation intention intervention high PA level 1- 3-month follow-up compare self-completed implementation intention intervention standard recommendation group ; ( 2 ) prostate cancer survivor researcher-assisted implementation intention intervention show significant improvement QoL , fatigue level , symptom management , physical functioning compare self-completed implementation intention intervention standard recommendation group 1- 3-month follow-up ; ( 3 ) prostate cancer survivor self-completed implementation intention intervention high PA level , good improvement QoL , fatigue level , symptom management , physical functioning compare standard recommendation group 1- 3-month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prostate cancer remain frequently diagnose cancer among Canadian men , estimate 24,600 men diagnosed 2010 . In Alberta specifically , roughly 2,500 men diagnose prostate cancer , 440 men die disease 2010 ( Canadian Cancer Society , 2011 ) . Improvements treatment prostate cancer reduce tumour growth improve survival rate , however , also associate significant negative change cancer survivor ' quality life , physical functioning , body fat percentage fatigue level may persist year follow treatment . One behavioural strategy consistently show combat negative side effect enhance psychosocial physical well-being prostate cancer survivor physical activity . Unfortunately establish physical activity level decline significantly pre-diagnosis treatment may never regain pre-diagnosis level ; thus important test novel , innovative inexpensive way increase physical activity pattern prostate cancer survivor . PURPOSE : The primary purpose study determine effect implementation intention intervention physical activity behaviour prostate cancer survivor . Secondary aim ( ) compare effect telephone-assisted implementation intention intervention self-administered implementation intention intervention standard recommendation group physical activity behaviour ( b ) document effect intervention quality life , fatigue , symptom management , physical functioning . METHODS : A three-arm randomized control trial prostate cancer survivor perform Alberta Cancer Registry . To obtain sample least 300 participant , 1500 prostate cancer survivor contact initial mail-out . Following initial mail-out prostate cancer survivor agree participate study randomize one three condition . All group receive write physical activity recommendation , well 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines . In addition physical activity material , participant telephone-assisted self-administered group ask complete implementation intention intervention . Finally , telephone-assisted group receive 10-20 minute telephone call assist completion implementation intention intervention . Measures baseline ( i.e. , initial mail-out ) include self-reported physical activity , demographic , health medical factor , quality life , fatigue , physical functioning . Follow-up month 1 3 follow intervention include self-reported physical activity , quality life , fatigue physical function measure . SUMMARY : This mail-out study offer insight effect implementation intention intervention physical activity level understudied cancer population , explore effect physical activity part usual care recommend treatment prostate cancer quality life , fatigue symptom management .</detailed_description>
