	<brief_summary>A research study new method visualize internal organ call 18F-FLT PET/CT yield well track cancer treatment progress . PET/CT stand positron emission tomography low dose compute tomography use many year . 18F-FLT PET/CT use new tracer , fluorothymidine , take cell actively proliferate divide cancer cell . We hope learn whether tracer superior conventional tracer monitoring treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLT-PET/CT v FDG-PET/CT Therapy Monitoring Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-Primary Objective Investigate whether PPV FLT-PET/CT significantly high FDG-PET/CT follow patient least 24 month post-therapy evidence persistent disease/disease progression . -Secondary Objectives Investigate whether event free survival ( EFS ) patient FDG-PET/CT-positive FLT-PET/CT negative scan significantly low patient concordantly negative FDG-PET/CT FLT-PET/CT scan NPV FLT-PET/CT similar FDG-PET/CT Correlate interim FLT-PET/CT FDG-PET/CT International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) , well-established predictor outcome DLBCL , determine independent prognostic value IPI</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must histologic cytological diagnosis de novo DLBCL schedule receive first line chemotherapy RCHOP give every 21 day ( RCHOP21 ) within 6 week enrollment 6 cycle . Patients must &gt; =18 year age , discrimination base gender , race , creed , ethnic background . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must sign informed consent , mentally responsible . Subjects significant concurrent medical complication judgment Principal Investigator ( ) could affect patient 's ability complete plan trial , include multiple imaging study . Patients history prior lymphoma ( e.g. , follicular lymphoma ) and/or second cancer basal cell carcinoma . Patients plan treat RCHOP14 ( i.e. , RCHOP give every 14 day ) exclude ( extremely rare , , since RCHOP21 standard treatment . Patients schedule receive Rituxan therapy ( e.g. , XRT , radioimmunotherapy ) adjuvant therapy completion RCHOP21 . Pregnant woman exclude . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) study entry duration study participation . The effect FLT develop human fetus unknown . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A screening urine human chorionic gonadtropin ( hCG ) ( pregnancy test ) administer Nuclear Medicine woman childbearing potential FLT scan pregnant woman stop participate study .</criteria>
