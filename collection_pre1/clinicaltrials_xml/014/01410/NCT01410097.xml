	<brief_summary>Obesity associate physical disability direct pathway ( e.g. , low extremity pain , insufficient muscle strength ) indirect pathway ( obesity-related comorbidities inflammation ) . Furthermore , diabetes , major obesity-related health condition , associate increase risk disability accelerate decline physical cognitive function . The investigator preliminary data suggest intentional weight loss improve physical function , strong circumstantial evidence would also benefit cognitive function . To evaluate role intentional weight loss physical cognitive function , investigator propose ancillary study on-going Look AHEAD ( Action Health Diabetes ) trial . Look AHEAD multi-center , randomize clinical trial examine effect 4-year lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss decrease caloric intake exercise overweight obese men woman age 45-74 year type 2 diabetes . The investigator propose add validate well-established measure physical cognitive performance year 8 follow-up visit - trial 's weight maintenance phase - ~1000 participant 4 16 Look AHEAD field site ( Colorado , Memphis , Pennington Pittsburgh ) . The specific aim ancillary study : 1 ) To determine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss physical function ; 2 ) To determine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss cognitive function . In addition , investigator hypothesize intervention group , large initial weight loss , good weight loss maintenance , high physical activity associate well physical cognitive function . The investigator also hypothesize control group weight loss associate bad physical cognitive function weight stable gained weight . The number obese old adult rise rapidly data guide evidence-based clinical response management . The result study provide first direct evidence role long-term intentional weight loss maintenance physical cognitive function older obese adult diabetes . Since study do ancillary study on-going trial do timely cost-efficient manner .</brief_summary>
