	<brief_title>A Feasibility Safety Study Vaccination With Poly-ICLC Peptide-pulsed Dendritic Cells Patients With Metastatic , Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Recurrent Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . Assess safety treatment evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity group patient . 2 . Determine feasibility generate dendritic cell administer cell vaccine patient . Secondary Objectives 1 . Assess anti-tumor activity vaccination , measure change tumor burden overall survival . 2 . Assess immunological response vaccination ( antigen-specific T cell cytokine production , antigen-specific T cell frequency tetramer analysis , DTH reaction )</detailed_description>
