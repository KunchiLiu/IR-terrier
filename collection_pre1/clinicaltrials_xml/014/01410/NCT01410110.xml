The active intervention 13 week . CRT comprise repetitive training hierarchy progressive visual auditory exercise Positscience . WT involve pay work activity placement choose medical center campus .

These include substance abuse , cognitive , psychosocial outcomes well adherence treatment . During 3 month active intervention participant weekly observe urine toxicology screen , breathalyzer test PDA assessment , well monthly work performance evaluation .
