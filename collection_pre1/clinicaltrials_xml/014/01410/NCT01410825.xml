	<brief_summary>The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) inherit disorder result defect blood bone marrow . It affect boys genetic mistake carry X chromosome . Normal people blood cell call platelet stop bleed blood vessel damage . Boys WAS low number platelet function correctly . Boys WAS thus risk severe life-threatening bleeding . A normal immune system make special blood cell call white blood cell , protect infection also fight certain type cancer . In WAS , white blood cell n't work well , make boy susceptible infection form blood cancer know lymphoma . The abnormal white blood cell patient WAS also cause disease eczema arthritis . Although WAS mild , severe form need treatment early possible prevent life-threatening complication due bleeding , infection blood cancer . Over past decade , investigator develop new treatment base investigator knowledge defective gene causing WAS . The investigator use gene type medicine correct problem patient 's bone marrow . The investigator call process gene transfer . The procedure similar normal bone marrow transplant , old marrow kill use chemotherapy , different patient 's bone marrow give back treat gene transfer . This approach use even patient match donor available avoid problem GVHD rejection . The investigator wish test whether approach safe whether gene transfer lead development healthy immune blood system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Feasibility Study Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Transfer Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) ( OMIM 301000 ) rare X-linked immunodeficiency cause mutation single gene , WAS , map Xp11.22-Xp11.3 cod Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) 1 . WASP critical regulator actin signal expression limit hematopoietic cell , thus require multiple function include T cell activation , dendritic cell migration podosome formation , B cell terminal development function . WAS characterize microthrombocytopenia , recurrent infection , eczema associate high incidence auto-immunity lymphoid malignancy . Classic severe WAS , generally observe patient nonsense mutation insertions/deletions result frameshift splice-site mutation missense mutation result unstable protein 2 . With exception , WASP-negative patient classical disease . Affected patient severely reduced life expectancy . Currently , curative option WAS patient hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . This treatment successful HLA-identical sibling match unrelated donor available result correction microthrombocytopenia immune dysfunction , even stable mixed chimerism occur . However , even patient undergo matched HSCT suffer considerable morbidity mortality due graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) many patient lack HLA-identical donor . The outcome mismatch related HSCT consistently poor survival approximately 50 % . Gene transfer attractive alternative treatment WAS . Successful gene transfer use autologous gene-corrected HSC would overcome clinical complication link GVHD treatment . Furthermore , contrast allogeneic HSCT , gene transfer would limited availability compatible donor . Several line evidence indicate partial reconstitution gene correct cell may sufficient ameliorate disease . We propose Pilot Feasibility study ex vivo gene transfer use lentiviral vector ( LV ) transduce autologous bone marrow derive CD34+ HSC . Cells infused patient condition cytoreductive chemotherapy . Our collaborate investigator Europe develop LV encode human WAS cDNA control WAS promoter pseudotyped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein ( VSVg ) envelope . This w1.6_hWASP_WPRE ( VSVg ) LV ( abbreviate w1.6W ) show efficacious vitro vivo preclinical model . Safety include cellular toxicity , insertional mutagenesis tumor formation study number method include : 1 ) sensitive vitro transformation assay , 2 ) toxicity study transduce human CD34+ cell , 3 ) examination insertional pattern transduce murine cell , 4 ) long-term observation secondary transplant study mice . In United States , plan enroll 5 boy classic WAS lack match related unrelated donor . Parallel study ( Investigational New Drug application ) use LV produce facility , Genethon , conduct London , UK ( 5 subject ) Paris , France ( 5 subject ) . The primary objective demonstrate feasibility safety . The secondary objective ass therapeutic efficacy .</detailed_description>
