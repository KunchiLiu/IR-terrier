	<detailed_description>Methemoglobin abnormal hemoglobin form oxidation one four heme group hemoglobin oxygen exogenous oxidize agent . The injectable local anesthetic prilocaine routinely use medical dental profession well know inducer methemoglobin . The injectable local anesthetic lidocaine also suggest associate development methemoglobin ; however , direct evidence support claim . The concern methemoglobin dose-dependent toxin . The oxidation one iron group ferrous state ferric state alters molecular structure hemoglobin molecule impairs ability bind oxygen . This ultimately result less oxygen deliver peripheral tissue less carbon dioxide remove cause tissue hypoxia . A small amount ( 0-2 % ) methemoglobin normally present blood result oxidation hemoglobin prototypical oxidant oxygen . However , individual expose exogenous oxidize agent sufficient dosage potency , methemoglobin level rise 2 % person develop know acquired methemoglobinemia . Signs cyanosis result acquire methemoglobinemia usually become present methemoglobin blood level rise 15 % . Despite injectable local anesthetic prilocaine well know inducer methemoglobin lidocaine speculate inducer , document study trial dental literature extent amount methemoglobin form follow routine use injectable local anesthetic . This investigation examine peak blood level methemoglobin time peak level methemoglobin follow use injectable prilocaine lidocaine use dental treatment pediatric patient general anesthesia . This study population consist 90 patient , 3 6 year age , schedule undergo comprehensive dental rehabilitation general anesthesia Koppel Special Care Dentistry Center Loma Linda University School Dentistry . Following enrollment , subject randomize three equal study group : 1 ) 4 % prilocaine plain , 2 ) 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine , 3 ) No local anesthetic . All subject Masimo Radical-7 pediatric , non-disposable , pulse co-oximeter sensor place ring finger right hand follow induction general anesthesia . The sensor connect Radical-7 Pulse Co-Oximeter . The pulse co-oximeter non-invasively monitor record methemoglobin blood level 10 second interval throughout dental treatment . Following routine oral examination , radiograph , prophylaxis , subject assign Groups 1 2 administered local anesthetic restorative dental treatment . Group 1 subject receive 5mg/kg 4 % prilocaine plain Group 2 subject receive 2.5mg/kg 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine . Group 3 subject receive local anesthetic . The time local anesthetic administration baseline methemoglobin blood level record . Methemoglobin blood level monitor record throughout completion dental treatment recovery general anesthesia subject movement precludes monitoring .</detailed_description>
