	<detailed_description>SAMPLE SIZE : Sample size justification : Dr. Bertrand review 144 case treat prolotherapy , 25 fit inclusion criterion ( age 19 74 suffering arthritis shoulder frozen shoulder ) . Among patient , difference pain score prior treatment give questionnaire average 5.36 point over10 standard deviation 3.28 . Improvements baseline 6 month true placebo arm project half prolotherapy group , average 2.7 point improvement standard deviation approximately equal prolotherapy group 3.28 . In order achieve 80 % power detecting difference mean improvement , give group standard deviation 3.3 , average difference group 2.7 point 10 , group include 25 subject . RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT : Recruitment : Ads send North Shore Burnaby physician , physiotherapist , chiropractor , post Lions gate hospital ultrasound wait room North Shore recreation center . A small adwords ad refer subject website , www.prolotherapyhealing/shoulder . Consent : At initial appointment Dr. Bertrand , patient give information nature study procedure involve , include fact three treatment consist numerous shoulder injection . He also tell three monthly treatment may need achieve relief shoulder pain . If decides proceed , give copy consent form , DASH questionnaire , VAS pain scale fill . The intake assessment include socio-demographic information medical history include duration severity symptom , smoke status , arm dominance general health . If patient manifest symptoms sign rotator cuff tendinopathy last three month , exclusion criterion , schedule ultrasound x-ray examination shoulder . The radiologist rate ultrasound use USPRS . If exclusion criterion find , patient refer physiotherapist baseline assessment shoulder use ( PESS ) , schedule first treatment session . The patient tell avoid anti-inflammatory medication four week follow treatment . He give prescription Tylenol three Tramacet need pain control . RANDOM ALLOCATION OF PATIENTS , AND STUDY GROUPS : At first treatment session patient assign sequential number . A previously generate master list randomly allocate number either treatment ( A ) one two control group ( B ) , ( C ) use permute block randomization scheme . ( The pharmacist generate custody master list , use dice ensure random allocation . ) Dr. Bertrand 's file record patient 's number . The pharmacist prepare mixtures advance label patient 's number include letter C , patient receive lidocaine subcutaneously . Group A - intervention ( treatment ) group . Will receive three , monthly , prolotherapy session use mixture 25 % dextrose 0.1 % lidocaine ( 50 % dextrose mixed equal part 0.2 % lidocaine solution ( one part 1 % lidocaine mixed four part normal saline ) ) rotator cuff ligament tendon . Group B - modify prolotherapy control group . Will receive mixture 0.1 % lidocaine ( one part 1 % lidocaine mixed nine part normal saline solution ) rotator cuff ligament tendon . Group C - true control group . Will receive 0.1 % lidocaine ( one part 1 % lidocaine mixed nine part normal saline solution ) subcutaneously location . Intention treat : Patients include study receive one set injection . If , first treatment , fail keep physician appointment , secretary telephone patient administer DASH questionnaire VAS phone . She accord study timeline ( i.e . one , two , three six month follow first injection session ) . INTERVENTION PROTOCOL : Injection procedure . After patient randomize Groups A , B , C , receive three set injection ( one set per month 3 month ) . The entire shoulder area sterilize 70 % alcohol . In order decrease pain actual injection , area treat injected intradermally , use number 32G one half inch needle , mixture 1 % Xylocaine buffer equal volume sodium bicarbonate solution subject control . The intervention consist follow : For group A B , solution inject , 1 mL amount , use 27G 1½ two inch needle follow location : Supraspinatus tendon : anterior-superior part great tuberosity , tendon generally tender palpation area 2 3 cm height 1 cm width . Unless tendon tender palpation , 1 mL solution inject . All tender part tendon inject 1 cm interval , .5 mL solution , total 1 four injection . Infraspinatus tendon : immediately posterior supraspinatus tendon , line spine scapula great tuberosity . Unless tendon tender palpation , 1 mL solution inject . All tender part tendon inject 1 cm interval , .5 mL solution , total 1 four injection . Teres minor tendon : attache posterior superior surface great tuberosity . Unless tendon tender palpation , 1 mL solution inject . All tender part tendon inject 1 cm interval , .5 mL solution , total 1 four injection . Teres minor triceps insertion outer edge scapula . To avoid risk inject lung , injection make subject 's arm extreme adduction , scratch back . This bring scapula forward , distance rib cage . These area inject subject complains tenderness palpation . All tender area inject 1 cm interval , .5 mL solution , total 1 four injection . Coracoid process : insertion short tendon biceps . It bony pro-eminence clavicle medial head humerus . 1 mL solution inject area . Long tendon biceps : immediately medial acromioclavicular joint , arm slight external rotation 2 inch needle insert vertically 15° anterior tilt bone reach . 1 mL solution inject area . Subscapularis tendon : insert lesser tuberosity humerus posterior long tendon biceps . With arm full external rotation adduction , 2 inch needle insert 1 cm lateral coracoid process reach humerus . 1 mL solution inject area . Additional injection perform 1 cm 1 cm area .5 mL solution subscapularis tender palpation . Inferior glenohumeral ligament : arm externally rotate abducted 90° , 2 inch needle insert posteriorly 1 cm coracoid process inferior part glenohumeral joint reach . 1 mL insert area needle move medially laterally . Another milliliter inject two area , correspond scapular humeral insertion inferior glenohumeral ligament . 22G , 3 4 inch needle use obese subject . All needle insertion make bone reach . No injection do otherwise . At end procedure , entire shoulder joint pain free exhibit full almost full range motion . The patient warn pain free status last long local anesthetic place . The control group ( Group C ) treat respect identically group A B , follow exception : ( 1 ) receive injection 0.1 % lidocaine combine normal saline ( unlike group A ) , ( 2 ) depth injection different , subcutaneous rather inside ligament , volume solution use group A B . To assess subject truly blind treatment , ask state treatment ( true prolotherapy , modify prolotherapy , placebo , n't know ) think receive treatment , record patient 's chart database . Neither patient physiotherapist radiologist aware group patient randomize . Outcome measure assessment : At 3 treatment session , : ( 1 ) record side effect experience session follow previous injection session , ( 2 ) administer VAS pain scale , DASH ( disability arm , shoulder hand ) questionnaire prior treat . If request , patient receive prescription either Tylenol number three Tramacet deal post-treatment pain . The amount prescribe amount use record . Throughout 3-month injection intervention , subject also receive physiotherapy every 2 week . One month 3 month third set injection patient reassess physiotherapist use ( PESS ) also fill VAS pain scale answer DASH questionnaire . Finally , follow-up ultrasound ( USPRS ) administer 3 month complete injection . Nine month treatment start : follow-up telephone survey , determine whether improvement retain . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : With exception 'total amount pain medication use ' , main assessment outcome measure ( VAS , DASH , PESS , USPRS ) , base difference patient 's score first ( baseline ) visit last visit six month later . For outcome , three group compare use ANOVA . In case ANOVA indicate difference three group , subsequent comparison prolotherapy group control group carry . The overall primary assessment comparison prolotherapy group ( A ) true control group ( C ) VAS improvement baseline six month ; analyse secondary . All statistical test two-sided difference consider statistically significant p-value less 0.05 . To explore pattern treatment effect time , improvement baseline time point analyze similarly . Methods longitudinal data analysis use carry comprehensive exploratory analysis . Other variable , collect first patient visit , duration pain prior randomization , patient 's age gender , general health smoking status , whether tendinopathy affect dominant arm , severity tendinopathy influence duration intensity pain , shoulder function , ultrasound evidence healing . The relationship prognostic factor outcome measure examine . In case strong relationship apparent , analysis repeat adjustment factor . That , analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) use place ANOVA , correspond subsequent comparison prolotherapy group control group . SIGNIFICANCE : Rotator cuff tendinopathy know notoriously resistant standard therapy use NSAIDs , physiotherapy , steroid injection surgery . After three year 46 % pain-free . In experience , use prolotherapy , 75 % 50 % improve three month , time 42 % pain-free . If experience corroborate current research project , may augur radical change way rotator cuff tendinopathy treat . The material need prolotherapy ( syrinx , needle , dextrose solution local anesthetic ) inexpensive available family practitioner regardless location . The knowledge need relatively easy family physician acquire , make treatment potentially accessible even remotest rural location surgery even physiotherapy unavailable . There major nerve blood vessel area inject , risk treatment extremely low ( e.g . bruise soreness day follow injection . These complication compare favorably 10 % complication rate follow shoulder surgery , also require prolonged postoperative recovery period , , times serious , potential side effect NSAIDs corticosteroid injection . Getting people return work sooner , much less cost current therapy ( 3x $ 150 compare $ 24,300 ) would benefit healthcare system suffer problem .</detailed_description>
