	<brief_title>Pulse Pressure Variation Spontaneously Breathing Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) know dynamic indicator predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilate patient . PPV generate cardiopulmonary interaction respiratory cycle . In spontaneous breathing , cardiopulmonary interaction may lead PPV inverted manner . In study , investigator evaluate ability PPV predict fluid responsiveness spontaneously breathe patient . Before induction anesthesia , radial artery cannulation perform , FloTrac/Vigileo ( Edwards Lifesciences Corp. , Irvine , USA ) system connect . And , investigator measure baseline data include invasive blood pressure , pulse pressure , cardiac index , stroke volume variation two different condition : tidal spontaneous breathe force spontaneous breathing . All hemodynamic measurement repeat infusion fluid use 6mL/kg hydroxyethyl starch solution ( Voluven ) , average 3 minute . Patients whose cardiac index increase &gt; 15 % fluid infusion define responder . The investigator compare hemodynamic parameter responder non-responders . To evaluate ability predict volume responsiveness , receiver operate characteristic curve PPV calculate .</detailed_description>
