	<brief_summary>Despite unequivocal proof tight control blood pressure antihypertensive medication prevent hypertensive complications—including stroke , myocardial infarct , heart failure , end-stage renal disease , death— blood pressure remain uncontrolled majority individual hypertension . We propose novel patient-centered intervention combine monetary incentive social psychological intervention help patient sustain blood pressure control incentives longer offer strengthen intrinsic motivation control blood pressure among two vulnerable population : African Americans , suffer disproportionately hypertension , Mexican Americans , low hypertension control rate demographic group United States . If intervention successful , could adapt set tool apply clinical practice improve outcome range chronic disease , maximize motivation patient optimize treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monetary Incentives Intrinsic Motivation Sustain Hypertension Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose test translation behavioral economics social psychology theory experience domain intervention potential improve control hypertension diminish health impact . Blood pressure control require : ( 1 ) patient see physician ; ( 2 ) disease recognize physician , ( 3 ) medicine prescribe ; ( 4 ) patient take medicine ; ( 5 ) patient come back additional visit monitor treatment ; ( 6 ) provider make adjustment need therapy ; ( 7 ) patient adhere change continue come monitoring . Factors interfere chain event even among patient regular source care , community clinic . Due asymptomatic nature disease , lack awareness consequence uncontrolled BP , discount consequence occur distant future , health belief lead individual believe treatment would beneficial , compete demand , financial barrier , medication side effect , patient may monitor BP often , press physician BP control , adhere medication regimen . For part , physician may intensify treatment indicate . How would combination incentive propose study work hypertension management ? Monetary incentive could improve BP control lead patient monitor BP make physician visit hypertension frequently , `` activate '' patient assertive discuss treatment intensification provider BP elevate issue regard therapy , improve medication adherence . Thus patient whose BP reading continue elevate receive inadequate monotherapy level hypertension might motivate remember take pill , check reading regularly , importantly , get doctor intensify regimen face monetary incentive reduce BP . Similarly , another patient might motivate speak tell physician trouble take current BP medicine side-effects ; rather stop medication suffer consequence uncontrolled hypertension , `` activate '' patient may stimulate physician prescribe different class medicine effectively control BP without side-effects . Although experience may give patient insight get blood pressure control keep time , concern initially interfere BP control may lead patient return previous habit monetary incentive withdrawn . They may busy make time check blood pressure , refill prescription , take medicine , see doctor . For reason , help patient identify intrinsic motivation control BP necessary . Intrinsic motivation would help keep patient continually aware stake ( term people care , role society , activity ) take medicine , fill prescription , follow provider blood pressure reading target . The challenge achieve sustain hypertension control might usefully borrow terminology clinical oncology , many treatment 3 phase : induction , consolidation , maintenance . For hypertension , envision similar framework : induction normal blood pressure initiation adjustment medication adherence ( expect monetary incentive effective ) ; consolidation patient maintain normal blood pressure period time ( reinforced frequent feedback , ongoing incentive , intervention aim make intrinsic motivation salient ) ; maintenance withdrawal incentive , reinforce success reduce blood pressure couple identity prim identity label engender strong intrinsic motivation continue .</detailed_description>
