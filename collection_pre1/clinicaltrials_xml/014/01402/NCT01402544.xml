	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment Of Age-related Macular Degeneration Patients After Early Diagnosis Treatment With Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct open label , multi-center study naïve AMD patient identify early upon disease progression ( normal VA , FA OCT within 4 month prior entry ) ass treat ranibizumab monthly restore patient baseline vision pre-AMD . Recent randomize clinical trial ( MARINA , ANCHOR ) conclusively demonstrate continued intravitreal therapy ranibizumab patient subfoveal CNV AMD lead stabilization vision 90 % patient improvement vision least third patient lead approval ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg ) treatment neovascular AMD . Patients receive monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injection 12 month ( dose hold return baseline/ 20/20 good evidence fluid SD-OCT FA ) . All patient ETDRS vision SD-OCT , complete exam monthly visit . Patients blood analysis genetics ( either GALLEY study convert wet AMD enter COMPASS study ) .</detailed_description>
