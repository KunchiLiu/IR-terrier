	<brief_summary>Elastic MCT widely recognize consensus-approved treatment chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) .Efficacy evidence level often insufficient ( grade B C ) , base study carry prior CEAP classification ( 2004 ) . Item C3 classification relate patient suffer chronic venous disease permanent oedema . Literature mention one study volume reduction venous-induced oedema primary endpoint . Indeed , 240 patient show 46.7 ± 8.2 ml reduction ( SEM ) 12 week Class 2 compression sock ( 15-20 mm Hg ankle ) . Volume accurate reproducible quantitative measure consider nowadays gold standard objectify oedema variation . It therefore particularly relevant C3-patient trial ( CEAP classification ) . The main objective current study evaluate clinical effect Progressiv ' MCT volume reduction permanent CVI-oedema 3 month treatment .</brief_summary>
