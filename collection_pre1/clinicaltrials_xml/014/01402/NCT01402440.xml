	<brief_summary>This study two phase , dose escalation phase dose expansion phase . For dose escalation , primary objective estimate maximum tolerate dose AEB071 patient diffuse large b-cell lymphoma . The endpoint objective occurrence Dose Limiting Toxicity . For dose expansion , primary objective characterize safety tolerability maximum tolerate dose recommended phase 2 dose AEB071 patient diffuse large b-cell lymphoma . The endpoint objective occurrence Adverse Events ( AEs ) , Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) , assessment clinical laboratory value , vital sign measurement .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) activate mutation CD79 ( A B subunit ) . DLBCL arise transformed indolent lymphoma allow . Prior treatment relapse follow anthracyclinebased chemotherapy autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant . Patients transplant eligible may consider study follow single regimen chemotherapy RCHOP REPOCH alone . There limit prior therapy allow . Patients may treat localized radiation many two site disease , long measurable evaluable disease remain untreated site . Patients may treat corticosteriods immediately prior enrollment course study treatment long steriod treatment taper toal daily dosage 10mg less prednisone ( 's equivalent ) prior AEB071 administration WHO performance status ≤2 Patients screen treat strong inducer inhibitor cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) discontinue . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : History presence ventricular tachyarrhythmia Presence unstable atrial fibrillation ( ventricular response &gt; 100 bpm ) ; Patients stable atrial fibrillation eligible , provide meet cardiac exclusion criterion . Angina pectoris acute myocardial infarction ≤ 3 month prior start study drug Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , symptomatic congestive heart failure ; uncontrolled arrhythmia hypertension ; history labile hypertension poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Patients another malignancy treat within last three year exception localize basal cell carcinoma cervical carcinoma . Patients impairment GI function GI disease could interfere absorption AEB071 . Patients known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) HIV test require part study Patients known history active hepatitis B C infection unless antiviral therapy The determination active hepatitis status per standard care site Hepatitis B C testing require part study Time since last prior therapy treatment underlie malignancy** : Cytotoxic chemotherapy : ≤ duration recent cycle previous regimen ( minimum 2 week ) Biologic therapy ( e.g. , antibody ) : ≤ 4 week ≤ 5 x t1/2 small molecule therapeutic , otherwise defined **Patients must recover stabilized toxicity relate previous treatment except alopecia Patients history significant coagulopathy medical condition require long term systemic anticoagulation would interfere biopsy . Patients undergone major surgery le 4 week prior enrollment fully recover prior surgery . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
