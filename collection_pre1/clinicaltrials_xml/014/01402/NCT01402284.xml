	<brief_summary>Background : - Carfilzomib experimental anti-cancer drug yet approve treat multiple myeloma . Lenalidomide drug may stop tumor growth help immune system kill cancer cell . Dexamethasone drug help stop inflammation . It sometimes use treat ( alone drug ) certain type cancer , especially multiple myeloma . This combination drug test people multiple myeloma . Researchers want see whether safe effective group . Objectives : - To test effectiveness combine carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone treat multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age multiple myeloma treat . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood urine test , bone marrow sample , molecular imaging study . - Participants eight 28-day cycle treatment . The combined study drug give tablet injection . Those study monitor frequent blood test , bone marrow sample , molecular imaging study . In addition current standard measure determine clinical response , molecular test conduct define evidence minimal residual disease . - After first four cycle therapy , eligible stem cell transplant stem cell collect stored use cancer return . - After stem cell collection , participant second four treatment cycle . - , If disease improve stable end eight cycle , study may another 12 cycle low-dose ( maintenance ) lenalidomide alone . - Participants regular follow-up visit end study chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable plasma cell neoplasm median survival 3-4 year . - Novel agent combination proteasome inhibitor demonstrate improve response rate increase survival MM patient . - A common debilitating side effect proteasome inhibitor bortezomib neuropathy . - Carfilzomib new proteasome inhibitor potent anti-MM effect decrease peripheral neuropathy Objectives : -Evaluate toxicity , include peripheral neuropathy , carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( CRd ) untreated MM patient Eligibility : - Newly diagnose patient histologically confirm multiple myeloma - Age great equal 18 year - Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 60 ml/min . CrCl calculate use Cockcroft- Gault method . If calculate CrCl base Cockcroft-Gault method &lt; 60 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also great equal 60 ml/min . - Without serious co-morbidity would interfere receipt CRd - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.0 K/uL , hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL , platelet count great equal 75 K/uL - Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin le 1.5 x ULN , AST ALT le 3.0 x ULN Design : - Single arm , single stage phase II trial combination therapy ( carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ) untreated multiple myeloma patient early stopping rule toxicity - Patients receive 8 cycle induction combination therapy CRd - Each cycle consist 28-days - After 4 cycle therapy , transplant eligible patient undergo stem cell collection - Patients achieve stable disease well 8 cycle CRd receive lenalidomide extend dosing ( phase I ) 12 cycle . After 12 cycle , patient option continue extend dosing ( phase II ) one additional year . - Patients routine blood work SPEP free light chain monthly - Pre- post-treatment bone marrow biopsy obtain confirmation diagnosis correlative study - Patients also undergo evaluation minimal residual disease regular interval time point , use multi-parametric flow cytometry FDG PET-CT - A single stage phase II design employ , early stopping rule . Unless 4 patient first 20 Grade 3 high neurologic toxicity first 2 complete cycle , total 45 evaluable patient enrol study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Newly diagnose patient histologically confirm MM base follow criterion : 1 . Clonal plasma cell bone marrow 2 . Measurable disease within past 4 week define one following : 1 . Serum monoclonal protein great equal 1.0 g/dL 2 . Urine monoclonal protein great than200 mg/24 hour 3 . Serum immunoglobulin free light chain great 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio 3 . Evidence underlying end organ damage attribute underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder meeting least one following : 1 . Hypercalcemia : serum calcium great equal 2.65 mmol/L 2 . Renal Insufficiency : serum creatinine great 2.0 mg/dL 3 . Anemia : hemoglobin value less than10 g/dL 2 g/dL less normal reference 4 . Bone disease : lytic lesion , severe osteopenia pathological fracture Creatinine Clearance great equal 60 ml/min . CrCl calculate CockcroftGault method . CrCl ( calculate ) = ( 140 Age ) x Mass ( kilogram ) x [ 0.85 Female ] 72 time Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) . If calculate CrCl base CockcroftGault method &lt; 60 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl msut also great equal 60 ml/min . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use carfilzomib combination lenalidomide patient le than18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.0 K/uL , hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) , platelet count great equal 75 K/uL Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin le 1.5 time ULN , AST ALT less 3.0 time ULN . All study participant must able tolerate one follow thromboprophylactic strategy : aspirin , low molecular weight heparin warfarin ( coumadin ) . All study participant must register mandatory RevAssist program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior prescribe lenalidomide Cycle 1 ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . Subjects must able give informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior concurrent systemic treatment MM . Treatment hypercalcemia spinal cord compression aggressively progress myeloma corticosteroid permit . Bisphosphonates permit . Treatment corticosteroids indication MM permit . Radiotherapy permit . Treatment smolder myeloma permit . Plasma cell leukemia Pregnant lactating female . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother carfilzomib combination lenalidomide , breastfeed discontinue mother treated carfilzomib lenalidomide . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes Active hepatitis B C infection Has significant cardiovascular disease NYHA Class III IV symptom , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , restrictive cardiomyopathy , myocardial infarction within 3 month prior enrollment , unstable angina , unstable arrhythmia determine history physical examination . Echocardiogram perform clinically warrant . Has refractory GI disease refractory nausea/vomiting , inflammatory bowel disease , bowel resection would prevent absorption Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would compromise compliance study requirement Significant neuropathy great equal Grade 3 baseline Contraindication concomitant medication , include antiviral , anticoagulation prophylaxis , tumor lysis prophylaxis , hydration give prior therapy Major surgery within 1 month prior enrollment Recruitment Strategies : Patients progress SMM MGUS Natural History Study ( NCI Protocol : 10C0096 ) potential candidate . Other participant source outside physician referral . Our ongoing natural history study outside physician referral network high representation minority .</criteria>
