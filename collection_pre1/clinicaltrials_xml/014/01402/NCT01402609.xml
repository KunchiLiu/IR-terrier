	<brief_summary>The transition acute care community care represent one vulnerable period health care delivery , particularly complexity inpatient population increase . Two recent North American study find incidence post-discharge adverse event 19-23 % , adverse drug event account 66-72 % . The vulnerability period attribute mainly failure care provider adequately reconcile discrepancy home medication discharge medication , well failure transfer important information hospitalization discharge community care provider . While discharge communication primary care physician traditionally occur via handwritten dictate summary , major deficit exist respect timeliness information transfer adequacy content discharge summary . Computer-enabled discharge communication potentially avert problem . This particularly true web-based solution require end user acquire additional software/training use . The purpose research definitively assess efficacy web-based seamless discharge communication tool Medical Ward 21st Century ( W21C - see www.w21c.org ) team Calgary develop iterative consultation multiple clinical stakeholder well patients/families . This tool great potential implement provincial level well across Canada internationally operate web interface confine applicability single type hospital information system . The purpose research definitively assess efficacy web-based discharge communication tool team develop partnership Alberta Health Services . In , specific objective answer follow research question : 1 . Is seamless discharge communication tool efficacious respect reduce hospital readmission mortality ( 3 month ) , well reduce adverse event adverse drug event ? 2 . Does seamless discharge communication tool transfer appropriate , complete , accurate discharge information timely manner compare traditional discharge communication ? 3 . Is seamless discharge communication tool efficacious respect improve physician patient satisfaction ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vulnerability transition period attribute three main factor . First , change patients'medication regimen hospitalization numerous , yet failure reconcile discrepancy admission discharge frequent . Second , patient/family require take care responsibility discharge must often relay important information primary care physician . This particularly challenging discharge information poorly communicate , present rapidly , instruction verbal , patient low literacy low health literacy.Finally , crucial information often transfer acute care physician community physician . Information hospitalization ( medication change , patient diagnosis , intervention , diagnostic finding , necessary follow-up ) commonly transfer primary care physician via discharge summary typically faxed mail . Unfortunately , deficit respect timeliness and/or complete failure transmit widespread . At first post-discharge appointment , discharge summary unavailable primary care physician 75 % time . This negatively impact continuity care provide many patient . When summary receive , inconsistent content inaccuracy common . Acute care physician , whether medical surgical , often neglect include diagnostic finding , treatment/hospital course , discharge medication , pending test result , whether patient family receive counsel . Computer-enabled discharge communication potential avert problem . Such communication platform provide immediate link acute care primary care physician , interface design ensure consistent information transfer . In addition , physician setting express preference electronic discharge document hand written/dictated summary respect clarity , comprehensiveness , positive impact continuity care .</detailed_description>
