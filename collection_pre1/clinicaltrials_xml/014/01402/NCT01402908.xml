	<brief_title>A Phase III Study PI-88 Adjuvant Treatment Subjects With Hepatitis Virus Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma HCC ) fifth common cancer worldwide . Surgery remove tumour remain principal form treatment liver cancer , however recurrence disease surgery common survival recurrence poor . At moment recommend standard treatment HCC immediately tumour remove surgically . PI-88 new experimental drug block growth new blood vessel tumours stop tumour grow ( starves food ) also stop tumour cell spread . Previous experience PI-88 show well tolerate show benefit delaying time take hepatocellular carcinoma reappear surgery . The purpose study determine PI-88 effective safe patient surgery remove primary liver cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criterion : 1 . Histologicallyproven primary hepatocellular carcinoma curative resection perform 4 6 week prior randomization . 2 . Age ≥ 18 year . 3 . Written , sign date informed consent participate study 4 . ECOG performance status 0 1 5 . Child Pugh score ≤ 8 6 . Platelet count ≥ 80 x 109 cells/liter 7 . PTINR ≤ 1.3 8. aPTT ≤ upper limit normal Key exclusion criterion : 1 . Pathological confirmation single tumor &lt; 2 cm diameter obtain recent hepatectomy . 2 . History immunemediated thrombocytopenia platelet abnormality hereditary acquire coagulopathies , laboratory evidence antiheparin antibody , previous history test positive antiheparin antibody . 3 . Any evidence tumor metastasis coexist malignant disease 4 . Any prior recurrence HCC liver resection prior recent procedure 5 . Clinically significant nonmalignant disease include , limited , surgery within 6 week randomization ( apart liver resection reoperation complication liver resection ) , active clinically significant infection within 6 week prior randomization , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior randomization , cerebrovascular event within 12 month prior randomization clinicallysignificant gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 month prior randomization . Subjects experience postoperative complication liver resection may enrol provide complication fully resolve time screen . 6 . Subjects uncontrolled infection serious infection within past 4 week . 7 . History prior HCC therapy include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , molecular target agent , vaccine , transarterial embolization ( TAE ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , liver transplantation surgical resection prior recent hepatectomy , time prior randomization . This include pre , peri postoperative treatment . Preoperative portal vein embolization permit . Subjects enrol , time randomization , plan subsequently undergo liver transplantation regardless tumor recurrence . 8 . Concomitant use aspirin ( &gt; 150 mg/day ) , vitamin K antagonist ( lowdose prophylactic use ) , heparin within two week prior randomization , antiplatelet drug ( e.g . abciximab , clopidogrel , dipyridamole , ticlopidine tirofiban ) . Low dose aspirin ( ≤ 150 mg/day ) lowdose prophylactic vitamin K antagonist ( e.g . warfarin ≤ 1 mg/day ) permit concomitant medication . 9 .
