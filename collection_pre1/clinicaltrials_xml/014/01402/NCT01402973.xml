	<brief_title>Pilot Study Dietary Intervention Based Upon Advanced Glycation End Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) , bioactive molecule form non-enzymatic glycation protein , emerge possible dietary risk factor many key adverse health outcome related obesity age . Major source systemic AGEs endogenous AGEs generate body exogenous AGEs find food . When food heat high temperature , characteristic `` browning '' generate Maillard reaction product , know AGEs . Although AGEs implicate atherosclerosis , insulin resistance , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , aging-related eye disease , Alzheimer 's disease , chronic kidney disease , possible adverse effect dietary AGEs well characterize human . The objective study determine whether feasible conduct randomize , parallel arm , control dietary intervention pilot study involve 24 subject ; compare effect high-AGE low-AGE diet ( ) serum urine carboxymethyl-lysine serum receptor AGEs ( RAGE ) , ( b ) endothelial function , ( c ) interleukin-6 , C-reactive protein , ( ) lipid , ( e ) adipokines , ( f ) glucose metabolism insulin resistance , ( g ) renal function , ( h ) cognition .</detailed_description>
