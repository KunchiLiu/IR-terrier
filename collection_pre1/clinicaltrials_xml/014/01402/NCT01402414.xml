	<brief_title>Narrow-band ( NB ) -UVB vs. Bath-PUVA NB-UVB Plus Salt Water Baths Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) common skin disorder characterize pruritic inflammatory skin lesion , patient usually individual family history atopic diseases background ( e.g. , allergic asthma rhinitis ) . Defective skin barrier , immunological dysfunction ( type I IV allergy ) , genetic disorder , psychological factor contribute pathogenesis AD . However , among factor , CD4+ Th cell report play particularly crucial role pathogenesis AD . Phototherapy among first-line approach management AD . In context , variety study show beneficial effect natural artificial UV radiation AD . Different broadband ( BB ) UV spectrum ( BB-UVA , BB-UVB , BB-UVA/BB-UVB ) combine treatment modality balneophototherapy PUVA previously proven effective AD . A small control study previously demonstrate combination UVB/UVA saltwater bath superior phototherapy alone . Previous data uncontrolled study also speak effectiveness systemic psoralen plus UVA ( PUVA ) therapy . A control crossover study show systemic PUVA therapy clearly superior UVA1 phototherapy term clinical score ( SCORAD ) reduction response time . Systemic PUVA relation bath PUVA significantly great adverse effect ( eg , nausea , liver enzyme elevation , photocarcinogenesis ) . A direct comparison NB-UVB bath PUVA study half-side comparison small number patient . Both therapy prove equally effective . In recent study , show clear advantage NB-UVB plus salt water bath comparison NB-UVB alone . Tolerability comparable ; treatment show safe . A randomized observer-blinded control crossover trial conduct patient AD receive 4-week course NB-UVB bath-PUVA NB-UVB plus salt water bath . Clinical efficacy assess use Six Area , Six Sign , Atopic Dermatitis ( SASSAD ) score visual analogue scale pruritus . Assessment health-related quality life perform use Skindex-29 . Moreover , immunohistochemical , RT-PCR serological study plan .</detailed_description>
