	<brief_title>Trivalent Influenza Vaccine Preventing Flu Patients With Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective pilot study assess efficacy influenza vaccination patient central nervous system tumor define four-fold increase hemagglutinin inhibition ( HI ) titers pre-vaccination baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . A secondary objective pilot study assess efficacy influenza vaccination patient central nervous system tumor define serum post-vaccination HI titer least 1:40 . II . The secondary objective pilot study include assessment relationship variety clinical factor seroconversion follow influenza vaccination . III . Subgroup analyse include investigation seroconversion treatment ( actively receive chemotherapy , radiation therapy ) , disease status ( active treatment v long term followup ) , use dose glucocorticoid . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . An additional area interest explore pilot study assessment relationship serologic marker immune function response vaccination . OUTLINE : Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 day , 21 day , 3 and/or 6 month .</detailed_description>
