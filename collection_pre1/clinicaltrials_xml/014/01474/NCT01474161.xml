	<brief_summary>The Sponsor , Genfit , develop new formulation GFT505 ( 60 mg ) . The objective compare relative bioavailability new GFT505 formulation ( capsule dose 60 mg GFT505 ) old GFT505 formulation ( capsule dose 20 mg GFT505 ) healthy male subject assess impact gender relative bioavailability administration male female subject . Using new formulation , single multiple ascend dose study perform overweight obese male subject otherwise healthy whose demographic physiological characteristic think close target population ( Type 2 diabetes ) . Thereafter , group male female patient Type 2 diabetes receive multiple dose administration GFT505 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Bioavailability - Gender Effect - Single Multiple Ascending Dose Safety Pharmacokinetic Study GFT505</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide 4 successive part : - Study Part I comparative bioavailability new GFT505 formulation ( capsule dose 60 mg GFT505 capsule ) old GFT505 formulation ( capsule dose 20 mg GFT505 capsule ) couple evaluation gender effect assess new formulation . In purpose group 12 male subject receive successively formulation unique occasion randomize manner group 12 female subject receive new formulation one occasion . This part study do healthy volunteer . - Study Part II single ascend dose run maximum 3 dose level . Subjects include part study receive one dose level limit exposure GFT505 . Three cohorts 8 subject plan include . This part run overweight obese subject . - Study Part III start completion first Cohort Study Part II . Study Part III multiple ascend dose run maximum 3 dose level . Subjects include part study receive one dose level limit exposure GFT505 . Three cohorts 12 subject plan include . This part run overweight obese subject . - Study Part IV follow design treatment schedule Study Part III perform target population , patient Type 2 diabetes one dose test study part IV .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part I : Male female healthy volunteer 18 45 year age ( inclusive ) . Subjects body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 18 ≤ 28 kg/m2 screening . For female subject childbearing potential , use double contraception method . Normal arterial blood pressure ( BP ) pulse rate , abnormal , consider clinically significant principal Investigator . Part II III : Male healthy volunteer 18 55 year age ( inclusive ) . Subjects BMI &gt; 28 &lt; 35 kg/m2 screening . Normal arterial BP pulse rate , abnormal , consider clinically significant principal Investigator . Part IV : Male female Type 2 diabetic patient 18 60 year age . Females participate study must either nonchild bear potential use efficient double contraception . Currently treat antidiabetic treatment ( maximum two antidiabetic drug include metformin case ) exception insulin GLP analog agonists therapy . Stable diabetes glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &lt; =10 % less . Normal renal function define creatine clearance &gt; 90 mL/min calculate CockcroftGault formula . Subjects BMI 18 32 kg/m2 screening . Part I : Who previously receive GFT505 . With clinically significant abnormality follow review prestudy laboratory test ( Aspartate Alanine aminotransferase must within normal range ) , vital sign , full physical examination Electrocardiogram . Who positive laboratory test Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) , antiHIV 1/2 ( Human immunodeficiency virus ) antiHCV ( Hepatitis C virus ) antibody . Who know suspected alcohol drug abuser ( 14 unit alcohol per week , one unit = 8 g 10 mL pure alcohol ) . Who drink 8 cup daily beverage contain caffeine . Who positive laboratory test urine drug screening ( opiate , cocaine , amphetamine , cannabis , benzodiazepine ) . Who undergo surgery donate blood within 12 week prior start study . Who take prescribed counter drug ( include antacid drug ) , exception paracetamol ( 3 g per day ) within 2 week prior first dose administration . Part II III : specific additional exclusion criterion Who take fibrates within 6 week prior first dose administration . Part IV : specific additional exclusion criterion With unstable proliferative retinopathy , macular oedema ( fundus examination perform previous year consider relevant Investigator 's judgement ) . Who take fibrates within 6 week prior first dose administration .</criteria>
