	<brief_summary>The primary objective study answer whether evidence measurable effect social responsiveness ( primary outcome ) behavioral symptom treatment autistic male adolescent adult orally administer sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract ( efficacy ) . The secondary objective study answer whether treatment male adolescent adult autism use orally administer sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract within specify dose range safe ( toxicity ) ; treatment sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract well tolerate ( side effect adverse event ) ; key cellular biomarkers support hypothesize mechanism ( proof principle ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral improvement occur transiently febrile illness autism , include decrease repetitive behavior improve speech . These change record 38 % autistic child clinical survey 83 % observational study , respectively . The cellular basis `` fever effect '' unknown likely involve heat shock protein ( HSP ) cellular stress response ( CSR ) lead change synaptic function network connectivity . Sulforaphane ( 1-isothiocyanato-4R- ( methylsulfinyl ) butane ) isothiocyanate deliver lyophilized extract 3-day-old broccoli sprout . Broccoli sprout widely consume food item world large number individual , without report adverse effect . Our preliminary work vitro show sulforaphane stimulates HSP mitochondrial biogenesis several genetic disorder . This study sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract autism randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , phase II single site trial , design ensure safety obtain efficacy data , focus change social responsiveness , core feature autism . Its hybrid design , incorporate double masking , placebo control , randomization , enhance robustness early outcome data . The study duration 2 year . Recruitment subject 50 % 8 month complete 14 month . All subject study follow 22 week . Treatment ( 18 week ) start patient enter study receive baseline test . All treatment complete 20 month data analysis presentation result 24 month . Forty-five male adolescent ( 13-18 year ) adult ( 19-30 year ) autism randomly assign receive either sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract ( n = 30 ) placebo ( n = 15 ) . The 2:1 randomization schedule produce study statistician use permuted random block stratification history positive behavioral effect fever . Treatment assignment perform research pharmacy MGH . Females exclude homogeneity sample male higher incidence autism female ( 4:1 ) . We seek enroll 50 % subject history positive behavioral effect fever , record caregiver ' recall incident grade CGI-Improvement ( CGI-I ) 7-point scale . There total 7 study visit subject : screening visit , enrollment visit , blood draw visit 24 hour first dose study medication ( mitochondrial/heat shock protein analysis ) , 4 week ( follow-up ) visit , 10 week ( follow-up ) visit , 18 week visit ( last treatment visit ) , final closeout visit one month study drug stop ( 22 week ) . Even though treatment stop 18 week , follow subject additional 4 week study medication stop ( 22 week visit ) ensure safety study drug stop . Additional visit may conduct case side effect report stage study .</detailed_description>
