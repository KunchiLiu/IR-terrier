	<brief_summary>Persistent neurocognitive deficit major cause severe disability impair long-term psychosocial outcome schizophrenia ( SZ ) . In particular , within auditory system , early deficit behavioral neurophysiological ability match tone vary pitch correlate impairment auditory emotion recognition ( affective prosody ) general functioning , suggest intervention aim remediate sensory-level dysfunction may lead significant improvement high order cognitive/emotion process . Efforts ameliorate cognitive deficit schizophrenia utilize either pharmacological agent behavioral treatment cognitive remediation , generally focus high order process , early sensory processing may key function . Numerous pharmacological agent propose , accumulate evidence suggest dysfunction N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptor may one root cause schizophrenia , include sensory cognitive impairment , suggest NMDA base treatment may efficacious reverse deficit . D-Cycloserine , synthetic partial NMDA agonist use anxiety disorder augment learn cognitive remediation . Because tendency act NMDA antagonist high dose D-cycloserine effective schizophrenia . In contrast , D-serine ( DSR ) , full agonist , therefore ideal enhance NMDA function cognitive remediation . While previous use DSR limit safety concern rodent , investigator show safely used dos 60 mg/kg , moreover , demonstrate converge improvement symptomatic , cognitive sensory-based measure schizophrenia . Evidence also suggest NMDA receptor dysfunction schizophrenia may relative , rather absolute , suggest enhanced practice cognitive remediation paradigm might able overcome reduce plasticity treat cognitive dysfunction . This project first combine NMDA base sensory-based cognitive remediation ( SBR ) approach , utilize DSR , also tone match SBR paradigm show enhance learn healthy control , well paradigm design augment visual motion detection . This study pilot intervention double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized crossover design use neurophysiology together cognitive test explore effect brain activity cognitive function 16 patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . The investigator hypothesize DSR+SBR lead improvement . Subjects initial visit establish baseline performance cognitive task return 3 visit receive blind study medication [ 60 mg/kg DSR ( 2 day ) placebo ( 1 day ) ] randomize order . The procedure treatment day include SBR paradigm pre/post neurophysiological measurement . Primary outcomes improvement neurophysiologic behavioral sensory processing . The main goal establish preliminary efficacy use follow-up multi-dose study utilize multiple session SBR R01 application .</brief_summary>
