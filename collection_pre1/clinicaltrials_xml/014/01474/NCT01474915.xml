	<brief_summary>This study do determine efficacy two preventative drug combination postoperative nausea vomit patient undergoing neurosurgery . The aim study compare efficacy use aprepitant instead ondansetron combination dexamethasone promethazine post-operative nausea vomit prophylaxis . By complete comparison study investigator determine efficacious drug combination allow u enhance overall comfort satisfaction neurosurgical patient immediate postoperative period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aprepitant Versus Ondansetron Preoperative Triple-therapy Treatment Nausea Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred-seventy-six ( 200 ) consecutive patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion give write informed consent participate study randomly assign one two experimental group use 1:1 ratio . Patients Group I receive 25mg promethazine give intravenously ( IV ) , 10mg dexamethasone give IV , 4mg ondansetron give intravenously , placebo pill give orally . Patients Group II receive 25mg promethazine give IV , 10mg dexamethasone give IV , 40mg aprepitant give orally , intravenous placebo . Thus patient receive 25mg promethazine 10mg dexamethasone . Group I additionally receive 4mg ondansetron plus placebo PO Group II additionally receive 40mg aprepitant plus IV placebo . Because double-blind study ondansetron give intravenously whereas aprepitant give orally , necessary give patient oral IV placebo , depend group assignment uniformity . Thus patient receive three drug PONV prophylactic triple cocktail , plus IV oral placebo prior induction anesthesia . See table . The following demographic preoperative data patient two group record : Demographic Preoperative Data Gender Systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , median blood pressure Age Smoking history PONV History Motion sickness history Surgery Anesthesia modality CPP Race ECG record Hepatic function Renal function Past reaction study drug The duration surgery ( anesthesia time ) record patient . Patients continuously monitor post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) medical floor total 120 hour post operatively . Episodes nausea , vomit administration rescue therapy either nausea vomit recorded time stamp . In addition , severity nausea vomit record . Nausea evaluate patient utilizing standard verbal response scale ( VRS ) range 0-10 , 0 nausea 10 severe nausea . Vomiting evaluated investigator nursing staff numerically either 0 , vomit , 1 , mild vomiting , 2 , moderate vomiting , 3 , severe vomit . Rescue therapy PONV episodes consist 4mg ondansetron . After first 24hrs start triple therapy antiemetic , ECG record well blood drawn analysis . Variables Primary Efficacy Variable The percentage patient vomit 0-72 hour post operatively across two treatment group . Secondary Efficacy Variables : Proportion patient complete response delay ( 24-120 hour ; day 2-5 ) overall ( 0-120 hour ; day 1-5 ) neurological surgery general anesthesia . Proportion patient complete control , define emetic episode , need rescue medication mild nausea overall ( 0-120 hour ; day 1-5 ) neurological surgery general anesthesia . Assess severity nausea vomit acute ( 0-24 hour ) , delay ( 24-120 hour ) overall ( 0-120 hour ) interval neurological surgery general anesthesia . Assess time treatment failure ( defined time first emetic episode and/or first use rescue medication ) . Assess time first emetic episode . Assess time significant nausea ( define nausea rat â‰¥ 4 0 10 verbal response scale nausea require rescue therapy ) . Adverse Reactions Treatment The incidence adverse reaction treatment two experimental group record . In ondansetron-treated patient ( Group I ) , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , hepatic , integumentary neurologic postoperative adverse event record analyze cause . For instance , treatment-related diarrhea , headache , fever , akathisia acute dystonic reaction record analyze . Similarly , aprepitant-patients ( Group II ) adverse event related digestive , hemic , lymphatic , nervous , cardiovascular respiratory system record analyzed cause .</detailed_description>
