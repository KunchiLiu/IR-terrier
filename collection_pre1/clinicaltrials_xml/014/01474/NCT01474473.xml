	<brief_summary>CACIPLIQ20 nanopolymer engineer mimic glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate . Glycosaminoglycans imply 1 ) stabilization micro-environment cell , know extracellular matrix , bind structural protein , 2 ) cell communication protect growth factor . At site lesion , glycosaminoglycans degrade , thereby extracellular matrix disorganize tissue destroy . By replace damage glycosaminoglycans , CACIPLIQ20 provide protective function restores matrix architecture cell communication , process know Matrix Therapy . As , three non-controlled pilot study carry small population . They show substantial enhancement chronic wound state treatment CACIPLIQ20 . Therefore , purpose new control study determine whether CACIPLIQ20 shorten diabetic neuropathic plantar ulcer heal off-loading mandatory . The study 's main hypothesis CACIPLIQ20 application non-healing diabetic plantar ulcer off-loading mandatory context would reinitiate natural process tissue regeneration lead total wound closure faster follow standard wound care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Of CACIPLIQ20 On Diabetic Ulcers In Patients Wearing An Nonremovable , Windowed , Fiberglass Cast Boot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study specifically target diabetic patient present neuropathic plantar ulcer . Diabetic patient 25 % risk develop foot ulcer life , one diabetes-induced amputation perform every 30 second world . Textbook-case perforating foot ulcer ( Malum Perforans Pedis ) cause mechanical impairment : thoroughly observe discharge may lead good wound care , ultimately , heal . Thus , study proposes utilization nonremovable windowed Fiberglass Cast Boot , technique lead heal 6 8 week 95 % neuropathic foot ulcer treat way . As 80 % amputation cause non-healing ulcer , appear obvious enhance foot wound heal could reduce amputation rate way fairly improve diabetic patient ' quality life .</detailed_description>
