	<brief_title>HCV-TARGET- Hepatitis C Therapeutic Registry Research Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCV-TARGET longitudinal , observational study create carefully maintain research registry HCV patient treat antiviral therapy design rapidly inform strategy well management population underrepresented clinical trial , identify remediate educational gap relative treatment guideline adverse event management order optimize rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) , serve core resource important collaborative translational study utilize biospecimens clinical data diverse patient population . HCV-TARGET cooperative academic consortium principal investigator Clinical Translational Award ( CTSA ) -funded academic institution community-based site affiliate academic site geographic proximity . The Clinical Coordinating Center ( CCC ) reside University Florida Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) reside University North Carolina Chapel Hill . The HCV-TARGET registry characterize population chronic hepatitis C ( HCV ) patient treat antiviral therapy academic community site . Patient characteristic age , race , ethnicity , comorbidity , disease treatment status examine . HCV-TARGET also : 1 . Provide baseline treatment response data use pre-identify candidate enrollment future clinical trial . HCV-TARGET also develop well-characterized cohort protease inhibitor treatment failure consider future trial . 2 . Establish maintain data , specimen bank resource ancillary study pathogenesis , diagnosis , natural history treatment HCV infection . This study investigate various aspect treatment response regimens contain direct-acting antiviral agent treatment chronic hepatitis C , include follow : - Patients underrepresented clinical trial approve antiviral therapy ( include African-Americans , patient cirrhosis , patient consider null responder treatment . ) - Treatment persistence - Virological breakthrough - Impact viral load measurement treatment efficacy - Adverse Event Management Surveillance . The secondary aim study investigate following : - Sustained virological response ( SVR ) rate safety special population . - Surveillance drug-drug interaction . - Treatment management adherence . - Pretreatment Education HCV patient population . - Use specialty pharmacy hepatitis C therapy .</detailed_description>
