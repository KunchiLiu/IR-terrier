	<brief_summary>The CATCH-enoxaparin trial natural continuation CATCH study . It capitalize fact patient enrol CATCH study specifically screen asymptomatic thromboembolism ( TEs ) order answer important clinical question . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial address whether , among pediatric patient congenital heart defect ( CHD ) recover cardiovascular surgery diagnose asymptomatic venous TE , use enoxaparin result net therapeutic benefit ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enoxaparin Children With Asymptomatic Venous Thrombosis After Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To address whether , among pediatric patient congenital heart defect ( CHD ) recover cardiovascular surgery diagnose asymptomatic venous TE , use enoxaparin result net therapeutic benefit . We hypothesize enoxaparin dose per age-appropriate algorithm associate increased rate clot resolution decrease rate clot progression/long-term complication child CHD asymptomatic venous TE . Benefits clot resolution outweigh risk associate use enoxaparin result net therapeutic benefit favour enoxaparin use context . Secondary aim study : 1 . To compare rate conversion asymptomatic symptomatic TE and/or thromboembolic event treat untreated patient . Hypothesis : use enoxaparin significantly reduce rate conversion asymptomatic symptomatic TE . 2 . To compare rate objective clot progression ( regression ) serial image ultrasound echocardiography treat untreated patient . Hypothesis : use enoxaparin significantly increase rate clot regression . 3 . To identify factor associate : TE conversion asymptomatic symptomatic , clot resolution post-thrombotic syndrome treat untreated patient separately . Hypothesis : old child mature coagulation system TEs superficial vessel ( rather deep/systemic vessel ) low frequency TE complication . 4 . To establish rate bleed complication ( minor major ) patient enoxaparin . Hypothesis : expect major bleed complication present 2-3 % treated patient minor bleed complication frequent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pediatric patient cardiac defect ( acquire congenital ) 2 . Recent cardiac surgery ( current hospital admission ) 3 ) Presence venous clot confirm appropriate diagnostic imaging method associate either ≥ 25 % blood vessel occlusion ( clot diameter/vessel diameter ) OR ≥ 3mm absolute diameter 3 . Enrollment Heart Centre Biobank Registry 4 . Enrollment CATCH main study 1 . Clots associate follow symptom : swelling , edema , discoloration high temperature affect territory . 2 . Clots vascular segment/location ( arterial clot , intracardiac clot ) degree vessel occlusion obligatory warrant treatment 3 . Prosthetic heart valve 4 . Active previous cancer history 5 . Known congenital coagulopathy thrombophilic disorder 6 . Liver failure ( AST , ALT % bilirubin 2x normal ) 7 . Need anticoagulation treatment prophylaxis reason ( e.g . BT shunt , recent thrombosis require anticoagulation ) 8 . Previous document residual clot within vascular territory affect current asymptomatic clot 9 . Increased bleeding risk reflect severe thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 30,000/ml ) and/or coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 4.0 aPTT &gt; 120 ) 10 . Active bleeding major bleed &lt; 10 day ago ( surgery relate ) 11 . Previous neurosurgery &lt; 14 day ago 12 . Uncontrolled severe hypertension ( &gt; 95th percentile age ) 13 . Previous proven diagnosis heparininducedthrombocytopenia ( HIT ) &lt; 100 day ago 14 . Absolute contraindication heparin/LMWH ( e.g . severe heparin allergy ) 15 . Pregnancy breastfeed 16 . No planned followup The Hospital Sick Children While patient identify part CATCH study predischarge fullbody vascular ultrasound , patient enrol CATCH also identify asymptomatic clot identify clinically indicated radiological study . For patient already enrol CATCH study Heart Centre Biobank Registry , approach consent obtain study prior enrolment CATCHenoxaparin study .</criteria>
