	<brief_summary>Exercise adjunct routine treatment may useful help young people recover distress mental health problem , seldom get sufficient support help exercise . The reason may service agree benefit exercise , lack reliable evidence show benefit exercise young people use mental health service . Compliance prescribe exercise generally low , investigator think relatively young people drop specially design programme . The investigator find young 'healthy ' people may respond good exercise match ability . The investigator sure would work young people mental health difficulty , investigator want test . The investigator also find enable exercise plan , social support motivational coaching , help people depression take part , drop . The aim study see exercise match ability , support take part , help young people recover distress mental health difficulty . The investigator also want ask young people feel exercise part recovery . The investigator want see motivational coaching help ongoing participation exercise , investigator want follow young people six month see still exercise . The investigator believe study important help young people feel well , improve quality life . This important national public health goal enable young people grow healthy adult , maintain health throughout adulthood . If study successful , investigator believe potential change way mental health service deliver care young people . If investigator help young people feel well , improve general health well exercise , investigator may reduce reliance mental health service . Research hypotheses A tailored exercise intervention lead significantly improve mental health outcome reduce exercise attrition rate young people depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims 1 . Compare mental health outcome depressed young people receive tailored exercise intervention mental health outcome depressed young people wait list control group . 2 . Explore young people 's experience exercise treatment depression . 3 . Investigate attrition rate tailor exercise intervention group . 4 . Investigate longevity change exercise habit six month follow . 5 . Conduct economic evaluation tailor exercise intervention . Research Questions 1 . Does exercise intervention programme tailor young people 's exercise level significantly improve mental health outcome exercise attrition rate young people depression ? 2 . Are change exercise habit outcome bring participation tailor exercise programme still evident six month post intervention ? 3 . How cost-effective tailored exercise intervention young people depression ? 4 . How acceptable tailored exercise intervention young people depression ? Design : Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial . An experimental arm tailor exercise intervention wait list control group . Sample : 14-17yr old attend Tier 2 Tier 3 Child Adolescent Mental Health outpatient service Nottingham City Nottinghamshire County , present depression . For 80 % power detect difference mean change two group 8 point Children 's Depression Inventory ( primary outcome measure ) , assume equal standard deviation 16 point , significance level p &lt; 0.05 need 126 participant . Assuming equal attrition 20 % recruit 158 participant . Random allocation experimental control arm . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : Presenting symptom define assigned clinician CAMHS team , oppose specific diagnosis . Eligible participant : presenting depression . Exclusions : Unable participate injury physical health problem preclude participation , regular exerciser indicate response SCQ . Intervention : Intervention consist 12x 60 minute aerobic exercise session , group 10 , tailor participant ' exercise level preference assess use Stages Change Exercise Questionnaire ( SCQ ) . Psychosocial motivational support throughout session facilitate ongoing participation endure change consist behaviour modification : goal setting , self-monitoring , social support , enhance self-efficacy shaping . A variety lifestyle activity use associate improved compliance rate . Control group : Waiting list receive usual care . The facilitator use experimental intervention . Outcome primary measure : Depression , capture use Child Depression Inventory ( CDI ) - 5 scale measure negative mood , interpersonal difficulty , negative self-esteem , ineffectiveness anhedonia , design 7-17 year old , sensitive change propose timescale , quick administer yield aggregate score indicate depressive illness clinically significant depression . We measure number exercise session complete , physical fitness use maximum energy expend , health social care cost use Client Receipt Service Inventory ( CRSI ) , Quality life use EQ-5D total number incident self-harm violence , treatment receive compliance , 12 week intervention period . Outcome measure collect baseline , post-intervention six month follow-up . Data Analysis : Two group , describe term baseline characteristic . Primary outcome CDI post intervention . A regression model use compare two group term CDI score post intervention conditional baseline score . No confounders adjust unless 's imbalance baseline two group pre-specified covariates consider influence outcome . For secondary outcome , similar model build conditional relevant baseline score addition baseline CDI score . Analyses intention-to-treat conducted dataset code two intervention group unlabeled . All estimate effect size number need treat report 95 % confidence interval . The statistical analysis conduct independently research team assistance Clinical Trials Support Unit , University Nottingham Medical School . Economic evaluation : We collect resource use data use CRSI . Resource use value use publish appropriate patient report , unit cost . The primary measure cost effectiveness analysis SPPA . Assessing health relate quality life use EQ-5D enable cost utility analysis undertaken trial period . Using information cost benefit incremental economic analysis compare intervention usual treatment undertaken estimate mean cost-effectiveness . If one group clearly dominant ( less costly effective ) recommendation make . If benefit significantly different cost minimisation approach adopt recommend cheap option . If non-dominance occurs ( cost great intervention effective intervention cheap less effective ) , incremental cost-effectiveness ratio produce value judgement value money need make . To test robustness result face uncertainty , improve generalisability result , sensitivity analysis conduct . In addition , uncertainty surround cost-effectiveness tailored exercise intervention present graphically use Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves . Should data skew non-parametric bootstrap analysis use percentile method confidence interval do incremental net benefit estimate . The qualitative study : The MRC Complex intervention Framework , show service delivery often involve therapeutic element difficult define essential , also use qualitative methodology alongside traditional trial design elicit barrier driver service delivery intervention . Therefore , conduct 3 focus group 45 minute , 6-7 participant select intervention group diverse opinion , facilitate two service user . We explore acceptability , pros con tailor approach , work less successful . This help explain why/how intervention effective , case , fail . We record focus group transcribe . Transcripts cod analyse pattern , theme sub-categories , pay particular attention outlier rival explanation give participant . We supplement data one minute 'box pop ' video recording , two participant per week , explore young people ' experience intervention . To ensure validity , result feed back focus group leader interested participant , whose interpretation integrate conclusion . Implementation Analysis : The analysis implementation diffusion innovation increasingly undertaken order understand knowledge transfer research clinical practice health service . We propose use Steering Group implementation analysis project 's finding . Such approach line MRC guidance develop evaluate complex intervention . In steer group propose elicit member issue relate uptake finding propose study barrier may encounter . We ask member group complete proforma elicit Social Network Analysis interaction service provider well understand concern provider immediately associate project .</detailed_description>
