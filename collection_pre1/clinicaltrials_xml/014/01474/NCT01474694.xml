	<brief_summary>Preoperative image-guided data correlate actual intraoperative reality . Computer-assisted preoperative planning combine intraoperative mapping even small lesion allow improved accuracy complete oncological resection / ablation . In short- long-term possibly result well patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The aim study analyze available accuracy computer-assisted approach liver surgery microwave ablation . The term 'computer-assisted ' refers 1 ) use 3D model patient anatomy extended orientation plan intervention 2 ) use image guidance system ( similar GPS car ) allow precise target desired anatomical structure ( e.g . intrahepatic tumor , bile duct / vasculature ) set successfully treat liver malignancy . Furthermore , would like demonstrate , image guide open liver surgery technically feasible , whenever correlation preoperative image-guided data intraoperative setting achieve know accuracy . Eventually , technology , like surgical domain , lead successively implemented technical guiding functionality could potentially improve patient outcome . Objective To date , first system ( CE mark medical device ) available specifically develop image-guided open liver surgery . The system track position surgical instrument near target organ visualize instrument position correlation patient medical image data ( i.e . 3D-CT ) computer screen . Surgeons benefit view virtual scene ( computer screen ) CT image , together model vascular structure , tumor organ boundary , intuitively visible . The surgeon see move instrument , like movement car see GPS system Methods In patient require extensive surgery ( eg . extend right hemihepatectomy ) , accurate calculation remain liver volume essential avoid postoperative liver failure potentially serious postoperative complication even death , result inadequate remain liver volume ( ie `` small-for-size syndrome '' ) . In high-risk liver resection , use computer program , MeVis ( MeVis Medical Solutions Inc. ) , provide surgeon accurate preoperative information , allow / judge feasibility plan surgical resection base preoperative liver volume analysis evaluation plan resection line relation essential structure ( ie . major vessel / bile duct ) .</detailed_description>
