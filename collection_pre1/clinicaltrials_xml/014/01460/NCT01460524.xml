	<brief_summary>In randomize controlled trial , use nebulized hypertonic saline acute bronchiolitis report improve respiratory distress score , reduce length hospital stay show trend towards low hospitalization rate . The investigator aim verify observational study rate hospital admission length hospital stay infant present emergency department ( ED ) bronchiolitis decrease inclusion 5.85 % nebulized hypertonic saline treatment strategy ED hospitalization ward . The investigator assess evolution hospital admission rate length hospital stay two hospital use 5.85 % nebulized hypertonic saline treatment bronchiolitis two hospital use nebulizations . If nebulized hypertonic saline effective setting , hospitalization rate length stay low year hypertonic saline use compare two previous year therapy use . These parameter would modify center use hypertonic saline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This before-after observational study design compare result term hospitalization rate length hospital stay period nebulized hypertonic saline include treatment bronchiolitis infant versus two previous year therapy use two hospital . There randomization . Physicians instructed use hypertonic saline moderate severe bronchiolitis infant totally whether use nebulization particular patient . Two hospital nebulized hypertonic saline never use use next bronchiolitis epidemic control center . The study comprise two period , one prospective start November 2011 end March 2012 one retrospective include two previous bronchiolitis epidemic , November 2009-March 2012 November 2010-March 2011 . During prospective period standardize assessment respiratory status infant carry hypertonic saline nebulization .</detailed_description>
