	<detailed_description>Melanoma arise choroid ciliary body common primary intraocular cancer . The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study ( COMS ) randomize clinical trial I-125 brachytherapy versus enucleation medium-sized choroidal melanoma ( 2.5-10.0 mm thickness ≤ 16 mm diameter ) show , patient meet eligibility criterion , statistically significant difference all-cause mortality I-125 brachytherapy enucleation 5 , 10 , 12 year follow treatment . The COMS trial support use globe-conserving I-125 brachytherapy . Following brachytherapy , however , visual acuity treat eye generally decline rate approximately 2 line visual acuity per year nearly 45 % patient lose ambulatory vision ( ≤20/200 ) treat eye 3 year . Adverse effect plaque brachytherapy include cataract , radiation-associated proliferative retinopathy , maculopathy papillopathy . Radiation maculopathy , may result decreased central vision , cystoid macular edema ( CME ) , macular ischemia , chorioretinal atrophy , report series 18 % 43 % treated eye within 5 year brachytherapy . Typical onset occur 18-24 month follow treatment . Primary risk factor radiation papillopathy maculopathy total radiation dose affect structure , proximity tumor affect structure systemic condition diabetes mellitus . No treatment radiation maculopathy papillopathy proven effective randomized clinical trial . Radiation injury vital structure may avoid shield use material lead high effective atomic number density tissue . However , solid metal amenable use within eye ( Figure 1 ) . There previous effort try use vitreous substitute order protect intraocular structure deleterious effect radiation . In animal study , Finger et al , demonstrate iodinated contrast agent ( iophendylate , iohexol , iopamidol ) could block radiation intraocularly . But substances highly toxic could retain eye due high water solubility . The technique vitrectomy oil tamponade plaque brachytherapy perform previously human Dr. Tara McCannel UCLA . During paper presentation 2010 meeting American Society Retina Specialist Vancouver , BC , first series 10 patient present , complication technique report . It commonly apply technique center treatment choroidal melanoma ( Oncology Times 2010 ; 32 ( 14 ) :36 , UCLA , Clinical Update 2011 ; 20 ( 1 ) :1 , 4 ) In prospective pilot study investigator propose patient undergo standard plaque placement treatment ocular melanoma addition par plana vitrectomy silicone oil infusion . When patient return schedule plaque removal one week later , also undergo removal silicone oil eye . Placement silicone oil alter radiation dose deliver tumor , physical space tumor radioactive plaque silicone oil present . The reduction radiation healthy ocular structure use oil technique may sufficient avoid clinical complication cause radiation-induced injury .</detailed_description>

Tumor inclusion criterion : Unilateral choroidal melanoma , medium size define COMS classification : 1 . At least 2.5 mm height , 10 mm height ( 8.0 mm whenever tumor near optic disc ) , 2 . No 16.0 mm In diameter , regardless shape ultrasound . History previous treatment choroidal melanoma . Pregnancy . Patients impairment prevent attend followup appointment . The presence concomitant significant lifetreating medical condition significantly reduce life expectancy less three year . The presence visiontreating ophthalmic condition , directly relate choroidal melanoma likely go require intraocular surgery next three year . Clinical radiological evidence presence metastatic disease . The presence significant medium opacity ( e.g . cataract ) preclude investigator 's ability grade tumor , performs retina surgery , performs followup assessment . Patients accept informed consent Tumor exclusion criterion : Inability successfully grade , stage delineate tumor ultrasound . Tumor location prevent correct placement plaque significant risk optic nerve damage plaque placement . Tumors involve anterior chamber angle , iris detectable extrascleral extension . Tumor margin location &lt; 1000 µm fovea .</criteria>
