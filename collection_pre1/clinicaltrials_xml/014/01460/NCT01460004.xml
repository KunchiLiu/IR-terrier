	<detailed_description>Introduction : Patellar tendinopathy ( Jumper 's knee ) condition usually characterize localized pain tenderness patellar tendon origin inferior pole patella . Patellar tendinopathy use injury implies mismatch stress give tissue ability tissue withstand stress . Rapid repetitive action acceleration , deceleration , jump land place great stress extensor mechanism patellar tendon . Current prevalence report patellar tendinopathy 20 % among elite athlete range sport , high proportion professional basketball ( 32 % ) volleyball ( 45 % ) player . The common treatment patellar tendinopathy preventative conservative ( physical therapy ) .

In spite frequent use strap young athlete subjective report decrease anterior knee pain experience athlete use , mechanism reduce anterior knee pain explain . In addition , data strap effect regard extent pain functional performance jump population . The purpose study : To examine effect infra patellar strap treatment extent pain jump performance task young male athlete diagnose patellar tendinopathy . Methods : 20 elite male athlete , basketball volleyball player , age 14-18 , student academy sport Excellency take part study . Athletes approach physical therapy department Ribstein Center Sport Medicine Sciences Research Wingate Institute , anterior knee pain , examine professional physical therapist . The one diagnose chronic patellar tendinopathy include study . Each athlete attend one meeting perform four test : Squat jump test , Drop jump test , one leg jump test jump 30 second test . The test without infra patellar strap perform use The Optojump measuring system ( Microgate , Bolzano , Italy ) . In addition athlete grade pain severity without infra patellar strap , use The Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) .There follow , data collect one session . Data collect january 2012 december 2012 , data analysis summary study finish december 2013 . Statistical Analysis : In order examine difference test result without infra patellar strap , dependent t- test perform . Significant level set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
