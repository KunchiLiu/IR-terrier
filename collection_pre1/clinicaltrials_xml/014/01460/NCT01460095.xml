	<brief_summary>Glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) best surrogate average blood glucose control diabetic patient . Large-scale study USA UK demonstrate lower HbA1c significantly reduce diabetes complication . Moreover , immediate feedback HbA1c measurement patient improve control . However , HbA1c unavailable part Africa , continent one high burden diabetes . To translate evidence , investigator provide affordable access HbA1c measurement relevant education 2 African country aim significant improvement diabetes control . The investigator develop local health authority , train cost-recovery scheme long-term sustainability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective determine whether introduction routine affordable HbA1c determination immediate feedback patient relevant education underserved population without intervention drug supply would significantly improve diabetes control . As after-versus-before type study , patient control . Study set The study undertake 10 exist diabetes care centre two country , include 4 regional center Guinea , West African country 10 million inhabitant , 6 regional center Cameroon , Central African country 18 million inhabitant . The health district cover Guinea Conakry , Labe , Kankan Boke situate different ecological cultural area . In Cameroon , health district cover Biyem Assi Yaound√© , Garoua , Limbe , Ebolowa , Bamenda , Bafoussam also cover 4 ecological zone Cameroon . All health district exist diabetes care centre train personnel run public hospital price medicine affordable population cover . However , none center HbA1c machine , diabetes control mainly evaluate use blood glucose , often fast . Target population The aim provide service patient follow select center low cost however first eligible 1000 patient include formal intervention free charge . Eligibility All patient physician-confirmed diagnosis diabetes follow diabetes centre least one year eligible Sample size In order detect difference 1 unit ( 1 % glycated haemoglobin ) sample standard deviation 1.2 % , alpha coefficient 0.001 0.8 power use two-sided test , minimum population 80 subject require . The minimum sample size alpha 0.01 55 subject . We therefore decide sample size 100 patient per centre order able analyze data take account center physician effect . It thus give overall sample size 1000 subject . Sampling method We use systematic sampling , enrol consecutive eligible patient volunteer participate completion sample size individual centre . Inclusion All eligible patient , intend migrate study site within 1 year , volunteer participate enrol . At inclusion follow record demographic characteristic , past medical history , characteristic diabetes , evaluation patient knowledge , measurement anthropometric characteristic , blood pressure , haematocrit , HbA1c , urinary albumin excretion baseline . Intervention follow : Data collect use clinical record form designate effect . The intervention consist measurement HbA1c baseline , 3 , 6 month immediate feedback patient provision target education determination , level , significance , target . Treatment follow usual guideline additional intervention . Adjustment treatment do health care personnel treat-to-target fashion . No change drug supply introduce . No specific recommendation give concern frequency hospital visit study visit baseline , month 3 , 6 , 12 . Each centre continue usual follow frequency . At month 12 , repeat evaluation patient knowledge , measurement anthropometric characteristic , blood pressure , haematocrit , HbA1c , urinary albumin excretion comparison baseline . Timeframe - Start date : Month 7 - End enrollment : Month 12 - End follow-up last patient enrol : Month 24 Outcome measure Primary outcome : Change HbA1c baseline 12 month Secondary outcome : - Change percentage patient HbA1c target baseline 12 month - Change urinary albumin excretion baseline 12 month The measure serve interpretation data Deliverables - Dataset centre Month 24 Month 26</detailed_description>
