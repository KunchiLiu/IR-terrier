	<brief_summary>The aim current study improve outcome patient hematologic malignancy ( phase I trial ) specifically multiple myeloma ( phase II trial ) 2 intervention : reduce risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) improve efficacy procedure decrease risk relapse transplant . Currently , standard approach use center prevent graft-versus-host disease allogeneic transplantation base combination calcineurin inhibitor ( cyclosporine tacrolimus ) plus short course methotrexate . Unfortunately , strategy far ideal , since risk acute GVHD range 30-40 % among patient receive match related donor transplantation even high among patient receive transplantation unrelated donor incidence chronic GVHD 60-70 % among patient receive peripheral blood progenitor cell either relate unrelated donor . As far patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) concern , although development new drug markedly change outcome management patient , allogeneic transplantation far appear curative option , especially among patient relapse first line treatment . Nevertheless , still new strategy within allogeneic transplant setting need improve result . Relapses may occur either extramedullary ( common setting ) systemic . In order reduce risk systemic relapse investigator use maintenance therapy Lenalidomide ( Len ) , together bortezomib ( Bz ) contribute eradicate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . In case patient obtain complete remission near complete remission transplant , addition maintenance therapy , investigator use four intensification cycle VRD ( Bz-Len-Dexamethasone ) . In summary , goal optimize efficacy allogeneic transplantation two intervention : one focus reduce risk relapse reduce incidence GVHD .</brief_summary>
