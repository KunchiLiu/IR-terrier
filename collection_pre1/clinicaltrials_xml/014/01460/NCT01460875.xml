	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study recombinant interferon alfa-2b treating patient melanoma . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether selection optimal IFN-alpha-2b ( recombinant interferon alfa-2b ) dose make use signal transduction data . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability adjuvant IFN-alpha-2b administer optimize dose term toxicity observe ability patient receive full year therapy . II . The transcription panel IFN-alpha-induced gene previously identify microarray analysis determine Real-Time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT PCR ) order correlation signal transducer activator transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) phosphorylation IFN-alpha gene regulation evaluate . III . Microarray analysis patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) use evaluate effect dose-reduction IFN-alpha gene expression . IV . In order define clinical role tumor sensitivity IFN-alpha , patient tumor biopsy take prior administration IFN-alpha systematically evaluate cellular level janus kinase ( Jak ) -STAT signal intermediate . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) thrice weekly . Treatment continue 11 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
