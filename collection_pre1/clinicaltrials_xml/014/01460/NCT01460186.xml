	<detailed_description>The StoRM trial design analysis association SIGNAL study aim decipher genetic risk breast cancer display amplification HER2 gene well resistance toxicity adjuvant treatment . SIGNAL study process recruit 6000 localized breast cancer patient . The purpose StoRM trial create cohort 1500 patient metastatic breast cancer include detailed epidemiologic treatment data . Using germ line polymorphism patient compare patient localized cancer SIGNAL study , investigator answer question specific genetic influence prognosis breast cancer response treatment metastatic phase . Blood sample collect one 6 ml EDTA one 6 ml ACD tube inform consent inclusion study . To simplify evolution study avoid confusion , sample collection procedure follow identical use SIGNAL study . As sample receive biological resource center , plasma aliquoted 500 µl tube frozen -80° C. DNA extract use standard protocol . Plasma DNA store anticipation genetic analysis . An aliquot DNA sample genotyped panel high-density genetic marker cover whole genome , genome-wide association study . The collected plasma may also use analysis determine expression profile protein , alone combine genetic factor allow distinguish group patient .</detailed_description>
