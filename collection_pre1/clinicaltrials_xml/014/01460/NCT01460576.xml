	<brief_summary>The goal IMPROV identify molecular mechanism contribute lung injury long-term breathing problem preterm infant investigate two interrelated biochemical pathway : urea cycle-nitric oxide pathway glutathione pathway . The investigator hypothesize prematurity-related limitation function important biochemical pathway contribute respiratory disease risk first year life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal IMPROV/PROP study identify biomarkers ( biochemical , physiological genetic ) clinical variable associate thus potentially predictive pulmonary status preterm infant 1 year correct age . IMPROV test hypothesis biochemical immaturity functional genetic variation urea cycle-nitric oxide ( UC-NO ) glutathione ( GSH ) pathways influence development severity bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , form chronic lung disease affect 10,000 premature infant year US . IMPROV also test hypothesis duration degree NO insufficiency free radical excess predicts BPD severity correlate persistence lung problem NICU discharge . Our hypothesis implicates ( ) immature liver gastrointestinal ability make citrulline GSH , ( b ) inadequacy nutritional amino acid substrate ( c ) common genetic variation UC-NO GSH pathways pathogenesis BPD . These factor limit ability anatomically functionally immature lung respond physiologic environmental stress preterm birth . As part PROP multi-center study , novel approach characterize lung status non-invasive respiratory measure prior NICU discharge employ . A composite primary outcome morbidity base serial parental report respiratory symptom , medication , hospitalization dependence technology first year life develop .</detailed_description>
