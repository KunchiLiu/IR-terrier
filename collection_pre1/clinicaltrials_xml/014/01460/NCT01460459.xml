	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The objective study investigate effect specific frequency Self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) glycemic control quality life patient type 2 diabetes stable good glycemic control use 1 insulin injection daily . The research question : Does less intensive frequency SMBG insulin-treated patient type 2 diabetes , stable good glycemic control , use 1 insulin injection daily , lead clinically relevant increase HbA1c ( increase 0.5 % ) effect quality life ? Secondary objective : The secondary objective investigate effect specific frequency SMBG number hypo hyper glycaemia , number extra diabetes-related contact health care provider , diabetes medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-monitoring Blood Glucose Insulin-treated Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Rationale : Self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) important tool diabetes care achieve maintain good glycemic control . But often 'should ' patient measure capillary glucose concentration ? There general agreement professional , evidence specific frequency timing . Objective : The objective study investigate effect specific frequency SMBG glycemic control quality life patient type 2 diabetes stable good glycemic control use 1 insulin injection daily . Study design : An open Randomised Controlled Trial . Study population : Patients insulin-treated diabetes type 2 , &gt; 18 year age , use 1 insulin injection daily , perform SMBG &gt; 1 year , HbA1c ≤ 58 mmol/mol ( &lt; 7.5 % ) precede 12 month , sufficient knowledge Dutch language , hypo-unawareness , serious co-morbidity Intervention : Patients instructed measure blood glucose concentration 4 time per day ( pre-prandial bedtime ) one day weekly group A , one day per two week group B one day monthly group C. Patients ask keep diary reading probably extra measurement , include reason . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter glycemic control quality life . A difference &gt; 0.5 % ( &gt; 5.5 mmol/mol ) HbA1c consider relevant . Quality life measure 3 validated questionnaire . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients study use perform SMBG . During study , ask monitor glucose concentration control , specific frequency ( different kind usual care compare ) . And ask fill 3 questionnaire begin end study . Extra HbA1c measurement necessary . No side effect expect , safety incorporate HbA1c measurement every 3 month every 3 month diary discuss schedule visit . Furthermore , extra measurement allow necessary .</detailed_description>
