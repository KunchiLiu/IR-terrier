	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGBP ) common type surgery length stay morbidity intimately associate post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) recovery bowel function . Medications commonly use control post-operative pain opioid medication , whose well know adverse effect include PONV . Currently , study adequate alternative opiate exist mild-moderate pain relief without aforementioned risk . The primary goal study evaluate administration pre- post-operative IV acetaminophen determine overall decrease use opioid analgesic patient control analgesia ( PCA ) subsequent decrease subjective PONV lead sooner return bowel function , enable progression oral intake decrease post-operative length stay .</brief_summary>

The advent IV acetaminophen serve opportunity investigate detail efficacy non-opioid medication management acute pain immediate post-operative period without aforementioned adverse effect expect traditional opiate medication . A comprehensive approach study include prospective , double-blinded , randomize control trial subject undergo LRYGBP randomize study agent ( IV acetaminophen ) placebo .</detailed_description>
