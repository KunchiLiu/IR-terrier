	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Tadalafil Once-Daily Asian Men With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tadalafil investigate treatment men sign symptom benign prostatic hyperplasia [ BPH ; also refer urinary disturbance BPH-LUTS ( BPH-lower urinary tract symptom ) ] Japan overseas . Overseas study Japanese dose-finding study LVIA ( NCT00783094 ) identify tadalafil 5 mg once-daily recommend dose . The long-term safety maintenance effect confirm open-label extension study LVIA . The risk-benefit profile study Asian study LVHB ( NCT00861757 ) . This study , LVJF , confirm efficacy safety tadalafil 5 mg once-daily Asian men BPH-LUTS .</detailed_description>
