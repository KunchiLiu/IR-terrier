	<brief_summary>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) use modulate neuronal excitability patient depression . In present study investigator examine whether medial frontal rTMS use double-cone-coil prof superior conventional high-frequency-rTMS apply left-sided prefrontal cortex butterfly-coil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness rTMS With Double-Cone-Coil Patients With Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression common mental disorder present depress mood , loss interest , feeling guilt low self-worth , disturbed sleep appetite , low energy level poor concentration . These problem become chronic recurrent lead substantial impairment individual 's ability take care everyday 's responsibility , bad , depression lead suicide . Depression reliably diagnose primary care . Antidepressant medication brief , structure form psychotherapy effective 60-80 % affect delivered primary care . In patient depression cerebral metabolism derange specific area hypoexcitability frontal cortical area . High-frequency rTMS dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) investigate treatment hypoexcitability disorder . Mild antidepressant effect rTMS apply left side dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) use standard butterfly coil possibly increase different stimulation protocol medial frontal cortex use double-cone-coil . First hint effectiveness treatment arise case report therefore need replication comparability conventional stimulation protocol . In present study investigator examine whether medial frontal rTMS use double-cone-coil prof effective conventional high-frequency-rTMS apply left-sided prefrontal cortex butterfly-coil .</detailed_description>
