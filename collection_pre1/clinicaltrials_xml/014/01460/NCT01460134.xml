	<brief_summary>This study CDX-1127 , therapy target immune system may act promote anti-cancer effect . The study enroll patient hematologic cancer ( certain leukemias lymphoma ) , well patient select type solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CDX-1127 ( Varlilumab ) Patients With Select Solid Tumor Types Hematologic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-1127 fully human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call CD27 find certain immune cell also certain hematologic tumor cell may act promote anti-tumor effect . This study evaluate safety activity escalate dos CDX-1127 patient B-cell T-cell hematologic malignancy know express CD27 solid tumor likely responsive immune system . Eligible patient enroll dose escalation portion study assign one 5 dose level CDX-1127 . This first phase study test safety profile CDX-1127 ass dose test future study . During Expansion phase , cohorts approximately 15 patient receive study treatment continue evaluate safety profile CDX-1127 determine effect cancer . Expansion cohort may limit one tumor type . Patients enrol study may receive study treatment 5 cycle , disease progress necessary stop treatment safety reason . All patient enrol study closely monitored determine cancer respond treatment side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
