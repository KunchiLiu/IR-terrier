	<brief_summary>A research study rectal cancer perfusion ( blood flow rectum time ) . We hope learn whether perfusion characteristic rectal mass may predictive response treatment whether rectal perfusion characteristic use follow response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perfusion CT Predictor Treatment Response Patients With Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent advance compute tomography ( CT ) technology make CT perfusion image feasible assessment tumor perfusion solid tumor abdomen . CT perfusion show promising result serve noninvasive method predict response therapy cancer patient . CT perfusion parameter also find correlate immunohistologic marker angiogenesis number solid tumor , suggest possible role CT perfusion noninvasive biomarker tumor angiogenesis . The goal investigator study twofold : first , determine relationship baseline CT perfusion characteristic rectal cancer response treatment , second , determine perfusion CT use subsequently monitor tumor response treatment . The investigator hope enroll patient locally advanced rectal cancer undergo standard CT pre-treatment planning , integrate CT perfusion image current abdomen/pelvis image protocol close clinical radiologic follow-up treatment determine response therapy time disease progression .</detailed_description>
