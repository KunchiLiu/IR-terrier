	<brief_summary>This 2 part study . The goal first part clinical research study find high tolerable dose azacitidine give TKI already take ( Gleevec , Sprycel , Tasigna ) . The safety drug also study . The goal second part see combination may improve response TKI already take . Azacitidine design change gene think cause leukemia . By change gene , drug may help stop cause disease grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine ( AZA ) Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , continue receive TKI dose receive last 6 month . You receive azacitidine either injection skin vein every day 3 7 day 28-day cycle . The dose often take drug depend enter study . The study staff tell often receive drug . In first part study , assign dose level azacitidine base join study . Up 2 dose level azacitidine test . At least 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . The next group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose azacitidine find . This call Dose Escalation Group . Once high tolerate dose find , extra 36 participant receive azacitidine dose level . This called Expansion Group . If severe side effect study drug , study doctor may decide reduce and/or stop drug dose side effect improve . If doctor think best interest , dose may increase . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect list drug may take . - Every 1-2 week 8 week , start every cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Every 2-4 week 8 week , cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) also draw test kidney liver function . - Before cycle 3 cycle , every 3-6 cycle 1 year , every 6-12 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn molecular testing . - Every 3-6 month Year 1 , often doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . - If Expansion Group , every 3 month ( +/- 1 month ) first 6 month , every 6-12 month , complete physical exam . - If Dose Escalation Group , every 2 week first month , Months 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 ( +/- 1 month ) , every 6-12 month , complete physical exam . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . This investigational study . TKIs approve treatment CML . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment patient MDS . The combination drug treat CML investigational . Up 48 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 16 year old Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) BCR/ABLpositive CML ( determine cytogenetics , FISH , PCR ) . 2 . Patients must receive FDAapproved TKI therapy least 18 month increase dose FDAapproved TKI last 6 month . Patients participate frontline protocol 20050048 ( nilotinib ) 20050422 ( dasatinib ) eligible enrollment study . 3 . Phase II patient must complete cytogenetic remission . For phase I portion study , patient may include without complete cytogenetic remission provide chronic phase . 4 . Phase II patient must detectable BCRABL transcript level meet least one follow criterion : Patient never achieve major molecular response , transcript level show least two consecutive measure separate least 1 month increase value , Achieved major molecular response lose increase transcript level least 1log , confirm two consecutive analysis separate least 1 month , The patient receive therapy least 2 year sustain major molecular response , The patient receive therapy least 5 year sustain complete molecular response . Patients include phase I portion study eligible regardless level BCRABL transcript . 5 . Patients must know continuous interruption imatinib therapy great 14 day total 6 week 6 month prior enrollment . 6 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . 7 . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . 8 . Adequate organ function define : bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( unless associate Gilbert 's syndrome ) , ALT AST &lt; /= 2.5x ULN . 9 . ANC &gt; /=1 x10 ( 9 ) /L platelet &gt; /= 50 x10 ( 9 ) /L . 10 . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dL creatinine clearance great equal 40 cc/min define CockcroftGault Equation* . Males ( mL/min ) : ( 140age ) * ABW ( kg ) / 72* ( serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) ) ; Females ( mL/min ) :0.85* ( 140age ) * ABW ( kg ) / 72* ( serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) ) 11 . Women childbearing potential advise avoid become pregnant practice effective method contraception . Men advise father child receive treatment azacitidine . Azacitidine classify Pregnancy Category D. Females childbearing potential : Recommendation 2 effective contraceptive method study . Adequate form contraception doublebarrier method ( condom spermicidal jelly foam diaphragm spermicidal jelly foam ) , oral , depo provera , injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device , tubal ligation . Male patient female partner childbearing potential : Recommendation male partner use least 2 effective contraceptive method , describe , study . 12 . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test within 7 day initiation study drug . 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . 2 . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . 3 . Patients clinically significant heart disease ( NYHA Class III IV ) . 4 . Known suspected hypersensitivity azacitidine mannitol . 5 . Patients advance malignant hepatic tumor .</criteria>
