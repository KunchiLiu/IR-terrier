	<brief_summary>This observational retrospective healthcare medical record review study evaluate differentiate clinical characteristic outcome peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient either endotoxin-associated sterile peritonitis ( e-SP ) , bacterial peritonitis ( BP ) peritonitis ( NoP ) 12-15 month period dialysis clinic The Netherlands , Germany , Hungary , Portugal , United Kingdom ( UK ) . The primary study objective : - Describe change peritoneal membrane function clinical outcome time e-SP , BP NoP PD patient . - Describe differentiate clinical characteristic acute clinical presentation e-SP BP . The secondary study objective : - Generate dataset facilitate post hoc exploratory hypothesis-generation related clinical resource utilisation ( RU ) outcomes association e-SP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>e-STEPS observational , non-interventional , retrospective review study healthcare medical record conduct PD unit approximately 12 site The Netherlands , Germany , Hungary , Portugal , UK . There study drug medical intervention involve . Furthermore , patient-identifying information transfer Study Coordinating Centre ( SCC ) sponsor . Medical record case e-SP , BP NoP meet propose study selection criterion select approximately 12 study site identify across 5 European country . Each case identify site study staff potentially eligible enrollment study enter case disposition log ( CDL ) assign unique site-specific study identification number . These case consider study sample frame . The SCC select preliminary target cohort subject sample frame select e-SP case undertake random sample NoP BP case within site ensure 1:1:1 enrollment ratio 3 study group . In event sampling frame give site contain less NoP BP case compare e-SP case , NoP BP case select enrollment study additional case randomly select another site within country make deficit sampling frame allow . Sampling within site alternatively within country ensure NoP case match e-SP case lot recall PD solution . Cases within The Netherlands , Portugal UK use recall lot PD solution . Therefore , within site within country sample achieve , across country sample undertaken 3 country . If determine e-SP NoP case sample frame CAPD time index event , BP case identify sample frame APD time index event may exclude selection process ( may select comprise preliminary target cohort ) would therefore enrolled study . Local site study staff review medical record case include preliminary target cohort confirm eligibility . Those case meet eligibility criterion comprise final study cohort enrol study subject . Pseudonymised data subject ' medical record abstract local site study staff enter site secure pass-word protected electronic data capture ( EDC ) system . No patient-identifying information available non-site staff ; ( i.e. , representative SCC study sponsor ) . Over course study , data enter , case status page within EDC system automatically update study disposition case . As data automatically quality control point data entry EDC system basis program validation rule study variable , quality control query resolution manage remotely . Therefore , site data monitor visit SCC envision . No patient-identifying information enter EDC system ; , neither SCC study sponsor able identify subject actual patient .</detailed_description>
