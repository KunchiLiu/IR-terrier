	<detailed_description>The study open-label extension study , offer patient participate complete previous study 901 910 ( extension 901 ) continue treatment DiaPep277 clinical follow-up , 2 additional years.The aim study collect safety efficacy data long term treatment effect Diapep277.Only patient complete study 901 910 still stimulate C-peptide level equal 0.2 nmol/L eligible extension study . The optimal dose dose regimen study apply phase 3 study ( 901 ) extension study protocol ( 910 ) , namely 1.0 mg DiaPep277® administer every 3 month . These condition determine optimal base outcome phase 2 study . For patient complete 2-year 901 study , 3-year extend treatment offer 13 administration ; patient complete 2-year 910 extension study offer 3rd year treatment 5 additional administration .</detailed_description>
