	<brief_summary>Transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) common cause transfusion-related morbidity mortality United States . It common often unrecognized critically ill great incidence occur bleed patient liver disease . Plasma blood component associate deadly complication therefore patient liver disease frequently receive transfused plasma increase risk . The optimal plasma transfusion strategy bleed patient liver disease unknown investigator evaluate clinical question small pilot randomize control trial . The invstigators hypothesize targetting restrictive INR Target ( 2.5 ) vs. INR Target ( 1.8 ) result less hypoxemia , TRALI surrogate without increase bleed complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances understand coagulation imbalance liver disease expert question clinical efficacy current plasma transfusion practice patient liver disease . Having recently discover large previously unrecognized risk ( TRALI ) plasma transfusion patient population , investigator believe current clinical transfusion paradigm under-recognizes risk overvalues benefit plasma transfusion bleed patient liver disease . Though expert recommend judicious use plasma , clinical practice remain variable . Transfusion trigger threshold often arbitrarily set base conventional coagulation study evidence guide clinicians plasma dosing require achieve laboratory threshold exist . The investigator hypothesize restrictive plasma transfusion strategy critically ill chronic liver disease patient acute gastrointestinal bleeding decrease surrogate measure TRALI without increase bleed complication ( figure 1 ) . With collaborative support pulmonary/critical care , hepatology , transfusion medicine service , investigator conduct randomize controlled trial compare restrictive versus liberal strategy plasma transfusion bleed patient liver disease . In addition , investigator refine validate plasma transfusion dose algorithm clinician tool appropriately dose plasma reach evidence-based transfusion target . The development TRALI believe require two pathophysiologic event . First , pro-inflammatory stimulus , sepsis , lead exposure endothelial surface adhesion proteins consequent capture polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) within pulmonary microvasculature . Second , adherent PMNs activate mediator within transfused blood component , lead neutrophilic inflammation TRALI . Emerging evidence suggest process neutrophil adhesion lung involve degradation endothelial glycocalyx , thin layer glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) line vascular lumen ( S ) . In mouse , sepsis result pulmonary glycocalyx loss , neutrophil adhesion subsequent development ALI ( S ) . Glycocalyx degradation also associate organ injury human , evidence increase circulate GAG fragment ( e.g . heparinoids ) septic shock . Circulating heparinoids detect quickly accurately point care heparinase-I modify thromboelastogram ( TEG ) study26-27 . Detection heparinoids TEG may therefore indicate pulmonary microvasculature propensity PMN adhesion ( first event ) utilize predictive biomarker TRALI . Restrictive plasma transfusion strategy could individualize high risk patient decrease probability second event result clinical syndrome TRALI . In conjunction clinical trial , investigator perform translational observational study ass whether detection systemic heparinoids predict subsequent development TRALI surrogate , post-transfusion hypoxemia . These clinical study pave way large clinical trial guide future plasma transfusion practice decrease significant TRALI burden critically ill .</detailed_description>
