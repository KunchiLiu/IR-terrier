	<brief_title>Research Involving Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease , Alzheimer Disease Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 6 subject Parkinson disease , 6 subject Alzheimer disease 20 healthy control subject recruit participate study . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo bolus injection [ 18F ] CFPyPB follow serial PET imaging scan plasma sample measurement [ 18F ] CFPyPB plasma ( protein bound free ) period 4 hour . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , [ 18F ] CFPyPB . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result PD AD subject compare HC subject . At least 2 week follow initial image visit subject ( 2 PD subject , 2 AD subject 5 HC subject ) may ask return second injection scan procedure evaluate reproducibility image measure use procedure . Subjects may decline participation second scan . Subjects request return second scan enough second scan data collect evaluate imaging outcome measure reproducibility .</detailed_description>
