	<brief_title>Evaluation 18FMPPF Brain Tracer Serotonin Receptor 5HT1a</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 40 subject Parkinson disease 20 healthy control subject recruit participate 2 Projects study . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects Project 1 ( 20 PD 20 HC subject ) ask undergo single bolus injection [ 18F ] MPPF follow serial Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image scan blood sample measurement [ 18F ] MPPF plasma ( protein bound free ) period 2 hour . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , [ 18F ] MPPF . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result PD subject compare HC subject . Subjects participate Project 2 ( 20 PD subject dopaminergic replacement therapy ) also undergo second [ 18F ] MPPF PET image session , identical except PD medication withhold approximately 8 hour prior image session . The second session occur great 7 day , 3 month , first image session . Initial 'on ' medication quantitative outcome brain region compare outcomes second 'off ' medication imaging session determine influence dopaminergic treatment 5HT1A activity . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , [ 18F ] MPPF . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result PD subject compare HC subject .</detailed_description>
