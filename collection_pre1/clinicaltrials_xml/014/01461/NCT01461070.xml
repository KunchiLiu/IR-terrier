	<brief_summary>Background : - Some bacteria find large small intestine help keep people healthy aid digestion . They may also affect person risk develop cancer . Researchers want study relationship intestinal bacteria breast cancer risk factor . They look stool urine sample postmenopausal woman . Objectives : - To study intestinal bacteria relationship urine-based marker breast cancer risk woman . Eligibility : - Women 55 69 year age recent mammogram show sign cancer . Design : - Participants screen medical history basic health questionnaire . - At home , participant complete questionnaire cancer risk factor food consumption . - Participants also collect urine stool sample . They send sample designate labs study . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/Significance : Commensal microbe ( microbiota ) , particularly gut , require human health postulate affect cancer risk several mechanism . This propose study build upon pilot within NCI Division Cancer Epidemiology Genetics ( DCEG ) identify highly acceptable method collect fecal specimen significant correlation fecal microbial beta-glucuronidase activity marker breast cancer risk , urine level estrogen . The propose study determine correlation level fecal enzyme activity systemic estrogen random sample postmenopausal woman Kaiser Permanente Colorado ( KPCO ) . Demonstration association fecal microbiota systemic estrogen would help motivate future study microbes affect cancer risk . Objectives : The main objective characterize fecal microbiota association level systemic estrogen among randomly sample postmenopausal female member health maintenance organization ( HMO ) . A secondary objective determine proportion woman consent provide questionnaire data , fecal specimen characterize microbiota , urine specimen quantify systemic estrogen ; difference participant ( N=60 ) non-participants . A third objective determine whether consecutive , newly diagnose postmenopausal breast cancer case similar participation rate , fecal microbiota characteristic urine estrogen level compare randomly sample woman . Methods : We randomly sample KPCO population approximately 50,000 woman age 55-69 recently negative screening mammogram . An invitation packet ( letter , information pamphlet , consent form , eligibility questionnaire , opt-out postcard ) send batch 100 , maximum 500 woman . The consent woman receive second packet cancer risk-factor questionnaire , link on-line Block brief food frequency questionnaire , specimen collection kit ( illustrated instruction ) collect fecal urine specimen . Participants ( minimum 60 , maximum 80 ) ship specimens DCEG repository . As amended , consecutive newly diagnose breast cancer case ( target N=60 ) enrol oncology clinic prior definitive surgery , eligibility criterion random sample . For contemporaneous control , participant randomly sample , mammogram-negative population recruit back ( target N=60 ) . Urine estrogen quantify DCEG NCI Frederick . Fecal microbial classification enzymatic expression activity perform University Maryland Medical School ( UMMS ) . Analyses : Data analyze summarize publication representative KPCO , DCEG UMMS . Simple proportion use estimate participation rate . Extant electronic record KPCO use compare participant non-participants , overall pre-specified subgroup ( 5-year age group , race/ethnicity , length KPCO enrollment ) , descriptive statistic logistic regression . For primary objective , fecal microbial 16S rRNA pyrosequences classify phylogenetic principal component analysis , estrogen level Beta-glucuronidase RNA expression enzymatic activity level categorize use log standard deviation . The study 80 % power detect 17 % increase estrogen level per 2.4-fold increase glucuronidase activity 80 % power detect 3-fold case-control difference above-median microbiome alpha diversity .</detailed_description>
