	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety immunogenecity third MVA HIVIS 03 volunteer receive 3 HIVIS DNA vaccine follow boost 2 MVA vaccine . The investigator postulate Immune response observe HIVIS 03 trial likely wane time . To date unknown response best maintain . In study investigator seek boost immune response , especially antibody response induce second MVA boost . Since HIV specific antibody induce second MVA injection , hypothesize 3rd MVA give rise even higher sustain antibody titer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Have complete HIVIS03/TaMoVac01 WP1 protocol receive active vaccine 2 . Willing undergo counseling HIV test 3 . Are infected HIV infection indicate negative PCR reaction HIV . 4 . Able give inform consent 5 . Resident Dar e Salaam , willing remain duration study 6 . At low risk HIV infection , define absence identifiable risk factor/ behavior : sexual partner HIV sexual partner unknown HIV serostatus also unwilling use protective condom consistently sexual relation sexual partner know high risk HIV one sexual partner last 6 month . history alcoholic [ medically define 35 unit /week ] History STI within past 6 month . 7 . Verbal assurance adequate birth control measure use conceive/father child study 4 month 3rd MVA vaccine injection 8 . Have negative urinary pregnancy test females 9 . ECG find neither pose risk vaccination preclude evaluation peri/myocarditis . 10 . Be willing practice safe sex duration study avoid sexually transmitted infection include HIV . 11 . Good health determine medical history , physical examination , clinical judgment key laboratory parameter Reference range accordance data generate MUHAS hematology value , biochemical parameter . Exclusion presence Diabetes mellitus base WHO cutoff value Fasting Blood Glucose &gt; 7.8 mmol/l No grade 1 high routine laboratory parameter ( see section appendix 3 DAIDS chart Definitions ) . Hence lab parameter follow : Hb &gt; 10.5g/dl White blood cell count &gt; 1,300/mm3 Lymphocytes &gt; 1.0/ mm3 Platelets &gt; 120,000/ mm3 CD4 &gt; 400cells/ mm3 Random Blood Glucose 2.57.0 mmol/L ; elevate , Fasting Blood Glucose &lt; 7.8 mmol/l Bilirubin &lt; 1.25 x uln ALT &lt; 1.25 x uln Creatinine &lt; 1.25 x uln Urine dipstick protein blood : negative trace . ( If either ≥ 1+ , obtain complete urinalysis ( UA ) . If microscopic UA confirm evidence hematuria proteinuria ≥ 1+ , volunteer ineligible ) . 1 . Active tuberculosis systemic infectious process elicit review system , physical examination laboratory detection . Such detection Hepatitis B surface antigen , active syphilis . 2 . Have history immunodeficiency , chronic illness require continuous frequent medical intervention 3 . Autoimmune disease history physical examination . 4 . Severe eczema 5 . Have history psychiatric , medical and/or substance abuse problem past 6 month investigator believe would adversely affect volunteer 's ability participate trial . 6 . History grandmal epilepsy , currently take antiepileptic 7 . Have receive blood blood product immunoglobulins past 3 month . 8 . Are receive immunosuppressive therapy systemic corticosteroid cancer chemotherapy . 9 . Have use experimental therapeutic agent within 30 day study entry . 10 . Have receive live , attenuated vaccine within 60 day study entry . { NOTE : Medically indicate subunit kill vaccine ( e.g. , Hepatitis A Hepatitis B ) exclusionary give least 2 week HIV immunization avoid potential confusion adverse reaction } . 11 . History severe local general reaction vaccination define : Local : Extensive , indurated redness swell involve major circumference arm , resolve within 72 hour General : Fever &gt; = 39.5 0C within 48 hour ; anaphylaxis ; bronchospasm ; laryngeal oedema ; collapse ; convulsion encephalopathy within 72 hour 12 . Are lactate mother 13 . Are study site employee involve protocol may direct access immunogenicity result 14 . Unlikely comply protocol judge principal investigator designate .</criteria>
