	<brief_summary>This study do determine safety outcome ( long-term control ) high-dose chemotherapy regimen follow infusion CD34 select ( immune cell ) stem cell partially match adult family member donor , call haploidentical stem cell transplantation , high-risk sickle cell disease patient . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haplo T-Cell Depleted Transplantation High-Risk Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate host myeloimmunosuppressive conditioning follow familial haploidentical T cell deplete allogeneic stem cell transplantation patient high risk Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . It hypothesize safe well tolerate , result sustain donor chimerism , acceptable engraftment immune reconstitution . Also , limit SCD relate organ damage result improved and/or stable neurological , neurocognitive , pulmonary pulmonary vascular function health relate quality life ( QOL ) . Patients 2-20.99 year age diagnosis high-risk SCD unaffected HLA partially match family donor meeting eligibility criterion ( inclusion exclusion criterion ) eligible .</detailed_description>
