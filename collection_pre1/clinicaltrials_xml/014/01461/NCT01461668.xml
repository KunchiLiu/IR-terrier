	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomize placebo-controlled double-blinded study nasal decolonization retapamulin vs. placebo eradication MRSA nasal carriage among adult carrier low-level ( MIC 8-256 ) high-level mupirocin resistant ( MIC &gt; 256 ) strain . Objectives : 1 . To determine percent intervention vs. control patient successful MRSA nasal decolonization determine bilateral naris swab follow 5-day twice-a-day regimen retapamulin . 2 . To determine time decolonization base upon interim final bilateral naris swab . 3 . To determine acceptability retapamulin survey participant experience adverse event experience study . The duration participant follow-up expect last 7 week . This study evaluate safety effectiveness Altabax ( retapmulin ) decolonization MRSA carrier mupirocin-resistant strain , stratify low-level high-level resistance mupirocin . Mupirocin resistance increasingly common approve substitute topical agent decolonization MRSA nasal reservoir .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate utility retapamulin , topical ointment FDA approve skin infection , novel agent MRSA decolonization prevention healthcare-associated MRSA infection . Retapamulin first-in-class semi-synthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibits protein synthesis interact bacterial ribosome 50S subunit . It receive FDA approval 2007 topical treatment impetigo adult pediatric patient . We propose evaluate retapamulin investigational agent nasal decolonization MRSA carrier whose strain demonstrate low-level high-level resistance mupirocin . Mupirocin resistance increasingly common approve substitute topical agent decolonization MRSA nasal reservoir . We conduct randomize placebo-controlled double-blinded study nasal decolonization retapamulin vs. placebo eradication MRSA nasal carriage among adult carrier low-level ( MIC 8-256 ) high-level mupirocin resistant ( MIC &gt; 256 ) strain . Randomization stratify low vs high level resistance . Consenting adult ( least 18 year old ) subject randomized 1 % retapamulin placebo ointment intra-nasally twice day 5 day ( D1-5 ) follow bilateral naris swab one week follow completion therapy ( ~D12 ) ass clearance . If follow swab positive MRSA , patient give second course agent ( retapamulin placebo ) begin one week follow swab collection ( ~D19-23 ) two decolonization attempt make . A final set bilateral naris swab obtain subject six week completion initial treatment ( ~D47 ) . Consenting adult ( least 18 year old ) subject give retapamulin placebo . At time recruitment , subject complete detailed survey administer trained research staff . This survey include question relate self care , home hygiene practice , know risk factor MRSA acquisition . Subject follow include repeat bilateral naris swab follow survey relate compliance , experience ( side effects/concerns ) assign regimen , ongoing risk factor occur either home visit ( facility visit patient admit hospital nursing home time require visit ) University California Irvine ( UCI ) Institute Clinical Translational Science ( ICTS ) , Clinical Translational Science Award ( CTSA ) site provide clinic visit support pilot study . Outcomes include successful naris decolonization end follow period ( D47 ) . We detail sequence clearance re-colonization base upon two follow naris swab , well adverse event , expect related local irritation small percent subject .</detailed_description>
