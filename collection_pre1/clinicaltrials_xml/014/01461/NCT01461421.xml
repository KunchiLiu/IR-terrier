	<brief_title>Acceptance Based Behavioral Intervention Weight Loss : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity major health problem behavioral weight control program treatment choice mild moderate obesity . However , marked variability among participant weight loss achieve program maximum weight loss typically achieve month 6 , follow weight regain . Thus innovative approach need improve longer-term treatment outcome . Currently , behavioral treatment program offer participant , tailor meet need specific subgroup . One subgroup may need specialized approach report high level internal disinhibition , i.e . eat response negative thought emotion . Over 50 % individual enter behavioral weight loss program report high level internal disinhibition Eating Inventory ( EI ) , subgroup distinct binge eat disorder , importantly , individual lose significantly less weight participant weight loss treatment [ particularly 18 month ] . Thus effort need develop effective treatment subgroup . The propose research significant may help move field `` one size fit '' approach , development intervention specific subgroup population . The investigator hypothesize individual report problem internal disinhibition may achieve good weight loss enhance behavioral weight loss program focus acceptance-based strategy . Whereas standard behavioral treatment teach patient control negative thought technique cognitive restructure distraction , acceptance base strategy teach patient experience thought feeling , without attempt control continue pursue behavioral goal despite experience negative thought feeling . Acceptance-based strategy show helpful number behavioral problem include weight loss maintenance , however yet untested large trial . The current study randomize control trial compare standard behavioral weight loss treatment program incorporate acceptance base strategy treatment overweight/obese individual problem internal disinhibition . A total 160 participant randomly assign standard behavioral weight loss treatment program ( SBT ) innovative approach combine standard behavioral weight loss acceptance base strategy ( referred hereafter `` Acceptance Based Behavioral Intervention '' ABBI ) . Both group meet weekly 6 month , biweekly 3 month monthly 3 month . Assessments conduct baseline 6 month interval 24 month total , measure weight , acceptance negative emotion , distress tolerance , adherence weight loss program . The primary hypothesis participant ABBI program achieve great change weight ( form weight reduction ) 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month compare baseline weight participant SBT . Secondary hypothesis participant ABBI experience great improvement acceptance weight related negative thought emotion distress tolerance well treatment adherence participant SBT .</detailed_description>
