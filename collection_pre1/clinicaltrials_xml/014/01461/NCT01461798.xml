	<brief_summary>Introduction : Cardiovascular disease become leading cause death chronic diseases world . One major risk factor disease hypercholesterolemia , cause case rich-fat diet , come country Benecol ® yogurt , whose active ingredient plant stanol ester compete total cholesterol low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol prevent absorb body reduce blood level . Objective : To evaluate efficacy plant stanol ester Benecol ® yogurt lower blood lipid moderately hypercholesterolemic patient treat CES Clinic 2011 . Methods : A randomized crossover clinical trial , double-blind , placebo-controlled study patient 20 50 year moderate hypercholesterolemia care CES control clinic Medellin . Expected result : Test effectiveness plant stanol ester reduce total cholesterol LDL cholesterol patient moderate hypercholesterolemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main cause death worldwide cardiovascular disease , generate mainly disturbance lipid profile . Several study show dyslipidemia important risk factor condition , thus maintain level lipid appropriate range ideal prevent cardiovascular disease ( 1 ) Cardiovascular disease serious epidemiological problem contemporary world , approximately 17 million people die year cause myocardial infarction stroke . The increase cardiovascular disease mortality attributable topic widely report several author world . In Colombia death violent cause , cardiovascular disease second five leading cause mortality general population . Having high total cholesterol risk factor occurrence various disease circulatory system , therefore important keep total cholesterol 200 mg / dl LDL cholesterol level 150 mg/dl , avoid accumulation fat within wall artery lead formation atherosclerotic plaque cause decrease blood flow The atlas publish WHO 2005 provide comprehensive data morbidity mortality attributable noncommunicable disease , increase . It estimate 2001 approximately 60 % 56.5 million death worldwide 46 % disease due noncommunicable disease . The epidemiological burden disease increase 57 % year 2020 . Almost 50 % death due noncommunicable disease due cardiovascular disease . By 2020 , diseases responsible 75 % death worldwide . Given high prevalence cardiovascular disease dyslipidemia consider high risk factor occur , necessary test effectiveness include consumption plant stanol ester diet low cholesterol value Total LDL Cholesterol .</detailed_description>
