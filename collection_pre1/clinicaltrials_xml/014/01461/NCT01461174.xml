	<brief_title>Effects Donepezil Memantine Cognitive Functions After Sleep Deprivation Challenge Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : With inherent difficulty detect significant improvement cognitive performance normal healthy subject , presently incredibly hard predict select efficacious agent early drug development process . As potential success novel therapeutic agent symptomatic relief Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) largely unknown drug enter relatively large study , assess clinical outcome least six month period . To try overcome issue , clinical scientist focus attention development cognitive endpoints/biomarkers detect number experimental paradigms cognitive impairment akin observe AD , artificially induced.Based scientific literature , use total Sleep Deprivation healthy volunteer seem good paradigm assess potential anti-AD agent . It first multicenter study combine 3 complementary approach via standardization sleep deprivation model : cognitive evaluation , image neurophysiology . STUDY OBJECTIVE ( S ) Primary : The study aim assess utility sleep deprivation potential model prediction clinical efficacy use combination cognitive physiological endpoint . The main goal test effect donepezil memantine treatment cognitive function young healthy deprive subject assess potential restore effect two drug cognitive function induce sleep deprivation . Secondary : - To assess Sleep Deprivation model result cognitive impairment - To determine sensitivity model test restore effect one single dose modafinil - To investigate reversal effect modafinil EEG sleep deprivation . - To investigate reversal effect modafinil fMRI acquisition sleep deprivation ( subject include Toulouse fMRI ) - To investigate influence donepezil memantine EEG sleep deprivation . - To investigate influence donepezil memantine fMRI acquisition sleep deprivation ( subject include Toulouse fMRI ) . STUDY DESIGN The study phase I , multicentric ( Lille , Marseille , Toulouse ) , randomise , placebo-controlled , cross-over design . STUDY POPULATION Healthy young male subject 25 40 years-old ( 36 subject randomize ) PRIMARY ENDPOINT ( S ) AND MAIN SECONDARY ENDPOINT ( S ) Primary endpoint : N-back test Secondary endpoint : - Other cognitive assessment - Imaging - Neurophysiology</detailed_description>
