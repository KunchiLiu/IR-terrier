	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Cryoablation Palliation Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients painful bone metastases meet eligibility criterion determine appropriate candidate cryoablation therapy offer enrollment study . Cryoablation process destroy tissue application extremely cold temperature . Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems use surgical tool field general surgery , dermatology ( skin ) , neurology ( nerve ) , chest surgery ( include lung ) , Ears-Nose-Throat ( ENT ) , gynecology , oncology ( cancer ) , proctology ( colon/rectal ) urology ( kidney ) . Patients agree participate read sign inform consent form thus become subject study . Treatment perform use Galil Medical cryoablation system Galil Medical cryoablation needle . Subjects follow 24 week ( 6 month ) palliation pain , quality life analgesic usage . Baseline follow-up data collect subject via web-based electronic data collection tool .</detailed_description>
