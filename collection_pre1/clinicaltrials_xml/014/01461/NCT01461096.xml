	<brief_title>Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine Prevent Anal HPV HIV-infected Men Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anal HPV infection risk factor anal cancer , common non-AIDS-defining cancer among HIV-infected MSM . Screening anal cancer widely available difficult implement . People receive FDA-approved quadrivalent HPV vaccine , Gardasil , may reduce risk develop anal HPV infection , may turn reduce risk develop anal cancer . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness quadrivalent HPV vaccine , Gardasil , reduce incidence anal HPV infection HIV-infected MSM HIV-infected woman . This study enrol HIV-infected MSM HIV-infected woman . Participants randomly assign receive HPV vaccine placebo vaccine . At screen study visit , participant underwent physical examination , blood collection , anal swab procedure , oral examination , questionnaire , high-resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) , female , pregnancy test , vaginal swab , gynecologic exam . At entry study visit , participant underwent procedure perform screen ( exception HRA gynecologic exam female ) plus saliva test . Participants receive HPV vaccine placebo injection upper arm thigh Day 0 Weeks 8 24 . Study staff call participant 2 3 day vaccination follow-up monitoring . Additional study visit procedure occur Week 28 , Week 52 , every 26 week thereafter least 3 year maximum 4 year last participant enrol study . Female participant also gynecologic exam screening , Week 52 , every 52 week thereafter ; pregnancy test screening , baseline , Week 8 , Week 24 , indicate ; self-collected vaginal swab screening , entry , Week 28 , Week 52 , every 26 week thereafter . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) collect participant entry , Week 28 , study exit . The DSMB hold total four review study . After careful review outcome data 4th review hold September 2 , 2015 , DSMB commend study team well-run study provide important result recommend stop study early due futility . The recommendation base meeting pre-specified criterion inadequate conditional power detect treatment difference 50 % information . The study prematurely discontinue December 31 , 2015 , around eight month earlier originally plan . With approval SASC , study team manage offer high resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) procedures participant whose recent anal Pap test show abnormal result , unless HRA take place 09/01/14 .</detailed_description>
