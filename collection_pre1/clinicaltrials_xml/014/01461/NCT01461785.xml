	<brief_title>The Use Activated Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) Human Autologous Fat Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue augmentation mean lipofilling nowadays frequently use technique form plastic surgery . In aesthetic facial surgery show increase rejuvenate effect , reconstructive surgery earn place correction soft tissue defect athropy . Post-operative loss volume transplant fat remains uncertain factor procedure . In current literature , three main hypothesis etiology postoperative decrease graft volume ; 1 : viability inject fat cell 2 : impaired graft revascularization target site 3 : degree fibrosis target area . Mentioned factor limited application ( large ) volume lipotransfer . Positive effect lipofilling skin quality report . Coleman observe soften wrinkle , decrease pore size pigmentation improvement graft site . Possible mechanism claim regenerative property lipograft explain high number adipose derive stem cell . Although frequently describe literature , objective result publish date . In prospective study investigator examine new method prevent postoperative volume loss addition Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) , derive patient blood , inject fat graft . The added PRP contains wide range growth factor instance : Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , Platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF-AA ) , Transforming growth factor ( TGF-B1 , TGF-B2 ) , Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . All previously mention factor show play key role tissue regeneration tissue damage . Especially VEGF great interest ability promote neo-angiogenesis graft , thus , theory , reduce fat necrosis seroma formation . Current , scientifically validate , use PRP include treatment chronic soft tissue ulceration , application periodontal oral surgery , maxillofacial surgery , orthopaedic trauma surgery , cosmetic plastic surgery , spinal surgery , heart bypass surgery , burn . In mentioned application , PRP show positive influence tissue recovery regeneration . Local PRP application damage animal human skin show regenerative property . Structural change dermal layer observed biopsy . In prospective , randomized clinical trial , lipofilling midface PRP compare lipofilling midface without PRP . The main objective study investigate effect addition PRP autologous fat transfer local skin quality improvement , graft survival , recovery procedure . The synergy achieve lipofilling PRP may hold many future application reconstructive aesthetic plastic surgery . Current limitation lipofilling , especially large volume lipo transfer ( allow reconstruction one procedure stead multiple small volume ) lipofilling pour vascularise tissue ( eg . fibrosis radiation therapy ) may counter addition PRP . Furthermore , suggest local skin improvement could use scar revision burn treatment future , bypass invasive surgery .</detailed_description>
