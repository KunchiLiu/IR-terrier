	<detailed_description>Ischemia reperfusion injury may attenuate HO-1 induction . Heme arginate show protective effect prolong ischemia animal study . The investigator previous data confirm strong HO-1 induction follow heme arginate infusion healthy human . Therefore , investigator next approach evaluate direct effect heme arginate short time Ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury healthy human . This do follow surrogate marker IR injury . Functional blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure alteration tissue oxygenation high spatial temporal resolution . This non-invasive method therefore represent promise technique evaluate effect HO-1 induction energy metabolism oxygen saturation ischemic stress short time reperfusion skeletal muscle . As additional outcome , level myoglobin creatine-kinase measure plasma accord standard laboratory procedure .</detailed_description>
