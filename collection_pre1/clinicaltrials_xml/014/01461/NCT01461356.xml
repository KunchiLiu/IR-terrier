	<detailed_description>In order assign patient specific treatment group unbiased manner , randomization occur prior surgery . The assigned treatment code patient group generate computerized randomization program develop department biostatistics , take account factor age , sex BMI . After patient meet entrance criterion , give full inform consent participate study , randomly assign one treatment group . Patient randomization perform clinic visit surgery schedule , typically occur 1-3 day prior surgery . The patient enrol functional recovery measurement subset consecutive series randomly assign patient 20 patient assign two study arm . Operative Procedures The mini-subvastus approach medial parapatellar approach two surgical approach study respect gait analysis , activity level thigh strength . A cemented condylar implant , FDA approve device , use case study . The difference two treatment group surgical approach insert component . These two surgical approach comprise two study arm describe detail . Minisubvastus approach : The skin incision make superior pole patella top tibial tubercle typically measure 3.5 inch extension . The MIS subvastus approach amenable stepwise surgeon learning , recommend surgeon start traditional 6- 8-in incision shorten incision length gain familiarity subvastus exposure . The medial skin flap elevate clearly delineate inferior border vastus medialis obliquus ( VMO ) muscle . The inferior border VMO almost always find inferior medial surgeon anticipate . This anatomy consistent , tendon inferior edge VMO attach 50 degree angle attache midpole patella . It important save edge tendon retractor rest VMO muscle protect throughout case . Incise cautery along inferior edge VMO midpole patella ( tempt cheat superiorly hinder , help , ultimate exposure ) . The proximal limb incision , parallel inferior edge VMO , make 508 angle relative long axis femur . After intersect midpole patella incision direct straight distally along medial border patellar tendon inferior border tibial tubercle . A narrow 90 degree bent Homan retractor place lateral gutter rest robust edge VMO tendon preserve exposure . The patella completely retract , surprisingly little force , lateral gutter . The knee flex 90 degree provide excellent exposure distal femur . If patella slide easily lateral gutter maneuver typically portion medial patellofemoral ligament remain attached patella usually proximal limb arthrotomy make horizontal fashion rather 50 degree angle parallel VMO . The distal femur prepare narrow version standard intramedullary resection guide . By bring knee 60 degree flexion anterior portion distal femur visualize well . This position also relaxes skin anterior femur make easy retract . If small skin incision use , distal femur cut one condyle time intramedullary portion cut guide leave place added stability . If slightly long skin incision use , distal cut guide pin place condyle cut standard fashion . The tibia prepare next do provide work room subsequently size rotate femoral component ( difficult part MIS TKA ) . Good exposure entire surface tibia accomplish 3 retractor place precisely : pickle-fork retractor posteriorly provide anterior drawer bent Homan retractors medially laterally protect collateral define perimeter tibial bone . The tibial resection carry extramedullary guide position skin top patellar tendon anteriorly . Because positioning , care must take protect patellar tendon proximal tibial resection . The tibia cut one piece use narrow thick saw blade fit capture guide . The narrow blade allow sufficient maneuverability work around patellar tendon sufficient tactile feedback surgeon sense posterior lateral tibial cortex cut . The femoral sizing rotation guide design pinned distal femur thin enough knee subsequently bring 60 degree flexion visualize anterior femur accurate sizing . By bring knee 60 degree flexion place retractor anteriorly surgeon confirm femoral cortex notch . It appropriate clear synovium overlie anterior femoral cortex sure femoral size accurate femur go notch . The femoral finishing guide translate medially laterally femoral rotation confirm reference posterior condyle , Whiteside 's line , transepicondylar axis , clearly define subvastus approach . Before cut anterior femoral cortex surgeon confirm guide place appropriately avoid notching . Trial component assemble knee reduce trial tibial insert check overall limb alignment flexion/ extension gap balance . Patellar preparation surgical approach save end . Cutting patella require exposure , leave patella end risk inadvertent damage cut surface patella minimize . The patella prepared freehand surgeon 's choice cut ream guide . If cut guide use useful remove trial component patellar preparation entire limb shorten , take tension extensor mechanism allow easy access patella preparation . The modular tibial tray cement first follow femur patella . The tibia subluxed forward aid pickle-fork retractor medial lateral margin tibia expose well 90 degree bent Homan retractor . Care take remove excess cement around tibial base plate , particularly posterolaterally , move cement femur . The tibia reposition femur 90 degree flexion femur expose cement place bent Homan retractor medial lateral side collateral ligament insertion femur . A third retractor place VMO overlies anterior femur . Cement apply posterior femoral condyle anterior femoral flange femoral implant cement apply directly bone distal femur anterior chamfer cut . Alternately , entire undersurface femoral implant coat cement impaction . Care take remove excess cement special attention pay distal lateral surface femur cement extrude difficult visualize patella cement . At point real tibial insert place trial insert use surgeon see fit . The patella cement last . Once cement harden , patellar track readily assess . One see centrally track without tilt subluxation contact patellar component medial femoral condyle knee 908 flexion . The tourniquet let small bleeder subvastus space cauterize . The closure begin first reap proximating corner capsule midpole patella . Then , 3 interrupt 0-vicryl suture place along proximal limb arthrotomy . Care take place suture deep VMO muscle instead grasp underlie synovium attach VMO instead muscle . These first 4 suture tie knee 90 degree flexion avoid oversew medial side create iatrogenic patella baja postoperatively . A deep drain place knee joint distal/vertical limb arthrotomy close multiple interrupted 0-vicryl suture place knee 90 degree flexion . The skin close layer . Staples prefer subcuticular suture final closure . There unquestionably tension place skin MIS TKA surgery case standard open surgery , experience , potential wound heal problem magnify skin handle multiple time case run subcuticular closure . Standard Approach : A medial parapatellar approach perform control group ; contemporary modification standard approach total knee arthroplasty . Postoperative Course Hospitalization Patients come hospital day surgery . Hospitalization 2 3 night routine patient , although complication may prolong time . The patient receive one preoperative dose three postoperative dos IV antibiotic 24 hour period . All patient receive appropriate anticoagulation deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis . Postoperative Physical Therapy Both treatment group identical postoperative care via standard postoperative clinical pathway . Structured physical therapy begin day surgery continue hospitalization . Patients encourage sit bedside even surgery . A home therapy program give patient , although formal physical therapy continue outpatient basis . The following general principle follow patient instructed accordingly : - Post-op Day 1 , transfer bed chair assist - Active ROM begin within first 24 hour postoperatively - Weight bearing status progression tolerate - Progress ambulation walker crutches/cane ( ) tolerate - Patients encourage maximize independent ambulation increase distance ambulate daily Discharge Criteria - Patient independent safe aid - Patient able transfer bed stand position - Is able rise chair stand position - Ambulate 100 foot</detailed_description>
