	<brief_title>Comparative Outcomes Management With Electronic Data Technology ( COMET ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STAGE I , Part 1 : We plan extract limited access data set exist research database ( prior research patient ' data APPLES research project patient consent provide limited access data set public domain require grant fund National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute [ NHLBI ] , PI : Kushida ) dummy database prepared test data ( real patient data ) evaluate refine initial iteration informatics infrastructure create via agile evolutionary development process ( see COMET Project Map Section 16 ) . STAGE I , Part 2 : We would like expand functionality informatics infrastructure test ability incorporate research data collect electronic questionnaire , Alliance Sleep Questionnaire ( ASQ ) . Paper ASQ collection approve Stanford Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) pilot collection successfully conclude September 2010 . We enable data collection use electronic version ASQ order use data evaluate refine iteration informatics infrastructure . STAGE I , Part 3 : We expand functionality informatics infrastructure test ability incorporate live ( ongoing ) longitudinal data collect multiple form data source obtain STAGE II study . The addition data allow COMET Steering Committee create use case great diversity data content . The STAGE II data use evaluate refine iteration expand informatics infrastructure . STAGE I , Part 4 : Part 4 design expand collection data beyond individual research study , tap University-wide system ( e.g. , Stride ) link longitudinal data collect research study longitudinal data collect clinical visit . Only de-identified data share global network , local site hold code book translate Global ID Participant ID . All Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) regulation consider . STAGE II : This stage comprise multicenter , randomize , parallel group , comparative effectiveness trial compare positive airway pressure ( PAP ) vs. oral appliance ( OA ) therapy improve hypertension abnormality cardiovascular function overweight/obese patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Data collect STAGE II study incorporate Part 3 STAGE I study . This comparative effectiveness trial conduct 4 clinical center , data collect trial use test electronic network informatics infrastructure . Stage II CET Specific Aims : - To evaluate compare effect positive airway pressure oral appliance therapy 24-hour blood pressure vascular structure function associate obstructive sleep apnea primarily female , overweight/obese hypertensive population . - To evaluate compare effect positive airway pressure oral appliance therapy sleep-disordered breathing , sleepiness , mood , quality life . - To compare cost-effectiveness positive airway pressure oral appliance obstructive sleep apnea treatment . - To explore cardiovascular biomarkers treatment identify genetic polymorphism may predict treatment response . STAGE III : This stage comprise completion data analysis preparation electronic network informatics infrastructure deployment beyond four Clinical Centers interested Clinical Translational Science Awards ( CTSA ) institution . We also explore expand ontology beyond sleep-related ontology medical ontology , use federate database methodology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year . BMI &gt; = 25.0 kg/m2 . A diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea base upon medical history apnea hypopnea index &gt; = 10.0 oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ; ≥4 % ) ≥ 10.0 Diagnostic Polysomnogram . Report history hypertension ( need treatment hypertension ) currently untreated OR take medication treatment hypertension . Stable medication regimen 2 month prior Baseline Testing Visit . Asneeded medication use allergy , cold , minor pain symptom may use discretion Clinical Center physician . Cardiovascular disease , judgment investigator , observed standard clinical practice would lead treat physician make every effort treat patient 's sleep apnea positive airway pressure , rather alternative treatment . Clinically significant acute chronic disease well control could affect ability complete comply study procedure , opinion Clinical Center physician . Respiratory disease require supplemental oxygen medication . Individuals asthma may include discretion Clinical Center physician disease well controlled medication stable 2 month . History ( within 12 month prior enrollment ) , current diagnosis , Axis I Axis II psychiatric disorder ( obstructive sleep apnea ) opinion Clinical Center physician would affect ability complete comply study procedure ( e.g. , schizophrenia psychotic disorder ) . History ( within 3 month prior enrollment ) , current diagnosis narcolepsy , idiopathic hypersomnia , restless legs syndrome , REM behavior disorder , persistent situational insomnia , sleeprelated breathe disorder obstructive sleep apnea . Periodic limb movement arousal index &gt; 10.0 Diagnostic Polysomnogram . Significant daytime sleepiness study entry indicate : Epworth Sleepiness Scale total score &gt; 16 , score 3 ( high chance ) question risk doze `` In car , stop minute traffic '' report fall asleep wheel , motor vehicle accident , nearmiss accident due sleepiness past 24 month , judgment study physician attributable acute sleep loss . Oxygen saturation &lt; 80 % &gt; 10 % sleep time Diagnostic Polysomnogram , intervention positive airway pressure oxygen safety purpose Diagnostic Polysomnogram . Any prior treatment obstructive sleep apnea positive airway pressure oral appliance , surgical treatment obstructive sleep apnea past year . Contraindication treatment either positive airway pressure oral appliance , opinion Clinical Center physician dentist , include significant nasal obstruction , insufficient loose teeth , denture , advance periodontal disease , significant temporomandibular joint pain . Pregnancy . Difficulty understand speak English , inability read understand inform consent study procedure . Significant vision , hearing , motor problem , opinion Clinical Center physician , would affect ability complete study procedure . A work schedule allow nighttime sleep 3 night study visit .
