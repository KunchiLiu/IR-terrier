	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Triheptanoin ( C7 ) Inherited Disorders Energy Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study treat child adult document deficiency mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation include disorder follow enzyme : Carnitine-Acylcarnitine Translocase ( CATR ) , Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I II ( CPT I , CPT II ) , Very-Long Chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) , L-3-Hydroxy-Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase ( LCHAD ) , Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase type 9 ( ACAD9 ) Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein ( TFP ) triheptanoin oil . This study also open patient type glycogen storage disease , pyruvate carboxylase deficiency , type B , Barth Syndrome . Symptoms often persist standard diet include supplementation medium chain triglyceride oil . Preliminary data show triheptanoin reverse many clinical symptom well control standard diet . On study entry , clinical laboratory assessment carry subject usual home diet . A complete history physical exam perform . An echocardiogram must obtain within past year perform day study entry . Following analysis diet negative pregnancy test , subject receive modify diet contain triheptanoin ( 2 grams/kg/24 hour ) , continue previously establish triheptanoin dose ; exceed RDA fat , substitute MCT oil and/or natural fat . This give g-tube orally divide 2 dos . The dose adjust basis safety laboratory monitor specific time point adverse symptom . The remainder diet modify maintain appropriate caloric intake balance . Total calorie appropriate RDA prescribed . Study subject continue triheptanoin-supplemented diet period 12 month able continue indefinite extension phase compassionate use study . Laboratory evaluation take place two , six , twelve month , well every 12 month extension phase . Laboratory test may complete local lab result forward PI review visit Pittsburgh . Patients monitor weight home monthly basis . Interim metabolic evaluation arrange need clinical basis study PI subject 's home metabolic physician . Following initial 12 month protocol , subject place continue schedule maintenance triheptanoin therapy yearly follow visit undeterminable period time . Echocardiograms must complete annual basis send study PI review . Travel Pittsburgh , PA start study annually responsibility subject . Additionally , may study cost insurance cover subject responsible cover . Examples out-of-pocket study cost subject may incur addition travel expense include follow : necessary laboratory test echocardiogram . The study medication provide free charge .</detailed_description>
