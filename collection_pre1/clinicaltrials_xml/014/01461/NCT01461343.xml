	<brief_summary>The purpose study find blood flow change lungs people pulmonary hypertension compare healthy individual without pulmonary hypertension . We would like find difference blood flow subject give drug dilate ( widen ) artery lungs breathe extra oxygen . We compare result subject n't receive drug extra oxygen . We hope know difference help u good understand pulmonary hypertension diagnose earlier .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pulmonary Perfusion Heterogeneity Compliance Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension Using Positron Emission Tomography Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) refers abnormality pulmonary vasculature associate diverse group disorder . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) classify pulmonary hypertension five group , Group I comprise pulmonary arterial hypertension ( formerly refer `` primary pulmonary hypertension '' ) . Although currently part WHO classification , exercise-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( EIPAH ) , define normal pulmonary artery pressure rest elevation pulmonary pressure exercise , increasingly recognize distinct clinical entity . In patient , exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension may represent precursor develop establish elevation pulmonary pressure rest defines PAH . Functional PET image previously utilize quantify perfusion vascular compliance patient pulmonary arterial hypertension . The overall goal study evaluate regional lung perfusion , perfusion heterogeneity , vascular compliance patient exercise-induced rest pulmonary hypertension use functional positron emission tomography image . Ultimately , quantifiable difference healthy subject patient PAH detect 13NN 11CO label PET , functional PET imaging may provide useful image modality early diagnosis pulmonary hypertension monitoring response therapy . In pilot study , recruit 10 adult patient pulmonary hypertension ( 5 PAH 5 EIPAH ) stable PAH-specific therapy ( ) , 5 healthy control .</detailed_description>
