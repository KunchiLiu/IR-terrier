	<brief_title>Effects Wholegrain Diet Body Composition Energy Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesis diet high whole-grains reduces abdominal fat . These finding might clinical public health significance reduce obesity relate co-morbidities like type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Using double-blind cross-over design , energy expenditure , body composition metabolic health assess . Three day inpatient study visit Cleveland Clinic Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) implement metabolic control test . Total daily energy expenditure measure use doubly label water ( DLW ) method . Body fat glucose/protein metabolism assess image isotope technique , respectively . Blood , urine , stool sample also collect cardiometabolic digestive health outcome . After baseline testing , subject begin 8 week dietary intervention , food non-water beverage supply study center . Dietary compliance assess weigh back measurement two time week . To assess time course effect diet differ amount fiber body composition metabolic health , subject provide plasma urine sample 2 , 4 , 8 week initial test . Imaging isotope analysis perform baseline week 8 . All post test conduct week 8 follow similar pre-testing control condition . Subjects undergo 8-10 week washout period instructed return normal diet ( except supplement ) . After washout period , subject start second arm intervention consume alternate diet ( i.e . refine whole grain diet ) . All energy expenditure , body composition metabolic testing procedure repeat alternative arm study describe .</detailed_description>
