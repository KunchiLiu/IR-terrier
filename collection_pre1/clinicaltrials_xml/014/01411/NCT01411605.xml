	<brief_summary>Worldwide , childhood adolescent obesity reach epidemic proportion despite major effort promote weight reduction . Pediatric obesity commonly presage adult obesity associate development weight-related comorbid condition increase morbidity . Regular physical activity important modality obesity management . Despite controversy , poor exercise tolerance frequently report youth obesity cause limit exercise tolerance remain unknown . Several factor accompany obesity may interfere exercise tolerance obese population . Respiratory factor , decrease thoracic compliance , increase airway resistance breathe low pulmonary volume associate obesity may impact exercise intolerance population . Moreover , even people otherwise normal lung , normal ventilatory response exercise become constrained obesity . A thorough understanding mechanism underlie exercise intolerance remain fundamental order favour long term adherence exercise training . This especially true youth population , management overweight obesity must undertake soon possible , due early onset cardiovascular risk factor . The main purpose study determine early-onset cardio-respiratory mortality factor obese adolescent well relation exercise intolerance ( i.e . dyspnea ) compare age gender-paired normal-weight volunteer .</brief_summary>
