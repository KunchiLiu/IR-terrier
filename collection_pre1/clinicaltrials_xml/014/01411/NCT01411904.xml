	<brief_title>A Novel Magnetic Needle Using Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Detection Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability reliably detect Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) leukemia patient allow oncologist predict patient outcome monitor efficacy therapy critical improving care . MRD use identify high risk patient identify conventional high risk feature , presence &lt; 0.1 % MRD show one best predictor 5-year remission , 70 % patient â‰¥ 0.1 % relapsing . In addition provide prediction relapse , MRD show provide sensitive measure early treatment response , independent predictor good outcome . While presence MRD indicative patient outcome , detection presence MRD provide opportunity modify treatment potentially increase survival . Studies currently underway use MRD detection modify chemotherapeutic treatment time stem cell transplant leukemia patient . Development low cost easily accessible MRD detector potential expand number patient MRD test available . Expansion patient population necessary step large scale test MRD detection predictive factor patient outcome potential modifier patient treatment . It expect increased MRD test would lead improved prediction patient outcome increase sensitivity test treatment response . MRD test general patient population could use test treatment response allow oncologist modify treatment regiment lead reduced patient mortality improve medical outcome .</detailed_description>
