	<brief_summary>The study aim assess 1 ) electrical activity diaphragm mechanically ventilate patient wean mechanical ventilation . 2 ) Whether electrical activity diaphragm may predict wean outcome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Activity Diaphragm During Weaning Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimization time liberate patient mechanical ventilation balance risk associate fail extubation relate prolonged mechanical ventilation . Weaning failure associate major complication . Even wean protocol clinical predictor use improve wean outcome , still significant proportion patient fail breath spontaneously significant risk pneumonia , prolong mechanical ventilation increase morbidity mortality rate . Electrical activity diaphragm , mirror respiratory drive available ICU ventilator may help predict accurate way wean outcome . The patient ventilate NAVA titration method ( 1 ) . As soon patient pass successfully daily screen EAdi measure spontaneous breathe trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient older 18 year mechanically ventilate &gt; = 48 h. In resolve stage disease bring mechanical ventilation . Pao2/Fio2 ratio &gt; 150 positive endexpiratory pressure ( PEEP ) &lt; =8 cm H2O . Sedation discontinue minimum 24 hr Analgesia provide solely morphine dosage less equal 0.01 mg/kg/hr . Patient fully alert cooperative . Intact respiratory drive evaluate Glasgow Coma Scale &gt; =10 . The attend physician refuse allow enrolment The patient refuse informed consent Hemodynamic instability despite adequate filling ( i.e . need continuous infusion epinephrine vasopressin , dopamine dobutamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine &gt; 0.1 mcg/kg/min maintain systolic arterial blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ) No collaborative Patient Coagulation platelets disorder neuromuscular disease phrenic nerve damage/diaphragm paralysis contraindication exchange nasogastric tube History heart lung transplantation Presence suspicion central nervous system disorder</criteria>
