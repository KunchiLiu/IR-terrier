	<detailed_description>proportional systemic gabapentin exposure wide dose range . This double-blind , placebo-and active-controlled 3-period crossover study design assess effect GEn 600 mg simulate driving performance . Subjects receive 3 treatment randomize order : GEn 600 mg , placebo placebo/diphenhydramine 50 mg. Each treatment period consist 6 day , subject dose approximately 5 pm dose day . The placebo /diphenhydramine treatment consist placebo Days 1-4 6 50 mg diphenhydramine Day 5 . Placebo administered Day 6 treatment period ensure washout drug prior start next treatment period . Simulated drive performance assess baseline ( prior randomization ) Day 5 evening ( 7-9 pm ) Day 6 between7-9 11am-1pm treatment period .</detailed_description>
