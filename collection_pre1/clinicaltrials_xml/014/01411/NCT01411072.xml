	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy give curative surgery pancreas cancer try improve cure rate . There two choice chemotherapy currently consider equal treatment : gemcitabine 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . This study try determine one two standard chemotherapy well depend whether patient high low human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 ( hENT1 ) . hENT1 protein find vary amount pancreas cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Directed Adjuvant Chemotherapy Resected Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale pilot study base try well deliver adjuvant chemotherapy select treatment patient individualize base hENT1 biomarker . Gemcitabine ( gem ) require human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 ( hENT1 ) enter cell . If pancreatic cancer low hENT1 , gem able enter cell efficiently . 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) require transport cell . Thus , upfront hENT1 test allow determination therapy .</detailed_description>

Adequate hepatic renal function define follow laboratory parameter : AST ALT ≤ 2.5 X upper limit institutional normal , bilirubin ≤ upper limit institutional normal , calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min use CockcroftGault formula , 50 mL/min base formula GFR ≥ 50 mL/min determine . Patients may receive prior curative radiotherapy different malignancy ( unless radiation curative therapy ≥ 25 % bone marrow store ) patient must recover toxic effect treatment . Patients must start protocol ≤ 10 week date curative surgical resection , patient must recover toxic effect surgery . Patients must ability read , understand , sign informed consent must willing comply study treatment followup . Patients receive prior chemotherapy radiation deliver part initial curative therapy pancreas cancer ( i.e . neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy administer alone and/or concurrently deliver radiation and/or surgery ) permit . Metastatic patient permit . Prior treatment different malignancy &gt; 6 cycle traditional alkylating agentbased chemotherapy , &gt; 2 cycle carboplatinbased chemotherapy , concurrent treatment experimental drug anticancer therapy . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract , malabsorption syndrome , short gut syndrome , history bowel obstruction due peritoneal metastasis . Previous concurrent malignancy , exclude curatively treat situ carcinoma cervix nonmelanoma skin cancer , unless least 5 year elapse since last treatment patient consider cured . Any serious medical condition within 6 month prior study entry myocardial infarction , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , unstable angina , active cardiomyopathy , unstable ventricular arrhythmia , cerebrovascular disease , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder , serious infection , active peptic ulcer disease , medical condition . Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency . Pregnant lactating woman ; woman child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day trial registration . Women men child bear potential must use effective contraception ( define treat physician ) must document study CRFs . Any reason investigator considers patient participate study</criteria>
