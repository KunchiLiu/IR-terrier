Although CBT gold standard treatment pediatric OCD , patient benefit availability skilled therapist quite limited . Thus , critical need intervention optimize treatment outcome pediatric OCD . The primary mechanism CBT repeat prolonged exposure fear situation abstain OCD ritual . This treatment base animal model extinction condition fear . Basic research neural circuitry underlie fear extinction lead examination d-cycloserine ( DCS ) , partial agonist NMDA receptor amygdala , agent capable enhance extinction learn . Following successful validation strategy animal , six trial adult human - one study youth OCD - provide support DCS dose facilitate extinction learn occurs exposure-based psychotherapy . However , expert agency responsible regulate drug indication US , include FDA , recognize safety efficacy finding adult routinely extrapolate child . The present study furthers pilot work DCS augment effect CBT child OCD . The investigator conduct double-blind randomize controlled trial , conduct two site , examine relative benefit 10 psychotherapy session session 4-10 augment weight-adjusted dos DCS ( 25/50mg ) compare CBT augment placebo . 150 youth ( age 7-17 ) OCD randomly evenly assign one two treatment condition . The primary outcome change OCD symptom severity assess independent evaluator . The study recruitment sit University South Florida ( USF ) Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School ( MGH ) .
