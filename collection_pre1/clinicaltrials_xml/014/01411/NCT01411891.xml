	<brief_summary>Joint replacement become increasingly common procedure . In 2005 , 534,000 total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) perform United States rate 18.1 per 10,000 individual , demand primary TKA project grow 673 % 2030 . Effective post-operative analgesia important component regard patient satisfaction hospital stay . Regional anesthesia show decrease duration surgery , need transfusion , post-operative nausea vomiting , incidence thromboembolic disease patient undergoing total knee total hip replacement compare general anesthesia . Post-operatively , regional anesthesia show reduce pain score and/or morphine consumption well opioid-related adverse effect . Epidural catheter spinal anesthesia become standard care University Wisconsin-Madison intraoperative management TKA patient . General anesthesia still occasionally used patient would strongly prefer general anesthetic , take anticoagulation medication coagulopathy , previous back surgery , certain neurologic condition multiple sclerosis spina bifida . Comparison study lumbar epidural analgesia femoral nerve catheter ( FNC ) postoperative analgesia follow TKA show significant difference pain score , morphine consumption , post-operative nausea vomiting . However , epidural analgesia associate high incidence hypotension urinary retention . FNC 's placed postoperative pain allow patient ambulate effectively much low extremity motor block . Patients FNC postoperative analgesia also require urinary catheter eliminate common source infection postoperative patient . FNCs also demonstrate improved rehabilitation time decreased hospital stay lead increased insertion rate FNCs postoperative analgesia follow TKA University Wisconsin . Pyarthrosis fairly common complication occur rate 2 % follow primary 5.6 % follow revision TKA . Infection devastate complication follow implantation joint hardware often lead extend hospitalization/rehabilitation stay return trip operate room . The average bill charge type revision TKA procedures $ 49,360 average length stay 5.1 day . Indwelling line know infection risk indwell line femoral region know associate high incidence catheter colonization . At 48 hour , Cuvillon et . al . find 57 % FNCs place without use chlorhexidine impregnate patch positive bacterial colonization . They also describe three case transient bacteremia secondary FNCs 208 catheter analyze . Chlorhexidine impregnate patch also know `` biopatches '' show reduce incidence bacterial colonization infection various indwell line include epidural central venous catheter . Currently standard care exist require use biopatches FNCs . The investigator propose study use biopatch reduce incidence bacterial colonization femoral nerve catheter . The investigator study efficacy biopatch decrease rate bacterial colonization FNCs TKA patient . The FNCs inserted standard fashion remove end therapy . Typically FNC infusion continue morning post-operation day ( POD ) # 1 2 . The process FNC insertion first involve sterile prep drape femoral region . Full sterile technique utilized include gown , glove , mask . Ultrasound guidance commonly utilized identify femoral nerve . Following patient sedation skin infiltration local anesthetic , tuohy needle insert adjacent femoral nerve . A catheter thread needle close proximity femoral nerve . Patients randomize either chlorhexidine impregnate patch chlorhexidine impregnate patch locate catheter exit site . On morning POD 1 2 , FNC infusion discontinue . Typically , Twenty-four forty-eight hour catheter insertion , remove sterile fashion skin surround catheter exit site swab distal catheter tip send culture determine bacterial colonization . In addition , investigator interview patient review clinical data determine sign infection and/or catheter tip colonization rate .</brief_summary>
