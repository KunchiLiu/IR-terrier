	<detailed_description>GSK2190915 high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein ( FLAP ) inhibitor attenuate production leukotrienes , blockage first committed step leukotriene pathway , 5 lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) activation . Leukotrienes potent inflammatory molecule produce mainly mast cell , eosinophil , monocytes/macrophage neutrophil response allergic inflammatory stimulus . As GSK2190915 inhibit production leukotriene B4 cysteinyl leukotrienes strong potential utility treatment asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) The organic anion transport polypeptide ( OATP 's ) form superfamily sodium-independent transport system mediate transmembrane transport wide range amphipathic organic compound . Of 11 human OATP transporter , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 specifically express sinusoidal membrane hepatocytes consider particular importance hepatic drug elimination drug pharmacokinetics . GSK2190915 show inhibitor OATP1B1 OATP1B3 . Several clinically utilise drug identify substrate OATP transporter , include rosuvastatin - member statin group anti-lipidemics . As target patient population GSK2190915 may overlap statin rosuvastatin , important evaluate potential effect GSK2190915 pharmacokinetics statin know undergo hepatic elimination via OATP1B1/1B3 This study evaluate effect repeat oral dose GSK2190915 steady-state pharmacokinetics rosuvastatin . In addition , study evaluate safety tolerability combination co-administered healthy , adult volunteer . Two dose level GSK2190915 investigate ; 30mg 100mg daily 7 day . The rosuvastatin dose select study 10mg allow 4 time increase systemic exposure pharmacokinetic interaction . The study open label , single-sequence study two cohort 2 treatment period . 28 subject receive rosuvastatin 10mg/day 7 day first treatment period , follow 14 subject receive either GSK2190915 30 mg/day GSK2190915 100mg/day combination rosuvastatin 10mg/day next 7 day . Subjects follow 7-14 day last dose . PK sample obtain rosuvastatin GSK2190915 study . Safety evaluate via physical examination , ElectroCardioGrams ( ECG ) vital sign . Approximately 28 healthy subject enrol approximately 24 subject ( 12 two treatment arm ) complete dose critical assessment .</detailed_description>
