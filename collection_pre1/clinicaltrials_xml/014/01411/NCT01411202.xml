	<brief_summary>Patients cancer may experience problem breathe due fluid accumulation around lung call malignant pleural effusion ( MPE ) . This fluid drain draining may stop fluid accumulate . MPE cause shortness breath activity rest leave patient feel though catch breath enough comfortable . Other symptom include pain , cough weight loss . One way stop fluid accumulate create scar tissue lung chest wall room fluid accumulation . This procedure call pleurodesis . Pleurodesis standard care centre across Canada . This procedure do inject drug space lung chest wall catheter , Doxycycline one drug currently use purpose . Traditionally , patient admit pleurodesis , mostly size catheter use inject medication large also potential complication happen large chest tube . At centre , patient MPE manage home small sized catheter know Pleurx catheter . The Pleurx catheter allow patient remain home treatment trained staff come home drain MPE monitor patient . Sometimes , patient experience pleurodesis use Pleurx catheter alone . Pleurodesis doxycycline happen fast Pleurx catheter alone . It experience limit number patient safe perform pleurodesis use Pleurx catheter doxycycline injection outpatient setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Doxycycline Treating Pleural Effusions Related Cancer Outpatient Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural effusion ( MPE ) occur 25 - 50 % malignancy , represent advance disease carry significant morbidity . It estimate 75 % malignant effusion symptomatic time presentation , dyspnea common complaint . Cough , weight loss chest pain may also present symptom . The diagnosis MPE often carry poor prognosis average survival 3-9 month . Thus , management MPE generally palliative , aim alleviate associate symptom , incur minimal discomfort disruption patient activity daily live . Limiting number day spend hospitalized ia also consideration . Currently , common treatment MPE involve tube thoracostomy pleurodesis use sclerosing agent . Use Doxycycline sclerosing agent show safe efficacious minor complication . Traditionally , pleurodesis Doxycycline perform inpatient setting . The Pleurx catheter ( Cardinal Biomedical ) small bore catheter commercially available specifically design long term indwell drainage MPE . In order reduce chance dislodgement minimize infection rate , tunnel skin approximately 5 cm enter pleural space . These indwell catheter provide excellent symptom control also associate spontaneous pleurodesis rate comparable many chemical pleurodesis rate . Pleurx compare inpatient doxycycline pleurodesis via chest tube difference survival , safety efficacy note . However , hospital stay significantly short Pleurx group , 1 day versus 6.5 day . The aim study determine effectiveness outpatient pleurodesis , use doxycycline administer via Pleurx catheter . This randomized clinical trial comparing time pleurodesis patient malignant pleural effusion receive doxycycline + Pleurx catheter versus Pleurx catheter alone .</detailed_description>
