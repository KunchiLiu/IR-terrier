	<detailed_description>There three total visit study . Details visit list . Screening/Assessment Visit : This evaluation include interview , questionnaire , computerized testing , urine drug screen , breath sample carbon monoxide level alcohol physical examination . If accept study , schedule biofeedback image session . Both smoker nonsmoking control go screen process . Biofeedback Session : You ask participate biofeedback session schedule 60 minute . You comfortably seat sensor measure temperature place finger non-dominant hand . You ask make change skin temperature base feedback monitoring system . Your response biofeedback session compare response feedback scanner . Both smoker nonsmoking control go biofeedback session . Imaging Visit : The image visit last approximately 2 hour . You also ask refrain use alcohol street drug 24 hour use marijuana 3 day prior visit . If smoke , ask smoke 2 hour prior scan session .
