	<brief_title>Field Trial Hypotensive Versus Standard Resuscitation Hemorrhagic Shock After Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Overview This multi-center pilot trial design determine feasibility safety hypotensive resuscitation early resuscitation patient traumatic shock compare standard fluid resuscitation . Blunt penetrate trauma patient prehospital systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≤ 90 mmHg eligible . In hypotensive resuscitation group , intravenous line ( IV ) place radial pulse palpate . If radial pulse present SBP great equal 70 , 250 ml bag normal saline hung maintain keep vein open rate . If radial pulse absent , 250 ml normal saline give bolus . This process use small bag fluid repeat radial pulse palpable 2 hour Emergency Department ( ED ) arrival hemorrhage control achieve . The decision utilize SBP versus radial pulse make priori . Patients standard fluid resuscitation group IV place 1000 ml bag normal saline ( NS ) hung . Fluid give rapidly possible continued hospital arrival . If prehospital hospital fluid resuscitation exceed 2 liter , stop SBP exceed 110 mmHg restart necessary maintain goal SBP 110 mmHg . This randomization scheme continue 2 hour hospital arrival hemorrhage control achieve whichever occurs first . The randomization affect indication administration blood product hypothesize less blood product total fluid give experimental group due avoidance pop-the-clot phenomenon , less hemodilution less coagulopathy . Patients experience ground level fall characterize low injury severity score . ( 70 ) Patients suspect ground level fall excluded effort focus enrollment severely injured patient risk trauma relate hemorrhagic shock . Patients severe traumatic brain injury exclude due lack equipoise . In observational study ( 1-5 ) relationship hypotension poor neurologic outcome observe EMS personnel well researcher time believe unethical withhold resuscitation fluid patient traumatic brain injury . Patients suspect spinal cord injury also exclude base evidence indicate risk cardiovascular failure due hemodynamic compromise correlate presence neurogenic hypotension time hospital admission . ( 69 ) All enrol patient retrospectively screen determine evidence severe traumatic brain injury GCS≤8 spinal cord injury time enrollment . Screening information obtain potentially eligible patient meet inclusion criterion . Screening also document whether exclusion criterion meet . The rate screen patient enrol later find meet one exclusion criterion assess determine inclusion exclusion criterion need adjust avoid enrollment patient future study . These patient also assess determine enrollment protocol potentially harm patient . The study two arm , randomize interventional trial compare two resuscitation strategy . Due obvious difference treatment enrol patient , study blind . Nevertheless , treatment bag package container provider able identify whether treatment container house 1000 ml bag 250 ml bag treatment container open . The patient consider randomized time study bag open regardless whether fluid give . Hospitals provide 250 ml bag NS continue treatment patient randomize hypotensive resuscitation arm . The primary outcome study volume prehospital in-hospital fluid administer time injury 2 hour hospital stay hemorrhage control test feasibility 24 hour survival safety hypothesis . Secondary outcome include measure protocol adherence , 24 hour fluid volume , 24 hour blood product requirement , ventilator day , hospital length stay , intensive care unit ( ICU ) length stay , admission base deficit , development renal failure , admission hematocrit admission coagulation parameter . The primary goal pilot study determine describe model result different early fluid volume deliver two group determine differ volume impact mortality . If pilot study show hypotensive resuscitation feasible safe , large trial plan determine efficacy hypotensive fluid resuscitation . This study conduct Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ( ROC ) collaboration 7 regional site United States Canada Data Coordinating Center . This consortium charge task conduct clinical trial patient life threaten trauma cardiac arrest . The following ROC site commit participate trial : Alabama , Dallas , Milwaukee , Ottawa , Pittsburgh , Portland , Vancouver . 2 . Specific Aims Hypotheses Specific Aim 1 : To investigate whether early crystalloid ( normal saline ) resuscitation volume reduce trauma patient hemorrhagic shock receive hypotensive resuscitation versus receive standard early resuscitation ( feasibility ) whether difference 24-hour survival group ( safety ) . Primary Hypotheses : The null hypothesis patient receive hypotensive resuscitation patient receive standard resuscitation volume early crystalloid ( normal saline ) resuscitation administer 24-hour survival 911 call receive dispatch time . Specific Aim 2 : To assess protocol adherence difference morbidity adverse event hypotensive versus standard resuscitation . Secondary Hypotheses : The null hypothesis protocol adherence low hypotensive resuscitation versus standard resuscitation result amount total fluid volume total blood product requirement within 24 hour 911 call receive dispatch , base deficit , hematocrit coagulation parameter admission ED , number day ventilator , duration hospital stay , ICU length stay , incidence renal failure .</detailed_description>
