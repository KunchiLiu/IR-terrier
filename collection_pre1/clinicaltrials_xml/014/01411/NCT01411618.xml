	<brief_summary>The daily removal supragingival dental plaque major factor prevention caries , gingivitis periodontitis . Proper control bacterial plaque obtain mechanical removal biofilm proper use toothbrush floss . However , study show mean time brush tooth surface le required obtain proper clean 1 2-10 % patient use dental floss regularly effectively 2 . In addition , demonstrate even education motivation patient proper use toothbrush floss , compliance reduce time 3 . The result persistence plaque area , particularly interproximal surface teeth . Many study demonstrate effectiveness usefulness antiseptic mouthwash contain active ingredient chlorhexidine ( CHX ) essential oil ( EO ) prevent control formation plaque gingivitis , use addition mechanical procedure 4-7 . Chlorhexidine still gold standard antimicrobial action high substantiveness , side effect , pigmentation , taste alteration formation supragingival calculus limit continue use 8 . Essential oil ( EO ) mouthwash use year adjunct brush address oral hygiene . Their effectiveness control plaque gingivitis well documented literature 9-14 . They kill microorganism destroy cell wall inhibit enzymatic activity 15,16 . Furthermore , phenolic compound like EOs know interfere inflammation process 17,18 . The antibacterial action particularly effective ability mouthwash EOs penetrate biofilm 19-21 . The traditional EO mouthwash contain ethanol , chemical use dissolve numerous substance mouthwash , include CHX . The concentration ethanol present mouthwash EOs 20 % , sufficient dissolve EOs enough carry direct antibacterial effect 22,23 . Many aspect use alcohol mouthwash , effect surface composite restoration 24 possible role formation oropharyngeal cancer discuss 25,26 . Although direct correlation cause effect occurrence oropharyngeal cancer use mouthwash alcohol 27 , demonstrate far , consider desirable eliminate ethanol use daily mouthwash , bring search new formulation . Recently , EOs contain mouthwash without alcohol introduce European market ( Daycare , Curaden , Kriens , Suisse ) . To knowledge , date publish data effectiveness antimicrobial product . The rinse mouthwash cause few side effect , contrast , may less effective . The aim study evaluate inhibitory property new alcohol free EO contain mouthwash respect traditional mouthwash contain 21.3 % ethanol , standard 3-days plaque regrowth model .</brief_summary>
