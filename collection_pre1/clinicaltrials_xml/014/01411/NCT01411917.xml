	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane Blocks Ileostomy Takedown : A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject Enrollment The chart patient schedule ileostomy takedown surgery screen eligibility day surgery investigator study . On day surgery , patient see pre-operative hold area member anesthesia team acute pain team . They screen eligibility anesthesia surgery . Once clear operating room see resident , fellow , attend acute pain service , investigator study , confirm eligibility study . A peripheral intravenous line also place standard operating room . If determine meet eligibility criterion discussion clinical trial coordinator investigator determine patient would like participate study . If would like proceed subject study consent . The consent process take place semi-enclosed space use preoperative hold consent surgical procedure anesthesia . Study investigator coordinator conduct consent process . Conduct Study Study Procedure Overview The nurse check patient preoperative hold area collect usual preoperative information . Once patient consent part study bring block room . Standard monitor place time- procedure perform , standard procedure take place block room . Side procedure verify . At time subject randomize receive TAP block placebo random computer generate assignment seal envelope . The study solution prepare regional anesthesiologist perform procedure . The subject receive sedation midazolam verse titrated effect standard block placement . The subject ' abdomen side ipsilateral ileostomy sterilely prepared . The ultrasound sterile dressing place probe standard 21 gauge 22 gauge b-bevel , 10 cm block needle flush study solution . A syringe 1 % lidocaine also prepare anesthetize skin prior insertion block needle . The ultrasound place abdomen . Once good view 3 muscle layer interest visualize ( internal oblique , external oblique transverses abdominis ) probe hold still 1 % lidocaine use numb skin . The block needle place `` line '' probe entirety needle may visualize procedure . Treatment Study Procedure The TAP block place use standardize ultrasound guide approach . Subjects assign study group injection 30ml 0.375 % bupivacaine , local anesthetic 3mcg/ml epinephrine place plane internal oblique transversus abdominis . The needle aspirate every 5 ml monitor possible intravascular injection . During injection pulse EKG monitor well screen intravascular injection . Once solution inject needle remove skin area clean dry cloth . Control Study Procedure The placebo block ultrasound guide subcutaneous injection plane tissue right external oblique . The standard ultrasound guide approach use . The solution inject 30 ml sterile preservative free saline . The reason choose injection subcutaneously minimize patient risk injection . Subcutaneous injection far peritoneal cavity . By use normal saline injection eliminate small risk local anesthetic toxicity . Note every subject , regardless group assignment , receive aggressive pain control regimen ( IV PCA-patient control analgesia , toradol , schedule tylenol , local wound infiltration ) adequate analgesia . Toradol routinely use added purpose aggressive pain control subject study . Follow Subjects receive general anesthetic surgical procedure . An appropriate dose propofol use induction anesthesia . Fentanyl administer intra-operative analgesia deem necessary anesthesia team care patient operating room . No long acting opioids , ketamine , local anesthetic infusion administer case . Dexamethasone ( 4 mg IV ) administer induction zofran ( 4 mg IV ) administer prior emergence . Local infiltration wind local anesthetic perform subject , standard surgery . The local anesthetic use per surgeon preference . After Surgery - All subject start hydromorphone patient control analgesia ( PCA ) well toradol ( 15 mg IV q 6 hour 24 hour ) . - A member study protocol anesthesia acute pain service evaluate subject PACU . - They assess Numeric Rating pain Scores ( NRS ) 0-10 0 represent pain 10 represent bad pain imaginable , vital sign , presence side effect include nausea , vomit and/or pruritis . This pain assessment standard care would happen regardless study participation . Day 2 ( post operative day 1 ( POD1 ) ) - Study personnel evaluate subject morning surgery . They assess current pain score , duration block ( know ) , presence side effect include nausea , vomit and/or pruritis . The assessment pain score assessment do day surgery , 24-hour post-surgery timepoint do study coordinator research purpose . - Medical record review order collect information subject 's pain overnight medication administration . We also collect age , sex , height , weight , opioid usage ( weekly , monthly , rarely ) , baseline pain score , ASA physical status medical record . Data Recording After block perform procedure note enter medical record subject . The procedure note document subject enrol study may receive TAP block 30 ml 0.375 % bupivacaine epinephrine . It say also may receive subcutaneous injection normal saline . The note document complication encounter block placement subject ' disposition time completion block . A record subject receive type block , solution , keep document held lock cabinet block room ( within operating room ) . This reference report anesthesia team care patient issue arise patient care would necessitate unblinding . Otherwise , post-operative day 1 ( POD1 ) , procedure note document actual procedure enter subject 's medical chart . This do study data collect .</detailed_description>
