	<brief_title>Premanifest Huntington 's Disease : Creatine Safety &amp; Tolerability Extension Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive evidence exist neurodegeneration begin many year HD diagnose clinically . Therefore , desirable begin neuroprotective therapy premanifest period aim delay onset , well slow functional decline . Cellular energy depletion present early HD ameliorate creatine , help regenerate cellular ATP . Preclinical evidence creatine 's potential neuroprotective effect animal model HD well-documented . Before clinical efficacy creatine test premanifest HD , long-term safety tolerability must assess individual ability favorably modify biomarkers HD also confirm . This extension trial continue follow eligible individual complete PreCREST study open-label creatine ( 30 gram daily ) long term safety tolerability . Additional biological imaging biomarkers disease progression potential response treatment also assess .</detailed_description>
