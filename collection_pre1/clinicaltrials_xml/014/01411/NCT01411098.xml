	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose radiation therapy give together cisplatin etoposide treat patient non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Drugs , cisplatin , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving radiation therapy together cisplatin etoposide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) escalate dos radiotherapy ( RT ) administer concomitantly fix dose cisplatin etoposide within overall treatment time . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study radiation therapy . Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 8 week . Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 28 , 36 etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-5 28-32 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week 6 month .</detailed_description>
