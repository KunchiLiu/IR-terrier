	<brief_summary>Note : In June 2013 , study design change randomize control study risperidone + despiramine vs. risperidone vs. placebo open label pre-post study risperidone ( risperidone-like drug ) + desipramine . The aim study revise read : 1 . To determine whether participant treat risperidone combination desiprmaine less alcohol use ( few drinking day ; few heavy drinking day ) final 8 week medication compare pre-baseline . The primary hypothesis compare pre-baseline , participant demonstrate few day drinking ( per week ) , well few day heavy drinking ( per week ) final eight week take risperidone desipramine , record Timeline Follow-Back assessment 2 . To explore change symptom ( schizophrenia depression ) final eight week treatment risperidone + desipramine compare period baseline 3 . To assess side effect burden associate combination two medication participant . The original aim study : The purpose study determine whether participant treat risperidone combination desipramine less alcohol use ( few drinking day ; few heavy drinking day ) participant treat RISP placebo . The primary hypothesis compare treatment risperidone , participant randomize combination risperidone plus desipramine few day drinking , well few day heavy drinking . The study also compare effect risperidone compare risperidone plus desipramine participant ' symptom side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risperidone Desipramine Alcohol Use Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol use disorder least three time common schizophrenia general population , worsen course schizophrenia . Typical antipsychotic agent limited value control alcohol use `` dual diagnosis '' patient . Data group others suggest atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine limit alcohol cannabis use `` dual diagnosis '' patient schizophrenia much effectively antipsychotic assess , however , side effect produce clozapine severely limit use . The investigator hypothesize clozapine lessen alcohol/substance use dual diagnosis patient part mechanism action include release dopamine ( DA ) prefrontal cortex help normalize dysfunctional brain reward circuit may underlie co- occur alcohol/substance use patient schizophrenia . Our data suggest effect clozapine duplicate rodent medication clozapine-like activity ( DA D2 antagonism , potent norepinephrine ( NE ) α2 receptor antagonism NE reuptake inhibition ) combine together . The investigator demonstrate RISP ( medication DA D2 receptor antagonist , potent NE α2 receptor antagonist ) , combination specific NE reuptake inhibitor desipramine , significantly decrease alcohol consumption alcohol drinking rodent . This translational study pilot `` proof concept '' 14-week double-blind investigation 40 participant co-occurring diagnosis schizophrenia alcohol use disorder . Patients treat risperidone ( risperidone-like agent , include risperidone long-acting , paliperidone paliperidone palmitate ) time consent switch oral risperidone first two week study . At Week 3 , participant begin treatment risperidone risperidone plus desipramine follow 12 week . The primary outcome measure day drinking ( per week ) , well day heavy drinking ( per week ) . The investigator anticipate data study support large trial risperidone + desipramine patient schizophrenia alcohol use disorder .</detailed_description>
