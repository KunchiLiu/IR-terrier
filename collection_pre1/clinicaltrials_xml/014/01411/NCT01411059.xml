	<detailed_description>Yoga currently recommend restore preserve strength , flexibility , balance , &amp; physical capacity old adult ; however , clinical trial experience suggest without proper evidenced-based prescription , Yoga participation ineffective even injurious senior . To address lack evidence-based knowledge , propose IDS : 1 ) quantify physical demand 32-wk Yoga program design independent ambulatory senior ; 2 ) characterize relation demand participant physical characteristic ; 3 ) examine adherence , efficacy , &amp; safety program ; 4 ) characterize relation among reported adverse event , baseline participant characteristic , Yoga physical demand .</detailed_description>
