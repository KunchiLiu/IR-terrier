	<brief_summary>Human milk commonly consider 20 calorie per ounce ( kcal/oz ) . However , study show 65 % human milk may less expected 20 kcal/oz greatly affect infant 's growth . The investigator ability measure caloric density human milk add human milk cream human milk ( mother 's donor human milk ) less 20 kcal/oz bring amount .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Milk Cream Caloric Supplement Pre-Term Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once fortification ( either mother 's donor milk ) initiate tolerance establish ( base clinical observation ) , infant randomize one two group : receive human milk cream . - Human Milk Cream Group : Human milk ( either mother 's donor ) test ( per container milk ) . If caloric level fall 20 kcal/oz , appropriate amount human milk cream add milk bring content close possible 20 kcal/oz . - Control Group ( human milk cream ) : Milk ( either mother 's donor ) human milk fortifier provide usual ( milk analyze study purpose ) . This nutritional algorithm continue infant reach 36 week correct gestational age/weaned fortifier ( whichever come first ) otherwise remove study ( due transfer non-study institution , removal study death ) . Data collect time study entry infant reach 36 week correct gestational age wean fortifier ( whichever come first ) otherwise remove study . Primary measure efficacy : The primary measure efficacy study rate change weight initiation enteral feed 36 week correct gestational age wean fortifier , whichever come first . Based intent-to-treat ( ITT ) paradigm , study subject fail complete study period reason , rate determine period time study . In order provide valid comparison study subject , rate weight gain report g/kg/day . In per-protocol analysis , subject drop calculation respect primary endpoint . Primary measure safety : For evaluation safety , untoward effect deem related nutritional regimen identify record . Key outcomes regard include feed intolerance , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) sepsis . Because population high associate morbidity , episodes apnea , use oxygen ventilator evaluate safety perspective . Baseline measure : ( study entry , i.e . initiation enteral feeding ) At study entry , follow variable record : birth weight , gestational age , gender , Apgar score 5 minute , use mechanical ventilation study entry , use prenatal postnatal steroid , age day enteral feeding initiate . In addition presence follow clinical condition either time study entry occur course study note : transient tachypnea newborn ( TTN ) , intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) grade , patent ductus arteriosis ( PDA ) . Other growth measure : Head circumference increment study period length increment study period determine ( record cm/week ) . Length head circumference record weekly basis study period . The use medication influence growth development record . These include postnatal steroid , e.g . hydrocortisone dexamethasone , caffeine methylxanthine preparation . Feeding protocol : The daily amount enteral nutrition record unit mL . This quantity subdivide various type nutrition use , i.e . mother 's milk , donor milk , human milk cream , fortifiers , nutritional support . In event feeding intolerance discontinuation enteral feeding baby return total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) , assume cause identify . The total number day TPN record study period well range date infant TPN . Infectious complication : Although focus study , occurrence sepsis , NEC relate infectious outcome record . Demographics : Basic demographic medical information subject collect record . These variable include : gestational age , birth weight ( include whether infant AGA SGA base standard criterion ) , gender , racial group . Medications : Information dose follow drug record : Lasix , caffeine , diuril , insulin , dopamine . Parenteral Nutrition : Components rate parenteral nutrition record study day evaluate nutritional intake growth . Labs : Nutritionally-relevant lab obtain clinical purpose record : Na , K , Cl , CO2 , BUN , Creatinine , glucose , Ca , Phos , Mg , triglyceride .</detailed_description>
