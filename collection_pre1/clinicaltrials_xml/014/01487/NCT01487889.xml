	<brief_summary>Primary objective study examine effect 2 different approach dietary strategy optimise fatty acid composition complementary food infant 's fatty acid status consequence cognitive visual development . Subjects randomly assign one three group : - Rapeseed oil ( high n-3 PUFA small n-6 : n-3 ratio support endogenous n- 3 LC-PUFA metabolism ) - Fatty fish ( preformed n-3 LC-PUFA , especially DHA ) - Corn oil ( control group , high n-6 PUFA , common complementary food ) . The intervention start begin complementary feeding generally recommend 4 6 month age end age 10 month . For period time subject group receive commercial vegetable-potato-meat-meals part complementary food differs fatty acid composition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A well balance supply polyunsaturated fatty acid , particular omega-3 long chain docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , early childhood essential child 's cognitive visual development . DHA either supply preform diet ( e.g . via fatty fish ) synthesise conversion essential precursor alpha-linolenic acid ( e.g . via rapeseed oil ) . The study examines effect two different approach optimise infants´ fatty acid status . The study sample consist healthy newborn mother ( 3 x 57 infant accord priori power calculation ) enrol delivery hospital region Dortmund , Germany . In total , individual study program cover first 10 month infant 's life . Biomarkers fatty acid status mother collect 8 week pp estimation pre- perinatal fatty acid supply . Additionally , information maternal diet pregnancy delivery assess . The intervention cover period complementary feeding ( 4 6 month age 10 month age ) . In group specific study food give 5 7 time week , whereas 2 fish meal fatty fish group . At age 4 10 month blood sample collect infant examine effect blood fatty acid status . Parameters visual cognitive development also assess age 4 10 month use VEP examination Bayley scale . Infants´ dietary intake assess end 2 month 10 month age use continuous weigh dietary record .</detailed_description>
