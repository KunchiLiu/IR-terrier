	<detailed_description>Background : VA patient serious mental illness ( SMI- e.g. , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder ) die average 13-18 year earlier compare general U.S. population , mostly cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Increased risk CVD relate risk factor person SMI attribute patient , provider , system-level barrier include unhealthy behavior exacerbate mental health-related symptom barrier access continuity care physical mental health service . Objectives : The primary aim randomize controlled effectiveness trial ( RCT ) determine whether VA patient SMI receive Life Goals Collaborative Care ( LGCC ) , program combine customize behavioral change strategy chronic care management SMI experience , within 12 month : ) improve medical outcome ( e.g. , reduce CVD risk factor , improved physical health-related quality life ) , b ) improve mental health outcome , include reduce psychiatric symptom improve mental health-related quality life c ) improve health behavior , compare VA patient SMI receive enhance treatment usual ( i.e. , dissemination health behavior change material addition standard VA medical psychiatric care ) . Secondary aim inform implementation LGCC ass utilization cost difference LGCC versus treatment usual , determine patient factor associate LGCC treatment response , identify organizational factor associate LGCC implementation . Methods : LGCC groundbreaking psychosocial behavior change intervention base Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) consist 1 ) 10 self-management session cover personal goal-setting mental health symptom management reinforce healthy lifestyle ; 2 ) medical care management include identification patient medical risk factor , monitor patient symptom medical need via registry time ; 3 ) support provider guideline community linkages . The investigator enroll individual diagnose SMI CVD risk factor receive care within VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System mental health clinic , randomize receive LGCC enhance treatment usual . Key outcomes include change CVD risk factor ( e.g. , blood pressure , BMI ) , psychiatric symptom , health-related quality life , health behavior ( e.g. , physical activity ) , inpatient outpatient use assess 6 12 month .
