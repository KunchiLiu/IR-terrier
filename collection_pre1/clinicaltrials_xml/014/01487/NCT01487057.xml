	<brief_summary>The continuous increase incidence thyroid cancer last year take neoplasia among first 4 frequent cancer cancer registry Institute Oncology `` Prof.Ion Chiricuţă '' Cluj-Napoca ( IOCN ) , total number 470 new case per year , add 3700 case already evidence Institute . The radical treatment brings long term compensate chronic drug induces mYxoedema 's important side effect . Among one find dislipidemia change high sensitive C reactive protein ( hsCRP ) serological value . In last year , many epidemiological study confirm fact patient high serological value hsCRP present high risk coronary disease heart attack . Prospective study develop european country USA provide result related predictive value hsCRP determination cardiovascular risk . Thus , hsCRP indirect risk factor coronary disease . The risk cardiovascular disease 2 7 time high people high level hsCRP compare one low level ; increase hsCRP serological value determine several year clinical debut coronary disease . The screen population group high risk introduce use prevention cardiac pathology change approach monitoring patient thyroid cancer . A selection protocol elaborate patient withdraw hormone treatment use recombinant thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) personalise monitoring algorithm , shorten hormone treatment withdrawal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although consider rare type cancer incidence 6 case 100 000 person , thyroid carcinoma frequent endocrine tumor . The incidence malignant disease exponentially increase last decade , many specially center world focus good strategy diagnosis , treatment monitoring . By apply suitable multimodal treatment , prognosis disease excellent , offer patient survival rate 90 % 10 year . During monitor disease , patient periodically suppose withdraw hormone treatment ; hormone imbalance , important change metabolism , especially lipid one . This reason preoccupy increase quality life patient addict chronic thyroid hormone therapy . The aim study demonstrate way lipid profile influence quantify cardiovascular risk patient radically treat thyroid cancer , total thyroidectomy , metabolic irradiation undergo chronic thyroid hormone treatment . Nowadays , Romania one country patient suppose kept iatrogenous myxoedema , alternative recombinant thyroid stimulate hormone . For patient mention diagnosis , lipid profile determine consist following : total serologic cholesterol , cholesterol fraction , triglyceride C reactive protein highly sensitive ( hsCRP ) . A score cardiovascular accident risk elaborate . The attempt classify cardiovascular risk group patient present study , would facilitate selection patient access therapy modern monitoring strategy .</detailed_description>
