	<brief_title>Prevaccination Study Cervical Human Papillomavirus Types Yangtze River Delta Area , China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence cervical cancer estimate 500,000 case per year 50 % case fatality rate . Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) infection , common sexually transmitted viral infection , contribute main causative factor development invasive cervical cancer ( ICC ) precursor ( cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , CIN ) . Thus , prophylactic HPV vaccine hold great promise reduce global burden cervical cancer , especially area limit screen . Currently , two prophylactic vaccine , quadrivalent ( Gardasil® , Merck &amp; Co. Inc ) bivalent ( Cervarix™ , GlaxoSmithKline ) vaccine , employ prevention genital HPV infection 100 country , show high efficacy prevention target HPV related CIN2+ . Merck also conduct Phase III trial vaccine protect nine type . As prophylactic efficacy type-restricted different type HPV cover currently available vaccine , determine type-specific HPV distribution association ICC precursor would provide essential information assessment HPV vaccination program impact . What , possible decrease prevalence target type vaccine could affect distribution type , baseline information also important monitoring possible change type-specific HPV distribution vaccination introduce . Previous meta-analyses show ICC , HPV 16 common , follow HPV 18 , HPV 16/18 prevalence 52 % among high-grade cervical lesion . However , prevalence HPV infection varies considerably across world , data limit less-developed country , let alone multi-center study . Knowledge detail pattern HPV type-specific distribution region essential public health policy decision . This also form basis determine type include future generation HPV vaccine target specific region . A tailed HPV vaccine accord regional prevalence would best serve population primary prevention ICC . On side , study focus ICC high-grade cervical lesion , association HPV type progression CIN1 rarely study . CIN1 insensitive histopathological sign HPV infection , spontaneously regress normal host immune system . However , genotype describe persistent associate progression low-grade lesion high-grade lesion , even ICC . Geographical data type-specific prevalence HPV CIN1 appropriately design prospective study would helpful identify type preferentially associate progression malignancy accurately predict future impact vaccination specific region . Recently , randomize , double-blind trial test safety efficacy quadrivalent vaccine ( Gardasil® , Merck &amp; Co. Inc ) Chinese woman ( V501-041-00 ) conduct propose finish three year . The bivalent vaccine ( Cervarix™ , GlaxoSmithKline ) also apply phase III double-blind , randomize controlled trial Chinese woman . These prophylactic vaccine might license commercially available China trial finish . However , free vaccination support government appear unlikely present accord current economic status China . Thus , individual least presently need pay cost vaccine . Yangtze River Delta Area , include Shanghai city , Zhejiang Province Jiangsu Province , economically developed region China . According medium report , total GDP Yangtze River Delta area approximate 1.064 trillion U.S. dollar 2010 , per caput GDP exceed 4,000 U.S. dollar since 2005 . As people high health awareness need , may become large vaccinated population expense China . To best knowledge , multi-center study HPV type-specific distribution association ICC precursor available Yangtze River Delta Area , China , except mono-center study Zhejiang Province , highlight need timely study region large scale vaccination program carry .</detailed_description>
