	<brief_summary>Preclinical data lung cancer cell line show EGFR mutation potentially positive predictor sensitivity BKM120 . Furthermore , erlotinib-resistant model H1975 ( LR858 T790M mutation ) treat BKM120 , significant tumor control observe ( Novartis internal data ) . Therefore , combine BKM120 erlotinib could potentially down-modulate PI3K-Akt activity result synergistic effect cell growth inhibition enhance response erlotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Erlotinib BKM120 Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Sensitive Erlotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentered , open-label , non-randomized Phase II study BKM120 erlotinib patient advanced NSCLC previously sensitive erlotinib . After six patient enrol complete one treatment cycle safety analysis adverse event ( AEs ) conduct assure unexpected prohibitive toxicity combination . The plan study enrollment continue 37 patient . Duration patient 's participation study vary . Treatment continue long patient benefitting treatment , evidence disease progression , meet criterion discontinuation withdrawal .</detailed_description>
