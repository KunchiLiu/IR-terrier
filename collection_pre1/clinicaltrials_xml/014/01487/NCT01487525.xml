	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether low intensity resistance training concurrent application peripheral blood flow restriction device exercise limb elicit increase quadriceps strength , functional gain , ability complete knee-related activity daily live , mobility , quality life individual risk develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . It know high quadriceps strength protective develop symptomatic knee OA.1 However , people risk knee OA frequently tolerate high intensity resistance training generally believe necessary increase muscle strength . Partial blood flow restriction ( PBFR ) exercise muscle report result strength gain , require low level joint loading.2 This method may better tolerate , enable efficacious exercise old adult may tolerate high knee joint load . To asses efficacy 4 week low-intensity resistance training program concurrent application PBFR exercise limb improve quadriceps strength size , leg muscle power , mobility individual risk develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis , test following hypothesis . In comparison low-intensity resistance training without use PBFR , four-week low-intensity resistance-training program PBFR : Primary Hypothesis : Increase ( ) double leg-press 1RM strength ( b ) isokinetic knee extensor strength Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Increase quadriceps muscle volume assess MRI 2 . Increase low limb muscle power ( ) double leg-press 40 % 1RM ( b ) time stair climb 3 . Not adversely effect knee pain quality life assess Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over 9.3 million adult age 60 afflict symptomatic knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) characterize radiographic finding consistent knee pain stiffness . Furthermore , research indicate reduced strength risk factor incident symptomatic knee OA progressive knee OA women.1 , 3 In light finding , need increase quadriceps strength attenuate worsening disease . Studies practice long indicate high intensity resistance training efficient mean elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy strength gains.2 , 4 The American College Sports Medicine well National Strength Conditioning Association indicate resistance training intensity great 65 % one-repetition maximum ( 1 RM ) minimum intensity need achieve desire muscle hypertrophy strength gains.2 , 4 This problematic suffering symptomatic knee OA . Loading already painful joint 65 % ( 1 RM ) would poorly tolerate possibly injurious individual already suffer knee pain stiffness activity daily live . With inability perform exercise prescribe elicit necessary strength gain , knee OA sufferer find unable alleviate debilitate pain result significant decrease quality life . Fortunately , method training , call partial blood flow restriction ( PBFR ) , may offer old adult particularly knee OA , ability develop strength gain necessary attenuate disease progression without require deleterious joint loading . There mount evidence training modality serve stimulator muscle growth even perform relatively low intensity . PBFR develop Japan . Its basic principle involve restriction blood flow exercise muscle purpose increase muscle mass . However , participant able elicit similar strength gain perform exercise , example , 30 % 1RM attained conventional high intensity resistance training . Current PBFR training method result 40 year research development.5 Recent study demonstrate efficacy mechanism effect PBFR training elicit significant isometric isokinetic strength gain well increase ability adult perform functional tasks.6 Exercising 30 % 1RM , PBFR training may benefit old adult suffer knee OA enable development strength necessary protect disease worsen avoid need load joint deleterious level . This study follow-up study IRB # 201101711 complete early year . That study demonstrate tolerance safety protocol . However , increase strength small magnitude hop elicit . The protocol follow-up study similar prior study . We make change effort maintain tolerability safety , hopefully elicit great clinical benefit . Specifically , reduce study duration 9 4 week select efficient exercise protocol reduce subject burden also halve length time PBFR cuff wear exercise session . The prior study gentle strengthen quadriceps muscle , increase resistance 15 % maximum 30 % maximum . This still low intensity compare usual weight lift would &gt; 65 % . We believe change increase benefit participant reduce time burden . Literature cite 1 . Segal NA , Torner JC , Felson D , Niu J , Sharma L , Lewis CE et al .
