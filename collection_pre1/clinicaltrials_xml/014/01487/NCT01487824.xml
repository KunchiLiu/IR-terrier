	<brief_title>What Impact Early Life Exposures Cardiovascular System Young Adulthood ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While incidence cardiovascular disease reduce dramatically , coincide favourable change risk factor , cardiovascular disease remain single large cause mortality premature mortality United Kingdom . Identification novel biological pathway underlie disease susceptibility raise potential new early primary prevention strategy complement classical management . There particular interest role early environment 'programming ' risk cardiovascular disease later life grow evidence various early life exposure impact cardiovascular health long term . We thus design Early Vascular Study investigate long-term impact early life exposure , particular focus impact preterm birth , presence absence pregnancy-induced hypertension mother , cardiovascular system young adulthood . This study also allow investigation long term impact perinatal intervention use cohort . Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measure cardiovascular structure function allow precise quantification cardiovascular phenotype . This combined blood sample collection study change molecular metabolic marker pathway .</detailed_description>
