	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Dual-plasmid Hepatitis B Virus DNA Vaccine Chronic Hepatitis B Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affect approximately 350 million people worldwide , lead wide spectrum clinical manifestation range asymptomatic carrier state self-limited acute infection fulminant hepatitis chronic hepatitis progression cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma pose serious public health problem endemic county like China . Current available therapeutic remedy interferon nucleotide/nucleoside analogues far satisfactory , therapeutic efficacy limit high economic cost less tolerable adverse effect lack viral eradicative effect long term control virus patient . Viral persistence associate defect development HBV-specific cellular immunity . Strategies boost broaden weak virus-specific T-cell response patient chronic hepatitis B propose mean cure persistent infection . HBV envelope- nucleocapsid-based vaccine , new formulation recombinant vaccine DNA-based vaccine currently assess clinical trial , among DNA vaccine represent promising immunotherapeutic approach induce T-cell mediated antigen specific immunity , owe de novo intracellular antigenic protein expression synthesis . In clinical trial , although HBV DNA vaccination develop protective antibody responses antigen-specific CD8 T cell healthy hepatitis-naive human volunteer , detectable HBV-specific IFN-γ secreting T cell decrease serum HBV DNA level chronic HBV carrier vaccinate HBV PreS2/S DNA vaccine limit . One resolution main obstacle new technique development enhance transfection efficiency plasmid host cell ; improve immunogenicity DNA vaccine drive naïve T cell response towards Th1 profile . To tackle first problem low transfection rate DNA vaccine , investigator apply vivo electroporation ( EP ) potency enhancement HBV DNA vaccine , dramatically improve host cell transfection plasmid enable DNA vaccine investigator prepare elicit humoral cellular immune response large body weight animal like rabbit nonhuman primate . In order achieve second goal immunogenicity improvement HBV DNA vaccine therapeutic usage , investigator design construct Th1 type cytokine ( interleukin-2 interferon-γ ) fusion protein expression gene plasmid ( pFP ) , attempt direct Th1 bias favor cellular immunity augment use combination HBV DNA vaccine . Both tactic form dual-plasmids DNA vaccination mediate EP investigate safe efficient improve transfection enhance immunogenicity DNA vaccine host animal model phase I , II trials healthy volunteer CHB patient . In order study immunotherapeutic effect EP-mediated dual-plasmids HBV DNA vaccine , investigator plan conduct clinical trial , approve Chinese State Food Drug Administration ( license number : 2006L03542 ) write informed consent patient . The trial double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled one CHB patient baseline ALT 2 time ULN , antiviral treatment indicate simultaneous lamivudine ( LAM ) chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
