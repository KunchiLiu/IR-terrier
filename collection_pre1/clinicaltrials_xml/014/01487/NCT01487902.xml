	<brief_title>The Role Androgen Deprivation Treatment ( ADT ) Docetaxe-Prednisolone Chemotherapy Castrate-Resistant Prostatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) mainstay treatment metastatic prostate carcinoma . Despite initial favorable response , predictable irreversible resistance ADT occur vast majority patient , define Castrate-Resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Recently , TAX327 study reveal docetaxel plus prednisolone could improve QOL PSA response also prolong survival CRPC . It reason discontinuation ADT nonorchiectomized patient may detrimental effect patient CRPC discontinuation ADT result renew release testosterone possible stimulation remain androgen-sensitive element . When exogenous testosterone therapy administer patient symptomatic CRPC , adverse response induce . However , low concentration endogenous androgen capable stimulating tumor growth unknown . Data animal model androgen-dependent tumor show androgen-independent status usually follow androgen-insensitivity , support need ADT CRPC . Contradictory , Dunning rat prostate cancer model cell line , androgen-insensitive vitro grow slowly castrate rat , grow rapidly host intact testis . In retrospective observational study CRPC treat anthracycline , platinum , ketoconazole , Taylor , et al . show modest , statistically significant , survival advantage ADT continue . But , Hussain et al . team report obvious advantage continue ADT response cytotoxic chemotherapy survival patient CRPC . In addition , prospective trial conduct Shamash , et al . show hormonal sensitivity reintroduce stop ADT chemotherapy CRPC . Among 43 patient restart androgen blockade completion chemotherapy without ADT , 37 % patient PSA response associate survival advantage . Despite limited retrospective information available impact continue ADT disease outcome CRPC treat cytotoxic chemotherapy , especially docetaxel contain regimen , ADT frequently advocate use continuously . Considering little information benefit continue ADT , cost side effect ADT , prospective comparative study eagerly need .</detailed_description>
