	<brief_title>Alkaline Water Reducing Skin Toxicity Women With Breast Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . The goal two-phase study ass rate grade 2 high radiation-related skin toxicity adult patient breast malignancy administration alkaline ( pH 9.0 ) distil ( pH 7.0 ) water consume immediately prior daily radiation treatment . OUTLINE : FEASIBILITY PHASE : Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy daily ( QD ) , 5 day week 6 week . Patients drink 8 ounce alkaline water within 30 minute immediately prior undergo radiation therapy . INTERVENTION PHASE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy QD , 5 day week 6 week . Patients drink 8 ounce alkaline water within 30 minute immediately prior undergo radiation therapy . ARM II : Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy arm I . Patients also drink 8 ounce distilled water within 30 minute immediately prior undergo radiation therapy . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
