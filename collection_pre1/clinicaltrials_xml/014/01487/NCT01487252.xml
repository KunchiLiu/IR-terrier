	<brief_summary>An estimate 23 million Americans , include adolescent elderly , suffer circadian rhythm sleep disorder , delay sleep phase disorder , advance sleep phase disorder winter depression . These condition characterize persistent insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness , impaired performance , reduce well low quality life . The negative symptom result misalignment timing sleep internal circadian clock . Clinical research demonstrate circadian rhythm sleep disorder effectively diagnose ( differentiated cause insomnia ) treat individual patient 's circadian phase know . The timing master internal circadian clock reliably measure onset endogenous circadian rhythm melatonin , neuroendocrine hormone , measure dim light ( dim light melatonin onset , `` DLMO '' ) . However date reliable valid assessment DLMO limit research laboratory set . This study test streamline procedure accurate assessment circadian phase ( DLMO ) outside laboratory provide clinicians researcher novel diagnostic research tool . In way underlying neurobiological cause patient 's insomnia and/or circadian rhythm disorder readily diagnose treat . Specific Aim 1 validate procedure at-home circadian phase assessment sample healthy people . Validation occur ( 1 ) objectively measure compliance at-home procedure ( 2 ) compare DLMOs collect home DLMOs collect laboratory , within-subjects counterbalance design . Specific Aim 2 validate home procedure patient delayed sleep phase disorder . Specific Aim 3 conduct rigorous analysis inform future user subject characteristic light level predict ( 1 ) compliance home procedure ( 2 ) valid at-home DLMOs . The result 3 year study substantial implication translation basic clinical research community : ( 1 ) diagnosis treatment insomnia circadian rhythm sleep disorder significantly enhance , thus improve public health safety , mood quality life , ( 2 ) community participation research improve , particularly vulnerable represent population , thus increase scientific knowledge ( 3 ) research clinical cost substantially reduce .</brief_summary>
