	<brief_summary>Very preterm baby frequently develop problem blood circulation first day birth . These circulation problem could affect oxygen blood flow brain lead effect bleed head delay developmental milestone later life . Currently care problem may include transfusion intravenous fluid blood baby and/or give baby medication help circulation . The current practice delivery baby immediately clamp umbilical cord birth . Recent research study show give baby 's blood birth delay cord clamping ( wait clamp cord 30-90 second ) milking cord , may reduce number blood transfusion baby may need later . It may also improve initial blood pressure reduce chance bleed head . More research need prove either delayed cord clamp milk cord birth well term improve baby ' health . The aim study find add blood baby ' circulation , milk cord birth , could prevent reduce possible problem blood circulation reduce blood flow brain baby may birth . The investigator also investigate milk cord birth could improve long-term developmental outcome . Hypothesis : In preterm infant less 31 week ' gestation , milk umbilical cord 3 time prior clamp , compare immediate clamp birth improve systemic blood flow ( assessed improve superior vena cava flow measure heart ultrasound first 24 hour birth )</brief_summary>
