	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle strength training ( RMST ) potential treatment option show increase strength ventilatory function critically ill patient , patient ventilator patient mild neuromuscular weakness . Currently researcher examine role inspiratory muscle strength training ( IMST ) pressure performance ventilator dependent child Pompe disease . However , normal pressure-flow-timing response lung function well-characterized healthy child . The purpose study measure RMST-induced change respiratory function healthy child . Children undergo one session lung function strength test . By study healthy child 's respiratory function , study also help develop efficient respiratory muscle training exercise prescription child neuromuscular weakness impair respiratory function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study collect evaluate respiratory muscle strength training ( RMST ) induce change ventilatory function healthy child . Children undergo one session pulmonary function strength test quantify rate inspiratory expiratory pressure development determine whether inspiratory expiratory pressure correlate maximal respiratory pressure force pulmonary function test . Currently normal pressure-flow-timing response well-characterized healthy child . The purpose study help develop efficient RMST exercise prescription ill child ventilator neuromuscular weakness . Participants study refrain caffeine product exercise day respiratory test . In conjunction respiratory testing , baseline exertional blood pressure , heart respiratory rate , pulse oximetry monitor . Participants complete tidal flow-volume assessment force expiratory maneuver accord AMerican Thoracic Society guideline . Participants undergo 5 set 10 maximal-effort breath standardize resistance ( one set 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 cm H20 ) . Following set , subject rate load magnitude feeling breathe discomfort use 0-10 visual analog scale . Participants also perform maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure maneuver . All test separate least 2-3 minute rest .</detailed_description>
