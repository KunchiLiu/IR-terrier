	<brief_title>A Large Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial Multi-element Psychosocial Intervention Early Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND . It show clinical psychosocial deterioration psychosis occur within first 5 year illness onset , suggest thereby timeframe `` critical '' period initiate treatment . Research therefore recently focus early detection intervention psychosis , show beneficial effect antipsychotic medication first-episode psychosis ( FEP ) temper fact , despite initial symptom reduction , functional recovery typically poor , even optimal pharmacological treatment provide . Family member suffer due high emotional burden caregiver frequently show sign psychological distress . Over last year , grow interest psychosocial intervention mean facilitating recovery reduce long-term disability associate psychosis . Literature psychosocial intervention FEP view term two broad category : 1 ) study evaluate specific ( i.e . single-element ) psychosocial intervention ( e.g . individual cognitive behavioral therapy ) , 2 ) study evaluate comprehensive ( i.e . multi-element ) intervention , may include early detection strategy , individual , group , and/or family therapy , case management ( addition pharmacological treatment ) . The latter appear promise find associated symptom reduction/remission , improve quality life , increase social cognitive functioning , low inpatient admission rate , improve insight , high degree satisfaction treatment , less time spent hospital , decrease substance abuse , few self- harm episode . Most multi-element research program , however , conduct non-epidemiologically representative sample experimental setting , raise risk thereby underestimating complexity involve treat FEP `` real world '' service . Moreover , intervention rarely test efficacy control group , do , use historical prospective comparison group , single-group design , track progress single group give period time . With respect practice , last 10 year , country implement specific early psychosis intervention , even yet become routinely conducted . Few study identify barrier hinder feasibility intervention pinpoint patient family condition render type ineffective inappropriate . Hence , effort implement specific multi-element intervention accompany rigorous scientific methodology , aim well understand actual effectiveness approach . AIMS . The PIANO Trial ( Psychosis early Intervention Assessment Needs Outcome describe herein make part broad-based research program Genetics Endophenotypes Treatment : Understanding early Psychosis ( GET UP , National Coordinator : Prof. Mirella Ruggeri , Verona ) , finance Italian Ministry Health part Ricerca Sanitaria Finalizzata coordinate Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata Verona . GET UP Research Programme consist 4 partner Projects : PIANO ( Psychosis : early Intervention Assessment Needs Outcome ) ; TRUMPET ( TRaining Understanding service Models Psychosis Early Treatment ) ; GUITAR ( Genetic data Utilization Implementation Targeted drug Administration clinical Routine ) ; CONTRABASS ( COgnitive Neuroendophenotypes Treatment RehAbilitation psychosis : Brain imaging , inflAmmation StresS ) . Each partner project pertain different area research , link together high degree harmonization effort . The Trial described herein - main component GET UP PIANO , main data collection axis overall GET UP Research Program - aim : 1 ) test , 9 month , effectiveness , compare treatment usual ( TAU ) multi-component psychosocial intervention large epidemiologically-based cohort FEP patient recruit 10 million inhabitant catchment area ; 2 ) verify clinical routine limit approach , i.e . identify barrier may hinder feasibility patient/family condition render type treatment ineffective inappropriate ; 3 ) identify clinical , psychological , environmental service predictor treatment effectiveness FEP , undertaken Italian community mental health care framework . Study participant recruit Community Mental Health Centres ( CMHCs ) operate Italian National Health Service locate several Northern Central Regions Italy . Specifically , Participating Units ( PU ) locate Veneto Region ( subdivided Western Veneto Eastern Veneto PU ) , Emilia-Romagna Region ( subdivide Emilia Romagna PUs ) provinces Florence , Bolzano , Milano ( subdivide Milan Niguarda Milan San Paolo PUs ) , thus , overall , 10 million-inhabitant catchment area . DESIGN . The GET UP PIANO Trial pragmatic cluster randomize controlled design , compare effectiveness multi-element psychosocial treatment FEP patient family member , versus treatment usual provide Italian community mental health service . A cluster design choose base feasibility consideration . In fact , document draft member MRC Health Services Public Health Research Board 2000 indicate cluster randomisation gold standard approach trial evaluate complex intervention implement institutional level , aim improve health . The assignment unit ( cluster ) catchment area 's CMHC , unit observation analysis Centers ' patient family member . CMHCs enrollment procedure : The PIANO Trial catchment area 126 CMHCs ( 9.951.306 inhabitant ) , officially ask participate GET UP ; 117 accept participate , cover catchment area 9.304.093 inhabitant thereby . In effort improve study design 's efficiency , randomization investigator divide CMHCs stratum , accord three variable : affiliation community psychiatric service , CMHC catchment area size , urban/mixed vs. rural . The socio-economic level trial catchment area find quite homogeneous , variable urban/mixed vs. rural stratification account difference observe . With exception staff member 5 CMHCS ( cover catchment area 503.000 inhabitant ) mental health staff remain 112 CMHCs receive prior training intervention use trial . These first 5 Centers therefore force intervention arm , subgroup use expect `` gold standard '' analysis measure competence remain professional . Thus , 112 CMHCs ( 8.801.093 inhabitant ) available randomization procedure enter randomization procedure , equal number allocate arm . Based administrative data Centers , at-risk population ( 18-54 year ) estimate approximately 50 % total inhabitant . Assuming expected incidence rate 17/100.000 per year non affective affective psychosis ( previously estimate Italy ) investigator expect recruit one year catchment area 800 patient first episode psychosis , 600 relative . Assuming attrition rate 50 % , size trial would detect 9 month difference term primary outcome 25 % TAU arm 10 % intervention arm , power 80 % . Patient- family member enrollment procedure : Patient enrollment take place 1 year interval , 3 month-long piloting . Interventions begin within one month intake , , event , soon patient stabilize . Clinical stabilization define condition allow patient collaborate least brief examination . Patients experimental group receive treatment usual plus : ( ) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) session , ( b ) psycho-educational session family member , c ) Case Manager ( CM ) , serve patient 's referent . Treatment usual conduct control arm CMHSs characterize previous study . The fidelity experimental intervention characteristic treatment usual regularly monitor . BASELINE ASSESSMENT . Before enter study , patient screen positive psychosis ask provide inform consent participate . When patient consider clinically stabilize ( intake ) , assess independent evaluator set standardized instrument measure : substance abuse ( Clinical Drug Use Scale , CDUS ) , symptom ( Positive Negative Syndrome Scale , PANSS ; Hamilton Rating Scale Depression , HAMD ; Bech-Rafaelsen Mania rating Scale , BRMRS ) ; global functioning ( Global Assessment Functioning , GAF ) ; Subjective appraisal positive symptom ( Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales , PSYRATS ) , social disability ( Disability Assessment Scale , WHO-DAS ) , insight ( Schedule Assessment Insight , SAI-E ) , need care ( Camberwell Assessment Need , CAN-EU ) , quality life ( WHO-QOL ) , life event ( first 14 year life , one year prior onset psychosis , period follow onset measure ad hoc schedule Life Events , CECA-Q ) , parental bonding ( Parental Bonding Instrument , PBI ) , express emotion ( Level Expressed Emotion Scale , LEE ) . Participating patient ask consent involve family member trial , give , family member also provide inform consent assess regard burden care ( Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire , IEQ ) emotional distress ( General Health Questionnaire , GHQ ) ; also interview respect patient 's pre-morbid adjustment ( Pre-morbid Adjustment Scale , PAS ) obstetric complication birth . FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT . After 9 month baseline , patient re-assessed substance abuse , psychotic symptom ( PANSS PSYRATS ) depression ( HAMD , BRMS ) , global functioning ( GAF ) , social disability ( WHO DAS ) , insight ( SAI-E ) , need care ( CAN ) , quality life ( WHO-QoL ) . Moreover , patient evaluate term pharmacological side effect , pattern clinical course ( Life Chart Schedule ) , service satisfaction ( Verona Service Satisfaction Scale-Patient version , VSSSP ) . Family member re-assessed respect burden care ( IEQ ) emotional distress ( GHQ ) ; also assess service satisfaction ( VSSS-Relative version ) .</detailed_description>
