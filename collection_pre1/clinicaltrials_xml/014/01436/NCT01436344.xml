	<brief_summary>With use esophageal Holter electrocardiography ( eECG ) , investigator look surrogate marker paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . To , investigator record eECGs patient know paroxysmal atrial fibrillation time eECG-recording sinus rhythm . To identify marker , eECGs patient compare group control sinus rhythm without atrial fibrillation . The investigator hypothesis possible identify surrogate marker patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The fast correct diagnosis heart rhythm disorder important reduce morbidity mortality cardiovascular patient . Atrial fibrillation special interest , important cause devastate brain stroke . A significant number stroke cardioembolic genesis due paroxysmal atrial fibrillation diagnose early enough . Therefore , important detect atrial fibrillation soon possible . With oral anticoagulation effective therapeutic option available prevent cardioembolisms . In clinical routine , mostly 24-hour 7-day ECGs make look cardiac arrhythmia . The use uf device well establish . Nevertheless , side effects/limitations . Skin electrode use derivation ECG often cause skin irritation , sometimes leading premature termination recording . Because dryout contact gel ( cause artifact ) , small p-waves especially also motion artifact , trigger record semi-automatic analysis record problematic , longer record time semi-automatic analysis would helpful . As alternative esophageal electrocardiography perform . Signal quality ECG recording ( especially leave atrium ) well standard surface ECG vicinity esophagus leave atrium . The esophagus tolerate well foreign body know long-term nasogastric intubation . Therefore use esophageal technique long-term rhythm monitoring interest promising alternative conventional surface Holter ECGs . The diagnosis paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( pAF ) make episode atrial fibrillation occur long-term ECG recording . Surrogate marker pAF could identify `` population risk '' pAF suspect although show sinus rhythm time record . In surface ECG marker suspect . The use esophageal long-term electrocardiography well signal property promise alternative find surrogate marker risk stratification . Objective Identification characterization surrogate marker indicative pAF patient sinus rhythm time record . Methods A total 60 patient include identify characterize surrogate marker pAF . Cases know pAF consecutively recruit cardiology ward cardiological ambulatory . After inclusion , age ( +/- one year ) gender adjust control person without know pAF ( negative 7-day ECG within previous 365 day study inclusion ) match every patient . Cases control receive simultaneous 24-hour esophageal electrocardiography standard surface electrocardiography . Controls without negative 7-day ECG within past year wear surface ECG recorder additional 6 day ( total surface ECG record 7 day ) . In case paroxysmal atrial fibrillation detect first time study , patient allocate `` case '' group . Additionally , patient LA diameter parasternal measure echocardiographically .</detailed_description>
