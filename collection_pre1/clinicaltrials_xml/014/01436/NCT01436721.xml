	<brief_summary>Hepatectomy one best treatment malignant benign lesion liver . The mortality morbidity rate hepatectomy declined recent year precise measurement liver functional reserve , good understand liver anatomy , meticulous haemostasis operation improve postoperative management . Although surgical technique improve , life-threatening complication , intra-abdominal bleeding , bile leakage subphrenic infection , complete avoid . The local complication associate liver section treatment operation . Hence , need safer effective hemostatic treatment conventional approach , intraoperative pressure surgical gauze , ligatures , electrocoagulation mono- bipolar instrument . Surgicel® absorbable Haemostat sterile absorbable knit fabric prepare controlled oxidation regenerate cellulose . After Surgicel® saturate blood , swell brownish black gelatinous mass aid formation clot , thereby serve haemostatic adjunct control local haemorrhage barrier section . The present randomized clinical trial design evaluate efficacy safety Surgicel® absorbable Haemostat cover raw cut surface hepatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , single-center investigation minimum forty ( 40 ) control study subject design evaluate safety effectiveness Surgicel® absorbable Haemostat absorbable hemostat hepatic surgical patient population . Subjects undergoing hepatic surgical procedure consider investigation . The raw cut surface cover Surgicel® absorbable Haemostat none dry use fine suture argon beam achieve complete haemostasis . Subjects pre-screened utilizing standard care data specify inclusion/exclusion criterion ensure eligible treatment investigation . If subject appear qualify investigation , subject ask give his/her write informed consent . All subject follow hospitalization . Follow-up evaluation include time removal wound drain , amount effusion , length postoperative hospital stay , incidence postoperative morbidity . From baseline final study exam , data pertain investigational objective record appropriate case report form predetermine study interval .</detailed_description>
