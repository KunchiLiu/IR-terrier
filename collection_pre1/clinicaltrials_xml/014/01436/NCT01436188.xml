	<brief_title>A Study Measure CSF Proteins Elderly Healthy Volunteers Volunteers With Mild Cognitive Impairment Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study measure specific proteins cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) healthy elderly volunteer volunteer mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . No investigational medical drug give volunteer participation study . Healthy elderly volunteer enrol Part A study randomize ( assigned chance ) 1 4 cohort ( group ) ; cohort volunteer undergo different type CSF sampling procedure ( standard frequent CSF sampling procedure , alternative frequency CSF sampling procedure , standard frequent CSF sample procedure 800 mg ibuprofen administer volunteer Day 1 , alternative low frequency CSF sample comparison Cohort 1 ) blood sample collect . Volunteers MCI AD enrol Part B study undergo 1 CSF sample procedure ( ie , standard frequent CSF sample procedure ) . In addition , volunteer enrol consent ( agree ) pharmacogenomic component study , blood sample collect allow genetic research help understand link Alzheimer 's Disease biomarker profile specific genotype DNA sample store future genetic research relate CSF proteins Alzheimer 's Disease . Participation pharmacogenomic research optional volunteer enrol Part A Cohort 1 3 required volunteer enrol Part A Cohort 5 Part B . Participation DNA storage component optional refusal participate result ineligibility main part study . There blind study ( ie , volunteer know CSF sample procedure perform ) . CSF blood sample collect period 36 hour maximum duration study 6 week . During study , volunteer monitor evaluate safety tolerability CSF sampling procedure .</detailed_description>
