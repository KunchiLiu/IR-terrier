	<detailed_description>A two stage , phase I/II , double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled study hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) uninfected male female injection drug user ( IDU ) age 18 45 . In clinical trial AdCh3NSmut1 MVA-NSMut HCV vaccine administer intramuscularly 68 ( +/-4 ) evaluable volunteer stage 1 . A planned interim analysis safety immunogenicity conduct base data 1 week receipt second vaccination . If safety signal detect evidence measurable immune response HCV additional 472 ( +/-4 ) volunteer enrol stage 2 . The primary objective study 1 ) ass safety new candidate hepatitis C virus vaccine , AdCh3NSmut1 MVA-NSmut , compare placebo administer HCV-uninfected injection drug user ( IDUs ) 2 ) determine AdCh3NSmut1 MVA-NSmut HCV vaccine reduce incidence chronic HCV infection compare placebo among HCV-uninfected IDUs . The secondary objective study evaluate immunogenicity new candidate hepatitis C virus vaccine , AdCh3NSmut1 MVA-NSmut , compare placebo administer HCV-uninfected IDUs.The plan duration study approximately 63 month total include accrual time subject ( assume 31 month screening/enrollments , plus 3 month halt enrollment first interim analysis ) , 2 month vaccination , 18 month follow-up enrol subject , 9 month extend observation ( monthly ) , time infection , subject become viremic last month follow-up .</detailed_description>
