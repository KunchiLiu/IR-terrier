	<brief_title>Study Antibodies Anti-TNF Agents Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) umbrella term heterogeneous group inflammatory arthropathy affect child young adult common rheumatic disease pediatric population . In high-income country yearly incidence 2-20 case per 100 000 population prevalence 16-150 case per 100 000 population . Treatment JIA include combination pharmacological intervention , physical occupational therapy , psychosocial support . Although definitive cure still available , prognosis patient JIA improve greatly recent year due improve disease management introduction biologics provide efficient alternative patient nonresponsive treatment . Traditionally , biologic treatment JIA focus block one central mediator inflammatory response , cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . Currently three anti-TNF agent available treatment JIA : infliximab , adalimumab etanercept . One major drawback therapeutic production anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) correlate increase risk adverse event loss drug efficacy . The study evaluate frequency formation anti-infliximab antibody patient treat infliximab , anti-adalimumab antibody patient treat adalimumab anti-etanercept antibody patient treat etanercept . A common practice case nonresponsive one describe anti-TNF agent discontinuation therapy switch different ant-TNF agent . Therefore , frequency formation antibody describe anti-TNF agent also compare patient previously receive different anti-TNF agent patient receive previous anti-TNF therapy . The result study highlight risk formation antibody three different anti-TNF biologic agent use therapy JIA either alone previous discontinuation different anti-TNF agent .</detailed_description>
