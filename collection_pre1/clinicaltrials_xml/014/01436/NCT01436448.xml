	<brief_summary>Introduction : The overall aim study assess efficacy Lactobacillus Rhamnosus reduce glucose intolerance pregnancy . A second objective study determine feasibility , compliance safety Lactobacillus Rhamnosus among cohort . Within goal determine whether investigator enroll woman high risk develop Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ( GDM ) follow regular antenatal visit 6-weeks post partum . Women GDM , 7 time risk develop type 2 diabetes compare normo- glycaemic pregnancy . The population attributable risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) woman GDM high , around 30 - 50 % woman GDM convert type 2 ( DM ) associate pre-mature morbidity , mortality high economic burden . It evident untreated GDM associate high incidence complication pregnancy increase risk perinatal mortality infant morbidity . The prevalence GDM Pakistan around 8 % , comparatively high South Asian country . Therefore , intervention improve glucose regulation pregnancy highly important . Probiotics , live micro-organism , show promising result regulate glucose metabolism among pregnant mouse . The effect Probiotics glucose metabolism attributable immuno-regulatory property . They elicit powerful anti-inflammatory capability inhibit NF-kB pathway , mediate microbial activation immune system . Further , diminish fermentation polysaccharide induction fasting-induced adipocyte factor gene transcription . The safety Lactobacillus Rhamnosus among pregnant woman already establish disease . A placebo control trial Finland pregnant female randomize receive either dietary counseling Probiotics ( Lactobacillus Rhamnosus ) , conclude improve glucose tolerance compare placebo group [ OR 0.31 ( 95 % CI 0.12 , 0.78 ) ] . However , study could determine sole effect probiotic reduce glucose intolerance . Nevertheless , study role Lactobacillus Rhamnosus regulate glucose intolerance conduct part world yet . Therefore , pilot trial see efficacy , compliance feasibility Lactobacillus Rhamnosus among pregnant female imperative . The objective investigator study : - To assess efficacy Probiotics Lactobacillus Rhamnosus ( 1010 Colony form Units ( CFU ) /day ) reduce glucose intolerance among pregnant woman attend antenatal clinic Karachi-Pakistan . - To assess feasibility , compliance safety conduct double blind , placebo control randomized trial Lactobacillus Rhamnosus recruit high risk woman pregnancy attend antenatal clinic follow 6 week postpartum Karachi-Pakistan . Methods : For pilot trial , woman recruit antenatal hospital city , 12-14 week gestation . Study Design : The study double blind randomize , placebo control trial . Randomization do block method . The dose 1010 Colony form Units ( CFU ) daily till delivery give orally . Study Endpoints Ascertainment : Baseline information comprise socioeconomic status , parity , gravida , blood pressure obstetric history etc . The study endpoint comprises efficacy , feasibility , compliance safety ascertain monthly follow-up , week 24 - 28 , 6 week post partum . Efficacy ascertain Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) perform randomization 24-28 week gestation . Feasibility compliance assess recruitment rate , drop-out rate , reason drop-out , non-participation empty drug sachet count .</brief_summary>
