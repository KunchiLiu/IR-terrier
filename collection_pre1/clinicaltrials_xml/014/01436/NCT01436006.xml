	<brief_summary>The situation Italy regard radiation dose patient undergoing Multidetector row Computed Tomography ( MDCT ) scan unclear despite Italian law require centre check Reference Dose Level ( RDL ) every two year . RDL CT first suggest document 1998 publish European Commission ( EUR16262/1998 ) base result old survey UK late 1980s . Those RDLs , express term Computed Tomography Dose Index ( CTDI ) Dose Length Product ( DLP ) , report Italian law ( D.Lgs.187/00 ) . However , Italy governmental authority comparable UK 's National Radiological Protection Board , depute dose evaluation protection . An overview Italian situation relevant order know actual dose level MDCT administer patient adults paediatrics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adult Paediatric Patient Radiation Doses From Multidetector Row Computed Tomography Scans : National Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT image rapidly grow represent indispensable medical procedure many clinical condition . The widespread availability expand use multidetector CT ( MSCT ) due high performance short acquisition time , result increase frequency procedure level patient exposure CT scan examination , issue relate radiation , include potential risk , relatively neglected . Particular attention give CT scan child , represent 10 % X-ray study perform , account 75 % total dose administer . CT child perform absolutely necessary long life expectation sensitivity X-ray radiation may increase risk cause radiation-induced neoplasm 's late year . According 2000 report United Nations Scientific Committee Effects Atomic Radiation ( UNSCEAR ) frequency CT examination country high healthcare level increase factor 8 ; mean effective dose increase 1,3 mSv 1970s 8,8 mSv per year per 1000 person early 1990s . In Switzerland , Germany United Kingdom increase number report CT examination range 39 % 70 % period 1998-2002 . The 2000 ISTAT report 's estimate 1479 CT apparatus instal Italy perform total 3.327.750 CT examination [ 3 ] . Considering increase 40 % every 5 year , comparable European country , 6.000.000 CT examination estimate 2010 . The primary objective study obtain snapshot Italian CT practice adult child up-to-date regard information concern multidetector 16- 64- row CT. A second goal update national reference dose level . The study establish sustainable database ongoing collation data local survey CT . This facilitate analysis trend periodic review national reference dos CT way similar European country . Radiology department deal adult paediatric CT Italy receive invitation participate survey questionnaire regard important feature CT equipment . Four common protocol use dose calculation : CT scan head , lumbar spine , chest abdomen . Cardiac CT data collect adult , child examination , MR commonly prefer CT radioprotection reason . All radiology department use 16 64 multidetector CT seek enrolment study . Centres perform least 2000 MDCT examination either adult paediatrics one year regular quality control CT scanner include survey list divide accord geographical site , namely four macro-areas Northern Italy , Centre , Southern Italy Islands . Each enrol centre receive standardize form fill . The main technical parameter include questionnaire : CT scanner manufacturer , model type , characteristic automatic modulation system ( modulation direction choose image quality level e.g . Noise Index effective mAs ) . Tube voltage ( kV ) , current ( mA ) , tube rotation time ( ) , slice thickness , total acquisition time ( ) , pitch , filtration also give . For patient examination Volumetric Computed Tomography Dose Index ( CTDIvol ) Dose Length Product ( DLP ) collect dose report . For cardiac protocol , dedicate questionnaire distribute include typical cardiac parameter addition mention . For protocol perform adult , data request normal patient ( exclude excessively small large ) . For child , age examination weight include . Paediatric study person le 16 year old , establish Italian regulation . In order verify accuracy console displayed value medical physicist measure start survey CTDIvol follow European Guidelines EUR16262/1998 . Errors le 10 % measure report value accept . Each protocol analyse separately descriptive statistical analysis main parameter perform . These include sample size , range , median , mean value , third quartile percentage coefficient variation . The survey conduct period twelve month . The data treat anonymous way , centre cod alphabetical letter . The investigator calculate sample size 2,421 MDCT examination protocol sufficient guarantee confidence 90 % absolute error 5 % average dose , simple random sample assume conservative hypothesis population standard deviation five time estimate similar German survey [ 4 ] . In order increase accuracy estimation investigator adopt stratified random sample scheme consist stratification four geographical Italian macro-areas random selection number MDCT examination proportional population live macro-area . Stratification facilitate task data collection survey , aide remove possible source bias relate different frequency MDCT apparatus , MDCT service cluster internally homogeneous stratum .</detailed_description>
