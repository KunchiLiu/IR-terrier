	<brief_title>Effectiveness Guided Imagery Intervention Factors Associated With Maternal Stress Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth ( PTB ) lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality tremendous health economic cost infant , family , society . There little success reduce PTB ; rate time high . Of particular concern major racial disparity PTB rate ; African American woman high proportion PTB compare woman race ethnicity . There grow evidence suggest PTB may end point sub-acute chronic pathophysiological change occur clinical symptom preterm labor present . There also evidence suggest psychosocial factor maternal stress relate symptom fatigue , anxiety , depression , well unhappiness pregnancy associate negative birth outcome . It propose behavioral factor could influence birth outcome two possible pathway : ( 1 ) neuroendocrine pathway maternal stress may lead early and/or great activation maternal-placental-fetal endocrine system , CRH play key role , thereby promote labor ; and/or ( 2 ) immunologic inflammatory pathway may promote labor pro-inflammatory mechanism . Experts agree primary prevention intervention need address issue PTB . Guided imagery ( GI ) effective decrease self-reported measure stress , depression , fatigue well influence neuroendocrine immune measure general population . However , limited study examine effect GI maternal stress , neuroendocrine measure , and/or birth outcome , publish study examine effect GI primary prevention intervention improve birth outcome reduce stress relate symptom influence propose immunologic pathway PTB . The specific aim randomize clinical trial ( 1 ) test effect GI intervention maternal stress ( perceived stress ) , relate symptom ( fatigue , anxiety , depression , unhappiness ) , neuroendocrine ( CRH ) immunological mediator ( IL-1β , IL-6 , Il-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF-α , IFN-γ , G-CSF , GM-CSF ) , birth outcome ( gestational age neonatal birthweight ) African American woman ; ( 2 ) test propose theoretical model examine predict relationship among stress , fatigue , anxiety , depression , unhappiness , pattern neuroendocrine immunologic factor , birth outcome . An analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model use test group difference GI control group . To test propose theoretical model descriptive statistic , graphical method pairwise correlation calculate baseline data canonical correlation analysis use look relationship among group baseline variable . Demonstrating effectiveness economical , easy distribute use , intervention psychosocial factor associate PTB propose pathway lead adverse birth outcomes tremendous health , social financial benefit . This project provide baseline data research test biobehavioral efficacy intervention large sample multiple races/ethnicities well test model postpartum period maternal well-being infant development .</detailed_description>
