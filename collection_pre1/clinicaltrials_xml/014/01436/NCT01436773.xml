	<brief_summary>Adventitial vas vasorum ( VV ) well intraplaque microvessels know associated atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability . Contrast-enhanced ultrasound validate technique measure density VV . Previous study demonstrate relationship identification VV relationship vascular event stroke myocardial infarction . No previous study report utilization contrast-enhanced ultrasound identification VV carotid bed mean identify patient high risk acute coronary event . Aims : In study , investigator aim identify VV intraplaque microvessels along carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) , know marker acute coronary event . The investigator attempt measure correlation VV acute coronary event independent traditional cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor CIMT . Methods : 90 volunteer ( 30 low risk patient , 30 patient establish coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , 30 patient recent acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ) enrol . All patient undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound image carotid artery measurement CIMT obtain baseline history assessment traditional risk factor coronary artery disease . VV density CIMT measure patient . Statistical difference VV among three group assess analysis make attempt identify VV carotid bed independent predictor acute coronary event control CIMT traditional risk factor . Study population : The study population reflect patient population UPMC . No individual exclude basis race , gender , ethnicity .</brief_summary>
