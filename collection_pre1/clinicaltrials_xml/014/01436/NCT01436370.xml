	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , Phase II study adult Rheumatoid Arthritis receive TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy , age 18 year 64 year age . This study design investigate immunogenicity , safety , reactogenicity two different dos inactivate trivalent influenza virus vaccine give two dose level ( 15 mcg 60 mcg ) administer IM individual rheumatoid arthritis receive anti-TNF-alpha therapy age gender match control subject . The study conduct two season , 2011-2012 2012-2013 . Subjects enrol October 2011 February 2012 receive 2011-2012 vaccine , enrol July 2012 receive 2012-2013 vaccine . Immunogenicity test determine proportion subject group titer 4-fold rise HAI titer ( define either pre-vaccination HAI titer &lt; 1:10 post-vaccination HAI titer &gt; /=1:40 pre-vaccination HAI titer &gt; /=1:10 minimum four-fold rise post-vaccination HAI titer ) specific influenza strain include vaccine subject receive day 21 follow vaccination . The proportion subject group achieve serum HAI titer &gt; /= 1:40 4-fold rise HAI titer great HAI titer strain vaccine compare control subject . Safety test assess occurrence vaccine-associated Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) throughout course study , occurrence solicit local systemic adverse event ( AEs ) within 8 day post vaccination . Solicited AEs ( include rheumatoid arthritis clinical status ) assess course study . Subjects four face face visit one telephone contact . Day 0 include consent process , medical history physical exam RA subject assess activity RA time enrollment , vital sign , phlebotomy prevaccine serology . Subjects randomize receive IM seasonal TIV High-Dose TIV visit receive assign vaccine . They observe 20 minute teach fill 7 day memory aid assess daily temperature , local systemic reactogenicity . A telephone call make assess reactogenicity review memory aid day 3 . Subjects return day 7 review memory aid , AEs/SAEs , vital sign phlebotomy serology . A physical exam perform indicate . They return day 21 6 month review AEs/SAEs , vital sign phlebotomy serology . A physical exam perform indicate .</detailed_description>
