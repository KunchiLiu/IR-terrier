	<brief_title>Antithyroid Drug Treatment Thyrotoxicosis Young People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyrotoxicosis uncommon disorder childhood adolescence UK incidence around 1 per 100,000 ( 0-15 year ) . Most patient thyrotoxicosis Graves ' disease develop thyrotropin ( TSH ) receptor stimulation autoantibody . Patients Hashimoto 's thyroiditis also thyrotoxic early phase disease occasionally thyrotoxicosis develops activate mutation TSH receptor . Many general paediatrician experience manage patient thyrotoxicosis national guideline assist patient care produce date . There ideal therapy thyrotoxicosis child adolescent . The three treatment modality thyrotoxicosis - anti-thyroid drug ( ATD ) , surgery radioiodine significant disadvantage . Particular consideration manage young people include : 1 . Low remission rate follow course ATD . 2 . Concerns morbidity associate thyroidectomy . 3 . Inadequate data regard long term safety radioiodine . Children adolescents present autoimmune thyrotoxicosis UK usually treat ATD diagnosis 1 - 4 year . Treatment stop patient relapse return ATD offer definitive treatment surgery radioiodine . Life-long thyroid hormone replacement require thyroid gland remove surgery ablate radioiodine . Excess thyroid hormone major detrimental impact cognitive function well cardiovascular skeletal health . The maintenance clinically biochemically euthyroid state therefore highly desirable . There two possible approach treat patient ATD . - 'Block replace ' ( combine ) therapy - thyroid hormone production prevent ATD thyroxine add replacement dose . - 'Dose titration ' ( adaptive ) therapy - dose ATD adjust hormone production normalise . Both strategy use adult endocrinologist unclear approach appropriate young person . Potential advantage 'block replace ' regimen include : - Improved stability few episode hyper hypothyroidism . - A reduced number venepunctures visit hospital . - Improved remission rate follow large anti-thyroid drug dose . Potential advantage dose titration approach include : - Fewer side effect low anti-thyroid drug dose - Improved compliance one rather two medication . A meta-analysis conduct primarily adult patient conclude 'dose titration ' appropriate way manage thyrotoxicosis few ATD-related side-effects although group author subsequently highlight significant limitation study . This study prospective , multi-centre trial aim establish regimen - block replace dose titration - appropriate medical therapy thyrotoxicosis childhood adolescence . - Primary completion date change January 2019 November 2014 - Study completion date change January 2019 November 2015</detailed_description>
