	<brief_summary>The drug investigate study Rivaroxaban , novel , once-daily , oral anticoagulant prevention ( prophylaxis ) deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) may lead pulmonary embolism ( PE ) people undergo knee hip replacement surgery . The purpose study establish bioequivalence 2 immediate-release tablet treatment Rivaroxaban : 2*5 mg tablet 1*10 mg tablet give healthy volunteer fast condition ; administer single oral dos 2 period . Both period separate 7-day washout phase . Thus , bioequivalence represent primary study objective . As secondary objective , treatment assess term safety tolerability . Bioequivalence evaluate verified basis pharmacokinetic data . Blood sample volunteer take specific point time ; sample analyzed use various statistical method establish pharmacokinetic characteristic require compare 2 treatment . The planned treatment Rivaroxaban consider bioequivalent specific criterion define study protocol meet . The study conduct one center Germany . 28 subject meet inclusion criterion participate . They treat accord single-dose , randomize , 2-way cross-over , non-placebo-controlled design .</brief_summary>
