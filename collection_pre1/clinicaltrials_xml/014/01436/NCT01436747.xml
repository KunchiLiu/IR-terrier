	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Paricalcitol Reduction Proteinuria Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation treatment choice end-stage renal disease patient . In comparison dialysis offer longer survival well quality life certain patient end stage renal disease . In last two decade , short-term ( i.e . 1- 3-year ) kidney transplant survival increase significantly currently exceed 90 % state-of-the-art transplant center . This consider due safe effective immunosuppressive therapy early post-transplant period , careful management patient chronic renal disease ( CRD ) transplantation . In spite progress describe , long-term ( i.e . 5- 10-year ) transplant survival significantly improve recent decade . Two main cause long-term loss transplant kidney development transplant chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( i.e . chronic allograft nephropathy ) patient death functioning transplant due cardiovascular event . Proteinuria ( &gt; 150 mg protein urine per day ) manifestation kidney disease important risk factor CKD progression . This apply also kidney transplant recipient . Studies show proteinuria present 20-40 % transplanted patient . According observational study , proteinuria independent predictor CKD progression transplant failure , well increase risk cardiovascular event . In CKD patient , treatment renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor ( RAAS - angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker , aldosterone receptor blocker ) reduces proteinuria thus slow renal disease progression . In spite demonstrate renoprotective effect RAAS inhibitor , risk CKD progression remain high . Furthermore , large epidemiological study show clinically significant effect RAAS inhibitor therapy reduction cardiovascular risk . In spite optimal RAAS inhibitor therapy , renal cardiovascular disease continue progress , also associate persistent proteinuria . Therefore , new treatment modality reduce proteinuria consequent delay progression CKD cardiovascular disease seek . Calcitriol active form vitamin D produce kidney . It important calcium phosphate metabolism , well bone mineralization . Decreasing blood calcitriol level associate decline renal function . Decreased calcitriol level patient CKD contribute development secondary hyperparathyroidism . Furthermore , calcitriol deficiency associate increase proteinuria progression renal impairment . Vitamin D deficiency patient end stage renal disease also relate high cardiovascular mortality . The pleiotropic effect calcitriol probably reflect presence vitamin D receptor different tissue ; via receptor calcitriol exerts pharmacological effect . Vitamin D receptor find kidney bone , also cell myocardium , vascular endothelium , endocrine part pancreas , intestine prostate . Treatment analogue active vitamin D form , paricalcitol , significantly reduce proteinuria slow progression renal disease animal model well patient CKD , particularly patient diabetes diabetic nephropathy . This consider due positive effect paricalcitol RAAS inhibition kidney , independent calcium parathormone metabolism . Reduced proteinuria lead reduced inflammatory response , preservation glomerular basement membrane structure slow glomerulosclerosis . The positive effect paricalcitol reduction proteinuria observe patient CKD may also important kidney transplant recipient : reduce proteinuria , progression CKD transplant kidney might delay risk cardiovascular event reduce . This might contribute improvement long-term kidney transplant survival , change significantly last two decade . This study test hypothesis whether paricalcitol persistently reduce proteinuria kidney transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
