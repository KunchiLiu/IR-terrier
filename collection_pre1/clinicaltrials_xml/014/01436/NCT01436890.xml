	<brief_summary>Asthma common , chronic inflammatory disease bronchial airway , report prevalence industrialized country 5 10 % adult population . Asthma clinically characterize repeat episode wheeze , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough ; usually presence variable airflow obstruction often reversible either spontaneously treatment ( The Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) , 2009 ) . Drug treatment asthma focus anti-inflammatory therapy mild , intermittent case . Inhaled corticosteroid show anti-inflammatory asthma , chronic use agent may associate range side effect , especially high dos . In asthma , remain need development novel anti-inflammatory therapy least equally effective posse superior safety profile comparison corticosteroid . This randomized , double-blind , triple dummy , placebo control , parallel group , dose range study . The study conduct adult patient diagnosis chronic persistent asthma Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) 50 % 80 % predict value . Study enroll 448 patient globally ( 278 India ) across different center . Patients recruit provide write informed consent . After screen run period , patient randomize ( patient meeting randomization criterion ) 1:1:1:1 ratio receive either one three dose regimen revamilast placebo . The primary objective study evaluate effect revamilast lung function assess Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) therapy ( 12 week ) . Secondary objective include area curve FEV1 , Change asthma symptom , patient / investigator 's global assessment safety . Patients follow safety efficacy assessment week 1 , 4 , 8 12 14 start therapy .</brief_summary>
