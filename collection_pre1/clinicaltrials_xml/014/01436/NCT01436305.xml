	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether new drug , Nulojix速 ( belatacept ) , would minimize serious long term side effect associate anti-rejection medication still protect new kidney damage . The researcher also want learn safety treatment long term health transplant kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization NULOJIX速 Usage As A Means Avoiding CNI Steroids Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dialysis kidney transplant two way treat kidney failure . Transplant recipient take anti-rejection medication prevent immune system ( body 's natural defense system illness ) reject new kidney . Most patient undergo kidney transplant must take anti-rejection medication rest life . Taking standard anti-rejection medication long time cause serious side effect , include kidney damage . There would benefit find new anti-rejection medication work well , n't damage kidney .</detailed_description>
