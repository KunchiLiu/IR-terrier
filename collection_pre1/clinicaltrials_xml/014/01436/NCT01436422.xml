	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Two Admixtures Tetravalent Dengue Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue virus cause dengue fever severe condition , dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome . Dengue virus common tropical subtropical region world infection dengue virus lead cause hospitalization death child many tropical Asian country . For reason , World Health Organization ( WHO ) make development dengue virus vaccine top priority . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos live , attenuate , tetravalent dengue virus vaccine call TetraVax-DV healthy adult . Two different version TetraVax-DV vaccine evaluate . This study enroll healthy adult 18-50 year old . Participants randomly assign receive one two admixtures TetraVax-DV vaccine placebo . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , vital sign measurement , pregnancy test female . Participants receive one injection assign vaccine upper arm . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic 30 minute observation monitoring . At home , participant monitor record temperature three time day 16 day . Additional study visit occur Days 3 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 150 include physical examination , assessment symptom , blood collection . On Day 180 , participant receive second injection vaccine receive baseline study visit . Follow-up study visit occur Days 183 , 188 , 190 , 192 , 194 , 196 , 201 , 208 , 236 , 270 , 360 , include study procedure monitor occur first vaccination .</detailed_description>
