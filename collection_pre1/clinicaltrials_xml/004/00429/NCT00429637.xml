	<brief_summary>Given possible prognostic relationship exhale breath condensate pH clinical symptom , quite plausible exhaled breath condensate pH prove useful intensive care unit . For example , exhale breath condensate pH fall prior onset clinical symptom , likely useful early marker , herald onset various inflammatory lung disease . Specifically , exhale breath condensate pH could use safe , non-invasive screen tool Ventilator Associated Pneumonia . Similarly , change exhale breath condensate pH might predict onset disease , exhale breath condensate pH change might also mark progression resolution disease ( e.g . alert clinician possible readiness extubation ) . Although notion hypothetical , begin support anecdotal evidence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Exhaled Breath Condensate pH Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator develop method collect exhale breath condensate pH continually ventilate patient , ( 1 ) take sample exhaust port outside ventilator circuit , ( 2 ) posse measurable resistance ventilator circuit ( , therefore sample procedure way affect patient ) . Now , additionally , perform continuous collection process 10 patient intensive care unit , none ill effect collection process . The placement exhale breath condensate collection device ventilator exhaust port offer simplify , accurate , safe method investigate relationship airway pH various pulmonary inflammatory disease process intubated patient age . In order extend study airway pH intubated subject , believe necessary obtain frequent exhale breath condensate pH measurement intubated subject . To end , develop collection system also measure pH collect exhaled breath condensate fashion similar methodology use thousand assays laboratory laboratory globally . This involve deaeration sample remove carbon dioxide . In lab environment , perform Argon . In ICU setting , accomplish effect use wall oxygen . The continuous exhale breath condensate pH collection assay system consist condenser attach exhaust port ventilator . The condenser keep chill slightly freezing temperature refrigeration system commonly employ ICU setting . The collection device stay attach exhalation port ventilator continuously , hour day . Collected exhale breath condensate channel two deaeration chamber , wall oxygen bubble ( total flow 1 liter/min ) . In second deaeration chamber , micro pH electrode insert . This pH electrode attach pH recorder internal memory record essentially infinite number measurement , allow length duration monitoring . This recorder evaluate clinical engineering radio frequency interference clear hospital use . After measurement pH , exhale breath condensate channel waste chamber . The breath condensate collection system maintain chill `` hospital grade '' Electri-Cool II model 767 refrigerate cooling system ( near-equivalent ) clinically approve use intensive care unit . This device approximately 30 cm side , keep wheeled cart way clinical activity . Hypothesis Tested : Clearly state objective hypotheses clearly define primary secondary outcome measure . 1 . Exhaled breath condensate pH great within-hour variability subject lung disease subject intubate non-pulmonary reason . 2 . Exhaled breath condensate pH rise prior readiness extubation infant toddler require mechanical ventilation acute bronchiolitis . 3 . A decline exhale breath condensate pH increase exhale breath condensate pH variability predict onset pulmonary inflammatory process ( ventilator-associated pneumonia ) initially require mechanical ventilation non-inflammatory reason .</detailed_description>
