	<detailed_description>Cancer skin common cancer , probably account 50 % cancer . Melanoma account 4 % skin cancer case cause large majority skin cancer death . The American Cancer Society estimate 62,190 new melanoma diagnose United States 2006 . DTIC chemotherapy drug approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma . The reported response rate 5-20 % without evidence prolong survival randomized clinical trial versus best supportive care . The median overall survival melanoma patient treat DTIC alone approximately 8 month ; PFS TTP follow treatment DTIC approximately 7 week , objective response rate DTIC alone ( CR+PR ) less 10 % ( Millward , 2004 ) . Other chemotherapy agent include cisplatin carboplatin , BCNU , vindesine , paclitaxel , docetaxel , vinorelbine also test none improve upon modest activity DTIC . Melanoma may optimal target JX-594 immunotherapy relatively high rate accessible disease injection , positive response melanoma see IL-2 immunotherapy , lack effective , tolerable therapy patient metastatic melanoma . Furthermore , speculate JX-594 replication target EGFR pathway , highly express melanocyte . Results initial Phase I/II study suggest intratumoral injection JX-594 safe effective treating inject distant disease patient surgically incurable metastatic melanoma . Response inject tumor ( 5 7 patient ) response least one non-injected tumor ( 4 7 patient ) demonstrate , include two patient achieve partial response ( 6 + month ) complete response ( 4 + month ) JX-594 treatment . Particularly noteworthy efficacy gene expression occur despite pre-treatment vaccination ( , therefore , pre-existing anti-vaccinia immunity ) patient .</detailed_description>
