	<detailed_description>Studies confirm ability dasatinib inhibit numerous kinase ( 76 148 kinase test one series ) .13 Overexpression dysregulation number kinase implicate pathophysiology MM could serve potential target inhibition dasatinib . Fibroblast growth factor 3 ( FGFR3 ) , normally express plasma cell , aberrantly express 15 % multiple myeloma patient . Its expression result translocation t4 ; 14.14 Dasatinib weakly inhibits FGFR3.13 Another target inhibition multiple myeloma epidermal growth factor receptor family , particularly ErbB4 . In vitro , ErbB4 express 4 9 myeloma cell line , panErbB inhibitor induces apoptosis myeloma cell lines.15 Dasatinib show moderate affinity ErbB4.13 Members src family protein-tyrosine kinase also potential target therapy multiple myeloma . Hematopoietic cell kinase ( Hck ) src family member whose expression restrict hematopoietic cell myeloid B-lymphoid lineage . Hck mediate IL-6 induced proliferative signal , potent growth survival factor multiple myeloma.16 Lyn Fyn two additional src family protein-tyrosine kinase may serve target therapy myeloma . Lyn strongly express myeloma cell line , Fyn expression variable . Activation Lyn Fyn appear requisite IL-6-induced proliferation.17 Selective inhibition Lyn vitro suppress IL-6 induced proliferation.18 Dasatinib high affinity Fyn Lyn , inhibition may reduce IL-6 induced proliferation.13 The receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit overexpressed one-third case multiple myeloma . 19 Inhibition c-kit imatinib result inhibition proliferation vitro.20 Unfortunately , phase II clinical study imatinib relapsed/refractory myeloma , responses.21 However , dasatinib bind c-kit great avidity imatinib.13 Myeloma cell heterogeneous biological characteristic , proliferative response IL-6 , well immunophenotypes , include CD45 expression . The promiscuous nature kinase inhibition dasatinib may tolerate small change kinase remain able inhibit mutant kinase . In addition potential antimyeloma effect dasatinib , potentially additional benefit . Src play essential role osteoclast function bone resorption.22 As Src inhibitor , dasatinib inhibits bone resorption vitro . 11 Src inhibition dasatinib patient multiple myeloma could produce beneficial effect bone density . We propose single-arm , phase II , open-label study dasatinib patient relapse plateau-phase multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Multiple myeloma diagnose standard criterion either relapsed plateauphase disease . Relapsed : At least 1 prior therapy multiple myeloma document evidence progression recent treatment . Plateauphase : subject myeloma response recent multiple myeloma therapy ( include autologous transplantation investigational agent ) residual detectable monoclonal protein serum urine stable great equal 3 month ( +/ 25 % change Mprotein ) . Measurable level monoclonal protein serum ( great equal 0.5 g/dL ) urine ( great equal 1.0 g/24 hr ) . Age 18 year old . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Acceptable organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin great equal 8 gm/dL Absolute neutrophil count great equal 500/mm3 Platelets great equal 50,000/mm3 PT PTT less equal 1.5 time institutional Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 time institutional ULN institutional ULN Hepatic enzyme ( AST , ALT ) equal 2.5 time institutional ULN Serum Na , K+ , Mg2+ , Phosphate Ca2+ great equal Lower Limit Normal ( LLN ) Serum Creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability take oral medication ( dasatinib must swallow whole ) Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( sensitivity less equal 25IU HCG/L ) within 72 hour prior start study drug administration Persons reproductive potential must agree use adequate method contraception throughout treatment least 4 week study drug stop . Signed write informed consent include HIPAA accord institutional guideline . Exclusion Criteria Receiving follow therapy medication : Any investigational agent within 30 day . Drugs generally accept risk cause Torsade de Pointes include : quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide amiodarone , sotalol , ibutilide , dofetilide erythromycin , clarithromycin chlorpromazine , haloperidol , mesoridazine , thioridazine , pimozide cisapride , bepridil , droperidol , methadone , arsenic , chloroquine , domperidone , halofantrine , levomethadyl , pentamidine , sparfloxacin , lidoflazine Subjects discontinue medication must washout period least 7 day prior first dose dasatinib . Medications know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( See Appendix D ) . The concomitant use H2 blocker proton pump inhibitor dasatinib recommend . The use antacid consider place H2 blocker proton pump inhibitor patient receive dasatinib therapy ( See section 5.5.2.3 important caution regard use antacid . ) Patient agree discontinue St. Johns Wort receive dasatinib therapy . Patient agree IV bisphosphonates withhold first 8 week dasatinib therapy due risk hypocalcemia . Prior therapy dasatinib Biopsy proven amyloidosis . History malignancy ( except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix breast ) require radiotherapy systemic treatment within past 5 year . Concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity , include : Pleural pericardial effusion grade Clinicallysignificant coagulation platelet function disorder ( e.g . know von Willebrand 's disease ) Cardiac Symptoms Cardiovascular Disease , include : Myocardial infarction within 6 month Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Congestive heart failure within 6 month Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsade de Pointes ) . Any subject history arrhythmia discuss Investigator prior entry study . Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( great 450 msec ) Bazett 's correction . However , Bazett 's correction high ( i.e. , great 450 msec ) Fridericia le equal 450 msec , subject eligible . Subjects hypokalemia hypomagnesemia correct Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include : Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand 's disease ) Diagnosed acquire bleed disorder within one year ( e.g. , acquire antifactor VIII antibody ) Ongoing recent ( less equal 3 month ) significant gastrointestinal bleeding Women : unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 4 week cessation study drug , positive pregnancy test baseline , breastfeed . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious ) illness Sexually active woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test prior first receive dasatinib . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive dasatinib must enrol study .</criteria>
