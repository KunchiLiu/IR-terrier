	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change may occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study gene expression predict treatment response patient receive gemcitabine S-1 locally advance unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Correlate intratumoral expression level ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 ( RRM1 ) response gemcitabine hydrochloride therapy patient locally advance unresectable metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . Secondary - Correlate intratumoral expression level gene ( e.g. , deoxycytidine kinase [ dCK ] , equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 [ ENT1 ] , concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 3 [ CNT1 CNT3 ] ) response patient . - Determine , preliminarily , median survival patient , use therapeutic strategy entail sequential addition agent decision make base early CA 19-9 biomarker response . - Determine safety approach . - Determine percentage patient classify potential biomarker responder . - Determine time progression successive line treatment . - Determine proportion patient ≥ 25 % decline CA 19-9 biomarker ( i.e. , biomarker response ) successive line treatment . Tertiary - Identify gene may mediate sensitivity gemcitabine hydrochloride , S-1 , agents activity pancreatic cancer . - Determine frequency host genetic polymorphism various nucleoside transporter . OUTLINE : This multicenter . - Initial treatment ( gemcitabine hydrochloride alone ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . CA 19-9 level assess week 1 3 course . Patients biomarker responder continue receive treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride alone . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients longer biomarker responder show evidence disease progression proceed therapy comprise gemcitabine hydrochloride S1 . - Gemcitabine hydrochloride S-1 treatment : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 15 oral S-1 twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo core needle tumor biopsy fine-needle aspiration baseline . Tissue sample analyze correlation transcript protein expression immunohistochemistry expression gene gene product may mediate sensitivity gemcitabine hydrochloride ( RRM1 , ENT1 , CNT1 3 , dCK ) ; S-1 , thymidine phosphorylase [ TP ] , TS , DPD , ORPT ; anticancer treatment ( ERCC-1 , epidermal growth factor receptor , GSK-3β ) reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . Tissue sample also analyze microarray comparative genomic hybridization identify new gene may predict chemotherapeutic response mediate sensitivity anticancer therapy . Mutational status KRAS p53 gene also assess . Blood sample collect baseline analyze genotyping assay identify polymorphic variant select gene . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Adenocarcinoma pancreas already histologically cytologically proven . Patients must either locally advanced ( unresectable ) metastatic disease . Radiographically measurable disease require . No prior therapy advance pancreatic cancer . Treatment give adjuvant setting ( radiation and/or chemotherapy , give either concurrently systemically ) count prior therapy long progressive disease occur &gt; 6 month follow completion treatment . Greater equal 18 year age . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( See Appendix D ) . Laboratory criterion : ANC &gt; 1500/µL Platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( may transfuse receive epoetin alfa maintain exceed level ) INR &lt; 1.5 ( except subject receive fulldose warfarin Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST ALT &lt; 5 time upper limit normal subject document liver metastasis ; &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal subject without evidence liver metastasis Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Serum CA199 &gt; 2X upper limit normal . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Women men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method treatment 6 month afterwards . Exclusion criterion Inability comply study and/or followup procedure Disease determine amenable biopsy upon review radiographs oncologist and/or interventional radiologist . Clearly resectable disease patient appropriate operative candidate . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication Prior systemic therapy advance pancreatic cancer Pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) lactating Use antineoplastic antitumor agent part study therapy , include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , hormonal anticancer therapy , permit participate study . Use concurrent investigational agent permit . S1 Specific Exclusion Criteria Is receive concomitant treatment drug interact S1 . The following drug prohibit may interaction S1 : Sorivudine , brivudine , uracil , dipyridamole , cimetidine , folinic acid ( may enhance S1 activity ) . Allopurinol ( may diminish S1 activity ) . Phenytoin ( S1 may enhance phenytoin activity ) . Flucytosine , fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent ( may enhance S1 flucytosine activity ) . Pilocarpine ( may inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme 2A6 activity ) .</criteria>
