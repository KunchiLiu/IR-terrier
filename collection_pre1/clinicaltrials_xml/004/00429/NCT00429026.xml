	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To compare overall survival metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patient undergo HLA-matched related donor nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( NST ) use fludarabine-melphalan ( FM ) versus fludarabine-cyclophosphamide ( FC ) condition regimen . 2 . To assess cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity antibodies activity potential tumor antigenic peptide involve graft-versus-RCC effect . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To study patient characteristic metastatic RCC patient undergo NST undergo NST . 2 . To compare incidence Day-100 treatment-related mortality FM group FC group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Registration : When willing undergo stem cell transplantation kidney cancer , possible related donor , study doctor decide eligible participate , enrol study . Before treatment begin , complete physical exam , include blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine test . An electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical function heart ) heart scan do . A test lung function do . This involve blow machine record lung capacity . Tissue type also do blood test possible donor find donor . Women able child must negative blood test order participate . If suitable related donor , financial approval transplant procedure , still eligible study , go stem cell transplantation . A separate inform consent transplant procedure provide . You need sign agree second inform consent start treatment . This informed consent enrol registered study . If suitable related donor , financial approval transplant procedure , and/or refuse undergo transplant non-medical reason , stem cell transplant still remain study . You receive form non-transplant treatment physician . Study researcher follow progress , future , compare progress stem cell transplant . This investigational study . About 480 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson Cancer Center . Treatment : The two different chemotherapy regimen use study fludarabine melphalan , fludarabine cyclophosphamide . They act suppress immune system make space bone marrow prepare new bone marrow grow . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine test . An electrocardiogram ( ECG-a test measure electrical activity heart ) heart scan do . A test lung function do . This involve blow machine record lung capacity . Tests perform look status cancer , include chest x-ray , bone scan , CT scan , MRI scan need . You dental exam . Women able bear child must negative blood pregnancy test order participate . In study , receive high-dose chemotherapy prepare blood stem cell transplant . Two different type chemotherapy use . You assign receive one chemotherapy treatment . As study move forward , group treatment show effective receive new participant one . The first chemotherapy treatment combination fludarabine melphalan . The second chemotherapy treatment combination fludarabine cyclophosphamide . The drug fludarabine give needle vein Days 1-5 . Depending treatment group assign , drug melphalan cyclophosphamide give needle vein Days 4 5 , along schedule dose fludarabine . Day 6 rest day ; drug give . The stem cell transplant perform Day 7 . Bone marrow donor may use instead blood stem cell , collection blood stem cell enough . A catheter ( tube ) place large vein chest decrease number time stuck needle . Blood stem cell collect family member , use G-CSF prepare transplant . They need enough stem cell transplantation . The drug tacrolimus methotrexate give ease side effect transplant . Tacrolimus give vein mouth 2 3 month transplant . During last month give , dose decrease gradually . Methotrexate give vein Days 1 , 3 , 6 transplant . An extra dose methotrexate give Day 11 , donor parent child . Blood transfusion may need also . Sometimes , transplant cell attack normal cell body instead cancer cell . This call graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . The drug methylprednisolone give vein mouth fight GVHD happens . You must stay hospital 3 4 week . You must stay Houston area 100 day transplant . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) do every day hospital . Chest x-rays , CT scan , bone scan do month 100 day , every 3 month first year , researcher follow disease response . If sign disease 100 day , treatment stop . You must return clinic checkup every 3 month first year , 3 time year next 4 year , year . If disease still present 2 month , GVHD , anti-rejection medicine tacrolimus stop within 2 week . Then disease still present another 6 week , GVHD , may receive injection donor lymphocytes vein . This treatment may repeat 3 time , 6 week time . If disease find GVHD occurs , treatment stop . This investigational study . About 80 participant enrol study take part stem cell transplant . All enrol M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
