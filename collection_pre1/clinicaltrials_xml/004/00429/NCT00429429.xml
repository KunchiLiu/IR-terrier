	<brief_summary>Currently , food allergy diagnose , `` standard care '' strict avoidance allergic food ready access self-injectable epinephrine . Yet , accidental ingestion occur . Unfortunately , ubiquitous food peanut , possibility inadvertent ingestion great . It estimate 50 % individual allergic peanut accidental reaction peanut 2-year period . The purpose study determine peanut sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) reduce number and/or symptom accidental peanut ingestion peanut allergic subject . We would anticipate subject peanut SLIT protocol would experience adverse effect accidental peanut ingestion course two year SLIT . The primary endpoint evaluate effectiveness SLIT negative DBPCFC peanut ( 8 gram ) completion two year study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy one serious immediate hypersensitivity reaction food term persistence severity reaction appear grow problem . Allergen-specific immunotherapy ( IT ) currently examine treatment option persistence hypersensitivity reaction lack effective treatment . An understanding molecular mechanism peanut-specific IT vital ensure eventual , successful treatment peanut-allergic patient . The goal proposal develop peanut immunotherapy ( IT ) patient peanut allergic reaction . This innovative application design utilize extensive knowledge allergen involve peanut hypersensitivity devise immunotherapeutic approach would lower risk anaphylactic reaction would regulate peanut-specific T cell peanut-allergic patient . Previous attempt utilize peanut-specific immunotherapy unsuccessful primarily severe side effect therapy . The specific aim study desensitize/tolerize peanut-allergic subject peanut allergen-specific , sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) begin determine molecular mechanism peanut-specific T-cell response SLIT . The hypothesis peanut SLIT desensitize patient peanut allergic reaction induction peanut specific regulatory T cell result immune modulation peanut allergic reaction .</detailed_description>
