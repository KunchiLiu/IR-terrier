	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine pre-treating donor lymphocytes investigational drug know L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester ( LLME , prior donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) improve recovery immune system follow stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Accelerate Immune System Recovery Following Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree participate research study evaluate 4th-6th week transplant determine number CD4 cell circulation determine body eliminate immune suppressing medicine use around time transplant . This perform study cell two tube blood . Thereafter , blood cell obtain donor ( donor use transplant ) . These cell donor treat LLME laboratory . The cell wash eliminate LLME , count , desire number administer transfusion . Four six week later , additional blood drawn ( 2-3 teaspoon ) determine number CD4 cell blood . If number 100 , give another transfusion LLME treat cell , receive large number cell . Above 100 CD4 cell , risk infection appear decrease . This repeat every 8 week provide donor remain willing continue one three thing happen . The three thing would cause u stop DLI would : ( 1 ) develop CD4 count 100 , ( 2 ) develop evidence GVHD , ( 3 ) reach maximum practical number cell donor could provide . Your donor also reevaluate medical history , physical examination , blood test ensure he/she remain healthy undergo cell donation procedure safely . He donate first dos white cell draw small amount blood . Later donation , necessary , collect manner similar platelet normally collect volunteer donor blood bank . The manner transfusion give similar receive red blood cell platelet transfusion past .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>To treat study , patient must recently undergo Tcell deplete allogeneic bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant HLAmatched sibling donor , HLA match unrelated donor , HLA partially match ( single antigen mismatch , two antigen mismatch , haplodisparate ) donor . Patients counsel sign inform consent study prior transplant . Our intention analyze effectiveness LLME treat DLI ( Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ) intent treat basis . To proceed therapy HSCT , patient must meet selection criterion time first DLI . Additionally , discussion prior transplant help present patient ( donor ) picture propose therapy entirety , rather piecemeal fashion . A patient donor 's unwillingness participate study way affect eligibility transplant therapy center . At time initial DLI therapy , patient must 28 42 day post allogeneic HSCT 28 42 day last dose ATG agent use transplant part graft rejection prophylaxis . They must also meet follow criterion week prior first infusion : Patients must achieve primary engraftment absolute neutrophil count least 1000 per l 3 consecutive day . Patients must CD4+ lymphocyte count le 200 per l. An absolute lymphocyte count le 200 per l take prime facie evidence CD4+ lymphocyte count meet criteria . Patients may exhibit overt hematologic manifestation relapse persistent disease . Evidence recurrent/persistent disease base primarily flow cytometry , cytogenetics , chimerism analysis , molecular study represent ground exclusion . Patients must 16 year age old . There upper age limit study . Patients must pregnant . Patients must document graftversushost disease .</criteria>
