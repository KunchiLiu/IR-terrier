	<brief_title>Comparison Two Medications Aimed Slowing Aortic Root Enlargement Individuals With Marfan Syndrome -- Pediatric Heart Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Marfan syndrome inheritable disorder affect body 's connective tissue . An abnormal protein result connective tissue weak normal . Because connective tissue find throughout body , Marfan syndrome affect many body system , include skeleton , eye , nervous system , skin , lung , heart , blood vessel . Overall , heart blood vessel abnormality lead cause death individual Marfan syndrome . A common blood vessel abnormality associate disease involve aorta , large artery carry blood away heart rest body . The aortic root , portion aorta attach heart , may enlarge tear even rupture . A tear rupture consider life-threatening emergency . Recent study show medication losartan may reduce aortic root growth improve heart function . The purpose study compare effectiveness losartan versus atenolol slow aortic root growth individual Marfan syndrome . This 3-year study enroll individual Marfan syndrome . Participants randomly assign receive either losartan atenolol daily basis . All participant initially receive low dose assign medication . This dose gradually increase every 3 4 week maximum tolerate dose reach . A continuous electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitor heart rate activity 24-hour interval use determine proper dose increase participant . Participants receive maximum tolerate dose remainder study . Study visit occur baseline Months 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 . Each study visit include physical examination , medical history review , ECG , echocardiogram , questionnaire . Additionally , baseline study visit blood collect laboratory testing .</detailed_description>
