	<brief_summary>This study propose determine safety tolerability 2nd generation designer T cell patient gastric cancer.Designer T cell prepare remove white blood cell participant , modify cell recognize tumor antigen ( CEA ) . These modified cell infuse back participant attack kill tumor cells.Eligibility study diagnosis carcinoma stomach failure respond standard curative therapy . Tumors must express CEA demonstrate elevated serum CEA &gt; 10ng/ml measurable radiologically physical exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T cell penetrate virtually every biologic space power dispose normal malignant cell see viral autoimmune disease rare spontaneous remission cancer . However , T cell easily tolerized self tumor antigens `` immune surveilÂ¬lance '' manifestly fail every cancer clinically apparent . It goal study supply specificity affinities patient T cell without regard `` endogenous '' T cell receptor repertoire , direct antibody-defined recognition kill malignant cell base expression antigen . We achieve prepare chimeric IgCD28TCR gene mammalian expression vector yield `` designer T cell '' normal patient cell . Prior study model system demonstrate recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modify T cell respond antigen target IL2 secretion , cellular proliferation , cytotoxicity , hallmark effective , self-sustaining immune response . It therefore become paramount interest extend study human system widespread clinical relevance explore clinical potential new technology . The target antigen study carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , prominently express tumor stomach , colon rectum , breast , pancreas site .</detailed_description>
