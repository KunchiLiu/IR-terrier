	<brief_summary>Breast cancer patient experience functional limitation related cancer treatment side effect . Early functional limitation affect short- long-term quality life , may lead long-term complication . Patients live rural area particular risk easy access service . Therefore , early intervention indicate impact overall public health . Problem solve training ( PST ) standardize manual drive intervention may ideally suit assist breast cancer patient preserve value activity comply recommend symptom management regimen ( e.g. , physical therapy , aerobic exercise relaxation/guided imagery ) improve function . Telephone-based PST provide centralize location ( comprehensive cancer center ) may improve access outcomes cost-effective manner . We propose conduct feasibility study PST intervention 30 rural breast cancer patient undergo adjuvant treatment randomly assign PST usual care . The intervention group receive weekly phone-based PST session six consecutive week . The specific aim R03 small grant application to:1 ) Test feasibility enrol retain newly diagnose breast cancer patient clinical trial ass telephone-based PST . 2 ) Collect preliminary data outcome measure function determine effect size estimate inform power analysis full scale randomize control study . Primary outcome measure acceptance rate enrollment study , retention rate across intervention arm , satisfaction level PST intervention . Assessments conduct baseline , six week ( end PST intervention ) 3 month follow baseline . The long-term goal line investigation develop practical , widely applicable rehabilitation model care preserve function decrease distress cancer patient undergoing treatment .</brief_summary>
