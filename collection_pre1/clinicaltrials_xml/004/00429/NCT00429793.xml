	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Refractory Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) objective tumor response patient refractory recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer treat temsirolimus . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . Secondary I . Determine duration PFS overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 52 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
