	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose dasatinib combination gemcitabine give patient advance solid tumor . The safety combination study drug also study . Researchers also want study pharmacodynamics ( PDs ) study drug combination . PD test use learn effect drug tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Dasatinib Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dasatinib design block several protein show important growth , spreading , survival cancer cell . Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause die prevent growth cancer cell . The amount dasatinib gemcitabine receive depend start study . There 3 participant enrol group . The first group participant enrol study give small dos dasatinib gemcitabine . If intolerable side effect experience , next group participant enrol high dose level . This process continue researcher find high tolerable dose dasatinib gemcitabine give without intolerable side effect occur . Up 15 patient enrolled high tolerable dose expansion group . If enrolled expansion group , biopsy PD test prior first day study . Your doctor tell group enrol . Your study doctor tell dose dasatinib gemcitabine receive compare dose participant receive . While study , dose may increase next high level , next high dose level already test participant find tolerable . You take dasatinib mouth day 7 day row begin receive gemcitabine vein . If intolerable side effect dasatinib occur , continue take rest study . If enrolled expansion group , take dasatinib mouth day 56 day row . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect dasatinib , take study begin take gemcitabine . You receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute start Day 8 . The first cycle 9 week long ( 63 day ) . You receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute week 7 week Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 . On Days 51-63 , receive gemcitabine ( rest period drug ) , continue take dasatinib day . There rest period dasatinib . If enrolled expansion group , receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute start Day 1 . The first cycle 8 week long ( 56 day ) . You receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute week 7 week Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 43 . On Days 44- 56 , receive gemcitabine ( rest period drug ) , continue take dasatinib day . There rest period dasatinib . Cycle 2 cycle equal 28 day . You continue take dasatinib day . You receive gemcitabine week 3 week Days 1 , 8 , 15 . On Days 16-28 , receive gemcitabine , continue take dasatinib day . If experience intolerable side effect , may need additional blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) monitor condition . Your dose level may reduce stop intolerable side effect occur , depend study doctor think best . If disease get bad continue experience intolerable side effect gemcitabine , take study . You blood draw ( 1 teaspoon time ) PD test . In Cycle 1 daily dose dasatinib gemcitabine , PD blood sample draw 1-4 day receive study drug , Day 8 ( day 1st dose gemcitabine give ) end week 4 receive study drug . During Week 4 Cycle 1 end Cycle 1 , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect ( end Cycle 1 ) routine test . You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) feeling . You also ask drug may take intolerable side effect study drug . On Day 1 remain cycle , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test . You performance status evaluation ask feeling . You also ask drug may take intolerable side effect study drug . Once participation end study reason , ask end-of-study visit occur 28 day last dose study drug . At visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You performance status evaluation ask feeling . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You ask drug may take , ask intolerable side effect study drug . Women able child blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . If study-related side effect report end-of-study visit , continue follow-up visit telephone call , ( last 5-10 minute time ) least every 4 week , check still experience side effect long experience . This investigational study . Dasatinib gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study experimental authorize use research . Up 63 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
