	<brief_summary>Development safe effective vaccine leishmaniasis start 10 year ago WHO/TDR supervision . An autoclaved L. major vaccine ( ALM ) mix BCG test human Iran , Pakistan Sudan . Long term follow vaccinee show untoward reaction except skin reaction site injection . The efficacy result ALM satisfactory . In order enhance immunogenicity vaccine , ALM adsorb alum ( Aluminum hydroxide ) . Alum-ALM plus adjuvant show induce protection Rhesus monkey cutaneous leishmaniasis Languor monkey visceral leishmaniasis . Two trial single injection different dose Alum-ALM mixed 1/10th normal dose BCG carry healthy volunteer non endemic area Sudan . The safety/immunogenicity parameters volunteer closely monitor result show side effect minimal confine site injection form mild local pain , induration ulceration , associate BCG vaccination . The immunogenicity result show strong immune response see Leishmania vaccine trial far . It seem new formulation appropriate candidate development . Inoculation live virulent Leishmania produce lesion purpose prevent natural infection know leishmanization . The induced lesion heals person usually protect infection . This method prevention practice century region . In study volunteer response leishmanin inject twice ( 30 day apart ) Alum-ALM 200 ug + 1/10 BCG ( n = 50 ) BCG ( n = 50 ) BCG diluent alone ( n = 50 ) control . All volunteer leishmanized day 60 post vaccination . In trial , volunteer protect either vaccine leishmanization . The leishmanized volunteer visit weekly development heal process lesion monitor complete healing every volunteer . The immune response volunteer evaluate .

	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Trial Killed Leishmania Vaccine Volunteers With Response Leishmanin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Leishmaniases encompass diverse clinical manifestation produce different specie protozoan parasite , Leishmania , transmit bite infected female sand fly . Due diversity epidemiological characteristic , vector reservoir control impractical , costly usually require political environment infrastructure beyond mean country suffer disease . It aim WHO/TDR develop safe effective vaccine , locally produce thereby affordable population poorest develop country . Beginning 1930 's 40 's , Latin American scientist use kill whole parasite vaccine leishmaniasis ( 1 ) . Different form vaccine , without adjuvant prophylaxis therapy study several country past decade ( 2 ) , none efficacious prophylaxis , efficacy observe immuno-chemotherapy ( 3 ) . Over past decade , produce tested different preparation kill L. major plus BCG . The autoclaved L. major ( ALM ) mix BCG ( 1/10th dose normally used vaccine tuberculosis ) study extensively several clinical trial . The ALM + BCG formulation show safe immunogenic ( 4-8 ) . However , result several phase III trial single double-dose candidate vaccine CL VL show significant overall protection compare immunization BCG alone ( 6-8 ) . Even three injection sufficiently protective cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) . In order enhance immunogenicity ALM + BCG , ALM adsorb alum ( Aluminum hydroxide ) , result alum-ALM mixed BCG produce new formulation vaccine . Indeed , addition alum ALM lead enhanced immunogenicity . It demonstrate single injection ALM alum plus IL-12 induced protection Rhesus monkey CL ( 10 ) . Likewise , Alum-ALM + BCG protect Langur monkey visceral leishmaniasis ( 11 ) . The result 2 dose escalate trial single intra-dermal injection Alum-ALM ( 10 - 400 ug Leishmania protein ) mix 1/10th normal dose BCG show high skin test conversion see Leishmania vaccine trial far ( 12 ) . The safety parameter volunteer closely monitor 90 day vaccination local systemic side effect . Side effect minimal confine site injection . No systemic side effect record . In second TDR-sponsored trial Sudan 10 , 100 320 ug protein plus BCG test result confirm immunogenicity alum-ALM+BCG vaccine . Thus , Alum precipitate ALM mix 1/10th BCG appear constitute safe vaccine appropriate candidate development . Leishmanization ( LZ ) : Inoculation live virulent Leishmania produce lesion purpose prevent natural infection - usually result multiple lesion expose part body - know leishmanization ( LZ ) . Generally , recovery CL lead protection future infection ( 14 ) . During last forty year , L. major promastigotes grow cell-free culture use leishmanization Israel ( 15 ) Iran ( 16 ) well high-risk population Uzbekistan ( 17 ) . Massive LZ perform estimate two million people Iran preventive measure Iran-Iraq war 80 's ( 16 ) . However , practice discontinue war due occasional long-lasting lesion difficulty standardize production circumstance immediately follow war . LZ live challenge efficacy trial leishmaniasis candidate vaccine would bring considerable time cost save dramatically reduce follow-up time , logistical demand sample size require ( thereby expose few participant potential risk new candidate vaccine ) . Challenge study LZ would also provide opportunity fully study immunological response sample size far small field efficacy trial ; hence one seek protection correlate could use subsequent vaccine evaluation selection . Although much know immune mechanism experimental leishmaniasis , surrogate marker protective immunity establish human today . It difficult costly search marker field efficacy trial particularly child target at-risk-population . In addition , LZ live challenge candidate vaccine efficacy trial perform endemic focus would serve two purpose : ) evaluate protective efficacy vaccine candidate b ) protect recipient naturally occur CL , usually multiple lesion face expose part body . Hence , participant protect , either candidate vaccine LZ . Preliminary , safety immunogenicity trial LZ : In preliminary study first step develop reproducible challenge system evaluate various vaccine candidate leishmaniasis prior ( possibly instead ) large scale field efficacy trial , frozen live Leishmania major produce Razi Institute ( 5 x 105 promastigotes per inoculation ) use live challenge inoculum ( 19 ) . In clinical trial study safety immunogenicity LZ lesion development result artificial infection , 23 adult male Iranian volunteer select leishmanized ( 19 ) . Lesion evolution volunteer check recorded twice month picture take follow-up visit complete healing . Eighty three percent ( 19/23 ) volunteer develop lesion LZ ( 17/23 within 60 day LZ ) . The large ulcer size 17.5 mm . The long healing period 285 day ( one volunteer ) . No serious adverse reaction relate LZ require medical attention observe report . In second trial , LZ use 20 volunteer , include 14 individual first trial ( 11 previously develop lesion 3 ) . The result demonstrate similarity live challenge natural infection . Indeed , volunteer develop lesion first LZ one cure case natural infection totally immune develop new lesion upon live challenge . All volunteer history CL develop lesion previous trial immune develop lesion . The course lesion development similar observe first LZ trial . This confirm LZ use effectively reproducibly tool evaluate protection induce candidate vaccine . In addition , LZ confers immunity re-infection , candidate vaccine fail ( 19 ) . Subsequent study , TDR-sponsored , single-blind randomize controlled trial designate LZ3 , perform assess safety , immunogenicity efficacy four different dos alum-ALM ( 10,100 , 200 320 ug ALM ) plus 1/10th BCG CL cause leishmanization . The target sample size ( N = 30 arm ) calculate accord 80 % power 0.05 level confidence , 50 % protection LZ , 60 % take rate LZ placebo control group ( take rate = lesion development ulceration ) 10 % loss follow . These assumption base result two previous leishmanization trial ( designate LZ1 LZ2 ) healthy volunteer use live parasite ( stabilate ) , produce 1997 , standardize keep frozen liquid N2 use . The trial initiated 2001 considerable delay . The time assessment efficacy set day 135 184 ( 75 124 day live challenge ) base two previous LZ trial use stabilate . However , due paucity active lesion development , protocol amend assess outcome later date . This trial suffer major difficulty . Most importantly , problem live challenge virulence lead significantly less-than-expected take rate ( 45 % instead expect 80-100 % ) , render decided sample size insufficient vaccine efficacy assessment . However , despite inconclusive efficacy result , trial clearly demonstrate safety different dose alum-ALM+BCG . To evaluate efficacy candidate vaccine properly , decide repeat trial . Risks Potential Benefits : As observe previous trial Sudan Iran , risk associate single injection alum-ALM+BCG limited local reaction range induration ulceration . These lesion due BCG injection use adjuvant tend heal within 30-40 day . Similarly , risk associate LZ , observe LZ1 , LZ2 LZ3 , local lesion heal spontaneously , usually leave scar . As state earlier , LZ method protection seek resident endemic area would otherwise expose high chance natural infection result multiple lesion face , hand expose part body . In clinical trial , LZ would lead protection individual would immune result injection ( ) candidate vaccine . Rationale trial The clinical trial outline protocol propose evaluate safety , immunogenicity efficacy single double intradermal injection 200 ug Alum-precipitated autoclave L. major ( Alum-ALM ) plus BCG vaccine healthy Iranian volunteer , high risk CL due L. major follow leishmanization . A comparator group receive saline lieu candidate vaccine group determine take rate live challenge . Another comparator group receive BCG double-blind manner . Trial Objectives Purpose Primary objective To evaluate safety single- well double injection Alum-ALM ( 200 ug Leishmania protein ) mix 1/10th dose BCG vaccine within 30 day booster injection Iranian volunteer follow live challenge L. major assessment protection . To determine protection induce live challenge double injection Alum-ALM mixed BCG 30 day last vaccination . To determine booster injection Alum-ALM + BCG induce high immunological response measure skin test . Protection define absence ulcerative lesion development ( consistent CL ) Days 180 + 15 leishmanization site LZ . Primary endpoint Occurrence local and/or systemic adverse event ( AEs ) within 30 day vaccination assess interview , physical examination . Percentage volunteer protect CL ( absence lesion ) compare control day 180 + 15 LZ . Dosage regimens Cohort 1 . Double injection ( 30 day apart ) Alum-ALM 200 ug mixed 1/10 normal dose BCG ( n = 50 ) . Cohort 2 . Double injection ( 30 day apart ) 1/10 normal dose BCG ( n = 50 ) . Cohort 3 . Double injection Comparator ( = BCG diluent alone ) control ( n = 50 ) It expect lesion induced vaccination heal day 60 ( day LZ ) . All eligible volunteer receive LZ stabilate day 60 . Volunteers monitor minimum 240 day lesion induced leishmanization completely heal ) .</detailed_description>
