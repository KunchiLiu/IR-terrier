	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether maintenance different oral dos sustain release d-amphetamine ( SR-AMP ) combine constant-dose sublingual buprenorphine ( BUP ) safe well tolerated decrease self-administration cocaine alone combine hydromorphone ( HYD ) . Secondary aim determine whether SR-AMP attenuates subjective physiological effect cocaine drug sample period prior choice opportunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heroin abuser also frequently abuse cocaine , concurrent use drug associate severe drug dependence associate psychiatric medical problem , great risk HIV infection , bad drug abuse treatment outcome , create public health burden . New method solution need problem . While human laboratory model exist study choice cocaine opioids individually , study examine choice cocaine alone cocaine/opioid combination heroin dependent individual , intervention reduce drug use . We recently develop sensitive laboratory-based choice progressive ratio procedure study drug-seeking behavior opioids . This study extend procedure , form drug combination vs. money choice , obtain novel human laboratory model cocaine/opioid abuse . The purpose study determine whether maintenance different dos sustain release d-amphetamine ( SR-AMP ) combine constant-dose buprenorphine ( BUP ) safe well tolerated decrease self-administration cocaine alone combine HYD . Secondary aim determine whether SR-AMP attenuates subjective physiological effect cocaine drug sample period prior choice opportunity . One goal new study develop human laboratory model polydrug abuse allow participant ( abuse heroin cocaine ) choose drug combination money . The second goal study develop medication treatment reduce cocaine use opioid dependent individual . Participants observational study take part multiple trial opportunity choose drug combination ( cocaine alone combined HYD ; relative HYD alone dual placebo ) money . On morning session , prior choice procedure , participant receive sample drug dose choose . Participants ask attend effect produce drug combination able choose relative money choice task afternoon session . During choice procedure , participant 12 opportunity choose either drug money . Participants use computer earn choice . Respiration rate , oxygen saturation , heart rate , blood pressure monitor throughout study . Self-report questionnaire complete different time study . Participants maintain constant dose BUP throughout study , minimum 2-week lead experiment , fix 3-week detoxification study completion . During experiment maintain different dos SR-AMP constant dose BUP .</detailed_description>
