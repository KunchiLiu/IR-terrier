	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance feature number clinical disorder , include type 2 diabetes/glucose intolerance , obesity , dyslipidaemia hypertension cluster so-called metabolic syndrome.The prevalence metabolic syndrome , defined 2001 ATP III criterion , 22 percent , age-dependent increase.Data demonstrate prevalence continue increase , particularly women.Hyperinsulinemia occur response insulin resistance may play important role genesis metabolic syndrome . Prevention reduction obesity , particularly abdominal obesity , main therapeutic goal patient metabolic syndrome .Weight reduction optimally achieve multimodality approach include diet , exercise , possible pharmacologic therapy , orlistat .It show many different diet Mediterranean diet , DASH diet , Foods low glycemic index low saturate fat diet , independent weight loss , reduce insulin resistance may effective improve metabolic syndrome .During month Ramadan ( The ninth month Islamic calendar ) , Muslims fast every day dawn sunset . They refrain drink eat 12h interval . There currently report effect Ramadan fasting ( two meal per day ) metabolic syndrome . Therefore , study conduct assess insulin resistance index subject undergoing type fast thirty day period .</detailed_description>
