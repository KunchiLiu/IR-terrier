	<brief_summary>Development safe effective vaccine leishmaniasis start 10 year ago WHO/TDR supervision . An autoclaved L. major vaccine ( ALM ) mix BCG test human Iran , Pakistan Sudan . Long term follow vaccinee show untoward reaction except skin reaction site injection . The efficacy result ALM satisfactory . In order enhance immunogenicity vaccine , ALM adsorb alum ( Aluminum hydroxide ) . Alum-ALM plus adjuvant show induce protection Rhesus monkey cutaneous leishmaniasis Languor monkey visceral leishmaniasis . Two trial single injection different dose Alum-ALM mixed 1/10th normal dose BCG carry healthy volunteer non endemic area Sudan . The safety/immunogenicity parameters volunteer closely monitor result show side effect minimal confine site injection form mild local pain , induration ulceration , associate BCG vaccination . The immunogenicity result show strong immune response see Leishmania vaccine trial far . It seem new formulation appropriate candidate development . Inoculation live virulent Leishmania produce lesion purpose prevent natural infection know leishmanization . The induced lesion heals person usually protect infection . This method prevention practice century region . In study volunteer response leishmanin inject twice ( 30 day apart ) Alum-ALM 200 ug + 1/10 BCG ( n = 50 ) diluent alone ( n = 50 ) control . All volunteer leishmanized day 60 post vaccination . In trial , volunteer protect either vaccine leishmanization . The leishmanized volunteer visit weekly development heal process lesion monitor complete healing every volunteer . The immune response volunteer evaluate . Vaccine efficacy define percent reduction number volunteer develop lesion follow leishmanization compare control day 240 .</brief_summary>
