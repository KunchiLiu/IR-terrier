	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop way treat patient completely match family donor readily available unrelated donor bone marrow transplant use partially-matched family donor . Patients receive type transplant receive chemotherapy and/or radiation treat disease . They also receive donor 's cell 2 part . During first part , donor 's lymphocyte expose one chemotherapy agent help patient become tolerant lymphocyte . In second part transplant , patient receive donor 's stem cell help recover peripheral blood count establish long-term engraftment . The hypothesis study partially-matched allogeneic transplant , define number donor T-cells treat give recipient avoid post-transplant infection without cause severe graft-versus-host disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two-Step Approach Bone Marrow Transplant Using Cells From A Partially-Matched Relative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant life-saving therapy patient without well match donor . This type therapy associate poor outcome past due complication infection . The Jefferson 2 Step approach design allow infusion exact dose tolerized lymphocyte haploidentical transplant order allow immune reconstitution post transplant avoid infectious complication still acceptable rate GVHD . In approach , patient high-risk hematological malignancy undergo 8 fraction TBI ( 12 Gy ) follow exact dose donor lymphocyte . The phase I portion study determine optimal dose lymphocyte . Two day receive donor lymphocyte , patient receive 2 daily dos cyclophosphamide . One day receive cyclophosphamide , patient receive stem cell donor . Tacrolimus mycophenylate mofetil use GVHD prophylaxis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any patient hematologic oncologic diagnosis allogeneic HSCT think beneficial , frontline therapy already apply . 2 . Patients must relate donor either one , two three six antigen mismatch HLAA ; B ; DR locus . 3 . Patients without wellmatched unrelated donor disease status preclude wait identify unrelated donor . 4 . Patients must adequate organ function : LVEF &gt; 45 % FVC FEV1 &gt; 45 % predicted Adequate liver function define serum bilirubin &lt; 1.8 , AST ALT &lt; 2.5X upper limit normal Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min 5 . Performance status &gt; 60 % ( Karnofsky ) 6 . Patients must willing use contraception childbearing potential 7 . Able give inform consent 1 . An eligible HLAidentical sibling donor . 2 . Performance status &lt; 60 % ( Karnosfsky ) 3 . HIV positive 4 . Active involvement central nervous system malignancy 5 . Psychiatric disorder would preclude patient sign informed consent 6 . Pregnancy 7 . Patients life expectancy &lt; 6 month reason underlie hematologic/oncologic disorder .</criteria>
