	<brief_title>Non-invasive Ventilation Versus Sham Ventilation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) show randomise control trial improve arterial blood gas , reduce intubation mortality rate patient suffer exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) complicate acute hypercapnic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) [ 1-7 ] . Despite success NIV AHRF COPD , survivor group patient might suffer episode AHRF discharge . It find recent study COPD patient survive AHRF treatment acute NIV high risk readmission life-threatening event ensue year [ 8 ] . At one year discharge , 80 % readmitted respiratory diagnosis , 63 % another life-threatening event 49 % die , mainly due respiratory failure . Survivors spend median 12 % time hospitalize subsequent year . A significant proportion survivor require repeat NIV recurrent AHRF . Another study show COPD patient decline intubation AHRF treat acute NIV , outcomes even bad , 1-year survival 30 % [ 9 ] . It become imperative find way reduce occurrence life-threatening event survivor . There uncontrolled data suggest home NIV might reduce hospital admission clinic visit severe COPD hypercapnic respiratory failure . In 11 severe stable COPD patient chronic hypercapnia respond conventional treatment , Jones et al put home NIV [ 10 ] . Hospital admission clinic visit halve subsequent year , together sustain improvement arterial blood gas . Cost save demonstrate home NIV severe COPD another study [ 11 ] . However , result randomize controlled study ( RCTs ) conflicting . Three early study suggest home NIV superior standard treatment stable severe COPD [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] . On hand , Meecham-Jones et al find NIV long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) significantly improve daytime blood gas , nocturnal gas exchange sleep quality severe COPD [ 15 ] . A long-term RCT home NIV severe COPD show home NIV significantly reduce dyspnoea rating , improve psychomotor coordination decrease hospital admission 3 month , though reduction hospital admission longer evident 12 month [ 16 ] . However , randomized study criticize include chronic stable COPD patient hypercapnic enough benefit home NIV , use inadequate inflation pressure , inadequate patient acclimatization time select optimal outcome variable [ 17 ] . In recent RCT [ 18 ] , home NIV LTOT show significantly improve gas exchange , dyspnoea score quality life ; also trend reduce hospital ICU admission . However , study power detect improvement daytime PaCO2 NIV group . We hypothesize continuation NIV home episode AHRF treat NIV COPD patient would reduce likelihood death recurrent AHRF require NIV intubation . We design study way recruit COPD patient would start home NIV sham treatment episode AHRF require acute NIV . The patient acclimatise NIV application day acute use . We choose occurrence life-threatening event ( recurrent AHRF death ) primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
