	<brief_summary>Every year 4 billion case diarrhea occur worldwide culminate 2.5 million death , almost develop nation . Reliable diagnosis patient acute infectious diarrhea could appropriately manage antibiotic presentation still remain formidable challenge clinician . To address issue predict microbiological infectious etiology diagnose acute infectious diarrhea , would evaluate stools patient acute diarrhea culture , Guaiac base fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) , Calprotectin lactoferrin assay simultaneously . This would first study evaluate fecal calprotectin diagnostic marker acute diarrhea</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Calprotectin : Cheap Marker Diagnosing Acute Infectious Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 4 billion case diarrhea worldwide i.e . half population world affect every year . Though mortality reduce significantly still contribute 2.2 million death ( 4 % death ) 5 % health loss due disability annually . Most death due acute diarrhea , develop country rapidly cause dehydration unless adequately supplement . Unlike many medical challenge , acute infectious diarrhea still remain significant global health hazard . Adequate , appropriate treatment proper antimicrobial shorten morbidity , hospitalisation cost society also life save certain infectious diarrhea . The big problem lack accurate diagnostic modality differentiate acute infection non infectious diarrhea . Stool microscopy , Guaiac base fecal blood test ( hemoccult ) , lactoferrin assay bacteriological culture use purpose till . However none great help diagnostic algorithm management acute diarrhea . The gold standard diagnose acute infectious diarrhea course bacteriological culture . But expensive , time consume delay definite therapy . There need something simple , cheap , fast accurate diagnose acute infectious diarrhea . In present prospective study , plan evaluate performance characteristic fecal calprotectin diverse group patient refer hospital . Its performance characteristic would compare lactoferrin FOBT .</detailed_description>
