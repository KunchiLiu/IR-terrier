	<brief_summary>The purpose study find part brain increase decreased activity people depress antidepressant medicine change activity depress patients.In particular , study investigate whether variation serotonin transporter gene affect response escitalopram measure clinical interview MRI scan . We measure activity different part brain , subject see picture , use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan . There three MRI scan ; one start medication , one study 3 week treatment one six week treatment . Treatment consist Escitalopram . Additionally blood sample take genetic testing . The genetic sample collect look variation gene ( serotonin transporter gene ) , affect function chemical serotonin brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serotonin Transporter Genetic Variation Amygdalar Activation Correlates Antidepressant Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : Depressed patient s/s s/L allele 5-HTTLPR polymorphism great amygdalar activation decrease cortico-amygdala connectivity compare patient L/L genotype Hypothesis 2 : After 2 8 week treatment escitalopram ( 10 mg ) depress patient L/L allele great decrease amygdalar activation great increase cortico-amygdala connectivity patient s/s s/L genotype . Methods : We stratify subject two genotype group comparable term age gender distribution . Only depressed patient treat escitalopram . Healthy subject unmedicated currently euthymic depressed patient baseline scan subsequent repeat fMRI scan interval depress patient receive treatment . After complete first fMRI scan , depress patient undergto one week single blind placebo lead . After first week patient 's depression symptom assess . If depression symptom much well first week ( &gt; 20 % reduction HAM-D score ) patient ask rest study refer clinician choice treatment necessary . If depression symptom show much improvement first week ask take escitalopram next 8 week . At end 3 week treatment baseline , patient undergo second fMRI scan . Following second fMRI scan patient continue escitalopram another 6 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Depressed Subjects 1 . Ages 1845 year able give voluntary inform consent . 2 . Satisfy criterion Major Depression use Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV ( SCIDIV ) . 3 . 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score &gt; 18 4 . Satisfy criterion undergo MRI scan base MRI screen questionnaire 5 . Able manage outpatient initial assessment treatment ascertain follow 6 . Symptoms worsen 5 point either HDRS course study . 7 . No danger self others . 8 . No psychotic symptom . 9 . If genetically patient match/meets requirement study . The ratio genotype l/l genotype 3:2 . Therefore , stage study may one type genotype may able include patient whose genotype already sufficient number subject . Inclusion criterion healthy subject : 1 . Ages 1860 year able give voluntary inform consent . 2 . No history psychiatric illness substance abuse dependence assess SCID nonpatients ( SCIDNP ) . 3 .

No serious medical neurological illness assess history , physical examination laboratory examination include CBC blood chemistry . 6 . If genetically subject match/meets requirement study . The ratio genotype l/l genotype 4:1 . Therefore , stage study may one type genotype may able include patient whose genotype already sufficient number subject . Exclusion criteria patient 1 .
