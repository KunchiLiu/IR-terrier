	<brief_title>Study Safety Effectiveness DIAM™ Spinal Stabilization System Versus Conservative Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pivotal clinical trial conduct evaluate DIAM™ Spinal Stabilization System treatment single-level moderate lumbar degenerative disc disease . The implant investigation clinical trial DIAM Spinal Stabilization System , device implant use posterior surgical approach . Patients control group receive nonoperative treatment .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Each patient participate clinical trial must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Has moderate low back pain secondary lumbar degenerative disc disease single level L2 L5 . Low back pain define persistent back pain , without radicular pain , current episode less one year duration . Degenerative disc disease confirm patient history , physical examination , radiographic study one follow factor ( measure radiographically MRI scan xrays ) : Decreased disc height &gt; 2mm , compare disc space next adjacent ( superior inferior , whichever great disc height ) spinal level ; Scarring/thickening ligamentum flavum , annulus fibrosis , facet joint capsule ; Herniated nucleus pulposus . 2 .
