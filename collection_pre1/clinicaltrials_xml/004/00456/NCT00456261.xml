	<brief_title>First-Line Treatment A Comparison 2 Treatments Elderly Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients study assign one 2 treatment group . The selection treatment group do randomly computer . The first group , Cohort A , receive bevacizumab 10mg/kg vein 30-90 minute follow pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 vein 10 minute follow gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2 vein 30-60 minute . This regimen give day 1 day 15 treatment cycle . Each cycle 28 day long . As long disease worsen patient receive maximum 6 cycle combination chemotherapy . Following receive bevacizumab alone every 2 week long disease worsen . The second group , Cohort B , receive bevacizumab 15mg/kg vein 30-90 minute follow pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 vein approximately 10 minute follow carboplatin AUC=5 vein 30-60 minute . This regimen give day 1 treatment cycle . Each cycle 21 day long . As long disease worsen patient receive maximum 6 cycle combination chemotherapy . Following receive bevacizumab alone every 3 week long disease worsen . In regimen vitamin B12 injection Folic Acid pill give reduce occurrence side effect treatment . Each patient 's disease evaluate interval proper scan X-rays see well cancer respond treatment .</detailed_description>
