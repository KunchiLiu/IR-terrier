	<brief_summary>This clinical research study do effective treatment advance androgen-independent prostate cancer . This study determine combination medication ( Taxotere Doxil ) effective kind cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Taxotere Doxil Treat Advanced Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each cycle treatment consist four week . The 2 type medicine give intravenously ( vein ) . Doxil give first day cycle . Taxotere give week first 3 week cycle . This follow week rest next cycle start . Treatment give outpatient basis hospitalization anticipate . Prior entry study , `` screening '' test perform determine eligibility participate . This involve complete history physical examination , vital sign , pain assessment , blood test include CBC ( complete blood count ) , serum chemistry , PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) , x-rays ( chest x-ray , possible plain film bone abnormal finding bone scan clarification ) , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen pelvis , bone scan , MUGA scan 2-D echocardiogram , quality life questionnaire . After treatment start follow test do regularly monitor beneficial toxic effect treatment : Every week : blood test . Every month : physical examination , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , respiration , temperature heart rate ) PSA test . Every 2 month : pain assessment , quality life questionnaire , x-rays ( chest x-ray possible pain film bone positive finding see bone scan ) , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan ( abdomen pelvis ) bone scan . Participants may continue procedure part regular cancer care . It anticipate participant study minimum 2 month long benefiting treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Androgenindependent disease progression , show : A castrate testosterone level &lt; 40 ng/dl ( measurement require patient treat medical testicular suppression ) . If testicular suppression achieve medically , treatment maintain castrate level testosterone must apply continuously . A PSA level least 4 ng/ml , rise ( absolute change least 1 ng/ml ) two consecutive measurement least 2 week apart prior study entry . Patients must antiandrogens flutamide ( Eulexin ) nilutamide ( Nilandron ) least four week , six week bicalutamide ( Casodex ) , without evidence response ; evidence progression since antiandrogen withdrawal . None one previous cytotoxic therapy allow . ( For study , combination agent give period time consider one chemotherapy treatment ) Age &gt; 18 year age . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 50 % ; see Appendix B ) . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/ul platelet &gt; 100,000/ul hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl Patients must adequate liver function define : total bilirubin normal , albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dl , ascites AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) Alkaline Phosphatase must within range allow eligibility Patients must adequate renal function define creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min ( measure estimate Cockroft formula ) patient creatinine level 2.5 mg/dl Patients must recover acute toxicity chemotherapy radiotherapy administer prior enter study . Alopecia may resolve peripheral neuropathy ( grade 1 ) may present . Patients must MUGA scan 2d echocardiogram indicate ejection fraction &gt; 50 % within 42 day prior first dose study drug . The method use baseline must use later monitoring . Patients reproductive potential must use adequate contraceptive method ( e.g. , abstinence , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , barrier device spermicide surgical sterilization ) treatment three month complete treatment . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients two prior chemotherapy treatment ( ) ( For study , combination agent give period time consider one chemotherapy treatment ) . Patients receive investigational agent ( ) . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis actively receive therapy brain metastasis ( poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event ) . Active second malignancy last 5 year except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinomainsitu . History cardiac disease , New York Heart Association Class II great , clinical evidence congestive heart failure . History hypersensitivity reaction attribute conventional formulation doxorubicin HCL , component Doxil , docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
