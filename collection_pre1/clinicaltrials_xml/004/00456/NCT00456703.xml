	<brief_title>Restricted Fluid Regimen Open Abdominal Bowel Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective control trial patient ( ASA I-III ) undergo open abdominal surgical procedure single center . This study do two phase . The first phase design evaluate prove safety restrict fluid regimen maintain tissue perfusion use central venous oximetric catheter arterial blood gas analysis . In second phase study , plan mimic usual clinical practice without central venous oximetric catheter arterial line ( invasive monitor ) postoperative total morbidity compare liberal restrict fluid regimen . In first phase study , 90 patient come open bowel surgery randomize three group use random number generator . All patient receive standard bowel prep regimen ( Go-Lyte-half liter night surgery ) . Group A receive current standard care ( liberal fluid therapy ) , Group B C receive restrict fluid regimen . All patient receive 500 cc intravenous fluid ( lactated ringer Group A B , 6 % hetastarch Group C ) preoperative hold area correct preoperative fluid deficit due fast bowel preparation . Patients young 18 year , ASA IV V , pregnant patient , coagulopathy , renal insufficiency , unstable angina , unstable congestive heart failure , contraindication central venous pressure catheter insertion exclude study . After institute anesthesia monitor , patient anesthetized standard anesthetic regimen . An arterial line central venous catheter oximetric capability insert three group . A baseline blood gas drawn note base excess , lactate level hematocrit start surgery . Parameters like heart rate , blood pressure , central venous pressure , mixed venous oxygen saturation arterial oxygen saturation urine output continuously monitor . Both regimen start operate room continue postoperative period resume oral intake . Patients liberal group receive ( 10ml/kg/hr ) current standard care bowel surgery whereas restrict group receive 4ml/kg/hour . Post induction hemodynamic instability treat ephedrine phenylephrine discretion anesthesiologist charge . Intraoperative treatment tachycardia , hypotension group treat use standard fluid regimen algorithm ( appendix A ) . All patient receive postoperative fluid regimens current standard care . Postoperative morbidity evaluation ( appendix B ) do patient 's discharge hospital . The data entry prospectively do hospital stay . The accuracy data check one study investigator .</detailed_description>
