	<detailed_description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) common hereditary kidney disease , affect 1 400 1000 individual account 4 % end-stage renal disease United States 8-10 % Europe . The condition characterize progressive development kidney cyst kidney enlargement associate loss kidney function . High blood pressure cardiovascular disease common patient ADPKD . Although condition often think affect primarily adult , clear disease present fetus young child . This study design determine treatment medicine pravastatin slow progression kidney heart disease initiate early life patient ADPKD . We assess difference pravastatin placebo study group three-year study period respect : 1 ) total kidney volume assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; 2 ) leave ventricular mass index assess MRI ; 3 ) urinary albumin excretion ; 4 ) endothelial-dependent vasodilation assess brachial ultrasound . A total 100 subject enrol research study . This study involve pediatric subject believe early intervention critical decrease morbidity mortality associate condition . If pravastatin show effective ameliorate progression renal cardiovascular disease study , routine management people condition drastically alter .</detailed_description>
