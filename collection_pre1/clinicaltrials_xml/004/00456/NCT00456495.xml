	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety tolerability subconjunctival injection ranibizumab treatment malignant conjunctival neoplasia use incidence severity adverse event . Our secondary objective ass efficacy ranibizumab treatment malignant conjunctival neoplasia evaluate tumor destruction reduction document slit-lamp photography ultrasonographic image regression blood vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Ranibizumab Malignant Conjunctival Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ranibizumab recently approve vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor show effective treat exudative macular degeneration . Its analog , Avastin also employ treat macular edema , proliferative diabetic retinopathy wet age relate macular degeneration . Ranibizumab bind inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , show cause neovascularization leakage model ocular angiogenesis . Binding VEGF-A prevents ranibizumab 's interaction VEGFR-1 -2 receptor surface endothelial cell , thereby reduce proliferation , vascular leakage , angiogenesis . Given conjunctival tumor require formation new blood vessel supply proliferate cell , propose study evaluate effect subconjunctival ranibizumab primary intervention patient conjunctival tumor .</detailed_description>
