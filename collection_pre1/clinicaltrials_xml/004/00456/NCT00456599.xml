	<detailed_description>This study examine sequence treatment include pre-operative chemotherapy radiation , surgery post-operative chemotherapy resectable pancreatic cancer . This research treatment evaluate combination two chemotherapy agent , oxaliplatin gemcitabine radiation therapy . The researcher already do study use oxaliplatin , gemcitabine radiation therapy together pancreatic cancer . They want build information previous research research multiple site . They use study determine well people treat gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , radiation therapy prior surgery pancreatic cancer . The researcher also gather information type side effect occur treatment .</detailed_description>
