	<brief_title>A Phase 1 , Double-Blind , Randomized , Single Dose Escalation Safety Study Intra-articular OP-1 Subjects With Osteoarthritis Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects OA recruit informed consent obtain . During screening period last 1 28 day , subject undergo medical arthritis history , physical examination , collection concomitant medication , KOOS ( contain WOMAC questionnaire ) , SF-36 global 100 mm VAS assessment , sample obtain urinalysis , hematology , chemistry , immunology serum plasma future biomarker testing , ECG , bilateral knee x-ray MRI index knee select site . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion randomize first cohort 8 subject receive either 1.0 mL lactose ( placebo ) ( 2 subject ) 1.0 mL OP-1 ( 6 subject ) intraarticularly use ultrasound fluoroscopy guidance outpatient set day 1 . Each cohort consist 8 treated patient , treatment allocation 3:1 active-to-lactose ( placebo ) ratio . After observation period least one hour , subject release contacted via telephone Day 2 query AEs concomitant medication . Additional follow-up visit do day 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 , 84 168 ( week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 ) safety efficacy parameter evaluate accord Schedule Events . When minimum 4 week elapse since last patient current cohort treat , safety data collect reviewed Principal Investigators Sponsor . The safety review conduct ensure demonstrate safety profile OP-1 acceptable treat patient . Only current dose level judge safe dose escalation next dose cohort occur .</detailed_description>
