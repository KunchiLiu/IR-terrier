	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine component coagulation system woman undergo postpartum hysterectomy compare laboratory parameter coagulation woman woman increase risk postpartum hysterectomy , postpartum hemorrhage postpartum hysterectomy . During normal pregnancy , hemostatic balance tip toward hypercoagulation . Non-obstetric surgical blood loss associate increased coagulation activity . We observe woman undergo postpartum hysterectomy become hypocoagulable secondary consumptive coagulopathy and/or excessive fibrinolysis . This coagulopathy may lead administration multiple blood product . Worldwide , postpartum hemorrhage lead cause maternal death . Plasma level tissue plasminogen activator , urokinase plasminogen activator inhibitor increase pregnancy . During labor delivery activation coagulation occur consumption platelet , coagulation factor inhibitor . Obstetric complication delivery excessively activate coagulation system disseminate intravascular coagulation may ensue . Current treatment postpartum coagulopathy non-specific primarily consist replace blood component . If specific cause marker abnormal coagulation identify woman risk , might possible target ( specific medication ) specific abnormality early process decrease hemorrhage need blood transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All woman schedule Cesarean-hysterectomy ask enroll study , well woman follow diagnosis , put increase risk Cesarean hysterectomy : placenta previa , placenta accreta , vaginal trial labor previous Cesarean delivery . Written , inform consent obtain subject . A blood sample obtain shortly admission hospital . In woman go hysterectomy , blood sample obtain predefined time period ( time decision perform hysterectomy , every clinically indicate blood draw coagulation test , 2 hour delivery . The next patient risk Cesarean hysterectomy , go hysterectomy , serve cohort control . Blood sample draw 2 hour delivery coagulation test . Baseline sample study subject discard blood work obtain . The primary outcome level fibrinogen 2 hour follow delivery marker consumptive coagulopathy . Every patient risk hemorrhage least one peripheral intravenous cannula insert upon admission Labor &amp; Delivery Unit . A 2nd IV cannula almost always place , usually decision make proceed Cesarean delivery . All study subject 2nd IV cannula place draw blood study coagulation test , clinically indicate blood test . The cannula connect stopcock `` heparin lock '' ( cannula stopcock flush saline aspiration ) leave place 48 hour delivery .</detailed_description>
