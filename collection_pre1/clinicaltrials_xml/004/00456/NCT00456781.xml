	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness GraftJacket , human tissue product use fix large massive reparable rotator cuff tears.GraftJacket allograft ( Wright Medical Technology , Inc. , Arlington , TN ) biologic tissue derive human dermis . The primary purpose study determine whether rotator cuff repair augmentation use GraftJacket allograft provide viable alternative , base observed clinical outcome , versus outcome traditionally achieve suture anchor repair . The study secondarily investigate difference outcome patient treat arthroscopically versus open . This study report patient progress result early ( 6 month ) late ( 2 year ) time point patient treat large massive reparable rotator cuff tear ( &gt; 3cm ) . A reparable tear define tear rotator cuff possible bring retract tendon edge back great tuberosity humerus without excessive tension . Restoration rotator cuff integrity , clinical outcome re-tear rate include study evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective multi-center clinical study evaluate GraftJacket augmentation large massive rotator cuff tear compare traditional surgical technique suture anchor alone . The study group consist 160 patient ( early withdrawal drop out replace ) . Surgical approach patient either mini-open arthroscopic . Safety assessment clinical study base report adverse event . Any adverse event occur study represent change patient 's condition note baseline [ determine normal standard care ] related procedure document complete adverse event case report form . Each investigator indicate operative technique ( mini-open arthroscopic ) use study period site . The site selection process use attempt attain equal distribution operative technique use study . Patients randomly assign treatment group A B . A randomization scheme use 2 block model use within surgical technique . Randomization card meeting requirement process generate statistician . Both surgical technique treatment group use assessment comparison throughout study period . Enrollment Plan GraftJacket Rotator Cuff Tendon Reinforcement Scaffold Surgical Technique Open Surgical ( suture anchor ) Arthroscopic Group A without augmentation Group B GraftJacket Group A without augmentation Group B GraftJacket Patients reparable rotator cuff repair must present large massive rotator cuff tear 3cm , repair either arthroscopically open surgery eligible enrollment . A reparable rotator cuff tear define tear rotator cuff possible bring retract tendon edge back great tuberosity humerus without excessive tension . It possible accomplish watertight repair leave residual defect less equal 1cm . The anteroposterior mediolateral dimension rotator cuff tear assess intra-operatively measurement either include edge edge trim depend judgment surgeon . Rotator cuff tear involve subscapularis tendon include study , postoperative rehabilitation difficult may confound outcome result either group . Surgical variable document source document appropriate CRFs size rotator cuff tear , number tendon involve , type repair ( open , mini-open , arthroscopic ) type number suture anchor . Both clinical assessment magnetic resonance imaging use evaluate effectiveness surgical technique group A B . A screen/baseline MRI obtain affected shoulder preoperative visit . This MRI use evaluate extent involvement determine suitability enrollment study include size tear extent muscle atrophy . Images obtain within 3 month sign consent may use assess eligibility enrollment . Three additional follow-up MRIs affect shoulder obtain part 2 year post-operative evaluation use evaluate structural success group A , suture anchor group B , GraftJacket® allograft augmentation . The MRI scan perform 6 month , 12 month 24 month use determine rate re-tear help assess integrity rotator cuff . Re-tears evident 6-month MRI consider failure surgical technique , exclude follow-up within study follow separately . The comparison proportion re-tears patient group A B complete MRI regimen 2 year use determine GraftJacket® augmentation viable alternative suture anchor . The Investigator use clinical , functional , radiological , assessment adverse event assessment surgical technique group A B evaluate patient enrol clinical study . Pre Operative Procedures - Screen ( Baseline ) Screening activity perform Visit 1 . The protocol require follow assessment visit : - Informed consent process complete study related activity begin - Inclusion/Exclusion criterion evaluation study entry qualification - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) - American Shoulder Elbow Society ( ASES ) Scale - University California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Score - Constant-Murley Score ( CMS ) Operative Procedures The protocol require completion follow assessment Visit 2 : - Open wound evaluation rotator cuff tear classification large massive measurement tear confirm size length - Enrollment confirm use WMT randomization scheme patient assignment Post Operative Procedures Protocol require follow assessment complete 1 month ( plus 15 day ) -Visit 3 ; 3 month ( plus 15 day ) -Visit 4 ; 6 month ( plus 30 day ) -Visit 5 12 month ( plus 30 day ) -Visit 6 : - MRI - Only perform 6 month ( plus 30 day ) -Visit 5 12 month ( plus 30 day ) -Visit 6 - ASES Scale - CMS - UCLA Score End Study Protocol require completion follow assessment 24 month ( plus 30 day ) -Visit 7 : - MRI - ASES Scale - CMS - UCLA Score - Completion End Study Evaluation Form Principal Investigator 4.7 Scientific validity study design : Address strength weaknesses select design . Specifically indicate particular design select . ( 1 page maximum - adhere page limitation ) Strengths : Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial Weakness : While true weakness , trial randomize regular way use `` Expertise Randomization '' style surgeon choose particular expertise surgical repair rotator cuff ( mini-open arthroscopic ) patient randomize within group . A telephone randomization scheme use envelope available surgeon OR group .</detailed_description>
