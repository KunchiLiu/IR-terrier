	<brief_title>Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia : Pharmacoeconomics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research investigate outcome pharmacoeconomics patient diagnose heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) . Background : Heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) complication heparin therapy receive wide-scale awareness , increase detection , concern . Data control study demonstrate low incidence HIT low molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) compare unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) However , registry data compare incidence HIT patient receive LWMH vs. UFH scarce . We define incidence HIT patient receive LWMH vs. UFH `` real world '' set Brigham Women 's Hospital . We evaluate associate clinical economic implication . Our Objectives : 1 . Compare HIT rate associate heparin LMWH usage : The incidence HIT assess initial type heparin exposure responsible causing HIT . Patients categorize receive UFH without LMWH receive LMWH . 2 . Evaluate economic burden HIT hospital and/or payors : We capture expense associate patient admission . Hospital expense tabulate daily use hospital database proprietary cost accounting system , Transition Systems , Inc ( TSI ) . Expenses categorized procedure area care include Emergency Department care , operate room use , hospital room board , hospital base physician fee , nurse labor , dialysis , clinical laboratory study ( hematology , microbiology , cytology , urinalysis ) , radiology ( magnetic resonance imaging , computer axial tomography , ultrasound image ) , ancillary service ( support nutrition support , occupational , respiratory , physical therapy service ) , medication , diagnostic procedure ( cardiac catheterization , electrophysiologic testing , endoscopy , vascular ultrasound , pathology ) , diagnostic testing ( electrocardiogram , electroencephalogram , electromyography ) . We compare mean total hospitalization cost UFH induce HIT associate LMWH induce HIT . Where possible compare individual resource use within two group . 3 . Evaluate long-term clinical burden recurrence HIT : All patient diagnose HIT study period evaluate documented prior diagnosis HIT . Additionally , patient monitor 12 month follow initial diagnosis HIT subsequent diagnosis HIT . The long-term clinical burden HIT assess track rate in-hospital subsequent mortality . Patient Identification : Brigham Women 's Hospital sophisticate computerized system integrate medical , laboratory , pharmacy data . Patients receive UFH enoxaparin subsequently develop HIT identified via computer generate report design purpose study . All patient diagnosis HIT study period ( January 2004 - December 2005 ) include evaluation . Criteria HIT positive diagnosis include : clinical suspicion HIT , decrease platelet &lt; 150,000 50 % baseline , serologic confirmation define positive PF4 ELISA test . Patients monitor clinical symptom HIT ( new thrombosis , thrombocytopenia ) . Patients follow clinical outcome incur expense hospitalization period subsequent outpatient follow . Data Collection : A protocol specific database create Access platform house collect data . Data analyze internally Venous Thromboembolism Research Group .</detailed_description>
