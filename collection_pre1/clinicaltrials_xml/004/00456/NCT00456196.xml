	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) Research Group explore studied epidemiology DVT pulmonary embolism ( PE ) 2 decade . The early analysis do database Framingham Heart Study . Subsequent analyse undertaken use Nurses ' Health Study . More 5 year ago DVT FREE Registry conceive . The concept accrue broad representation patient ultrasound-confirmed DVT throughout US . The Principal Investigator begin initial work project develop case report form ( CRF ) Co-Investigators . After CRF pilot finalize , center recruit participation . The enthusiasm response DVT FREE overwhelming . The initial investigator meeting conduct videoconference shortly September 11 , 2001 . Accrual patient occur much rapidly project . Within 6 month , 5,451 patient enrol ultrasound-confirmed DVT 183 participate institution . Dr. Samuel Z. Goldhaber chair Publications Committee . The Master Paper publish January 2004 . 3 manuscript subgroups 3 manuscript special population subsequently publish Dr. Goldhaber 's supervision . The subgroup paper study upper extremity DVT , relationship DVT symptomatic DVT PE , predictor massive DVT . The special population paper study gender difference receive prophylaxis , utilization vena cava filter , pregnancy . Though publication record impressive scope , much work remain do . The database rich information critical importance health care provider . The information contain within database analyze provide detailed analysis use risk factor assessment decision-making regard implementation VTE prophylaxis . For current DVT FREE publication project , use database analyze finding yield 8 publication special population : 1 ) medically ill hospitalize patient , 2 ) cancer patient , 3 ) nonorthopedic general surgery patient , 4 ) orthopedic surgery patient , 5 ) long-haul travel patient , 6 ) COPD Patients , 7 ) Renal Patients , 8 ) Elderly Patients . PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 1 . Medically Ill Hospitalized Patients : Medically ill hospitalize patient important subgroup study . These patient often receive guideline-recommended prophylaxis . We believe medically ill hospitalize patient underserved . For DVT FREE publication , exclude patient surgery within past 3 month . We also exclude woman pregnant postpartum . All patient include analysis . They stratify accord age , height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 2 . Cancer Patients : Cancer patient receive increase attention relationship cancer DVT . For example , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) organize special committee write consensus guideline prevention treatment DVT patient population . For DVT FREE publication , include patient cancer . We also include whether cancer active whether patient receive ongoing radiation therapy chemotherapy . These cancer patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 3 . Nonorthopedic General Surgery Patients : For DVT FREE publication , include nonorthopedic general surgery patient . These patient undergo surgery within 3 month prior DVT . We also explore type surgery ( exclude orthopedic surgery ) type anesthetic use . These patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 4 . Orthopedic Surgery Patients : For DVT FREE publication , include orthopedic surgery patient . We also include patient suffer hip fracture , pelvic fracture , upper extremity fracture , low extremity fracture , fracture within 30 day prior enrollment . We also include patient major trauma spine , pelvis , upper low extremity . These patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 5 . Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) 6 . COPD Patients : For DVT FREE publication , include patient COPD . These patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 7 . Renal Patients : For DVT FREE publication , include renal patient . These patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis . 8 . Elderly Patients : For DVT FREE publication , include elderly patient . For study define elderly 70 year age old . These patient stratify accord age , height , weight , BMI , gender , whether receive prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
