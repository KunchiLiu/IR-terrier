	<brief_title>Pre-Treatment Positron Emission Topography Scanning Increasing Success Antidepressant Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) characterize combination symptom interfere person 's ability work , study , sleep , eat , enjoy activity pleasurable . Studies show little 50 % 60 % individual MDD may respond first antidepressant medication prescribe . Currently psychiatrists lack tool allow select treatment plan likely benefit particular individual . Some chemical abnormality brain people MDD detectable positron emission topography ( PET ) scan . There distinct difference PET scan people MDD respond treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , people MDD respond SSRI treatment , people MDD . This study use pretreatment PET functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan brain predict antidepressant effective people MDD . This may help reduce trial error currently associate antidepressant treatment . Participants study undergo one PET scan one fMRI scan . Within 3 day scan , participant begin take escitalopram , SSRI , daily dose 10 mg , desipramine , norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( NRI ) , start 50mg titrate therapeutic level . After 4 week , participant respond treatment continue additional 4 week current dose . Participants escitalopram respond medication end 4 week begin take 20 mg escitalopram per day . After 8 week either medication , participant medication succeed relieve MDD symptom undergo second antidepressant trial within class do previously . Non-remitters 2 within-class medication trial switch medication group . Study visit occur weekly first 4 week every week remainder study . At visit , participant meet psychiatrist discuss feel since last visit , review medication side effect , complete depression rating questionnaire . Outpatient participant receive total 5 month treatment depression .</detailed_description>
