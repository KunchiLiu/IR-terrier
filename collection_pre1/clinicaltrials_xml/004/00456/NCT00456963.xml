	<detailed_description>1 . Background rationale 1 . Evidence available Data obtain observational study show subject hypertension increase prevalence type II diabetes mellitus compare normotensives , association diabetes hypertension represent markedly increase risk cardiovascular disease ( 1 ) . Also recent overview Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists ' Collaboration indicate risk stroke , coronary event , heart failure , cardiovascular death twice large hypertensive diabetes hypertensive without diabetes , independently absence treatment use different antihypertensive regimen ( 2 ) . On hand , number observational randomise intervention trial show antihypertensive therapy may increase risk develop new diabetes mellitus hypertensives patient . This evidence review meta-analysed several recent paper ( 3,4 ) . In brief , 13 large randomise trial antihypertensive therapy , 12 show great incidence new diabetes mellitus treatment arm use thiazide diuretic beta-blockers ( often two type agent association ) treatment arm base angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) calcium antagonist ( CAs ) ( often addition thiazide sometimes beta-blockers ) ( 3 ) . Furthermore , recent review analyse 48 group subject without diabetes mellitus time randomization 22 clinical trial . 17 trial enrol patient hypertension , 3 enrol high risk patient , 1 enrol patient heart failure . The primary outcome represent incident diabetes mellitus . Overall , antihypertensive class find associate newly develop diabetes mellitus , increase order , ACEIs , ARBs , follow CAs placebo ( 4 ) . It debate whether thiazide diuretic beta-blockers really diabetogenic , exaggerate accelerate time-dependent tendency develop diabetes , whether ACEIs ARBs antidiabetogenic retard normal trend , simply lack diabetogenic effect thiazides/beta-blockers . The issue , obvious clinical importance , solve placebo-controlled study , placebo-controlled study ethically difficult conduct nowadays evidence favour active treatment hypertension cardiovascular risk overwhelm . Nonetheless , data small number placebo-controlled study available . The diuretic chlorthalidone , often associate beta-blocker , compare placebo elderly patient isolate systolic hypertension Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) trial : current definition diabetes use ( fast glucose , FG , &gt; =126 mg/dl ) , significant high incidence diabetes find actively treat group ( 13 vs 8.7 % , p &lt; 0.0001 ) ( 5 ) , find substantiates hypothesis diuretic beta-blocker therapy exaggerate trend towards develop diabetes , i.e . diabetogenic effect . Placebo-controlled study also available concern effect ACEIs ARBs diabetes onset . Unfortunately , trial placebo group contaminate administration multiple therapy require control cardiovascular pathology patient study . In Study Cognition Prognosis Elderly ( SCOPE ) , concern elderly patient hypertension , use hydrochlothiazide beta-blockers extensive call `` placebo '' arm active ( candesartan ) treatment arm , may explain high incidence diabetes placebo candesartan group ( 6 ) . Likewise , four large trial ACEI ARB compare placebo patient high cardiovascular risk coronary heart disease heart failure , ACEI ARB placebo give top multiple background therapy require severity disease investigate . Furthermore , little information available publication trial extent background therapy modify trial whether change balance placebo active treatment arm trial ( see 3 ) . Therefore issue whether ACEIs ARBs active antidiabetogenic action simply lack diabetogenic action thiazide beta-blockers remains undecided , claim agent block renin-angiotensin system exert antidiabetogenic action appear unjustified . Prevention onset diabetes , well hypertension , even ominous association diabetes hypertension , remain , however , primary public health concern , morbidity burden represent ailment health care cost involve . Prevention must obviously exerted disease develop , effective subject risk develop disease high . Conditions predispose hypertension diabetes well know . Individuals so-called high-normal blood pressure ( i.e. , systolic blood pressure , SBP , 130-139 , diastolic blood pressure , DBP , 85-89 mmHg ) 40 % chance become hypertensive ( i.e. , SBP &gt; =140 DBP &gt; =90 mmHg ) 4 year accord Framingham Heart Study ( 7 ) initial finding Trial Of Preventing Hypertension ( TROPHY , 8 ) . High-normal BP together impair glucose tolerance ( indicated fasting glucose , FG , &gt; =100 mg/dl ) , abdominal obesity , low HDL-cholesterol high triglyceride often find cluster large portion population USA Europe , cluster commonly refer metabolic syndrome ( MS ) ( 9 ) . Independently current debate whether manifestation MS due common pathophysiological mechanism ( i.e. , insulin resistance ) , undisputed coexistence high-normal BP , raise FG elevate BMI strong predictor hypertension diabetes mellitus . 2 . Knowledge effect Lifestyle change ( suitable diet physical exercise ) know effective preventing hypertension ( 10 ) diabetes ( 10-12 ) , whether addition ACEI ARB may reduce condition unknown . Individuals MS ideal subject investigate whether agent block renin-angiotensin system exert real antidiabetogenic effect addition achieve non-pharmacologic measure , compel medical indication treat subject drug may confound interpretation finding . Therefore PHIDIAS trial plan study large cohort individual high-normal BP , high FG ( cut-off value diabetes ) abdominal obesity , instruct lifestyle change . They randomly double-blindly assigned placebo , ACEI ARB period approximately 3 year , order investigate whether blockade renin-angiotensin system top lifestyle advise reduce onset diabetes , hypothesis far base animal study suggest ARBs may partial agonist peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR-gamma ) involve regulate insulin sensitivity ( 13 ) . Furthermore , subject follow additional 6 month withdrawal randomise medication investigate whether preventive action endure survive medication . 3 . Implication AIFA NHS Both conduct result PHIDIAS expect favourable implication Italian Agency Medicinal Products ( AIFA ) Italian National Health System ( NHS ) . The conduct trial PHIDIAS commit general practitioner involve individual high risk cardiovascular disease , effectively promote education healthier lifestyle measure help prevention cardiovascular disease diabetes . The result trial also considerable impact AIFA NHS : 1 ) addition ACEI ARB lifestyle measure show preventive effect diabetes , claim antidiabetogenic action agent disprove , use diabetes prevention discourage ; 2 ) ACEI ARB find prevent hypertension and/or diabetes , effect significantly different ACEI find effective ARB , use generic ACEI- one administer PHIDIAS- represent benefit subject combine considerable saving NHS ; 3 ) ARB find significantly effective ACEI preventing diabetes , implicate temporarily increase cost NHS , largely compensate long term decrease delay onset diabetes hypertension , well complication . 4 . Differences current trial PHIDIAS substantially differ ongoing trial diabetes prevention . The Diabetes Reduction Assessment Ramipril Rosiglitazone Medication ( DREAM ) trial ( 14-15 ) Nateglinide Valsartan Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research ( NAVIGATOR ) trial ( 16 ) direct diabetes prevention . Both intend test ACEI ( DREAM ) ARB ( NAVIGATOR ) versus antidiabetic agent ( rosiglitazone DREAM , nateglinide NAVIGATOR ) versus placebo factorial design , individual select primarily basis impair glucose tolerance , cardiovascular condition exclude : DREAM 43 % recruited subject hypertensives 35 % dyslipidemic , NAVIGATOR previous cardiovascular disease risk factor criteria eligibility . Therefore study investigation possible antidiabetogenic effect ACEI ARB likely confound extent concomitant therapy hypertension cardiovascular disease . Finally TROPHY trial ( 8 ) plan prevention hypertension ( ARB candesartan ) explore equally important issue diabetes prevention blockade renin-angiotensin system . 2 . Objectives study 1 . Primary objective . In group individual high-normal blood pressure ( SBP 130-139 , DBP 85-89 mmHg ) , FG high nondiabetic range ( 100-125 mg/dl ) , abdominal obesity ( abdominal circumference &gt; = 102 cm men &gt; = 88 cm woman ) , i.e . characteristic call MS major predictor DM HT , trial explore whether addition agent block renin-angiotensin system ( either ACEI ARB ) periodically reinforce instruction suitable lifestyle change reduces : 1 ) onset diabetes ( define FG &gt; = 126 mg/dl need antidiabetic therapy ) 2 ) onset hypertension ( define SBP &gt; = 140 DBP &gt; = 90 mmHg , need antihypertensive therapy ) significantly great extent addition placebo . 2 . Secondary objective . In group individual , trial also investigate whether 1 ) diabetes prevent effect ACEI ARB significantly differ , different block mechanisms renin-angiotensin system , additional action bradykinin , respectively , PPAR gamma two agent , 2 ) effect ACEI ARB onset diabetes hypertension enduring , persist 3 6 month substitution active drug placebo . Obviously , preventive effect substantially survive medication would strengthen therapeutic role agent , whereas disappearance effect short period would suggest mask effect . 3 . Study design 1 .

Careful search make visit concomitant medication use intermittently continuously . m. Follow . As illustrated Fig . 1 ( Annex 2 ) , follow-up visit occur every 6 month ( ± 1 ) . The trial ( see Sample size calculation ) event-driven , expect treatment phase approximately 3 year . n. Subjects lose follow The subject NHS list participate physician , expect loss follow minimal ( probably less 5 % ) , consist subject withdraw consent participate study ( take randomise medication ) . . Monitoring study Monitoring entire study , committee , centre , participate practitioner responsibility coordinate institution , supervision Principal investigator . Monitoring participate unit do electronically continuous way , support professional agency . p. Sample size estimate The primary hypothesis incidence diabetes , separately , hypertension reduce active treatment ( cumulative data enalapril losartan-treated group ) 25 % respect placebo treatment . For evaluate difference placebo group two actively treat group together , two-tailed type I error 5 % power 90 % accept . The main secondary hypothesis either two active treatment ( enalapril versus losartan ) reduce incidence diabetes 25-30 % , two-tailed type I error 5 % power 70-90 % . On basis Framingham Heart Study data high-normal BP subject ( 7 ) initial finding TROPHY ( 8 ) , incidence hypertension study population expect close 10 % per year . Assessment expect incidence diabetes difficult variable data provide previous study . In hypertension trial suggest possible antidiabetogenic action ACEIs ARBs , annual incidence diabetes 1.2 4 % ( 3 ) , trial also explore predictor new diabetes suggest high annual incidence subject high risk diabetes , follow : 2.6 % ELSA , patient metabolic syndrome ( 19 ) , 2.7 % CAPPP , upper risk tertile ( 20 ) , 3.4 % LIFE , upper risk quartile ( 21 ) , 2.7 % 7.2 % VALUE , third fourth risk quartile ( 22 ) 6.2 % DREAM ( 15 ) . Three recent trial investigate intervention prevent diabetes subject impair glucose tolerance ( presumably rather similar PHIDIAS , multivariable definition risk show outperform glucose tolerance test predicting onset diabetes report yearly incidence diabetes 7.5 % ( 23 ) , 11 % ( 23 ) 12.7 % ( 24 ) , reduce 3.7-4.8 % intense lifestyle counselling . Finally , DREAM study ( 15 ) base hypothesis patient impair glucose tolerance diabetes annual accrue rate 4.5 % . On basis evidence , choose conservative hypothesis yearly accrue rate diabetes 3.5 % , i.e . incidence 10.5 % 3 year . This low incidence rate expect hypertension , sample size calculate diabetes rate . It assume , suppose 4.8 % loss follow-up , placebo-treated group 2000 subject develop 200 case diabetes three year , two actively treated group , 2000 subject , develop altogether 300 case diabetes . These number provide require alpha 5 % power 90 % detect 25 % reduction diabetes incidence two active treatment group together ( 7.5 % 3 year ) compare placebo group ( 10 % 3 year ) . As secondary hypothesis , 2000 subject enalapril losartan group sufficient detect low incidence 25 % one group ( 6.4 % incidence 3 year ) versus ( 8.5 % ) ( alpha 5 % , power 72 % ) low incidence 30 % ( 6.2 versus 8.8 3 year ) ( alpha 5 % , power 88 % ) , suppose 4.8 % loss follow-up . In case study event driven , continue 500 case diabetes observed . q. Organisation PHIDIAS govern Steering Committee , chair Principal Investigator ( A.Zanchetti ) form 7 member ( G. Mancia , B.
