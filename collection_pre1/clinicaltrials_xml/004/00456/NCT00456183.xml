	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity MVA85A Volunteers Latently Infected With TB .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) kill three million people annually . It estimate one third world ’ population latently infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) ( Dye , 1999 ) . These latently infect individual risk reactivation infection , become immunosuppressed . Worldwide , coinfection HIV commonest cause immunosuppression increase chance reactivation 10 % lifetime risk 10 % annual risk ( Corbett , 1996 ) . The currently available vaccine , M. bovis BCG , largely ineffective protect adult pulmonary disease endemic area widely agree new effective tuberculosis vaccine major global public health priority ( Colditz , 1994 ) . However , may unethical impractical test deploy vaccine strategy include BCG , BCG confer worthwhile protection TB meningitis leprosy . An immunisation strategy include BCG also attractive population vaccine candidate need test already immunise BCG . Given high prevalence infection M.tb , vaccine could administer latently infect individual eradicate latent infection would enormous impact mortality morbidity TB . M.tb intracellular organism . CD4+ Th1-type cellular response essential protection increase evidence animal human study CD8+ T cell also play protective role ( Flynn , 2001 ) . However , generally difficult induce strong cellular immune response human use subunit vaccine . DNA vaccine , recombinant viral vector protein/adjuvant combination induce CD4+ CD8+ T cell , however none antigen delivery system induce high level antigen specific T cell , use alone . Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategy involve give two different vaccine , encode antigen , several week apart . Using DNA prime-recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) boost induces high level antigen specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell use homologous boost vector number different disease model ( Schneider , 1998 ; McShane , 2001 ) . Given protective efficacy BCG childhood , ideally BCG would prim immunisation prime-boost strategy . In order , focus antigen 85A candidate antigen . Antigen 85A highly conserve amongst mycobacterial specie present strain BCG . Antigen 85A major secrete antigen M. tuberculosis form part antigen 85 complex ( A , B C ) . This complex constitute major portion secrete protein M.tb BCG . It involve fibronectin binding within cell wall mycolyltransferase activity . Antigen 85A immunodominant murine human study protective small animal ( Huygen , 1996 ) . Recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( rMVA ) . Many virus investigate potential recombinant vaccine . The successful worldwide eradication smallpox via vaccination live vaccinia virus highlight vaccinia candidate recombinant use . The recognition recent year nonreplicating strain poxvirus MVA avipox vector immunogenic traditional replicating vaccinia strain enhance attractiveness approach . MVA ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara ) strain vaccinia virus passaged 570 time though avian cell , replication incompetent human cell line good safety record . It administer 120,000 vaccinee part smallpox eradication programme , adverse effect , despite deliberate vaccination high risk group ( Stickl , 1974 ; Mahnel , 1994 ) . This safety man consistent avirulence MVA animal model . MVA six major genomic deletion compare parental genome severely compromise ability replicate mammalian cell ( Meher , 1991 ) . No replication document nontransformed mammalian cell . Viral replication block late infection cell importantly viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired even abortive infection . The viral genome proven stable large series passage chicken embryo fibroblast . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA see exceptionally safe viral vector . When test animal model study recombinant MVAs show avirulent , yet protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . Recent study severely immuno-suppressed macaque support view MVA safe immuno-compromised human ( Akira , 2001 ; Stittelaar , 2001 ) . There safety data number recombinant MVAs currently Phase I/II trial UK Africa . Useful data safety efficacy various dos recombinant MVA vaccine come clinical trial data recombinant MVA express number CTL epitopes Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigen fuse complete pre-erythrocytic stage antigen , Thrombospondin Related Adhesion Protein ( TRAP ) . To date MVA ME-TRAP administer 250 healthy volunteer Oxford The Gambia without serious adverse event ( Adrian Hill , personal communication ) . Volunteers receive one three dose 3 15 x 107 pfu per dose intra-dermal vaccine three-week interval . All subject temporary local redness typically 5mm central red area paler pink surround area range size 1 –7cm diameter peak 48 hour post vaccination . At seven day post vaccination generally central red area remain . This fade next week usually apparent 2 month vaccination . The emerge safety profile recombinant MVA vaccine support data clinical study three MVA recombinant make Oxford currently clinical study use MVAs HIV , HBV melanoma . Recombinant MVA encode antigen 85A MVA85A induces CD4+ CD8+ epitope use immunise mouse . When mouse prim BCG give MVA85A boost , level CD4+ CD8+ T cell induce high either BCG MVA85A alone , regime protective either vaccine alone ( Goonetilleke et al , 2003 ) . In sensitive guinea pig model , guinea pig vaccinate BCG , MVA85A , second viral vector , fowlpox express antigen 85A , 6/6 guinea pig alive end experiment , compare 2/6 guinea pig vaccinate BCG alone , 0/6 control animal ( Williams et al , submit ) . In rhesus macaque , BCG prime-MVA85A Fowlpox85A boost immunogenic vaccine alone . Clinical study use MVA85A MVA85A ( dose 5 x 107pfu ) administer 40 healthy volunteer UK 15 healthy volunteer The Gambia , serious adverse event . We design Phase I study allow vaccination volunteer group sequentially step-wise increase mycobacterial exposure , order minimize possibility Koch reaction . A Koch reaction describes development immunopathology person animal tuberculosis , exaggerate immune response M.tb stimulate . It describe patient TB disease Koch perform original study employ mycobacteria type therapeutic vaccination . It demonstrate mouse model therapeutic vaccination ( Taylor , 2003 ) . Available animal data suggest reaction occur mice latently infect M.tb , suggest reaction may correlate high bacterial load Koch phenomenon may pose problem vaccination healthy albeit latently infect human . We start study healthy volunteer mycobacterially naïve possible . They skin test negative Elispot negative PPD , ESAT 6 CFP10 , previously vaccinate BCG . We complete study UK vaccinate volunteer previously vaccinate BCG ( McShane , submit ) . These volunteer exclude Heaf test great grade II . These study ongoing The Gambia . The next group plan vaccinate increase mycobacterial spectrum healthy volunteer latently infect M.tb . Rationale This study design evaluate safety MVA85A healthy volunteer UK latently infect M.tb . A single vaccination MVA85A , administer dose 5 x 107pfu intradermally , safe mycobacterially naïve individual previously vaccinate BCG . We use vaccination regime study . Subjects define latently infect positive elispot response ESAT6 CFP10 . Subjects identify TB contact clinic .</detailed_description>
