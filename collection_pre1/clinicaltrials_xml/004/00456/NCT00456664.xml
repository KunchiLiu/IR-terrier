	<detailed_description>At present , human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) remain major health threat immune compromise patient . Especially HCMV cause blind death HIV-1 infect person . Currently , antiviral drug choose treatment HCMV infection . Besides , drug resistant virus strain report led failure antiviral therapy . Various diagnostic method available CMV infection . Such shell vial assay , CMV antigen test , pp65 antigen assay polymerase chain reaction . But none could standard highly valuable . Although CMV-PCR sensitive , ca n't distinguish active disease asymptomatic infection latency , ca n't predict symptomatic disease ca n't monitor successful antiviral therapy . Our first goal setup series molecular diagnostic tool HIV-1 infect person . By use tool , physician easily select case CMV disease immune restoration inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) enroll study . Furthermore , seek predict marker CMV reactivation , CMV disease IRIS . Finally , research focus mechanism IE gene alternative splice lytic latent stage . We may find new therapeutic concept prevent virus reactivation latency .</detailed_description>
