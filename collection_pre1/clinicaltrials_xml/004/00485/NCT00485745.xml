However , incidence repeat sternotomy high pediatric population , overall number patient considerably small , relative dearth information literature regard risk outcomes associate repeat sternotomy . The large series report publish Russell colleague 1998 include 192 repeat sternotomies perform 165 patient . 3 The author report 5.2 % incidence cardiac laceration selective utilization femoro-femoral bypass decompress heart repeat sternotomy `` high risk '' patient .</detailed_description>
