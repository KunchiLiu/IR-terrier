	<brief_summary>Elderly , postmenopausal woman breast cancer aromatase inhibitor increase risk develop bone loss osteoporosis . We postulate elderly , osteopenic postmenopausal woman aromatase inhibitor therapy , bisphosphonate therapy ( 1 ) prevent bone loss clinically relevant site , spine hip ( 2 ) decrease bone turnover .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Bisphosphonate Bone Loss Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer Initiating Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial test hypothesis risedronate 35 mg weekly , potent antiresorptive agent , prevent bone loss improve bone mass decrease bone turnover elderly , osteopenic , postmenopausal woman ( age 55 older ) breast cancer aromatase inhibitor therapy . 110 subject randomize receive either oral risedronate 35 mg weekly placebo two year . Our primary outcome variable change PA spine bone mineral density ( BMD ) . Secondary endpoint BMD total hip , femoral neck , trochanter , lateral spine , forearm , total body , marker bone turnover . We also assess improvement BMD great site trabecular bone ( spine ) versus cortical bone ( wrist ) . BMD measure six month interval . Biochemical marker bone turnover measure baseline , 6 month , 12 month , 24 month .</detailed_description>

Women history illness know affect bone mineral metabolism , renal failure ( estimate GFR &lt; 30 ) , hepatic failure , malignancy ( exclude breast cancer , treat superficial basal squamous cell carcinoma malignancy diagnosis treatment would adversely affect bone metabolism ) , untreated primary hyperparathyroidism , malabsorption . Women treat oral glucocorticoid therapy &gt; 3 month suppression therapy , certain antiseizure medication may adversely affect bone metabolism ( phenobarbital , phenytoin , carbamazepine ) . Those untreated active peptic ulcer disease Those osteoporosis BMD ( Tscore 2.5 SD spine total hip ) history fragility fracture adult . However , discuss , osteoporotic woman may elect enroll study . Women treat oral bisphosphonates calcitonin 3 month within last year ( 3 month washout period ) Men child exclude get postmenopausal osteoporosis follow treatment aromatase inhibitor Women poor dental hygiene ( assessed baseline dental exam ) need dental extraction study Use fluoride 1 month ever ( except dental treatment ) Less 2 evaluable vertebra Distant metastatic disease</criteria>
