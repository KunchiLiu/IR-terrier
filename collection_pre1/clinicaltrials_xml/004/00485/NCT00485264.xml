	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Raltegravir HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) -Infected Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Integrase one three enzyme necessary HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) replication . Integrase allow integration HIV DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) human genome . Raltegravir strong selective inhibitor HIV integrase . In adult , raltegravir show significant antiretroviral activity clinical trial well tolerate . The purpose study determine appropriate dose raltegravir across pediatric age range 4 week ( 30 day ) 18 year age , acquire short long term safety data , intensive population PK data , efficacy experience raltegravir treatment-experienced , HIV-infected child adolescent . The study consist two sequential Stages : I II . The dose finding period Stage I intend examine pharmacokinetics short term tolerability safety raltegravir limit number participant permit dose selection study Stage II . The dose find algorithm require preliminary assessment data first 4 patient cohort ( term `` mini-cohort '' ) . Failure meet PK target require dose adjustment , contingent upon mini-cohort 's dose meet safety criterion , follow reassessment safety PK data new mini-cohort dose . When mini-cohort dose pass safety PK criterion , accrual assessment result full cohort could occur . Again , failure meet PK target require dose adjustment contingent upon full cohort 's dose meet safety criterion subsequent PK safety evaluation data new cohort take new dose . Chronic dosing , include Stage I extension ( period Stage I dose find ) Stage II ( additional participant enrol ) , intend provide long term safety antiviral activity data large sample participant . Participants accrued Stage I treat dose ultimately select cohort combine accrue Stage II , patient receive final select dos respective cohort . This group denote Final Dose Population , result group consider primary , since reflect age-specific dos propose commercial use . The group participant expose raltegravir ( dose ) denote All Treated Population . Stage I last minimum 48 week , Stage II 48 week , long-term follow-up period last 5 year initial exposure ( i.e. , 48 week treatment plus 4 year follow-up ) . Participants stratify age assign one six cohort . Participants Cohort I age 12 18 year receive poloxamer film coat raltegravir tablet . Participants Cohort IIA age 6 11 year , weigh least 25 kg , receive poloxamer film coat raltegravir tablet . Participants Cohort IIB age 6 11 year receive chewable raltegravir tablet . Participants Cohort III age 2 5 year receive chewable raltegravir tablet . Participants Cohort IV age 6 month ( define 180 day ) 23 month receive oral granule suspension . Participants Cohort V age 4 week ( define 30 day ) 5 month receive oral granule suspension . Enrollment Stage I study begin Cohort I progress cohort preliminary dosage determine safety data review . When information determine Cohort I , Cohorts IIA IIB begin enrollment . Once safety dose data cohort review , enrollment Cohort III begin . Once safety dose data Cohort III review , enrollment Cohorts IV begin safety dose data Cohort IV review , enrollment Cohorts V begin . During Stage II study , participant take raltegravir dosage determine safe reach PK target base Stage I data . The purpose Stage II determine long-term safety raltegravir safe dose meeting PK target determine . Participants whose Stage I dose different dose determine Stage II individual dose adjustment extreme PK value raltegravir dose change select Stage II dose determine . If individualize dose participant manner result dose increase , participant additional safety visit 4 week dose modification , continue study visit change visit schedule . There least 9 study visit participant study , occur 48-week raltegravir treatment period . For participant complete 48 week study appear benefit receive study drug , raltegravir provide five year initial raltegravir exposure . For participant opt continue study-provided raltegravir , extended provision drug implement part protocol extension involve visit every 4 month five year initial raltegravir exposure . Participants continue study-provided raltegravir follow annual visit five year initial raltegravir exposure ( i.e . 48 week raltegravir treatment plus 4 year follow-up ) . At visit , physical exam , blood collection , determination treatment adherence occur . At visit , urine collection Tanner stag occur . Selected cohort undergo taste evaluation 1 2 visit . Participants age 2 less 6 year age ask participate additional PK substudy blood collect two time 12-hour visit ( , convenient , assessment may complete 2 separate visit ) order collect additional Cmin PK data . Participants re-registered cohort dose change recommend . On December 21 , 2011 , raltegravir approved FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) combination antiretroviral drug child adolescent age 2 18 base interim analysis study . The present result submission pertain interim analysis . The result present safety efficacy result complete Week 24 data ( primary key secondary endpoint ) Cohort I , IIA , IIB , III participant IMPAACT P1066 , Final Dose Population . By date data frozen , 14Feb2011 , participant enrol Cohorts I , IIA , IIB , III Week 24 data ( i.e. , either complete Week 24 visit , , discontinue Week 24 , potential experience Week 24 visit ) . All participant enrol Cohorts I , IIA , IIB also complete ( potential experience ) Week 48 visit . Note reporting , study ongoing Cohorts I , IIA , IIB , III long-term follow-up Cohorts IV V , Stage II . There another result submission report Cohort IV Cohort V data available .</detailed_description>
