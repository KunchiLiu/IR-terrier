	<brief_title>Study Comparing Conventional vs. Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared abdominal hysterectomy , advantage laparoscopic hysterectomy decrease postoperative intravenous analgesia requirement , short length hospital stay , quick return work daily activity . Longer operate time show offset short hospital stay , similar hospital cost overall . Compared abdominal hysterectomy , laparoscopic hysterectomy associate less blood loss , few abdominal wall infection , febrile episode . The increased visualization allow concomitant evaluation excision adhesion endometriosis , well facilitate oophorectomy . Robotic system develop order facilitate laparoscopy ergonomic movement easier perform precise . The da Vinci Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) endowrist instrument seven degree movement mimic human wrist . It also filter tremor unintentional hand motion may result prolonged hold instrument . The surgeon seat console command laparoscope two laparoscopic surgical instrument . In literature , several case series describe use robotic-assisted hysterectomy . Two series include patient undergo surgery suspect malignancy , hence different patient population go enroll.Overall study demonstrate feasibility use robot-enhanced technology order perform hysterectomy series approximately 10-20 patient , similar rate complication compare classical laparoscopy . The objective study conduct prospective randomize control trial robotic assist versus traditional hysterectomy treatment patient benign indication hysterectomy , e.g . menorrhagia , symptomatic fibroid uterus , etc . Our primary outcome operative time incision either closure , case concomitant prolapse incontinence procedure , completion hysterectomy portion case , i.e . closure vaginal cuff achievement hemostasis hysterectomy . Secondary outcome include intra-operative , peri-operative , post-operative complication ; post-operative patient outcome measure Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) questionnaire . Patient score questionnaire surgery use calculate quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) , use cost utility analysis . Patients ' overall narcotic use quality life also assess surgery diary different interval . The diary consist daily narcotic/pain medication diary , weekly assessment return normal activity , assessments 2 , 4 , 6 week surgical pain ability perform functional activity .</detailed_description>

Other concomitant laparoscopic antiincontinence procedure ( e.g. , excision endometriosis midurethral sling procedure ) perform primary surgeon 's discretion . suspected malignancy , medical illness preclude laparoscopy , inability give inform consent , morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 ) , need concomitant bowel resection .</criteria>
