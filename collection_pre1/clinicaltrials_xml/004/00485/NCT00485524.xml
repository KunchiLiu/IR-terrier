	<brief_summary>Mortality neonatal cardiac repair remain significant , neonates undergone operative repair congenital heart disease may experience sudden unexpected demise . Most deaths occur within first 72 hour attribute poor systemic cardiac output . The literature currently define early reliable predictor poor post-operative outcome child congenital heart disease recently undergone surgery . The investigator wish perform retrospective chart review independently define predictive value NIRS score serial serum lactate level set early post-operative morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison NIRS Serum Lactate Predict Poor Post-operative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The retrospective data collect NIRS score serum level within first 72 hour , pediatric cardiac population less one month age require intra-operative cardiopulmonary bypass . This information review medical chart January 1 , 2002 December 31 , 2005 Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , Egleston Hospital . We predict approximately 1000 chart review . The investigator wish evaluate relationship level cardiac diagnosis , operation perform , post-operative course outcome ; poor outcome define initiation ECMO death . The investigator wish compare predictive value NIRS score serial serum lactate level set assess respective efficacy post-operative cardiac intensive care . The investigator collect follow information medical record : Laboratory : NIRS Indices , serum pH , lactic acid , Co-ox , CBC , Chemistry ) Diagnosis Surgical Procedure Incidence re-operation Length ICU Stay Length Hospital Stay Complications Length Ventilation ( many day ventilator ) Medications Cross Clamp Time Bypass Time Echocardiogram data Cardiac Catheterization Data Vital Signs Monitored Hemodynamic Measures Final outcome ( discharge versus ECMO death ) Demographic data summarize subject . For patient summary statistic include mean , standard deviation , frequency distribution , minimum , maximum range . The investigator wish perform retrospective chart review independently define predictive value NIRS score serial serum lactate level set early post-operative morbidity .</detailed_description>
