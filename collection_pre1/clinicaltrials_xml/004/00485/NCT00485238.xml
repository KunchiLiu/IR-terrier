	<brief_summary>The aim determine approach , immediate argon laser peripheral iridoplasty conventional systemic medical treatment efficiently break acute angle closure attack without consequent visual morbidity . The specific objective see whether sudden intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lower bring laser iridoplasty medical treatment affect optic nerve head structure function identify immediate decompression associate great incidence ocular problem like corneal endothelial compromise , optic disc edema , macular edema , decompression retinopathy , cataract formation , progression chronic angle closure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma ( PACG ) continue major concern Asia . It major cause visual morbidity region1 prevalent type glaucoma especially Chinese Mongoloid descent.2,3 During acute stage disease , prompt institution measure break attack necessary . Two recognize approach utilized practice lower intraocular pressure prepare definitive treatment laser peripheral iridotomy . These conventional topical systemic medical therapy immediate peripheral iridoplasty use either argon diode laser . In study Lim , Tan , Chew , Seah et al. , laser iridoplasty note useful role management medically unresponsive acute angle closure , particularly case laser peripheral iridotomy ( PI ) could successfully performed4 . Randomized control trial Lam , Lai , Tham et al . compare immediate laser peripheral iridoplasty plus topical medication topical systemic medical treatment find significant difference eventual mean IOP requirement glaucoma medication 5 . However , significant difference efficacy observe two treatment arm within first two hour treatment argon laser peripheral iridoplasty topical medication lower IOP faster conventional medications6 . In trial cite , mention sudden IOP lowering effect either argon laser iridoplasty conventional medication optic nerve head visual field status , well effect ocular structure like cornea , lens retina . In literature search , two paper study optic nerve head structure function angle closure glaucoma , immediate period sudden IOP lowering . Ang , Aung , Chua , Yip Chew make comparative assessment visual field loss symptomatic asymptomatic PACG , 50 % asymptomatic PACG subject present end stage visual field loss contrast 7 % symptomatic PACG.7 Lai , Tham , Lam et al . compare retinal nerve fiber layer measurement attack eye fellow eye single unilateral attack acute primary angle closure ( APAC ) use scan laser polarimetry six month acute attack8 . Retinal nerve fiber layer damage document eye duration APAC attack last 48 hours8 . Decompression retinopathy follow laser peripheral iridoplasty acute primary angle closure report two case report Lai , Lee , Leung Chung.9 In order compare efficiency laser peripheral iridoplasty medical treatment , well identify morbidity may come sudden decompression eye , undertake randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
