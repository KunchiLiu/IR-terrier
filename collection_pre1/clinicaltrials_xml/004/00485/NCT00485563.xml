	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 clinical trial collect data tumor response produce folate-hapten conjugate therapy ( vaccination EC90 [ KLH-FITC ] GPI-0100 adjuvant follow treatment EC17 ( folate-FITC ) combination low-dose cytokine patient progressive metastatic renal cell carcinoma . All patient undergo image investigational imaging agent 99mTc-EC20 ( FolateScan ) screen period confirm eligibility treatment portion clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study EC17 ( Folate-hapten Conjugate ) Patients With Progressive Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : This Phase 2 study folate-hapten conjugate therapy combination low-doses cytokine Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Interferon-alpha ( INF-alpha ) . Folate-hapten conjugate treatment consist subcutaneous vaccination EC90 , compound design elicit immune response ( antibody ) dye call fluorescein ( FITC ) , combination GPI-0100 adjuvant ( drug intend improve antibody production ) . Vaccination follow treatment EC17 , drug make link folate ( vitamin ) FITC . Experimental evidence show folate receptor over-expressed many human cancer , include renal cell carcinoma . It expect EC17 attach cancer cell folate receptor antibody FITC recognize cancer cell mark destruction body 's immune system . Two drug , IL-2 IFN-alpha , administer low dos combination EC17 order boost immune response . During screen period , potential patient undergo image 99mTc-EC20 ( technetium-based , folate- link radiopharmaceutical [ EC20 ] ) purpose identify patient whose tumor express folate receptor ; target folate-hapten conjugate therapy . Prior receive EC90/GPI-0100 EC17 therapy , patient must exhibit least one tumor lesion display adequate uptake 99mTc-EC20 imaging procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must histologically confirm diagnosis renal cell carcinoma ( clear cell predominately clear cell component ) . Papillary histology may also enrol ( maximum 6 patient ) Must diagnose relapsed Stage IV disease medically surgically unresectable progressed systemic therapy , include least one agent general class kinase inhibitor ( TKI require papillary histology ) Must measurable/evaluable metastatic disease sit previously receive radiotherapy require palliative intervention ( time enrollment ) . Patients nonmeasurable/evaluable disease ineligible Must least one tumor lesion display uptake 99mTcEC20 Must &gt; = 18 year age Women must either 1 ) childbearing potential 2 ) negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior commence treatment investigational agent Must complete prior cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy experimental therapy 30 day prior study enrollment , recover ( return baseline ) associate acute toxicity . This restriction exclude palliative radiotherapy . Must ECOG score less equal 2 Must adequate hematologic , renal , heptic function Must history severe hypersensitivity ( grade 3 4 allergic reaction ) fluorescein , radiological contrast agent , cytokine , receive fluorescein within 30 day study Must medical condition preclude use IL2 IFNα . Must pregnant breastfeeding Must currently undergo chemotherapy , anticancer hormonal therapy , and/or therapy immunosuppressant agent Must currently receive bisphosphonates Zometa® ( unless start &gt; four week prior treatment EC90/GPI0100 , case continue ) Must concomitant malignancy exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin Must radiographically document evidence current brain metastasis , history stem cell transplant , immunodeficiency , and/or medical psychiatric illness ( investigator 's opinion , would prevent adequate compliance study therapy evaluation endpoint ) Must administer another radiopharmaceutical would interfere assessment 99mTcEC20 Must unable tolerate condition radionuclide image</criteria>
