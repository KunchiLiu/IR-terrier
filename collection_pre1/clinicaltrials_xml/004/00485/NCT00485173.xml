	<brief_title>INFUSE® Bone Graft/ PEEK Interbody Spacer/ Anterior Cervical Plate Pivotal Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pivotal clinical trial conduct evaluate safety effectiveness INFUSE® Bone Graft PEEK Interbody Spacer Anterior Cervical Plate patient symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease ( DDD ) . The implant investigation clinical trial INFUSE® Bone Graft , PEEK Interbody Spacer , Anterior Cervical Plate . The device implant use anterior surgical approach . Safety effectiveness data patient study compare historical control . Historical control data take control arm follow Medtronic study : ( 1 ) Artificial Cervical Disc ( also know PRESTIGE® Cervical Disc System ) pivotal IDE trial ( NCT00642876 ) ( 2 ) BRYAN® Cervical Disc System pivotal IDE trial ( NCT00437190 ) .</detailed_description>
