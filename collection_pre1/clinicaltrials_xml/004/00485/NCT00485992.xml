	<brief_summary>Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( Children 's ) collaborate Child Health Corporation America ( CHCA ) nationwide effort reduce catheter relate blood stream infection ( BSIs ) . `` As well human cost , central venous catheter relate bloodstream infection significantly inflate hospital cost , mainly increase length stay hospital , particularly intensive care '' ( Jones , 2006 ) . The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) participate initiative implementing BSI `` Bundles '' per CHCA guideline . BSI `` bundle '' group patient care practice design reduce BSI infection rate implementation patient care area . The bundle include recommendation central line maintenance include line insertion , dress change , line access , monitor medical necessity . These bundle implement January 16 , 2006 , BSI rate CICU peak 18.2 ( rate infection per 1000 catheter day ) . The BSI rate historically past two year highly variable ( see attach graph data Jan. 04 Oct. 06 ) . The target goal maintain rate 3.7 realize twice since January BSI bundle implementation . Current practice care central line outline BSI Bundles base Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) guideline publish 2002 . These guideline include important change practice involve use chlorhexidine ( CHG ) containing product improve infection prevention . CHG solution currently available either 2 % 3.15 % chlorhexidine gluconate 70 % isopropyl alcohol solution . The Primary Aim determine CHG effective antiseptic wipe access line draw blood administer medication . Compare effectiveness CHG contain alcohol wipe ( 3.15 % CHG/70 % isopropyl alcohol ) plain alcohol order determine best practice CICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( Children 's ) collaborate Child Health Corporation America ( CHCA ) nationwide effort reduce catheter relate blood stream infection ( BSIs ) . The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) participate initiative implementing BSI `` Bundles '' per CHCA guideline . BSI `` bundle '' group patient care practice design reduce BSI infection rate implementation patient care area . Multiple risk factor assume contribute high risk rate infection CICU patient population . Many risk factor control , patient age , weight , diagnosis , etc . Hence controllable risk factor focus reduce BSI rate , primarily relate care central line . This main focus BSI Bundles aim reduce risk associate utilization central line . The primary aim determine CHG effective antiseptic wipe access line draw blood administer medication . Compare effectiveness CHG contain alcohol wipe ( 3.15 % CHG/70 % isopropyl alcohol ) plain alcohol order determine best practice CICU . The secondary aim reduce BSI rate CICU patient population , improve patient care outcomes reduce cost hospitalization result reduction prevention expect BSIs .</detailed_description>
