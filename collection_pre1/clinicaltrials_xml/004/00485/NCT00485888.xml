	<brief_summary>To add understanding relationship blushing , symptom severity potential mechanism underlie blush patient SP , propose compare SP patient ' vascular response topical m-N pre post treatment S-citalopram placebo . S-citalopram ( SSRI ) widely use treatment mood anxiety disorder show efficacy patient ( Lepola et al. , 2003 ; Stahl et al. , 2003 ; Burke et al. , 2002 ; Davidson et al. , 2002 ; Wade et al. , 2002 ) . In comparison placebo , S-citalopram show effective well tolerate short long term SP ( Lader et al 2004 ; Montgomery et al. , 2003 ; Kasper et al. , 2002 ) . As indicated , response blush exposure assess prior follow treatment S-citalopram placebo one month follow intervention . Levels prostaglandin compare group also correlate symptom severity clinical group . Effective psychological intervention reduce fear blushing individual social phobia lead reduction actual blushing social test ( Mulkens et al. , 2001 ) . As , expect patient ' perception amount blush change follow treatment . In addition , undertake investigation whether nican topical administration change follow treatment match pattern see healthy control . The objective evaluate efficacy S-citalopram 10 20 mg daily ( QD ) treatment social phobia determine treatment outcome relate change intensity vasodilatory response 10 mM topical m-N . This randomized , double-blind flexible-dose study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability S-citalopram 10 20 mg placebo outpatient subject diagnose SP . At screen visit eligible enter randomize trial S-citalopram 10 20 mg placebo . The study begin single week S-citalopram 10 mg . Subsequently , capsule administer flexible dose fashion patient follow weekly ( biweekly week 6 ) clinician 's discretion . After first week patient ' dosage increase maximum 20 mg daily . This dose remain fixed 8 week treatment week 16 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective evaluate efficacy S-citalopram 10 20 mg daily ( QD ) treatment social phobia determine treatment outcome relate change intensity vasodilatory response 10 mM topical m-N. Study Population Out-patients ( n = 36 ) primary diagnosis Social Phobia use DSM-IV criterion ( 300.02 ) , without comorbid secondary illness , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible enter study . We choose assign 36 complete subject number desire completers . Given drop rate 20 % , 44 subject enrol study . Study Design This randomize , double-blind flexible-dose study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability S-citalopram 10 20 mg placebo outpatient subject diagnose SP . At screen visit eligible enter randomize trial S-citalopram 10 20 mg placebo . The study begin single week S-citalopram 10mg . Subsequently , capsule administer flexible dose fashion patient follow weekly ( biweekly week 6 ) clinician discretion . After first week patient ' dosage increase maximum 20 mg daily . This dose remain fixed 8 week treatment week 16 . Voluntary discontinuation subject Subjects free discontinue participation study time , without prejudice treatment . Subjects discontinue study always ask reason ( ) discontinuation presence adverse event . If possible , see assessed investigator . Adverse event follow . Safety Evaluation : Once treatment phase initiate 30 day follow conclusion trial , subject question adverse event related administration S-citalopram . At final visit , 30 day conclusion trial , patient give full physical examination . Adverse experience document response non-leading question , `` Have felt different way since start new treatment since last visit ? '' In addition , adverse experience observe investigator volunteer spontaneously patient record . Any serious adverse event ( SAE ) report H. Lundbeck A/S contact person within 24 hour become aware . Serious Adverse Events meet least one follow indicator : 1 . Death 2 . Life threaten 3 . In patient hospitalization 4 . Persistent significant disability/ incapacity 5 . Congenital anomaly/birth defect 6 . Judged medically important Efficacy Evaluation : Primary efficacy parameter The primary objective follow : In individual SP , change intensity vasodilatory response 10 mM topical m-N measure association symptomatic improvement follow treatment S-citalopram 10 20 mg . The end point study period Week 16 . Secondary efficacy parameters The secondary objective follow end point study period Week 16 : 1 . Mean change baseline Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) ; Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ) , Social Phobia Inventory ( SPIN ) ; Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) ; Social Phobia Scale ( SPS ) final visit ; Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ( SIAS ) 2 . Mean change baseline fear blush scale : Blushing , Trembling , Sweating Questionnaire ( BTS-Q ) Propensity Scale ( BPS ) . 3 . Decreased level prostaglandin D2 observe association finding decrease m-N -induced flush SP population . Any significant difference level prostaglandin D2 metabolite three group ( treatment group control ) disappear symptom improvement SP group . 4 . Potential change peripheral serotonin synthesis tryptophan alter change level plasma serotonin correlate outcome flush response SP subject receive treatment . 5 . Mean change baseline Sheehan Disability Scale ( work , social life family life domain ) , Euroquol ( quality life ) Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , ) , Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) Trial Design : This randomize , double-blind flexible-dose study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability S-citalopram 10 20 mg placebo outpatient subject diagnose SP . After provide write informed consent screen visit , patient undergo test indicate determine suitability study . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion assign receive S-citalopram ( N = 18 ) placebo ( N = 18 ) . The initial dose S-citalopram 10mg . After week one , patient manage dose 10mg daily maximum 20mg . The dose may adjust first 8 week keep stable duration rest study . Patients see weekly week one 6 biweekly week 16 , necessary , telephone contact initiate Investigator study coordinator visit assess patient 's response therapy . Procedure Assessing Blushing/Vasodilation : Prior application m-N patch , 5 mm diameter circle relatively hairless , unblemished skin mask hypoallergenic medical tape . This area find subject ' inner forearm face ( center cheekbone - outside corner eye ) . Initially , five-minute baseline laser Doppler measurement take . Subsequently , 10 mM m-N patch apply skin area forearm face one minute remove . This follow 20-minute period blood flow measure continuously face arm . Vasodilatation measure use Moor Instruments moorLAB laser Doppler spectroscope adjust measure change cutaneous blood flow . The Laser Doppler flow meter take real time measurement local tissue blood flow reflect light move object red blood cell . Each measurement assign arbitrary unit ( Flux ) parameter base summed intensity reflection record instrument ( Moor Instruments Limited , 1998 ) . Flux sample 40 time per second transfer personal computer analysis . Subsequently , blood flow ( flux ) data average 30-second bin analyse undertaken use non-linear curve fit use software program Prism ( Graphpad software ) . The flux time [ F ( ) ] fit curve parameter F ( 0 ) , baseline flux , F , maximal plateau change flux , µ , maximal rate change , L , lag time apply test patch vasodilatation occur ( Equation 1 ) . Runs produce significant reaction ( define least one block 5 consecutive 30 second time period significantly ( Student 's t-test ; P &lt; 0.05 ) baseline blood flow ) assign F value zero ; µ L parameter calculate circumstance ) . Approximate half maximal dose ( EC50 ) value calculate use non-linear curve fit standard sigmoidal dose response curve use median F value derive dose m-N .</detailed_description>
