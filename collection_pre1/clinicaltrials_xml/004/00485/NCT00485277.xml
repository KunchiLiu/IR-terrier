	<brief_summary>The current trial , BNIT-BR-002 , evaluate safety biological activity fix dose MVA-BN®-HER2 , without Herceptin , follow 1st- 2nd-line chemotherapy patient Her-2-positive metastatic breast cancer . The intent vaccination induce anti-Her-2 immune response , antibody T cell , attack Her-2 expressing tumor , may induce tumor regression slow progression disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Immunology Study Modified Vaccinia Vaccine HER-2 ( + ) Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MVA-BN®-HER2 candidate breast cancer immunotherapy product comprise highly attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus , MVA-BN® , engineer encode modify form Her-2 protein . MVA-BN® well-characterized , clonal strain modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) develop smallpox vaccine , suitable use high-risk ( e.g. , immunocompromised ) individual . MVA-BN®-derived vector encode heterologous antigen develop use vaccine infectious disease HIV , treatment cancer . A large database exist safety evaluation animal human MVA-BN® , MVA-BN®-derived vector . Her-2 overexpressed 20-30 % human breast cancer . It oncogene/growth factor receptor critical malignant phenotype Her-2 expressing tumor . It immunogenic target , immune response protein show mediate potent anti-tumor activity multiple animal model . Means stimulate anti-Her-2 reactivity study clinically . Sponsor , collaborator , others use Protein DNA vaccine form Her-2 , safety database develop significant adverse event result Her-2 directed vaccination . MVA-BN®-HER2 encodes modify form Her-2 protein , hereinafter refer HER2 . HER2 contain extracellular domain Her-2 lack intracellular , cell signal domain . In addition , HER2 include two universal T-cell epitope tetanus toxin facilitate stimulation immune response Her-2 , self-protein . The current trial , BNIT-BR-002 , evaluate safety biological activity fix dose MVA-BN®-HER2 , without Herceptin , follow 1st- 2nd-line chemotherapy patient metastatic breast cancer overexpress Her-2 . Patients receive 3 subcutaneous vaccination 3 week interval tumor follow CT/MRI image blood drawn immune function analysis .</detailed_description>
