	<criteria>1 . Healthy adult Caucasian men nonpregnant , nonlactating woman 18 40 year age , inclusive . 2 . Healthy judge responsible physician clinically significant abnormality identify medical laboratory evaluation , include 12lead ECG vital sign . 3 . Nonsmoker previous 3 month . 4 . Body weight great equal 50 kg BMI within range 1929 kg/m2 , inclusive . 5 . At screen Runin period ECG : Consistent sinus rhythm , ( i.e . great equal 2 ECGs sinusal different time point volunteer include ) , No clinically significant conduction disorder , PR 120 230 m , HR le equal 100 beats/min great equal 40 beats/min , QRS &lt; 120 m , QT interval consistently analyse , QTcB le equal 430 m male , QTcB le equal 450 m female If outlying value ECGs , consistency value confirm follow : If HR 40 44 bpm ( inclusive ) 2 ECGs ( one triplicate ) one time point Runin , subject select . Conversely , mean HR 40 44 bpm screen and/or one timepointtriplicate Runin , volunteer select . If HR &lt; 40 bpm single occasion screen Runin period , subject select , If PR interval consistently outofrange ( &lt; 120 &gt; 230 m ) Runin period , i.e . 2 3 ECGs one time point one ECG one time point , cardiologist need perform manual measurement value . If manual measurement confirms PR outofrange , volunteer must select . If QRS consistently &gt; 120 m runin period , i.e . 2 ECGs triplicate 2 ECGs 2 different timepoints , cardiologist need perform manual measurement value . If manual measurement confirms QRS outofrange , volunteer must select . If QTcB range ( QTcB &gt; 430 m male &gt; 450 m female , repeat demonstration QTcB interval &gt; 440 m female ) even single occasion , check whether heart rate constant . If HR constant increase QTcB clearly due hysteresis ( e.g . immediate repeat ECG consistent HR QTcB back normal ) , volunteer select . If HR constant QTcB still outofrange , cardiologist need perform manual measurement calculation QTcB . If QTcB normal manual measurement , volunteer select . If QTcB abnormal manual measurement without acceptable cause , volunteer must select , even QTcB outlying one single ECG . The final decision include / include volunteer base protocol ECG criterion lie cardiologist assess Runin ECGs . 6 . Signed date write informed consent prior admission study . 7 . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction , protocolstated restriction . 8 . A female subject may enter study : Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 2 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g . appropriate age history vasomotor symptom . However ; indicate , confirm estradiol FSH level consistent menopause ( accord local laboratory range ) . Premenopausal females document hysterectomy ( medical report verification ) and/or bilateral oophorectomy . In case oophorectomy alone , acceptable reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment .

Clinically significant history family history congenital long QT syndrome ( e.g . RomanoWard syndrome , Jervell LangeNielson syndrome ) Brugada 's syndrome . 6 . History clinically significant arrhythmia ( especially ventricular arrhythmia , atrial fibrillation , recent conversion atrial fibrillation ) . 7 . Complete bundle branch block / sinus node dysfunction . 8 . Conditions predispose volunteer electrolyte imbalance ( e.g . alter nutritional state , chronic vomiting , anorexia nervosa , bulimia nervosa ) . 9 . Any pathology abnormality possible influence ECGs . 10 . Clinically significant dermatological disease include history druginduced skin rash . 11 . History clinically significant psychiatric illness . 12 . History gastrointestinal surgery except appendectomy , herniotomy cholecystectomy . 13 . History chronic inflammation gastrointestinal tract . 14 . History tendinopathy fluoroquinolone . 15 . Subjects vital sign measurement follow : Supine heart rate outside 40 100 beats/min range , Standing heart rate outside 40 125 beats/min range , Supine systolic blood pressure outside 80 140 mmHg range Supine diastolic blood pressure outside 40 95 mmHg range . 16 . Subjects symptomatic drop systolic blood pressure &gt; 20 mmHg diastolic &gt; 10 mmHg screening . 17 . A positive prestudy HIV 1 &amp; 2 antibody , Hepatitis B surface antigen , and/or Hepatitis C antibody result . 18 . Positive serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . 19 . Subjects confirm positive prestudy urine drug abuse / alcohol breath test . 20 . History evidence drug alcohol abuse within 18 month study start . 21 . Abuse alcohol define male average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ; female define average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit . One unit equivalent halfpint ( 220 mL ) beer 1 ( 25 ml ) measure spirit 1 glass ( 125 ml ) wine . 22 . Use prescribed medication two week baseline ECG day Period 1 use OTC drug ( include herbal remedy mineral ) week baseline ECG day Period 1 ( 14 day drug enzyme affect property ) , unless opinion Investigator Sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Use medication know carry risk cause Torsades de Pointes allow within 14 day 10 time elimination half life ( whichever longer ) baseline ECG day Period 1 . Use vitamins allow within 48 hour baseline ECG day Period 1 . Oral contraceptive drug woman childbearing potential occasional use paracetamol ( 2 g/day ) pain fever relief allow . 23 . History presence allergy study drug drug respective class , history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . 24 .
