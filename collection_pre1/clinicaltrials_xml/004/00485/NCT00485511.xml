	<brief_summary>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) autosomal recessive disorder human result loss motor neuron . It cause reduced level survival motor neuron ( SMN ) protein result loss mutation SMN1 gene . SMN protein encode two gene , SMN1 SMN2 , essentially differ single nucleotide exon 7 . As result , majority transcript SMN2 lack exon 7 . According clinical severity , SMA classify three type , include type I , type II , type III . Drugs capable modify transcription pattern SMN2 increase full-length SMN mRNA expression amount SMN protein may therapeutic effect SMA patient . In order test hypothesis , use EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line derive different type SMA patient screen effect various drug SMN2 gene expression . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) find effective among drug test . HU effective therapeutic agent patient thalassemia sickle cell disease toxicity minimal well-tolerated safely used child . We undergo small-scaled 33 SMA patient randomize pilot trial ( HU treatment 8 week follow drug-free 8 week ) evaluate effect HU SMA patient get promising preliminary data . We find HU could significantly increase manual muscle test score 4 week , full-length SMN mRNA level 30mg/kg/day subgroup 8 week relative baseline , safe dose 30mg/kg/day . In study , plan enroll 60 type II III SMA patient conduct single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , prospective trial two-year duration evaluate efficacy safety HU.The primary end point change full-length SMN expression , SMN protein , motor function lung function SMA patient . We also design safety monitoring system investigate adverse effect assure patient ' safety . We hope find prove efficacy safety HU SMA patient set evaluate model multi-center trial future .</brief_summary>
