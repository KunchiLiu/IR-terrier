	<detailed_description>Imatinib mesylate design block certain protein important growth cancer . Docetaxel design target destroy cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , take 4 imatinib mesylate tablet mouth day meal large glass water ( 8-10 ounce . ) A treatment cycle study 21 day . You keep normal eating habit , however low-fat breakfast recommend ( example , light continental breakfast toast juice ) . Foods drink contain caffeine grapefruit avoid . You wait least 1 hour take last tablet go bed . If vomiting occurs , take extra study medication . You give patient diary record take medication . You bring diary clinic visit , study nurse review time . Docetaxel give vein arm first day 21-day treatment cycle total 6 cycle . The infusion take 1 hour . You need take steroid ( dexamethasone ) receiving docetaxel try prevent fluid accumulation allergic reaction . You take dexamethasone mouth twice day day docetaxel infusion , day infusion , day infusion . You receive extra dose dexamethasone ( either needle vein mouth ) day infusion chemotherapy either needle vein mouth . Every 3 week study , physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight , performance status evaluation . During first 4 week , blood ( 3 teaspoon time ) drawn week routine test . After , blood ( 3 teaspoon time ) drawn Week 5 , Week 7 , every 3 week . In addition , tumor measure compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan every 6 week ( Weeks 7 , 13 , 19 ) . If develop intolerable symptom certain change blood test , treatment may delay and/or dose may decrease symptom go . It may even necessary stop treatment . You inform change dose schedule dos medication doctor evaluate clinic . You may receive 6 cycle study treatment . Your continued participation study depend cancer responds study drug . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect medical condition get bad . After complete treatment , end-of-study visit . At visit physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You performance status evaluation . You blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Your tumor measure CT MRI scan . This investigational study . Imatinib mesylate FDA approve docetaxel FDA approve type cancer however use together study investigational . Dexamethasone require give docetaxel . All three drug commercially available . Up 58 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
