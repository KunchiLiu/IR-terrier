	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate effectiveness VeinViewer® near infrared device facilitate placement intravenous catheter child require intravenous cannulation pediatric emergency department . This clinical protocol design determine whether use VeinViewer increase ease efficiency IV cannulation ( perceive operator ) , decrease time effective cannulation , decrease number stick extravasation , decrease child 's parent perception pain IV cannulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VeinViewer Assisted Intravenous Catheter Placement Pediatric Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle stick part many standard treatment pediatric emergency department ( ED ) frequently source pain anxiety child . Intravenous catheter ( IVs ) show among leading cause pain hospitalized child 1 venipucture commonly see one painful frequently perform invasive procedure nurse . 2 ( Jacobson et al . ) Children record VAS pain score response IV catheter placement Emergency Department rat pain 3.23/5.0 parent rat child 's pain 3.4/5.0 . 3 ( Skarbek et al . ) The placement intravenous catheter would efficient less stressful clinician clear roadmap picture highlight location vein . The lack clear visual guide IV placement often lead multiple painful attempt catheter placement well delay urgent treatment ( I.V . fluid medication administration ) increase use human resource . The current average number catheter puncture need order achieve successful catheter placement 2.4 range 1-14 . 4 ( Larue , GD ) The VeinViewer Luminetx™ allow clinician clearly see child 's accessible vasculature lack thereof real time , directly surface skin . The clinician trained operate VeinViewer minute use require additional job skill certification . The VeinViewer free stand hands-free allow clinician freedom use hand carry work placing catheter ( unlike ultrasound require one hand hold probe hand place catheter , unless two people available able coordinate work effort thus double resource necessary I.V . placement . The VeinViewer non-invasive cause tissue damage . There patient contact device therefore risk infectious disease contamination blood product . The VeinViewer use near-infrared light locate subcutaneous vein project location onto surface skin thus create visible roadmap I.V catheter placement . This protocol describe prospective , randomize , study , evaluate effectiveness VeinViewer increase ease intravenous cannulation child receive intravenous cannulation pediatric emergency department . The investigator hypothesize cannulation use VeinViewerâ require fewer stick result few miss repeat IV start , few extravasating ( `` blow vein '' ) IV placement , increase perceived ease placement operator , decrease pain associate IV placement perceive child , parent , operator . 2 . Background Intravenous cannulation routine common part treatment child receive care Pediatric Emergency Department . Intravenous cannulation painful often challenging child . Peripheral IV 's generally place use visual and/or tactile cue . These may minimal deceptive child often small peripheral vein increase subcutaneous fat opaque , elastic skin . Health care worker often struggle place IV 's successfully make multiple stick , infiltrate subcutaneous tissue , require extensive operator time , , importantly , cause patient parent distress . A number approach try , attempt decrease pain cannulation . Most involve cutaneous application lidocaine attempt numb skin decrease pain stick . EMLA recently , LMX ( lidocaine liposomal delivery system ) effective topical agent 30 minute dwell time - inappropriate Emergency Medicine setting . A number device test decrease barrier stratum corneum thus allow lidocaine anesthetize skin 3-5 minute . These include hand hold laser ( effective burn pigment skin ) , small ultrasound ( effective bulky difficult use ) , gas pressure drive powdered lidocaine ( effective approve FDA yet general sale distribution ) . These device depend identify vein successfully cannulate identify vein anestethized skin . Missed stick force operator begin anesthesia process different site . This process time consume ineffective ED setting . Other center begin employ ultrasound identify vein peripheral cannulation cannulate indirect visualization . This process difficult small mobile pediatric vein require extensive operator training practice . It also require extra set operator hand child , often less cooperative , involve . It unclear approach effective Pediatric ED . Vein Viewerâ hand device project map subcutaneous vein onto surface skin . It allow operator insert IV catheter direct visualization . It use one operator insert catheter restrain child 's arm use device . Direct visualization accurate decrease blind stick , miss `` fishing expedition '' , extravasation IV fluid medication ( often benign ) occur IV cannulation , especially child . Decreasing number stick time successful catheterization decrease child 's parent perceive pain procedure operator time effective catheterization thus increase efficiency operator ED general , speeding initiation therapy ( IV hydration medication ) . The Vein Viewer side effect visually interest child parent . It potential revolutionize effectiveness efficiency , IV cannulation Pediatric Emergency Department decrease substantially child 's parent 's perceive pain procedure fear procedure .</detailed_description>
