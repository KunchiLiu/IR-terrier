	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety efficacy autologous Vascular Repair Cells ( VRC ) patient peripheral arterial disease treatment critical limb ischemia . The double-blind study expect enroll 150 patient , randomize two patient group . The treatment group receive intramuscular ( IM ) injection VRCs affect limb ; control group receive intramuscular injection electrolyte solution ( without cell ) . Both group receive standard care appropriate medical condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study assess safety ability Aastrom TRC autologous bone marrow cell restore peripheral blood flow affect critical limb ischemia . Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , also know Peripheral Vascular Disease ( PVD ) , occur peripheral artery damage arterial hypertension and/or formation atherosclerotic plaque . PAD chronic disease progressively constrict arterial circulation limb . The term critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) use patient chronic ischemia rest pain , ulcer , gangrene limb attributable objectively proven PAD . These sequelae represent end stage PAD . PAD associate several clinical condition , i.e . hypertension , cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , tobacco use , obesity stroke . The double-blind study expect enroll 150 patient , randomize two patient group . The treatment group receive intramuscular injection TRC product affect limb ; control group receive intramuscular injection electrolyte solution ( without cell ) . Both group receive standard care appropriate medical condition .</detailed_description>
