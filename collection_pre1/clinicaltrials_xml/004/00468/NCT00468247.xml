	<detailed_description>Protocol No . AP2006-01 Study title : A Prospective , Open , Randomised , Multicentre , Controlled Group Study Assess Safety Efficacy Navigator versus Conventional Care Postoperative Cardiac Surgery Patients Undergoing Coronary Bypass Grafting Heart Valve Repair Replacement Utilizing Heart Lung Perfusion Pump . Acronym : NAV 1 Type study : Device Trial Sponsor : Applied Physiology Pty Ltd Study device : Navigator Guided Circulatory Care Management System Route Administration : Via Touch Panel Computer , externally connect bedside physiological monitor critical care environment Study centre : Six Australian centre Study design : Multicentre , open , randomise , control group study Total sample size : One hundred complete patient , 50 arm Study population : Post operative coronary bypass heart valve repair replacement patient admit Cardiac Intensive Care Intensive Care Unit . Surgery must involve use heart lung perfusion pump patient must function arterial line Swan Ganz catheter situ enable measurement Cardiac Output , Mean Arterial Pressure , Right Atrial Pressure . Study regimen : Following surgery , meet inclusion exclusion criterion , patient randomise admission ICU receive care guide Navigator conventional care ICU stay CO monitor . All patient connect Navigator ; screen patient control group graphical section blank , right hand side display actual value MAP , CO RAP slave bedside monitor , along patient 's screening randomisation number initial . The arm study patient randomise ; control/Navigator , also show . Endpoints : Primary : The primary efficacy endpoint average distance central point target cardiovascular zone period patient connect Navigator . Secondary : Secondary endpoint trial : - Percentage time target cardiovascular zone period patient connect Navigator - Clinically significant atrial fibrillation period patient connect Navigator . This define irregular supraventricular rhythm absence discrete P wave last ten minute document confirmed ECG - Multiple organ function , assess use SOFA score , calculate daily - Navigator device related adverse event device failure Statistical analysis : The primary secondary endpoint safety data analyse randomised Intention-to-treat population.The ITT population include individual randomise . The analysis compare primary efficacy endpoint two randomise treatment group use independent test . The secondary analysis compare secondary endpoint two randomise treatment group use independent t-tests , Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Study Period : From first pre-surgery screen visit post operative follow visit , approximately six week</detailed_description>
