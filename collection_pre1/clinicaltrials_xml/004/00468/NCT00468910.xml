	<brief_title>Aspirin Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients Increased Risk Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine whether acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) alter spectral marker ( i.e. , spectral slope fractal dimension ) distal colonic mucosa patient increase risk development recurrence colorectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess effect drug colonic epithelial apoptosis cell proliferation patient . II . Assess effect drug rectal prostaglandin level patient . III . Assess effect drug platelet cyclooxygenase activity patient . IV . Correlate change spectral marker UGT1A6 genotype patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify clinical site adenoma/carcinoma maximal size . Patients abnormal spectral biomarkers randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) daily . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue 3 month absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy biopsy well blood collection baseline ( prestudy colonoscopy ) completion study treatment comparison spectral signatures biomarkers aspirin activity ( include plasma cyclooxygenase activity rectal prostaglandin level ) well biomarkers associate antineoplastic alteration ( include apoptosis cell proliferation ) . UGT1A6 genotyping analysis also perform . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
