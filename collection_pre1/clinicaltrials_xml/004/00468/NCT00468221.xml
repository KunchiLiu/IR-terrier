	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn effect 0.12 ppm ozone exposure human . We know study exposure level ozone see bad air pollution day , cause increase risk illness even death people certain health problem like asthma heart disease . We also know study do lab even healthy people inflammatory ( increase amount bacteria fight cell ) response high level ozone . We suspect exposure low level ozone make body susceptible thing like allergen . For instance , person allergic pollen , exposure ozone environment may cause allergy symptom around pollen would expose ozone first . In study look find low level ozone healthy people expose without see increase immune response . We use 0.12 ppm ozone ; roughly amount ozone would expose `` yellow '' ozone day triangle area summer spend entire day door exercise moderately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low level endotoxin O3 report prime airway response stimuli , notable example immediate late phase response allergen . Likewise , epidemiological study indicate level O3 current air quality standard ozone still link exacerbation respiratory tract disease . On cellular level , endotoxin oxidant prime inflammatory cell response subsequently inhale stimulus enhance . This lead idea ozone may also enhance response endotoxin reverse . As show preliminary data , carefully examine response low level inhale endotoxin find dose 10,000 EU enhances phagocytic function macrophage , monocyte PMNs modifies expression cell surface receptor ( CD11b , CD14 ) , alter IL-13 level sputum without cause PMN influx airway . This study similar design , evaluate effect ozone low exposure level instead endotoxin . It think monocyte macrophage mediate response ozone macrophage recover airways person expose ozone blunt response stimuli opsonize zymosan ligand , vitro , exposure macrophage ozone likewise render hypo-responsive stimulus , include endotoxin . There general agreement airway response endotoxin mediate primarily action macrophage monocyte . However , monocytes undergo adaptation endotoxin previous challenge endotoxin , chronic presence endotoxin ( i.e . sepsis ) also induce tolerance effect additional exposure endotoxin . Thus , suppression monocyte/macrophage function ozone may adequate evidence cell participate ozone-induced airway inflammation . It also argue ozone cause epithelial cell generate mediator like IL-8 potent chemoattractant PMNs , response ozone primarily orchestrate cell . However , data support role macrophage response ozone . Also , epithelial cell produce stress-induced endogenous ligand , many know generate follow exposure ozone , could interact innate immune ( e.g.CD14 , TLR4 ) , complement ( e.g . CR3 ) receptors airway mononuclear cell . An initial experiment group show ozone challenge primary epithelial cell culture ( develop nasal epithelial sampling volunteer ) yield supernatant activate COX2 induce IL-6 secretion peripheral blood monocyte , indicate potential O3-induced , epithelial-derived monocyte ligand . To approach question whether low level exposure ozone modify airway phagocyte biology ( determine primarily cell surface marker expression , phagocyte function endotoxin responsiveness ) , study similar one detailed endotoxin volunteer ask undergo low level ozone exposure determine prim dose identified modifies monocyte biology sub-threshold induce neutrophil response airway . Exposure ozone low 0.12 ppm 1 hour without exercise may prime response allergen , yet otherwise effective dose induction inflammatory lung function change . 0.12 ppm O3 2 hour 1 hour intermittent exercise also yield airways inflammation result generation salicylate product volunteer dose aspirin propose marker O3 exposure . Using similar study guide , perform study volunteer undergo 0.12 ppm ozone exposure 2 hour moderate , intermittent exercise ( yield 35L/min ventilation total exercise duration 1hr ) . We examine sputum neutrophil level ( % PMNs PMN/mg sputum ) , cell surface marker expression ( CD11b , CD14 ) sputum blood inflammatory cell ( monocyte , macrophage ( sputum ) , phagocytosis cytokine response endotoxin stimulation , 6hr follow exposure ozone . We carry interim analysis complete study 6 volunteer determine identify level ozone likely modify mononuclear cell function without significant neutrophilia . If 0.12 ppm ozone 2 hour appear induce prim response , change PMN response modification monocyte biology , continue dose . If see increase PMNs , refocus protocol challenge volunteer 0.08 ppm O3 2 hour moderate exercise . If response macrophage level , would challenge volunteer 0.2 ppm 2 hour . Multiple study link ozone increase morbidity mortality . One possible explanation decrease heart rate variability ( HRV ) . In hospitalized patient , decrease HRV directly correlate increased mortality multiple condition . Recent study complete linked particulate matter decrease HRV . In study evaluate subject 's heart rate variability use ambulatory ECG monitoring . Hypotheses 1 . Low level ozone prime airway macrophages/monocytes responsive inflammatory stimulus , include endotoxin opsonize zymosan . 2 . Low level ozone enhance airway blood monocyte macrophage function , induce alteration cell surface marker .</detailed_description>
