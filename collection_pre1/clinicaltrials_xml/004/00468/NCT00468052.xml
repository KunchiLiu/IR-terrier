	<brief_summary>Pediatric tonsillectomy ( without adenoidectomy ) brief painful surgery carry child often also present obstructive sleep apnea . To provide pain relief , i.e . analgesia , current practice relies opioids , e.g. , morphine fentanyl . These narcotic know depress respiration increase incidence post-operative nausea vomit . These side effect worrisome patient cohort . An alternative medication , dexmedetomidine , may opiate spar effect high safety profile adult well sedation child . The purpose study determine intravenous dexmedetomidine give infusion general anesthesia tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy reduces incidence severity emergence agitation , improve analgesia reduces nausea vomit 60 minute follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decrease Emergence Agitation Provide Pain Relief Children Undergoing Tonsillectomy &amp; Adenoidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation ( EA ) general anesthesia frequent phenomenon child age 1-10 yr recover anesthesia demand increase nursing care PACU , delay reunion parent often cause dissatisfaction parent , may lead adverse sequela case physical harm child , particular site surgery ( 1 ) . Emergence agitation state non purposeful restlessness inconsolability . This state often accompany thrash , scream , prolong cry disorientation . Children generally unaware surroundings console caregivers/parents . It disturb parent observe behavior child . It also safety issue child staff . These negative effect EA motivate clinician investigate possible etiology potential treatment EA . EA may part due relative paucity inhibitory neurotransmitter child 's central nervous system ( CNS ) . As well , modern anesthetic design rapidly eliminate result abrupt change state anesthesia state responsiveness . The result difficult problem manage patient 30-50 minute period follow pediatric anesthesia . We propose study patient schedule tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy . Adenotonsillar hypertrophy may produce upper airway obstruction , dysphagia , dental malocclusion , alter orofacial growth , alter eustachian tube function , pulmonary hypertension cor pulmonale . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) associate loud snore sleep period respiratory pause terminate gasp agitate arousal suggest developmental consequence include ADHD , failure thrive , nocturnal enuresis ( 2 ) . Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome commonly associate adenotonsillar hypertrophy child present adenotonsillectomy ( 3 ) . Tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy highly successful eliminate OSA child consider first-line therapy family amenable specific contraindication , approximately 85-95 % effective eliminating OSA child ( 4 ) . All child undergo tonsillectomy adenoidectomy consider increase risk perioperative airway problem ( 5 ) . Opioids may cause respiratory depression , thus present add risk patient undergo tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy , especially child OSA ( 6 ) . The purpose study determine intravenous dexmedetomidine give infusion general anesthesia tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy reduces incidence severity emergence agitation 60 minute follow surgery compare normal practice . A second outcome whether need intra-operative postoperative analgesic narcotic medication reduce . Dexmedetomidine , specific alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist , recently study sedative , amnestic , analgesic property show effective providing sedation , decrease anesthetic requirement surgery postanesthesia care unit , reduction emergence agitation ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Dexmedetomidine show enhance analgesic action nitrous oxide furthermore also show effective total intravenous anesthetic agent certain patient dos increase high enough level , respiratory depression ( 10 , 11 ) . If dexmedetomidine show reduce eliminate emergence agitation , provide effective intraoperative postoperative analgesia without respiratory depression , would give anesthesiologist good option management patient undergo tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy . The dose regimen Dexmedetomidine load dose 1ug/kg continuous infusion 0.2-0.7 ug/kg recommend sedation Intensive Care Unit adult . There increase body experience use Dexmedetomidine pediatrics sedation reduce kg/hr . They observe mean decline heart rate ( HR ) blood pressure ( BP ) pre-sedation value 15 % , 70 % patient show decline 1-30 % . Despite drop HR BP , change still within clinical range normal age ( 10 ) . We propose 2 ug/kg load dose maintenance dose 0.7ug/kg/hr surgery , since intend use dexmedetomidine tonsillectomy adenotonsillectomy , surgery stimulate pain response surgery start soon patient intubated surgical preparation time . 2ug/kg high usual recommend dose , use child study without significant adverse event .</detailed_description>
