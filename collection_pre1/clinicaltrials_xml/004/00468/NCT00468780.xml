	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate reliability validity acuity estimate paramedic employ Canadian Triage Acuity Scale ( CTAS ) hospital set . The study potential help guide policy decision pertain safe transfer ambulance patient alternative destination reduce ED overcrowd ambulance load time . Emergency Department triage nurse employ acuity scale study successful emergency department EMS service could communicate capacity handle patient base acuity , volumes wait time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CTAS stand Canadian Triage Acuity Scale . CTAS define 5 level triage accord perceive need physician assessment . CTAS develop measure ED case mix evaluate potential effect change delivery health care patient seek emergency care . Although Canadian Institute Health Information ( CIHI ) collect data total visit , admission , ambulatory care visit , standard report data Emergency Departments . The Canadian Association Emergency Physicians endorse CTAS standardize data element ass compare case mix acuity . At present consistently utilized measure patient acuity perform paramedic Ontario . Information interface Prehospital Care Emergency Departments would inform decision-making Emergency Health Care system . The introduction CTAS provide superb opportunity evaluate utility provide information accurate consistent basis . The use acuity scale common in-hospital prehospital setting seem ideal . However , several question answer regard feasibility , reliability , safety validity CTAS widespread implementation . The Society Academic Emergency Medicine 's position clearly state , `` Patients may refer location receive care appropriate acuity problem triage criterion , , base research show safe effective '' . In prospective trial , Brillman et al . note 26-38 % emergency department patient admit hospital would identify triage even treat physician assess . If physician capable accurate triage decision , one must consider reliability paramedic challenge prehospital set . Moreover , recent high-profile coroner case suggest liability significant concern . Paramedics accustom point-of-care assessment triage , access resource utilized ED nurse . Because environment , context , discriminate tool , resource skill set differ triage nurse paramedic , essential evaluate use paramedic assessment tool determination accurate consistent CTAS score . Moreover yet emphasis paramedic assessment interfacing decision-making time care . It important ensure , therefore , prehospital application CTAS appropriate safe . The objective study evaluate criterion validity CTAS assignment paramedic departure scene arrival hospital compare CTAS expert ( gold standard ) , evaluate inter-rater reliability CTAS assignment paramedic arrival hospital compare triage nurse , evaluate predictive validity CTAS level assignment respect patient outcomes health care resource utilization describe relationship use return priority code CTAS category . A random sample Advanced Care Paramedic crew equal number randomly select Basic Care Paramedic crew five EMS system ( rural urban ) invite participate . A paramedic observer ( advanced basic ) advance CTAS skill observe crew , record critical element prehospital encounter data collection sheet assign CTAS level patient departure scene arrival hospital . The observer also record CTAS level return priority code convey paramedic dispatch centre , evaluate whether use return priority code ( urgent return assign value 4 ) CTAS score ( urgent call assign value 1 2 ) generate difficulty paramedic communication dispatch departure scene . At hospital , observer ensure triage nurse assigns CTAS level without prior knowledge paramedic assignment . The observer record CTAS level assign triage nurse well CTAS level departure scene arrival receive hospital , return priority code status change code record treat paramedic ambulance call report . The patient 's health insurance number ( HIN ) collect purpose linkage outcome data . The observer record time departure scene arrival hospital estimate transport interval . Validity measure calculate kappa statistic comparing observer 's ( gold standard ) CTAS score paramedic CTAS score departure scene arrival hospital . Inter-rater reliability CTAS medic ( assign arrival hospital ) triage nurse estimate use kappa statistic . The measure agreement estimate triage nurse observer . Agreement return priority code initially convey paramedic dispatch code record ACR evaluate use kappa statistic . The relationship CTAS score return priority code measure use descriptive statistic non-parametric correlation . The frequency call problem paramedic communication dispatch arise respect use CTAS return priority calculate type problem encounter described .</detailed_description>
