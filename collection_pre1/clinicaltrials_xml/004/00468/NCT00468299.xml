	<detailed_description>The optimal method treat Early Pregnancy Failure ( EPF ) certain . For many year , surgical management EPF treatment option . Now multiple study demonstrate effectiveness misoprostol treat EPF . Most study investigate medical treatment EPF evaluate efficacy one week . We find many woman want wait one week outcome medical treatment , want resolution sooner . This hampered widespread utilization medical therapy institution . We propose regimen medical treatment EPF expeditious follow-up . We want demonstrate relative efficacy two medication regimen treatment EPF perform randomize trial . One regimen 800μg buccal misoprostol alone regimen 200mg mifepristone , orally , addition 800μg buccal misoprostol , simultaneously . The primary outcome complete abortion rate 24hours medication administration . We hypothesize mifepristone improve complete abortion rate 24hrs . Secondary outcome include rate abortion medical treatment one week , indication surgical intervention , relationship progesterone level type pregnancy failure outcomes two group . Another secondary objective assess satisfaction treatment process conclusion pregnancy termination , 3 week begin process . The majority study investigate medical treatment EPF use vaginal misoprostol , buccal use increase . We use buccal misoprostol , widely use institution . We assess efficacy route administration well assess patient acceptability method .</detailed_description>
