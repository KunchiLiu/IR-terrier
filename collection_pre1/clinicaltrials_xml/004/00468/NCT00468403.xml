	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes commonly treat administration insulin , either multiple insulin injection continuous supply insulin wearable pump . Insulin therapy allow long-term survival individual type 1 diabetes ; however , guarantee constant normal blood sugar control . Because , long-term type 1 diabetic survivor often develop vascular complication , diabetic retinopathy , eye disease cause poor vision blindness , diabetic nephropathy , kidney disease lead kidney failure . Some individual type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia unawareness , life-threatening condition easily treatable medication characterize reduced absent warning signal hypoglycemia . For individual , transplantation pancreatic islet possible treatment option . Unfortunately , insulin independence among islet transplant recipient tend decline time . New strategy aim promote engraftment transplant islet need improve clinical outcome associated procedure . The purpose study determine safety efficacy islet transplantation , combine immunosuppressive medication regimen contain belatacept , treat type 1 diabetes individual experience hypoglycemia unawareness severe hypoglycemic episode . This study also seek improve understanding determinant success failure islet transplant type 1 diabetes . Eligible participant randomly assign study site-specific Phase 3 islet transplantation study ( CIT-07 ) . Participants study receive three separate islet transplant regimen immunosuppressive medication consist belatacept , basiliximab ( IL-2 monoclonal antibody receptor blocker ) , mycophenolate mofetil . Participants begin receive three drug day first islet transplant . Belatacept also administer Days 4 , 14 , 28 , 56 , 84 post-transplant every 4 week duration study . If participant receives daclizumab , also give Days 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 post-transplant ; participant receives basiliximab , also give Day 4 post-transplant . Mycophenolate mofetil also give duration study . Transplantations involve inpatient hospital stay intraportal infusion islet cell . Participants achieve maintain insulin independence Day 75 post-transplant consider second islet transplant . Participants remain dependent insulin longer 1 month second transplant show partial graft function consider third islet transplant . Participants meet criterion subsequent transplant function graft enter reduce follow-up period . There 25 study visit follow transplant . A physical exam , review adverse event , blood collection occur visit . A chest x-ray , abdominal ultrasound , electrocardiogram , quality life questionnaire , urine collection , extensive blood test occur visit . Participants also test blood glucose level least five time per day throughout study . A 24-month follow-up period take place participant 's last transplant .</detailed_description>
