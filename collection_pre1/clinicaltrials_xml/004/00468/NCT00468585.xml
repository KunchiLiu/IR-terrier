	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect ( good bad ) capecitabine breast cancer give novel schedule combination antibody therapy , bevacizumab . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) anticancer drug approve FDA 1998 treat metastatic breast cancer . Capecitabine pill block way cancer cell multiply grow . Usually , medicine take twice day fourteen day row . Patients get break drug seven day . With schedule usual dose , patient capecitabine experienced side effect interfere daily comfort.Different dos schedule capecitabine study animal study people colon cancer . Mathematic modeling use well understand results.Information experiment lead u ask 7 day treatment capecitabine follow 7-day break safer active breast cancer . The study consider first step direction design demonstrate safety activity . Bevacizumab biologic therapy target growth blood vessel tumor need grow . Women whose breast cancer spread part body live longer without cancer grow treated bevacizumab chemotherapy . Bevacizumab test 14-day/7-day schedule capecitabine . These two medicine safe give together seem work well breast cancer capecitabine alone . This study design answer question : 1 . What side effect bevacizumab capecitabine give different schedule often occur ? 2 . When give schedule , capecitabine bevacizumab help treat breast cancer spread continue grow despite treated chemotherapy drug ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Biweekly Capecitabine Dosing With Bevacizumab Treatment Metastatic Breast Cancer Based Upon Norton-Simon Mathematical Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Primary Objectives : • To estimate efficacy every week capecitabine bevacizumab patient metastatic breast cancer term overall response rate ( complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) ) administer MTD capecitabine determine phase I portion trial . B . Secondary Objectives : - To estimate secondary efficacy endpoint combination include clinical benefit ( CR+PR+SD &gt; 6 month ) , time tumor progression ( TTP ) , progression free survival ( TTP ) duration response . - To evaluate toxicity rate associated capecitabine schedule combination bevacizumab use NCI CTC ( version 3 ) Hand-Foot Syndrome Grading Scale develop Roche Laboratories , Inc. - To evaluate pharmacogenetics capecitabine breast cancer patient assess impact specific candidate SNPs toxicity and/or response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient ( male female ) diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast confirm MSKCC either histology cytology . Clinical evidence metastatic breast cancer , nonamenable surgery radiation therapy curative intent . Presence least one measurable metastatic lesion accord RECIST criterion irradiate ( i.e . newly arise lesion previously irradiate area accept ) . Ascites , pleural effusion , bone metastasis consider measurable . Minimum indicator lesion size : great equal 10 mm measure spiral CT great equal 20 mm measure conventional technique . Any number prior endocrine biologic therapy permit trial . In addition , patient may untreated metastatic setting receive number prior cytotoxic regimen . All previous chemotherapy must discontinue least 3 week prior study entry . All acute toxic effect ( exclude alopecia neurotoxicity ) prior therapy must resolve NCI CTC ( Version 3 ) Grade le equal 1 . Endocrine therapy aromatase inhibitor , SERM ( ie , tamoxifen ) fulvestrant permit within 4 week study entry , however concurrent therapy drug acceptable . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . Patients must either HER2negative HER2positive long candidate trastuzumab therapy . HER2negative define 0 1+ stain immunohistochemistry FISH negative gene amplification . HER2positive define 3+ stain immunohistochemistry FISH positive gene amplification . Age great equal 18 year old . Baseline laboratory data within follow limit : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L Estimated creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min CockcroftGault equation Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper normal limit ALT , AST &lt; 2.5x upper normal limit ( &lt; 5x upper normal limit case liver metastasis ) Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x upper normal limit ( &gt; 5x upper normal limit case liver metastases &gt; 10x upper normal limit case bone disease ) Serum urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential Negative within 14 day start treatment Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Patients reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective method contraception continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Life expectancy &lt; 3 month . Serious , uncontrolled , concurrent infection . Any prior fluoropyrimidine therapy exception adjuvant administration . Adjuvant fluoropyrimidine contain therapy must complete least 6 month prior enrollment . Prior severe reaction fluoropyrimidine therapy , know hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil . A history DPD deficiency exclude patient trial . Completion previous chemotherapy regimen &lt; 3 week prior start study treatment . Prior adjuvant hormonal therapy permit . Use aromatase inhibitor , antiestrogen fulvestrant must discontinue prior treatment start . Biologic therapy ( eg , bevacizumab , trastuzumab ) treatment metastatic disease must discontinue &gt; 3 week start protocol treatment . HER2positive patient candidate treatment trastuzumab exclude trial concurrent use trastuzumab may confound study result . History prior malignancy follow exception : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission ( evidence disease ) five year . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic etc ) would preclude study therapy drug . Specifically exclude follow cardiac condition : Inadequately control hypertension ( define blood pressure &gt; 150/100 mmHg antihypertensive medication ) Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month Significant vascular disease symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Capecitabine contraindicate patient creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min.Patients creatinine clearance le 50 ml/minute Cockroft Gault Equation exclude trial . Patients symptomatic CNS metastasis remain untreated radiation therapy exclude trial . The presence asymptomatic brain metastasis brain metastases previously irradiate ground trial exclusion phase I study however , patient exclude phase II portion trial . History uncontrolled seizure , central nervous system disorder psychiatric disability judge investigator clinically significant , preclude informed consent , interfere compliance oral drug intake . Other severe , acute chronic , medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result .
