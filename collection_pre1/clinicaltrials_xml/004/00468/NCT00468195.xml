	<brief_summary>The purpose cardiovascular image research look way improve way look picture heart . Patients undergo CT scan heart variety reason , include symptom and/or test suggestive coronary artery disease ( chest pain , shortness breath , abnormal stress test , follow exam known/existing coronary disease , abnormal calcium score , etc . ) This study involve find way optimize quality scan person size . This patient BMI ( body mass index ) great 40 , usually difficult `` see '' artery around heart satisfactorily . Body mass index number get put height weight formula . The purpose study use new computer software program help u interpret heart study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Image Quality Obese Patients Undergoing Coronary Computed Tomography ( CT ) Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity one several know risk factor develop CAD.The CT technology use multitude important application around world , many study establish high accuracy detection specific coronary stenosis ( blockage artery heart ) compare non-invasive modality invasive coronary angiography , heart catheterization . The accuracy coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) detect coronary disease , compare cardiac catheterization demonstrate previous study perform William Beaumont Hospital . Several factor contribute quality image see CTA , include heart rate respiration . Overweight obesity also factor influence image quality due low signal noise ratio `` noisy image '' . There study examine use various technique improve image quality high-risk population patient . Recent advance multi-detector compute tomography angiography make noninvasive technique diagnosis coronary artery disease possible . Multi-detector compute tomography ( MDCT ) offer great promise risk stratification tool patient suspect CAD . It demonstrate multitude accuracy study negative predictive value average 95 % . This lead hypothesis negative MDCT may preclude need invasive testing . The purpose study develop optimal way image obese patient without present increase risk .</detailed_description>
