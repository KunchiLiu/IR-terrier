	<brief_summary>This survey two aim . First , would like informed health condition patient two year follow heart surgery University Hospital , Basel . Second , interested determine whether patient 's long-term outcome predict analysis blood sample take shortly heart surgery.Troponin T , blood parameter interested , routinely assess Intensive Care Unit . The purpose survey determine whether also possible infer long-term outcome blood parameter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prognostic Value Troponin T Long-term Outcome After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis purpose : The primary hypothesis study amount troponin T release cardiac surgery associate mortality cardiac morbidity within 1 year surgery . Patients undergo coronary procedure use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) ( i.e. , CABG , valvular combine on-pump procedure ) analyse . A purpose study evaluate outcome patient undergoing cardiac procedure institution , currently quantify . Study design : After ethical approval , conduct study two part . In first part , perform retrospective cohort study University Hospital Basel assess 1 year outcome patient undergone cardiac surgery institution January 1 , 2005 December 31 , 2006 . In addition , identify best cut-off value postoperative troponin T predict morbidity mortality 1 year open-heart surgery . The second part study perform January 1 , 2007 December 31 , 2008 . We continue quality control study prospectively test clinical value elevate troponin T value , accord risk model develop first part , predict long-term ( 1 year ) morbidity mortality . The prospective part study include patient operate early January 1 , 2007 prospective follow-up take place 12 month surgery . Patient selection : Inclusion criterion : patient underwent undergo cardiac surgery use cardio-pulmonary bypass University Hospital Basel January 1 , 2005 December 31 , 2008 eligible . For first part study , patient cardiac surgery January 1 , 2005 December 31 , 2006 analyse retrospectively . For prospective part study , patient study surgery January 1 , 2007 December 31 , 2008 . Exclusion criterion : - Cardiac surgery without use cardiopulmonary bypass - Procedures require circulatory arrest - Penetrating cardiac trauma - Lack informed consent . Baseline variable : Relevant patient data include : history , functional state , medication , EuroSCORE8 , haematological , basic renal , hepatic metabolic chemistry finding ( routinely perform preoperative laboratory test institution , include preoperative C-reactive protein troponin T presence recent ( &lt; 7 day ) ACS collect retrospective well prospective cohort . Pre-operative 12-lead ECG analyse prospective cohort . Peri-operative surgical clinical variable : Surgical procedure technique , operative data ( operating time , blood loss , cardiopulmonary cross-clamp time , number arterial venous graft number distal anastomosis ) assess . Early postoperative therapy event intensive care unit , include total time mechanical ventilation , postoperative inotropic support , blood transfusion renal replacement therapy , lengths intensive care unit hospital stay , re-operation , new onset ventricular arrhythmia Q-wave PMI record part study study . Cardiac marker analyse 12-lead ECG : Troponin T level , routinely measure first second postoperative day , use analysis part study . Also , routinely register 12-lead ECG discharge compare preoperative baseline ECG evaluate ischemic change accord Minnesota criterion Q- R-waves well ST-deviation T-wave change prospective cohort . Clinical endpoint : Primary endpoint : All-cause mortality within one year surgery . Secondary endpoint : Major adverse cardiac event , define cardiac mortality , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure require hospitalisation need surgical percutaneous coronary intervention within 1 year . The outcome measure obtain review hospital chart direct telephone contact patient . Sample Size : For retrospective part , anticipate sample size 1000 patient plan study period 24 month . Estimating 1-year mortality 6 % , expect 60 adverse event . This number adverse event allow statistically robust multivariate risk model base 6 variable . We assume sample size 660 patient allow retesting model prospective part study . Statistical Analysis : Analyses perform whole cohort well separately patient type cardiac surgery , i.e. , patient undergo CABG , aortic valve surgery , mitral valve surgery , combine surgery ( CABG plus valve surgery ) patient recent ( &lt; 7 day ) ACS surgery . Continuous data present mean ± SD comparison group calculate unpaired t-test . Categorical data present absolute number percentage comparison calculate Pearson 's χ2 test . Receiver operate characteristic curve compute establish cut-off value troponin T likelihood ratio outcome measure . Multivariate logistic regression use adjust association troponin T elevation outcome establish clinical risk parameter . This risk model , develop retrospective first part study , thereafter retested prospective second part . A p value &lt; 0.05 define point significance . All analysis calculate SPSS Version 14 .</detailed_description>
