	<brief_summary>In clinical study contrast agent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , already approve application adult , investigate child adolescent . MRI modern safe examination method without deliver radiation burden use magnetic field produce cross-sectional image human body . A special computer program put image together creates two three-dimensional image inner organ thus facilitate detection evaluation pathological change . In contrast-enhanced MRI contrast agent inject peripheral vein examination result strong contrast examine area . Therefore , pathological change easily detect evaluated compare non-enhanced MRI . The company Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals develop contrast agent MRI call Gadavist 1.0 first approved 1998 Switzerland MRI brain spine . Since 2003 Gadavist also use magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) adult , i.e . MRI examination blood vessel since 2006 MRI liver kidney disease . Gadavist examine 2,900 adult within framework clinical study development use marketing authorization meanwhile 600,000 patient . Yet , clinical study investigate Gadavist conduct adult far . Diseases require MRI examination , however , often occur child , . Therefore , many contrast agent already use regular basis MRI examination child , contrast agent authorize already . Within framework study pharmacokinetic characteristic Gadavist child adolescent investigate , i.e . contrast agent distribute behaves body . In addition , safety tolerability evaluate order demonstrate Gadavist 1.0 safe well tolerate contrast agent also child adolescent . Furthermore , study aim obtain dosage recommendation 0.1 ml per kilogram body weight also population group .</brief_summary>
