	<brief_summary>Approximately 50 % middle-aged patient severe AGHD normal age-related serum IGF-I . It remain unclear individual serum IGF-I GH dependent independent . This study compare relationship GH serum IGF-I two cohort male patient severe AGHD ; one normal subnormal age-related serum IGF-I value . The GH receptor antagonist - pegvisomant use specifically inhibit GH action change marker GH axis , serum IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , GH GHBP measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase reliance serum insulin-like factor-I ( IGF-I ) management disturbance growth hormone ( GH ) axis . IGF-I predominantly , exclusively , regulate GH secrete pituitary , majority circulate IGF-I hepatic origin . In parallel age-related decline GH secretion , circulate level IGF-I fall age ( 1 ) . For give GH level woman low serum IGF-I level men , indicative relative GH resistance ( 1,2 ) . Nutrition-related factor know affect GH , IGF-I relationship . Obesity associate low GH production , increase GH sensitivity result relatively high IGF-I give GH ( 3-6 ) . Deprivation important nutrient fast know stimulate GH , whilst reduce IGF-I ( 7-9 ) . In vitro study demonstrate complex role insulin IGF-I generation . Insulin stimulate hepatic IGF-I production directly increase IGF-I mRNA synthesis indirectly enhance effect GH ( 10,11 ) . By decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 2 ( IGFBP1-2 ) , insulin may also affect bioavailability IGF-I ( 12-13 ) . In acromegaly , IGF-I important marker diagnosis monitor disease activity . If patient treat GH receptor antagonist , IGF-I become useful biochemical marker monitor disease activity . GH deficiency adult associate increased morbidity ( 14-16 ) . In patient pituitary disease great progress recognition treatment disorder . There increase awareness GH deficiency , complication long-recognised cause hypopituitarism , also set traumatic brain injury subarachnoid haemorrhage ( 17 ) . The phenotype severe adult GHD describe many feature lack specificity biochemical confirmation diagnosis necessary . The Port Stevens consensus severe adult GHD rely measurement stimulate GH secretion confirmation diagnosis peak GH &lt; 3 µg/L , one two stimulation test , depend number pituitary hormone deficiency ( 18 ) GH replacement therapy rely measurement serum IGF-I dose titration , biochemical goal place circulate IGF-I within age- gender-related reference range , preferably 0 +1 SDS ( 19 ) . The Port Stephens consensus recognise apparent paradox approximately 50 % middle-aged patient diagnose severe GHD peak stimulate GH level &lt; 3 µg/L pre-treatment IGF-I within reference range . In untreated severe GHD adult onset predominately men , serum IGF-I may even upper half reference range . In word , treatment patient already IGF-I would regard satisfactory response GH replacement therapy . Prima facia , difficult reconcile serum IGF-I within reference range diagnosis GHD . Inevitably , pose question factor GH regulate circulate IGF-I level patient . Pegvisomant GH analogue bind , activate GH receptor show normalise IGF-I 97 % patient acromegaly ( 20 ) . We use pegvisomant study relationship GH IGF-I patient severe adult GHD investigate whether IGF-I patient , particularly GH-dependent .</detailed_description>
