	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomized multicenter trial compare MSCT standard care ( SOC ) diagnostic treatment triage Emergency Department ( ED ) low intermediate risk chest pain patient . Our hypothesis compare SOC treatment , MSCT equally safe diagnostically effective , well time cost efficient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Computed Tomography Systematic Triage Acute Chest Pain Patients Treatment ( CT-STAT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed tomography ( CT ) `` cat scan '' x-ray test routinely use diagnostic purpose . Heart ( `` Cardiac '' ) CT , use new scanner , improve way look coronary artery , supply blood heart muscle . If artery clog may cause chest pain even heart attack . The image coronary artery obtain CT scanner ( 5-10 minute procedure ) show many study accurate , compare conventional invasive cardiac catheterization procedure . In addition , least five prior study do different hospital suggest cardiac CT scan effective diagnose chest pain like patient come emergency room . What new study do multiple hospital time . This part process medical advance must go become part routine care patient hospital throughout country . A standard chest pain workup typically do emergency department consist physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKGs ) , several blood test . Blood test typically complete include cardiac enzyme ( Troponin , CK &amp; CK-MB ) , kidney function test , pregnancy test applicable , possibly lipid panel , depend physician preference . For test , 3mL vial fill specimen blood process laboratory result . Also two-part `` rest-stress '' nuclear scan typically perform , compare blood flow heart tissue rest blood flow heart tissue exercise dilation medication . Based prior study , researcher present study believe CT scan coronary artery provide information safe accurate rest-stress nuclear scan , rapidly low cost .</detailed_description>
