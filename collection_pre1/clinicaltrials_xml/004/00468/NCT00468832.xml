	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish large long-term assessment people Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) . In study , investigator associate Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group CINRG ) take detailed look ( minimum eight year ) DMD participant 's physical ability , medical problem experience , use health care service . Physical ability compare group healthy control . The second purpose study find whether small , normal difference genetic makeup people DMD ( call `` single nucleotide polymorphism '' `` SNPs '' ) affect disease progress relate muscle strength/size steroid response . The third purpose study study genetic variation associate DMD . The final purpose study determine whether certain biomarkers present people DMD healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phenotyping Study Aims Aim 1 : Longitudinally ass body function body structure ( impairment ) measurement anthropometrics , muscle strength pulmonary function subject DMD multicenter CINRG network . Aim 2 : Longitudinally assess activity limitation subject DMD CINRG time motor performance , burden care , functional status . Aim 3 : Longitudinally ass secondary condition subject DMD , relative risk develop condition base exposure preventive intervention . Aim 4 : Longitudinally assess participation , life satisfaction , service utilization health-related quality life subject DMD . Aim 5 : Determine appropriate outcome measurement impairment , activity ( activity limitation ) , participation quality life determine effect prednisone therapeutic intervention factor . Aim 6 : Using robust impairment , activity , participation quality life outcome measure , determine sample size , power statistical method analysis effect size future plan randomized-controlled rehabilitation intervention DMD . Aim 7 : Examine association intervention incidence severity secondary condition , achievement disease milestone measure motor function mobility . Aim 8 : To assess validity responsiveness novel clinical outcome measure DMD , include 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , 9-hole peg test ( 9-HPT ) Egen Klassification Scale ( EK ) , North Star Ambulatory Assessment ( NSAA ) , quantitative key pinch grip strength test . Aim 9 : To assess reliability , validity responsiveness novel patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) measure DMD , include NeuroQOL PedsQL Neuromuscular Module . Aim 10 : To assess clinical meaningfulness novel objective clinical outcome measure assess ability predict milestone loss ability stand supine , stand seat position , climb stair , ambulate independently raise hand mouth . AIM 11 : To determine impact development growth outcome measure performance , assess physical function group healthy , typically develop male child adult 6 30 year age outcome measure motor function strength include the9-HPT , 6MWT , NSAA , time function test quantitative muscle strength ( QMT ) . Test result cohort use develop initial percent predict age value assessment . SNP Genotyping Study Aim Our goal propose study define polygenic modifier disease progression , also response treatment glucocorticoid ( prednisone deflazacort ) . The common type human genetic variation single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP , base position two alternative base occur appreciable frequency ( &gt; 1 % ) population . SNPs 90 % variation human genome . SNPs occur average 1 per 1000 2000 bp throughout 3.2 billion bp human genome cod region SNPs ( cSNPs ) occur average 1 per 346 bp . Genome-wide Association Study Aim Our goal propose study isolate genomic DNA find possible correlation clinical phenotype gene loci associate mild vs. severe clinical presentation , progression , response steroid . Serum Biomarkers Study Aim Our goal discover validate sensitive specific serum biomarkers DMD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DMD Subject Inclusion Criteria Affected subject must male age 2 30 Affected subject age 2 4 must diagnosis DMD confirm least one follow OR old male sibling meet least one follow criterion : Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot show complete dystrophin deficiency , clinical picture consistent typical Duchenne dystrophy OR Gene deletion test positive ( miss one exon ) central rod domain exon 2560 ) dystrophin , read frame predict 'outofframe ' , clinical picture consistent typical Duchenne dystrophy . Complete dystrophin gene sequence show alteration ( point mutation , duplication , ) expect preclude production dystrophin protein ( i.e . nonsense mutation , deletion/duplication lead downstream stop codon ) , typical clinical picture DMD . Affected subject age 5 30 must either fulfill criterion OR show evidence dystrophinopathy clinical picture consistent Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Participants document clinical symptom referable dystrophinopathy direct support diagnosis either ( 1 ) positive DNA analysis dystrophin mutation , ( 2 ) muscle biopsy demonstrate abnormal dystrophin , ( 3 ) elevate CK ( &gt; 5X normal ) , Xlinked pedigree affect family member meet either criterion ( 1 ) ( 2 ) describe . NOTE : Determination appropriate clinical symptom consistent DMD generally responsibility clinician . At minimum include progressive loss function , additional consideration clinical feature characteristic gait , positive Gower sign calf pseudohypertrophy . When immunostaining muscle biopsy use determine case definition , clinical reviewer ( site PI ) confirm appropriate testing rule secondary deficiency dystrophin . Affected subject exhibit symptom consistent DMD exclude . Muscle weakness prevalent 5 year age Nonaffected adult subject must Parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) eligible affected subject .
