	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate biomarkers measure exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) purpose assess clinical strategy harm reduction . It take advantage recently develop device permit collection exhale breath condensate reproducibly , minimal subject effort oral contamination . The major goal trial provide evidence validate biomarkers EBC . This accomplish collect sample asymptomatic smoker induce change smoking habit ( cessation reduction ) aid partial nicotine replacement . Measures make EBC include H2O2 , widely explore biomarker `` body '' fluid . Methods reliably quantify level normal non-smokers asymptomatic smoker use . Two fold increase smoker report several report confirm preliminary data investigator . In addition , biomarkers oxidant stress : TBARs , 8-isoprostane nitrotyrosine quantify use standard method . Biomarkers quantify EBC assess reliability ( i.e . reproducibility sensitivity ) change validity ( comparison clinically define endpoint previously validate measure exposure ) . Reproducibility assess make repeated measurement subject different occasion . Sensitivity change assess compare value change smoke habit . Finally , validity biomarkers assess compare previous measure smoke exposure ( CO , NNAL NNAL-glc ) clinically defined endpoint : symptom , St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire post bronchodilator lung function . With regard latter measure , preliminary data indicate symptom detect `` asymptomatic '' smoker change harm reduction strategy .</brief_summary>
