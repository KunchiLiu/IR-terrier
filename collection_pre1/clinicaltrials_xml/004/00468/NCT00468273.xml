	<detailed_description>This open label , single-arm , prospective , multi-center , uncontrolled Phase III clinical study evaluate efficacy , pharmacokinetics safety Omr-IgG-am™ patient primary immunodeficiency disease . Approximately 50 subject enrol 16 Months : screening- 1 month treatment-12 month follow-up-3 month Subjects infuse every 21 28 day accord previous IVIG treatment schedule . Subjects treat every 28 day receive 13 study IGIV infusion . Subjects treat every 21 day receive 17 study IGIV infusion . We record incidence acute infection , especially acute serious bacterial infection , year subjet study . We record incidence adverse event occur infusion 48 hour infusion . At time study explain subject , investigator ask subject whose body weight 37 kg ( great define local standard ) willingness participate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) portion study . This involve 4 additional visit 5th 6th study IGIV infusion order draw blood sample analysis .</detailed_description>
