	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes commonly treat administration insulin , either multiple insulin injection continuous supply insulin wearable pump . Insulin therapy allow long-term survival individual type 1 diabetes ; however , guarantee constant normal blood sugar control . Because , long-term type 1 diabetic survivor often develop vascular complication , diabetic retinopathy , eye disease cause poor vision blindness , diabetic nephropathy , kidney disease lead kidney failure thus kidney transplant . Some individual type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia unawareness , life-threatening condition easily treatable medication characterize reduced absent warning signal hypoglycemia . For individual , pancreas pancreatic islet transplantation possible treatment option . The purpose study assess benefit islet transplantation type 1 diabetic kidney transplant recipient . Participants study type I diabetics received kidney transplant ESRD.. If subject receive ITT 12 month prior enrollment , must undergo period standardize diabetes care experienced diabetologist transplant center use current ADA 's standard medical care diabetes . Throughout study , participant remain immunosuppressive therapy intend kidney . Participants receive three separate islet transplant regimen immunosuppressive medication consist antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) etanercept . They begin receive ATG 2 day prior transplant continue receive ATG Day 2 post-transplant . Etanercept give day transplant Days 3 , 7 , 10 post-transplant . Transplantations involve inpatient hospital stay infusion islet branch portal vein . Participants achieve maintain insulin independence Day 30 post-transplant consider second islet transplant . Participants remain dependent insulin longer 30 day second transplant show partial graft function consider third islet transplant . Daclizumab use place ATG second third transplant , necessary . Participants meet criterion subsequent transplant enter reduce follow-up period . There approximately 15 study visit . A physical exam , review adverse event , blood collection occur visit . A chest x-ray , abdominal ultrasound , electrocardiogram , quality life questionnaire , urine collection occur visit . Participants also test blood glucose level throughout study . A 36-month follow-up period take place participant 's last transplant , consist 8 additional visit .</detailed_description>
