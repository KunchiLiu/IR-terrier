	<detailed_description>Ragweed MATAMPL develop Allergy Therapeutics provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy patient prove type I hypersensitivity cross react ragweed pollen cause rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis without mild moderate asthma bronchiale . An early formulation Ragweed MATAMPL develop Allergy Therapeutics ( UK ) , Ltd , available commercially Canada since 1980 's , 'Pollinex®-R ' . 'Pollinex®-R ' formulate modify allergen ( allergoids ) ragweed pollen extract adsorb onto L tyrosine 4 % w/v . Related formulation develop ATL , available commercially select European country since 1970´s Named Patient Basis , 'Pollinex Tree ' , 'Pollinex Grass ' , 'Pollinex Quattro Trees ' ( previously know MATA tree + MPL ) , 'Pollinex Quattro Grass ' ( previously know MATA grass + MPL ) . Ragweed MATAMPL contain extract ragweed pollen . This extract chemically modify glutaraldehyde produce active ingredient , allergoid . Such modification reduces reactivity extract IgE antibody . However , simultaneous reduction important immunological property , IgG T cell reactivity see . The modified extract adsorb L-tyrosine depot formulation . MPL® , purify , detoxify glycolipid derive cell wall Salmonella minnesota , also include current product formulation . This excipient/adjuvant include increase immunogenic effect product enhance switch allergen-specific TH2 TH1-like T cell profile . The current formulation design provide product efficacious 4 injection , contrast longer schedule currently use unmodified extract . The product also safer use formulation contain similar mass unmodified allergen extract regard ability cause severe local allergic reaction anaphylaxis , reduced reactivity IgE antibody . The modification great 75 % , small amount unmodified allergen remain product . The purpose study compare efficacy Ragweed MATAMPL versus placebo ragweed-allergic subject follow 4 subcutaneous injection study medication administer start 2007 ragweed pollen season .</detailed_description>
