	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Safety Immunogenicity MVA85A Healthy Gambian Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : The study non-randomized clinical trial . Twelve volunteer recruit . They would give 5x107 pfu MVA85A vaccine intradermally . The subject require stay unit hour vaccination . Local systemic adverse event would record . Blood sample take screen visit , day immunisation , 1 week vaccination , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 week vaccination . Screening : Details study carefully discuss subject informed consent approve combined MRC/Gambian government ethic committee prior study-related evaluation perform . The subject agree enroll sign consent documentation assess AFTBVAC clinic MRC . Entry Subjects recruit MRC AFTBVAC clinic . Subjects screen eight week prior enter study . The screen consist check subject eligibility full physical examination . The following carried : height , weight , vital sign , haematology ( haemoglobin , pack cell volume , white cell count , platelet , blood film malaria parasite ) , serum chemistry ( electrolytes creatinine , liver enzymes , serum bilirubin protein ) , Mantoux test , ELISPOT , Chest X-ray , anti-vaccinia antibody , anti-HBV antibody , , anti-HIV antibody , urinalysis . All chest X-rays review two clinician confirm radiological sign Tuberculosis . Evaluations study : Scheduled follow-up : Vaccination Day 0 : pysician confirm volunteer ESAT-6 CFP-10 nagative . The following assessment perform pre-dosing : vital sign ( 20 minute pre-dose ) blood sample collect heamatology ( haemoglobin , pack cell volume , white cell count , platelet , blood film malaria parasite ) , serum chemistry ( electrolytes creatinine , liver enzymes , serum bilirubin protein ) immunological assay . Provided vital sign satisfactory , subject receive first vaccination . Subjects dress applied injection site , remain least one hour vaccination . Post vaccination vital sign take 30 60 minute . Any adverse event ( AEs ) note study personnel describe volunteer document . Concomitant medication give document . The volunteer remain clinical area one hour follow vaccination allow return home . Day 1 2 : On first second day vaccination subject visit home field worker return clinical area . The injection site examine subject question AEs use concomitant medication . Day 7 : Subjects visit home field worker return clinical area . Vital sign assessment perform . Blood sample take haematology ( haemoglobin , pack cell volume , white cell count , platelet , blood film malaria parasite ) , serum chemistry ( electrolytes creatinine , liver enzymes , serum bilirubin protein ) immunological assay . The injection site examine subject question AEs concomitant medication . At day 14 , 28 , 56 , 84 189 , subject return clinical area . Vital sign assessment perform . Blood sample take prior dose haematology ( haemoglobin , pack cell volume , white cell count , platelet , blood film malaria parasite ) , serum chemistry ( electrolytes creatinine , liver enzymes , serum bilirubin protein ) immunological assay . The injection site examine subject question AEs concomitant medication . Day 22 23 : On first second day vaccination field worker visit subject home return clinical area . The injection site examine subject question AEs concomitant medication . Post study Evaluations : The injection site examine subject ask AEs . It possible asked future provide sample genetic study . DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING Records keep regulatory folder contain : SCC document Project Management plan Protocol appendices Letter ethical approval Information sheet blank form Signed consent form subject All filled paper form file . Individual medical record file together . All data Case Report Forms ( CRF ) must legibly record blue black ink type . A correction make strike incorrect entry single line enter correct information adjacent . The correction must initial dated investigator designate , qualified individual . Any requested information obtain specify protocol explanation note CRF require information obtain . Role Data Management The Data manager responsible receiving , enter , query , analyse , store data accrues study . He responsible link epidemiological clinical data field clinic laboratory data immunology , microbiology , haematology genetics laboratory . Adverse Events ( AE ) Reporting Adverse event , however minor , record observed Investigators volunteer subject . Full detail document CRF whether Investigator deputy consider event relate trial substance . Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) Reporting Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) occur study within six month final vaccination notify immediately ( within 24 hour ) telephone Safety Monitor , Ethics Committee , collaborator fund agency . Serious adverse event define event : - result death ; - life-threatening ( i.e. , subject risk death time event ) ; - require prolongs in-patient hospitalization ; - result persistent significant disability/incapacity ; - congenital anomaly/birth defect ; - cancer . Note : Proven malaria event include SAE . Minimum detail give telephone report : - Name reporting doctor contact telephone number . - Study number . - Nature adverse event . - Subject detail ( number , initial , sex , date birth , weight age ) . - Date time event . - Date time MVA85A administration dose . - Other drug history . - Other relevant history . - Outcome . - Causality . The event document SAE page CRF report Safety Monitor , Ethics Committee , Collaborators funding agency appropriate . Other adverse event grade . After ethic committee ’ response SAE receive , Principal Investigator , Clinical Monitor available co-investigators meet determine future plan study , could involve amend protocol , discontinue vaccination , continue unchanged volunteer . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS General Design Issues A total 12 subject sufficient provide descriptive data . As subject may drop study , 12 subject . However , 10 individual give vaccine . Outcomes interest Safety Vaccine This determine degree number adverse event report . Immunogenicity vaccine It expect vaccine stimulate T cell response , measure interferon –gamma Elispot assay . Sample Size Accrual Formal sample size calculation perform believed sample size 10 subject sufficient purpose . No attempt make study conceal allocation group subject either subject , investigator laboratory personnel . Monitoring Analysis The data manager responsible monitoring trial . This include confirm existence appropriate document regulatory folder source document enter data . He would also assess consistency data . The data manager responsible data entry initial analysis result . The main analysis descriptive comparative . HUMAN SUBJECTS Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Review Informed Consent The study approve joint MRC/ Gambia government ethical committee . Written inform consent obtain subject ( parent , legal guardian , person power attorney subject consent , , legal age ) . The subject 's assent must also obtain able understand nature , significance risk associate study . The informed consent describe purpose study , procedure follow , risk benefit participation . A signed copy consent form give subject ( parent legal guardian ) . Subject Confidentiality All record keep secure place . All data computer file restrict access . Clinical information release without write permission subject , except necessary monitoring .</detailed_description>
