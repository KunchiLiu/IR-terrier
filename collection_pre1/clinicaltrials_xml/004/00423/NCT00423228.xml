	<brief_title>Efficacy Study ZT-1 Implant Patients Suffering From Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomise , double-blind , double-dummy , oral donepezil control study safety efficacy repeat monthly s.c. injection sustained-release implant ZT 1 patient moderate Alzheimer 's Disease . The study enroll patient age &gt; 50 year , moderate AD MMSE score study screen ≥14 ≤22 . The study aim recruit 128 patient . The study divide 3 period : 1 . A screening period 2 . A 6-month treatment period , consist one month titration oral medication 5 month treatment implant administer skin every 4 week . Oral treatment maintain throughout treatment phase 3 . A 2 week follow-up period . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio one 2 group : ZT-1 ( investigational product ) treatment group donepezil ( active comparator ) treatment group . The study comprise total 11 visit include screen follow-up . An additional visit PK/PD assessment schedule 10 % patient .</detailed_description>
