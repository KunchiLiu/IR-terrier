	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Safety Immunogenicity Recombinant MVA Vaccine Encoding Secreted Antigen From M. Tuberculosis , Antigen 85A , Delivered Intradermally Needle Injection Healthy Volunteers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . This phase I study assesss safety immunogenicity recombinant MVA encode secrete antigen Mycobacterium . tuberculosis Antigen 85A , deliver intrdermally needle injection healthy BCG naive volunteer . 2 . Selection volunteer Volunteers study recruit advertisement . Each volunteer receive information sheet concern study agree participate writing . Volunteers give least 48 hour read information leaflet agree participate . Female volunteer tell theoretical risk congenital anomaly become pregnant study undertake take precaution avoid pregnancy study period eligible . Volunteers give sign consent GP ’ notify participation trial . The GP faxed letter day screen ask reply know reason volunteer take part . The signed consent form also faxed letter . 3 . Screening Volunteers ask sign inform consent form screening . The follow performed : - Medical history examination - Laboratory evaluation – include clinical chemistry , haematology , HLA typing , anti-vaccinia antibody , anti-HBV antibody , anti-HCV antibody , anti-HIV antibody - Heaf test – exclude prior exposure TB - Urinalysis urine pregnancy test female 4 . Inclusion Criteria - Healthy adult age 18-45 year . - Normal medical history physical examination . - Normal urine dipstick , blood count , liver enzymes , creatinine . 5 . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Exposure TB/BCG vaccination point . Previous residence TB endemic area . 2 . Clinically significant history skin disorder ( eczema , psoriasis , etc . ) , allergy , immunodeficiency , cardiovascular disease , respiratory disease , endocrine disorder , liver disease , renal disease , gastrointestinal disease , neurological illness , psychiatric disorder , drug alcohol abuse . 3 . Oral systemic steroid medication use immunosuppressive agent . 4 . Positive HIV antibody test , HCV antibody test positive HBV serology except post-vaccination . 5 . Positive Heaf test 6 . Confirmed pregnancy 7 . Previous MVA immunisation 6 . Withdrawal Criteria 1 . Withdrawal consent subject reason 2 . Loss follow-up 3 . Non-compliance study procedures 4 . Protocol violation 5 . Serious adverse event ( define Appendix 3 ) 6 . Any reason discretion Principal Investigator 7 . Confirmed pregnancy study period 7 Immunisation On Day 0 Day 21 , subject receive single intradermal injection 5 x 107pfu 0.1ml deltoid muscle . Subjects observed hour immunisation . Vital sign monitor 30 60 minute post-immunisation . Local reaction site administration evaluate 60 minute . A photograph injection site may take 48 hour ( write consent ) . The injection site review 7 day immunization . Blood take follow time point : At screen visit* , prior first vaccination , *1 week first vaccination , prior second vaccination , *1 week second vaccination , 4 week , 8 week , *12 week 24 week second vaccination . Up 55 ml take one time total 500 ml study period . *Samples take date test full blood count biochemical screen . Immunological assay perform time point determine vaccine immunogenicity . A pregnancy test perform screening vaccination day prior vaccination female volunteer . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell prepare cellular immunological assay perform without follow cryopreservation . Other serological measure immune response , i.e . antibody titre , assay frozen plasma sample . At end six month follow-up period , volunteer offer BCG immunisation . If accept , imunological monitering continue six month . 50mls blood take cellular immunological assay 1 week , 2 week , 1 month , 2 month , 3 month 6 month BCG immunisation . All blood test take within 1-3 day due date describe schedule . 8 Endpoints The occurance severity local side-effects . The occurance severity systemic side-effects . The induction T cell response ( measure interferon-gamma Elispot assay ) . Proliferation assay cytotoxic T cell assay perform strong CD4+ CD8+ responses respectively . This study complete .</detailed_description>
