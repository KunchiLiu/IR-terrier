	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective give together bevacizumab treat patient colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study bevacizumab compare well work give together two different combination chemotherapy regimens first-line therapy treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination Chemotherapy First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival 6 month patient unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer treat first-line therapy comprise bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ( FOLFIRI ) v bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride capecitabine ( XELIRI ) . Secondary - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare objective response rate duration response patient treat regimen . - Compare tumor control patient treat regimen . - Compare progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , WHO performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) , age ( &lt; 65 year vs ≥ 65 year ) , number metastatic site ( 1 v ≥ 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue receive bevacizumab alone every 2 week absence disease progression . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 oral capecitabine day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue receive bevacizumab alone every 3 week absence disease progression . Quality life assess periodically . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 144 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
