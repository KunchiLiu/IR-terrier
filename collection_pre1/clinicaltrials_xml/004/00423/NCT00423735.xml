	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine therapeutic efficacy dasatinib patient ( i.e. , stag 1B 2 combine ) recurrent/progressive glioblastoma ( GBM ) measure 6-month progression-free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine therapeutic efficacy dasatinib stage 1B patient recurrent/progressive GBM measure hybrid endpoint 6-month progression-free survival OR objective response ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) rate . II . To determine patient overall survival . III . To determine toxicity dasatinib treatment patient GBM . IV . To determine radiographic response rate treatment . V. To determine patient progression-free survival . VI . To explore molecular correlate clinical outcome . VII . To explore pharmacokinetic correlate dose , toxicity , efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
