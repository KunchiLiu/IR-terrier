	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil mitomycin C , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) mitomycin C may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give intensity-modulated radiation therapy together fluorouracil mitomycin C work treat patient invasive anal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine dose-painted , intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , fluorouracil , mitomycin C decrease combine rate gastrointestinal genitourinary adverse event ( grade II great ) least 15 % first 90 day start treatment patient primary invasive carcinoma anal canal compare patient treat radiotherapy , fluorouracil , mitomycin C arm clinical trial RTOG 98-11 . Secondary - Determine feasibility perform IMRT patient cooperative group set . - Evaluate adverse event experience patient treated regimen decrease grade 2 high grade 3 high overall adverse event rate 15 % 20 % compare radiotherapy mitomycin C arm RTOG 98-11 . - Evaluate total duration radiotherapy . - Evaluate efficacy regimen , term locoregional failure , disease-free survival , time colostomy , colostomy-free survival , overall survival patient . - Determine clinical complete response 8 week completion study treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive mitomycin C IV 10-30 minute day 1 29 fluorouracil IV continuously 96 hour day 1-4 29-32 . Patients also undergo dose-painted intensity-modulated radiation therapy daily , 5 day week , 5½ 6 week begin day 1 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 59 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
