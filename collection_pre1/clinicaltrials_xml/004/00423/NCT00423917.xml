	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Fulvestrant bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving fulvestrant together bevacizumab may effective treatment metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give fulvestrant together bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess efficacy fulvestrant bevacizumab , term 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) , patient metastatic breast cancer previously treat aromatase inhibitor . Secondary - Assess quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine adverse-event profile patient . - Determine PFS overall survival patient . - Determine confirm response rate , duration response , time treatment failure , time first cytotoxic agent patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , prior every course , completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 51 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
