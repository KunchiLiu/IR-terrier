	<brief_summary>Patients schizophrenia problem think , know cognitive dysfunction . This appear responsible difficulty social occupational functioning . One particular cognitive function may important schizophrenia call context processing . This refer ability properly use information environment guide think behavior appropriate present circumstance . Problems function may explain patient schizophrenia think act unusual way , often problem manage aspect live healthy adult take grant . This cognitive function depend region brain call prefrontal cortex , show impaired function schizophrenia well . Unfortunately , biochemical aspect dysfunction presently unknown , clear whether current psychiatric medication improve function . A recent FDA-approved medication may improve function modafinil . Studies animals healthy adult show medication improve cognitive function relate context processing . We plan study effect modafinil context processing brain activity underlies function . We use functional MRI electrophysiology examine effect modafinil , single dose sustain ( 4 week ) treatment . We predict patient receive modafinil perform well cognitive test improve activity region brain responsible cognitive process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modafinil Treatment Cognitive Dysfunction Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia disorder cognition . The cognitive deficit schizophrenia present onset disorder , prior medication exposure , persistent period remission , strongly related functional outcome . These deficit prominently include prefrontal-dependent function . While exist medication effectively treat psychotic symptom , exhibit modest benefit best cognitive dysfunction . Studies cognition animal model indicate neurotransmitter system mediate prefrontal-dependent cognitive process generally augment exist antipsychotic medication . Therefore , advance treatment schizophrenia require study agent novel pharmacological profile establish potential remediate cognitive dysfunction . Advances understand mechanism action agent also require integration pharmacology sophisticated methodology test cognition . This goal strongly pursue recent year use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study pharmacological effect cognition . fMRI study identify cortical network subserve cognitive control work memory , consistently impair among schizophrenia patient . The study medication effect process fMRI ( pharmaco-fMRI ) permit precise delineation cognitive mechanism amenable pharmacological intervention . This study use fMRI study effect modafinil functional neuroanatomy underlie prefrontal cognitive process . Modafinil FDA-approved medication unique pharmacological profile increase range off-label indication . Its neurochemical effect animal model include elevation extracellular dopamine ( DA ) , noradrenaline ( NA ) glutamate neocortex . This profile favorable enhancement prefrontal cognitive process . These neurochemical effect also appear selective cortical versus subcortical brain region , suggest modafinil may minimal effect psychotic symptom , extrapyramidal , autonomic hormonal side effect . In addition , differs amphetamine structure , neurochemical profile behavioral effect , low risk addictive cerebrovascular effect . Recent study animal model , healthy adult adult psychiatric neurological disorder indicate modafinil improves prefrontal cognitive function . This suggest modafinil lead candidate treatment cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . We aim test modafinil effect process healthy adult , order evaluate modafinil effect normal-range cognition , evaluate remediation deficit function individual schizophrenia , single-dose trial follow trial sustain treatment . Comparison 1 . The effect healthy adult adult schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder , Modafinil 200 milligram single oral dose versus placebo ( double-blind , balance crossover design ) , cognitive control task performance , activity dorsolateral prefrontal cortical ( DLPFC ) context processing , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) conflict monitoring phase task , measure fMRI . Comparison 2 . The effect adult schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder , 4-week randomize , double-blind treatment Modafinil 200 milligram daily versus placebo , cognitive control task performance , activity dorsolateral prefrontal cortical ( DLPFC ) context processing , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) conflict monitoring phase task , measure fMRI .</detailed_description>
