	<brief_title>Infusion Donor Lymphocytes Transduced With Suicide Gene HSV TK Patients With Haematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed immune-reconstitution remain one main limitation haploidentical stem cell transplantation . The risk severe infection remain high several month CD4+ reconstitution could take 10 month . The low number lymphocyte infuse graft , degree HLA disparity , reduce thymic function adult difference host/donor antigen present cell contribute cause . The infusion HSV-TK engineer lymphocyte may represent significant therapeutic improvement haploidentical haplo-HCT , remarkably may enhance GvL activity , thus reduce occurrence disease relapse , post-transplant immune reconstitution absence chronic immune suppression , thus decrease rate post-transplant opportunistic infection transplant-related mortality . Furthermore , efficient control GvHD achieve via suicide mechanism allow also multiple infusion HSV-TK-treated donor lymphocyte , need , might improve post-transplant host immune reconstitution , , eventually , survival patient receive haplo-HCT . Finally , therapeutic approach , allow safe infusion escalate dos donor lymphocyte , become valuable option candidate , include patient advanced disease old age . The proposed clinical trial represent innovative therapeutic treatment patient affect hematological malignancy , undergone haploidentical stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
