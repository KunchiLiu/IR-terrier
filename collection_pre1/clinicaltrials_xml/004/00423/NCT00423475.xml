	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , goserelin , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Giving radiation therapy without goserelin surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without goserelin treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy goserelin see well work compare radiation therapy alone treat patient undergone surgery recurrent refractory prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Goserelin Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Recurrent Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy adjuvant radiotherapy v without concurrent goserelin , term biological and/or clinical progression-free survival , patient undergo surgery recurrent refractory prostate cancer . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare metastases-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare immediate delayed toxicity regimen . - Compare delay reach prostate-specific antigen nadir patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life 1 5 year radiotherapy patient . - Compare functional dependence 1 5 year radiotherapy patient age 75 year . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , parallel-group , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 7 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy arm I . Patients also receive goserelin subcutaneously day 1 3 month later . Quality life assess periodically . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 466 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
