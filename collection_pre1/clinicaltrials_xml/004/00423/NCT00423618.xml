	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether give radiation therapy small area tissue surround tumor effective give radiation therapy wider area tissue surround tumor treat soft tissue sarcoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give external-beam radiation therapy small area tissue surround tumor see well work compare give external-beam radiation therapy wider area tissue surround tumor treat patient undergone surgery soft tissue sarcoma arm , hand , leg , foot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine reduce volume adjuvant radiotherapy increase limb function without compromise local control patient previously resect extremity soft tissue sarcoma . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine overall level disability patient treat regimen . - Determine disease-free survival overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , prospective , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor grade ( 1 vs 2 v 3 ) , adequacy surgical clearance ( R0 v R1 ) , treatment center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( control ) : Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) , include full margin , daily 5 day week 6Â½ week . - Arm II : Patients undergo EBRT arm I reduce margin include . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 400 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
