	<brief_summary>This study collect heart tissue routinely remove discarded open-heart surgery . The Cardiology Branch NHLBI conduct variety laboratory experiment require sample heart tissue . A segment tissue routinely cut right atrial appendage heart open-heart surgery allow heart-lung bypass machine attach heart protection surgery . This small tissue sample re-attached bypass machine remove , usually destroy medical waste . ' People 18 80 year age schedule undergo coronary artery bypass surgery aortic valve replacement surgery may eligible study . Participants donate right atrial appendage heart , would normally destroy open-heart surgery . The tissue use NHLBI investigator study direct learn make heart less sensitive damage heart attack . The sample may use , example , evaluate effectiveness know therapy , refine treatment approach , identify potential new therapy , explore opportunity disease prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transient non-lethal ischemia follow reperfusion activates cell survival program resulting increase tolerance subsequent ischemic injury . This biological phenomenon term ischemic preconditioning powerful cell survival program operational human heart . This program trigger signal intermediate activate response transient ischemia/hypoxia reperfusion precondition . Characterization signal intermediate enable u identify therapeutic agent augment tissue tolerance ischemia . Interestingly , nitrite , endogenous reservoir nitric oxide ( NO ) , undergoes bioconversion NO via hypoxia-dependent signaling . Whether nitrite accumulation bioconversion component ischemic precondition program unknown . Recently Dr. Gladwin colleague Vascular Medicine Branch unequivocally demonstrate exogenous nitrite administration cytoprotective ischemia-reperfusion injury murine liver heart canine heart . Establishing mechanistic link ischemic preconditioning program nitrite biology would promote nitrite attractive compound future therapeutic intervention . To evaluate link , propose use cardiac right atrial appendage tissue routinely excise facilitate right atrial cannulation heart-lung bypass . This excised tissue usually discard medical waste . We hypothesize nitrite administration atrial tissue ex-vivo study demonstrate increase tolerance ischemic stress compare atrial tissue expose nitrite . Furthermore , propose cytoprotective effect nitrite administration demonstrate equivalency cytoprotection response ischemic preconditioning . Finally , would employ tissue identify nitrite mediate genomic , proteomic metabolomic modification human myocardium , thereby identify biological program orchestrate cytoprotective property nitrite human heart .</detailed_description>
