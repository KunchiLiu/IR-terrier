	<brief_summary>Tooth-root resorption , also know shorten erosion , ( TRR ) one adverse outcomes dental trauma , orthodontic tooth movement dental replantation/transplantation . Orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption ( OIIRR ) somewhat different type TRR . The treatment protocol teeth diagnose severe OIIRR form TRR always involve root canal treatment extraction teeth severe case prosthetic replacement . Sometimes teeth minor TRR may stay extended period time compromise bite function . Although several trial propose minimize prevent TRR OIIRR , none capable used clinical situation treat TRR OIIRR human except Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound ( LIPUS ) . However , research examine use LIPUS treat OIIRR limit simple orthodontic tooth tip . In reality , tooth movement combination different type tooth movement , namely tip , bodily , rotational , torque , intrusion extrusion tooth movement . However , literature point torque tooth movement , especially root apex torque cortical plate bone produce dramatic type tooth root resorption poor prognosis . Our long-term goal develop standard protocol treat severe tooth root resorption poor prognosis human , regardless origin . Our preliminary data demonstrates LIPUS produce heal OIIRR human simple tip movement , confirm in-vitro study isolate cementoblasts . The objective present proposal evaluate effect different treatment protocol LIPUS heal process orthodontically induce tooth-root resorption due torque ( Complex ) type tooth movement human . The study Hypotheses ( I ) LIPUS treatment 20 minute per day 4 week effective repair OIIRR due torque tooth movement . ( II ) The stimulatory effect LIPUS repair OIIRR due torque tooth movement LIPUS treatment dose time dependent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient , specially design spring use achieve standard torque orthodontic tooth movement first premolars induce OIIRR . The first molar stabilize , use special appliance help movement premolar . This type appliance design use many year similar clinical trial many researcher receive wide acceptability without report problem teeth experimental period . Ultrasound apply twenty minute per day , start day spring activate , four week , use ultrasound device ( Exogen Inc. , West Caldwell , NJ , USA ) . Only first premolar receiving ultrasound . The patient instruct ultrasound transducer . The non LIPUS treat premolar receive sham transducer . A visual analogue scale provide patient record pain discomfort patient might experience application ultrasound . It expect evidence deleterious effect intervene soft tissue inform discomfort experience patient preliminary study . After four eight week LIPUS treatment , spring remove , first premolar extract , use non-traumatic technique . The extracted teeth fix , study Î¼-CT process analyze histomorphometrically</detailed_description>
