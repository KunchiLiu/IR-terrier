	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn whether hydrate ( give liquid ) catheter vein tissue skin improve symptom dehydration . Objectives : 1.1 Determine whether parenteral hydration superior placebo improve symptom associate dehydration ( fatigue , myoclonus , sedation , hallucination ) advance cancer patient receive hospice care . 1.2 Determine whether parenteral hydration superior placebo delay onset reduce severity delirium patient advance cancer receive hospice care . 1.3 Describe meaning patient primary caregiver attribute dehydration re-hydration end patient 's life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parenteral Hydration Advanced Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Caregivers : Symptoms dehydration may include fatigue , muscle contraction , need sedation ( calm medication ) , hallucination ( something sense actually ) . Hydration allow body get rid waste product medication chemical . When fluid level body increase , brain function may directly improve . If patient care find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 group . Participants Group 1 receive normal saline ( salt water ) day . Participants Group 2 receive low amount normal saline day . This low amount small enough consider placebo . Doctors call something placebo look like substance test active ingredient ( case , active ingredient ) . Both patient ask complete number questionnaire begin study , Days 1-7 , every 3-5 day . Your questionnaire ask feeling may hydration care provide patient . Each day 's questionnaire take 30 minute . Both patient also interview researcher begin study Day 4 ( +/- 2 day ) . The interview include question like patient get fluid , whether fluid like food medicine , whether patient ever gotten dehydrate , manage patient 's care . The interview take 30 minute . The interview study audio tap information study researcher . Only research staff listen audio tape interview . If patient go study , participation study . This investigational study . Up 150 patient 150 caregiver take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . For Patients : Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask complete questionnaire . It ask question cancer diagnosis , medication take , symptom . The questionnaire also ask memory dehydrate , like get fluid , manage care , whether fluid like food medicine . It take 30 minute complete . Both caregiver also interview researcher . There question like get fluid , whether fluid like food medicine , whether ever get dehydrate . Each interview take 30 minute . The interview study audio tap information study researcher . The study staff also check symptom muscle contraction , one sign dehydration . The study staff videotape face , arm , hand , leg toe total 3-5 minute Days 1 , 4 , 7 , every 3-5 day . As part screening test , also blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . You ask question ability perform daily activity ( performance status evaluation ) . You ask side effect may , include muscle contraction . You also ask list pain medication medication take . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants Group 1 receive normal saline ( salt water ) day . Participants Group 2 receive low amount normal saline day . This low amount small enough consider placebo . Doctors call something placebo look like substance test active ingredient ( case , active ingredient ) . You equal chance place either group . Neither medical staff researcher study know dose receiving . The research nurse ask complete several questionnaire ask question dehydration symptom may experience , include fatigue . The questionnaire complete Days 1-7 , every 3-5 day . In total , day 's questionnaire take 30 minute . Your caregiver also ask memory dehydration . On Day 7 , blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . Both caregiver also interview researcher Day 4 ( +/- 2 day ) , every 3-5 day . The interview like one screen . Starting Day 1 study , receive saline catheter vein ( 4 hour ) every day . If already central venous catheter , receive saline catheter . If central venous catheter , saline infuse skin . Either way , infusion last 4 hour . During infusion , infusion research nurse check make sure saline give properly . This nurse know treatment group assign . Every day , research nurse ask dehydration side effect may . Every day , research nurse also check place infusion give make sure infection . On Days 1-7 every 3-5 day , research nurse also check dehydration symptom include need sedation , restless feeling action , and/or muscle contraction . You performance status evaluation daily . On Days 1-7 , research nurse ask pain medication medication take . Every day , 2 hour [ +/- 3 hour ] infusion end , also check assessment research nurse know treatment group . The assessment research nurse ask symptom may . The study staff also check symptom muscle contraction , one sign dehydration . The study staff videotape face , arm , hand , leg toe total 3-5 minute Days 1 , 4 , 7 , every 3-5 day . You may remain study receive daily infusion long benefitting Day 14 [ +/- 3 day ] . On Day 14 [ +/- 3 day ] take study , study assessment , include question symptom include fatigue , performance status , medication take , dehydration symptom . If intolerable side effect occur , take study give appropriate medical care . If wish continue receive hydration fluid take study [ Day 14 +/- 3 day ] , may discuss option attend hospice physician . You may receive liter normal saline day skin . Treatment give hospice nurse . Fluid provide free charge . This investigational study . Up 150 patient 150 caregiver take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
