	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia ( FMS ) condition mark pain , fatigue , memory complaint , consider chronic condition commonly treat manage use medication . Previous study find benefit add cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , non-medication intervention , standard care order obtain good outcome term improve functional status symptom reduction . While addition CBT standard care show beneficial , form therapy widely available patient FMS . CBT include variety skill teach patient help management chronic illness . This protocol examine relative merit provide CBT skill patient via informational website . The website contain content CBT , social support capability , data transfer capability . The addition website standard care compare standard care alone . This study interested assess improvement physical functional status , symptom FMS , relative cost intervention compare saving health care utilization 6-month period . Primary Hypothesis The primary hypothesis study number patient fibromyalgia able achieve clinically meaningful improvement physical function great standard symptom-based pharmacological care augment CBT skill deliver educational website . Secondary Hypotheses 1 . The proportion patient fibromyalgia able achieve clinically meaningful improvement symptom FMS pain , fatigue , perceive cognitive difficulty great standard symptom-based pharmacological care augment CBT skill deliver educational website 2 . The proportion patient fibromyalgia able achieve clinically meaningful improvement mood belief pain great standard symptom-based pharmacological care augment CBT skill deliver educational website</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy therapeutic approach use specific technique produce behavioral cognitive change . CBT singular approach problem ; rather set technique tailor specific problem . The technique fall rubric CBT common scientific foundation base learn cognitive principle . The technique use change behavior base principle classical operant conditioning ( e.g . extinction , positive negative reinforcement , shape , prompt ) , observational learning . The technique use produce cognitive change base largely development problem solve skill principle attributional change ( Craighead , Craighead , Kazdin , &amp; Mahoney , 1994 ) . Cognitive behavioral therapy show effective management symptom wide range chronic medical illness ( Compas , Haaga , Keefe , Leitenberg , &amp; Williams , 1998 ; Emmelkamp &amp; van Oppen , 1993 ; Gil et al. , 1996 ) ( 1994 ; Emmelkamp et al. , 1993 ; Turner &amp; Romano , 1990 ; Gil et al. , 1996 ; Keefe , 1996 ) include Fibromyalgia ( Bradley , 1989 ; Nielson , Walker , &amp; McCain , 1992 ; White &amp; Nielson , 1995 ; Goldenberg , Kaplan , &amp; Nadeau , 1994 ; Nielson et al. , 1992 ; White et al. , 1995 ; Goldenberg et al. , 1994 ) relate condition chronic fatigue syndrome ( Sharpe et al. , 1996 ; Deale , Chalder , Marks , &amp; Wessely , 1997 ; Deale , Chalder , Marks , &amp; Wessely , 1997 ) . The rationale use CBT FMS stem assumption pain suffer result complex integration pathophysiology , cognition , affect , behavior ( Keefe , 1996 ) . Modification one four factor positively negatively impact course persistent medical condition . When applied patient fibromyalgia , CBT show associate short-term ( 3 week ) long-term ( 30 month ) improvement pain , distress , perceive control pain ( Nielson et al. , 1992 ; White et al. , 1995 ; White et al. , 1995 ) . Several investigation CBT demonstrate improvement depression , pain behavior , tenderness ( Nicassio et al. , 1997 ) , well knowledge fibromyalgia cop pain ( Vlaeyen et al. , 1996 ) . While latter two study demonstrate superiority CBT educational approach , meta-analytic review conclude psychological intervention fibromyalgia general produce effect size exceeded physical therapy pharmacological intervention outcomes symptom , mental health , physical functioning ( Rossy et al. , 1999 ) . The latter outcome , sustain improvement physical functioning , difficult outcome achieve patient fibromyalgia use form intervention . One recent study however demonstrate 1-year sustained improvement physical functional status three time likely patient attend brief course CBT receive symptom-based pharmacological care ( Williams , 2002 ) . New Advances CBT Delivery Despite demonstrated effectiveness combine pharmacological intervention CBT , integration CBT mainstream clinical practice FMS slow . Barriers due lack demonstrated efficacy , rather economic administrative issue lack CPT code apply psychological intervention physical illness , difficulty administer time-intensive psychological intervention population must travel long distance week obtain intervention , lack sufficient number train professional deliver intervention large scale ( Muehrer , 2000 ) . A current technology , Internet websites , implemented effort overcome barrier prevent delivery clinical service FMS population . Healthcare Websites E-learning , use website education without use live instructor , become popular method educate lay-public , offer class credit continue education online , train employee new job skill . Numerous website exist purport improve health . Some site simply provide information illness , others provide interactive preprogrammed advice , send tailor health message patient . The current study seek evaluate effectiveness use traditional standard care standard care plus Internet web-based educational programming . This one large randomize controlled trial use web-based learning help identify feasibility use modality augment standard care FMS community .</detailed_description>
