	<brief_summary>Given poor prognosis HIV-associated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) 's still high incidence HAART era , intensive therapy require patient initially severe stage NHL relapse first-line chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate safety intensive chemotherapy follow peripheral blood cell transplantation patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Intensification HIV-associated Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Peripheral Blood Cell Transplantation Following Chemotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) dramatically reduce mortality morbidity HIV-infected patient decrease incidence opportunistic infection HIV-related malignancy Kaposi sarcoma . However , frequency NHL remain increased patient . Moreover , prognostic remains poor compare HIV negative patient . This mainly due type NHL ( aggressive B , frequent stage IV ) also host factor immunodeficiency , co-infections ( EBV , HHV8 ) , chemotherapy-HAART interaction . In lack new significantly efficient treatment , therapeutic intensification high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) , already test relapse partially respond HIV negative patient , could option HAART control HIV+ patient NHL , rather first complete remission ( CR ) initially high International Prognosis Index ( IPI equal 2 ) , second CR , whatever initial IPI . Positive selection CD34+ cell approach deplete graft tumour cell HIV DNA . However delay lymphocyte recovery follow process , may lead increase incidence opportunistic infection ( OI ) HIV-infected patient . OI prophylaxis systematically associate . Eligible patient peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) mobilization divide two subgroup . Group A 3-6 x 106 PBSC undergo CD34+ selection process group B 6 x 106 undergo process . The myeloablative conditioning process two group total body irradiation reinfusion graft . Patients follow week2 ( W2 ) W60 clinical biological evaluation .</detailed_description>
