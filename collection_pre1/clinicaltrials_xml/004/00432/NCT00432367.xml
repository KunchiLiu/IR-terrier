	<brief_summary>Among best practice recommend malaria control pregnancy ensure effective case management malaria illness . However , often practice ( 1 ) malaria infection pregnancy often asymptomatic , ( 2 ) peripheral parasitaemia may absent even placenta heavily parasitized , ( 3 ) implement diagnosis treatment malaria within routine antenatal service may difficult ( 4 ) antimalarial treatment option available pregnant woman limit due resistance chloroquine ( CQ ) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP0 paucity safety efficacy data antimalarial drug pregnancy , particularly artemisinin combination treatment ( ACT ) . Therefore commonest recommend practice pregnancy administration SP intermittent preventive treatment ( SP-IPTp ) . However , effectiveness SP-IPTp question parasite resistance SP spread rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa . This three-arm open label randomise control non-inferiority trial insecticide-treated net ( ITN ) plus rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) screening , treatment SP amodiaquine plus artimisinin ( AQ+AS ) versus ITN plus IPTp use SP . It carry pregnant woman parity present enrol antenatal clinic gestation 16 20 week first book . The key objective demonstrate ( 1 ) prevalence severe anaemia ( Hb &lt; 8g/dl ) 34 36 week gestation ( 2 ) prevalence low birth weight ( BW &lt; 2500g ) delivery within 72 hour delivery ( 3 ) prevalence placenta parasitaemia ( 4 ) incidence serious non-serious adverse event ITN plus RDT screen treatment arm great ITN plus IPTp arm . Alongside clinical assessment , health care cost assessment do determine cost-effectiveness two delivery strategy measure case severe maternal anaemia avert .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General objective To show long-lasting insecticide-treated net ( LLIN ) ///// plus RDT screen treatment strategy inferior LLIN plus SP-IPTp reduce burden malaria pregnancy . Specific objective Primary 1 . To demonstrate prevalence severe anaemia ( Hb &lt; 8g/dl ) 34 36 week gestation LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm great LLIN plus IPTp arm . Secondary 1 . To demonstrate prevalence low birth weight ( BW &lt; 2500g ) delivery within 72 hour delivery LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm great LLIN plus IPTp arm . 2 . To demonstrate prevalence anaemia ( Hb &lt; 11g/dl ) 34 36 week gestation LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm great LLIN plus IPTp arm . 3 . To demonstrate prevalence placental parasitaemia LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm great LLIN plus IPTp arm . 4 . To demonstrate incidence spontaneous abortion , intrauterine deaths/stillbirths , neonatal maternal mortality developmental delay LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm great LLIN plus IPTp arm . 5 . To demonstrate cost per case ( 1 ) severe maternal anaemia avert ( 2 ) maternal anaemia avert ( 3 ) peripheral malaria avert ( 4 ) placenta malaria avert high LLIN plus RDT screen case management arm LLIN plus SP-IPTp arm . Sample size The prevalence severe anaemia delivery low birth weight show 12 % 5.7 % respectively among Gambian multigravidae receive varying dos SP-IPT ( Mbaye et al . 2006 ) . In absence local data propose study site , estimate prevalence severe anaemia third trimester low birth weight 12 % 6 % respectively LLIN +SP-IPTp arm study , similar Gambian population . For trial planning set non-inferiority margin 5 % . This mean would consider LLIN + RDT screen SP AQ+AS treatment option inferior LLIN +SP-IPTp option prevalence severe anaemia 34 36 week 5 % great LLIN+RDT SP AS+AQ treatment arm observe LLIN+SP-IPT arm . Since expect prevalence severe anaemia LLIN +SP-IPTp arm would 12 % , need 887 woman per arm detect 5 % difference two study arm 95 % significance 90 % power . Considering 20 % dropout rate need 1110 woman per arm . Setting non-inferiority margin 5 % seem clinically statistically relevant ; yield sample size make execution study feasible within time frame resource available . Choosing small margin 5 % may tight require large sample size 2000 per arm might feasible achievable within time frame ; large margin 5 % may liberal compare public health impact intervention . We estimate 925 woman per arm show 90 % power 95 % significance level account 20 % dropout rate , prevalence low birth weight associate LLIN + RDT screen without SP AQ+AS treatment bad LLIN + SP-IPTp margin 4 % . Since , sample size 1110 per arm adequate detect effect intervention birth weight maternal Hb , total 3330 pregnant woman recruit study . Study Design A three-arm open label randomise control non-inferiority trial RDT screen without treatment SP AQ+AS versus IPTp use SP follow : - 1 . OptiMAL® antigen screen treatment SP plus LLIN 2 . OptiMAL® antigen screen treatment AQ+AS plus LLIN 3 . SP-IPTp plus LLIN Study site population The study conduct Ejisu-Juaben Sekyere East district Ashanti Region Ghana . Enrolment do simultaneously antenatal clinic Effiduase Juaben district hospital sub district health centre district . The Effiduase Juaben hospital 50 40 bed respectively provide basic medical service include adult medicine , paediatrics , surgery obstetrics gynaecology . They run weekly antenatal clinic session together register average 220 new pregnant woman per month . The sub district health centre ( Kwaso Kumawu ) man qualified medical assistant midwife . Together register average 80 new pregnant woman per month . All health facility study district include propose enrol clinic offer SP-IPT pregnant woman follow MoH guideline . Pregnant woman second third trimester diagnose malaria treat AQ+AS recommend MoH facility . The study population comprise pregnant woman present hospital 's antenatal clinic gestation 16 24 week first book . Enrolment Procedures A schematic profile study show Figure 1 . All study woman recruit weekly antenatal clinic session hold study site period one half year . Three team midwives assistant put together trained principal investigator ( PI ) assist PI research team conduct recruitment antenatal clinic hour . The standard operating procedure clinic follow : 1 . Randomise pregnant woman report ANC consent participate study three arm : IPTp arm , RDT screen SP case management arm RDT screen AQ+AS case management arm . Distribute LLIN eligible pregnant woman arm . 2 . Obtain blood baseline investigation include haemoglobin level , thin thick blood film malaria parasite count , filter paper blood spot . 3 . Assess pregnant woman RDT treatment group clinically obstetrically prior OptiMAL® dipstick screening ; parasitaemic offer SP AQ+AS ingestion first dose observe directly ANC . Encourage woman regularly sleep bed net provide take daily dos iron folic acid tablet . 4 . For woman RDT treatment group negative offer daily dos iron folic acid tablet encourage regularly sleep bed net provide . 5 . Women IPTp group receive SP ingestion directly observe ANC accord national guideline . Encourage woman regularly sleep bed net provide take daily dos iron folic acid tablet . 6 . Women decline participation study receive SP-IPTp accord national guideline . Antenatal Follow-Up Procedures 1 . Day 7 : Women receive SP AQ+AS treatment follow actively day 7 post treatment assess adverse event week post treatment . 2 . At 6 month : repeat SP-IPT woman IPT arm treat woman case management arm SP AQ+AS RDT positive . Women case management arm negative RDT would receive haematinic . Ask study woman regularly sleep bed net provide . 3 . At 8 month : repeat SP-IPT woman IPT arm treat woman case management arm SP AQ+AS RDT positive . Women case management arm negative RDT would receive haematinic . Ask study woman regularly sleep bed net provide . 4 . At 34 36 week : actively follow woman sample blood finger prick haemoglobin measurement , slide smear malaria parasite count filter paper blood spot . 5 . Unscheduled visit : Women present history fever unscheduled visit test malaria parasite . If find parasitaemic , deem treatment failure give quinine rescue medication . 6 . All pregnant woman receive haematinic pack follow ups . Delivery Postpartum Follow-up 1 . The midwife record birth weight note stillbirths perinatal death . 2 . Midwives record congenital deformity verification confirmation clinician . 3 . Visits make toall woman baby 6 8 week post-delivery obtain report neonatal death adverse event . 4 . At 6 week post-partum , woman peripheral parasitaemia treat SP follow parasite clearance day 14 28 post-treatment . If parasite clearance day 14 and/or day 28 course rescue medication ( quinine ) give . This part study necessary ass efficacy SP clear parasitaemia .</detailed_description>
