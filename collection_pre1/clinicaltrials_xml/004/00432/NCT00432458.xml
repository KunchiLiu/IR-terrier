	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate may prevent bone loss stop growth cancer cell bone . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . It yet know whether give zoledronate together thalidomide effective zoledronate alone treat multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study zoledronate thalidomide see well work compare zoledronate alone treat patient early stage multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Early Stage Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare time progression patient early stage multiple myeloma treat zoledronate without thalidomide . Secondary - Compare response rate , 1-year progression-free survival rate , duration response , time next therapy patient treat regimen . - Assess difference toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord presence lytic lesion metastatic bone survey ( yes v ) , beta-2 microglobulin level ( high v normal ) , bone marrow label index ( high [ &gt; 1.0 % ] v low [ ≤ 1.0 % ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral thalidomide day 1-28 . Treatment thalidomide repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive zoledronate IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment zoledronate repeat every 84 day 1 year year thereafter absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive zoledronate IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 84 day 1 year year thereafter absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect research study baseline course 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . Bone marrow aspirate perform baseline course 6 12 . Samples evaluate bone marrow angiogenesis ; vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor 1 ( VEGFR-1 ) , VEGFR-2 expression ; bone marrow angiogenesis-VEGF relationship ; bone marrow angiogenesis/apoptosis rate relationship ; bone marrow angiogenesis/plasma cell ( PC ) proliferation rate relationship ; VEGF expression/apoptosis rate relationship ; VEGFR expression/PC proliferation rate relationship . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
