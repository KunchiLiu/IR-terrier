	<brief_title>Open Label Clinical Trial With Rituximab ( MabThera ® ) Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication : Moderate severe ankylose spondylitis inadequate response tolerate conventional therapy include NSAIDs , DMARDs TNF alpha inhibitor . Rationale : We argue already 10 year ago autoimmunity play important role pathogenesis ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . Although direct evidence , nearly ‘ suspected ’ autoimmune disease , autoimmune response AS propose repeatedly last year cartilage likely target autoimmune response AS . Histological study 4,5 magnet resonance image investigation suggest primary site inflammation cartilage/bone interphase . Mononuclear cell infiltrate mainly find cartilage subchondral bone . In early active sacroiliitis , T cell macrophages dominant infiltrates underline relevance specific cellular immune response 5.Furthermore , T cell response demonstrate proteoglycan ( important cartilage protein ) human arthritides include ankylose spondylitis . We could also recently demonstrate CD4+ CD8+ T cell response proteogkycan ( aggrecan ) derive peptides peripheral blood CD8+ T cell response collagen VI derive peptide synovial fluid AS patient . Thus , finding suggest chronic , probably T cell mediate , immune response cartilage relevant pathogenesis AS.This back recent study group demonstrate mononuclear infiltrates cartilage investigate femoral head facette joint ( small joint spine ) obtain surgery number AS patient ) . The presence mononuclear cell infiltrate strongly dependent presence cartilage surface femoral head , suggest cartilage could indeed stimulus target cellular immune response . However , rather surprisingly also dense infiltration B cell subchondral bone marrow patient . In comparison immunohistological staining control without spinal disease , number B cell AS even high T cell . At moment clear whether indicates autoantibody play role pathogenesis whether B cell might rather act important local antigen present cell . In case , give assume autoimmune pathogenesis AS presence B cell aggregate inflammatory cellular infiltrates study potential effect immunotherapy target B cell AS justify need . Objectives : To evaluate efficacy safety rituximab add NSAIDs and/ methotrexate TNFalpha inhibitor naïve TNFalpha inhibitor failure patient moderate severe ankylose spondylitis . Study design : Open label clinical trial study duration 48 week</detailed_description>
