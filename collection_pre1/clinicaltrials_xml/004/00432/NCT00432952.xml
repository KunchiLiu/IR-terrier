	<brief_summary>The acute effect farm rainbow trout , feed various feed versus control meal poultry meat cardiovascular risk marker plasma protein expression investigate . The hypothesis study feed change marine origin primarily vegetable origin content long chain n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) decrease meat thus possibly result decreased effect health . Furthermore , feed trout also expect give rise difference human plasma protein profile fatty acid composition consumption , could associate physiological effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In control , single blind human single meal study acute effect farm rainbow trout , feed various feed versus control meal poultry meat cardiovascular risk marker plasma protein expression investigate . 6 healthy men , age 40-70 , randomize trout fed vegetable , marine mix different composition vegetable marine feed . Outcome variables blood pressure , pulse wave analyse , pulse wave velocity , plasma protein profile , plasma triglyceride . The hypothesis study feed change marine origin primarily vegetable origin content long chain n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) decrease meat thus possibly result decreased effect health . Furthermore , feed trout also expect give rise difference human plasma protein profile fatty acid composition consumption , could associate physiological effect .</detailed_description>
