	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Coenzyme Q10 Mitochondrial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many patient mitochondrial disease lead progressive nerve muscle damage may associate problem think , talk , remember , walk balance . Sometimes may also cause abnormal build blood spinal fluid substance call lactic acid . This problem make blood spinal fluid acid , life-threatening . There know specific effective treatment mitochondrial disease . Sometimes certain diet improve condition seldom prevent nerve muscle damage reduce chance develop life-threatening acidity blood . CoQ10 approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment mitochondrial disease . It investigational drug believe may help people certain mitochondrial disease , like one , term reduce acidity blood prevent decrease nerve muscle damage . Our belief base previous study conduct child mitochondrial disease various type . Therefore , 12 month study design determine safety benefit take CoQ10 every day . This do comparing subject response take CoQ10 6 month take placebo 6 month . A placebo look , smell , taste like drug test ( case , CoQ10 ) effect . Placebo study one common evaluate investigational drug disease usually require FDA drug approve . CoQ10 placebo give liquid per day evening , mouth feed tube . The CoQ10 dose 10 mg/kg maximum dose 400 mg day . Neither subject health care giver know exactly subject receive CoQ10 subject receive placebo . However , subject receive CoQ10 least 6 month . At visit subject give seven month supply CoQ10 , nutritional cocktail , multivitamin take home ask bring back unused medication next visit . At visit subject give medication diary record time date take medication provide . This diary return study coordinator subject 's scheduled visit . During 12 month period subject study , expect stop take medication supplement except provide study study doctor determines medically need . Except case emergency , subject must contact study doctor take new medication supplement . In case emergency , subject require inform study doctor emergency treatment soon possible . Subjects hospitalize General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) ward Shands Hospital 2-4 day every three six month . A parent legal guardian expect stay subject . During hospitalization , physical intellectual development measure standard test . The GCRC dietician ask question current diet visit record answer . A general medical history physical examination ( include gross motor function and/or strength test ) perform visit well six minute walk test . While enrolled study , special `` nutritional cocktail '' Centrum-like multivitamin supplement provide subject take daily . The nutritional cocktail vitamin C , 10 mg/kg/day ( max . 400 mg/day ) , riboflavin , 2.5 mg/kg/day ( max . 100 mg/day ) , thiamine , 2.5 mg/kg/day ( 100 mg/day ) , carnitine , 10 mg/kg/day ( max . 400 mg/day ) . The nutritive cocktail capsule form number capsule subject take base body weight ( every 4 kg . body weight subject receive 1 capsule daily ) . Each capsule contain : Vitamin C 40 mg , Riboflavin 10 mg , thiamine 10 mg carnitine 40 mg . The maximum amount capsule give daily anyone study 10 capsule daily . A parent legal guardian ask complete eight questionnaire regard behavioral developmental , quality life ( 5 ) , sleep . The behavioral developmental , four quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires , sleep questionnaire complete 0 , 6 12 month visit . One QOL questionnaire ( 46 question ) need complete monthly mail back study center completion ( self-addressed , stamp envelope provide study give coordinator ) . We expect take 20 minute complete monthly QOL questionnaire 3 hour 0 , 6 12 month visit complete rest questionnaire . About 15-20 ml . blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) obtain hospitalization . A urine sample also collect hospital visit . In females child-bearing age , urine also collect tested presence HCG ( hormone determine pregnancy ) . Within 24 hour blood urine collection test result assess study physician .</detailed_description>
