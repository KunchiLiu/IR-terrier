	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : implement evaluate research protocol demonstrate efficacy Acupuncture Therapy improve neurological recovery incomplete SCI compare control protocol . Hypothesis : acupuncture treatment result great neurological recovery control treatment incomplete SCI . Before conduct large , definitive study , exploratory developmental work focus assess whether blind possible , reproducibility outcome measure , determine enrollment rate effect size identify clinical resource need conduct large study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture Treatment Acute Spinal Cord Injury : Exploratory/Developmental Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research design exploratory/developmental R21 application anticipate design future definitive R01 investigation . A randomized control treatment study use compare neurological recovery spinal cord injury ( SCI ) individual receive acupuncture protocol design maximize treatment effectiveness ( treatment protocol ) alternative acupuncture protocol design minimize treatment effectiveness ( control ) . The two acupuncture protocol identical except 1 ) needle placement , 2 ) use sham , non-penetrating needle 3 ) use electricity needle stimulation . The two protocol design indistinguishable individual , participant remain blind whether receive treatment control protocol . Specific Aim : implement evaluate research protocol demonstrate efficacy Acupuncture Therapy improve neurological recovery incomplete SCI compare control protocol . Hypothesis : acupuncture treatment result great neurological recovery control treatment incomplete SCI . Before propose definitive R01 investigation test hypothesis , several preliminary step require addressed feasibility study . Five objective identify current R21 application follow . Objective 1 - Demonstrate participant unable distinguish treatment control protocols , assure participant blinding . Objective 2 - Verify inter-rater reliability primary outcome measure â€”the American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) motor sensory score define ASIA Standards Neurological Classification SCI.1 Objective 3 - Collect pilot data use power analysis determine desire sample size definitive R01 investigation , include effect size , enrollment dropout rate . Objective 4 - Identify unanticipated difficulty implement treatment control protocols identify clinical resource need conduct R01 investigation . Objective 5 - Prepare application R01 definitive investigation include operation manual protocol .</detailed_description>
