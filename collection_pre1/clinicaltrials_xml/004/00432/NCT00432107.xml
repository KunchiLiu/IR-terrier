	<brief_summary>This phase II study design determine efficacy safety APO866 treatment patient advance cutaneous melanoma . APO866 show induce growth inhibition culture human melanoma cell well animal model subcutaneously implant melanoma tumor . APO866 consider safe well tolerated phase I study treat 24 patient advanced cancer . In study one two patient advance melanoma stable disease 5 month size reduction lesion . APO866 administer intravenous infusion continuously 96 hour repeat every 4 week . Patients receive 3 cycle treatment primary efficacy endpoint assess Week 16 . Patients follow-up 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess APO866 Treatment Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced melanoma one chemo-resistant type human cancer . The incidence increase 2.5 % annual basis , may partially relate age growth population , well environmental risk factor . Virtually recent progress make treatment patient disease . In past 30 year , FDA approve 2 agent , dacarbazine interleukin-2 , basis overall response response duration , respectively . However , outcome accompany survival benefit . The recent randomized study Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) yield overall response rate 7 % , date , treatment , include combination therapy , show improve survival compare DTIC alone . Hence , mainstay treatment patient advance melanoma DTIC-based therapy . APO866 novel drug induces cell death specifically inhibit biosynthesis Niacinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) niacinamide , essential cellular metabolism , protein modification messenger synthesis . APO866 subject commonly know mechanism multi drug resistance ( MDR ) . Its activity cell cycle independent . APO866 exert high anti-tumor activity broad range different tumor cell derive human solid cancer leukemias vitro large number human xenograft nude mouse , include melanoma , rat vivo . Hematologic cancer cell highly sensitive APO866 . Lymphocytes sensitive normal cell APO866 result lymphocytopenia reticulocytopenia rat , monkey . Furthermore , APO866 may anti-angiogenic property show vivo . APO866 investigate 24 patient advanced cancer phase I study aim determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Treatment well tolerate safe . The unique DLT thrombocytopenia . At dose level higher 0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia , think clinically relevant , preceded toxicity . The recommend dose phase II study APO866 0.126 mg/m2/hr administer civ infusion 4 consecutive day evry 4 week . This dose select safety profile , translational observation Css APO866 MTD similar high compare concentration efficacy establish vitro vivo . In addition , transient decrease serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level , surrogate marker angiogenesis , observe within 96 hrs start treatment 9 11 patient treat MTD 0.144 mg/m2/hr dose level APO866 . No objective tumor response observe . However , 4 patient stable disease least 3 month : prostate cancer ( 4 month ) , melanoma ( 5 month ) , sarcomatoid mesothelioma ( 3 month ) oropharyngeal cancer ( 5 month ) . In addition , lesion size reduction observe melanoma patient ( 80 % size reduction stable size lesion ) APO866 dose level 0.072 mg/m2/hr , mesothelioma patient ( moderate size reduction pleural lesion ) 0.108 mg/m2/hr . Treatment APO866 safe well tolerate . The anti-tumor effect APO866 , particular melanoma cell vitro vivo , anti-angiogenic propriety support rationale conduct open phase II study APO866 patient advance melanoma .</detailed_description>
