	<detailed_description>External photon beam radiation therapy ( current standard care ) use treatment retinoblastoma . It form radiation therapy radiation deliver machine point area radiate . Proton beam radiation therapy form external photon beam radiation therapy , may effective adjusted dose delivers le radiation surround area tumor , help preserve tissue cause few side effect . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your eye doctor perform assessment eye , include exam anesthesia . This exam include dilate eye exam , photography affect eye ( Ret-Cam ) , ultrasound affect eye , image scan , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , doctor think necessary . The assessment do check confirm status disease . After diagnosis retinoblastoma , study doctor first see external photon beam radiation therapy reasonable treatment option . If external photon beam radiotherapy deem appropriate , eligible receive proton beam radiation therapy study . If find eligible take part study , treat proton beam radiation therapy . Treatment begin within 1 week referral M. D. Anderson Proton Center . It give daily 5 day row week ( except Saturdays , Sundays , holiday ) . The whole treatment take 4-6 week . Within 2-4 week completion therapy , eye exam perform anesthesia ( like one screening ) . You repeat eye exam anesthesia , depend appearance response tumor therapy . This occur every 1-4 month . You continue eye exam tumor consider stable unless disease get bad . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , may take treatment . You require lifelong eye medical assessment continue monitor disease . If disease find 5 year completion proton beam radiation therapy , consider free disease . You annual ( yearly ) eye pediatric assessment adulthood . This investigational study . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
