	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study evaluate experimental imaging technology , multispectral digital microscope ( MDM ) , may help doctor see far skin cancer extends ( widens ) area skin . Researchers want learn new technology help doctor identify exact area involve precancerous cancerous change skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All tissue cell make tiny particle give small amount light . This light call fluorescence . Researchers learn cancerous cell normal cell give different amount different type fluorescence . Cancerous cell normal cell also reflect ( bounce back ) light differently . Researchers want well understand light fluorescence reflectance ( measure ability material reflect sunlight ) skin use tell cell may cancerous . Researchers develop MDM system order well understand cancer change light fluorescence reflectance skin . The MDM system shine different color light skin take picture fluorescence reflectance skin area microscope . The picture study good understand difference fluorescence reflectance abnormal normal cell . If agree take part study , area skin first examine standard white light . A researcher use MDM imaging instrument take picture abnormal-looking normal skin area . The researcher mark 2-4 area skin marker . During surgery , small sample normal-looking area collect 1 2 sample collect , abnormal-looking area skin . Each sample abnormal-looking tissue 3-4 millimeter wide ( size small pencil eraser ) . After skin lesion remove , need review pathologist surgeon , remove tissue examine use MDM image instrument standard white light . The edge remove lesion examine another type microscope , confocal microscope , allow researcher see small cell tissue . The exact location image microscope mark tissue , finding record . The tissue check pathologist accord standard procedure . You tell experimental finding . Information diagnosis available treat doctor . Your name personal identifying information ( name , social security number , medical record number ) cod protect privacy . This investigational study . Up 55 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
