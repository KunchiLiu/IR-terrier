	<detailed_description>AIDS dementia complex ( ADC ) condition characterize cognitive impairment , psychomotor slowing , behavioral change . A milder form ADC , call HIV minor cognitive/motor disorder ( MCMD ) , characterize similar symptom less impact daily functioning . The neurocognitive impairment result ADC MCMD carry increase risk poor drug adherence , morbidity , mortality . It unclear highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) effective preserve neurocognitive function prevent treat neurocognitive impairment . Distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy ( DSPN ) nucleoside-related neuropathy two serious condition HIV patient high risk . DSPN think cause active HIV infection ; nucleoside-related neuropathy thought cause mitochondrial toxicity relate use certain antiretrovirals . These 2 condition may lead severe pain discomfort foot . It unknown connection , , DSPN nucleoside-related neuropathy use HAART . More data need natural history condition . This trial substudy study management antiretroviral therapy ( SMART ) . In SMART study , patient participate one two strategy : drug conservation ( DC ) strategy viral suppression ( VS ) strategy . Participants DC group stop defer HAART , receive episodic HAART treatment minimum time need maintain CD4 cell count least 250 cells/mm3 . Participants VS group receive HAART maintain viral load low possible , regardless CD4 count . The purpose study compare change neurocognitive function peripheral neuropathy symptom 2 strategy SMART study . Patients participate substudy main SMART study time . Within 45 day prior randomization main SMART study , participant baseline data collect substudy . This data include peripheral neuropathy assessment , treatment symptoms peripheral neuropathy . At select study site , additional measure assess neurocognitive function , depression , alcohol drug use , education . At 6 month , 12 month , every 12 month thereafter , peripheral neuropathy symptom treatment symptom assess ; pain questionnaire also complete . Participants follow SMART study end .</detailed_description>
