	<brief_summary>This study evaluate reflex board training see help people frequently roll ankle . We investigate several test evaluate ability neuromuscular system control ankle movement . This study 2 part : Part 1 look change 1 day reflex training ; Part 2 look change 6 week reflex training . It think reflex training improve measure static dynamic balance well spinal reflex measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research utilized multiple measure effort detect chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) . Recently , investigation focus assessment sensorimotor function suffer CAI . These measure include traditional functional postural control variable , well measure joint position sense , neuromuscular control recruitment , nerve conduction velocity . This study seek modulate sensorimotor measure short- long-term reflex training . This information may help good ass sensorimotor deficit associate CAI , focus future research , evaluate rehabilitation protocol improve understand chronic disability .</detailed_description>
