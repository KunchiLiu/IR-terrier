	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure brain protein call peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) patient multiple sclerosis . PBR create inflammation process , brain inflammation key feature multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . PBR usually affect one type brain cell , also cause damage surround area brain patient MS. PET study PBRs brain inflammation may help elucidate role brain cell patient MS . Healthy normal volunteer patient MS 18 70 year age may eligible study . Patients MS must onset disease 18 40 year age . Patients MS undergo follow procedure : Visit 1 : Medical history , physical examination , blood test magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Visit 2 : Blood test PET scan . Visits 3 4 : MRI physical examination . Visit 5 : PET scan blood test . Visit 6 : MRI physical examination . Healthy volunteer undergo follow : Visit 1 : Medical history , physical examination , blood test . Visits 2 3 : PET blood test . Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , subject lie table slide scanner ( metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knocking noise occur scan process . The procedure last 90 minute ; patient ask lie still 25 minute time . The subject communicate MRI staff time scan . During part scan contrast agent administer catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein enhance image . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) The PET scan give information brain body chemistry function . The subject lie bed slides doughnut-shaped scanner . A catheter place vein arm another place artery wrist elbow area . The catheter arm use inject radioactive material scanner detects , use collect blood sample . A custom-molded plastic mask use support head prevent move procedure . The subject may ask perform various task PET scan lie quietly . The scan last 2.5 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study measure brain peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) expression marker neuroinflammation subject MS use [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET image . Inflammation central nervous system ( CNS ) prominent feature multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , lead cause neurological disability young adult . A complex sequence inflammatory event lead formation new lesion . The disruption blood-brain barrier occur inflammatory cascade basis Gadolinium-DTPA ( Gd-DTPA ) enhance lesion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , currently widely utilized marker neuroinflammation MS . Although Gd-DTPA enhancement correlate acute clinical relapse , limitation biomarker disease activity include relative insensitivity mild degree inflammation lack correlation long-term disability . An alternative marker neuroinflammation may , therefore , informative . Activated microglia macrophage constitute secondary effector cell CNS inflammation MS . Recent study investigate expression peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) CNS show increased expression PBR marker activate microglia/macrophage . Specific ligands PBR allow study activate microglia/macrophage vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) image number setting include inflammatory , ischemic toxic injury CNS . The availability novel PBR ligand [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 develop Molecular Imaging Branch , NIMH , demonstrate great specific signal PBR previously available ligand affords unique opportunity investigate cell-type specific marker neuroinflammation MS. STUDY POPULATION : Subjects definite MS ( McDonald criterion ) evidence brain inflammatory activity indicate presence Gd-DTPA enhance lesion MRI control group consist age-matched healthy volunteer . DESIGN : Up 32 subject MS undergo screen TSPO genotype analysis PCR accrue 16 MS subject confirm high- mixed- affinity bind genotype ( HL HH genotype ) undergo brain [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET MRI image . Subjects MS undergo follow-up brain [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET MRI approximately 4-month interval . Subjects undergo clinical examination PET imaging time point assess clinical measure disability impairment . Up equal number age-matched healthy volunteer undergo screen TSPO genotype analysis PCR . Up 16 healthy volunteer confirm high- mixed- affinity bind genotype ( HL HH genotype ) undergo test retest brain [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET study determine reproducibility [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET healthy population compare MS . OUTCOME MEASURES : The study seek test PBR expression measure [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET image marker neuroinflammation patient MS. Primary outcome measure include 1 ) correlation increase PBR expression gadolinium-enhancing lesion MRI , 2 ) correlation increase PBR expression previously and/or persistently gadolinium-enhancing lesion MRI , 3 ) PBR expression subject multiple sclerosis compare healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
