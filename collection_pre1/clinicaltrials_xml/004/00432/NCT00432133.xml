	<brief_summary>The focus study determine mechanism underlie Physical Activity behavior change . We 2 primary objective . One , test effectiveness brief , practical intervention promote maintain Physical Activity among individual refer treadmill stress test present symptom cardiac disease . Two , test potential individual environmental mediator moderator effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There dearth information mechanism , potential moderator , physical activity ( PA ) intervention effectiveness . Understanding mechanisms PA change aid successful intervention development understand moderator allow match intervention component individual need particular population . To definitively understand mechanism moderator behavior change necessary develop theory-based intervention include specific strategy target propose mechanism change monitor propose mediate moderating variable prior follow intervention . This proposal highlight use Ecological Model Physical Activity ( EMPA ) theoretical guide strategy development . The EMPA highlight necessity address individual ( biological &amp; psychosocial ) environmental variable ( e.g. , PA resource accessibility ) develop implement intervention . Health care patient refer treadmill cardiovascular stress test—but present abnormal ECG chest pain testing—will stratify diagnosis low heart rate recovery , potential biological moderator intervention effectiveness . To detect potential independent combine effect individual motivation environmental accessibility conduct randomize 2X2 factorial trial test propose mediator effectiveness . Participants ( n=500 ) randomize individual ( I ) , environmental ( E ) , combination ( I+E ) , match contact nutrition control . All intervention condition include CD-ROM session , 3 tailored mail , 3 tailor automate telephone follow-ups 6-month period . We assess reach , effectiveness , clinician adoption , staff implementation intervention , individually , combination , compare control among understudied high need population—individuals elevate risk , yet suffer serious cardiac event ( approximately 3,000,000 individuals/year US ) . The result project identify causal , potentially additive , relationship environmental individual mediator PA change allow examination potential biological moderator effectiveness . Because intervention typically effect decrease time study address setting-related issue necessary ensure sustainability delivery organizational level determine maintenance intervention effect causal mechanisms PA , 6 &amp; 12 month follow intervention . The intervention develop delivery within regular scope treadmill stress test typical medical staff cost delivery assess intervention condition . This project uniquely utilizes method facilitate institutionalization intervention component follow successful completion trial potential adoption intervention health care setting .</detailed_description>
