	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Pancrecarb® MS-16 Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic insufficiency ( PI ) common pathologic condition occur approximately 90 % patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Pancreatic insufficiency characterize pancreatic enzyme bicarbonate insufficiency . Consequently , maldigestion occur variety essential nutrient lose stool , especially fat fat soluble vitamin . As result , patient often experience growth failure malnutrition . Effective correction maldigestion critical survival well-being patient . Several strength PANCRECARB® ( pancrelipase ) ( i.e. , MS4 , MS8 , MS16 ) available used patient CF decade . The digestive enzyme PANCRECARB® ( pancrelipase ) act locally gastrointestinal tract . The active enzyme hydrolyze fat glycerol fatty acid , protein peptides amino acid , starch dextrin maltose . PANCRECARB® ( pancrelipase ) potential promote increase lipase activity efficient fat digestion . Efficient fat digestion important CF may lead improved nutritional pulmonary status ultimately improve quality life enhance survival . PANCRECARB® MS-8 ( pancrelipase ) compare enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate efficacy reduce steatorrhea patient CF . Differences fat excretion , subject receive PANCRECARB® MS-8 ( pancrelipase ) versus enteric-coated enzyme without bicarbonate , compare use linear modeling . Mean fat excretion decrease significantly subject receive PANCRECARB® MS-8 ( pancrelipase ) compare enteric-coated enzyme without bicarbonate . This study design accordance FDA 2006 guideline exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug product . Assuming result study demonstrate therapy PANCRECARB® MS-16 ( pancrelipase ) result clinically statistically significant improvement fat absorption relative placebo subject CF pancreatic insufficiency , study result part submission marketing approval PANCRECARB® ( pancrelipase ) . The study consist two treatment period 72-hour stool collection separate washout period . Study subject require consume diet high fat content .</detailed_description>
