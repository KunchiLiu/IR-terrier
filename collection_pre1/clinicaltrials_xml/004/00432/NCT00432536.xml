	<brief_summary>Neurologic injury frequent devastate complication follow cardiac surgery . Previous work conduct research group others identify principal mechanism create overt subtle neurologic injury cardiac surgery . Current work group identify cause ( thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus ) injuries byproducts process surgical perfusion care . This insight suggest redesign clinical strategy techniques prevent occurrence intraoperative source damage may provide opportunity reduce risk neurologic injury cardiac surgery . The goal research identify modifiable clinical strategy techniques surgical perfusion care associate cause ( thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus ) neurologic injury secondary coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , subsequently redesign process reduce patient 's risk neurologic injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal research identify modifiable clinical strategy techniques surgical perfusion care associate cause ( thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus ) neurologic injury secondary coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , subsequently redesign process reduce patient 's risk neurologic injury . The following hypothesis address . Hypothesis # 1a . Identifying alternative strategy conduct process surgical perfusion care reveal opportunity reduce occurrence cause neurologic injury . The common mechanism create neurologic injury , whether focal global , CABG surgery thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus . Processes surgical perfusion care associate creation cause neurologic injury . Hypothesis # 1b . Redesigning process surgical perfusion care reduce thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus CABG surgery result reduction tissue-level neurologic injury . We analyze sera tissue-level brain injury well identify new neurologic injury present among patient undergo CABG surgery . Redesigning CABG surgery reduce thrombotic/lipid embolus , cerebral hypoperfusion &amp; hypotension , gaseous embolus result decrease tissue-level neurologic injury . Hypothesis # 2 . A regional quality improvement intervention result change surgical perfusion technique . Regional dissemination finding Hypotheses # 1a , b may realize focused quality improvement initiative utilize multidisciplinary clinical team .</detailed_description>
