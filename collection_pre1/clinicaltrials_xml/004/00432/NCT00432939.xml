	<brief_summary>This research study investigate cardiovascular health people mild hyperparathyroidism . Previous research suggest severe hyperparathyroidism may associate abnormality heart blood vessel . It unclear whether mild hyperparathyroidism affect cardiovascular health . This study involve investigation heart blood vessel people mild hyperparathyroidism . Various non-invasive laboratory radiological test ass cardiovascular bone health do set interval course 2 year . It hypothesis patient primary hyperparathyroidism subtle abnormality cardiovascular system . Using state-of-the art technique sufficiently sensitive detect subtle abnormality , define cardiovascular feature disease , , elude clear definition . We expect taht extent finding relate severity underlie primary hyperparathyroidism . We hypothesize cardiovascular manifestation may regress successful cure hyperparathyroid state .</brief_summary>
