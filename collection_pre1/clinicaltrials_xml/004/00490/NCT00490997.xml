	<detailed_description>Purpose : Procedural sedation become essential skill emergency physician , allow completion painful procedure safe , comfortable efficient manner . The ideal sedative agent would allow effective level sedation , rapid onset offset , absence hemodynamic respiratory compromise , lack post procedural side effect . A variety agent study paediatric procedural sedation , however currently use agent meet criteria ( 1 ) . Background : Ketamine Propofol two agent well study commonly utilized single agent sedation . Ketamine dissociative agent amnestic analgesic quality . It unique property allow deep sedation minimal effect patient 's respiratory drive . Ketamine use cause hypotension fact positive effect blood pressure . Ketamine extensively study paediatric sedation find safe effective ( 2,3,4 ) . Side effect associate Ketamine use include post procedural nausea vomiting , unpleasant emergence phenomenon agitation hallucination . Ketamine sedation result prolong recovery time compare sedative agent low rate respiratory depression , apnea laryngospasm ( 1 ) . Propofol sedative-hypnotic agent popular use adult paediatric procedural sedation decade . The agent 's rapid onset effect short duration action allow efficient sedation recovery . Propofol antiemetic property post-procedural side effect rare . Caution must use Propofol , associate significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension ( 1 ) . The prolonged use Propofol child produce acidosis , problem single use acute painful procedure . A number study demonstrate combination Ketamine Propofol sedation safe effective , data adult adult-child study small number child ( 5,6 ) . The combination two agent appear reduce side effect medication use alone , allow rapid recovery time . A prospective case series Canadian emergency department patient give Ketamine-Propofol procedural sedation recently publish ( 5 ) . In study , 22 % patient child . However , date target research publish compare Ketamine-Propofol head head presently utilized sedation regimen paediatric emergency department set . Objective &amp; Hypothesis : The objective study compare Ketamine-Propofol Ketamine-only double-blind , randomise , control trial paediatric emergency department . We believe combination two agent provide novel efficacious option procedural sedation paediatric emergency department patient . The hypothesis study paediatric emergency department patient require procedural sedation isolate orthopaedic injury Ketamine-Propofol reduce time recovery , complication improve satisfaction score compare patient receive Ketamine alone . Experimental Design : This study prospective , double-blind , randomise , control clinical trial expect enrolment approximately 140 patient June-October 2007. n = 2 * ( Z1-α/2 + Z1-β ) 2 * σ2 / ∆2 n = 2 * ( 1.96 + 0.84 ) 2 * 202 / 102 n = 2 * 7.84 * 400 / 100 n = 62.7 63 per group Based calculation , 63 child need group 80 % chance detect clinically meaningful difference recovery time 10 minute group , assume alpha 0.05 , standard deviation 20 minute . We add additional 7 patient ( 10 % ) group account potential drop-outs . Written , inform consent obtain parent/guardian child meet study inclusion criterion . Additionally , child age eight also ask assent . Interventions : After give informed consent , eligible patient assign either Ketamine-Propofol group Ketamine-placebo group random allocation . Sealed envelope contain randomized assignment either Ketamine-Propofol Ketamine-only group prepare individual unconnected study use web-based random number generator , balanced ensure equal allocation group . Patients Ketamine-only group receive intravenous dose 1.0 mg/kg Ketamine patient Ketamine-Propofol group receive intravenous dose 0.5 mg/kg Ketamine 1.0 mg/kg Propofol time zero . Two minute initial dose sedative agent , every 2 minute thereafter , attend physician ass patient 's level sedation use Children 's Hospital Wisconsin Sedation Scale ( Appendix A ) . If attend physician determines level sedation adequate ( Sedation score ≥ 3 ) , additional study drug ( Ketamine group : 0.25 mg/kg Ketamine ; Ketamine-Propofol group : 0.5 mg/kg Propofol ) administer every 2 minute adequate sedation achieve ( deep conscious sedation = Children 's Hospital Wisconsin Sedation Scale Score &lt; 3 ) . Once sedation score &lt; 3 achieve , procedure begin . All sedation perform continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring base current hospital guideline care surveillance pediatric emergency department register nurse physician . Vital sign include heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate oxygen saturation monitor continuously record every 2 minute , exception blood pressure , record every 4 minute . The assisting register nurse also record information regard time last liquid solid intake body weight hospital 's standard procedural sedation analgesia record form . A separate , standardized datasheet ( Appendix B ) use collect time study drug first administer , time procedure begin , time procedure complete time recovery . Upon completion procedure , recovery score base modify Aldrete Scale , record research associate blind intervention use every 2 minute full recovery , define minimum cumulative score 8 . The attend physician ask document complication ( include hypotension , apnea , hypoxia , laryngospasm pain injection ) occur procedure intervention necessary . The nurse caring patient also record adverse event ( nausea , vomit , agitation ) occur recovery . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome recovery time , define time last study drug inject patient fully recover minimum recovery score ≥ 8 . Secondary outcome include time procedure start ; patient , nurse , physician satisfaction ; complication adverse event . The patient , nurse physician ask individually assess level satisfaction sedation procedure use 7-point Likert scale ( Appendices C-E ) . Analyses Strategy : The independent sample t-test use compare difference mean recovery time Ketamine Ketamine-Propofol group . The Mann-Whitney test use compare difference satisfaction level ( measure ordinal scale ) group . Differences proportion complication procedure adverse event recovery assess Chi-Square test group . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Expectation : The expectation study paediatric emergency department patient require procedural sedation isolate orthopaedic injury Ketamine-Propofol reduce time recovery , complication improve satisfaction score compare patient receive Ketamine alone .</detailed_description>
