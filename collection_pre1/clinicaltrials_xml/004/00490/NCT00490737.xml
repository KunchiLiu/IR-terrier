	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluate Daptomycin Non-Infected Adults Who Are Either Hemodialysis Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients moderate severe renal insufficiency ( CLcr &lt; 50 mL/min ) increase risk infection , also bad outcomes give infection . In fact , infection account second leading cause mortality among patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Many infection due sepsis , primarily rise vascular access peritoneal catheter sit . This open label , non-randomized , non-comparative Phase 1 study design evaluate PK profile , safety tolerability i.v . daptomycin . Non-infected subject end stage renal disease undergo HD CAPD enrol in-patient study .</detailed_description>
