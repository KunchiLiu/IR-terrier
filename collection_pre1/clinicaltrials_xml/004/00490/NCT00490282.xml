	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study use compute tomography ( CT ) scan measure guide radiation therapy . Researchers want learn CT scan use adapt radiation therapy change normal tissue shrink tumor may occur reaction radiation therapy . Researchers also want see magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan detect certain change tumor early standard test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Image-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Scans Tests : IMRT type 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) radiation therapy focus radiation beam directly tumor . In study , IMRT give use standard radiation machine ( ExaCT™ machine ) CT scanner attach . This machine commonly use patient head neck cancer . It give radiation treatment machine M. D. Anderson . However , addition give radiation treatment , also perform CT scan patient position treatment table , radiation therapy give . For study , standard care daily CT scan use help researcher adjust participant ' radiation therapy , necessary , weekly basis . In particular , change normal tissue study change salivary gland . An additional research relate MRI scan also perform study , MRI scan use adjust participant ' therapy . Researchers want learn MRI scanning may able help doctor future adjust someone 's treatment base change tumor ( feature size ) response radiation . Enrollment Study : If agree take part study , receive IMRT accord standard schedule ( 6 - 7 week ) . You sign separate consent form IMRT , procedure risk explain time . CT Scans : During study , standard care CT scan right IMRT treatment ( 6-7 week period time , depend exact schedule doctor decides would best treatment ) . These CT scan standard care , use make sure treatment aim properly , would perform whether participate trial . Once set treatment table ready radiation therapy , table turn around CT scan perform . After CT scan , take 5-8 minute , table turn back around original position radiation treatment give . In total , 30-33 CT scan perform study , depend exact number treatment doctor decides would best therapy . Routine MRI Scans : Routine MRI scan head neck perform treatment ( Week 1 ) treatment ( sometime Weeks 12-14 ) . These scan may use routine treatment plan check status disease . Study-Related MRI Scan : An additional MRI scan do halfway treatment ( Week 3 ) . This MRI scan use help researcher see MRI scan may able help doctor future adjust someone 's treatment base change tumor ( feature size ) response radiation . In 15 participant , repeat baseline study-related MRI scan do 48 hour 1 week follow first routine MRI scan . Modified Barium Swallow : Your swallow function test special type x-ray call modify barium swallow ( MBS ) . During test , eat drink food liquids mixed `` contrast '' chemical call barium make throat visible x-ray . A special x-ray tube connect television screen allow doctor watch food liquid pass mouth throat . MBS perform start radiation therapy , 4-6 month end radiation therapy , routine follow-up visit , 12 month ( plus minus 2 month ) , 24 month ( plus minus 3 month ) . Saliva Testing : One reason IMRT use try protect parotid gland ( large salivary gland ) receive much radiation . To check , study-related saliva test do . For test , amount saliva parotid gland create measure treatment ( within 7 day Week 1 ) last week treatment ( Week 6 7 ) . Do eat drink anything , put anything mouth , 1 hour saliva collection . You ask let saliva collect mouth 5 minute spit cup . After , give mild citric acid solution ( like lemon juice ) put mouth . You let saliva collect mouth 5 minute spit cup . Saliva test perform separate protocol ( LAB07-0050 ) . Length Study : If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study . Follow-Up Visits : At time Weeks 22 24 , every 3-4 month 2 year last IMRT , return follow-up visit . The amount saliva parotid gland create measure 6 week radiation therapy , 4-6 month radiation therapy , 1 year ( plus minus 2 month ) radiation therapy , 2 year ( plus minus 3 month ) radiation therapy . This investigational study . The ExaCT™ machine FDA approve use IMRT patient head neck cancer . Researchers use standard care CT Scan routine quality assurance make sure treatment give correctly . Up 45 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
