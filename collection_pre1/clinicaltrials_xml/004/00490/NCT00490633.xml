	<brief_summary>Pharmaceutical intervention , particularly vaccination , principal public health method prevent control seasonal influenza . Other less invasive non-pharmaceutical intervention include use face mask hand hygiene . In Asia , mask use extensively , especially Japan , circumstantial evidence efficacy . Although numerous study support hand hygiene effective measure decrease transmission enteric infection , few data assess effect hand hygiene respiratory illness . Therefore propose study conduct use face mask without use hand hygiene comparison intervention residence housing unit University Michigan . The intervention carry period influenza transmission define surveillance conduct University Health Service . Data collect use intervention occurrence influenza illness . When illness occurs meet case definition , specimens viral isolation collect intervention setting . Face mask could theoretically lead large reduction transmission frequency influenza , especially transmission occurs airborne ( large small droplet ) route . Even modest reduction could major effect influenza pandemic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall objective study investigate feasibility effectiveness various non-pharmaceutical intervention occurrence influenza residence unit University Michigan . Specific Aims : The three specific aim study : ( 1 ) determine feasibility use face mask hand hygiene education among student live residence hall unit University Michigan , ( 2 ) estimate reduction influenza infection illness laboratory document influenza outbreaks individual group use one intervention compare use intervention , ( 3 ) track occurrence influenza case participate residence unit University . Background : Community base intervention study target prevention droplet transmission , via face mask addition hand-to-hand transmission along alcohol-based antiseptic use , need along culture confirm respiratory illness data . Methodology : The propose study randomize intervention design examine effectiveness face mask alone layer face mask hand hygiene intervention reduce transmission influenza among student reside University Michigan residence hall laboratory define influenza season . Randomization geographically separate housing unit . In first year , residence hall assign intervention observe comparison bring total number participant 750 intervention comparison ( total number : 2250 ) . For year two , randomization perform residence house level increase cluster unit also aim 750 student intervention . Students live residence hall ask wish participate study . Those give informed consent ask complete survey week ascertain illness occurrence . When influenza illness document occur University setting , intervention implement . During period , survey expand include question intervention use , appropriate particular housing unit . Also period , illnesses meet case definition ask provide specimen virus identification . This collection limit agree use intervention , since inform consent obtain specimen collection . Intervention Methods : Randomization cluster residence hall since likely incidence influenza infection correlate among subject within residence hall . In year 2 , cluster do residence house increase cluster unit . The intervention residence hall receive one follow two intervention : ( ) mask alone ( ii ) mask plus alcohol-based hand sanitizers ( 62 % ethyl alcohol ) hygiene education . The remain hall serve comparison unit . The control dorms similar intervention dorm basic demographic distribution , age range geographical proximity . Residence halls randomize control arm receive mask , hygiene education material , alcohol-based hand sanitizer . Within randomized residence hall assign receive intervention , goal ass use face mask hand sanitizer . The intervention put effect two virus positive illness detect single week . Rapid test available help identifying case laboratory confirmation may delay . The use face mask continue outbreak recognize virology come close passage 6 week , whichever occur first . It felt need guarantee duration order assure compliance face mask use . Face Mask : Residence hall receive intervention ( ) ( ii ) receive face mask ask comply use least residence hall know influenza virus transmit campus . A week 's supply face mask plastic bag disposal bundle along instruction use . They request wear mask hall , may difficult implement . As indicated , ask proportion time mask wear . The choice specific face mask carry conjunction CDC project officer . The face mask intervention would require day change use ensure proper protection hygienic barrier . It clear recent Institute Medicine report little know long term use reuse face mask , variation number time face mask change variable could assess study . The use face mask continue 6 week . Instructions give correct incorrect way utilize surgical mask . As part evaluation level use , staff observer facility estimate proportion individual actually use properly . This take place common room , hallway , residence hall din facility supplement self report collect e-mail participant . Hand Hygiene Education Antiseptic Product Use : All student residence hall receive intervention ( ii ) provide comprehensive hand hygiene education component addition mask use . The educational component include poster pamphlet provide background information transmission influenza , explanation effectiveness hand hygiene reduce transmission , guideline proper hand hygiene , include need hand hygiene critical location throughout residence hall . The hand wash campaign consist poster bulletin board weekly email hand hygiene reminder message participant intervention residence hall . The educational component study include video control arm intervention arm . The control video address information influenza overview study . The intervention video address information influenza overview study , addition hand hygiene education use hand sanitizer use face mask . Both video available website ( www.mflu.org ) Survey Monkey link consent form . The intervention dorm give portable alcohol-based hand sanitizer large stationary pump alcohol-based hand sanitizer use throughout study period addition basic hand hygiene education material message . In order quantify effect alcohol-based hand sanitizer use influenza virus transmission , regular self report hand-sanitizer use collect product provide monitor use ( weigh ) re-supplied needed weekly basis influenza season . Control participant also require provide information type name product use daily frequency use , use . Control Residence Halls : Students reside control housing unit ask participate disease surveillance aspect study . They contact e-mail , ask consent participate wellness study report respiratory enteric illness symptom weekly basis . The student compensate participation level intervention arm . Hand Hygiene , Face Mask Illness Surveillance : Participants intervention control housing unit ask report information weekly basis concern use intervention ( appropriate ) occurrence respiratory enteric illness symptom . Questions health attitude knowledge collect start end study season . This survey modify residence hall participant frequency use face mask similarly determine , include attitude wear . Both intervention compliance outcome measure collect via electronic survey . This include mask use , alcohol-based hand sanitizer use , detail regard respiratory symptom enteric symptom . During first year , survey instrument assess reliability use among target student population residence hall may modify second year . Honoraria calculate base week report complete , pay end season . Collection Specimens Virus Identification : All resident intervention comparison residence receive small magnetic card , modify currently use vaccine study , describe case definition . An individual ask specimen collect virus identification whenever illness meet case definition occur . Information symptom , duration illness relevant characteristic obtain . Laboratory Methods Virus Identification : All specimen virus identification collect throat swab place veal infusion broth transport medium . This transport medium find protect virus day shipment remote site suitable PCR test well . Positives pass additional tube cell culture . Initial type carried fluorescent antibody technique . Subtyping type A virus carry hemagglutination-inhibition . For specimen collect influenza vaccine efficacy study , specimen also process real time PCR . By collect data vaccination use among participant , able control vaccine use study analysis . Given low rate vaccination uptake among college age individual , expect vaccine use significant confounder study design . Statistical Design : To estimate reduction influenza infection illness laboratory document influenza outbreaks individual group use one intervention compare use intervention . The effect intervention test use generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) apply statistical regression model cluster data . The main outcome aim rate influenza case rate secondary influenza transmission compare intervention control dormitory . Additional outcome include non-influenza respiratory illness enteric illness symptom . Predictor variable include main effect intervention control potential confounders depend upon balance know confounders across intervention control residence hall .</detailed_description>
