	<brief_summary>For 25 year WHO UNICEF recommend single formulation glucose-based Oral Rehydration Salts ( ORS ) prevent treat dehydration diarrhoea irrespective cause age group affect . This product proven effective contribute substantially dramatic global reduction mortality diarrhoeal disease period . Based two decade research recommendation expert group , WHO UNICEF review effectiveness new ORS formula reduce concentration glucose salt . Because improved effectiveness new ORS solution WHO UNICEF recommend country use manufacture new formulation place old one . While recommend new ORS expert also recommend monitoring desirable good ass risk , symptomatic hyponatraemia ( low blood level sodium salt ) . This surveillance study evaluate adverse effect routinely use new ORS hospital admit 20,000 patient diarrhea age include cholera . If new ORS find safe , provide add confidence global use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Hypo-Osmolar ORS ( Recommended WHO ) Routine Use Diarrhea Management– Surveillance Study Adverse Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It Phase IV surveillance study adverse effect , particularly symptomatic hyponatraemia associate routine use hypo-osmolar ORS solution treatment diarrhoea patient age aetiology hospital admits large number diarrhoea patient . Objectives : To monitor symptomatic hyponatraemia complete year hospital treat large number patient diarrhoea include cholera patient treat low osmolarity ORS Study Design : It phase IV surveillance study adverse effect , particularly symptomatic hyponatraemia associate routine use hypo-osmolar ORS solution treatment diarrhoea patient age aetiology hospital admits large number diarrhoea patient . Hypo-osmolar ORS recommend WHO routinely use patient admitted hospital admits large number diarrhoea patient include cholera . The hospital serve metropolitan city ’ suburbs know endemic cholera . Hypothesis : We hypothesise routine use recommend hypo-osmolar ORS associate significantly incidence rate symptomatic hyponatraemia . Study Site Population : The study conduct Infectious Diseases Hospital , Beliaghata , Kolkata . This hospital admit diarrhoea patient age include cholera . The hospital 3 diarrhoea ward , one adult men , one adult woman one child . It designate hospital admit clinically suspect cholera patient great Calcutta . Of total diarrhoea admission 1995 2002 , little 25 % child five , Duration : Total duration study 18 month . Study subject : The ID Hospital admit approximately 23,000 patient diarrhoea year year 2001 2002 . We expect similar number patient diarrhoea admit study period . We expect 25 percent five child . Based many clinical trial hypo-osmolar ORS formulation , expect symptomatic hypotraemia rare event . Inclusion Criteria : All patient admit diarrhoea study period 12 month eligible study , include men , woman child . Surveillances adverse event : Medical Officers duty Diarrhoea Ward I.D . Hospital , supervision clinician scientist look development symptom like seizure , lethargy alter consciousness , mark irritability ( i.e. , irritable touch ) . The investigation patient include determination blood glucose bedside , serum electrolyte , presence fever . The decision spinal tap leave clinician in-charge patient hospital . CSF blood culture do indicate . Serum electrolyte measurement make available round clock . Data analysis : Adverse event particular reference seizure , mark lethargy alter consciousness record . Their relation hyponatraemia assess rate event associate hyponatraemia compare ( 95 % confidence interval calculate ) record precede 12 month patient receive standard WHO ORS 90 mmol/L sodium . Primary outcome measure : Symptomatic hyponatraemia . It define biochemical hyponatraemia associate clinical feature like convulsion drowsiness coma . A serum sodium le 130 mmol/L consider hyponatraemia serum level less 125 mmol/L consider severe hyponatraemia . Ethical Issues : The study conduct accord good clinical practice Declaration Helsinki Indian Council Medical Research Guidelines .</detailed_description>
