	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety oral extended-release ( ER ) paliperidone compare placebo prevention recurrence mood symptom patient Bipolar I Disorder initially respond treatment acute manic mixed episode paliperidone ER . Olanzapine include active control arm , although study design allow direct comparison olanzapine paliperidone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Extended-Release ( ER ) Paliperidone Compared With Placebo Delaying Recurrence Symptoms Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate efficacy ( effectiveness ) safety paliperidone ER relative placebo prevention recurrent mood symptom associate Bipolar I Disorder . There 5 phase study : screening phase ( last 7 day ) establish subject 's eligibility study , ; 3-week double-blind acute treatment phase treat acute manic episode ; 12-week double-blind treatment continuation phase establish patient 's clinical stability , ; double-blind treatment maintenance phase measure time symptom recurrence last patient experience recurrence , ; follow-up phase consist visit approximately 1 week last study visit . All antipsychotic drug mood stabilizer study drug must discontinue first study drug administration . Hospitalization require least first 7 day acute treatment phase . At begin acute treatment phase , patient randomly assign receive ER paliperidone olanzapine 4:1 ratio . Patients ER paliperidone group clinical response end acute treatment phase , remain clinically stable throughout continuation phase , achieve remission last 3 week continuation phase randomly assign : assign 1:1 ratio receive ER paliperidone placebo maintenance phase . Patients olanzapine treatment group fulfill criterion continue receive double-blind treatment olanzapine maintenance phase . Measures efficacy use Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Clinical Global Impression - Bipolar Disorder - Severity Illness Scale ( CGI-BP-S ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , Short Form-36 measure health-related functional status , sleep visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , clinical laboratory test ( include urine pregnancy test hemoglobin A1c ) , 12-lead ECG , vital sign measurement , measurement orthostatic change pulse blood pressure , physical examination ( include height , body weight , waist circumference ) , monitor extrapyramidal symptom use Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , Simpson Angus Scale ( SAS ) . In addition , Scale Suicidal Ideation administer assess suicidality . The primary hypothesis study , long-term treatment patient Bipolar I Disorder maintain clinical stability acute manic mixed episode , ER paliperidone superior placebo delay time recurrence mood symptom associate Bipolar I Disorder . Patients begin acute treatment phase 6.0 mg/day oral ER paliperidone 10 mg/day oral olanzapine . Dosages may adjust , need , 3 12 mg/day ER paliperidone 5 20 mg/day olanzapine , end continuation phase . Then , maintenance phase , patient receive dosage ER paliperidone ( ER paliperidone placebo ) olanzapine reach end continuation phase . They remain dosages end study .</detailed_description>
