	<brief_summary>Given asthma result complex interaction genetic susceptibility environmental factor rate childhood asthma increasing , primary prevention focus modifiable aspect nutrition . There implication epidemiology food supplementation probiotic give atopic mother pregnancy lactation prevent development allergy offspring . Children atopic dermatitis increase risk ( 80 % ) develop persistent respiratory tract disease . Our trial examine whether probiotic able prevent allergic sensitization allergic asthma give 6-24 month old infant increase risk allergy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In investigator-initiated prospective study , total 170 child least two episode wheeze first degree family history atopic disease recruit walk-in clinic October 2002 October 2004 . We choose relatively long period time exclude seasonal selection bias ( e.g. , upper airway infection airborne allergen ) . 131 eligible child ( 6 24 month old ) randomly assign double-blind dietary supplementation Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG ATCC 53103 ( LGG ) twice daily placebo six month . A computerized randomization schedule prepare biostatistician allocation dispense capsule distributor LGG . The capsule match size , shape , volume content , reconstitute 5 ml water give spoon . Compliance monitor use capsule chart ( complete parent ) capsule count . The parent ask keep diary provide study group . Clinical monitoring do one year : intervention ( visit 1 ) , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month ( visit 2 5 ) . It encompass episode asthmatic exacerbation define cough wheeze , number day associate hospitalization , symptom free day , day without use rescue medication ( steroid suppositoria , frequently use device Western Europe ) , associate inhalative steroid beta-agonist use . Children underwent physical examination include determination severity score atopic dermatitis ( SCORAD ) index assess eczema severity examination study visit walk-in clinic . To ensure consistency , investigator perform SCORAD assessment . Atopic eczema confirm characteristical cutaneous finding , pruritus , chronic relapse course . This last criterion fulfil child present eczema least one month least one visit . Asthma diagnosis base algorithm international paediatric asthma consensus group . Asthma diagnose child chronic recurrent cough , wheeze shortness breath , , diagnosis exclude trial antiasthmatic treatment effective . Blood sample take visit 1 , 3 , 5 . Sensitization common dietary respiratory allergen measure total antigen specific IgE assay hen ’ egg , cat epithelium , house dust mite ( D1+2 ) , birch pollen , milk protein , lactalbumin , timothy pollen , horse epithelia alternaria chemiluminescence-immunoassay . This highly-sensitive assay suitable especially determination low value specific IgE . Additionally , eosinophilic cationic protein eosinophil determine . Primary outcome measure asthma-related clinical event . Secondary measure serum concentration IgE , specific IgE , ECP , Eos , IL-2 soluble receptor alpha ( IL-2Rα , reflect T-cell related inflammatory state ) transform growth factor beta ( TGFβ , profibrotic factor whose expression increase asthmatic , indicate airway remodel . All parent supply write informed consent prior study . Human experimentation guideline Good Clinical Practice , German Drug Act declaration Helsinki / Hong Kong follow conduct clinical research .</detailed_description>
