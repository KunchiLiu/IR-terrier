	<brief_summary>The purpose research study understand effect male hormone normally make body call Dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) prostate gland locate bladder . The knowledge gain study may use help future develop safe male hormonal contraceptive prevent pregnancy , safe treatment low male hormone level men , treatment prevention diseases prostate . The investigator give DHT gel form , applied skin , placebo gel ( active drug ) . The investigator want see effect DHT level hormone blood prostate gland . In addition , investigator study effect DHT cell gene express within prostate . The effect DHT prostate know . Some study suggest block production DHT prostate help growth gland age ( condition know benign prostatic hyperplasia , BPH short ) may prevent prostate cancer . On hand , DHT administration may shrink prostate , suggest may beneficial men . Therefore , study look effect DHT prostate need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , examine vivo effect DHT supplementation prostate serum inflammatory marker molecular level . We hypothesize increase serum DHT increase intraprostatic DHT prostate epithelial proliferation , associate decrease marker systemic inflammation . Normal , healthy , male study volunteer treat either placebo gel ( Group 1 ) DHT gel ( Group 2 ) one month . Serum hormonal inflammatory measurement assess , , treatment , relationship hormone inflammatory marker associate cardiovascular risk determine . Prostate biopsy take one month treatment . Prostate tissue analyze change intraprostatic hormone level well gene expression follow treatment . SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To determine effect increase serum DHT , without concomitant increase serum T estrogen , intraprostatic androgen level . 2 . To determine effect increase serum DHT , without concomitant increase serum T estrogen , prostate epithelial gene expression . 3 . To determine effect increase serum DHT , without concomitant increase serum T estrogen , serum lipid inflammatory marker include C-Reactive Protein [ CRP ] , Tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNFÎ± ] , Interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] , adiponectin , plasminogen activator inhibitor [ PAI-I ] , leptin . We test hypothesis normal men ( rather hypogonadal men ) `` proof principle '' investigation . A normal hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis regulation , circulate T DHT level intraprostatic androgen concentration healthy , normal men permit optimal test hypothesis . Exogenous DHT administration normal men expect suppress endogenous gonadotropin testosterone secretion , compare variable effect hypogonadal men depend degree hypogonadism men whether primary ( testicular ) secondary ( hypothalamic-pituitary ) hypogonadism . Furthermore , intraprostatic T DHT concentration 5 alpha-reductase activity ( androgen-dependent ) expect variable hypogonadal men , depend degree androgen deficiency circulate T DHT level . If result normal men support hypothesis , subsequent study could perform hypogonadal men . Because large variability circulate probably intraprostatic androgen concentration hypogonadal men , study require much large number subject .</detailed_description>
