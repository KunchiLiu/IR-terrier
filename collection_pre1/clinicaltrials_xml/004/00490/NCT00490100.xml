	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) treat patient X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) . Those XSCID lack white blood cell protect body invasion type germ . IGF-1 main hormone responsible body 's growth metabolism . As medication , IGF-1 Increlex [ ( Trademark ) ] ( mecasermin ) , Patients age 2 20 yet begin puberty , diagnosis XSCID , short 3rd percentile age may eligible study . This study last 3 year , patient ' visit schedule 3-month interval . Patients physical history exam , X-rays , electrocardiogram , blood test , body measurement . Patients take estradiol orally 2 day , help avoid false result growth hormone ( GH ) level blood sample . Then provocation test do , two test back back . It determine blood level GH body 's response testing drug call arginine clonidine . Patients admit pediatric inpatient unit intravenous ( IV ) line place arm . Arginine give IV 30 minute , blood sample take . Right arginine testing , clonidine tablet give . The IGF-1 generation test do see body make IGF-1 product response injection GH 5 consecutive day . This test require patient inpatient , Day 8 , patient must admit pediatric unit blood sampling , start Increlex injection , start close monitoring blood sugar level . They learn self-injection follow advice . They complete record injection site , symptom , side effects-keeping record least first 2 day go home , dose change , need . Patients stick fingertip place small drop blood blood sugar monitoring strip . The strip put glucometer-a small hand-held device measure blood sugar level . Patients instruct always source sugar available case blood sugar low .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Growth Failure Patients With X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency : Phase 2 Study Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 protocol evaluate safety efficacy standard dose insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) treatment growth failure patient diagnose X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) . This condition fatal inherit immunodeficiency cause defect common cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gc ) , subunit share many cytokine receptor . The common gamma subunit signal Janus kinase/signal transducer activator transcription ( JAK/STAT ) pathway , complex intracellular signal pathway use many cytokine growth factor , include growth hormone ( GH ) . Studies suggest gc defect may result hyporesponsiveness GH . This supported report GH hyporesponsiveness XSCID child successfully ameliorate follow immune reconstitution use bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . Haplo-identical BMTs XSCID child often achieve partial immune reconstitution , many BMT recipient experience ongoing problem growth failure , achieve height well 2 standard deviation chronological age . It possible partially correct condition , administration IGF-1 , substance body produce downstream response GH , may achieve improved growth response . This study propose evaluate safety efficacy Increlex ( Trademark ) ( recombinant human IGF-1 ) treatment patient XSCID growth failure ( child height le 3rd percentile age ) . Increlex ( Trademark ) Food Drug Administration-approved drug treatment growth hormone non-responsiveness general population child growth hormone hyporesponsiveness primary IGF-1 deficiency . The scientific objective determine safety ass efficacy use subcutaneous IGF-1 XSCID patient growth failure . The long-term goal study establish improve treatment regimens growth failure child XSCID .</detailed_description>
