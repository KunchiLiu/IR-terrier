	<criteria>General Clinical Subject ≥18 year age . Subject subject 's physician agree subject return require contact follow study enrollment . Subject inform nature study , provide write informed consent , approve appropriate Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) respective clinical site . Subject candidate renal artery stenting . Subject uncontrolled systolic hypertension ( systolic Blood Pressure [ SBP ] ≥140 mmHg ) , uncontrolled diastolic hypertension ( diastolic BP [ DBP ] ≥90 mmHg ) , combination presence least two ( 2 ) antihypertensive medication . Subject baseline serum Creatinine &lt; 2.5mg/dl Angiographic Inclusion Criteria Subject either unilateral bilateral de novo restenotic Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( PTA ) ( instent restenosis exclude ) atherosclerotic lesion ( ) . If bilateral lesion treat , severe lesion must successfully treat without complication progress treat second lesion . Treatment bilateral lesion occur procedural event . Renal stenosis must visually estimate ≥60 % angiography . Subject suboptimal PTA result , define one following : ≥50 % residual stenosis 10 mm Hg mean gradient 20 mm Hg peak systolic gradient across target lesion A flowlimiting dissection ( NHLBI grade D ) TIMI flow &lt; 3 Renal stenosis must visually estimate within 10 mm aortic renal border angiography . Target vessel reference diameter must visually estimate ≥4mm ≤7mm angiography Target lesion length must visually estimate ≤15mm ( include dissection ) angiography . Expected ability deliver stent lesion ( absence excessive tortuosity calcification ) . Expected ability fully expand stent . Clinical Exclusion Criteria Subject know hypersensitivity contraindication cobalt chromium standard intraprocedure anticoagulant ( ) ; subject sensitivity contrast adequately pretreated medication . Subject know allergy contraindication clopidogrel ( Plavix ) aspirin . Subject know bleeding disorder hypercoagulable disorder , refuse blood transfusion . Subject suffer gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed within 30 day index procedure would interfere antiplatelet therapy . Subject renal insufficiency define serum Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl . Subject immunosuppressive disorder , access site infection , acute systemic infection due cause . Subject medical illness ( e.g. , cancer , endstage congestive heart failure ) may cause subject noncompliant protocol requirement , confound data interpretation , associate life expectancy less three year . Subject medical illness would make unlikely respond treatment ( e.g. , sickle cell nephropathy/sickle cell disease , scleroderma , arteriolar nephrosclerosis , hemolyticuremic syndrome vasculitis ) . Subject Qwave MI within 30 day index procedure . Subject stroke TIA within 30 day index procedure . Subject history congestive heart failure previously document LVEF ≤25 % . Subject normotensive adequate control hypertension ( SBP &lt; 140 mmHg DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg ) utilize diet control and/or medication regimen involve one antihypertensive medication . Subject acute thrombophlebitis deep vein thrombosis . Subject actively participate another drug device trial complete require protocol followup period . Subject may enrol study ( Protocol # 05102 ) may participate clinical trial followup period . Subject unable understand cooperate study procedure provide inform consent . Subject unable return followup visit ( distance , etc ) . Subject pregnant . Subject undergone vascular surgery ( CABG , AAA repair , AF bypass ) fully recover effect surgery ( &lt; 3 month ) . Subject plan staged treatment bilateral renal artery stenosis . Subject prior surgical intervention target artery , undergone previous stent placement target lesion . Target lesion locate transplant kidney . Kidney treat &lt; 8 cm determine duplex ultrasound report , CTA report , MRA report within 180 day procedure . If kidney size document one method , e.g . CTA ultrasound , one method duplex ultrasound , kidney size document duplex ultrasound shall use determine study eligibility . Subject plan additional ancillary procedure ( ) renal stenting procedure . Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Subject lesion segment , include dissection , &gt; 15 mm length . Requirement &gt; 1 stent treat full length lesion dissection . Target lesion total ( 100 % ) occlusion . Evidence thrombus mobile fill defect target lesion vessel . Subject coexist aneurysmal occlusive disease abdominal aorta require surgical reconstruction followup period . Target lesion nonatherosclerotic ( fibromuscular dysplasia ) . Subject artery patent bifurcation within 10 mm ostium might cover placement stent . The target lesion within artery solitary functioning kidney , subject contralateral totally occluded renal artery . For planned treatment bilateral lesion : critical lesion , i.e . lesion great stenosis ( treat first ) , either treat unsuccessfully require bailout procedure . ( NOTE : Less critical lesion exclude point . ) Subject condition precludes proper angiographic assessment make percutaneous arterial access unsafe . The target lesion densely calcified yield balloon dilation . Subject recent change renal function unrelated catheter surgical procedure clinical stigma atheroemboli syndrome ( i.e. , livedo reticularis : nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia ; digital gangrene ; progressive renal insufficiency without identifiable etiology ) . Subject accessory renal artery &gt; 50 % stenosis . Accessory renal artery may stented part study .</criteria>
