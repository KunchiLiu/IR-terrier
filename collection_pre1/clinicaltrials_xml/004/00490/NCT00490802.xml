	<brief_title>Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism developmental disorder characterize abnormality speech communication , impaired social functioning , repetitive behavior restrict interest . A number researcher suggest neuropeptide oxytocin may implicate etiology autism . Given likely possibility dysregulated oxytocin autism , goal pilot study investigate long-term therapeutic effect oxytocin treatment autism . One practical issue oxytocin exist pill form . Only intravenous form available United States form may may pass blood-brain barrier . In addition , intravenous oxytocin practical treatment study . One alternative intranasal oxytocin ; form administration know pass blood-brain barrier , easy participant self-administer . Although available United States , process receive Investigational New Drug exemption use import Europe . Thus , pilot investigation explore daily intranasal oxytocin treatment autism . Also , , , outcome measure assess social function `` real world '' context clinical trial ; yet , major target intervention , especially autism . Thus , final goal study explore use Event Contingent Recording index change social functioning affect . Event Contingent Recording methodology develop personality/social psychologist , allow participant report symptom , affect , behavior close time experience . In addition , enable sensitive assessment , methodology allows assessment diverse ( e.g. , home versus work ) detail measurement mood behavior . Finally , portion study aim perform gene expression profile use fresh whole blood explore molecular mechanism underlie oxytocin therapy oxytocin efficacy adult high function autism Asperger 's syndrome . The systemic effect oxytocin therapy molecular basis positive treatment response oxytocin well understood . An understanding former may help predict person may suffer side-effects treatment latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers could predict treatment response .</detailed_description>
