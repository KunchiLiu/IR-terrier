	<brief_summary>This randomise , open label multi-centre phase III study compare activity lapatinib alone versus trastuzumab alone versus trastuzumab follow lapatinib versus lapatinib concomitantly trastuzumab adjuvant treatment patient ErbB2 overexpressing and/or amplify breast cancer . Patients enrol accord one two design schema , Design 2 two chemotherapy option ( Design 2 2B ) , randomise one four treatment regimen within design schema . The primary objective study compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient HER2 overexpressing and/or amplify breast cancer randomise trastuzumab one year versus lapatinib one year versus trastuzumab ( 12 18 week , accord assign design ) follow six-week treatment-free interval follow lapatinib ( 28 34 week , accord assign design ) versus trastuzumab combination lapatinib one year ( 52 week ) . Secondary objective include treatment comparison respect overall survival , time recurrence , time distant recurrence , safety tolerability , incidence brain metastasis , analysis conduct separately cohorts patient define presence absence cMyc oncogene amplification , expression level PTEN presence absence p95HER2 receptor . On August 18 , 2011 , ALTTO Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) meet review first plan interim analysis . The IDMC report comparison lapatinib alone versus trastuzumab alone cross futility boundary , indicate lapatinib alone arm unlikely meet pre-specified criterion demonstrate non-inferiority trastuzumab alone respect disease-free survival ( DFS ) . The IDMC also state three arm ( trastuzumab alone , sequential trastuzumab/lapatinib arm combination arm ) continue plan change .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 1 ; Nonmetastatic operable primary invasive adenocarcinoma breast fulfil follow : 1 . Histologically confirm 2 . Adequately excised ( exception : patient 'nonresectable ' deep margin invasion eligible provide receive radiotherapy encompass region concern ; patient histologically document infiltration skin ( pT4 ) eligible provide undergone receive radiotherapy encompass tumour bed ) ; 3 . Axilla dissect ; sentinel node sample allow provided axillary dissection follow confirmation positive sentinel node ; sentinel node sample alone NOT acceptable neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy lymph node status consider unknown , regardless result postchemotherapy axillary dissection ) ; 4 . Axillary node positive patient OR node negative patient tumour great equal 1.0 cm great diameter . For clarification , isolate tumour cell ( ITC ) consider pN0 micrometastases consider pN1 Known hormone receptor status ( ER/PgR ER alone ) For Designs 1 2 : Patients must receive least four cycle approve anthracyclinebased ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy regimen list exception Table 5 protocol . For Design 1 : Randomization must perform longer 12 week day 1 last chemotherapy cycle obtain postchemotherapy LVEF ≥ 50 . Study treatment must start 14 day randomization For Design 2 : Randomization must perform longer 6 week day 1 last anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy cycle obtain postanthracycline chemotherapy LVEF ≥ 50 . Study treatment must start 14 day randomization must concurrent taxanes . For Design 2B : Randomisation must perform longer 8 week definitive surgery . Nonanthracycline platinum contain regimen ( docetaxel carboplatin ) study treatment must start concomitantly 14 day randomisation . Baseline LVEF ≥50 % measure echocardiography MUGA scan . For Design 1 Design 2 completion anthracyclinebased ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy prior target therapy ( y ) ; Design 2B prior target therapy ( y ) chemotherapy ( docetaxel carboplatin ) Over expression and/or amplification HER2 invasive component primary tumour ( case neoadjuvant treatment , tissue sample use HER2 test collect neoadjuvant treatment start ) , accord one follow definition [ Wolff et al 2007 ] confirm central laboratory prior randomization : 3+ expression IHC ( &gt; 30 % invasive tumour cell ) ; 2+ 3+ ( 30 % le neoplastic cell ) expression IHC AND situ hybridization ( FISH/CISH ) test demonstrate HER2 gene amplification ; HER2 gene amplification FISH/CISH ( &gt; 6 HER2 gene copy per nucleus , FISH ratio [ HER2 gene copy chromosome 17 signal ] &gt; 2.2 . ) Patients negative equivocal overall result ( FISH test ratio ≤ 2.2 , ≤ 6.0 HER2 gene copy per nucleus ) staining score 0 , 1+ , 2+ 3+ ( 30 % le neoplastic cell ) IHC eligible participation trial . Equivocal local result may submit final determination central laboratory . Completion necessary baseline laboratory radiological investigation Signed write informed consent ( approved Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) obtain prior study specific screen procedure ) . History prior ( ipsi and/or contralateral ) invasive breast carcinoma ; Past ( less 10 year ) current history malignant neoplasm , except curatively treated 1 ) basal squamous cell carcinoma skin 2 ) carcinoma situ cervix . NOTE : Patients prior malignancy diagnose great 10 year past curatively treat surgery ONLY , WITHOUT radiation therapy systemic therapy ( chemotherapy endocrine ) eligible study . Patients prior diagnosis breast cancer melanoma , time , exclude study . Any clinically stag T4 tumour , include inflammatory breast cancer ; Bilateral tumours ; This exclusion criterion remove protocol amendment 1 . NOTE : multifocal/multicentric tumour permit : If patient nodenegative : one lesion must equal great 1.0 cm ( sum lesion diameter acceptable ) AND must positive HER2 status centrallyconfirmed ; If patient nodepositive : lesion size matter BUT one lesion must HER2 positivity centrallyconfirmed . If several lesion find HER2 positive locally , large lesion consider central review .
