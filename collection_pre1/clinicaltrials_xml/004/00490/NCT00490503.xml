	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Techniques ( MRS ) Assessing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , MRI use determine effect pre-surgical chemotherapy breast cancer . MRS look chemical component tissue . MRS may helpful understand pre-surgical chemotherapy work . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , 3 MRI MRS scan breast include affect breast . The scan perform chemotherapy , 21 day ( plus minus 3 day ) start chemotherapy ( Day 1 = first day chemotherapy ) , end chemotherapy/before surgery . If never MRI scan , give opportunity watch 10-minute video prepare procedure . You specialize MRI scan : MRS , DCE , DW . The DCE Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI . DCE-MRI used create 3-D image breast tumor , small blood vessel see . The Diffusion-Weighted ( DW ) MRI may possibly use study structure tumor cell base movement water molecule tumor tissue . For , lie still stomach breast position within opening detector . A contrast drug , help MRI scanner show breast lesion , inject needle vein . The procedure take 1 hour . The tissue remove surgery collect part study . Small piece tissue stain special stain give information tumor ( invasiveness , blood vessel supply , number positive lymph node , tissue change ) . Multiple section tissue stain make sure tissue area interest able compare MRI/MRS image . The tissue photograph x-rayed . You consider off-study 6 month surgery . If unable surgery , consider off-study 6 month last MRI MRS . This investigational study . The MRI MRS scan FDA approve commercially available . The first third scan part routine patient care . The second scan part routine care . Up 28 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl SGPT &lt; 1.5 X normal . 10 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . The acceptable consent form one attached end protocol . 1 . Patients receive previous chemotherapy newly diagnose breast cancer . 2 . Patients evidence primary breast lesion ( e.g. , T0 , Tx ) . 3 . Patients unwilling come back regular assessment response . 4 . Patients claustrophobia obesity ( exceed equipment weight limit ) . 5 . Pregnant woman , lactate woman sexually active woman childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception . 6 . Patients myocardial infarction within 6 month study entry ; unstable angina pectoris ; uncontrolled congestive heart failure ; uncontrolled arrhythmia . 7 . Patients pacemaker metallic insert compatible 3T MR scanner . 8 . Patients bilateral breast disease , recurrent newly diagnose breast cancer .</criteria>
