	<brief_summary>The purpose exploratory study assess efficacy safety nesiritide participant acute ( quick severe form illness early stage ) heart failure ( heart inadequately pumps blood body ) include acute exacerbation chronic ( last long time ) heart failure , administer intravenous ( vein ) bolus ( large amount ) follow intravenous infusion ( fluid medicine deliver vein way needle ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study Nesiritide Participants With Acute Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( medical research study participant researcher tell treatment participant receive , `` unblinded '' ) , multi-center ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , stepwise , bolus plus intravenous infusion , fixed-flexible ( arbitrary dose titration [ slow increase drug dosage , guide participant 's response ] ) study . The study consist 3 period : Observation period ( time obtain consent start study treatment ) , Treatment period , Follow-up period ( 24 hour initiation study treatment [ discontinuation ] 30 day initiation study treatment ) . The participant randomly assign 1 follow 3 treatment group : 2+0.005 group , 1+0.01 group 2+0.01 group . The treatment period consist treatment bolus injection ( 1 minute ) follow intravenous infusion ( 24 hour : Period 1 [ fixed-dose period ] 3 hour Period 2 [ flexible-dose period ] 21 hour ) .The study conduct stepwise hence , initially participant randomly assign 1 follow 2 group : 1+0.01 group 2+0.005 group . Participants receive nesiritide initial dose 0.005 0.01 microgram per kilogram per minute ( mcg/kg/min ) , dose escalation 0.005 mcg/kg/min per dose conduct every 3 hour maximum 0.03 mcg/kg/min Period 2 . Safety data least 5 participant assess group , confirm safety 2 group , participant assign third group nesiritide 2 microgram per kilogram ( mcg/kg ) +0.01 mcg/kg/min . Then participants follow maximum 30 day initiation study treatment , follow-up period . Participants primarily evaluate effect nesiritide hemodynamic parameter pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) , unmeasurable complement pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure ( PADP ) . Participants ' safety also monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
