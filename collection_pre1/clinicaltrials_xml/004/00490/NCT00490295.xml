	<brief_summary>Brain injury occur one-quarter one-half congenital heart defect infant perioperative period . A blood test use biomarker diagnose brain injury would important . Postoperative cerebral ischemia may decrease inotropic support , ventilation , medical management aim increase oxygen delivery brain . Currently FDA approve blood test assess brain ischemia infant undergo cardiac surgery . Specific Aim 1 : We prospectively study 10 neonate ( &lt; 30 day age ) undergo cardiac surgery utilize cardiopulmonary bypass arterial switch operation Norwood operation determine specificity sensitivity blood test brain injury . This aim accomplish analyze blood sample S-100 NSE drawn prior surgery , day follow cardiac surgery long patient remain intensive care unit ( maximum 5 day ) time postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging . The S-100B NSE value correlate brain magnetic resonance image study cardiac surgery follow cardiac surgery . Hypothesis : We expect concentration S-100B NSE significantly high blood neonate congenital heart disease document brain injury brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Furthermore , predict blood level S-100B NSE may correlate clinical outcome ( time extubation , hospital discharge , neurodevelopmental outcome 6 month age ) . Specific Aim 2 : We prospectively study neonate 6 month follow cardiac surgery determine correlation neurodevelopment concentration S-100B NSE . To achieve specific aim , blood sample S-100B NSE neurodevelopmental test do 6 month follow cardiac surgery . Hypothesis : We expect neonate elevate S-100B NSE abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging document specific aim 1 significant decline neurodevelopment 6 month cardiac surgery . Long-term : The long-term goal research diagnose brain ischemia infant use biomarker blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Ten full-term neonate ( &gt; 36 week gestation ) , 1-30 day age , present arterial switch operation Norwood operation 2 ml blood drawn prior cardiac surgery , 2 ml blood drawn day cardiac surgery long patient remain intensive care unit indwell line ( maximum 5 day ) 2 ml blood drawn day followup brain magnetic resonance imaging study ( within maximum 5 day ) determine blood concentration S100B NSE . 2 . Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) include T1 , 2 , DWI , spectroscopy , magnetic resonance angiography , perform prior cardiac surgery follow cardiac surgery study patient . Timing follow-up brain magnetic resonance image include T1 , 2 , DWI , spectroscopy , magnetic resonance angiography , base stability patient assess attend physician . Optimal timing brain magnetic resonance image 4 day postop . 3 . Maternal information include level education , medication , medical history obtain . Two ml blood also obtain mother determine maternal blood concentration S100B NSE . 4 . Study patient clinical variable , include vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate ) , systemic oxygen saturation extremity pulse oximetry , near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , routine laboratory value obtain time study blood sample . 5 . Operative variable include cardiopulmonary bypass time , aortic cross clamp time , circulatory arrest time , hematocrit bypass obtain . Transfusion quantity pack red blood cell , fresh frozen plasma , platelet , cryoprecipitate use operating room cardiac intensive care unit also obtain 6 . Outcome variable include length mechanical ventilation , hospital stay , gross neurological abnormality ( clinical seizure ) obtain . Follow-up : 7 . All patient neurodevelopmental test 6 month heart surgery . 8 . Another 2 ml blood S100B NSE obtain patient return 6 month neurodevelopmental testing .</detailed_description>
