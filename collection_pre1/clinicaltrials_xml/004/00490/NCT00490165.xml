	<brief_summary>This retrospective chart review patient record University Mississippi Medical Center . We actively recruit patient study . Recent animal study conduct show periapical abscess pregnancy cause systemic inflammatory response mother . Also due increase TNF-alpha ( inflammatory cytokine ) mother also become insulin resistant thus developed gestational diabetes . Periodontal inflammation show research lead low-birth weight pre-term birth . We look retrospectively see association exists chart data periapical periodontal inflammation adverse pregnancy outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims 1 . To determine possible association periapical oral infection adverse pregnancy outcome female patient School Dentistry , Dental/Dental Emergent Care Clinic ( Jackson Medical Mall ) , UMC Hospital . 2 . To examine effect several confound variable related stress pain periapical infection adverse outcome . B . Background Significance During past five year increase evidence association periodontal infection adverse pregnancy outcome human , include preterm birth , low birth-weight baby , gestational diabetes , miscarriage , preeclampsia . These event likely result oral infection bacteremia release pro-inflammatory cytokine diseased oral site describe . Proinflammatory cytokine report harmful destructive successful pregnancy . The adverse fetal inflammatory response TNF-alpha , IL-6 C-reactive protein associate preterm birth . These cytokine also commonly associate oral infection , periodontal periapical11 . In addition , oral infection often produce pain stress , consider harmful successful pregnancy . Since effect periodontal infection adverse pregnancy outcomes describe , would worthwhile examine specific effect oral periapical abscess adverse birth outcome , begin determine whether association type oral infection adverse outcomes . There publish information concern possible association tooth abscess pregnancy outcomes . In addition , know biological mechanism direct link periodontal infection , pre-term birth low birth-weight baby . Secondary factor age , race , life-style likely confound assessment association . There preliminary study variables regard association periodontal infection adverse pregnancy outcome , periapical lesion . Since periapical lesion produce pain , secondary factor could important pregnancy outcome primary factor ( bacteria proinflammatory cytokine ) . C. Data collection . Archived dental record female patient treat past three year University Mississippi School Dentistry Dental/Dental Emergent Care Clinic ( Jackson Medical Mall ) examine . Each patient record assign study number , data enter Excel spreadsheet use study number . Since pregnancy outcome part UMC Hospital record , principal investigator link dental hospital record use patient name . However , data collect use research number . Following procedure link patient record , patient name discard . Thus , possible link individual patient study data . The following information record : age , pregnancy status , number pulpal abscess , number site periodontitis ( pocket depth â‰¥ 4 mm ) , race , high level education , DMFT ( decay , miss , fill teeth ) , number child , past pregnancy outcome , diagnosis diabetes mellitus , know pregnancy relate condition experience previous pregnancy record Dental/Emergent Dental Care Clinic . We define adverse pregnancy outcomes gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , pre-term birth , low-birthweight infant UMC hospital record . D. Statistical Analysis data . The data analyze use SPSS v12 use appropriate statistical test , include factorial ANOVA post hoc test , multivariate logistic regression , Spearman correlation test , chi square analysis .</detailed_description>
