	<brief_summary>We propose combine lapatinib RT alone patient locally advanced head neck cancer tolerate chemotherapy . The main objective study determine efficacy combine concurrent radiation lapatinib term time-to-progression ( TTP ) group patient . In addition , determine 2-year locoregional control rate ( LRC ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient . We also evaluate profile frequency late toxicity , specifically mucosal dermatologic toxicity , combination lapatinib RT patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Radiation Stage III-IV Head Neck Cancer Patients Who Can Tolerate Concurrent Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There substantial data suggest EGFR Her-2/neu expression important predictor prognosis HNSCC . EGFR blockade monoclonal antibody conjunction radiotherapy show improve survival radiotherapy alone patient locally advanced HNSCC . Dual inhibition EGFR ErbB2 tyrosine kinase result great inhibitory effect downstream signal pathway cancer cell inhibition either receptor alone . Phase I study HNSCC suggest drug well tolerate deliver either alone concurrently cisplatin base chemoradiotherapy HNSCC . We propose combine lapatinib RT alone patient locally advance HNSCC tolerate chemotherapy . The main objective study determine efficacy combine concurrent radiation lapatinib term time-to-progression ( TTP ) group patient . In addition , determine 2-year locoregional control rate ( LRC ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient . We also evaluate profile frequency late toxicity , specifically mucosal dermatologic toxicity , combination lapatinib RT patient locally advanced HNSCC .</detailed_description>
