	<detailed_description>Recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) common health problem three lose affect 1-2 % two loss affect 5 % woman reproductive age ( Brenner 2003 ) . Several aetiology identify discussion play role RPL , include chromosomal translocation inversion , anatomic alteration uterus , endocrinological abnormality , autoimmune disorder infection , smoke alcohol consumption , exposure environmental factor well coagulation immunoregulatory defect ( Pandey 2005 , Lee 2000 ) . About 30-40 % case RPL remain unexplained standard gynaecological , hormonal karyotype analysis ( Rey 2000 ) . As stated Pandey et al ( Pandey 2005 ) , successful implantation pregnancy require balanced equilibrium coagulation , fibrinolysis vascular remodel process angiogenesis order avoid excess fibrin accumulation placental vessel intervillous space ( Buchholz 2003 ) . However , thrombosis decidual vessel report one major cause RPL ( Arias 1998 ) could explain excessive thrombosis placental vessel , placental infarction , secondary uteroplacental insufficiency . Recurrent pregnancy loss well-described complication antiphospholipid antibody syndrome thought associate thrombosis placental vessel , often evidence placental infarction . More recently , inherit thrombophilic abnormality link RPL obstetric complication . At least 16 case-control study find high prevalence factor V Leiden ( FVL ) woman unexplained RPL ( 30 % ) compare 1 % 10 % control subject odds ratio range 2 5 ( Press et al . 2002 ) . Likewise , thrombophilic risk factor include factor II G20210A , hyperhomocysteinemia , protein C , protein S antithrombin deficiency also associate RPL ( Sanson 1996 ; Brenner 1999 ) . A meta-analysis Rey et al . ( Rey 2003 ) include 31 case control , cohort cross-sectional study , show association thrombophilia fetal loss , though magnitude varies accord type fetal loss type thrombophilia . Although pregnancy loss occur first trimester , woman thrombophilia increase risk pregnancy loss second third trimester . A number study find FVL carrier significantly high risk late pregnancy loss early first trimester loss ( Sarig 2002 ; Meinardi 1999 ) . One possible explanation late pregnancy loss may reflect thrombosis placental vessel . However , majority pregnancy loss woman thrombophilia still occur first trimester ( Sarig 2002 ; Younis 2000 ) . The mechanism responsible association inherit thrombophilia RPL fully elucidate . Pathological study placentas obtain gestation terminate foetal loss reveal thrombotic change infarct . These observe maternal vessel 50-90 % placentae woman stillbirth ( Gris 1999 ; Many 2001 ) . However , change also find significant proportion woman RPL without thrombophilia ( Gris 1999 ; Martinelli 2000 ) . Raising possibility yet undetermined gestational prothrombotic risk factor either fetal vessel maternal vessel . A role foetoplacental thrombosis suggest study demonstrate association factor V genotype miscarry foetus placental infarction . However , finding thrombotic change maternal side efficacy LMWH , cross placenta , prevent foetal loss support latter . Emerging data therapy woman inherit thrombophilia pregnancy loss mostly uncontrolled include small series patient treat mainly LMWH . The potential advantage LMWH unfractionated heparin higher antithrombotic ratio , mean less bleeding well antithrombotic effect , long half-life potential need one injection per day , small injected volume less heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . These advantage particularly appeal prolong prophylaxis throughout pregnancy postpartum period . A recent collaborative study demonstrate safety use LMWH 486 gestation ( Sanson 1999 ) . Successful outcome report 83/93 ( 89 % ) gestation woman recurrent pregnancy loss 28 gestation woman preeclampsia previous pregnancy . Since novel inherit acquire prothrombotic abnormality currently investigation , clinician often address question prophylaxis woman RPL specific thrombophilic defect . The encouraging result present let rise clinical practise LMWH therapy without proved evidence woman without thrombophilic disorder . To give basis rational therapy question answer prospective randomize trial .</detailed_description>
