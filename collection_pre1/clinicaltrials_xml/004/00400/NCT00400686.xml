	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Treating Anemia Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine hematologic response transfusion requirement chemotherapy-related moderate anemia administration high initial dose epoetin alfa follow less frequent maintenance dose epoetin alfa multiple myeloma patient . Secondary - Determine effect moderate anemia quality life patient . - Correlate change hemoglobin level change quality life patient treated drug . - Determine effect drug transfusion requirement day 28 patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , pilot study . Patients receive high-dose epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) week 4 week hemoglobin level reach 12-13 g/dL . Patients receive epoetin alfa SC every 2 week 8 week OR week 4 week , every 2 week 8 week ( long hemoglobin level remain 12-13 g/dL ) . Patients receive maintenance epoetin alfa SC every 4 week 12 week . Patients whose hemoglobin level decrease 1-1.5 g/dL return previous epoetin alfa schedule . Patients whose hemoglobin level &lt; 9 g/dL return previous schedule may receive epoetin alfa additional 24 week . Quality life assess baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 week treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
