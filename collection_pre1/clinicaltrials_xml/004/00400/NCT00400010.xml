	<detailed_description>Background : A promising approach secondary prevention problem drinking provide brief intervention medical setting . However , brief intervention become implemented general practice ( GPs ) due insufficient role security therapeutic commitment physician . Computerized expert system provide cost-effective mean intervention effective field smoke cessation . However , alcohol field , research issue scarce . Objectives : Comparing expert system base Transtheoretical Model behavior change patient at-risk drinking , alcohol abuse alcohol dependence control condition . Methods : About 2,500 screening among consecutive general hospital patient age 18 64 conduct . Subjects fulfil inclusion criterion ( severe alcohol dependence exclude ) randomly assign one two condition 150 patient : ( 1 ) In TTM-based expert system group , patient receive individualized feedback drinking norm , health-related risk core construct TTM , augment TTM-based manual . ( 2 ) In control group , participant receive booklet health behavior . Outcome assessment conduct 12 month . Outcome variables alcohol consumption , stage change progress utilization formal help . Expected impact : Findings expect provide evidence computerize TTM base expert system use primary care . This would first international result confirm approach alcohol field . If TTM-based expert system would effective , could significantly save resource enhance secondary prevention . Therefore , data great public health interest . Relationship objective collaboration : As study , empirical data new proactive approach reach underserved population addiction field provide .
