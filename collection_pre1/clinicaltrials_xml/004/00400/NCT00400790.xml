	<detailed_description>Aims To investigate whether difference postoperative cognitive function , total morbidity cost , follow cardiac surgery determine use either propofol desflurane primary anaesthetic agent . Hypothesis The null hypothesis difference postoperative cognitive function , total morbidity economic cost base type primary anaesthetic deliver . Participants : Following human ethic committee approval , inform write consent , 180 patient undergoing elective cardiac surgery randomize receive desflurane propofol primary anaesthetic agent surgery . This conducted Royal Melbourne Hospital . Data collect preoperatively , intraoperatively throughout entire hospital stay , include three-month follow-up . Eligibility criterion Inclusion Criteria Adult male female patient age 18 year old , undergoing on-pump elective coronary artery bypass surgery general anaesthesia . 1 . Off-pump cardiac surgery 2 . Require surgery acute coronary syndrome 3 . Dialysis dependent renal dysfunction 4 . Severe liver dysfunction determine liver transaminase 1.5X great normal . 5 . Pre-existing diagnosis schizophrenia , dementia recent stroke cognitive disorder 6 . Recent alcohol/drug abuse/intoxication 7 . Re-do Coronary Artery Grafts 8 . Coronary Artery Grafts plus surgery Interventions Patients receive either propofol desflurane primary anaesthetic agent duration surgery . The follow minor difference group outline : 1 . For anaesthesia induction , desflurane group receive inhalational sevoflurane , desflurane pungent irritant airway make inhalational induction anaesthesia difficult . Following induction anaesthesia sevoflurane , anaesthetic change desflurane 0.5-2 MAC necessary ( include desflurane administration cardiopulmonary bypass via oxygen inlet circuit ) . 2 . Patients propofol group general anaesthesia induce maintain propofol ( effect site steer use Asena TCI pump level maintain 1.5-3Âµg/ml use Marsh pharmacokinetic profile ) . No volatile anaesthesic agent allow group include CPB . The following anaesthesia , surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass , sedation technique common group : 1 . Anaesthesia co-induction / sedation fentanyl ( 2-5 ug/kg ) midazolam ( 0.025- 0.05mg/kg ) . Following induction anaesthesia , patient maintain combined intravenous infusion fentanyl ( 1.5 ug/kg/hr ) midazolam ( 0.025-0.05 mg/kg/hr ) Fi02=1 . 2 . Anaesthesia monitoring : In addition specify routine anaesthetic monitoring per Australian New Zealand College Anaesthetists guideline general anaesthesia ( 38 ) , patient intra-arterial pressure monitoring , pulmonary artery ( PA ) pressure monitoring , nasopharyngeal temperature monitor transoesophageal echocardiography . These standard monitoring patient undergoing cardiac surgery Royal Melbourne Hospital . 3 . Hemodynamic management : metaraminol nitro-glycerin administer control systemic arterial blood pressure within systolic arterial pressure range 100-140 mmHg . Beta blockade use anaesthetist discretion either haemodynamic control , management ventricular arrhythmia . 4 . Cardiopulmonary bypass : venous reservoir cardiopulmonary bypass circuit prim 2L crystalloid solution ( Plasma-lyte ( R ) Baxter Healthcare ) maintain temperature 35 degree Celsius . Cardiopulmonary bypass perform standardized technique cannulation ascend aorta single two-staged right atrial-caval cannula non-assisted venous drainage . After initiation cardiopulmonary bypass patient 's nasopharyngeal temperature allow drift progressively 34 degree Celsius point maintain heat exchanger rewarming initiate . Patients ' haemoglobin maintain 70 g/l . The ascend aorta cross-clamped cardiac arrest induce administration tepid blood cardioplegia temperature range 20-25 degree Celsius . The ratio blood initial crystalloid cardioplegia require achieve arrest 4:1 order obtain potassium concentration induction cardioplegia least 20 mmol/l . Arrest achieve antegrade administration cardioplegia aortic root catheter , follow retrograde administration coronary sinus catheter . Left ventricular distension monitor transoesophageal echocardiography . Further dos maintenance cardioplegia give follow completion graft anastomosis . Rewarming patient commence begin last distal anastomosis ( 15 minute prior aortic cross clamp removal ) . The temperature heat exchanger use achieve exceed 37 degree Celsius . Atrial pace wire attached electrical activity establish 5 minute reperfusion pre-operative heart rate le 60 per minute patient B-adrenergic antagonist . The patient remain full cardiopulmonary bypass support period time approximately equal 20-25 % cross clamp time anaesthetist , perfusionist , surgeon satisfy cardiac function appropriate achieve separation . 5 . Post CPB hemodynamic management : Cardiac output measure thermodilution technique . Dobutamine administer low cardiac output ( cardiac index less 2.0 L/min/m2 ) noradrenaline use low SVR syndrome felt appropriate anaesthetist , surgeon , intensivist concern . 6 . Postoperative sedation : following skin closure , anaesthesia agent cease . A low dose propofol infusion permit postoperative ICU sedation suitable extubation.The aim Ramsay sedation score 2 upon initial return ICU haemodynamically stable , aim score 4 . Patients escort intensive care unit ventilate achieve accepted standard criterion extubation ( awake co-operative , warm , haemodynamically stable , PaCO2 &lt; 50mmHg , PaO2 &gt; 100 FiO2 = 0.4 ) . Patients allow awaken ICU extubated . 7 . Rescue protocol : In group additional rescue analgesia allow form fentanyl , morphine , paracetamol , tramadol , indomethacin necessary provide adequate analgesia . Endpoints Primary Endpoint - neurological protection 1 . Neurocognitive function test ( preoperative , prior hospital discharge , 3 month postoperation ) Secondary Endpoints 1 . Delirium assessed confusion assessment method ( CAM ) . 2 . In-hospital morbidity determine composite morbidity score Tertiary endpoint 1 . Cost post-operative care The following endpoint cumulative report entire hospital stay : Composite morbidity/mortality score This weighted morbidity score . It score 3 point death , 2 point major morbid outcome 1 point minor outcome . Major morbid outcome define outcome permanent ( e.g . stroke ) natural history could lead death , without actually cause death . It derive morbidity likely result inadequate tissue perfusion immunomodulation . Economics Hospital economics assess multiple criterion ; 1 . Time spend ICU 2 . Time spent hospital 3 . Cost blood product 4 . Re-operation 5 . Pathology investigation need hospital 6 . Cost drug administer Cost/economics estimation take Australian publish study index 2006 price . Investigation test base rebate Medical benefit schedule . Both list . The cost re-operation base theatre time four hour indexed 2006 price , include doctor fee . The number hospital day charge hospital length stay - ICU time . The actual cost operation `` fixed cost '' ( relate primary operation reoperations ) . The cost look , therefore potentially variable cost may impact upon possible use volatile anaesthesia , propofol . Obviously return OR would involve cost involve OR time , disposable include CPB circuit , drug ( include aprotinin recombinant factor VIIa ) . Sample size Estimates power minimal group size obtain perform forward look power analysis base upon ability show significant difference neurocognitive testing . This base previous study show 38 % incidence neurocognitive abnormality group consistent propofol arm , aim effect size reduction 50 % .
