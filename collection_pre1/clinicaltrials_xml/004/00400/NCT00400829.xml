	<brief_title>E7389 Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor activity E7389 ( eribulin mesylate ) , term objective response rate , patient recurrent progressive stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . II . Evaluate time progression overall survival patient treated drug . III . Evaluate toxicity profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV 1-2 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly least 6 month periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
