	<detailed_description>Joint Protection ( JP ) important intervention management people arthritis . Altering work method ( e.g . use proximal joint , dynamic activity ) , energy conservation ( balance activity rest ) use assistive device place less strain joint structure weaken disease process . These strategy ought decrease pain stress joint , improve function , facilitate maintain social role . The effectiveness JP evaluate number study , group set . JP beneficial short-term effect pain function patient establish RA moderate functional problem . Using assistive device reduces pain task performance comparison normal method alter work method significantly reduce difficulty activity daily live ( ADL ) . However generally result significant behavioral change long-term impact reduce pain maintain function may reach JP taught use behavioral education method . Additionally , adherence RA patient different intervention generally modest , may well determine effectiveness give intervention , especially long-term . All previous study carry group setting , however , Switzerland , standard JP education provide one-to-one basis individualize education assume promising approach . This clinical trial aim test hypothesis individualize , resource-oriented JP education RA patient lead good therapy success short long-term , compare problem-oriented standard JP education term joint protection behavior . Secondary outcome parameter self-perception , general specific self-efficacy general health-related quality life .</detailed_description>
