	<brief_summary>This first large cohort study define epidemiology identify modifiable risk factor long-term CI functional deficit ICU survivor . We measure independent contribution risk factor delirium exposure sedative analgesic medication incidence long-term CI , control establish risk factor ( e.g. , age , pre-existing CI , apoE genotype ) . Defining contribution risk factor make possible develop preventive and/or treatment strategy reduce incidence , severity and/or duration long-term CI improve functional recovery patient acute critical illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIND-ICU Study : Delirium Dementia Veterans Surviving ICU Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances critical care lead improved survival among admitted intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . However , survival low among develop ICU delirium , quality life among survivor may affect post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment ( CI ) last month year . Long-term CI study predominantly follow cardiopulmonary bypass . In much large group medical general surgical ICU patient , extent problem relationship health-related quality life poorly characterize . Evidence 6 pilot cohort ( include ) total ~300 patient suggest astonish 30 % 80 % ICU survivor experience long-term CI functionally equivalent mild/moderate dementia although may progressive ( thus refer long-term CI ) . Interestingly , cognitive impairment arises independent severity illness , old patient appear particularly prone . Our work work others show delirium major independent risk factor impair cognitive function hospital discharge increase mortality 6 month . While clear whether delirium injurious brain simply marker brain injury , clear onset delirium ICU consider innocuous ; rather , may determinant long-term CI health-related quality life . Having spend last 8 year study delirium drug exposure acute phase critical illness long-term CI hospitalization , investigator thoroughly prepared continue next phase investigation VA ( Department Veterans Affairs ) patient , many older disproportionately risk adverse outcome follow ICU care .</detailed_description>
