	<brief_title>Transfusion-Associated Microchimerism Individuals Receiving Blood Transfusion After Traumatic Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 % individual suffer traumatic injury require blood transfusion ; , 10 % 15 % experience condition know transfusion-associated microchimerism . This occur white blood cell , leukocyte , donor 's blood persist recipient long transfusion occur . The genetically distinct donor cell remain individual decade , may account many 4 % white blood cell recipient 's body . This suggest donor cell tolerate recipient 's immune system . The purpose study examine specific factor predispose blood transfusion recipient develop microchimerism . In study , blood sample collect injured individual arrive University California Davis Medical Center . Individuals receive blood transfusion , well control group individual receive transfusion , approach enroll study . Individuals agree participate blood collect Days 7 , 14 , 28 Months 3 6 . Study researcher analyze blood evidence microchimerism . Participants microchimerism undergo additional blood collection Months 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 . Information collect participant health status , injury characteristic , hospital care , blood transfusion detail , blood donor characteristic .</detailed_description>
