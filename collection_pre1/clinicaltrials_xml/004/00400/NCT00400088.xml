	<brief_summary>This study do look well people respond two different drug treatment depression . Clinically , people depression respond differently drug treatment reason always clear . Some recent research suggest people depression family history bipolar disorder complete suicide , may react differently standard antidepressant medication without family history . Our data show family history complete suicide , well know predictor family history bipolar disorder , may help identify pre-bipolar high risk group i.e . currently depression future date declare bipolar illness ( manic-depression ) virtue development manic episode also . Our research suggest treatment- emergent symptom response trial antidepressant , agitation may strong predictor future bipolarity inherently dangerous particularly ascribed antidepressant treatment . Finally , possible subgroup depressive illness may respond well safely lithium , mood stabiliser use know bipolar depression . The objective proposal investigate response acute lithium treatment subject meet diagnostic criterion major depression , potentially risk bipolar disorder , virtue family history bipolarity complete suicide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Bipolar disorder illness consist distinct episode `` pole '' major depression mania ( bipolar I ) major depression hypomania ( bipolar II ) . Both pole illness may fully present simultaneously refer `` Mixed episode '' . The `` pole '' Major depression , Mania Mixed mood currently define descriptive criterion psychiatric diagnostic manual , DSMIV . Estimates prevalence Bipolar disorder high 6 % population . ( 1 ) It severe potentially lethal illness different course treatment profile unipolar depression , commonly know simply `` major depression '' . In 50-60 % case however , initial presentation bipolar disorder one major depression , several episode depression may occur declaration bipolarity , virtue manic hypomanic episode ( pre-bipolar depression ) . ( 2,3 ) The mainstay treatment unipolar major depression antidepressant . In contrast , antidepressant monotherapy contraindicate Bipolar I depression must use cautiously Bipolar II illness ( 4 ) much concern `` unacceptable cost /benefit ratio ' risk antidepressant induction mania rapid cycling ( increase frequency episode consequence antidepressant ) . ( 5 ) . Hence treatment early depressive episode bipolar illness require recognition depression specific bipolar disorder appropriate choice medication . Unfortunately , effort clearly distinguish bipolar unipolar depression cross-sectionally mostly disappointing . Most evidence support value family history ( 6 ) variable predictive value specific phenomenological course descriptor hypersomnia , psychomotor retardation , early-onset psychotic sub type ( 7,8 ) . The dilemma two-fold : 1 . Identifying patient suffer major depression high risk bipolar disorder . 2 . Choosing appropriate pharmacological treatment . In choose pharmacological treatment `` high risk '' group , possibility cause harm antidepressant true diagnosis bipolar disorder , treat depression adequately use mood stabilizer truly unipolar illness . This dilemma apply large subgroup present depression . A recent study primary care set suggest many 21 % patient currently treat antidepressant presume depressive disorder may fact bipolar diathesis , thus represent large group may improperly treat ( 9 ) . The concern use antidepressant know bipolar depression focus antidepressant - induction mania , rapid cycling always present immediately . However , may subtle immediate antidepressant treatment effect make diagnostic distinction possible pressing . ( 5,10 ) Indeed , postulate undetected bipolar depression may explain apparent poor treatment response increase suicidality use antidepressant adolescent population , one might expect increase prevalence depression first episode bipolar disorder virtue earlier age onset compare unipolar illness . ( 11 ) Objectives : The objective proposal investigate response acute lithium treatment subject meet diagnostic criterion major depression , potentially risk bipolar disorder , virtue family history bipolarity complete suicide . Primary Hypothesis : Subjects depression consider risk bipolar disorder , show significant clinical response lithium . Secondary Hypothesis : 1 . Subjects depression consider risk bipolar disorder , show significant clinical response paroxetine . 2 . Treatment emergent mixed symptom , particular agitation , occur antidepressant treat group . Study Design : This 6 week double-blind randomize control pilot trial lithium versus paroxetine subject major depression either family history bipolar disorder complete suicide . 20 subject men woman age 18 recruit centre . Patients randomize receive either lithium paroxetine first study visit dose drug adjust find right one patient . Patients assessed weekly basis thereafter.Data pilot study help development large adequately power study compare lithium paroxetine treatment depression high risk group . Patients exclude study would include subject able give inform consent , pregnant breast-feeding woman , current diagnosis panic disorder , post traumatic stress disorder psychosis , history mania hypomania , active substance abuse dependence last 6 month , current depressive episode less 4 week great 12 month duration , current prior adequate trial lithium paroxetine , concurrent use antidepressant augment agent treatment depression , clinically significant medical illness , particular renal impairment .</detailed_description>
