	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) use treatment end-stage renal disease approximately 25 % patient require dialysis Canada . The common complication bacterial infection 'peritonitis ' . Peritonitis cause severe acute abdominal pain may lead failure peritoneal dialysis treatment , hospitalization death , particularly leave untreated . Amongst strategy use prevent peritonitis , patient instruct regular use prophylactic ointment around point catheter exit body . At present time center Canada routinely prescribe mupirocin ointment use exit site , however new ointment become available . One ointment Polysporin Triple . The aim study determine catheter relate infection significantly reduce routine application Polysporin Triple comparison mupirocin ointment . A multi-centre , randomize , double blind , control study propose . Participants randomize either mupirocin Polysporin Triple follow 18 month first catheter related infection , death catheter removal . The difference catheter related infection rate compare two group . We anticipate result study allow clinician prescribe ointment likely reduce infection . By reduce complication rate associate peritoneal dialysis , ultimately improve survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) use treatment end-stage renal disease approximately 25 % patient require dialysis Canada . The common PD related complication infective peritonitis , syndrome acute pain , cloudy peritoneal dialysate , infection . Although many case peritonitis treated outpatient , recurrent unresolving infection result fibrotic change peritoneal membrane , catheter removal patient death . Gram positive organism amongst common cause PD peritonitis ; however , recent trend show increase rate gram negative fungal infection . Strategies prevent peritonitis include use prophylactic topical mupirocin site PD catheter exit abdominal wall . Despite innovation peritonitis still diagnose , average , one patient every 24 patient follow month . The aim study determine incidence catheter relate infection ( exit site infection , tunnel infection peritonitis ) significantly reduce routine application Polysporin Triple comparison mupirocin ointment.A multi-centre randomized double blind , control study propose . Polysporin Triple compare current standard care . All patient currently treat , start onto , peritoneal dialysis eligible . Participants randomize one two treatment arm ( mupirocin ; Polysporin Triple ) stratify accord ) centre b ) vintage ( incident versus prevalent ) , c ) type PD ( chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis vs. automate PD ) . Patients follow 18 month first catheter related infection , death catheter removal due technique failure . Catheter related infection strictly define use current guideline categorize exit site infection , infective peritonitis tunnel infection .</detailed_description>
