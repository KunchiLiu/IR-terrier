	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ( HSPC ) use transplantation patient undergoing high dose therapy treatment range cancer . - HSPC collect bloodstream treatment medication cause HSPC move bone marrow bloodstream , process call mobilization - 5 60 % patient fail collect enough HSPC transplant , use current mobilization technique - study aim assess safety combine derivative vitamin A , ATRA G-CSF ( drug commonly use mobilize HSPC ) - ATRA never combine G-CSF mobilization HSPC therefore study need assess safety combination , whether successfully mobilize HSPC</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ATRA Plus G-CSF Mobilization Hematopoietic Stem Progenitor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HSPC mobilization normally achieve use cytokine G-CSF , occasionally GM-CSF , often combination myelosuppressive chemotherapy . Studies mouse model show retinoids ( vitamin A derivative ) combine G-CSF , combination synergizes enhance HSPC mobilization see G-CSF alone . This trial aim assess safety mobilization efficacy combine mobilize dos G-CSF standard dose ATRA , use treatment regimen derive earlier murine study . In phase I pilot study , six patient multiple myeloma cutaneous lymphoma treat ATRA plus G-CSF , safety toxicity data collect two week study drug period plus two week ' follow-up . The primary endpoint safety toxicity , secondary endpoint observation mobilization efficacy demonstrate CD34+ cell count study period . Patients undergo stem cell collection study , purely observational study . Participating patient would normally schedule stem cell collection transplantation near future , rather patient stable disease candidate imminent transplantation , collect adequate HSPC previous mobilization attempt currently observe . Cutaneous lymphoma multiple myeloma choose suitable disease state study vitro evidence possible disease benefit retinoids disorder . If disease response note study follow period , ongoing ATRA offer discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
