	<brief_summary>This open-label , international , two-arm , parallel , randomized , Phase 3 study evaluate efficacy safety S-1/cisplatin versus 5-FU/cisplatin patient advance gastric cancer previously untreated chemotherapy advanced disease . Patients randomly assign ( 1:1 ) S-1/cisplatin ( experimental arm ) 5-FU/cisplatin ( control arm ) . Patients stratify number metastatic site ( one vs. one ) , locally advanced metastatic disease , prior adjuvant therapy ( yes ) , measurable non-measurable disease , center .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A patient must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : Has give write informed consent Has histologically confirm , unresectable , locally advanced ( Stage IV ) metastatic gastric cancer , include adenocarcinoma gastroesophageal junction Has measurable evaluable nonmeasurable disease , define follow : Measurable Disease Patients measurable disease define RECIST criterion , i.e. , presence least one measurable lesion . A measurable lesion one accurately measure least one dimension long diameter &gt; _ 20 mm use conventional technique &gt; _ 10 mm use spiral Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan . Locally recurrent disease ( primary ) accept least one measurable lesion ( i.e . peritoneal mass , lymph node , etc . ) Evaluable Nonmeasurable Disease Patients lesions limit define measureable disease ( i.e. , long diameter &lt; 20 mm conventional technique &lt; 10 mm spiral CT ) exclude patient primary lesion and/or nonevaluable cancer bone metastasis , ascites , pleural pericardium effusion , lymphangitic carcinomatosis skin lung , previously irradiate lesion progression , peritoneal carcinomatosis &lt; 10 mm diameter conventional imaging technique .
