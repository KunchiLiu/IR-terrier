	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Efficacy Short Exposure Defocus Slow Progression Myopia Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent result animal model myopia suggest eye ability detect overall sign defocus image fall retina , myopic defocus impose fitting plus-lenses halt slow axial elongation eye . In animal model , STOP growth signal show particularly strong - brief period high myopic defocus able outweigh effect prolong period impose hyperopic defocus promote eye growth . These result therefore suggest novel strategy prevent progression myopia child - imposition high level myopia brief period time . This approach conceptually distinct under-correction , impose chronic mild myopic defocus .</detailed_description>
