	<brief_title>Secondary Primary Tumor Prevention With EGFR , OSI-774 , Cyclooxygenase-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study second primary tumor prevention early stage ( stage I/II ) patient diagnose squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . The study evaluate effect cell clinical response study medication : Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Erlotinib ( OSI-774 , Tarceva™ ) , Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) Inhibitor ( Celecoxib ) . The side effect medication assess , chemical cell evaluated medication administer may show drug work . This information help researcher determine whether additional study drug conduct determine drug help prevent pre-cancerous lesion become cancerous . SCCHN account 5 % cancer , incidence approximately 37,200 new case United States per year 11,000 death . The five-year survival rate patient SCCHN United States develop country still poor , approximately 40 % , comparable five-year survival rate 1970s despite advance detection , surgery , radiation , chemotherapy . Thus , preventative approach development invasive cancer second primary tumor ( SPTs ) highly desirable novel strategy reduce cancer incidence SCCHN tobacco-carcinogen related malignancy pursue .</detailed_description>
