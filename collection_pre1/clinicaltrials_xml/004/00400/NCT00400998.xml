	<criteria>The subject healthy . Healthy subject define individual free clinically significant illness disease determine medical history ( include family ) , physical examination , laboratory study , test . They history seasonal allergic rhinitis Exhibit moderate response 1500 grass pollen grain per cubic metre 2 hour Vienna Challenge Chamber screen within 12 month precede screen visit . A moderate response define total nasal symptom score least 6 . ( Total nasal symptom score sum obstruction , rhinorrhoea , itch sneeze , score scale 0 3 ) . They positive skin prick test ( wheal size equal 4mm ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They positive RadioAllergoSorbent Test ( RAST ) ( equal class 2 ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They demonstrate ability use intranasal spray There condition factor would make subject unlikely able stay chamber 5 hour . They capable give informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form They available complete study measurement Pregnant nursing female .

Alternatively may surgically sterilise ( refer section 6.4 ) remain abstinent 2 week exposure study drug . On examination subject find structural nasal abnormality nasal polyposis , history frequent nosebleed , recent nasal surgery recent ( within 3 week ) ongoing upper respiratory tract infection responsible physician 's opinion render subject unsuitable participation study The subject respiratory disease mild stable asthma control occasional use asneeded shortacting betaagonists associate normal lung function . The subject likely unable abstain salbutamol use 8 hour challenge The subject history drug allergy , opinion responsible physician , contraindicate participation .
