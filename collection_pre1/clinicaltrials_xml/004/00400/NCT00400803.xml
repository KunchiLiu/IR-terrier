	<brief_title>Carboplatin Gemcitabine With Bevacizumab Every 2 Weeks Stage IIIb/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Carboplatin gemcitabine one active combination therapy use first-line therapy NSCLC . The optimum schedule administration carboplatin gemcitabine currently unknown . The addition bevacizumab another comparable platinum combination show overall survival advantage significantly great response rate progression-free survival .</detailed_description>
