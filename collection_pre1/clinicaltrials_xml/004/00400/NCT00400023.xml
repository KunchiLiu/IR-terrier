	<criteria>A patient must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . Has histologically cytologically proven advanced solid tumor standard therapy exists . 2 . Has provide write informed consent . 3 . Is 18 year age old . 4 . Is able take medication orally . 5 . Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 ( Appendix A , Performance Status ) . 6 . Has adequate organ function define follow criterion : Has transaminase AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . If liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) may ≤ 5 time ULN . Has total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN . Has absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3 ( ie , ≥ 1.5 x 109/L International Units [ IU ] ) . Has platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( IU : ≥ 100 x 109/L ) . Has hemoglobin value ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Has calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min ( CockcroftGault formula.76 See Appendix E ) . 7 . Is willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Exclude patient study he/she fulfill inclusion criterion , follow condition observe : 1 . Has treatment follow within specified time frame prior study drug administration : An investigational agent receive either concurrently within last 30 day . Previous therapy malignancy within 21 day , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic hormonal therapy ( 6 week nitrosureas mitomycin C ) . Previous radiotherapy within 14 day . Current enrollment another clinical study investigational agent . Patients participate survey observational study eligible participate study . 2 . Has serious illness medical condition ( ) include , limited , follow : Myocardial infarction within last 6 month , severe/unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV , see Appendix F ) . Known ( time entry ) gastrointestinal disorder , include malabsorption , chronic nausea , vomit , diarrhea present extent might interfere oral intake absorption study medication . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Known brain metastasis . Known leptomeningeal metastasis . Manifest ascites . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . 3 . Is receive concomitant treatment drug interact S1 FT . The following drug prohibit may interaction S1 FT : Sorivudine , uracil , dipyridamole , cimetidine folinic acid ( may enhance S1 FT activity ) . Allopurinol ( may diminish S1 FT activity ) . Phenytoin ( S1 FT may enhance phenytoin activity ) . Flucytosine , fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent ( may enhance S1 FT , flucytosine activity ) . Pilocarpine ( may inhibit CYP2A6 activity ) . 4 . Has sensitivity 5FU . 5 . Is pregnant lactate female . 6 . Is patient reproductive potential refuse use adequate mean contraception ( include male patient ) . 3.3.3 Discontinuation Criteria Clearly document reason patient 's discontinuation patient 's source document CRF . Discontinue patient study follow occur : Patient withdraws consent . Patient toxicity , opinion Investigator , require patient 's discontinuation . Patient intercurrent illness opinion Investigator require patient 's discontinuation . The Investigator conclude patient 's best interest discontinue therapy . Patient willingly inadvertently noncompliant opinion Investigator require patient discontinue . During optional Extension Phase , patient objective PD ( define image study clinical evaluation ) . g. During optional Extension Phase , patient require recovery period &gt; 4 week ( ie , 3 week schedule start date next cycle ; see Section 4.5.4.1.1 ) . The patient complete CrossOver Pharmacokinetic Phase choose enter optional S1 Extension Phase .</criteria>
