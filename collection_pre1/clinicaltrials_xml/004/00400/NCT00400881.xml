	<brief_title>Comparison Between Two Methods Spontaneous Breathing Trial ( SBT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal proposal find best way rapidly safely discontinue mechanical ventilation patient recover respiratory failure . It common practice patient perform trial `` spontaneous '' breathing still connect ventilator order ass readiness breathe without assistance . To help assessment , new mechanical mode incorporated modern ventilator . A recently develop mode , call Automatic Tube Compensation , design purpose ( `` spontaneous '' breathing ) . Whether method superior traditional one establish investigator intend address question . The investigator aim : 1. compare Automatic Tube Compensation vs. traditional mode ( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ) spontaneous breathe trial efficacy identify patient ready successfully removed mechanical ventilation 2. study physiologic variable well predict successful discontinuation mechanical ventilation two mode . The investigator plan prospectively randomize patient mechanical ventilation point wean evaluation , undergo spontaneous breathing trial current ventilatory mode ( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ) new mode ( Automatic Tube Compensation ) . Based predefined physiologic clinical variable , clinician decide whether patient ready remove mechanical ventilation . The proportion successful discontinuation ( need reinstitute mechanical ventilation ) duration wean period group compare . During spontaneous breathe trial , respiratory variable measure compare patient successful vs. non successful discontinuation order evaluate predictive value successful outcome . Mechanical ventilation use increasingly give grow population advance age multiple co morbidity rise volume aggressive medical procedure . It well known associate medical complication high health care cost . Reducing duration unnecessary mechanical ventilation minimize risk premature removal need assistance final objective project . Approaching goal decrease adverse effect treatment cost critical care .</detailed_description>
