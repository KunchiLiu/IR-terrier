	<brief_summary>To determine safe effective dos two biologic drug , erlotinib bevacizumab use chemotherapy radiation therapy advance head neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Biologics Chemoradiation Therapy Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced non-operative , Stage IV head neck cancer best guard prognosis . Improvements outcome achieve via combination chemotherapy radiotherapy . Concurrent chemoradiotherapy need optimize result , although recent data suggest benefit induction therapy well . Nonetheless , despite high remission rate , patient suffer local-regional and/or distant recurrence disease . The propose study build upon framework chemoradiotherapy ( induction plus concurrent ) via addition double biologic therapy . Specifically , combination bevacizumab erlotinib use , studied type cancer .</detailed_description>
