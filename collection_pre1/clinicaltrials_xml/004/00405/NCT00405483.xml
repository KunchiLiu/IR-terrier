	<detailed_description>Hip replacement effective option treat chronic hip condition cause pain functional impairment ( 1 ) . Significant improvement quality life , measure disease specific generic quality life measure , well document ( 2-4 ) . Hip replacement implant 'ball cup ' design , consist two articulate component : femoral head replacement consist ball attached stem insert proximal femur , acetabular component , make different material insert liner metal insert pelvis . These component attach patient 's bone use either polymethylmethacrylate - polymer commonly refer bone cement - roughen surface implant allow bone ingrowth . Hip replacements therefore broadly classified fixation technique use : cement , uncemented , hybrid , consist cement femoral component uncemented acetabular component . The uncemented design commonly use young patient quality bone good patient , implant demonstrate long term survival , cement step longer necessary achieve long term fixation . The 10 year survival current uncemented total hip design approach 95 % ( 5 ) . The majority 5 % revise do aseptic ( `` non-infected '' ) loosen component . The functional result revision total hip surgery poorer primary hip replacement surgery ( 3 , 5 , 6 ) . There approximately 20 000 hip replacement perform year Canada ( CIHI website ) ; result roughly 1000 revision next 10 year - great expense , term health care resource patient ' loss function . Obviously , effort direct decrease revision rate clinically financially worthwhile . Implant failure due aseptic loosening think arise patient related factor age , sex diagnosis , implant related factor design material use ( 5 ) . Efforts reduce aseptic loosening change implant design cement formulation occasionally result product perform well laboratory fail miserably real life , often implant large number patient ( 7-10 ) . This lead call careful control introduction new implant design use randomized trial precise radiographic assessment technique radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) look early sign loosen impending failure ( 7 , 9 , 11 ) . Minimally Invasive Surgery ( MIS ) new technology optimization healthcare service . It develop minimize damage surround tissue arthroplasty . reduce size incision . The possible benefit dramatic reduction length stay ( LOS ) total hip replacement ( THR ) patient ( 12 ) . However , MIS development lead modification exist instrumentation , prostheses technique may impact long-term survival implant ( 13 ) . There little research investigate effect change long-term patient outcome follow MIS surgery . The use RSA allow well understanding early fixation implant potential early failure due aseptic loosening .</detailed_description>
