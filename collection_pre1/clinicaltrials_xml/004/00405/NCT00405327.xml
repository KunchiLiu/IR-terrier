	<detailed_description>Localized solid tumor , sarcoma , neuroblastoma , Wilms ' tumor , generally effectively treat combination surgery , radiation chemotherapy . However , patient metastatic relapse disease poor prognosis . For past decade , effort increase overall survival progression-free survival patient high-risk pediatric young adult tumor , evaluate use high-dose chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . The proportion patient enter complete remission HSCT high , range 81 90 % . While autologous HSCT render large proportion patient temporarily disease-free , relapse develops majority patient . Survival appear improved strategy neuroblastoma , relapse occur majority patient . Similar strategy also try patient advanced stage sarcoma Wilms ' tumor , relapse even problematic . New approaches management difficult group patient need . There evidence suggest solid tumor may good candidate immunotherapy approach . In fact , recent experimental evidence indicate period lymphopenia occur HSCT may opportune time use treatment approach . In light poor prognosis young patient advance solid tumor , treatment approach warrant investigation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility To participate study , necessary collect sufficient tumor peripheral blood stem cell develop vaccine perform autologous stem cell transplant . Patients also previously tumor stem cell collect , available sufficient study , eligible participate study subject . 1 . Patients must histologically verified diagnosis neuroblastoma , Wilm 's tumor , sarcoma , include rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ES , PNET ) , synovial sarcoma , fibrosarcoma , desmoplastic round cell tumor . must meet one follow criterion : 1. metastatic disease diagnosis 2. never achieve complete remission follow frontline standard therapy 3. relapse receive standard therapy 2 . Patients must &lt; 30 year age time original diagnosis . 3 . Patients must source tumor tissue approximately 1 gram viable tumor obtain vaccine development . 4 . Patients must good performance status ( &gt; 70 % Lansky Karnofsky scale ) . 5 . Patients must life expectancy least 16 week . 6 . Females childbearing age ( &gt; = 12 year old ) must negative pregnancy test . Patients may enroll study various point treatment include diagnosis , recurrence , prior initiation study mandate transplant therapy . Because patient may enter study prior completion retransplant treatment , criterion must meet proceed high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant part study . These criterion requirement enter study order collect tumor peripheral blood stem cell . 7 . Patients must achieve complete response good partial response ( &gt; = 90 % decrease tumor volume ) proceeding transplant . For patient enrol study prior transplant VGPR CR must achieve eligible . 8 . Patients may undergo prior autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation , provide least 12 month elapse prior entry study . 9 . Patients must successful peripheral blood stem cell collection , cryopreservation PBSCs engraftment generation dendritic cell . 10 . Adequate baseline organ function must present : hematologic parameter ( applicable bone marrow involve tumor ) : 1 . ANC &gt; 500/mm3 2. platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 3. serum creatinine &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal age 4. serum hepatic transaminase ( AST , ALT ) &lt; 3x upper limit normal 5. serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal 6. cardiac echocardiogram either SF &gt; 27 % EF &gt; 50 % . A comparable EF MUGA scan also meet eligibility criterion . 11 . Give obtain informed consent 1 . Patients receive prior antitumor vaccine ineligible 2 . Patients meet response criterion progress prior study enrollment ineligible 3 . Patients know autoimmune disease condition ineligible 4 . Patients HIV infection , AIDS , hepatitis B surface antigen positivity , ongoing bleeding , significant uncontrolled medical psychiatric illness ineligible . 5 . Patients treatment infection must clear BMT physician prior enrollment . 6 . Patients pregnant nursing ineligible 7 . Prior allogenic transplant</criteria>
