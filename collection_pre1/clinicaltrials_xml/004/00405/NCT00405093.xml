	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The aim study assess effect Aprotinin ( antifibrinolytic drug use reduce bleed cardiac surgery ) renal function patient undergo surgery use hypothermic bypass circulatory arrest repair thoracic aorta . Secondary Objective : To compare effect Aprotinin Amicar major vascular outcome follow thoracic aorta surgery use hypothermic bypass circulatory arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aprotinin Use Renal Outcome Hypothermic Bypass Circulatory Arrest Surgical Repair Thoracic Aorta .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : Complex surgery ascend thoracic aorta aortic arch require use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) moderate profound total body hypothermia circulatory arrest . As expect , coagulation disorder common severe require multiple transfusion blood product , , turn , associate increase risk morbidity mortality . Over year , many technique employ ameliorate CPB- related bleeding agent aprotinin prove efficacious center controversy either high cost due safety concern . Aprotinin serine protease inhibitor , intend limit blood loss patient undergoing surgery , approve use 13 year ago , administer 250,000 surgery patient per year . Although mechanism action entirely know , show interfere contact activation , preserve platelet function , inhibit fibrinolysis , anti-inflammatory effect . Multiple study show superiority reduce blood loss antifibrinolytics study show safety concern regard early graft closure cause myocardial infarction ( follow coronary bypass surgery ) , renal failure , vascular thrombosis , death . Of note , several study address safety concerns- find risk aforementioned vascular complication comparable result utilize placebo antifibrinolytics aminocaproic acid . For example , associate renal dysfunction attribute competitive excretion process involve creatinine . That , aprotinin competes creatinine elimination kidney apparent renal dysfunction transient false marker renal injury . However , issue renal injury recently re-emerge serious problem multicenter study patient undergo coronary revascularization , whereby two fold increase postoperative renal dysfunction well nearly two fold rise postoperative stroke report . Much controversy many conflict result arise either inadequate information ( i.e. , definitive prospective study do ) , inadequately powered study intend outcome , inclusion multi-institution multi-surgeon outcome , study involve patient advanced ischemic heart disease whose ventricular function may compromise perioperatively . To overcome mentioned limitation , good characterize postoperative renal outcome , propose investigate safety aprotinin single institution , single surgeon , large homogenous surgical cohort underwent surgical repair ascend aortic arch use hypothermic CPB . Methods : This retrospective review data collect 1998 present ( nearly 900 patient ) adult patient ascend aorta aortic arch surgery NewYork Presbyterian Hospital . Data demographic , preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative clinical event extract patient 's electronic record record database ( Variables collect present Appendix 1 ) . A renal event comprise renal dysfunction ; define serum creatinine level least 2.0 mg/dL ( 177 µmol/L ) , accompanied increase least 0.70 mg/dL ( 62 µmol/L ) baseline renal failure ; define need renal replacement therapy . Creatinine value creatinine clearance recorded/calculated preoperatively postoperatively hospital discharge . Statistical Analysis Include analysis association potential preoperative , intraoperative , early postoperative variable postoperative renal dysfunction univariate analysis ( student 's test Fisher 's exact test ) . The variable identify univariate testing ( p &lt; 0.15 ) enter multivariate logistic regression . Significance set P &lt; 0.05 odds ratio calculate applicable .</detailed_description>
