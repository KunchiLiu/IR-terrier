	<detailed_description>The main objective proposal compare two successful treatment strategy significantly different economic implication head-to-head patient rheumatoid arthritis active disease despite methotrexate therapy . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory disease joint lead joint destruction , significant long-term morbidity mortality . Early treatment RA patient disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) significantly decrease complication . Methotrexate ( MTX ) excellent , economical first-line DMARD use treat majority RA patient . While patient respond well MTX , many continue active disease . Therefore , understand best treat RA patient active disease despite MTX therapy critically important . Although number therapy significantly different economic implication show effective add MTX , trial directly compare active therapy . This study compare therapeutic strategy use two regimen proven efficacy add MTX therapy ; ) hydroxychloroquine sulfasalazine ( cost ~ $ 1000 per year ) ; b ) tumor necrosis factor inhibitor , etanercept ( cost ~ $ 12,000 per year ) . We propose bi-national multi-center randomize , double-blind equivalency trial comparing ( A ) strategy initially add hydroxychloroquine sulfasalazine MTX patient active disease despite MTX , switch 24 week etanercept nonresponders ( B ) strategy add etanercept MTX , switch hydroxychloroquine sulfasalazine nonresponders 24 week . If find strategy first add hydroxychloroquine sulfasalazine MTX identify subset responsive patient harm nonresponders early rescue etanercept , less expensive option become standard treatment MTX resistant patient . Four hundred fifty RA patient active disease despite treatment MTX indicate Disease Activity Score 28 joint ( DAS28 ) great equal 4.4 unit randomize . A DAS improvement great equal 1.2 ( validate clinically significant ) 24 week use identify early nonresponder switch therapy . Subjects DAS28 improvement â‰¥ 1.2 24 week remain initial therapy . The primary endpoint change DAS 28 score baseline 48 week . The secondary endpoint comparison radiographic progression disease 48 week , measure change Sharp score . Economic functional outcome assess serum DNA bank establish evaluate potential biomarkers predictive treatment response/toxicity disease progression . This trial recruit 450 subject 40 month . At end 48 week blind active therapy portion trial , blind broken data collect open fashion 450 patient complete 48 week portion trial .</detailed_description>
