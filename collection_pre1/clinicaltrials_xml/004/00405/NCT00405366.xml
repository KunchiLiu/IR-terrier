	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sorafenib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect well sorafenib work treat patient undergo surgery stage II , stage III , stage IV kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety feasibility systemic sorafenib tosylate therapy give prior definitive nephrectomy patient stage II-IV renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Secondary - Determine level response primary renal tumor patient treated drug . - Assess effect drug gene expression , protein expression , metabolic profile use tumor tissue sample patient . - Identify biomarkers biomarker pattern associate RCC drug patient . OUTLINE : This pilot , open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily 4-8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo surgical resection kidney tumor . Patients undergo blood urine sample collection baseline completion treatment ( i.e. , 4 8* week ) VEGF analysis . Samples examine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement serum urinary VEGF level . NOTE : *Blood sample 8 week patient undergo 8 week study therapy . Patients also undergo tissue sample collection time nephrectomy . Tissue sample examine microarray analysis IHC stain expression CD31/PECAM , HIF1α , HIF2α . Immunohistochemical stain identify biomarkers microvessel density also perform . Tissue sample also examine gene expression metabolic profile small molecule mass spectroscopy , well VHL gene mutation VHL mutation analysis . Patients follow 4-8 week nephrectomy .</detailed_description>
