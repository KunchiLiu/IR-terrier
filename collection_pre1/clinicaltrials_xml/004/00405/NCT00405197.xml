	<brief_summary>Background : During 1990s , prevalence metabolic syndrome Netherlands range 3 % woman 20-39 yr least 33 % men 55 yr old expect increase . Prevention therefore warrant . In respect amount type fat diet deserve attention . Recently , intervention study report diet high mono-unsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) olive oil , increase insulin sensitivity healthy subject . However , additional beneficial effect expect Mediterranean diet whole . Hypothesis : Replacing saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) mono-unsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) improve hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia , typical Mediterranean diet even pronounce effect . Study objectives : To investigate impact Mediterranean diet , especially intake MUFA , marker metabolic syndrome high-risk subject . Methods : The controlled dietary intervention include 60 subject age 40-65 year moderate abdominal obesity . After run-in diet 2 week assign randomly receive one three diet period 8 week . Measurements serum insulin concentration parameter carry week 2 10 . Expected result : Our study provide information role MUFA expect beneficial impact factor Mediterranean type diet metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
