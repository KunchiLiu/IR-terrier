	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Given With Either Anastrozole Fulvestrant With Trastuzumab Postmenopausal Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regimen A : Bevacizumab/anastrozole ( trastuzumab HER2+ patient ) . Bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV every 2 week [ patient also receive trastuzumab option receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 week instead 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( see Trastuzumab section ) ] anastrozole ( 1 mg orally daily ) . Treatment give 4-week cycle . Response assessment perform 2 cycle . Patients respond treatment stable disease continue evaluate every 2 cycle . After 6 month , response assessment occur every 3 month . A patient may remain study radiation deem necessary appropriate , provide site measurable disease outside field radiation may follow . Treatment occur disease progression . Patients select treatment arm per follow guideline : &gt; =12 month adjuvant endocrine therapy OR &gt; =12 month adjuvant aromatase inhibitor OR Endocrine therapy naive OR Prior tamoxifen exposure tamoxifen intolerance Regimen B : Bevacizumab/fulvestrant ( trastuzumab HER2+ patient ) . Bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV every 2 week [ patient also receive trastuzumab option receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 week instead 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( see Trastuzumab section ) ] fulvestrant ( 500 mg intramuscular Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow 250 mg intramuscular fulvestrant Day 15 Cycle 1 . On Day 1 Cycle 2 first day subsequent cycle thereafter , patient treatment arm receive 250 mg intramuscularly fulvestrant ) . Treatment give 4-week cycle . Response assessment perform 2 cycle . Patients respond treatment stable disease continue evaluate every 2 cycle . After 6 month , response assessment occur every 3 month . A patient may remain study radiation deem necessary appropriate , provide site measurable disease outside field radiation may follow . Treatment occur disease progression . Patients select treatment arm per follow guideline : &lt; 12 month adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy OR Intolerant aromatase inhibitor OR Disease progression adjuvant aromatase inhibitor OR Physician discretion Trastuzumab : Patients Treatment Arm A Treatment Arm B FISH HER2+ IHC3+ breast cancer also receive treatment trastuzumab addition treatment combination bevacizumab either anastrozole fulvestrant . Trastuzumab administer ONLY patient HER2+ breast cancer ( FISH-positive IHC3+ ) . An 8 mg/kg load dose IV trastuzumab administer Day 1 , follow dose 6 mg/kg IV trastuzumab every 3 week . These patient option receive bevacizumab dose 15 mg/kg every 3 week rather 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( prefer keep bevacizumab dose schedule consistent trastuzumab dose schedule number visit must make study site minimize ) . The dosing schedule anastrozole ( HER2+ patient Treatment Arm A ) fulvestrant ( HER2+ patient Treatment Arm B ) change .</detailed_description>
