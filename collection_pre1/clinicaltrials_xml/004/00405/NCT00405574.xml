	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , phase II study safety efficacy two dose level oral ATN-224 patient prostate cancer rise serum PSA absence detectable disease . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) confirmation eligibility requirement . The primary endpoint determine proportion patient PSA progression 24 week . PSA progression define least 50 % increase PSA &gt; 5 ng/mL baseline post-treatment nadir low baseline , confirm another PSA least 28 day later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ATN-224 orally active , small molecule show cellular animal model anti-angiogenic activity prostate cancer cell line . ATN-224 potential affect progression prostate cancer mechanism include antiangiogenic antitumor pathway . ATN-224 may change time overt metastatic disease patient rise PSA manifestation disease treatment curative intent delay need hormonal therapy .</detailed_description>

Patients may receive previous castrate hormonal therapy antiandrogens , provide testosterone level &gt; 150 ng/dL time study entry . Prior chemotherapy also allow long requirement adequate organ marrow function meet . No detectable disease assess physical examination bone CT ( abdomen pelvis ) scan within 4 week prior first dose ATN224 A minimum three PSA value , least 4 week apart , calculate PSADT . The last PSA level prior enrollment must least 2.0 ng/mL rise prior value . Age ≥18 year Life expectancy great 6 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥50 % ; see Appendix A ) Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/uL platelets ≥100,000/uL hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2 X ULN creatinine clearance ( measure calculate ) ≥30 mL/min serum testosterone &gt; 150 ng/mL return pretreatment value patient receive hormone therapy Patients allow receive erythropoietin blood transfusion receive first dose ATN224 bring hemoglobin level &gt; 9 g/dL meet eligibility criterion .
