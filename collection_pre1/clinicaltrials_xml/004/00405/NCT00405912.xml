	<brief_title>St. John 's Wort Tobacco Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke single important preventable cause morbidity , mortality excess health care cost United States . The prevalence cigarette smoking among U.S. adult decline 42 % 1965 20.9 % 2004 . However , overall decline occur rate meet national health objective 2010 . Available pharmacotherapies treatment tobacco dependence efficacious tobacco user overall estimate efficacy approximately 20 % long-term tobacco cessation . Thus , novel pharmacotherapies tobacco cessation need explore . Current smoker tend young less education belong low socioeconomic status . Tobacco cessation treatment expensive often cover Medicare , Medicaid , third party-payers . Our goal evaluate novel , safe , acceptable , effective , inexpensive therapy increase tobacco abstinence rate . The United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) guideline recommend nicotine replacement therapy bupropion first-line agent treatment tobacco dependence . Bupropion act central dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibition . St. John 's Wort ( SJW ) , widely use herbal product treat mild moderate depression , share similar mechanism action available tobacco cessation aid number over-the-counter preparation . While currently approve pharmacotherapies tobacco dependence cost $ 120- $ 240 per month , SJW relatively inexpensive ( $ 15 per month ) well-tolerated . At present , randomized prospective study St. John 's Wort tobacco cessation publish . We plan test efficacy SJW tobacco cessation randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , three-arm , parallel group , dose-ranging clinical trial . We obtain preliminary data efficacy two different oral dos SJW improve tobacco abstinence rate decrease symptom nicotine withdrawal . All subject receive behavioral intervention participation study . A total 120 subject recruit study randomly allocate one three group ( group A , B , C ) . Participants group A receive SJW 300-mg three time day twelve week participant group B receive SJW 600-mg three time day twelve week . Participants group C receive match placebo duration . We conduct research Nicotine Research Program ( NRP ) Mayo Clinic Rochester , Minnesota . We uniquely situate complete research 7,500 patient enrol 75 clinical trial conduct NRP . We propose follow specific aim : Primary Aims : 1 . To obtain preliminary evidence effect 12-week course SJW two different oral dos 300-mg three time day 600-mg three time day compare placebo 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence rate end treatment six month 120 smoker . Hypothesis : Cigarette smoker receive SJW two different oral dos 300-mg three time day 600-mg three time day 12 week higher 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence rate end treatment six month compare cigarette smoker receive placebo . Secondary Aim : 1 . To obtain preliminary estimate effect 12-week course SJW two different oral dos 300-mg three time day 600-mg three time day compare placebo prolonged tobacco abstinence rate six month . Hypothesis : Cigarette smoker receive SJW two different oral dos 300-mg three time day 600-mg three time day 12-weeks high prolong tobacco abstinence rate six month compare cigarette smoker receive placebo . This study innovative test novel therapeutic agent treatment tobacco use . At completion study , expect obtain preliminary evidence regard effect two different dos SJW symptom nicotine withdrawal tobacco abstinence . We also collect information adverse effect SJW tobacco user obtain data plan large Phase III clinical trial , result trial suggest potential efficacy .</detailed_description>
