	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy Different Regimes Reintroduction Anti-TB Drugs Anti-TB Drugs Induced Liver Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis continue major health problem develop developed country resurgence immunosuppressed patient . Short course chemotherapy contain isoniazid , rifampicin pyrazinamide prove highly effective treatment tuberculosis . One adverse effect liver damage common side effect lead interruption therapy . There lack consensus guideline treatment anti-TB drug induce liver damage Whether re-introduction take place drug give together full dos ( reduces chance resistance cost patient ) phase manner . There lack study compare different regimen re-introduction anti-TB drug . In study , study three regime re-introduction hepatotoxic anti-tuberculosis drug ( Rifampicin , Isoniazide , Pyrazinamide ) . These potent anti-tuberculosis medication need restart patient develop liver toxicity attribute medication become normal medicine stop . At time re-introduction patient randomize 3 group . - First group receive Isoniazide ( 5mg/kg/day ) , Rifampicin ( 10mg/kg/day ) Pyrazinamide ( 25mg/kg/day ) full dos day 1 continue . - second group receive Rifampicin ( 10mg/kg/day ) full dose day 1 continue , Isoniazide ( 5mg/kg/day ) full dose day 8 continue , Pyrazinamide ( 25mg/kg/day ) day 15 continue . - Third group receive 100 mg/day Isoniazide day 1 gradually increase maximum dose ( 5mg/kg/day ) day 4 continue . Rifampicin introduce day 8 dose 150 mg/day gradually increase maximum dose ( 10mg/kg/day ) day 11 continue . Pyrazinamide introduced day 15 dose 500mg/day gradually increase maximum dose ( 25mg/kg/day ) day 18 continue . All three group monitor three month analyze weekly liver function test . Any difference morbidity , derange liver function adverse effect monitor treat appropriately .</detailed_description>
