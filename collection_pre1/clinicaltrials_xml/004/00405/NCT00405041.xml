	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Study Assess Efficacy Dietary Ingredient Patients With Herniated Lumbar Disc Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herniated lumbar disc exert pressure nerve spine lead pain , numbness , tingle weakness leg , sometimes term `` sciatica '' . This syndrome affect 1-2 % population , usually age 30 50 ( prime work year ) lead significant economic impact . Injuries nerve lead degeneration parent nerve cell , neuron . Recent evidence indicate herniated lumbar disc exert mechanical pressure spinal nerve root lead local ischemia inflammation result nerve injury ( i.e . neurotrauma ) . This neurotrauma lead degeneration correspond nerve cell ( dorsal root ganglion sensory neuron spinal cord motoneuron ) , result persistent deficit motor function , sensation pain . Enhancing nerve cell survival capability ( i.e. , neuroprotection ) , therefore , prove novel therapeutic strategy slow prevent degeneration neuron result herniated lumbar disc compression . Yet , spite intensive search , clinically effective safe neuroprotective therapeutic available . The active ingredient dietary/medical food supplement study discover efficacious neuroprotective agent . The original finding , confirm laboratory throughout world , indicate active compound unique act multiple molecular target exert robust neuropeotective effect . The active ingredient find many plant , fish meet foodstuff use sell food supplement nutraceutical . Its use neuroprotective agent patent thus , constitutes ideal candidate neuroprotective treatment herniated lumbar disc spine skeletal pathology cause nerve compression . The safety dietary supplement study clearly demonstrate recent clinical trial . Results trial demonstrate improvement general health status indicate efficacy alleviate symptom participant herniated lumbar disc spine skeletal pathology cause nerve root compression . The present study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial design ascertain therapeutic efficacy dietary supplement participant herniated lumbar disc cause nerve damage symptom . The study conduct two medical center Israel . Eighty participant presently recruit screened strict inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible individual invite participate signing detail informed consent prior begin study . The participant assign randomly receive either dietary ingredient placebo blind fashion whereby neither treat physician participant aware type treatment .</detailed_description>
