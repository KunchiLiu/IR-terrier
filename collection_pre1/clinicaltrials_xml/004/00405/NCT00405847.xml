	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Effect Dexmedetomidine Sleep Inflammation Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 1 million patient receive mechanical ventilation every year United States . In mechanically ventilated patient , despite sedative infusion , sleep severely disrupt . Sleep disruption , turn , lead activation sympathetic nervous system elevate inflammatory cytokine . Both sympathetic hyperactivity elevate cytokine associate delirium , , turn , associate increase mortality high healthcare cost . Currently , however , little understanding inter-relationship critical illness , sleep , neuropsychological well-being . The purpose study collect preliminary data short-term effect sedation without sympatholysis sleep inflammation critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilation . This pilot study accomplish perform sleep study circulate cytokine measurement critically ill patient randomize receive two different sedation strategy : Dexmedetomidine versus Midazolam Fentanyl . The ultimate goal program research identify sedation practice least associated adverse short- long-term consequence , thereby ultimately help improve sleep quality quality life patient survive critical illness .</detailed_description>
