	<brief_title>A Study Compare MPR With MP Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Subjects 65 Years Old Older .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three phase study originally define represent result 11 May 2010 : Double-blind Treatment Phase : Induction Melphalan/prednisone lenalidomide 10 mg ( MPR ) ( 2 treatment arm ) , melphalan/prednisone placebo ( MPp ) ( 1 treatment arm ) 9 cycle . If disease progression , subject option enter Open-Label Extension Phase . There also option enter Follow-Up Phase . If disease progress , subject continue blind therapy Maintenance . Double-blind Treatment Phase : Maintenance One MPR treatment arm ( MPR+R ) continue take lenalidomide 10 mg Maintenance . The MPR treatment arm ( MPR+p ) take placebo Maintenance . The MP p treatment arm take placebo Maintenance ( MPp+p ) . If disease progression , subject option enter Open-Label Extension Phase obtain treatment lenalidomide , enter Follow-up Phase . Open-label Extension Phase : Treatment consist oral lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) without dexamethasone disease progression treatment discontinue reason study subject follow least 5 year date randomization die . Subjects discontinue Open-Label Extension Phase prior complete total 5 year study enter Follow-up Phase . Follow-up Phase : Subjects follow overall survival subsequent anti-myeloma treatment regimens subject study follow least 5 year randomization die . The pre-planned interim analysis Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) show difference progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment arm MPR+R MPp+p ( define primary comparative analysis study ) surpass pre-specified O'Brien-Fleming boundary superiority . The IDMC recommend release information sponsor also recommend patient physician study participant receive information concern full finding MM-015 interim analysis . Therefore , due recommendation IDMC , treatment-arm code send clinical trial center unblind treatment arm study subject amend protocol review approve respective country Health Authorities Ethics Committees . Subject participation MM-015 study continue unblinding obtain long-term data study endpoint , include overall survival . When study unblinded , subject still protocol therapy complete Double-Blind Induction , monotherapy Double-Blind Maintenance . Subjects arm MPR+R continue monotherapy lenalidomide . Subjects arm MPR+p MPp+p discontinue placebo monotherapy go observation period antimyeloma therapy take . If disease progress subject , investigator option enter subject Open Label Extension Phase receive lenalidomide therapy ( 25 mg daily ) Follow-up Phase . All subject follow least 5 year start study .</detailed_description>
