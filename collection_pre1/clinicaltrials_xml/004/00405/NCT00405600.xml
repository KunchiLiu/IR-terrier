	<brief_summary>The goal spinal fusion relieve pain and/or increase stability painful unstable spine joint . A patient may may receive rod screw use bone graft material facilitate bone growth fusion thus prevent movement bone spine . In research study , bone graft substitute material call Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 know BMP-2 Infuse use . No hip bone use . The surgical procedure consist BMP-2 Infuse without use rod screw .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spine Fusion Instrumented With BMP-2 v Uninstrumented With Infuse BMP-2 Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study use BMP-2 Infuse instead iliac crest bone graft spinal fusion . The BMP-2 Infuse research complete clinical trial spinal fusion . It demonstrate equivalence iliac crest bone graft regard fusion rate clinical outcome . Currently , acceptable standard care spinal fusion surgery require instrument non-instrumented procedure use bone graft material , facilitate bone growth , fusion , thus eliminate movement incite vertebra . In study , surgical procedure BMP-2 Infuse instrumentation BMP-2 Infuse alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patient currently participate drug medical clinical trial . Patient sign informed consent . Patient willing available examination schedule study duration . Patient clinical radiologic history degenerative disc disease spondylolisthesis ( great grade 1 utilize Meyerding 's classification ( Meyerding HW , 1932 ) ) ; spinal stenosis conservative treatment fail lumbar spinal fusion indicate . Eligible noninstrumented instrumented surgical procedure Has one two level ( contiguous ) involvement L1S1 require fusion Has preoperative Oswestry score great 30 Has respond nonoperative treatment period 6 month ( bed rest , physical therapy , medication , manipulation , spinal injection , ) . Is least 20 year age inclusive day surgery If female childbearing potential , patient nonpregnant , nonnursing , agree use adequate contraception one year follow surgery . Patient systemic infection . Patient one previous nonfusion spinal surgery involve level . Patient require fusion 2 level . Patient pseudoarthroses previous fusion attempt . Patient highly communicable disease , inflammatory autoimmune disease ( e.g.osteomyelitis , crohn 's , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus , gout , HIV/AIDS , active tuberculosis , venereal disease , active hepatitis ) . A note file write investigator permit patient study experience mild case affect outcome study . Has previously diagnose osteopenia , osteoporosis , osteomalacia degree spinal instrumentation would contraindicate Patient significant medical history , Investigator 's opinion would make good study candidate . Patient require interbody cage fusion nonpedicle screw instrumentation . Pregnancy . Has presence active malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma skin ) Has history severe allergy ( anaphylaxis ) Is grossly obese , i.e . weight 40 % ideal height age . Has fever ( temperature 101 F oral ) Has allergy BMP2 Has allergy bovine product Has allergy collagen implant Is mentally incompetent ( questionable , obtain psychiatric consult ) Is prisoner , transient treat inpatient substance abuse program alcohol and/or drug abuse within six month prior propose study enrollment . Has receive drug may interfere bone metabolism within two week prior plan surgery Has diagnosis , require postoperative medication interfere fusion , steroid . Has history endocrine metabolic disorder know affect osteogenesis ( e.g . Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , EhlersDanios syndrome osteogenesis imperfecta )</criteria>
