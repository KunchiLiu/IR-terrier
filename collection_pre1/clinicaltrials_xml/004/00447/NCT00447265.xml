	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) chronic , multisystem , autoimmune disease body 's immune system attack normal tissue . This abnormal autoimmune response result damage many part body , include skin , joint , lung , heart , brain , intestine , kidney . Kidney problem occur 60-75 % lupus patient . The development lupus-related kidney disease ( call lupus nephritis ) associate overall bad prognosis . SLE usually treat drug try block inflammation cause immune system . These treatment create problem cure lupus . The drug often use treat lupus nephritis include prednisone ( steroid ) , cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , azathioprine ( AZA Imuran ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF Cellcept ) . The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability etanercept compare placebo combination standard care treat individual active lupus nephritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etanercept Treatment Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney problem associate lupus nephritis range asymptomatic protein urine rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis , lead end-stage renal disease . The goal therapy control kidney manifestation order avoid kidney failure , occurrence medical problem death . The treatment lupus nephritis remain problematic . Despite use currently available therapy , patient experience disease relapse . Over time , patient develop significant morbidity disease well medication use treatment . Etanercept , TNF inhibitor , propose potential treatment lupus nephritis . TNF increase number reactive B T cell . TNF level elevate lupus . Etanercept believe work block inflammation , hop lessen sign symptom lupus-related kidney disease . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability etanercept compare placebo combination standard therapy treat individual mild moderately active lupus nephritis . This study last 1 year . Participants randomly assign receive either etanercept placebo addition regular medication . Participants self-administer 50 mg etanercept placebo injection week . They continue receive usual treatment corticosteroid either MMF , Mycophenolic Acid , AZA . Treatment study medication occur 24 week . There screen visit follow randomization visit , subject receive learn administer study drug . Subjects come clinic 9 study visit . A physical exam blood urine collection occur study visit . Participants also ask complete questionnaire health study visit . Subjects contact phone 5 time 24-week period assess adverse event worsen disease status .</detailed_description>
