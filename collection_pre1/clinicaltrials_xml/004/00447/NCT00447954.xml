	<brief_summary>The purpose study look safety effectiveness CNTF implant vision participant atrophic macular degeneration . This research do effective therapy people atrophic macular degeneration . Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) condition affect macula , central part retina use see detail . There two type AMD , one wet type new blood vessel grow , also know choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) , dry type healthy cell die , target study . This call atrophic macular degeneration . The implant small capsule contains human retinal pigment epithelium cell . These cell give ability make CNTF release capsule membrane surround fluid . In study , two different CNTF dose level use : high dose low dose , well sham surgery ( placebo ) group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Encapsulated Cell Technology ( ECT ) Implant Patients With Atrophic Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve 18 visit 1Â½ year specific test participant 's vision health . These visit may include visual exam , blood draw laboratory testing , brief medical history exam , occasionally questionnaire ( survey ) , addition visit surgical procedure . There 8 center participate study , 48 people enrol , across US . Each participant joining study complete initial screening schedule brief surgical procedure perform one eye , may may include small cell-filled implant . Follow-up visit repeat assessment require regularly determine implant test safe effective use treat AMD .</detailed_description>
