Through study perform RO3 fund National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , demonstrate frequent tanner , appearance less important UV-induced relaxation motivate tan behavior . Moreover , determine UV light reinforce property apart psychosocial benefit tan . One subject study report low back pain relief UV exposure condition . This two-year proposal begin long-term plan ass whether indoor tan ultraviolet light exposure therapeutic effect patient chronic pain . To end , determine effect UV light fibromyalgia pain control , double blind clinical trial UV exposure . This approach carefully design separate effect UV exposure pain potential confounds associate tanning procedure , include perceive benefit tan .
