	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Treatment Manual Development : Psychoeducation , Dyadic Communication Adversity , Stress inoculation training skill building , Cognitive processing restructuring , Exposure constructive narrative.Reconstruction positive future relapse prevention.. WAIT-LIST CONTROL STUDY Once treatment manual develop , move immediately pilot test treatment bereave family . The design pilot study repeat measure compare two group three time point assessment : ( pre-treatment , immediately post-treatment , 3 month post-treatment ) . Although outcome assess , primary outcome measure bereavement measure marital adjustment . The three month follow-up result compare pre-treatment result use intent-to-treat analysis last observation carry forward . As treatment last 13 16 session , wait-list control group 's welfare concern . We use weekly phone conversation check wait-list participant . If appear deteriorating , immediately refer treatment . Wait-list participant offer treatment end wait-list period . It note contact wait-list period represent attention provide wait-list participant , thus make design somewhat conservative . It primary purpose study establish preliminary efficacy investigate effect size associate treatment , develop treatment manual , required tool conduct full efficacy trial . Participants . Participants parent live Israel lose child , least 6 month post loss ( follow Shear ) , age 21 , provide inform consent , score &gt; 30 Inventory Complicated Grief .

Participants provide free treatment , need income restriction provide aid defray transportation cost clinic . Subject Recruitment . We use various method recruitment , include press well work partner organization deal parental bereavement , recruitment train therapist work different clinical setting . Assessor Training . Assessors train measure They psychometric measure use specify manual pertain use . Independent Assessment . Assessors keep unaware treatment condition person . Demographics Bereavement History . In addition standard demographic information , obtain detailed information circumstance surround child 's death . Psychiatric History . Axis I disorder assess use Structured Clinical Interview DSM-III-R ( SCID-1 ) .The SCID semi-structured interview commonly use research setting ass subject 's psychiatric history . Bereavement . Adaptation bereavement measure use Inventory Complicated Grief ( ICG ) .This 19 item self report measure maladaptive symptom loss describe author . Responses give Likert scale . PTSD . PTSD measure clinician administer measure ( CAPS ) self-report measure ( PDS ) .The CAPS 30 item interview provide diagnosis PTSD base 17 symptom DSM-IV define disorder include frequency intensity symptom . It also provide measure impact symptoms patient 's social occupational functioning , overall severity symptom complex , patient 's global improvement since baseline , validity rating obtain . Depression . Depression measure SCID-I32 ( describe ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI- II ) . The BDI ( subsequently , BDI-II ) widely use instrument measure severity depression ` gold standard ' among self-report measure depression .

Any participant identify increase risk suicidal ideation monitor closely . A clinical consensus conference hold additional treatment recommend provide need . Treatment Fidelity . Treatment session audiotaped . Treatment fidelity raters train 85 % reliability level . Twenty-five percent session randomly review ( stratify session number ) rat adherence protocol . Ten percent session rat second rater insure reliability maintain , guard rater drift . DATA ANALYSES The design repeat measure ( pre-treatment , post-treatment , 3 month follow-up ) comparison intervention wait-list control condition . We assess treatment efficacy examine change pre-treatment three-month follow-up score use intent-to-treat analysis ( carry last observation forward ) . To avoid loss power associate test many hypothesis , select a-priori primary outcome analyze ( 1 ) complicate grief symptom ( ICG ) ( 2 ) marital adjustment . An analysis change score equivalent repeat measure analysis compare baseline three-month follow-up . For outcome measure , analysis covariance use change score compare intervention wait-list condition , control baseline score measure . HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH Sources Data Baseline assessment include demographic data , psychiatric history , current psychiatric diagnosis , description death child , relationship information , social function information . Only staff work parental bereavement project access subject identity . Any identify subject data store separately rest data . All data collect in-person interview self-report questionnaire .

Potential Risks The principal risk subject participate study include possible emotional distress recall painful story death child . The goal present clinical trial alleviate emotional distress long-term basis . It also possible subject randomize wait-list control deterioration symptom prior participate research protocol . We monitor weekly 15-minute phone check-in ass psychiatric status . Immediate treatment referral provide event deterioration .

Protection Data Any identifying subject data store separately patient data . While store separately , set data store locked cabinet lock room . Scientific presentation publication use subject name use aggregate data . Data entry do twice compare establish accuracy . After entry , data check variable range internal consistency use SPSS . Data Safety Monitoring Plan A DSMB establish monitor project . In addition , phase project , data collection monitor monthly PI individual supervision , project team meeting random review session audiotape write transcript . Monthly report generate note problem encounter treatment drop participant . Any adverse event occur consent treatment phase report immediately PI . Adverse event also report IRB NIH . Specifically , serious adverse event associate study procedure , and/or incident involve conduct study patient participation , include problem consent process report .
