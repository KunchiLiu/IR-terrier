	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate experimental device treatment depress phase Bipolar Disorder Type II . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) experimental procedure device delivers alternate magnetic field focal area brain . When coil place scalp left frontal area head , magnetic field focus region brain think involved depression . This study intend test rTMS affect region brain way improve symptom depression relate Bipolar Disorder Type II . The purpose study obtain safety efficacy information regard use rTMS ( Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ) patient depressed phase Bipolar Disorder Type II .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind randomized control trial rTMS outpatient depressive phase BD-II . Participants evaluate UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas . Forty eligible subject randomize either active treatment ( n=20 ) sham ( stimulation , n=20 ) . Each subject receive treatment 5 day per week total 6 week . At end 6 week , remain depressed option receive 6 additional week open rTMS treatment . We require participant meet eligibility criterion open phase ( i.e . MADRS ≥15 , YMRS &lt; 12 ) initial double blind phase . At completion treatment , follow-up appointment schedule study physician ensure participant properly transition clinical care significant change clinical status . Those already treat physician refer new provider .</detailed_description>
