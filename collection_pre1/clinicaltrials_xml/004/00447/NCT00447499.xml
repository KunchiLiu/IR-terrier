	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether subject acromegaly ( partner ) able self administer Somatuline Autogel home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Ability Subjects With Acromegaly Their Partners Administer Somatuline Autogel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical experience Somatuline Autogel date raise possibility self partner injection . Previous microparticle somatostatin analogue formulation require careful reconstitution result cost analogue inconvenience reconstitution mean self partner injection viable option . Somatuline Autogel require reconstitution come ready-mixed pre-filled syringe , thus make user-friendly predecessor introduce possibility self partner injection . Patients acromegaly often travel considerable distance every 28 day order receive somatostatin analogue injection clinic . If Somatuline Autogel safely administer unsupervised , maintain disease control , could offer patient considerable benefit term reduce frequency visit clinic . This study design allow suitably motivated patient acromegaly partner learn successfully inject Somatuline Autogel maintain mean GH level control . Disease control patient assess compare GH IGF-1 level accept medical standard control acromegaly compare level GH IGF-1 control achieve baseline value .</detailed_description>
