	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer remain second common cancer worldwide.Although prognosis poor majority patient , long term survival achievable patient surgical resection possible . However result surgery generally disapointing large series.The exception appear Japan far east standardized approach surgery undertaken low morbidity mortality.The extent surgery particularly development systematic lymphadenectomy ( D2 ) credit Japan improve outcome patient gastric cancer . Hence compare difference D1 D2 lymphadenectomy gastric cancer term overall survival , disease free survival loco regional recurrence also post operative morbidity mortality follow procedure , study undertaken . In D1 lymphadenectomy , lymph node adjacent part stomach resect removed.In D2 lymphadenectomy lymph node drain stomach also remove accord internationally accept guideline also include resection great omentum along anterior layer transverse mesocolon less omentum upto attachment hepatoduodenal ligament . Currently procedures widely practise worldwide definite evidence show superiority one procedure other.Neither procedure experimental . We trial see whether one procedure superior .</brief_summary>
