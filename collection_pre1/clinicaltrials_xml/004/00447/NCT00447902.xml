	<brief_summary>The main purpose study : demonstrate safety efficacy TPV/r among HCV hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) co-infected HIV+population , three-class ( NRTI , NNRTI , PI ) experience , document resistance one PI . Determine pharmacokinetic data co-infected population potential utility use therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) improve efficacy outcome .</brief_summary>
