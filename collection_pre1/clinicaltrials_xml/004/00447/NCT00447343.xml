	<brief_summary>Decompressive surgery relieve symptom spinal cord compression due dysfunction , arthritis , prove variable success . Past research report approximately one-third surgery patient improve , one-third remain one-third worsen . Currently , reliable test predict outcome following surgery . We hop study change . Using functional MRI ( fMRI ) , wish investigate relationship clinical symptom recovery brain activation follow surgery . One also track concentration different chemical ( metabolite ) use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . We hypothesize recovery normal brain activation pattern coincide clinical improvement . Our objective study explore potential role fMRI tool prognose patient cervical myelopathy . Twenty-five patient cervical myelopathy image use high-powered ( 3 Tesla ) fMRI scanner six month follow surgery . In addition , ten healthy control image provide baseline measure . Both patient control group complete questionnaire time scan . These provide information concern subjective experience individual throughout recovery . We compare brain activation pattern control patient group investigate brain heals follow decompressive surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Degenerative arthritis universal concomitant human aging , affect 51 % adult population . Arthritis spine common cause acquire spinal cord dysfunction manifest subtle symptom , diminish balance dexterity , profound symptom , paralysis incontinence . In case dysfunction result severe spinal cord compression , surgery perform . However , surgical outcome always beneficial . Past research report approximately one-third surgery patient improve , one-third remain one-third worsen . Currently , reliable test predict outcome following surgery . We hop study change . Twenty-five patient undergo 45 minute image session pre-operatively six month post-operatively . Ten control undergo 45 minute imaging session twice provide baseline comparison reproducibility . During session , one motor task ( finger tap ) 1 sensory task ( hand brush ) perform 2 minute 10 second interval . We wish compare change volume extent , location , intensity brain activation level surgery . We also compare fMRI signal response difference control patient . We hypothesize degree brain activation shift towards normalcy ( control ) correlate degree neurological recovery postoperatively . Data analyze use software develop Robarts Research Institute .</detailed_description>
