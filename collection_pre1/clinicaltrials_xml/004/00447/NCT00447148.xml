	<brief_summary>Aim study evaluate whether length coronary segment , assess experienced operator , use `` optimal view '' standard 2-dimensional coronary angiography , over/underestimated respect one evaluate automatically help 3-dimensional coronary reconstruction model . Moreover , technique compare `` in-vivo '' surrogate real length coronary segment evaluation , i.e . intra-coronary marker guide-wire , wire marker place fix know distance along length distal ( intra-coronary ) part . Two hypothesis test : ( 1 ) length coronary segment evaluate standard 2-dimensional `` optimal view '' over/underestimates length assess 3-dimensional coronary model automatically detect least foreshortened length segment evaluation , ( 2 ) 3-dimensional model approximate closely standard 2-dimensional angiography , real length segment detect marker guide-wire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The potential improve accuracy assessment coronary tree mean 3-D model reconstruction may lead evaluation coronary artery anatomy approximate correctly real anatomy , thus subsequently lead tailor diagnosis therapy patient ischemic heart disease . Aim current study ass whether 3-D model coronary tree offer less foreshortened less operator-dependent evaluation length coronary artery respect standard coronary angiography . Furthermore , first time `` in-vivo '' , comparison `` real '' length vessel perform use `` gold standard '' intra-coronary guide-wire radiopaque marker fix know distance one along distal part .</detailed_description>
