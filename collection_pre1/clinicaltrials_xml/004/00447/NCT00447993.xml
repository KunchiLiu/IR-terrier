	<brief_summary>The purpose study look safety effectiveness CNTF implant vision person retinitis pigmentosa , Usher type II &amp; III , Choroideremia . This research do effective therapy people retinal degeneration . They genetic disorder affect ability see night , later cause tunnel vision loss central vision . Retinal degeneration affect retina , light sensitive layer cell back eye . Slowly time , cell die cause permanent loss vision . The implant small capsule contains human retinal pigment epithelium cell . These cell give ability make CNTF release capsule membrane surround fluid . This study look effect implant vision loss retinitis pigmentosa , Usher type II &amp; III , Choroideremia . In study , two different CNTF dose level use : high dose low dose one eye , well sham ( placebo ) surgery eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Encapsulated Cell Technology ( ECT ) Implant Patients With Late Stage Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve 16 visit 1Â½ year specific test participant 's vision health . These visit may include visual exam , blood draw laboratory testing , brief medical history exam , occasionally questionnaire ( survey ) , addition visit surgical procedure . The primary effectiveness outcome study visual acuity score one year implant surgery . There 13 center participate study , 60 people enrol across US . Each participant joining study complete initial screening schedule brief surgical procedure perform eye , one include small cell-filled implant . Follow-up visit repeat assessment require regularly determine implant test safe effective use treat RP .</detailed_description>
