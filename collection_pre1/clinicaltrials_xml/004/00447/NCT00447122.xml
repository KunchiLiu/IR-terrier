	<criteria>Patients require histologically pathologically confirm , metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas No prior chemotherapy pancreatic cancer . ECOG performance status 01 Must retain ability swallow oral medication Age &gt; 18 . Because dose adverse event data currently available use lapatinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Women child bear potential must non pregnant non lactating.The effect lapatinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman child bear potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : Has hysterectomy , Has bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) , Has bilateral tubal ligation , Is postmenopausal ( demonstration total cessation menses ³1 year ) . Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior treatment rule pregnancy . Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment . Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) , Vasectomized partner sterile prior female subject 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse two week exposure investigational product , throughout clinical trial , least one week last dose investigational product . Double barrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam , suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm ) . Vasectomy Adequate hematologic function : ANC ≥ 1500/ul , platelet ≥ 100,000/ul . Adequate hepatic function total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ALT AST ≤ 2x ULN . ( Patients liver metastasis may AST/ALT less equal 5x upper limit normal ) . Adequate renal function : creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram MUGA scan . Note baseline treatment scan perform use modality preferably institution . Life expectancy least 12 week Signed informed consent A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Prior treatment lapatinib EGFR target therapy . Prior treatment systemic chemotherapy pancreatic cancer . Clinical evidence brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Active cardiac disease , define : History uncontrolled angina Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month study entry Uncontrolled symptomatic congestive heart failure Ejection fraction institutional normal limit Any cardiac condition , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient The subject know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate study drug . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction lapatinib Participation investigational study within 28 day prior study enrolment Any major surgery ( insertion vascular access device laparoscopy consider major surgery ) , within last 4 week . Pregnant lactating female exclude study lapatinib member 4anilinoquinazoline class kinase inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lapatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated lapatinib . Uncontrolled malabsorption syndrome significantly affect gastrointestinal function major resection stomach small bowel could affect absorption lapatinib . Any unresolved bowel obstruction . The patient inadequate venous access clinical judgment investigator designate clinical staff . Patient take medication prohibit medication list Patients require oral anticoagulant ( coumadin , warfarin ) eligible provide increased vigilance respect monitoring INR . If medically appropriate treatment available , investigator may also consider switch patient LMW heparin , interaction lapatinib expect . Patients may receive investigational agent receive concurrent anticancer therapy .</criteria>
