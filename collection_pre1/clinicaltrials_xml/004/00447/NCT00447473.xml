	<brief_title>Trial GM-CSF Given Combination With Ketoconazole Mitoxantrone Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . Hormonal ablation , form medical surgical castration cornerstone management metastatic prostate cancer however , treatment option patient androgen ablation fails limit . Second-line hormonal agent generally associate low response rate document survival benefit . A variety taxane-based regimen test hormone refractory prostate cancer , yield response rate 38 % - 69 % . As response taxane-based regimen appear exceed typically associate mitoxantrone plus prednisone , taxane-based therapy widely use community , typically first line therapy . Second line therapy , non-taxane base comparable activity exist . This study build experience drug development advance prostate cancer demonstrate follow : 1 . Ketoconazole produce serologic objective clinical response 50 % patient disease progression oral antiandrogen . 2 . GM-CSF , potent stimulator dendritic cell , demonstrate clinical activity prostate cancer . 3 . GM-CSF well tolerate patient prostate cancer . The addition GM-CSF antitumor therapy may augment T cell response apoptotic tumor cell therefore may improve clinical benefit produce agent . 4 . The addition mitoxantrone ketoconazole demonstrate improved clinical benefit relative publish data single agent . The importance trial broader context clinical research prostate cancer twofold : One , represent attempt offer second line immunotherapy plus chemotherapy patient fail prior frontline taxane base therapy . Two , first trial assess combination GM-CSF plus ketoconazole mitoxantrone .</detailed_description>

Progressive disease androgen deprivation . Patients receive antiandrogen part primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression follow discontinuation antiandrogen . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60 % . One prior taxane base chemotherapy prostate cancer . No two prior systemic therapy . At least four week lapse since prior therapy . Patients may prior ketoconazole , aminoglutethimide corticosteroid treatment progressive prostate cancer . Patients receive hormonal therapy , include dose megestrol acetate ( Megace ) , Proscar ( finasteride ) , herbal product know decrease PSA level ( e.g. , Saw Palmetto PCSPES ) , systemic corticosteroid must discontinue agent least 4 week prior enrollment . Progressive disease must document discontinuation hormonal therapy . Patients stable dos bisphosphonates show subsequent tumor progression may continue medication ; however , patient allow initiate bisphosphonate therapy within one month prior start therapy throughout study .
