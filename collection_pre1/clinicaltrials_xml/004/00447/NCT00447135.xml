	<brief_title>Immunologic Function Elderly After Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injury elderly characterize high mortality rate , long hospital stay increase long term disability control injury severity compare young cohort injury patient . ( 7 ) The great likelihood co-morbid , pre-existing medical condition , negative impact outcome , may part responsible observation . However , disagreement whether impact physiologic age oppose chronological age outcomes whether important determine factor injure elderly . ( 8 ) It clear combination age factor baseline health status may determine ability elderly injured patient recover successfully . This may due age relate degradation immune function either PMN relate cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) relate . In healthy individual , metabolic response hemorrhage , burn injury characterize hyperdynamic metabolic response upregulates proinflammatory/immunologic/metabolic `` milieu '' design heal injury , combat infection prevent death . This inflammatory response part patient functional adaptive physiologic perspective ( 9 ) . Aging known decrease physiologic reserve may play role alter ability injure elderly patient mount adaptive , appropriate , inflammatory response injure ( 10 ) . Some evidence exist document age-related decline immunologic function elderly , particularly portion immune response describe cell mediate immunity [ CMI ] ( 11 ) . This contribute high increase infection elderly ( 12 ) . There also animal model evidence immune function worsen combined injury ( 13 ) . Similarly , hemorrhage , burn injury also depress cell mediate immunity previously healthy individual increase likelihood infection organ system failure result ( 14 ) . Little known , however , nature immuno/inflammatory response injury elderly . Therefore , one hypotheses study age process attenuates immuno/inflammatory response process , adversely impact function nonspecific portion immune defense system main component system , polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) . The systemic immuno/inflammatory response hemorrhage , burn injury well characterized young , healthy volunteer animal model study extensively ( 15 ) . The key feature response attraction PMNs site injury . These `` mature '' PMNs present peripheral bloodstream posse life span approximately 3-5 day . When activate , cell responsible limit microbial invasion promote wound healing . However , prolonged activation cell deleterious lead perpetuation inflammatory response , exacerbate tissue injury lead development organ system injury , condition know multi-system organ failure . Under normal circumstance , process apoptosis , program cellular death , limit life span PMN 2-3 day serve regulate extent immuno/inflammatory response . This allow sufficient time acquire immune system activate come line response cell mediate activity infection antigen . Many normal function innate , non-specific PMN dependent , immune system know dysfunctional young patient sepsis , severe injury shock . It unclear , however , impact present elderly patient injured little know function PMNs elderly patient general , , specifically elderly patient injure . Since elderly patient know , age relate depressed cell mediate immunity , second hypothesis may age related abnormality present PMNs elderly patient injure contribute bad outcome follow injury . The purpose study begin characterize functional status portion innate immune response follow injury elderly trauma patient . This accomplished analysis standard battery functional test characterize PMNs regard apoptosis response immune challenge . These PMN functionality test correlate observed clinical outcome . The null hypothesis study PMNs elderly trauma patient functional characteristic result different local systemic effect PMN 's non-injured elder control non-injured non-elder control may lead different effect post injury impact outcome .</detailed_description>
