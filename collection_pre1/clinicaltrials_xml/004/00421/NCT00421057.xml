	<detailed_description>Cancer-related fatigue describe common troubling side effect cancer cancer treatment . Researchers want see strength-training walk exercise regimen may help reduce severe fatigue increase patient ' ability perform activity daily live . If agree take part study , complete questionnaire , provide contact information , participate 1 2 group .

Participants nonexercise group follow usual routine standard care taught perform specific regimen strength-training walking exercise . Participants nonexercise group ask keep record exercise do participant 's personal regimen part study . You equal chance assign either group . All participant study ask complete questionnaire ( Schwartz Fatigue Scale , Karnofsky Performance Scale , International Physical Activity Questionnaire [ IPAQ ] ) Breast Center Clinic begin chemotherapy treatment . The Schwartz Fatigue Scale IPAQ also complete chemotherapy treatment . All questionnaire use provide information physical activity much time spend . It take 25-30 minute complete 3 questionnaire . No matter group , questionnaires complete , physical therapist escort exercise room locate Physical Therapy Rehabilitation Clinic .

This exercise test perform begin chemotherapy within 2 week finish last chemotherapy treatment . The exercise test do chemotherapy treatment researcher compare level fatigue physical performance experience therapy begin . The ETGUPGo test measure fast rise chair , walk 4 yard , turnaround return chair , sit . For 6-minute walk test therapist ask walk around exercise room pace therapist count total time able walk . Two ( 2 ) week finish treatment , re-take Schwartz Fatigue Scale , Karnofsky Scale , IPAQ , ETGUPGo , 6-minute walk test . Your exercise test do private , mean one study staff allow enter room test . If assign group specific exercise regimen , teach strengthen walk exercise . For strengthen regimen , teach stretch Theraband ( material look like big rubber band ) far arm legs stretch .

You must walk least per day , otherwise may walk often long feel like . You also exercise test . The therapist measure length arm legs see much force take stretch rubber band beyond length arm leg . The therapist test current muscle strength ask sit rise chair , walk certain distance , return chair . You also ask walk certain distance get tire . The therapist record much time take complete exercise ( strengthen walk ) . After begin exercise home , research nurse call every 2 week ask many time perform strengthen exercise throughout week well average amount time walk day . The phone call last 10-15 minute time . You ask check box exercise calendar ( provide ) show exercise able perform day . All exercise test give day routine visit clinic . Your participation complete study perform last exercise testing ( 2 week last chemotherapy treatment ) . This investigational study . However , begin experience emotional distress directly relate study , may refer professional counseling M. D. Anderson Social Work Department .
