	<brief_summary>Administration single high dose ( 10 mg/kg ) AmBisome® later 72 hour ARNF onset follow two 5 mg/kg dos day 2 5 may provide sustain tissue level amphotericin B mycologically effective provide administer standard daily dose 3 mg/kg/day . The new dose regimen anticipate equally clinically effective compare standard AmBisome® regimen give duration neutropenic fever patient ARNF . In addition , degree incidence nephrotoxicity predict low 3 sequential dose regimen compare daily dose 3 mg/kg lower cumulative dosage ( 20 mg/kg versus 42 mg/kg , respectively ) , 1 contribute factor development acute renal failure . Furthermore , low cumulative dose may cost-effective strategy treatment patient ARNF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase III , multicenter , randomize , open-label study . One center United Arab Emirates 1 center Turkey participate trial approximately 50 patient recruit . Patients adults hematological malignancy undergo chemotherapy leukemia lymphoma . These patient treat AmBisome® resolution fever neutropenia maximum 14 day . Patients randomize receive AmBisome 10 mg/kg treatment day 0 follow 5 mg/kg day 2 5 AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day 14 day . Study medication administer period ARNF resolution fever neutropenia and/or minimum 14 day . At end 14-day trial period , patient classify respond responded treatment accord criterion response give . Patients examine daily evidence drug toxicity intolerance development IFI . Vital sign record every 6 hour patient stable frequently evidence clinical deterioration . In event clinical IFI ( i.e. , development halo sign positive fungal blood culture ) , patient withdrawn study , classify treatment failure , receive antifungal treatment either caspofungin voriconazole . Daily clinical observation ensure rapid detection event accordance standard IDSA guidelines4 . Patients show clinical deterioration ( i.e. , increase dyspnea , hypotension ) exhibit definite evidence IFI may also classify treatment failure . Patients evidence biochemical and/or clinical drug toxicity withdrawn study appropriate management give . For patient remain febrile 14 day otherwise stable discernable cause fever , continuation treatment AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day treatment another antifungal drug treatment , antibiotic , discontinuation antimicrobial therapy undertaken discretion investigator . Patients meet criterion thorough diagnostic evaluation investigate cause fever .</detailed_description>
