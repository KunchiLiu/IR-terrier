	<brief_title>Noise-Enhanced Sensory Function Elders Risk Falls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show sub-sensory mechanical noise ( i.e. , random vibration small intensity ) enhance somatosensory function healthy individual older adult somatosensory deficit . Moreover , postural sway healthy young healthy elderly individual quiet stand significantly reduce apply sub-sensory mechanical noise foot use vibrate shoe insole . The specific aim project determine effect noise-enhanced somatosensation foot balance performance elderly individual somatosensory deficit and/or recurrent fall , ass whether adaptation occur noise-enhanced balance control individual . To accomplish aim , quiet-standing dynamic posture study clinical balance assessment conduct elderly individual somatosensory deficit elderly individual recurrent fall ( two fall 12-month period ) . This project could lead development novel bioengineering technique improve balance control old adult patient somatosensory deficit . The work could thus serve reduce frequency , morbidity cost fall , assist age individual achieve maximal independence activity daily live mobility . Two group participant recruit RNH Epidemiology Core : 85 elderly individual somatosensory deficit , 85 elderly individual recurrent fall . The study consist three visit -- one-hour neurological exam , two 6-hour laboratory test session schedule one week apart .</detailed_description>
