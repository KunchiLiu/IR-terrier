	<brief_title>Effect N-Acetylcysteine Peritoneal Membrane Function Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease commonest cause morbidity mortality chronic dialysis patient , include treat CAPD ( Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis ) [ 1 ] . Uncontrolled arterial hypertension ESRF lead progression LVH , strong predictor coronary event , CHF mortality [ 2 ] . Fluid overload major factor pathogenesis arterial hypertension CAPD patient [ 3 ] . Therefore , intervention optimize volume status , hence blood pressure , consider central management patient . Such therapy include restrict dietary sodium water intake , use diuretic patient residual renal function optimization peritoneal ultrafiltration sodium water removal [ 1 ] . As show EAPOS Study , peritoneal ultrafiltration important predictor mortality [ 4 ] . Peritoneal fluid salt removal increase use hypertonic dialysis fluid use glucose osmotic agent . Consistent use hypertonic glucose solution may damage peritoneal membrane may also lead increased systemic absorption glucose subsequent hyperglycemia , increase thirst excessive water drinking . Concerns role glucose deterioration peritoneal membrane function support recent study [ 5 ] . Generally , evolution peritoneal membrane property time characterize progressive increase small solute transport , lead high glucose absorption rate peritoneal fluid loss ultrafiltration capacity [ 6 ] . Such high peritoneal transport status associate less peritoneal fluid removal , overhydration , hypertension LVH . High peritoneal transport status risk factor mortality CAPD patient [ 7 ] . In recent year , increase focus association inflammation , increase oxidative stress high peritoneal transport rate relation mortality CAPD patient [ 8 ] . Inflammation show increase peritoneal transport rate CAPD patient [ 8 ] . Both inflammation increase oxidative stress may impact inadequate fluid removal . The exact mechanism phenomenon fully understood . Several experimental clinical study show increased oxidative stress dialysis patient may due inhibition nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis ADMA ( Asymmetric Dimethylarginine ) , know endogenous inhibitor NO synthetase [ 9 ] . ADMA may significantly reduce dialysis [ 10 ] . Metabolism ADMA primarily enzyme DDAH , activity decrease inflammation , oxidative stress , diabetes mellitus hypercholesterolemia [ 11 ] . It propose circulate ADMA may one mechanism accounting resistant hypertension fluid overload dialysis patient [ 11 ] . Based current knowledge , treatment aim reduce oxidative stress decrease ADMA level [ 11 ] , logical suggest therapy might improve BP control fluid status CAPD patient . In opinion , worth check ability antioxidant therapy produce favorable effect biological property peritoneal membrane . One preliminary study effect antioxidant Vitamin E show small beneficial effect ADMA chronic kidney disease [ 12 ] . N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) active antioxidant prove safe beneficial hemodialysis patent [ 13 ] . In recent study , NAC effectively reduce ototoxic effect gentamicin chronic hemodialysis patient [ 14 ] . The aim study investigate effect N-acetylcysteine peritoneal small solute clearance removal salt water prevalent CAPD patient .</detailed_description>
