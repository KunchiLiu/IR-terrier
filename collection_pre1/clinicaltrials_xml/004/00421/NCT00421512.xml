	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety bevacizumab sunitinib give combination kidney cancer . The drug act stop blood vessel growth different way . They study together previous study . We also want find effect ( good bad ) combination bevacizumab sunitinib tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Bevacizumab Sunitinib Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess maximum tolerate dose overall safety tolerability sunitinib administer combination bevacizumab treatment patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . To assess antitumor activity combination sunitinib bevacizumab . To evaluate serum level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) patient treat sunitinib bevacizumab . Study Design : This single center , open-label , Phase 1 study sunitinib combination bevacizumab patient advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma . This study design confirm two agent administer safely combination . Patients begin treatment bevacizumab Day 0 sunitinib Day 1 . Bevacizumab administer intravenously every two week . Sunitinib give orally 4 week , 2 week schedule . DLT determination base toxicity observe Cycles 1 - cycle define sunitinib dosing ( 6 week ) . Once MTD combination identify , 10 additional patient enrol MTD ass safety efficacy . Patients treat bevacizumab sunitinib disease progression , significant toxicity withdrawal patient consent . The maximum treatment duration 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm renal cell carcinoma ( histological subtype ) metastasis . Patients unresected primary tumor may enrol long evidence metastatic disease also present . Evidence unidimensionally measurable disease ( i.e. , great equal 1 malignant tumor mass accurately measure least 1 dimension great equal 20 mm conventional computerized tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan [ spiral CT scan use , minimum lesion size twice reconstruction interval use , e.g. , reconstruction size 7 mm , lesion size great equal 14 mm ] ) . Bone lesion , ascites , peritoneal carcinomatosis miliary lesion , pleural pericardial effusion , lymphangitis skin lung , cystic lesion , irradiate lesion consider measurable . Male female , 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Resolution acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgical procedure NCI CTCAE grade less equal 1 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL Total white blood cell count great equal 3000 cells/µL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/µL Platelets great equal 100,000/µL Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL Serum calcium less equal 12.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 x ULN PT less equal 1.5 ULN Urine protein : creatinine ratio less equal 1.0 screen Negative pregnancy test ( woman childbearing age ) Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients eligible high priority IRB protocol # 07066 Major surgery , open biopsy , traumatic injury , radiation systemic therapy within 4 week start study treatment . Anticipation major surgical procedure study . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . More 2 prior systemic therapy metastatic RCC . Minor surgical procedure fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 0 . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage within past 1 month . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior Day 0 . History known brain metastasis , current spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : severe/unstable angina , MI , CABG , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack peripheral vascular disease . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade great equal 2 , atrial fibrillation grade , prolongation QTc interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female . Blood pressure &gt; 150/90mmHg Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Current treatment another therapeutic clinical trial . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female patient must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female patient reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 7 day prior enrollment . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Receipt investigational agent within 4 week prior study entry . History severe hypersensitivity reaction bevacizumab component bevacizumab . Prior treatment sunitinib , bevacizumab Prior sorafenib give less 8 week prior study entry . Unresolved symptom sign related sorafenib within 8 week prior study entry . Use therapeutic dos coumadin . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure</criteria>
