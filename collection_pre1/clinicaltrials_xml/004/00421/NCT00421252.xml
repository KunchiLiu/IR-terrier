	<brief_summary>Patients stent place coronary artery require treatment least two medication prevent platelet stick stainless steel stent form blood clot result heart attack . The 2 anti-platelet medication use patient stent aspirin clopidogrel ( Plavix ) . These usually prescribe 1-12 month ( length time depend number type stent implant ) . Although typical long-term dose clopidogrel 75 mg mouth daily , large dose ( know load dose ) usually give start treatment help medication take effect quickly . Prior January 2006 , patient Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) undergo PCI already take clopidogrel would receive load dose 300-600 mg clopidogrel cardiac catheterization procedure room immediately angioplasty stenting portion procedure . However , several recent study suggest administer clopidogrel 600 mg least two hour prior angioplasty procedure reduce rate complication afterwards ( especially reduce chance detectable damage heart muscle ) . The main purpose study see whether give load dose clopidogrel 600 mg outpatient schedule undergo cardiac catheterization coronary angiography decrease risk procedure-related complication 14 day follow cardiac catheterization compare strategy give clopidogrel 600 mg procedure undergo angioplasty . We focus attention particularly detecting damage heart muscle follow angioplasty ( might expect improve load dose clopidogrel procedure ) bleed groin complication ( might worsen clopidogrel load procedure ) . The drug clopidogrel approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient recent ongoing heart attack , narrowing major blood vessel outside heart , recent stroke load dose 300 mg follow 75 mg daily . It use several large study load dose 600 mg without significant increase major adverse effect . However , yet know useful safe give load dose 600 mg cardiac catheterization outpatient stable symptom think midst heart attack .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY The benefit dual anti-platelet therapy full dose aspirin thienopyridine firmly establish patient undergo coronary stenting . Leon show reduction combine end-point death , myocardial infarction , target vessel revascularization stent thrombosis 3.5 % aspirin alone 2.3 % aspirin ticlopidine . This benefit associate , however , increased rate bleed vascular complication 5.5 % aspirin+ticlopidine versus 1.8 % aspirin alone . Multiple study evaluate safety efficacy thienopyridine clopidogrel percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . In patient intermediate risk ( without elevation troponin-T prior PCI ) , pretreatment clopidogrel several hour procedure reduce event rate obviate need additional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition ( ISAR-REACT ) . In Clopidogrel Reduction Events During Observation ( CREDO ) Study , investigator show benefit pretreatment 300 mg clopidogrel see pretreatment institute least 12 hour pre-procedure ( optimally 24 hour PCI ) . However , survival analysis study show cumulative event rate 30 day 8.3 % placebo arm , 7.8 % administer clopidogrel within 15 hour procedure , 3.5 % administer clopidogrel 15 hour index PCI . Subsequently , benefit high dose clopidogrel study ex vivo clinical study ( PRONTO ) . A 600 mg dose clopidogrel achieve adequate platelet inhibition within 2 hour administration , unlike 300 mg require least 3 6 hour achieve full effect Subsequent data ISAR-REACT investigator 2,159 patient show benefit 600 mg clopidogrel time dependent . The trial focus possible additional benefit glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition patient pre-treated 600 mg clopidogrel . More recently , ISAR-REACT-2 show clopidogrel pretreatment moderate high risk PCI patient reduce combined endpoint event rate ( relative placebo ) 11.7 % 5.7 % patient treat glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor 15.5 % 7.6 % receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition . The recently publish Assessment Best Loading Dose Clopidogrel Blunt Platelet Activation , Inflammation Ongoing Necrosis ( ALBION ) Trial show low risk group patient 600 mg 900 mg dos clopidogrel provide fast great platelet inhibition 300 mg assess biochemical assay . The study underpowered demonstrate clinical benefit , show trend towards reduction troponin-I release marker necrosis 58 % 42 % high dose clopidogrel group . There demonstrable increase major bleed complication ( 2.9 % 300 900 mg group ) , statistically insignificant increase minor bleed 900 mg dose group . Our investigation evaluate safety efficacy pre-treatment ( ≥2 hour ) 600 mg clopidogrel 600 outpatient undergoing elective cardiac catheterization coronary angiography institution evidence high risk feature ischemic ST segment deviation , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction , abnormal troponin-T level . The benefit clopidogrel patient undergo intervention may offset bleed complication encounter , especially patient undergo coronary angioplasty . Our trial design assess potential benefit-risk trade-off . Unlike ALBION trial , focus clinical outcome use large sample size . Our hypothesis pretreatment 600 mg clopidogrel significantly reduce incidence ischemic complication patient undergo PCI , possible increase hemorrhagic vascular complication overall population . In addition , also examine whether use 5 French arterial sheath case go onto intervention offset increase bleed risk , , associate pretreatment 600 mg clopidogrel . Very large diameter arterial sheath ( e.g. , 10 French ) associate high vascular complication rate , whether 5 French sheath offer low vascular complication rate 6 French sheath uncertain . Nearly PCIs institution perform use 6 French sheath ( large lumen , accommodate angioplasty equipment high injection rate iodinate contrast ) . Patients undergo PCI follow diagnostic angiography use 5 French sheath require exchange large 6 French arterial sheath . On hand , patient need angioplasty coronary angiography require exchange arterial sheath , small sheath size may well less vascular bleeding complication . DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL Design : This prospective randomized clinical trial compare ischemic , hemorrhagic vascular outcome outpatient undergo elective cardiac catheterization coronary angiography follow 1:1 randomization pretreatment 600 mg clopidogrel vs. pretreatment ( clopidogrel dose post-procedure PCI perform ) . Patients provide write informed consent prior enrollment randomization . Since operator may feel strongly use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition patient receive clopidogrel well advance PCI , blind load strategy use placebo feasible . A separate 1:1 randomization assign patient undergo cardiac catheterization use 5 6 French arterial introduce sheath . Since arterial sheath size color-coded , catheter size imprint catheter , operator must know arterial sheath size case alternate catheter require , blind sheath size assignment also feasible . The investigator adjudicate abstract outcome data bleed ischemic complication analysis blind , however , clopidogrel reimen randomization order avoid bias . Hypotheses test : The primary hypothesis examine clopidogrel 600 mg give ≥2 hour prior cardiac catheterization reduce frequency post-procedural ischemic event subset patient undergo ad hoc coronary intervention compare receive clopidogrel pre-procedure . The risk hemorrhagic vascular complication preloading strategy evaluate patient randomize ( encompass undergo PCI ) . Additional analysis perform see size initial arterial introducing sheath also effect rate hemorrhagic vascular complication interaction sheath size preloading strategy outcome . Patient population : All outpatient undergo elective cardiac catheterization plan coronary angiography possible ad hoc PCI ( lesion anatomy suitable ) receive clopidogrel ticlopidine 14 day prior procedure eligible . Patients high-risk clinical feature , contraindication clopidogrel , plan upcoming invasive procedure exclude ( vide infra ) . Procedural factor : The decision perform ad hoc PCI diagnostic coronary angiography ( vs. medical therapy bypass surgery ) make interventional cardiologist perform oversee cardiac catheterization , consultation patient 's clinical cardiologist . The specific angioplasty technique , device , equipment , anti-thrombin anti-platelet pharmacological regimen utilize NOT specify protocol discretion interventional cardiologist . Patients randomize 5 French arterial sheath NO clopidogrel preloading allow ambulate 2 hour arterial hemostasis achieve ( delay ambulation bleed orthostatic hypotension occur ) . All participant ( i.e. , 6 French arterial sheath , 5 French arterial sheath clopidogrel preloading ) allow ambulate earlier 4 hour hemostasis occur . Variables interest include baseline demographic clinical characteristic ( include age , gender , leave ventricular ejection fraction , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , dyslipidemia , chronic renal insufficiency , serum creatinine level , tobacco use , extent coronary disease , symptom severity , prior myocardial infarction , prior PCI , prior CABG ) , angiographic lesion characteristic ( e.g. , bifurcation location , lesion class ) , procedural factor ( e.g. , pharmacological antithrombin regimen , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use ) , post-procedural test ( include serum creatinine , serum creatine kinase MB isoform , troponin-T , radiological imaging study ) . Information glean Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database , electronic medical record , review procedural angiogram , conversation patient ( patient locate , family health care provider ) . Endpoints : All endpoint assess 14 day post-procedure ( divided analytical purpose in-hospital post-discharge event ) . See Endpoint section document detail . Follow-up : Written electronic medical record review identify clinical event occur hospitalization ( 1st 14 day post-procedure length stay prolong ) . Participants provide write informed consent clinical follow-up 14 day post-procedure prior entry study , contact information patient , his/her primary care provider , his/her cardiologist , his/her next kin collect discharge . The patient , his/her physician , his/her next kin contact telephone 14 day post-procedure asked patient treat discharge heart-related , bleeding , vascular access site problem ( i.e. , clinical event detail ) . If yes , attempt make , patient 's authorization , obtain information event , include request documentation health care facility provider . Data Monitoring Safety Plan : A independent data safety monitoring committee ( DSMC ) comprise Murray Mittleman , MD , DrPH ( BIDMC cardiovascular epidemiologist , serve Chair ) , David J. Cohen , MD , MSc ( interventional cardiologist Mid America Heart Institute ) , Shiva Gautam , PhD ( BIDMC biostatistician ) review rate 4 composite endpoint enumerate 14 day follow-up complete 1st 300 subject enrol . The DSMC advise principal investigator whether study terminate concern strike difference ischemic vascular/bleeding complication rate treatment strategy study allow continue plan enrollment 600 participant . Study recruitment suspend DSMC 's review deliberation . Data Management : Much data require study routinely collect part current clinical care , quality assurance regulatory process store Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database ( reside commercial application name Apollo manufacture Lumedx ) . The fields interest patient randomize study queried form Apollo database transfer directly Access database serve primary electronic data repository study . This database house network server within BIDMC firewall restrict access ( password valid user identification require ) . Additional information ( medical record patient contact ) collect paper case report form prior entry Access database . All case report form paper clinical information patient identifier store lock file drawer within locked office . Angiograms review use clinical workstation physically secure area , electronic copy angiogram make patient identifier electronically remove . Medical record number names remove prior creation final analytical dataset . All paper electronic information destroy HIPAA-compliant fashion completion publication study . Statistical Considerations Randomization : A randomization scheme prepare use 1:1:1:1 ratio ( 2 clopidogrel dose strategy combine independently 5 vs. 6 French arterial sheath ) permute block random size 4 8 . The treatment assignment designate opaque , tamper-resistant randomization envelope provide Statistical Department Harvard Clinical Research Institute . Statistical Analysis : All statistical analysis perform use SAS Windows v9 . The primary analysis compare cumulative incidence 14 day primary composite endpoint ( death , myocardial infarction , myocardial necrosis ) patient PCI attempt randomized clopidogrel load vs. randomize standard clopidogrel administration use Fisher 's exact test . A p value 0.05 less required statistical significance . The secondary endpoint stent thrombosis among undergo stent deployment also evaluate use Fisher 's exact test . The endpoint ( include vascular bleeding ) examine patient randomize ( subset PCI attempt stent deploy ) . Two group comparison ( clopidogrel load vs. standard dosing ; 5 French vs. 6 French arterial sheath ) 4 group comparison ( 4 combination clopidogrel dose strategy arterial sheath size ; subgroup PCI PCI clopidogrel dose strategy ) perform use Fisher 's exact test , t-tests , ANOVA , analogous non-parametric test appropriate . Since multiple exploratory analysis perform , p-values everything primary analysis delineate must interpret caution . Logistical regression model also construct identify pre-procedural predictor ischemic bleed vascular complication .</detailed_description>
