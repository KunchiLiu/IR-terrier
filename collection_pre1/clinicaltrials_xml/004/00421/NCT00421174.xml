	<brief_title>Effectiveness Etanercept Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome Following Stem Cell Transplantation ( BMT CTN 0403 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over last two decade , allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) emerge important treatment number malignant non-malignant disorder . Unfortunately , several complication , include graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) pulmonary dysfunction , limit utility aggressive form therapy . Infectious non-infectious lung complication occur 25 % 55 % HCT recipients account 50 % transplant-related mortality . In half affected patient , infectious organism identify lung . Two major type non-infectious pulmonary injury recognize : acute idiopathic pneumonia syndrome ( IPS ) sub-acute lung injury ( obstructive airway disease bronchiolitis obliterans [ BrOb ] restrictive lung disease ) . The current study examine use etanercept patient IPS . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Eligible patient randomize receive one two arm therapy : ( A ) etanercept plus corticosteroid , ( B ) placebo plus corticosteroid . Patients receive total eight dos etanercept ( placebo ) 4-week period . The initial dose etanercept ( placebo ) administer intravenously Day 0 , subsequent dos administer subcutaneously ( SQ ) . Dosing administered twice weekly 4 consecutive week . The placebo inert diluent use etanercept formulation . Additionally , patient arm receive corticosteroid ( 2 mg/kg/day ) Day 0 Day 7 , subsequent taper clinically indicate . Chest radiograph shall obtain weekly Day 28 . Plasma cytokine profile obtain Days 0 , 7 , 28 . For patient &lt; 30 day post-transplant : If patient 's clinical condition broncho-alveolar lavage ( BAL ) deem `` possible performed '' treat physician ( pulmonologist ) , `` study '' BAL may waive . In circumstance , patient may register randomize study therapy without BAL undertaken . For patient mechanical ventilation : If BAL do , appropriate virology study nasal swab ( nasal wash ) require minimum procedure study entry . For patient mechanical ventilation : Microbiologic study deep endotracheal aspirate allow lieu formal bronchoscopy procedure . However , protocol-specified biologic study ( see Section 4.4 ) do specimen . For patient 31-180 day post-transplant : An `` study '' bronchoscopy require case . If , point follow initiation study drug therapy , previously obtain BAL fluid culture BAL fluid analysis become positive infectious pathogen , study drug therapy shall discontinue point , re-instituted . The patient discontinue study drug therapy , still follow outcome . The primary study endpoint response Day 28 . Patients discontinue study drug therapy reason still follow primary secondary study endpoint .</detailed_description>
