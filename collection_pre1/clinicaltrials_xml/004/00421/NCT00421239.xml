	<brief_title>Risk Factors Hypertensive Urgencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spectrum disorder associate arterial hypertension ( AH ) encompass chronic uncomplicated hypertension hypertensive crisis , include hypertensive urgences emergency . Hypertensive crisis account 25 % patient visit medical section emergency department , hypertensive urgences ( HU ) account two-third case . Hypertensive crisis , without prompt treatment , often associate morbidity mortality . We propose conduct population-based case-control study HU area Russian Federation . We include thirty study center one data coordinating center recruit study participant period one year . We plan conduct in-person interview 1,500 case 1,500 control elicit information demographic background history exposure . We intend test 20-25 risk factor HU thus calculate target number subject 3000 pt . We ` go get access hospital list study center . From database ` select patient AH recruit every third participant come hospital or/and policlinic . Every select participant ask respond question phone divide two group . Participants HU two week call questioned level arterial pressure treatment HU . Participants often HU ( every week ) include first group ( prevalent case , group A ) . Participants seldom HU ( every month less ) include second group ( control , group B ) . Cases control select population AH patient . Questionnaire contain information age , gender , tobacco use , data HU ( frequency , treatment complication ) , antihypertensive concomitant treatment , level blood pressure , regularity take antihypertensive drug , associate clinical condition ( cerebrovascular disease , heart disease , renal disease , peripheral vascular disease ) , PCI , CABG , possible intend collect information factor influence prognosis ( fast plasma glucose , dyslipidaemia , serum creatinine , serum uric acid , leave ventricular hypertrophy ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Cases : every third patient hospital/policlinic database diagnose arterial hypertension ( SBP/DBP &gt; 140/90 Hg take anti hypertensive drug ) frequent ( weekly daily ) hypertensive urgency ( SBP/DBPâ‰¥180/110 Hg ) potentially eligible study . Controls select population participant random telephone dialing every third patient arterial hypertension ( SBP/DBP &gt; 140/90 Hg take anti hypertensive drug ) seldom ( monthly , several time year never ) hypertensive urgency .
