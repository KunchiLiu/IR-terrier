	<detailed_description>Global challenge tuberculosis ( TB ) control multidrug resistance TB ( MDR-TB ) increase susceptibility population elderly , HIV infection , type 2 diabetes immunosuppressive chronic disease . The first primary study objective examine potential investigator ' new DNA extraction/qPCR protocol non-invasive tool study pathogenesis range paucibacillary specimen . The investigator evaluate DNA extraction/qPCR assay prospectively specimens patient paucibacillary TB , include extra-pulmonary TB ( EPTB ) smear-negative pulmonary TB . Investigators determine number mycobacterial genome , presence intact mycobacteria , precise location within plasma , PBMCs PMNs blood , fluid cell range specimen . The second primary study objective standardize validate qPCR assay early detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) drug resistance directly specimens . The investigator establish feasibility use highly sensitive assay determine ratio Rifampin ( RIF ) -resistant RIF-susceptible bacteria give specimen . The investigator adapt simple effective method , similar qPCR technology , detection mutation rpoB gene . MTB-positive specimen , identify either qPCR direct smear , screen RIF resistance use molecular beacon probe qPCR . The concordance molecular beacon-qPCR assay resistance phenotype culture establish . The investigator utilize capacity qPCR quantitate ratio RIF-resistant -sensitive mycobacteria clinical specimen . The investigator hypothesize current assay limit indicate `` presence '' drug susceptibility patient situation complex , dynamic mixture resistant sensitive bacteria , depend local exposure drug . Developing tool detects minor population drug-resistance cell open new avenue investigation help understand development resistance treatment failure . Primary study outcome include : anticipation qPCR blood WBCs provide substantially improve sensitivity precision ( mycobacterial specie information ) diagnosis paucibacillary TB , specifically tuberculous lymphadenitis , pleural TB smear-negative ( early ) pulmonary TB , compare standard microbiological clinical diagnosis ; anticipation molecular beacon-qPCR predict RIF-resistance 100 % sensitivity least 86 % sensitivity study site , provide new tool early suspicion MDR , hence , prompt modification treatment schedule patient ; investigator learn biology emergence RIF resistance population mycobacteria serial patient specimen . Specimens collect patient 3 site , predominantly Hispanic population , locate South Texas , adjacent northeast Mexico , Colombia . A maximum 780 male female , age 18-85 year , recruit . The study population consist 390 people tuberculosis ( 62 TB lymphadenitis , 164 pleural TB 164 smear-negative pulmonary TB ) 390 control ( either healthy control disease initially think one three form TB described case , rule ) . Subjects 1 study relate visit . Patients contact , invited participate interview begin evaluation possible TB . The study team follow-up health department determine patient indeed diagnose TB , laboratory determine result serial direct smear , culture sensitivity diagnosis course treatment .</detailed_description>
