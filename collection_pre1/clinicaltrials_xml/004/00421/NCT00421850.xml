	<brief_summary>The cost diabetes care ( health care dollar &amp; human suffering ) United States second mental illness . Randomized control trial &amp; observational study show glycemic control predictive onset &amp; severity complication diabetes cost care . In addition , significant percentage cost associate diabetes reduce delayed appropriate diagnosis , preventive strategy , &amp; management . The Planned Care Model ( advocate Institute Healthcare Improvement ) show success demonstrate improved practice performance patient outcomes limited pilot clinical practice . We propose generalize Planned Care Model , assess value plan care people diabetes . The Planned Care Model implement practice site consist structured communication schema patient primary health care team , improve care people diabetes . Traditional care define traditional system care patient prior participation Planned Care Model . It hypothesize Planned Care Model improve compliance appropriate care guideline improve short long term health outcome ( metabolic , satisfaction , morbidity , mortality healthcare utilization ) . In conjunction study , provider practice site randomly assign structure communication specialty care , refer UNITED Planned Care ( Use Networks , Informatics , Telemedicine , Education Disease Management ) . This communication schema possible assign provider ? patient participate Planned Care Model . The UNITED Planned Care model include point-of-care evidence base message specialty advice determine performance gap outcomes patient . UNITED Planned Care hypothesize great impact short &amp; long term health outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The problem : The quality diabetes care highly variable , patient receive sub-optimal care . Best practice ideally describe research finding . Most provider aware research finding . Traditional continue medical education ( CME ) dissemination practice guideline fail reduce variation around best practice . A proposed solution : We hypothesize practitioner receive evidence-based information address specific deficiency practice , timely fashion point-of-care , likely improve quality diabetes care . To test hypothesis suggest follow randomize controlled trial . Randomized trial Participants : Primary care team Intervention : ( UNITED PLANNED CARE MODEL ) In set Planned Care Model , provider team assign intervention , Diabetes Electronic Management System produce individualized performance report health care team . Specific performance gap identify trigger two action : 1 ) Specific message forward team address performance gap . 2 ) A diabetologist provide counsel support specific deficiency . ( e.g . base performance report generate DEMS , individual provider patient performance gap LDL cholesterol &gt; 150 medication , would get specific evidence base message goal LDL cholesterol patient diabetes , &amp; support/suggestions specialist ) Control ( USUAL PLANNED CARE ) In set Planned Care Model , provider team will receive periodic information cardiovascular risk reduction diabetes specific patient ? performance gap . These team access specialist use usual referral channel . None source respond practitioner ? performance gap . There proactive support suggestion specialist . Outcomes : 1 ) Processes ( .e.g. , frequency lipid profile measurement ) ; 2 ) Patient metabolic outcome ( .e.g. , % patient practice LDL concentration &lt; 100 mg/dL ) ; 3 ) Patient-centered outcome ( e.g. , % patient suffer atherosclerotic event ) ; 4 ) CQI process cost-effectiveness . Significance : A . Implement Planned Care model least 3 primary care sit Rochester-Kasson B . Pilot Implement structure specialty communication link point care evidence base message support CME telecommunication link include DEMS . C. Measure patient satisfaction care delivery D. Measure provider health care team satisfaction care delivery E. Measure metabolic outcome patient participate project F. Measure demographics co-morbidities patient participate project G. Audit performance metric , patient outcomes yearly intervention complete statistical assessment keep primary hypothesis project H. Provision anonymized patient data support assessment outcome study</detailed_description>
