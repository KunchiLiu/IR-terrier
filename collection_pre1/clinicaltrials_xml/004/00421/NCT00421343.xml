	<brief_title>Secondary Prevention Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following fracture , person screen treated osteoporosis ( Feldstein et al ) . It surprising , , risk future osteoporotic fracture remain high . Although little data exists secondary prevention osteoporosis , calcium , vitamin D , bisphosphonates show effective primary prevention osteoporotic fracture , likely beneficial reduce secondary fracture well . Targeting falls prevention another approach likely effective reduce risk fracture . In U.S. , acute rehabilitation ( rehab ) setting offer unique environment initiate osteoporotic therapy . Therefore , study develop implement evidence base intervention secondary prevention osteoporotic fracture acute rehab set follow objective : Specific Aim I : Assess overall compliance pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention initiate acute rehab set follow fragility fracture . Hypothesis : Non-compliant participant less likely show improvement functional status , muscle strength , vitamin D level follow intervention . Specific Aim II : Describe incidence fragility fracture fall participant 6-months one-year follow osteoporotic intervention introduce acute rehab . Hypothesis : Similar community base study , number participant go experience repeat fall result fracture within one-year follow-up . Compliant participant less likely experience fall fracture . Specific Aim III : Confirm high prevalence vitamin D deficiency rehab set . Describe relationship change vitamin D level participant baseline 6-month follow-up change functional outcome . Hypothesis : There direct association change vitamin D level change functional status . Consecutive individual admit primary secondary diagnosis fracture rehabilitation unit Hebrew Rehabilitation Center offer enrollment . All participant enrol receive intervention : calcium , vitamin D , weekly oral bisphosphonate , fall prevention intervention . Specific intervention prevent fall include optimization visual acuity , review medication associate fall , personalize exercise improve strength balance , home hazard safety evaluation indicate . All participant functional status , muscle strength , vitamin D level measure baseline rehab stay . At six-month follow-up , home visit perform participant assess functional status , muscle strength , vitamin D level , satisfaction intervention , reason non-compliance . A history interim fall fracture collect telephone interview , home nursing visit , exit 6-month visit .</detailed_description>
