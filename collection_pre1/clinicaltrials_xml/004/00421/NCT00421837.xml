	<brief_summary>Influenza ( flu ) lead cause respiratory ( breathe ) illness lead sickness death winter month . A good understanding certain people get flu get sicker flu people important develop improved vaccine treatment . This study look genetic makeup ( determine person 's specific characteristic trait ) 50 patient , old 50 , hospitalize flu Vanderbilt University 2006-2007 flu season . Their genetic makeup compare genetic makeup 50 people related close daily contact flu patient infect flu virus . The study staff collect blood sample ( contain genetic material ) participant ( flu patient contact ) comparison . Flu patient complete health survey part previous study , contact complete short version survey .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza lead vaccine preventable cause respiratory illness lead substantial morbidity mortality winter month . It define rapid-onset systemic illness , patient present fever , chill , cough , myalgia , headache sore throat . Given huge health burden cause influenza ever present threat future pandemic , good understand population genetic variation association severe outcomes influenza infection critical develop improved vaccine treatment entire population risk person . This study single-center , specimen collection pilot protocol design compare genotype patient , age great 50 year , hospitalize respiratory symptom fever Vanderbilt University culture PCR confirm influenza virus infection individual relate close daily contact subject infect influenza virus 2006 - 2007 influenza season . This study link DMID protocol 06-0051 . All subject recruit subject enrol Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) parent study 06-0051 , Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Units ( VTEU ) -funded respiratory disease surveillance study conduct 2006 - 2007 influenza season . If subject complete surveillance parent study , ( DMID study 06-0051 ) , he/she must agree contacted future study surveillance consent prior enrollment sub-study . Controls study recruit via index case . This study enroll 100 subject total , 50 study subject 50 control subject . The 50 study subject include individual hospitalize respiratory symptom fever infect influenza virus . The 50 control subject uninfected , non-related individual live household close daily contact subject . The study staff obtain 15 ml venous blood sample subject genotyping study . Subjects complete health assessment part parent trial control ask short version survey include item : demographic , chronic disease history , history immunosuppressive drug condition , vaccination history , smoke history , living condition . The primary objective study conduct whole genome array analysis individual confirm influenza virus infection compare genotype individual likely expose influenza due close daily contact , genetically relate .</detailed_description>
