	<brief_title>Testosterone Therapy Men With Low Testosterone Levels Metabolic Syndrome Early Stages Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The metabolic syndrome constitutes cluster risk factor cardiovascular disease increase morbidity mortality . In essence metabolic syndrome refer concomitant occurrence hypertension , hyperlipidemia , impair glucose tolerance insulin resistance abdominal obesity . The presence abdominal obesity seem key factor development metabolic derangement occur part different definition currently use diagnostic criterion 's metabolic syndrome . A number study verify serious prognosis male ( female ) present abdominal obesity . The term metabolic syndrome alludes common mechanism behind development different sings condition far etiological interrelationship know . In male metabolic syndrome low serum testosterone level common find data longitudinal study suggest low testosterone level precede development abdominal obesity seem facilitate later development hypertension , hyperlipidemia hyperglycemia . A small study test hypothesis testosterone therapy may beneficial metabolic effect male metabolic syndrome implicate low testosterone level part disease facilitate factor male . Current study The current study `` ARTinMMS '' interventional phase IV study male ( 30-70 year inclusive ) early stage metabolic syndrome define abdominal obesity , glucose intolerance overt type 2 diabetes define accord criterion 's suggested International Federation Diabetes . The study 24 week randomize placebo control parallel group multi-centre study male serum testosterone level 12 nmol/L treat testosterone/placebo ( total duration study include follow-up visit 26-27 week ) . The primary endpoint study assessment insulin sensitivity measurement fast plasma glucose insulin level calculate accord QUICKI formula . In addition glucose tolerance test standard oral glucose tolerance test well assessment blood lipid blood pressure . A total 176 male recruit randomized study screen procedure verify eligibility study . Males participate must fulfil series inclusion exclusion criterion , addition metabolic syndrome low testosterone level require HbA1c level 7,5 % , stable blood pressure control cholesterol level 8 mmol/L . Medical treatment condition accept diabetes treatment limited metformin . Before enter study study male follow blood test glucose tolerance assessment physical examination . In study require five clinical visit , Base-line observation randomization visit , two visit treatment phase ( 12 23 week therapy ) follow-up visit cessation therapy . A exploratory variable ass marker change cholesterol metabolism , adiponectin subject study characterize genotype analysis CAG repeat polymorphism androgen receptor . A subset patient examine CT abdomen assess eventual change intra abdominal fat mass liver attenuation . Safety procedure involve assessment prostate ( digital rectal examination PSA level ) Hb level baseline throughout study . Study medication Males enrol study treat daily application 7,5 g 1 % testosterone hydroalcoholic gel ( 75 mg testosterone apply specified skin site ) placebo gel . Time plan The study plan start q2 2007 12 different centre , Austria , Germany Sweden . Each centre anticipate recruit 10 -30 subject 2 month period . To facilitate recruitment newspaper advertising web base eligibility screen use feasible . After 1-3 week screen period eligible subject randomize active placebo therapy . Two evaluation make treatment phase first 12 second 24 week . Efficacy safety assessment perform visit . Competitive enrolment use first six week recruitment period enable centre recruit up-front agreed number subject . Data capture laboratory routine A centralize internet base system use data capturing , communication study staff automatic entry laboratory data . All laboratory analysis perform core laboratory ( LFK Kiel ) . A paper CRF use primary entry patient data subsequently transcribe electronic CRF . All study centre train investigator meet management data capturing system</detailed_description>
