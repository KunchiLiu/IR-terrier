	<brief_summary>This study test whether botulinum toxin ( Botox ) may relieve uncomfortable sensation patient restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) experience . RLS common movement disorder cause sensory discomfort restlessness , often legs , improve movement . Although medication available treat disorder , many people experience side effect prevent continue medication . The Food Drug Administration approve Botox movement disorder cosmetic us . People 18 year age old moderate severe RLS take RLS medication 6 week enter study may eligible participate . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , blood test , woman become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . Participants randomly assign receive injection either Botox placebo ( salt water ) nine area legs . The correct location muscle inject determined electromyography ( EMG ) , test measure electrical activity muscle . For surface EMG , electrode ( small metal disk ) fill conductive gel tap skin . Needle EMG involve insert needle muscle . Both method use study . At 2 4 week injection , subject interview telephone ask describe symptom , side effect improvement may notice . After 12 week return NIH injection alternate compound ; , receive Botox previously give placebo second set injection , vice-versa . Subjects contact telephone 2 4 week injection report symptom , side effect benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To evaluate efficacy botulinum toxin type A , ( BoNT ) treatment primary Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) . We hypothesize BoNT effective decrease deep sensory discomfort RLS . STUDY POPULATION : This protocol proof principle double-blind randomized placebo-BoNT crossover outpatient pilot study 6 patient diagnosed moderate severe primary RLS . DESIGN : All subject evaluate NIH Clinical Center study investigator determine eligibility participation protocol . We obtain complete medical history , perform neurological examination , along laboratory screen study . Subjects eligible participate receive baseline rating use Restless Legs Rating Scale ( RLS-RS ) . Subjects randomize receive electromyography ( EMG ) -guided injection 90 unit BoNT equivalent volume saline low extremity , symptomatic muscle . Subjects receive follow rating week 2 4 follow injection . Twelve week receive first injection , subject crossover receive alternative compound similar follow rating . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure mean change baseline 4 week post-injection RLS-RS placebo BoNT , pre specify outcome evaluate patient report Clinical Global Impression Change ( CGI-C ) score group , duration effect , adverse event . Only descriptive statistic perform limited data sample .</detailed_description>
