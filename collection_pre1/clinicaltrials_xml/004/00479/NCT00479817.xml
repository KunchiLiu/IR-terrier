	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To estimate treatment effect measure progression free survival ( PFS ) subject recurrent ovarian cancer receive AMG 386 ( either 3 mg/kg 10 mg/kg IV QW ) combination paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 IV QW ; 3 on/1 ) compare subject receive paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 IV QW ; 3 on/1 ) plus placebo Secondary Objective ( ) : - To evaluate safety tolerability combination regimen AMG 386/paclitaxel - To estimate measure treatment effect ( parameter PFS ) subject receive AMG 386 combination paclitaxel compare subject receive paclitaxel plus placebo - To evaluate AMG 386 pharmacokinetics parameter ( Cmax Cmin ) administer paclitaxel subject recurrent ovarian cancer - To estimate incidence occurrence anti-AMG 386 antibody formation - To estimate change duration change blood level CA-125 - To evaluate clinical benefit among subject receive AMG 386 10 mg/kg monotherapy disease progression paclitaxel - To estimate impact AMG 386 patient report ovarian cancer specific symptom HRQoL use FACT-O , FACT-O ovarian cancer subscale ( OCS ) , FACT-O 3-item ( O1 , O2 , O3 ) cancer symptom specific subscale ( OCS 3-item subscale ) Exploratory Objective ( ) : - To explore association progression free survival , objective response , CA-125 , continuous measure tumor burden ( percentage change baseline sum long diameter target lesion ) - To explore pharmacodynamic ( PD ) response assess change blood level angiogenic cytokine , tumor apoptosis , CA-125 marker - To investigate effect genetic variation drug metabolism , cancer gene drug target gene ovarian cancer subject response investigational product ( separate inform consent ) - To explore impact AMG 386 patient report overall health status measure EuroQoL ( EQ-5D ) Hypothesis : This study provide estimate correspond 2-sided 80 % confidence interval approximate maximum half-width 0.22 efficacy , measure PFS hazard ratio AMG 386 combination paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone 2 pool dose group AMG 386 ( 10 mg/kg QW 3 mg/kg QW ) combination paclitaxel versus paclitaxel plus placebo group .</detailed_description>
