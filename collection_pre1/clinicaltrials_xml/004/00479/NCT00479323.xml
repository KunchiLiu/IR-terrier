	<detailed_description>Serum 89SF pool serum individual vaccinate 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine collect late 1980s . The 89SF standard ELISA run low ( 2-3 year supply ) insufficient serve opsinophagocytosis assay ( OPA ) , require large volume . The objective study immunize healthy volunteer license polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( Pneumovax 23 ) subsequent blood donation quantity sufficient make reference serum . Two hundred fifty volunteer subject recruit total population 600 . Study participant include healthy men nonpregnant female , age 18-45 . Subjects undergo physical examination license clinician , subject interview , clinical laboratory serologic testing . Potential subject must provide write informed consent meet eligibility criterion . On Day 0 , subject receive 0.5 mL pneumococcal vaccine ( Pneumovax 23 ) deltoid muscle .
