	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether experimental drug call AMD3100 use combination another medication call G-CSF safe help increase amount blood stem cell ( call CD34+ stem cell ) find peripheral blood patient Fanconi anemia . While AMD3100 use successfully adult volunteer cancer patient , use child patient Fanconi anemia child cancer . Fanconi anemia rare genetic disease . Most Fanconi anemia patient eventually develop bone marrow failure , condition bone marrow long produce red blood cell ( carry oxygen ) , white blood cell ( fight infection ) , platelet ( help blood clot ) . The successful treatment patient Fanconi anemia bone marrow failure bone marrow transplantation . However , treatment many risk available patient Fanconi anemia . CD34+ cell include stem cell find bone marrow peripheral blood capable make red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . CD34+ stem cell collect bone marrow peripheral blood purify use experimental device call CliniMACS . However , Fanconi anemia patient enough CD34+ stem cell bone marrow peripheral blood collect use standard method work well child adults n't Fanconi anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobilization Collection Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Patients With Fanconi Anemia Using G-CSF AMD3100</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fanconi anemia rare autosomal recessive syndrome comprise progressive bone marrow failure , congenital anomaly predisposition malignancy . The heterozygote rate United States may high 1 300 . The mean age onset aplastic anemia approximately eight year . Although improved supportive care prolong survival patient year diagnosis bone marrow failure , mean age death still approximately 24 year age . Most patient die complication bone marrow failure include bleeding , infection , malignancy complication stem cell transplantation . In recent 20 year review patient Fanconi anemia registry , actual risk develop leukemia cancer approximately 30 % . The diagnosis Fanconi anemia initially rest upon find combination bone marrow failure congenital anomaly . These anomaly include cafe au lait spot and/or hypo pigmentation skin , short stature , upper limb malformation ( often involve thumb radius ) , renal gastrointestinal abnormality , microcephaly , characteristic facies broad nasal base , epicanthal fold , narrow set small eye micrognathia . The bone marrow failure characterize slow progression severe bone marrow aplasia pancytopenia , stress erythropoiesis fetal feature include macrocytosis , elevate hemoglobin F , antigen expression . Attempts culture bone marrow progenitor vitro patient Fanconi anemia demonstrate decreased number myeloid erythroid colony ( CFU ) consistent clinical bone marrow failure . Fanconi anemia cell appear defect DNA repair lead increase spontaneous chromosomal breakage . This feature increase susceptibility Fanconi anemia cell DNA bifunctional cross-linking agent mitomycin C diepoxybutane ( DEB ) . The diagnosis Fanconi anemia relies upon detect increase chromosomal breakage vitro treatment DEB . 11 Similarly , cell culture patient Fanconi anemia display increase susceptibility cytotoxicity mitomycin C. More recently , cell patient Fanconi anemia demonstrate display G2 phase prolongation/arrest , increased sensitivity toxicity oxygen , defective p53 induction increase apoptosis . Fanconi anemia classify least thirteen complementation group somatic cell hybrid . The complementation base upon correction chromosomal sensitivity cross-linking agent hybrid cell . Twelve independent gene clone characterize within 13 complementation group . A loss function gene include FANC A , B , C , D2 , E , F , G , J , L , M , N , FANC D1 ( BRCA2 ) cause Fanconi anemia . However , complementation group A , C , G account approximately 80-85 % patient Fanconi anemia United States . Discrete mutation gene identify family disorder . Expression complementary cDNA gene respective Fanconi anemia cell vitro corrects increase chromosomal breakage DEB increase sensitivity mitomycin C. Expression gene product bone marrow progenitor patient Fanconi anemia increase survival vitro assay . The current treatment Fanconi anemia relies upon hematological support form red blood cell platelet transfusion . Aplastic anemia transiently respond androgen therapy 50 % child . G-CSF also utilize publish study group improve number myeloid cell peripheral circulation . Bone marrow transplantation cure patient bone marrow failure ; however , appear toxicity condition regimen may increase number solid tumor post transplant compare patient without disorder . Survival five year match sibling transplant exceed 65 % unrelated donor transplant 30 % . More recent study unrelated donor transplant Fanconi anemia Cincinnati Children 's Hospital University Minnesota report survival rate approach observe matched sibling donor transplant . However , graft failure result death remain major obstacle . The availability sufficient number ( previously purify cryopreserved ) autologous HSC re-infusion graft failure may prevent complication . Finally , gene therapy approach pursue , date , evidence cure approach human , although correction report murine model . These study hamper fact mouse knockouts FA gene develop spontaneous aplastic anemia thus phenocopies human disease . Thus previously report mouse-studies , gene therapy approach require ablative total body irradiation recipient mouse ensure engraftment gene correct stem cell . An obvious limitation Fanconi anemia hematopoietic stem cell gene transfer necessary target genetic manipulation , hematopoietic stem cell ( surrogate , CD34+ cell ) progressively lose development aplastic anemia . Thus time severe aplasia great need treatment , target stem cell genetic modification deficient . Collection meaningful number HSC prior onset aplastic anemia eventual use therapeutic gene therapy trial explore study outline . Key question remain whether correct HSC Fanconi anemia patient engraft autologous re-infusion without cyto-reductive treatment recipient , engraft , whether correct cell demonstrate proliferative advantage uncorrected stem cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must diagnosis Fanconi anemia confirm positive test increase chromosomal breakage mitomycin C diepoxybutane peripheral blood , bone marrow amniotic fluid . 2 . Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate cellularity ( mononuclear cell per ml bone marrow obtain ) , CD34+ content ( % MNC ) , normal cytogenetics within three month collection . 3 .
