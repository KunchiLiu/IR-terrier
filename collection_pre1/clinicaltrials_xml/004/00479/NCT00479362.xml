	<brief_summary>There establish guideline regard interruption warfarin anticoagulant therapy prior surgical implantation cardiac pacemaker . Continuing anticoagulant could potentially result increased bleeding complication implantation surgery , whereas discontinue anticoagulant could predispose patient blood clot stroke . In study intend randomly assign warfarin-treated patient either interrupted continue warfarin therapy prior pacemaker implantation purpose establish rate complication group . Our hypothesis cardiac pace device safely implant without discontinuation anticoagulant therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anticoagulant Therapy During Pacemaker Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite greatly increase utilization pacemaker internal cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy various indication recent year , relatively publish study bleed complication associate implantation device . The purpose study assess incidence severity hemorrhagic complication result pacemaker ICD implantation patient treat oral anticoagulant warfarin acetyl salicylic acid . There unified guideline regard warfarin use pacemaker implantation . A case case approach commonly employ regard whether interrupt continue anticoagulant therapy prior procedure . Interrupting therapy may expose patient thromboembolic complication , whereas continue increase risk perioperative bleeding . Thus , either approach could potentially increase patient morbidity prolong hospital stay . Therefore , evidence base choice appropriate approach prepare anticoagulant-treated patient pacemaker implantation could significant impact patient safety over-all procedural cost . We intend assess rate hemorrhagic thrombotic complication well length hospital stay associate pacemaker ICD implantation patient randomize either continue interrupt warfarin treatment . One control group form pacemaker-receiving patient acetyl salicylic acid well one group patient medication affect coagulation system thrombocyte aggregation . Potential risk factor bleed thromboembolic complication search . A total 400 patient recruit multicenter study conduct five hospital Finland . Warfarin user ( n=200 ) randomly allocate two group : A. uninterrupted warfarin therapy maintain accepted intensity ( INR 2 3 ) , B. interruption warfarin 2 day prior device implantation . Control group comprise described one hundred patient . The end-points study : occurrence major bleeding , haemorrhages hematomas pacemaker pocket , utilization adjunctive therapy control bleeding ( e.g . Vitamin K Fresh frozen plasma ) , need surgical wound revision thromboembolic complication . The duration hospital stay also record . At two centre ( Turku University Hospital Satakunta Central Hospital ) patient also randomly assign two group implantation procedure either guide venous angiography . Patients willing participate study receive verbal write information study ask sign inform consent . All device implant normal fashion accord generally accept clinical guideline . A variety clinical laboratory variable record study group identify risk factor bleed thromboembolism . The aim study establish among patient implanted pacemaker ( 1 ) whether uninterrupted warfarin therapy increase rate severity bleed complication , ( 2 ) whether interruption warfarin result increase thromboembolic event , ( 3 ) whether aspirin treatment increase bleed complication compare , also seek identify factor predispose haemorrhagic complication . Our main hypothesis cardiac pace device safely implant without discontinuation anticoagulant therapy .</detailed_description>
