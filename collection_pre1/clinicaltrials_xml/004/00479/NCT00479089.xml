	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To compare proportion patient free progression 9 month start consolidation therapy combination docetaxel ZD1839 ( Iressa ) versus docetaxel alone . For purpose protocol , `` consolidation '' therapy refers treatment give time maximal benefit conventional front-line multi-agent chemotherapy . Secondary Objective : 1 . To compare time progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) cause-specific survival ( CSS ) two arm . For completeness , report initiation consolidation chemotherapy , completion induction chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Docetaxel drug design help stop cancer cell grow divide . ZD1839 also drug design block cancer cell grow divide . Before treatment start , complete physical exam . Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine test take part usual evaluation liver , bone marrow , blood clotting ability , kidney function . A chest x-ray ECG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) do . You image study CT scan chest abdomen pelvis bone scan show location current tumor . If need , MRI scan brain do . This evaluation consider standard . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Patients history invasive tumor bladder , prior cystoscopy , must screen cystoscopy EUA ( examination anesthesia ) , check extent disease bladder . An EUA bladder standard procedure diagnose check status bladder cancer . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . Participants one group receive docetaxel alone . Participants group receive docetaxel plus ZD1839 . There equal chance assign either group . Both study doctor know group assign . Docetaxel give catheter ( plastic tube ) place large vein chest arm . The medication give thirty minute one day week 4 week . This follow 2 week break . The 4 week treatment 2 week without treatment consider one course ( 6 week ) . Dexamethasone give decrease risk allergic reaction docetaxel . In first cycle , receive 3 dos dexamethasone mouth every 12 hour start night docetaxel infusion . If reaction , dexamethasone decrease Course 2 one dose twice day therapy . If reaction Course 2 , dexamethasone decrease 1 dose 1 hour docetaxel treatment . ZD1839 medication take mouth every day without break . Participants docetaxel plus ZD1839 group take one ZD1839 tablet day time . You take ZD1839 without food . If forget take dose , take last miss dose soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due . If less 12 hour next dose , take dose miss . During treatment , weekly blood test ( 2-3 tablespoon ) measure bone marrow function . A physical exam blood test ( 2-3 tablespoon ) repeat cycle treatment . Imaging study repeat 9 month may perform sooner symptom show tumor may get bad . These scan consider part standard routine follow-up . You study long tumor grow certain rate severe side effect . Therapy stop may take study early one thing occur . After 6 month , patient choose continue therapy wish . At end 4 cycle , option continue assign therapy long tolerate evidence disease get bad . There maximum amount time receive treatment study . After study complete , follow-up arrange discretion treat physician . This investigational study . The FDA authorize ZD1839 research use . A total 90 patient may take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must histologic demonstration metastatic locally unresectable transitional cell carcinoma urothelium . Minor component ( &lt; 50 % overall ) variant glandular squamous differentiation , evolution aggressive phenotype sarcomatoid small cell change acceptable . However , atypical histology dominant , treatment approach may appropriate , patient eligible . All patient must demonstrate objective response combination chemotherapy , clinically without progression since response appreciate . In general , patient treat least two successive combination regimen order achieve maximum benefit available chemotherapy . Patients achieve complete response therapy must receive one chemotherapy regimen outline Appendix D prior receive consolidation therapy . Exceptions generalization would include patient near complete response first regimen give , patient fit aggressive chemotherapy beyond initially use regimen respond . Patients must begin `` consolidation '' therapy within 6 week end last cycle induction chemotherapy , begin soon possible . Zubrod performance status 3 well . If PS = 3 must , opinion investigator , secondary effect induction chemotherapy underlie cancer . Patients history cardiac disease , ejection fraction ( EF ) less 50 % time initiation chemotherapy , must demonstrate ejection fraction least 40 % . In addition , patient receive 250 mg/m^2 doxorubicin induction phase , EKG change since initiation chemotherapy must EF least 45 % . Patients history cardiac disease , normal EKG 250 mg/m^2 doxorubicin require EF measurement . Provision write informed consent . Women childbearing potential must willing practice acceptable method birth control prevent pregnancy . Males take ZD1839 must also use birth control take drug avoid pregnancy partner . International normalized ratio ( INR ) elevation , bleeding , event report patient take warfarin . Patients take warfarin target INR &gt; = 2 , monitor regularly ( every week first cycle , monitor base experience first cycle ) change prothrombin time ( PT ) INR . Patients prophylactic low dose warfarin ( ie : 12 mg qd central line thrombosis prophylaxis ) require frequent monitoring . Predominantly small cell histology .

Incomplete heal previous oncologic major surgery Note requirement measurable evaluable disease . Evaluation response therapy endpoint trial . Prior treatment therapy specifically target HER family receptor . Patients peripheral neuropathy &gt; = grade 2 exclude . Patients may include neuropathy resolve grade 1 time register protocol . Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory find make undesirable subject participate trial . As judged investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , cardiac , hepatic renal disease ) . Any evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease ( patient chronic stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude ) .</criteria>
