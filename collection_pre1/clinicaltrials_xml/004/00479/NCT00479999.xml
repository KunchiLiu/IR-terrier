	<brief_summary>This study test whether two experimental HIV vaccine safe whether cause side effect healthy adult . It examine body immune response vaccine monitor social impact , , HIV vaccine study . The experimental vaccine study VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP ( also call rAd35-EnvA vaccine ) VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP ( also call rAd5-EnvA vaccine ) . The vaccine make use adenovirus ( virus normally cause respiratory infection cold ) modify contain DNA cod HIV protein . The vaccine cause HIV adenoviral infection . Healthy normal volunteer 18 50 year age may eligible 2-part study . Part 1 include 15 people . Part 2 include 20 people . Part 1 participant receive rAd35-EnvA vaccine . The first five people enrol receive low study dose vaccine . If dose safe , next five people enrol receive high dose . If dose safe , last 5 people enrol receive high study dose . Subjects Part I five clinic visit 24 week . Part II study start injection Part 1 give . Subjects Part 2 randomly assign one two vaccination schedule . One group receive rAd35-EnvA vaccine first , follow 12 week later rAd5-EnvA vaccine . The group receive vaccine reverse order ; , first rAd5-EnvA vaccine , follow 12 week later rAd35-EnvA vaccine . In schedule , first vaccination prime immune system immune response boost 12 week later different vaccine . Everyone study Part 2 receive rAd35-EnvA vaccine middle dose test Part 1 . Subjects Part 2 eight clinic visit 36 week . All vaccination give injection upper arm . At clinic visit , participant check health change problem . They ask feel take medication . Urine sample collect blood drawn visit . They test HIV several time ask question sexual behavior drug use . Throughout study , participant counsel HIV risk reduction . Subjects ask social effect may experience participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : The VRC recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5 ( rAd5 ) multiclade vaccine previously show elicit immune response HIV-1-specific peptide administer intramuscularly ( IM ) alone prime-boost schedule great magnitude frequency response Envelope A immunogen ( EnvA ) . Part I study open label , dose escalation evaluation HIV-1 adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine ( rAd35-EnvA ) . Subjects Group 1 receive one vaccination rAd35-EnvA 10 ( 9 ) PU . Subjects Group 2 receive one vaccination rAd35-EnvA 10 ( 10 ) PU . Subjects Group 3 receive one vaccination rAd35-EnvA 10 ( 11 ) PU . Part II ( Group 4 ) study randomize , double blind evaluation rAd35-EnvA vaccine comparison combination rAd5-EnvA vaccine prime-boost schedule . The hypothesis : 1 ) rAd35-EnvA vaccine safe human administration dosages 10 ( 11 ) PU single agent rAd35-EnvA rAd5-EnvA vaccine safe prime-boost regimen ; 2 ) rAd35-EnvA rAd5-EnvA vaccine elicit immune response EnvA immunogen 3 ) heterologous prime-boost regimen elicit great frequency magnitude response prim vaccination alone . The primary objective relate evaluation safety tolerability rAd35-EnvA rAd5-EnvA vaccine . Secondary objective related evaluation immunogenicity vaccine compare rAd35-EnvA rAd5-EnvA administer prime boost vaccination . Product Description : Both VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP ( rAd5-EnvA ) VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP ( rAd35-EnvA ) vaccine compose recombinant , replication deficient adenoviral vector encode HIV-1 clade A Env glycoprotein . Subjects : Thirty-five healthy adult volunteer , 18 50 year old ; begin Version 2.0 protocol , subject Part I must Ad35 antibody ( Ab ) seronegative subject Part II must Ad5- Ad35-seronegative . Study Plan : Part I : Fifteen subject receive open-label 1 mL IM deltoid injection via needle syringe study agent . No one subject per day enrol dose group . Five day follow vaccination fifth volunteer dose group , internal safety review include principal investigator , clinical team medical officer determine whether proceed next dose level . Part II : Initiation enrollment Part II contingent upon completion enrollment Group 3 safety review 10 ( 9 ) 10 ( 10 ) PU dosage Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The safety review take place least 2 week follow-up last 10 ( 10 ) PU injection Group 2 available safety report ; DSMB safety review may occur enrollment Group 3 . Enrollment Group 4 randomize double-blinded . The first 10 subject Group 4 randomize 1:1 ratio heterologous prime-boost vaccination schedule rAd5-EnvA rAd35-EnvA administer 10 ( 10 ) PU dosage . The last 10 subject Group 4 randomize 1:1 ratio heterologous prime-boost vaccination schedule rAd5-EnvA administer 10 ( 10 ) PU rAd35-EnvA administer 10 ( 11 ) PU . All subject receive study agent administer 1 mL IM deltoid injection ( 12 week apart ) accord schedule . Study Duration The vaccination regimen clinical follow-up schedule Part I require 24 week Part II require 52 week complete . Part II subject contact annually 4 year study completion collection long-term follow-up information .</detailed_description>
