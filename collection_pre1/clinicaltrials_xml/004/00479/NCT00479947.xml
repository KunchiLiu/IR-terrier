	<brief_summary>Yeast vaginitis common ailment affect premenopausal woman Nigeria . This condition prevalent age group 21-30 year . More 75 % premenopausal woman university student diagnose yeast infection annually . In woman , recurrent rate vaginal candidiasis empiric therapy , stand 70 80 % . In addition , resistance anti-fungal agent increase alarm speed , particularly specie Candida albicans C tropicalis C glabrata . The healthy vaginal environment compose mainly lactobacilli organism suppress overgrowth large number pathogen occur include yeast . In pilot study , hypothesize oral administration two well documented strain lactobacilli ( L.rhamnosis GR-1 L.reuteri RC-14 ) give woman recurrent yeast vaginitis , follow standard therapy fluconazole result significant reduction recurrence rate disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY HYPOTHESIS The administration two well documented strain lactobacilli ( L.rhamnosis GR-1 L.reuteri RC-14 ) give woman recurrent yeast vaginitis , follow standard therapy fluconazole compare placebo result significant reduction recurrence rate disease . Methodology Study participant Inclusion criterion : - Premenopausal woman suffer acute chronic yeast vaginitis past history 3 4 episode 12 month select . - All participant must symptomatic , i.e . participant must identify suffer one following : abnormal/odourless vaginal discharge , dyspareunia dysuria , localize irritation discomfort around vagina . Exclusion criterion : - Participants must suffer urogenital infection condition HIV potentially alter response disease . Participants test excluded presence Trichomonas vaginalis Bacterial vaginosis inclusion . Other condition rule basis medical history clinical assessment . - Participants must pregnant . - Participants must younger 18 old 50 year . - Participants must menstruate diagnosis treatment Laboratory Diagnosis : Microscopic examination vaginal secretion 10 % KOH hypha mycelia Culture fungal agent use Sabbraoud agar/broth . Randomisation : • Participants randomise age , history previous ( past year ) yeast vaginitis . Treatment Protocol 100 premenopausal woman present acute yeast vaginitis past history 3 4 episode yeast vaginitis past 12 month treat one oral dose Fluconazole ( Diflucan ) , randomize 2 group : - Group A : Receiving one oral dose Fluconazole + oral placebo capsule 3 month . - Group B : Receiving one oral dose Fluconazole + capsule L. rhamnosus GR-1 L reuteri RC-14 contain 5 billion live organism 3 month . Both group patient follow 7days proof cure , 1 month , 2 month 3 month follow enrolment . At follow-up visit , patient check symptom examine physically . Vaginal swab test fungi microscopically culture , BV organisms use Nugent score BV Blue test kit vaginal sialidase . Data collect Symptoms : - Lifestyle questionnaire , include daily self-assessment presence severity condition ( discharge , irritation , ) first 7 day . To include self-determined definition recovery begin complete . Also include menstrual cycle information ( treatment , subject early , mid late cycle ? ) . - Physician assessment visit . Vaginal swabs – two per visit : - Day 0 ( treatment ) - Day 7 ( Proof cure two group ) . - 1 month treatment - 2 month treatment - 3 month treatment . Statistical Analysis In placebo group patient , anticipate 3 month period , recurrence rate 50 % occur , whereas , treatment arm reduction recurrence 25 % achieve . The study design power 80 % detect reduction recurrence two-sided 5 % significance level . Participants Recruitment : Subjects recruit woman attend urogenital tract infection clinic Faith Mediplex , Benin City . Risk No risk expect except usual adverse effect associate Fluconazole , otherwise probiotic lactobacillus generally regard safe ( GRAS ) know side effect attribute probiotic lactobacillus immunocompetent individual . Benefits There may benefit accrue probiotic arm study recurrence rate may low placebo . Also may direct benefit , information gather help u evaluate whether oral use probiotic could practically applicable environment vaginal yeast infection .</detailed_description>
