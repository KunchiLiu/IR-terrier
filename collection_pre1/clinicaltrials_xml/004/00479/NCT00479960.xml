	<detailed_description>The phospholipid mammalian spermatozoon posse distinctive highly unusual fatty acid composition , unique feature high proportion long chain ( C20-22 ) highly polyunsaturated fatty acyl group . In mammal , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ; 22:6 , n-3 ) dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) although , several specie , docosapentaenoic acid ( 22:5 , n-6 ) also major component 2 . The lipid composition major determinant membrane flexibility require characteristic flagellum movement spermatozoon fusogenic property membrane associate acrosome reaction fertilization . In addition , demonstrate lipid-derived mediator involve various signal transduction mechanism regulate spermatozoa function . Sperm motility therefore closely correlated fertility , yet factor control sperm motility human fully understand 12 . The amount PUFA , mainly DHA , less extent eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , show positively associate sperm motility essential optimal fertility . The reduction amount DHA sperm lipid correlate reduced sperm concentration , sperm progressive motility proportion cell normal morphology . In asthenozoospermic ( poor sperm forward motility ) , level DHA ( total PUFA ) find low normozoospermic individual despite similar serum fatty acid composition 18 . Broiler spermatozoon rich EPA DHA show significantly increase fertility follow artificial insemination ( AI ) . Chilling injury mammalian gamete describe irreversible damage occur upon cool low , non-freezing , temperature . Several study suggest chill injury major limit factor successful gamete cryopreservation . Other study suggest membrane primary site structural functional chill injury sperm oocytes . Additionally , membrane chill injury dependent biochemical biophysical property membrane . The plasma membrane thermotropic lipid phase transition ( Tm ) fluid liquid crystalline phase rigid gel phase associate chilling injury . When membrane lipid undergo lipid phase transition ( LPT ) , fluidity decrease structure function membrane change . As result , membrane permeability increase cell damage . The temperature Tm occur greatly affected fatty acid composition membrane . Membranes consist lipid multiple unsaturations short carbon chain fluid low temperature . The ability spermatozoal plasma membrane resist structural damage cryopreservation may therefore related fatty acid composition strength bond membrane component 38 . It show , example , spermatozoa Asian elephant , chill sensitive African elephant sperm , contain low concentration PUFA membrane especially poor DHA . There several way change chill sensitivity Tm mammalian gamete . Spermatozoa spontaneously interact liposome describe several study . Previous work suggest phospholipid adsorb sperm cell , cool 4oC , increase chill resistance sperm cell bovine , ram elephant . The relationship dietary component reproduction well establish . Follicular maturation , ovulation oestrus female , libido fertility male , might adversely affected undernutrition . Men infertile semen find consume less omega-3 fatty acid fertile men , significant correlation establish consumption alpha-linolenic acid ( 18:3n-3 ) one hand sperm concentration progressive motility hand . In boar , output accessory gland , output spermatozoon testis , affect reduce feed intake likely reflect suppression androgen secretion . Various report show enrichment diet PUFA alter biophysical property reproductive performance mammalian avian sperm oocyte . Objectives expect significance research Male patient arrive male fertility clinic frequently suffer one following : asthenozoospermia ( low progressive motility ) , teratozoopermia ( abnormal morphology ) and/or oligozoospermia ( low sperm count ) , collectively know O.T.A It assume supplement diet patient omega-3 PUFA , improvement parameter achieve . Since number normal cell patient limited , omega-3 PUFA supplementation may confer needed change sperm plasma membrane , make cell resistant chill injury preservation . This provide u mean ascertain normal cell survive freeze thaw process involve cryopreservation . By achieve able make sure enough normal cell available fertilization . If hypothesis study prove correct , mean simple dietary mean able improve reproduction need . Comprehensive description methodology plan operation 1 . Experimental design : The experiment randomized double-blind , placebo control , crossed-over trial . The experiment start pilot conduct 20 participant , out-patients male fertility clinic Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel . The pilot expect follow large scale trial similar design ( without `` cross-over '' part ) . Both pilot large scale trial seek obtain approval Helsinki committee Shaare Zedek Medical Center prior initiation . All participant ask sign inform consent . 2 . Basic spermatozoa database : For general information human spermatozoon , fresh frozen sample normal subfertile male analyze total lipid fatty acid composition gas chromatography . All sample evaluate basic sperm quality characteristic accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline 66 . Samples separate seminal plasma store till fatty acid composition analysis . Determination lipid phase transition temperature FTIR spectrometer fresh sample also conduct . 3 . Dietary supplementation : At begin trial participant provide 120 capsule either placebo commercially available omega-3 fatty acid . The capsule consume follow manner : 2 capsule daily first week , 3 capsule per day second week start third week , 4 capsule per day till consume . At point break 4 week switch group resume protocol . During entire period participant also provide vitamin E pill anti-oxidant . 4 . During post-experimental sperm characterization : Each participate patient provide 5 sample dietary supplementation pilot experiment : Once begin trial , middle two segment ( see dietary supplementation paragraph detail ) , cross-over point end trial . All sample analyze way describe . 5 . Lipid phase transition determination : Approximately 10 participant pilot trial request provide additional sample cross point end trial determination lipid phase transition temperature FTIR spectrometer . These participant select base sperm fatty acid composition begin trial cover wide range composition possible . 6 . Large scale trial : After analyze result pilot trial , decision make indication proceed large scale trial . Assuming result indicate need , large scale trial conduct . Experimental design randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . The number participate patient determine time decision proceed trial make . At time decision also make male fertility clinic additional medical center invite participate .</detailed_description>
