	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Interaction Between Sildenafil Sublingual Glyceryl Trinitrate ( GTN ) Men With Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By produce mediator know cGMP , nitric oxide ( NO ) potently dilate blood vessel . Nitrates , glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) , drug release NO ( NO donor ) widely use treatment prevention angina . Sildenafil effective treatment male penile erectile dysfunction inhibits breakdown cGMP . When give alone cause modest reduction BP healthy people patient cardiovascular disease . By synergistic action , co-administration NO donor sildenafil result large reduction BP patient angina , population increase risk develop erectile dysfunction . As result , recommend two drug co-administered within 24 hour one another . Previous study define effect nitrate 60 min administration sildenafil , time likely maximum interaction . However , emergency medicine physician would value evidence balance risk make personal clinical judgement might consider give GTN patient present severe episode angina recently receive sildenafil . Evidence base judgement currently available . However , recently complete study , show interaction GTN ( 0.4 mg spray ) sildenafil ( 100 mg ) last less 4 hour healthy subject . Whilst finding would probably similar patient angina , question need investigate directly order ensure generalisability work address important unresolved clinical issue . Subjects ask refrain use short-acting nitrate 24 hour long act nitrate 72 hour start study . On morning study visit subject take normal medication , include anti-anginals , soon wake home . They also eat light breakfast home come research unit . Subjects attend 4 study visit , separate least 5 day . At study visit 1 GTN administer 4 8 hour oral sildenafil match placebo . At visit 2 GTN administer 4 8 hour alternative treatment ( sildenafil placebo ) . The order sildenafil placebo give randomise . At study visit 3 GTN administer 1 6 hour sildenafil placebo . Finally , visit 4 GTN administer 1 6 hour alternative treatment ( sildenafil placebo ) . As visit 1 2 , order sildenafil placebo give randomise . Regular single measure sit standing ( 2 min stand ) BP heart rate ( HR ) record baseline 40 minute GTN administration . Venous blood sample ( 20 mL ) take baseline immediately 40 min GTN administration later determination plasma concentration sildenafil active metabolite , UK-103,320 .</detailed_description>
