	<brief_title>Artemisinin Resistance Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total number 90 volunteer acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria randomly assign treat either artesunate monotherapy 7 day combination quinine tetracycline 7 day ( follow 2nd line national treatment guideline national malaria control program ) ratio 2:1 . The study design base WHO recommendations 'Assessment Monitoring Antimalarial Drug Efficacy Treatment Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria ' ( WHO , 2003 ) . Study participant otherwise healthy malaria patient ( adult men non-pregnant woman age 18 65 year ) uncomplicated falciparum malaria recruit Battambong Province , Cambodia . The artesunate administer orally ( single dose 200 mg per day ) total duration 7 day ( Directly Observed Therapy ) . Quinine ( 30 mg/kg/day ) plus tetracycline ( 25 mg/kg/day ) also administer 7 day split dose every 8 hour follow national treatment guideline Cambodia . Patients admit hospital duration study drug administration sign symptom malaria disappear , whichever come first . Thereafter Day 21 patient remain malaria-free environment ( Sampov Luon Ta Sanh ) either hospital living facility provide study site patient supervise study personnel . After Day 21 follow outpatient Day 28 schedule follow-up visit Day 28 . In vitro drug sensitivity assay perform sample inclusion case recrudescence . Drug level measure artesunate arm first last day therapy . Primary clinical outcome cure ( Adequate Clinical Parasitological Response - ACPR ) Day 28 . Secondary outcome measure time parasite , fever , gametocyte clearance ( PCT , FCT , GCT ) . Parasite genotyping use distinguish recrudescence reinfections PCR . Subjects monitor clinical adverse event throughout study duration . Blood drawn day admission ( initiate therapy ) vitro drug sensitivity test PCR ( marker drug resistance distinguish recrudescence reinfection genotyping ) . Malaria smear prepare 4 time day parasite clearance Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 whenever symptom consistent malaria appear . Plasma sample determine drug level obtain first last day therapy . Over entire study , approximately 64 ml blood may draw venipuncture . Study participation individual 28 day .</detailed_description>
