	<brief_summary>Taxanes ( paclitaxel ) highly active treat breast cancer . Abraxane® ( nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel ) compare standard paclitaxel improve efficacy tolerability . When combined taxane , platinum agent improve response metastatic breast cancer , carboplatin confer less toxicity cisplatin . Monoclonal antibody include bevacizumab target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) reduce angiogenesis . We hypothesize previously-untested combination weekly Abraxane® carboplatin plus biweekly bevacizumab lengthen time progression without produce intolerable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anthracycline-based chemotherapy widely use adjuvant treatment breast cancer . In addition challenge pose anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity , issue surround previous treatment anthracyclines limit utility metastatic disease set . Many patient advanced disease prior anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy , may reach maximum cumulative lifetime dose , develop refractory disease , create obvious need non-anthracycline treatment strategies.3 Platinum- taxane-based chemotherapy first-line therapy metastatic breast cancer demonstrate significant activity , produce single-agent response rate &gt; 50 % ; combination rate increase &gt; 60 % previously untreated patient previously receive anthracyclines.3 However , overall survival remain relatively unchanged.4 As currently standard care patient metastatic breast cancer , various physical psychological factor must consider evaluate chemotherapy treatment option , include patient 's tumor biology growth rate , presence extent metastasis , history prior treatment response , sensitivity tolerance therapy , quality life.2 Strategies develop combination , high dose , sequential regimen use active agent , improve response rate and/or time progression , may produce increased toxicity without increase survival.2 Because metastatic breast cancer remain essentially incurable use cytotoxic therapy alone , study target biologics offer new opportunity enhance drug delivery via ability regulate specific receptor associate clinically aggressive disease process .</detailed_description>
