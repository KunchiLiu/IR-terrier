	<brief_summary>The current study investigate comparative efficacy , safety patient satisfaction intradetrusor injection BOTOX速 injection ( 200U ) versus placebo ( saline ) injection treatment OAB secondary benign prostatic obstruction ( BPO ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>This Prospective , Randomized , Double-Blind Study Comparing Intravesical Injection Botox速 Placebo .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder common problem follow chronic prostatic bladder outlet obstruction part benign prostatic hyperplasia syndrome ( BPH ) men . Unfortunately , often resolve treatment ( TURP , etc ) obstruction enlarge prostate gland . Patients obstructive BPH typically commence treatment alpha-blocker anticholinergic agent ; former use treat enlarged prostate medically , latter treat overactive bladder symptom . However , mention , anticholinergic cause many intolerable side effect lead discontinuation many patient . Furthermore class drug still consider relative contraindication population clinician . Therefore modality need study men . Based numerous study overactive bladder ( OAB ) , hypothesize patient experience significant improvement ( particularly symptom urgency frequency ) without significant side effect intradetrusor injection BOTOX速 even though refractory systemic anticholinergic .</detailed_description>
