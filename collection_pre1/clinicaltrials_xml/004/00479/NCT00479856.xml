	<criteria>Signed informed consent . Histologically/cytologically confirm breast cancer ; If disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature lesion must confirm cytology histology . Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) [ Therasse , 2000 ] . Documented amplification ErbB2 gene fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) document overexpression ErbB2 protein 3+ IHC primary metastatic tumor tissue . Subjects must relapse breast cancer disease progress ≤ 12 month completion trastuzumabcontaining therapy neoadjuvant adjuvant setting . Note : Progression define use RECIST criterion , , either appearance new lesion &gt; =20 % increase sum long diameter ( LD ) . Subjects must receive prior anticancer therapy metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Subjects receive prior antihormonal agent combine trastuzumab treatment disease first present ER positive MBC recur receive trastuzumab ≤ 3 month complete therapy eligible . Subjects stable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases confirmed computerized tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) allow . Treatment prophylactic anticonvulsant permit , unless list within Prohibited Medications . Subjects must baseline cardiac ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ³50 % measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) ( multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan ECHO perform ) . The modality use baseline must use repeat assessment throughout study . Only subject control asymptomatic angina arrhythmia eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . Subjects must archive tumor tissue initial diagnosis available analysis . If tissue initial diagnosis available , tissue must obtain recurrent metastatic site prior initiate study treatment . Female ≥18 year . Subject must adequate organ function define Table 1 . Table 1 : Baseline Laboratory Values Adequate Organ Function . SYSTEM Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count : ≥1.5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin : ≥9 g/dL Platelets : ≥ 75 X 10^9/L Hepatic : AST , ALT Alkaline phosphatase : ≤ 2.5 X ULN Unless concomitant docetaxel , ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT , AP ≤ 2.5 x ULN Unless document liver metastasis , ≤ 5 x ULN Serum bilirubin : ≤ 2.0 X ULN Albumin : ≥ 2.5 g/dL Renal : Serum Creatinine : ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR Calculate Creatinine Clearance : ≥ 40 mL/min 1 . Calculated Cockcroft Gault Method [ Cockcroft , 1976 ] . Pregnant lactating female . Women childbearing potential practice approve contraceptive method ( example , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device ) begin 2 week first dose investigational product 28 day final dose investigational product . History malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Concurrent therapy give treat cancer ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , antihormonal therapy ) take study medication . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . Malabsorption syndrome resection stomach small bowel significantly affect gastrointestinal function . Have current active haptic biliary disease ( excpetion patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Concurrent disease condition , opinion physician , would make subject inappropriate study participation serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety ( example , uncontrolled infection , psychiatric condition prohibit understanding rendering informed consent ) . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial involve investigational agent anticancer therapy . Bisphosphonates may initiate first dose study medication . Considered Investigator life expectancy le 3 month . Not able swallow retain oral medication . The subject know unmanageable hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate lapatinib excipients related capecitabine , docetaxel , nab paclitaxel excipients .</criteria>
