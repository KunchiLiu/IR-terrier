	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial TPI 287 Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , 2-stage Simon design , Phase 2 study TPI 287 patient metastatic , hormone-refractory prostate cancer . All patient must receive prior taxane therapy . Up 80 patient enrol stratify base duration cumulative exposure single prior taxane regimen . A single taxane regimen consider taxane taxane contain therapy administer defined schedule 2 month ' interruption treatment , total exposure assess number month schedule . One stratum ( 40 patient ) consist patient 3 month ( maximum 10 month ) exposure taxane regimen , document progression disease ( initially taxane sensitive ) . The second stratum ( 40 patient ) consist patient consider primarily resistant taxanes document progressive disease best response exposure single taxane regimen less equal 3 month . Patients may receive prior hormonal therapy and/or bisphosphonates may continue therapy . In first stage trial , 22 patient stratum treat TPI 287 intravenously every 21 day . If 1 few patient either stratum demonstrate response first stage , trial discontinue stratum . Otherwise , additional 18 patient stratum show 2 response enrol second stage study . If 4 few patient demonstrate response total study population either stratum stag 1 2 , drug consider interest prostate cancer patient define stratum .</detailed_description>
