	<brief_summary>This study determine immune response malaria infection healthy volunteer compare malaria patient . Malaria affect million people Mali Africa . It cause fever , headache , body ache , weakness . Without treatment , disease serious child . Developing effective vaccine parasite cause malaria crucial step toward control disease ; however , vaccine test far provide short-lived protection . A good understanding natural immunity malaria may provide insight apply develop effective vaccine . People 18 year age older live Kambila , Tieneguebougou Kalifabougou , Mali , good health may eligible study . Participants undergo complete physical examination start study year 4-year duration study . They maximum nine clinic visit year collect blood sample research . The visit last one hour , include 30-minute observation time blood draw .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria result least 2.7 million death per year , majority among African child . The development vaccine Plasmodium falciparum regard crucial step toward control disease . Unfortunately , vaccine candidate result short-lived protection best . The ineffectiveness current vaccine may reflect kinetics naturally acquire immunity malaria multiple infection require year partial protection achieve immunity lose , become less effective , absence recurrent infection . The mechanisms underlying delayed acquisition presumably rapid loss humoral immunity poorly understood . A detailed understanding process cellular level may important vaccine development . We currently study cellular basis humoral immunity P. falciparum research collaboration Malaria Research Training Center ( MRTC ) Bamako , Mali National Institutes Health ( NIH ) United States . This protocol support research ensure supply blood sample healthy Malian adult order establish normal immunologic parameter population optimize research assay perform MRTC .</detailed_description>
