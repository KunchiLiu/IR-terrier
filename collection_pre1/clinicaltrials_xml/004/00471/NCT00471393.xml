	<brief_title>Topical Diclofenac Efficacy Symptomatic Relief Temporomandibular Degenerative Joint Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure efficacy topical diclofenac topical placebo symptomatic relief degenerative temporomandibular joint disease female population age 18-45 year age . Primary Objectives : - To compare efficacy placebo diclofenac topical PLO gel term functional pain intensity symptomatic temporomandibular degenerative joint disease participant compare baseline measure obtain prior commencement study , measurement obtain 30 , 60 90 day treatment intervention use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Secondary Objectives : - To compare efficacy placebo diclofenac topical PLO gel term measurement range motion voluntary assist vertical jaw open symptomatic temporomandibular degenerative joint disease ( TMDJD ) participant compare baseline measure obtain prior commencement study , Time 0 , use 100 mm ruler measure obtain 30 , 60 90 day treatment intervention . - To compare efficacy placebo diclofenac term effect quality life symptomatic TMDJD participant compare baseline measure obtain prior commencement study , Time 0 , measure obtain 90 consecutive day treatment , utilize subsection The Brief Pain Inventory Scale ( BPI ) relate quality life . - To compare efficacy placebo diclofenac term effect pain intensity symptomatic TMDJD participant compare baseline measure obtain prior commencement study , Time 0 , measure obtain 90 consecutive day treatment , utilize subsection The Brief Pain Inventory Scale ( BPI ) ( Cleeland &amp; Ryan , 1994 ) relate pain intensity . - To compare efficacy placebo diclofenac topical PLO gel term effect disability specific activity daily live TMDJD participant compare baseline measure obtain prior commencement study , Time 0 , obtain 90 consecutive day treatment , utilize The Pain Disability Index ( PDI ) ( Bush &amp; Harkin , 1995 ) . Tertiary Objectives - To compare adverse effect document topical diclofenac group document topical placebo group . - To compare amount breakthrough medication use topical diclofenac group versus placebo group order ass use topical diclofenac reduces amount oral medication . - To compare reason withdrawal study topical placebo topical diclofenac group . The null hypothesis difference efficacy topical diclofenac topical placebo treatment degenerative temporomandibular joint disease .</detailed_description>
