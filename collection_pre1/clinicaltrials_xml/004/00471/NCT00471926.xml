	<detailed_description>Diabetes global epidemic ; fourth fifth lead cause death develop newly industrialize country . People diabetes mean long-term condition deserves effective efficient care throughout life . Complications cause diabetes , coronary artery peripheral vascular disease , stroke , diabetic neuropathy , amputation , renal failure blindness result increase disability , reduce life expectancy , even apprehensive , enormous healthcare relate expense virtually every society ( 1 , 2 ) . Diabetes certainly one challenge health issue 21st century . The recent epidemiological data suggest diabetes population Taiwan reach one million ( 3 ) . People diabetes use healthcare insurance regularly diabetes care , however , 60 % total diabetes population . Nevertheless , 60 % Taiwan diabetes population already consume 12 % total national annual healthcare expenditure take care . In fact , diabetes population merely one- forty Taiwan population whole . Even bad thing 60 % whole yearly healthcare budget take care diabetes go treatment diabetes-related complication ( 4,5 ) . We recently learn prevention trial , Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) type 1 diabetes United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) type 2 diabetes , effective adequate performance metabolic blood pressure control patient diabetes would able delay even prevent diabetes-related complication ( 6-8 ) . These intervention , broadly implement , would help improve live quality diabetes patient , well consequently make big gain healthcare expenditure ( 9 ) . In order ass completely level diabetes care deliver Taiwan , nationally standardized performance measure evaluate quality diabetes care accurately reliably . These performance measure seriously review discussed aspect practicability , feasibility compliancy , series nation-wide consensus meeting number multidisciplinary professional Taiwan Diabetes Care Teams ( TDCTs ) , deliver clinical setting ( 10 ) .
