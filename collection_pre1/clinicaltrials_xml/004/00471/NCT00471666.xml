	<brief_summary>This study examine clinical , immunological epidemiological effect concurrent infection P. falciparum W. bancrofti M. perstans ( parasite cause malaria filariasis ) frequency severity malaria infection child young adult Mali , Africa . Residents Tien gu bougou Bougoudiana , Mali , 1 20 year age may eligible study . Participants without filarial infection enrol . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Baseline evaluation medical history physical examination , blood test stool culture - Brief physical examination weekly - Blood test monthly malaria - Standard treatment offer anyone malaria - Blood test filarial infection beginning , midpoint end transmission season - Treatment lymphatic filariasis available National Program Elimination Lymphatic Filariasis . There effective standard therapy M. perstans . - Treatment parasitic worm infection , need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Residents malaria-endemic region frequently expose variety parasites concurrently malarial parasite . In Mali , lymphatic filariasis due Wuchereria bancrofti co-exists several region highly endemic malaria , co-infection common resident area . Because chronicity filarial infection associate bias towards development adaptive immune response dominate Th2 cytokine , pre-existing filarial infection potential alter immune response towards incoming malarial parasite , clearance consider dependent robust Th1 response . This could , turn , affect clinical manifestation outcomes malaria infection . Conversely , immune response filarial parasite may modulate presence malarial parasite . In addition share human host , Plasmodium falciparum Wuchereria bancrofti transmit mosquito vector , Anopheles gambiae , interaction two specie vector may important implication transmission two infection . The primary goal study determine effect concurrent infection P. falciparum W. bancrofti parasites prevalence severity malaria infection child live Malian village co-endemic two parasite assess effect co-infection immune response two parasite course malaria transmission season . The epidemiology co-infection human vector level also examine .</detailed_description>
