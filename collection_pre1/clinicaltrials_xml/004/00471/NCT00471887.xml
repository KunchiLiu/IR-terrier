Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well ticilimumab ( CP-675,206 ) work treat patient stage IIIC stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticilimumab ( CP-675,206 ) Treating Patients With Stage IIIC Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine change melanoma intratumoral infiltrates CD8 positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes patient stage IIIC IV melanoma treat ticilimumab ( CP-675,206 ) . Secondary - Determine effect drug intratumoral immune effector cell tumor cell patient . - Determine effect drug circulate immune effector cell patient . - Determine gene expression profile immune effector cell tumor cell regress nonregressing tumor patient . - Bank plasma peripheral blood obtain patient regress nonregressing tumor future exploratory analysis proteomic profile . - Assess additional evidence antitumor activity drug , measure best on-study response rate , patient . - Characterize safety profile tolerability drug patient . - Obtain pharmacokinetic data use future meta-analysis drug 's pharmacokinetics . - Determine whether CTLA4 genotype influence safety , immune response , and/or efficacy drug patient . - Determine relationship clinical response ( i.e. , efficacy toxicity ) tumor and/or blood ex vivo analysis patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize study . Patients receive ticilimumab ( CP-675,206 ) IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 90 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study correlative pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacogenetic , pharmacogenomic analysis . Blood specimen obtain PK measurement baseline periodically study treatment analysis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Blood specimen also evaluate pharmacogenetic assessment polymorphism CTLA4 . Patients also undergo leukapheresis baseline least day 30-60 biomarker analysis immune cell activation ( i.e. , CD45RO , CD45RA , HLA-DR , CCR5 , CCR7 , CD62L , CD69 ) ; Treg phenotype ( i.e. , CD4/CD25/GITR/intracellular FoxP3 ) ; Treg function . In HLA-A2.1 positive patient , PBMC analyze antigen-specific immune reactivity MART-1 , gp100 , tyrosine MHC tetramer use enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay . Plasma obtain leukapheresis assessed level circulate cytokine chemokines . Some plasma store future proteomic profile analysis . Patients also undergo excisional punch biopsy baseline day 30-60 course 1 . Tumor tissue sample embed paraffin analyzed hematoxylin-eosin immunohistochemical stain several biomarkers , include biomarkers immune cell response ( i.e. , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 ) biomarkers melanoma ( i.e. , S-100 , MART-1 , and/or HMB45 ) . Frozen tumor tissue sample analyze gene chip gene array gene expression profile quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction FoxP3 . Minced tumor tissue sample analyze flow cytometry nonadherent cell HLA-DR ( tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte available ) Braf sequence adherent cell ( melanoma cell available ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
