	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study demonstrate blood pressure lower effect CasiGold CasiMax subject high-normal blood pressure mild hypertension . The secondary purpose collect human safety data treatment CasiGold CasiMax , gain insight potential mechanism measurement renin angiotensin I II , evaluate genetic determinant individual BP lower response measurement specific genetic polymorphism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Milk Proteins Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Hypertension major controllable risk factor associate cardiovascular disease . The risk develop CVD directly relate blood pressure ( BP ) level . Tripeptides IPP VPP obtain milk protein show potential blood lower effect . The renin-angiotensin system one major pathway BP regulation , ACE inhibition important target BP control . CasiGold CasiMax hydrolyse casein preparation consist relatively high concentration tripeptides ACE inhibitory property vitro may beneficial effect blood pressure . Study population : 84 female male Caucasians high-normal blood pressure mild hypertension , age 30 - 70 year Day 01 study BMI 18 - 32 kg/m2 , participate study . Intervention : All subject receive treatment , different order . One treatment consist daily consumption two capsule Casigold contain IPP period 4 week . One treatment consist daily consumption two capsule Casimax contain mixture tripeptides period 4 week . And one treatment consist daily consumption two capsule placebo period 4 week . One capsule take upon completion breakfast one capsule take upon completion dinner . Main study parameter : The main study parameter blood pressure 4 week treatment . Blood pressure measure study site two last day treatment period . Other study parameter include evaluation safety end treatment period , determination genetic polymorphism . Analysis renin angiotensin I II do case change BP find .</detailed_description>
