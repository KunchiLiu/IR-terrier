	<brief_title>Angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose therapeutic angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . Secondary - Determine tumor response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive therapeutic angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) subcutaneously day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos therapeutic angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity first 3 week study therapy . At least 6 patient treated MTD . Blood sample collect patient first fifth dos study drug pharmacokinetic correlative study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
