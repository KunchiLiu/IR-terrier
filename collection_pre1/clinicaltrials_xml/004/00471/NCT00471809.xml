	<detailed_description>The MARS trial randomize , double-blind , parallel group study compare capacity azithromycin montelukast placebo effective adjunctive therapy allow reduction inhale corticosteroid child age 6 17 year moderate-to-severe persistent asthma . The primary null hypothesis child moderate-to-severe persistent asthma , macrolide antibiotic ( Mac - azithromycin ) leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA - montelukast ) provide steroid-sparing effect compare placebo dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS - budesonide ) reduce . This test follow achievement control symptoms moderate high-dose ICS combination long-acting bronchodilator agonist ( LABA - salmeterol ) . Use dose inhale corticosteroid base NHLBI step-up guideline achieve asthma control . Inadequate asthma control define either : 1. chronic poor control : ) symptom , albuterol use symptom low peak flow , peak flow less 80 % baseline great 3 day per week average , b ) nocturnal awakening asthma symptom require albuterol 2 night 2 week observation , c ) FEV1 le 80 % best pre-randomization value 2 consecutive visit 1-4 day apart , 2. asthma exacerbation determine need systemic corticosteroid Treatment run-in period determine child 's status first visit . At enrollment ( V0 ) patient give budesonide ICS salmeterol LABA . Children treat salmeterol BID dose ICS base chronic medication use stepping-down base time symptom criterion inadequate control indication stepping-up dose ICS . When inadequate control document ( V1 ) , four-day course prednisone administer dose ICS ( still administer salmeterol BID ) double establish control . The child follow monthly clinic visit interim phone call , emphasize use daily diary document symptom dose albuterol require . Reestablishment control 2-week interval prompt randomization . If control yet establish first increase ICS dose stabilization period , dose double along second prednisone course maximum budesonide 1600 mcg/day attain . The daily dose budesonide randomization minimum 800 mcg allow maximum 4-fold reduction dose , maximum 1600 mcg allow patient safety consider side effect high dose ICS . When clinical control achieve increase dose ICS , child randomize ( V2 ) one three treatment arm , ( 1 ) placebo ( one placebo tablet one two placebo capsule ) , ( 2 ) azithromycin ( one placebo tablet one two capsule contain azithromycin dose base weight ) , ( 3 ) montelukast ( one tablet contain montelukast dose base age indicated package insert one two placebo capsule ) . Children follow additional six week dose ICS achieve control ( `` 1X '' ) + salmeterol BID study medication ( V3 ) . They undergo three 6-week period ICS reduction ( V4 , V5 , V6 ) , first ¾ control dose ( `` 0.75X '' ) , ½ control dose ( `` 0.5X '' ) ¼ control dose ( `` 0.25X '' ) , use salmeterol BID concomitant medication . The ICS dose salmeterol open-label . Criteria treatment failure discharge study establish set criterion indicate reappearance inadequate control asthma exacerbation asthma . At end double-blind administration oral study medication ( V6 ) , patient discharge study meet one criterion inadequate control asthma study medication discontinue , subject continue take placebo capsule addition ¼ ICS plus salmeterol . They follow additional 6-week single-blind wash-out period interim contact phone 3 week determine course asthma control determine persistence effect study medication ( V7 ) . The procedure perform V0 inform consent , pregnancy test , complete physical exam , spirometry , bronchodilator response . The procedure perform V1 spirometry , complete blood count , blood IgE eosinophils , brief physical exam , EKG , genotyping . The following procedure perform V2 V7 : brief physical exam , spirometry , force oscillometry , exhale nitric oxide , asthma control questionnaire , asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire , sinusitis questionnaire . In addition , allergy skin test perform V2 , pregnancy test V2 V6 , methacholine challenge V2 V3 , polymerase chain reaction atypical organism macrolide antibiotic resistance ( nasal wash ) V2 , V5 , V7 . Finally , child maintain daily diary record morning evening symptom , peak expiratory flow rate , rescue medication use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At Enrollment ( V0 ) : Age 617 year time enrollment . A goal 33 % minority 40 % female subject incorporate recruitment Weighs least 25 kg Asthma diagnose physician present least one year prior study entry Moderate severe persistent asthma : 1 . Patients identify follow general category . The general principle patient uncontrolled relatively low dose ICS steppedup , control moderate high dose ICS steppeddown . ) On low dose ICS without salmeterol uncontrolled . This patient treat budesonide salmeterol determine eligibility criterion . If addition salmeterol result control symptom , patient would exclude MARS . If control establish low dose budesonide salmeterol , dose budesonide would increase entry criterion evaluate base algorithm Figure 1. ii ) On dose ICS equivalent budesonide 400 mcg per day without medication uncontrolled . This patient treat budesonide salmeterol determine eligibility criterion . iii ) On dose ICS equivalent budesonide 800 mcg per day without medication control . iv ) On dose ICS equivalent budesonide 1600 mcg per day without medication uncontrolled require prednisone acutely . These patient follow see become well controlled increase adherence careful monitoring symptom . 2 . Examples give Advair drug commonly use form ICS LABA : ) Patients Advair 100/50 bid inadequately control ii ) Patients Advair 250/50 bid inadequately control iii ) Patients Advair 250/50 bid well control great 3 month consider steppingdown Advair 100/50 iv ) Patients well control Advair 100/50 bid + either montelukast theophylline great 3 month consider steppingdown Advair 100/50 bid alone v ) Patients Advair 500/50 bid well control great 3 month consider steppingdown Advair 250/50 vi ) Patients well control Advair 250/50 bid + either montelukast theophylline great 3 month consider steppingdown Advair 250/50 bid alone 3 . Patients equivalent budesonide 400 mcg , 800 mcg , 1600 mcg per day symptom , FEV1 le 80 % predict , enrol uncontrolled observe closely symptoms low peak flow 2 week . The rationale enrolling patient observe `` uncontrolled '' patient FEV1 range normal may symptoms and/or low peak flow become apparent close observation appropriate education . Note percent predict value FEV1 use enrollment visit , criterion control inadequate control runin doubleblind portion study use high FEV1 value obtain runin decision prior randomization FEV1 randomization decision subsequent visit . FEV1 least 80 % predict go stepdown enrollment least 50 % predict already suboptimally control historically observed 2 week define baseline symptom . FEV1 measurement obtain prebronchodilator .
