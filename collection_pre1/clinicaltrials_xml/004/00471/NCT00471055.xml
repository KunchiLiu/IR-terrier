	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Symptomatic Control Patient With Knee Osteoarthritis Between 0.0125 % Capsaicin Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common form arthritis population . It characterize pathologically focal loss articular cartilage marginal central new bone formation . OA knee , principal large joint affect , result disable knee symptom estimate 10 % people older 55 year , quarter severely disable . The risk disability attributable knee OA alone great due cardiac disease great due medical disorder elderly . A recent World Health Organization report global burden disease indicate knee OA likely become fourth important global cause disability woman eighth important men . Knee OA associate symptom pain functional disability . Physical disability arise pain loss functional capacity reduce quality life increase risk morbidity mortality . Current treatment aim alleviate symptom mild moderate OA several different method : non-pharmacological treatment ( example education , exercise , lifestyle change ) pharmacological treatment ( example paracetamol , NSAIDs Capsaicin gel topical treatment ) . Current evidence support various treatment current use , however , variable . Capsaicin , active principle hot chili pepper , think selectively stimulate unmyelinated C fibre afferent neuron cause release substance P. Prolonged application capsaicin reversibly deplete store substance P , possibly neurotransmitter , sensory nerve ending . This reduce abolish transmission painful stimuli peripheral nerve fibres high centres.There many study Capsaicin gel confirm effectiveness capsaicin gel many dosage . However , efficacy study capsaicin 0.0125 % Thai produce `` Capsika gel `` , therefore , study propose .</detailed_description>
