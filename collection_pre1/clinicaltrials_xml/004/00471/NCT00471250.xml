	<brief_summary>This study collect fluid tissue specimens lung nose healthy people people history lung infection . The specimen examine difference two group may associate susceptibility certain infection . Healthy normal volunteer people history lung infection 18 75 year age follow NIH may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Medical history physical examination . Blood urine test . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) chest x-ray . Treadmill exercise stress test ( people 45 year old history chest pain ECG abnormality ) . Bronchoscopy : The subject nose throat numb lidocaine sedative give comfort . A thin flexible tube call bronchoscope advance nose mouth lung airways examine airway carefully . Fluid collection bronchoscopy use one follow method : - Bronchoalveolar lavage : Salt water inject bronchoscope lung immediately suction , wash cell line airway . - Bronchial brushing : A brush-tipped wire enclose sheath pass bronchoscope small area airway tissue gently brush . The brush withdrawn tissue adhere . - Endobronchial biopsy : Small pinchers wire pass bronchoscope 1 2 millimeter tissue remove . - Nasal scrape : A small device use scrape along inside nose collect cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol involve one following procedures healthy volunteer patient know suspected predisposition respiratory infection enrol National Institutes Health ( NIH ) protocols : 1 ) Adults : bronchoscopy sample bronchoalveolar lavage fluid epithelial cell healthy adult volunteer patient ; 2 ) Adults Children : sputum induction collection sputum specimens ; 3 ) Adults Children : nasal mucosal biopsy brushing sample epithelial cell . The cellular acellular sample separate , store transferred appropriate laboratory investigate disease . Alveolar macrophage predominant ( great 95 % ) cell type present lavage normal subject . Alveolar macrophage play central role initiation propagation lung inflammation release cytokine ( i.e. , interleukin-1 , tumor necrosis factor ) chemokines ( i.e. , interleukin-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein , macrophage inflammatory protein ) activate resident cell recruit inflammatory cell local nidus inflammation . Airway epithelial cell know release variety mediator well . Thus , interaction cell mediator generate alveolar cell bronchial epithelial cell acute inflammation key element initiation pulmonary inflammatory response . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , bronchial brushing , mucosal biopsy standard diagnostic technique do bronchoscope obtain sample alveolar bronchial specimen diagnosis infection , malignancy , non-infectious inflammation . Nasal mucosal scrape biopsy minimally invasive method obtain airway epithelial cell diagnose disorder airway clearance associate abnormal cilium ( hair-like structure airway line cell ) . Sputum induction routinely perform procedure facilitate collection respiratory secretion ( mucus ) stimulation cough inhalation aerosolize concentrated salt-water solution . The objective protocol analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , airway epithelial cell , sputum specimen healthy volunteer patient acquire respiratory infection look difference immune function discover new pathway infectious disease susceptibility . We hypothesize study cellular response infection inflammatory marker release cell understanding human susceptibility respiratory tract infection . Five hundred fifty subject ( 250 healthy volunteer 300 patient ) undergo one following : 1 ) bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage , bronchial brushing , endobronchial biopsy ; 2 ) nasal mucosal scrape and/or brush biopsy ; 3 ) sputum induction obtain specimen vitro investigation comparison cellular acellular component .</detailed_description>
