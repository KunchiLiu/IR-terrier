	<brief_summary>Study focus femoral shaft ( thigh bone ) fracture ( break ) require surgical treatment anaesthetic stabilize femur fracture . This usually do placing metal nail screw inside femur ( thigh ) bone . This study design allow u learn effect use different start point insert nail body order access fracture fix . This question important date , entry point currently use result muscle damage . In order minimize damage lateral ( side ) entry nail develop currently use many centre . This nail new , lateral entry technique type fracture use extensively past , nail develop order well accommodate technique . It believe enter laterally instead go deep tissue access bone fix go result less muscle damage turn improve functional outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Outcome MRI Muscle Damage Following Nailing Procedure Femur ( Thigh ) Fractures Using Different Entry Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : This study design prospectively evaluate functional outcome MR image abductor damage follow antegrade femoral nail different entry point Recent development IM nail femur favour use great trochanter entry site oppose use `` classical '' piriformis fossa . With either technique , persistent problem appear however damage cause muscle tissue preparation femur insertion nail . The recent development femoral nail entry point lateral sit offer potential advantage avoid abductor muscle damage . In several cadaver study , author state trochanteric entry point cause damage piriformis entry , even lateral entry point cause even less damage abductor muscle compare classical piriformis fossa entry site . There however , prospective clinical study specifically evaluate condition abductor tendon amount muscle damage antegrade nailing treatment femoral shaft fracture . The clinical study attempt examine functional outcome patient undergo IM nail femoral fracture use general measurement tool ( general functional clinical assessment , gross evaluation gait ) reflect state art time specifically assess gluteal muscle condition . To date , publish study evaluate integrity gluteus tendon , damage surround tissue , functional outcome use validated score . Moreover , study compare `` traditional '' entry point lateral entry nail level precision . The standard care treatment femoral shaft fracture insertion intramedullary nail piriformis fossa . Following insertion femoral IM nail , number study demonstrate excellent clinical radiographic result relatively complication nonunion , malunion , infection . Intraoperative difficulty respect rapid identification appropriate start point prompt development nail use great trochanter entry site oppose use `` classical '' piriformis fossa . As state earlier , either technique , persistent problem appear however damage cause muscle tissue preparation femur insertion nail . The recent development femoral nail entry point lateral sit offer theoretical advantage avoid abductor muscle damage . There far lack prospective randomize trial demonstrate radiological clinical parameter different entry point . Objective To determine abductor tendon muscle damage MR-imaging accord entry point femoral nail . Additionally , objective hip muscle function , general health status functional outcome assess use validated instrument . We aim correlate muscle damage due different entry point correlate functional outcome . Further , quantify difference ( advantage ) different IM nail technique femur , respect effect abductor musculature , muscle test gait , patient-based functional outcome , guide surgeon ' decision future research . Recent Related Work In recently publish report Ricci et al . use trochanteric entry point associate low complication rate good clinical result include assessment gait video . In admittedly small prospective study superiority either trochanteric piriformis fossa entry point nail could establish . Although gait evaluate video ( 30 % study population ) , limited subjective assessment presence Trendelenberg gait ( absent , slight present ) . There statement muscle status , functional outcome assessment limit Harris Hip Score . Abductor tendon condition muscle damage previously assess MR-imaging group Pfirrmann et al . patient total hip arthroplasty transgluteal approach . This study show high correlation damage clinical outcome . The co-applicant 's research group previously carry many clinical study include part multi-centre randomized trial femur fracture . It also specifically carry functional assessment patient follow femur fracture include : objective muscle test isokinetic force use KinComÂ® dynamometer , formal gait lab analysis use eight camera real-time motion capture system conjunction force-plate walking platform , part study , administration validate self-assessment outcome questionnaire . So far prospective randomize trial investigate , plan , radiological ( MR ) , functional , clinical outcome insertion femoral nail two different entry point . Method Patients assign randomly ( via computer generate randomization ) one two group . The two group undergo standard treatment IM nail femoral shaft fracture differ entry point nail : piriformis fossa entry point versus lateral entry point . Design Patients 19 60 year age presenting isolated femoral shaft fracture require IM nail ask participate study . Informed consent participation study obtain either member health care team research nurse . Consenting patient meet inclusion criterion randomize either piriformis fossa lateral entry femoral nailing . Preoperative , Intraoperative , follow-up data obtain . Data detail clinical assessment , MRI result , objective muscle testing , gait analysis . Power analysis In publish report Pfirrmann et al . distinct conclusion could make collective 54 patient . We plan recruit 60 patient ( 30 per group ) project drop-out rate 10 % . As pilot study , without previous reference , similarity expect finding require sample size must infer . Cases randomize use web-based allocation tool . Outcome Variables : Variables collection analysis : 1 . Preoperative : ) Demographics ii ) ISS ( Injury Severity Score ) iii ) AO Fracture Classification 2 . Intraoperative : ) Elapsed time injury operative treatment ii ) Fluoroscopy time iii ) Incision length iv ) Blood loss 3 . Postoperative : ) VAS pain score ii ) Morphine requirement q 24hrs iii ) Change hemoglobin q 24hrs iv ) Hospital Length Stay v ) Clinical Radiological follow-up 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month vi ) MRI 12 month vii ) Self-administered validate outcome tool 6 12 month ( SF-36 , SMFA , Harris Hip Score , Merle d'Aubigne score ) although last two validate would allow comparison widely publish score establish literature Study Specific Measures : Postoperative follow-up : All patient review clinically fracture clinic two , six , twelve week , six twelve month postoperatively . Study data acquire six 12 month appointment . Clinical assessment : Bilateral measurement record result unaffected limb use control injured limb . Both raw data side side difference use analysis . Physical examination document limb length discrepancy , Trendelenberg sign , rotational malalignment , range motion hip knee . Questionnaires : A study specific questionnaire administer determine extent location persistent pain affect limb , ability return usual occupation recreational activity . Functional outcome score ( SF-36 , SMFA , Harris Hip Score , Merle d'Aubigne score ) collect 6 12 month . All outcomes tool widely reference literature use comparison purpose . MR Imaging : An MRI administer 12 month include evaluation abductor tendon defect , diameter , signal intensity , ossification , bursal fluid collection . The abductor muscle evaluate MRI fatty atrophy . Muscle strength test gait analysis : Muscle strength test take place 12 month utilize KinCom Dynamometer ( widely use , standard research protocol specifically-designed instrument use muscle strength test ) evaluate muscle strength : Peak isokinetic force measurement : maximum strength ( nm/kg ) , work ( J/min ) hip abductor , hip extensor , knee extensor . Gait analysis take place 12 month employ standard eight camera real-time motion capture system conjunction force-plate walking platform collect evaluate pelvic obliquity , hip abductor movement , single leg support time , step length . Data Analysis : The side-to-side difference summarize compare across treatment group . Additionally , aggregate raw data treatment group summarize compare , use t-test comparison continuous variable ' mean , Chi-square categorical data .</detailed_description>
