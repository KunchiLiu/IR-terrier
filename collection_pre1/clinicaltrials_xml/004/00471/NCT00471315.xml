	<brief_title>Duloxetine Patients With Suspected Functional Pancreatic/Biliary Pain ( Sphincter Oddi Dysfunction )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SOD disorder involve bile duct pancreas cause burn pain cramp epigastric ( upper stomach ) area radiate ( spread ) back right shoulder blade . This discomfort think cause tighten Sphincter Oddi , muscle opening control flow bile juice pancreas ( enzyme ) small intestine . It also cause contraction common bile duct ( duct allow bile liver small intestine ) . The purpose research study well medication call Duloxetine work use treat pain associate SOD . Duloxetine ( also call Cymbalta ) medication approve FDA treatment depression treatment pain cause nerve damage associate diabetes . However , purpose research , Duloxetine consider investigational ( experimental ) since test well medication work treatment pain associate SOD . ( Cymbalta replace Duloxetine remainder consent request ) . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ‚óè Treatment effect measure global assessment change ( PGIC ) 3 month treatment duloxetine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Toleration medication measure duloxetine compliance rate ; - Safety record adverse event ( AEs ) - Effect treatment pain reduction measure pain burden assessment tool ( RAPID 3 &amp; RAPID 1-Month ) ; - Effect treatment quality life ( QOL ) measure SF-36 .</detailed_description>
