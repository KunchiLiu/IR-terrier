	<brief_title>ABT-751 Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate safety efficacy ABT-751 patient androgen-independent , hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) optimal phase II dose drug patient . Secondary - Determine objective response rate ( partial complete response ) patient measurable disease treat drug . - Evaluate effect drug prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response patient nonmeasurable disease . - Determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - Determine survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral ABT-751 twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos ABT-751 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 50 additional patient may treat recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) dose level maximally administer dose . - Phase II : Patients receive ABT-751 MTD determine phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 53 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

Patients must prior treatment bilateral orchiectomy primary hormonal therapy ( e.g . LHRH therapy , estrogen , etc . ) evidence treatment failure simultaneous documentation castrate testosterone level ( &lt; 50 ng/dL ) NOTE : Patients undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue LHRH agonist therapy duration protocol unless medically contraindicate . For patient previously treat flutamide , nilutamide , bicalutamide : patient must discontinue flutamide nilutamide &gt; 4 week prior randomization ( &gt; 6 week bicalutamide ) evidence antiandrogen withdrawal response ( i.e . decline serum PSA and/or improvement baseline scan ) . Patients must receive prior therapy docetaxel alone combination either prednisone estramustine . This therapy may give neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting Patients must receive radiotherapy &lt; 3 week prior randomization . If patient receive prior radiotherapy evaluable lesion ( ) , must evidence radiographic progression prior entry . Patients must receive prior Strontium 89 , Samarium 153 , therapeutic radioisotope . Patients must recover systemic toxicity due prior treatment prostate cancer ( include incontinence , impotence , etc . secondary primary therapy ) The patient must ECOG Performance Status 01 The patient must adequate hematologic , renal hepatic function follow : 1 .
