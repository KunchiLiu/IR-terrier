	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Infusion Community-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) common approximately 20 percent episode pneumonia result hospitalization . It lead cause community-acquired infection require ICU admission.1 Especially elderly patient may severe illness high morbidity mortality rate . In pulmonary infection , release cytokine inflammatory mediator alveolar macrophage serve useful mechanism elimination invade pathogen . However , natural reaction potentially harmful excessive release circulate inflammatory cytokine cause damage patient , particularly lung . Interest role corticosteroid pathophysiology critical illness exist since early part 20th century . On ICU , early treatment corticosteroid attenuate systemic inflammation widespread . At time , outside ICU little evidence available effect treatment corticosteroid patient diagnosed CAP . Hypothetically , early initiate administration corticosteroid course CAP low systemic pulmonary inflammation . This may lead early resolution pneumonia reduction complication ( sepsis , mortality ) .</detailed_description>

Criteria determine communityacquired pneumonia : Chest radiograph show new opacity In combination two follow finding : Cough Production sputum Temp &gt; 38,0 °C &lt; 36,0 °C Audible abnormality chest examination compatible pneumonia Leukocytosis ( &gt; 10.000 cells/mm3 ) , leftward shift ( &gt; 10 % ) leukopenia ( &lt; 4000 cells/mm3 ) CRP &gt; 15 mg/dl ( three time upper limit normal ) The follow group exclude : Immunocompromised patient : Patients know congenital achieved immunodeficiency . Patients receive chemotherapy less 6 week ago . Patients receive corticosteroid last 6 week . Patients receive immunosuppressive medication last 6 week . ( like cyclosporine , cyclofosfamide , azathioprine ) Patients COPD systemic corticosteroid COPD . Patients require ICU treatment .</criteria>
