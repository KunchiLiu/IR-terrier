	<detailed_description>Evaluation Efficacy Safety Miltefosine Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Colombia Leishmaniasis take dramatic dimension Colombia , due rapid expansion , reemergence ( make Colombia become second South American country level annual incidence ) appearance new infection source , entrance vector home , urbanization disease , high population risk infection , absence adequate medication ( safe , non-expensive , easily available , oral topic route administration ) high resistance available medication treatment . It estimate 2005 20,000 new case diagnose ; 10,265 among Colombian military force personnel , well know rural area major proportion case diagnose people reach adequate treatment use empiric option . On hand , Program Research Control tropical disease ( PECET ) work among Tropical Diseases Research/World Health Organization ( TDR/WHO ) evaluation drug vaccine Leishmaniasis ; besides , PECET belong TDR/WHO Clinical Monitors group , TDR/WHO Data Management participate Initiative Public Health Products Development Doctorate among five Asiatic university . The Ministry Social Protection aware need new therapeutic alternative Leishmaniasis request PECET conduct control clinical trial determinate efficacy safety Miltefosine compare Glucantime treatment Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) Colombia , even though previous , conclusive trial , conduct Guatemala Colombia , demonstrate efficacy could alternative treatment country . Thermomed battery-operated medical device delivers precisely control localized current field radio frequency heat selectively destroy certain diseased tissue . Radio frequency energy direct handset applicator place direct contact lesion . ( applicator contain thermocouple continuously monitor control temperature within 50º Celsius . The thermomed use research treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis , recent clinical study show clinical improvement , also therapy elicit immune response disease . Through trial try perform conclusive clinical evaluation drug . In summary , project conduct clinical trial determine efficacy safety Miltefosine thermotherapy compare Glucantime treatment CL Colombian patient . Population CL remerging disease Colombia affect civilian military population well , share epidemiologic characteristic . The select population compose National Army Colombia soldier CL endemic area ( Caquetá , Meta , Guaviare , Putumayo , Córdoba , Antioquia Chocó ) . Treatment : In phase III , randomize open trial , subject meet inclusion criterion trial randomly allocate two group accord randomization list . One group treat 150 mg/day oral miltefosine 28 day second group treat thermotherapy device use one session 50 celsius degree 30 second third group treat intramuscular injection 20 mg/kg/day Glucantime® 20 day . A write instruction sheet give include patient , patient instruct contact research team appearance symptom suggest severe side effect ( intractable diarrhea and/or vomiting , symptom liver , kidney hematopoietic system dysfunction . Until six week termination treatment , patient receive oral miltefosine treates thermotherapy active lesion treat intramuscular Glucantime® injection ( 20mg/kg/day 20 day ) . Study development Schedule activity Screening ( -2 day 0 ) : Protocol explanation , invitation participate , inform consent signature , parasitological diagnosis ( Direct test ) , laboratory test ( Complete hemogram , Ureic Nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , amylase , Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ( GTP ALT ) , glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT AST ) ) . Inclusion ( Visit 1 ) : Randomization , sample Cultures , physical examination , vital sign measure , oral treatment initiation ( Miltefosine 28 day ) Glucantime® intramuscular application initiation ( 20 subsequent day ) thermotherapy ( Local heat ) , patient 's clinical record , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , lesion picture take . Visit 2 ( Middle treatment ) : Laboratory test ( Complete hemogram , BUN , creatinine , amylase , GOT , GPT ) , physical examination , vital sign measure , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , Lesions picture take . Visit 3 ( End treatment , +10 day ) : Laboratory test ( Complete hemogram , BUN , creatinine , amylase , GTP , GOT ) , physical examination , vital sign measure , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , lesion picture take , Evaluation treatment efficacy . Visit 4 ( Six week treatment , ± 15 day ) : Physical examination , Vital sign measure , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , lesion picture take , evaluation treatment efficacy . Visit 5 ( Three month treatment , ± 30 day ) : Physical examination , Vital sign measure , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , lesion picture take , evaluation treatment efficacy . Visit 6 ( Six month treatment , ± 40 day ) : Physical examination , Vital sign measure , CRF ( Case Report Format ) fulfilling , lesion picture take , evaluation treatment efficacy . Procedures : Physical examination A complete physical examination realize vital sign measure . Blood sample withdraw Blood sample withdraw antecubital vein perform follow analysis : - Creatinine Blood Urea Nitrogen . - Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) - Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) - Pancreatic amylase . - Complete hemogram . Technique sample culture The sample culture may obtain suction ulcer active edge phosphate-buffered saline solution ( PBS ) antibiotic ( 1000 UI crystalline Penicillin per cc ) , put culture medium . A tuberculin syringe 0.5 cc PBS solution antibiotic use suction technique . Previous asepsis ulcer alcohol 70 % , needle introduce dermis rotate movement small amount tissue macerate needle bevel minute , suction syringe . The sample deposit aseptic condition NNN culture medium incubate 26°C 4 week . The strain identify specie use monoclonal antibody . Toxicity The grade toxicity evaluate accord follow parameter : - Systemic : Fever , Headache . - Gastrointestinal : Nausea , vomit , oral discomfort . - Cardiovascular : cardiac rhythm , hypertension , hypotension . - Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia ( joint pain ) , myalgia , During treatment follow-up visit , patient ask adverse event . Each adverse event classify physician serious non-serious A serious adverse event meet one follow criterion : - Death - Life-threatening ( i.e. , immediate risk death ) - In-patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - Persistent significant disability/incapacity The presence serious adverse event put patient 's life risk and/or require immediate medical surgical procedure call discontinuation treatment initiation pertinent medical management patient . The study staff notify Adverse IEC/IRB University Antioquia serious adverse event within 24 hour knowledge . A non-serious adverse event classify follow : Mild : The patient aware symptom and/or sign , tolerable . They require medical intervention specific treatment . Moderate : Patients present trouble interfere daily activity . They require medical intervention specific treatment . Severe : The patient unable work attend daily activity . They require medical intervention specific treatment . The possible relationship adverse event test medication classify investigator basis his/her clinical judgment follow definition : Definitely relate : Event fully explain administration test medication . Probably related : Event likely explain administration test medication rather medication patient 's clinical state . Possibly relate : Event may explain administration test medication medication patient 's clinical state . Not relate : Event likely explain patient 's clinical state medication , rather test one . Data analysis phase . The heal rate calculate accord group ( treatment control ) intention treat protocol . Subgroups establish depend clinical response , adverse event accord Leishmania specie . Besides , characteristic lesion ( size , localization , type lesion ) , demographic characteristic long heal take treatment settle . In case significance test perform compare treatment . Endpoints Primary Clinical response : Complete re-epithelization lesion disappearance induration ( without scar ) . No parasitological evaluation do clinically cured lesion determine 45 day posttreatment . Clinical improvement : Reduction ≥50 % area induration ulcer compare immediately previous evaluation . Secondary : Treatment failure : No change increase size induration ulcer . Absence clinical response : Induration ulcer area ≤50 % compare immediately previous evaluation .
