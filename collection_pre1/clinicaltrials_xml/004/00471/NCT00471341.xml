	<brief_summary>This study involve drug call celecoxib , commonly prescribed people arthritis . Arthritis cause inflammation joint tissue . Inflammation also occur blood vessel lead heart , purpose study see celecoxib reduce blood vessel inflammation associate high cholesterol heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Celecoxib Markers Vascular Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammation blood vessel wall hallmark atherosclerosis . Elevated level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , well blood pressure know proinflammatory . Recent information suggest acute ischemic event associate exacerbation inflammation . Some data suggest aspirin use associate suppression marker inflammation , response link improved outcome . Similarly , HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitor clearly reduce adverse outcome patient atherosclerosis recently , HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitor use also link reduction inflammation . Due strong association atherogenesis plaque stability inflammation , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , marker inflammation , evaluate potential tool clinician assess cardiovascular risk , find highly correlate . There also evidence suggest cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) enzyme express plaque region vulnerable rupture . Accordingly , study design investigate potential reduction vascular inflammation specific COX-2 inhibitor , celecoxib , measure reduction baseline CRP , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . This double blind , placebo control pilot study hypertensive patient coronary artery disease dyslipidemia , evaluate effect celecoxib versus placebo inflammatory marker . Patients receive study drug three month .</detailed_description>
