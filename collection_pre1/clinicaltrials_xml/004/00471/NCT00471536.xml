	<brief_title>Pazopanib Treating Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess anti tumor activity toxicity profile pazopanib hydrochloride patient metastatic urothelial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate pharmacokinetics pazopanib hydrochloride patient . II . Evaluate pre- post-treatment change circulate endothelial cell , monocyte platelet , angiogenesis-related factor patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically correlative study pharmacological study . Samples analyze vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) soluble VEGF receptor II concentration via ELISA . Circulating endothelial cell also measure . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
