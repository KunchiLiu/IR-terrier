	<brief_summary>High blood pressure important risk factor disease heart blood vessel like myocardial infarction stroke . Many patient treat target blood pressure , even though good blood pressure lower drug available . Not blood pressure drug equally effective individual patient . We hypothesize individual patient characteristic predict best response different blood pressure lower drug . In study investigate whether set patient characteristic ( anthropometric laboratory ) obtain treatment may predict blood pressure lower response representative two group drug : inhibit renin-angiotensin system activity decrease blood volume .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Population-wide elimination hypertension would reduce incidence stroke , MI heart failure 30 50 % contribute reduction 25 50 % total mortality relate cardiovascular condition . However , despite increase number antihypertensive medication prescription , hypertension control rate still insufficient . The current study focus improve success rate initial treatment hypertension . The individual response antihypertensive drug varies individual : many patient respond well one drug respond poorly another . We hypothesize difference response depend presence certain characteristic patient , like waist circumference , age gender . The major objective study identify patient characteristic predict efficacy different class antihypertensive drug . Despite pleas international publication tailor antihypertensive treatment individual basis , patient characteristic take account medical treatment hypertension . We address study objective use PRospective , Open label ( medication blind ) , Blinded End-point crossover design ( PROBE ) 100 general practice base , newly diagnose hypertensive patient , age 18 - 65 year include treated diuretic angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) . Each patient treat standard dos medication consecutively . Treatment duration medication four week , four week washout period . The choice diuretic versus ARB base substantial difference work mechanism represent two major determinant blood pressure : effect intravascular volume ( diuretic ) vascular tone ( ARB ) . Blood pressure assess 24 hour-monitoring practice base standardized measurement . Twenty-three different patient characteristic study select base review literature pathophysiologic theory . These characteristic ( 1 ) simple anthropometric measure like body mass index fat distribution , ( 2 ) demographic characteristic , gender ethnicity ( 3 ) disease characteristic baseline diastolic systolic blood pressure , co-morbidity blood plasma level easily measure bioactive compound , like renin B-type natriuretic peptide . The primary outcome measure difference blood pressure response study drug ; secondary outcome measure difference number patient achieve target blood pressure number adverse drug event . We expect find three six significant patient characteristic predict response antihypertensive medication term blood pressure reduction . If study indeed identifies relevant patient characteristic GPs able initiate antihypertensive medical treatment efficiently . We expect result increase initial therapeutic success reduction number antihypertensive drug need . As consequence expect compliance hypertension control rate increase . These expectation need confirm general practice-based follow-up study implementation daily practice use patient characteristic compliance hypertension control rate outcome measure .</detailed_description>
