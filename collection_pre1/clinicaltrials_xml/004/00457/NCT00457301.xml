	<brief_summary>The objective study assess effect use HRQL measure clinical care pre- post-lung transplant patient . The hypothesis inclusion HRQL measure , Health Utilities Index System Mark 2 ( HUI2 ) Mark 3 ( HUI3 ) , routine clinical care pre- post-lung transplant patient , : 1 ) improve patient-clinician communication ; 2 ) affect patient management ; 3 ) improve patient ' HRQL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Health-related Quality Life ( HRQL ) Routine Clinical Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently increase interest use health-related quality life ( HRQL ) measure routine clinical practice . Traditionally , patient care base laboratory result , medical history , sign symptom diagnose clinician . The inclusion HRQL measure routine practice may provide important often otherwise miss information , reveal impact disease treatment patient 's physical , emotional social well-being , may assist patient management . HRQL assessment may assist change medical paradigm disease-centered approach patient-centered one . Several study mental health oncology discus application HRQL measure clinical practice . Taenzer et al ( 2000 ) Detmar et al . ( 2002 ) provide evidence use HRQL measure improve patient-clinician communication . Velikova et al ( 2004 ) detect impact communication emotional well-being patient . Using framework base previous study method health technology assessment diagnostic technology ( Guyatt et al . 1986 ) , assess effect include HRQL assessment routine clinical care patient undergo solid organ transplantation ( lung ) . We expect routine use HRQL measure clinical practice affect patient-clinician communication , patient management , patient outcome . Lung transplantation trade fatal disease ( end-stage pulmonary disease ) chance prolong survival improve quality life , albeit immunosuppression . In context , generic preference-based measure HUI2 HUI3 prefer specific measure , measure broad range health dimension , include pain , ambulation emotional issue expect relevant . Preference-based measure provide score conventional 0.00 ( dead ) 1.00 ( perfect health ) scale allow integration morbidity mortality effect calculation quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) health-adjusted life expectancy ( HALE ) .</detailed_description>
