	<brief_title>Comparing Two Pneumococcal Vaccines Adults With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals infect Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria may develop pneumococcal disease , serious disease kill people United States vaccine-preventable disease combine . Individuals COPD , characterize breathing difficulty due damage obstructed lung airway , may increase risk develop serious complication pneumococcal disease , include pneumonia meningitis . Currently , two type pneumococcal vaccine available . The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide ( CPS ) vaccine , know Pneumovax , typically give adult 65 year age old individual serious health condition , include heart disease , lung disease , diabetes . The diphtheria protein-conjugated vaccine ( PCV7 ) , know Prevnar , typically give infant ; however , adult receive vaccine may also favorable response . The purpose study compare immune response Pneumovax Prevnar vaccine adult COPD . This study enroll adult mild moderate COPD . Participants randomly assign receive either Pneumovax Prevnar vaccine . This involve one two injection . Blood collection occur study visit Months 1 , 12 , 24 . Study researcher contact participant telephone Months 6 18 document pneumococcal infection additional pneumococcal vaccination .</detailed_description>
