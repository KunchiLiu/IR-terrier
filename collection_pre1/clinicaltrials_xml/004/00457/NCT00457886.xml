	<brief_title>Measurement Hormone Levels Patients Receiving 17-HPC Preterm Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent study Meis colleague publish New England Journal Medicine June 2003 demonstrate 33 % reduction rate preterm delivery patient previous history preterm delivery use weekly 17-P injection subsequent pregnancy . This milestone prevention preterm delivery reason choose receive treatment 17-P . However , 17-P work prevent preterm delivery unclear . Knowledge mechanism action 17-P would help select patient treatment may useful monitor efficacy therapy . Studies suggest time delivery depend type placental clock , affected level corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) progesterone ( P ) . CRH think act accelerator , P brake . Serial injection 17-P begin second trim pregnancy may prevent preterm delivery maintain progesterone dominance , reflect increased level progesterone and/or 17-P , decreased level cortisol and/or CRH . These hormone measure study . Results study important whatever outcome . If measurable change hormone measure , important know investigation marker pursue . If measurable change hormone measure , pilot study could serve support large definitive study , could lead valuable information relate practical use 17-P prevention preterm delivery .</detailed_description>
