	<brief_title>A Study Designed Evaluate ODSH Subjects With Exacerbations COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management acute exacerbation COPD today qualitatively 40 year ago : bronchodilator , corticosteroid , antibiotic . Because prominent pathophysiological role neutrophil exacerbation COPD , neutrophils toxic oxidant proteases represent therapeutic target currently unchallenged treatment aspect disease . Ideally , disrupt neutrophilic airway inflammation , one would block neutrophilic influx vascular space airway , well neutralize inactivate prominent neutrophilic toxin protease HLE cathepsin G. Heparin sulfate mucopolysaccharide slows blood clot formation inhibit reaction lead formation fibrin clot . Physicians use heparin prevent blood clot formation open-heart surgery , bypass surgery dialysis . Heparin also prevent previously form clot become large cause serious problem . Heparin biological property , notably anti-inflammatory activity . At dos require therapeutically beneficial anti-inflammatory , heparin cause severe , potentially life-threatening hemorrhage . ParinGenix chemically modify heparin retain anti-inflammatory activity reduce anti-coagulant property . Heparin long known potent inhibitor , vitro vivo , cationic neutrophil protease HLE cathepsin G. However , heparin also numerous important anti-inflammatory effect . P-selectin primary endothelial attachment molecule mediate neutrophil roll along vessel wall . At concentration close achieve plasma near high range therapeutic anticoagulation , heparin inhibits P-selectin P-selectin mediate interaction leukocyte endothelium . Heparin also block leukocyte integrin Mac-1 ( CD11b/CD18 ) Mac-1-dependent leukocyte adherence endothelial ICAM . These combined effect roll , integrin-dependent attachment perhaps aspects cellular passage basement membrane prevent neutrophil accumulation area inflammation . As example , give much high concentration appropriate therapeutic anticoagulation , heparin efficiently block neutrophilic influx ischemic reperfused myocardium brain reduce size myocardial infarction ischemic stroke . Thus , heparin heparin analogue may potential also reduce inflammatory influx neutrophil airway exacerbation COPD . All subject receive standard care treatment , include corticosteroid , beta-2 agonist , antibiotic well ODSH placebo .</detailed_description>
