	<brief_summary>Many patient Multiple Sclerosis experience pain cause effect MS nervous system . The purpose study see investigational drug ( Duloxetine ) reduce pain subject MS . The US Food Drug administration ( FDA ) approve drug use depression pain diabetes.However , consider investigational study approve patient MS . This study recruit patient MS central pain 4 great scale 1-10 . Patients must experience pain 2 month longer prior begin study.The study last 10 week , patient randomize either Duloxetine placebo carefully monitor throughout study . Patients keep pain/sleep diary study period provide Ibuprofen pain control .</brief_summary>

Pain important symptom MS , report 44 % 80 % patient . Duloxetine FDA approve use treatment diabetic painful neuropathy depression . Since analgesic mechanism action Duloxetine believe occur Central Nervous System , reason believe may also effective central pain condition , MS. Our study design include 1:1 randomization Duloxetine placebo . We hypothesize Duloxetine group experience reduction weekly 24 hour average bad pain score exceed 1.5 significantly great reduction achieve placebo group .

	<criteria>Diagnosis MS make least 3 month prior base McDonald Proser criterion . Age 17 . Clinical stability define MS exacerbation change disease modify therapy 90 day prior screen . Daily pain attribute MS , present minimum 2 month prior screen . Minimum baseline score 4 24h Worst Pain Score rat 11 point ( 010 ) point Likert Scale within identify region central pain . Pain could clearly differentiate cause Multiple Sclerosis , diabetic neuropathy , PVD , arthritis musculoskeletal condition , chronic headache , visceral pain . Transient pain dysesthetic L'Hermittes sign alone . Current historical diagnosis mania , bipolar disorder psychosis . Concomitant use monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) thioridazine . ( MAOI drug must discontinue 14 day prior enrollment . At least 5 day must pass study drug discontinuation MAOI drug may start . ) Concomitant use serotonin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine duloxetine within 4 week baseline . Use analgesic medication except ibuprofen neurogenic pain 7 day prior baseline visit study termination . Use opioid , marijuana dronabinol within 7 day baseline . Narrow angle glaucoma . Depression suicidality . Substantial alcohol use . Because possible Duloxetine alcohol interact cause liver injury , duloxetine prescribe patient substantial alcohol use . Potential subject ask much alcohol drink . If answer 2 drink day generally constitute exclusion . History chronic hepatic insufficiency ALT AST &gt; twice upper limit normal . Because possible thast Duloxetine may aggravate pre exisitng liver disease , duloxetine prescribe patient chronic liver disease . Renal insufficiency ( Creatinine Clearance , 30mL/minor serum creatinine &gt; 1.9 ) . Duloxetine recommend patient end stage renal disease ( require dialysis ) severe renal impairment . Population PK analyse suggest mild moderate degree renal dysfunction ( estimate CrCl 3080ml/min ) significant effect Duloxetine clearance . We calculate creatinine clearance use CockcroftGault calculation . This common calculation use FDA producy labeling : Males= ( 140age ) ( wt kg ) ( serum creatinine ) ( 72 ) . Females= malesx 0.85 . Uncontrolled hypertention ( SBP &gt; 180 , DBP &gt; 105 ) Females breast feeding , pregnant , potential become pregnant course study . ( fertile unwilling/unable use effective contraceptive measure ) Any serious and/or unstable medical condition . Allergy ibuprofen non steroidal anti inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) Any history peptic ulcer disease within 2 year lifetime history NSAIDassociated gastritis toxicity . Patients take low dose aspirin instruct contact primary physicianto ask whether may safely discontinue aspirin participate study . If recommendation continue aspirin use aspirin secondary prevention arteriosclerotic disease , exclude .</criteria>
