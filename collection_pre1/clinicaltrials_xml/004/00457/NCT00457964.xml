	<brief_title>RAD001 Therapy Angiomyolipomata Patients With TS Complex Sporadic LAM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex genetic disorder birth incidence approximately one six thousand . Angiomyolipomas occur eighty percent person TS , 60 % person LAM . They fatty tumor often occur kidney liver well part body . They grow cause damage surround kidney tissue even renal failure . They may also leak blood cause potentially life-threatening hemorrhage . Laboratory study show RAD001 suppress chemical cause tumor grow tuberous sclerosis sporadic LAM . The primary goal study evaluate clinical effectiveness RAD001 24 month trial . Although primary goal determine drug RAD001 effect angiomyolipomas , disease associate tuberous sclerosis monitor , specifically change involvement brain lung tuberous sclerosis . The use RAD001 treat angiomyolipomas tuberous sclerosis sporadic LAM consider experimental</detailed_description>
