	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial myopathy include various inherited disease cause damage mitochondrion , energy-producing structure fuel body 's process . The main symptom muscle weakness , reduce muscle mass , difficulty exercise . The purpose study determine effect exercise train versus inactivity mitochondrial function muscle muscle performance people mitochondrial myopathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Exercise Versus Inactivity People With Mitochondrial Muscle Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mitochondrial myopathy cause mutant mitochondrial DNA , genetic defect part mitochondrial DNA . These defect include miss delete DNA typically cod certain protein involve energy production . These mutation cause individual mitochondrion body whole produce energy less efficiently . Because muscle cell require extensive energy function properly , particularly impaired mitochondrial dysfunction . The onset mitochondrial myopathy occur age 20 . Initially person may experience muscle weakness fatigue physical activity . Other symptom may include limited eye mobility , heart arrhythmia , slur speech , swallow difficulty , impaired movement . There cure yet mitochondrial myopathy , adequate treatment stall disease progression . Exercise , know boost production function mitochondrion healthy people , may reduce symptom people mitochondrial myopathy increase number function normal mitochondrion individual muscle cell . The purpose study determine effect exercise train versus inactivity expression normal mutant mitochondrial DNA mitochondrial production within muscle cell people mitochondrial myopathy . The study also assess cell function , physical endurance , heart function , quality life affect exercise training inactivity . Participants 2-year study first undergo physiological exercise testing , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart skeletal muscle , needle biopsy muscle , questionnaire quality life . Participants randomly assign partake regular exercise training train 6 month . After 6 month , participant undergo repeat test initial evaluation . Participants exercise group switch exercise train 6 month , participant non-exercising group switch regular exercise training 6 month . The second 6-month period also follow repeat test initial evaluation . Participants encourage continue exercise training additional 1 year , retesting end second year . Each four evaluation take 15 hour 5 day .</detailed_description>
