	<brief_summary>Context : The many treatment device develop unload diseased articular surface knee osteoarthritis provide limited solution . A novel biomechanical device comprise four individually calibrated element attach onto foot-worn platform recently develop . This device capable unload stand walking , simultaneously strengthen dynamic stabilizer train neuromuscular control control biomechanical perturbation . Objective : To asses effectiveness device reduce pain improve function patient knee osteoarthritis . Design Setting : Randomized , control double blind prospective trial , conduct September 2005 February 2006 , Department Orthopedics , Asaf Harofeh Medical Center ( Zerifin , Israel ) . Patients : Sixty-one patient diagnose knee osteoarthritis self-reported moderate-to-severe level pain . Interventions : Patients randomly assign active control group undergo 8 week treatment . The active group treat device four biomechanical element individually calibrate accommodate pain-free joint alignment . The control group treat device ’ platform without biomechanical element . Primary Outcome Measures : The patient evaluate three time study : baseline , 4 week 8 week endpoint . Primary outcome Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Aggregated Locomotor Function ( ALF ) assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Biomechanical System The biomechanical system biomechanical device ( US Patent No . 6,979,287 ) combine treatment methodology ( US Patent No . 7,101,330 ) . The device calibrate individual patient accord pathology motion characteristic . Appropriate calibration define bring damage joint biomechanical alignment minimizes/eliminates pain shift and/or change applied force , consequently , alter pressure distribution within joint . Together biomechanical perturbation apply phase step-cycle ( i.e . initial contact , mid-stance toe-off ) , enable home-based , dynamic , functional repetitive training strengthen dynamic stabilizer improve neuromuscular control . The device consist two half spherical-shaped biomechanical element attach patient ’ foot . One locate hindfoot region locate forefoot region . The element available different degree resilience convexity , attach patient ’ foot use platform form shoe . The platform equip specially design sole , consist two mount rail enable flexible positioning element region . A specific level “ unload ” specific level perturbation require control pain affect compartment reduce excessive load soft tissue structure . Primary guideline calibration dictate choice resilience , convexity position element . For example , genu-varus deformity element position neutral axis patient ’ leg . The element hindfoot translate laterally longitudinal axis patient ’ leg order apply wedging , element forefoot translate medially reduce tension apply soft tissue medial compartment , decrease adduction moment . When require , soft tissue tension and/or pressure decrease add plantar flexion and/or forward translation hindfoot element . Pain motion instability periodically evaluate determine whether recalibration require . Treatment ( Active ) Protocol The device calibrate patient baseline assessment . Then , treatment initiate continued daily period 8 week , device calibrate , necessary , first , third sixth week . Patients instruct follow treatment protocol base walking activity daily live start 10 minute indoor walk day first week gradually increase 30 minute daily outdoor walk last week . Other , tell continue daily activity wear regular footwear . They also instruct ingest pain relief medication , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug food supplement except acetaminophen tablet ( unmarked ) give study entry take need . The consumption acetaminophen medication monitor assessment . Control Protocol Patients control group fit platform identical appearance regular sole include biomechanical element . They instruct follow treatment protocol active group ingest medication food supplement apart unmarked acetaminophen tablet give . Assessment We test clinical efficacy device design reduce pain improve function knee osteoarthritis patient mean self-reported Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) measure aggregated locomotor function ( ALF ) . The WOMAC compose 5 item pain scale , 2 item stiffness scale 17 item function scale . All 24 item rat patient visual-analogue-scale ( cm ) 0 ( symptoms/limitations ) 10 ( maximal symptoms/limitations ) . The ALF scale sum mean time score ( second ) three locomotor function : time take walk 8 meter , time take accent decent 7 stairs time take transfer sit stand . The patient evaluate three time study : baseline , 4 week 8 week endpoint . Measurements make patient barefooted required outcome protocol . To ensure ability detect clinically significant difference , also use SF-36 health survey Knee Society Score self-reported secondary outcome ( latter include physical examination subscale ) .</detailed_description>
