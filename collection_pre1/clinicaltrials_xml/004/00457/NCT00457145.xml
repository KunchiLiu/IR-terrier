	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug ranibizumab effective treatment macular telangiectasia , condition exist blood vessel near macula ( back part eye responsible sharp central vision ) become dilate twisted , new abnormal blood vessel may form retina . Both exist dilate vessel , well new subretinal vessel leak fluid blood , distort retina , affect vision . This study see ranibizumab slow stop leakage growth exist , dilate , macular vessel case new vessel formation retina absent . Patients 18 year age old macular telangiectasia without new blood vessel formation may eligible study . Visual acuity must 20/40 worse . Participants receive least four injection ranibizumab eye 12-week period . After fourth injection , additional injection may give every 4 week 1 year doctor determines may benefit . In addition ranibizumab treatment , patient undergo follow procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Eye examination , include dilation pupil measurement fluid pressure eye . - Fluorescein angiogram : A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Photographs retina take special camera flash blue light eye . The photo show whether dye leak vessel retina . - Indocyanine green angiography : This procedure identify feeder vessel may supply abnormal blood vessel . The test similar fluorescein angiography , use green dye flash invisible light . - Autofluorescence imaging : This test examine well retina function . The back eye photograph bright light . - Optical coherence tomography : This test measure retinal thickness . A light shin eye produce cross-sectional picture retina . The measurement repeat study determine retinal thicken get good worse , stay . - Stereoscopic color fundus photography : The pupil dilate special photograph inside eye take evaluate retina measure change occur time . The camera flash bright light eye picture . - Follow-up visit : The doctor evaluate effect study treatment injection . Patients contact phone 3 day injection check treatment side effect . A final follow-up visit schedule 8 week last treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Injected Ranibizumab Treat Macular Telangiectasia Without New Blood Vessel Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal telangiectasis group rare , idiopathic retinal vascular anomaly affect retinal capillary irregular capillary dilation incompetence occur macula . This former group 2 Gass classification idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia fluorescein angiography show leakage capillary dilation . These patient typically diagnose fifth sixth decade life . Both sex may affect . Minimal exudation , superficial retinal crystalline deposit , right-angle venule characterize disorder . As disease progress , intraretinal pigment plaque eventually subretinal/choroidal neovascularization develop . Currently , patient classify macular telangiectasia . The pathogenesis disease unknown . Because leakage retinal vessel also find neovascularization , possible vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) may implicate disease . The purpose study evaluate possible role ranibizumab treatment five participant macular telangiectasia hyperfluorescence fluorescein angiography , vision decrease 20/40 bad , without neovascularization . The primary outcome visual acuity change , either increase decrease 15 letter one year . The secondary outcome measure one year include visual acuity change 10 letter , change retinal thickening document OCT , extent degree fluorescein leakage , change area hypofluorescence , change central retinal sensitivity . This pilot study design evaluate feasibility potential efficacy treat patient macular telangiectasia large , phase III study within organization MAC TEL Research Group , sponsor Lowy Foundation . Currently , research group enrol 200 patient affected condition natural history study 22 international clinical center .</detailed_description>
