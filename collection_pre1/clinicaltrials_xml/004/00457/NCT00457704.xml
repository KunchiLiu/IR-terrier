	<brief_summary>Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) one principal multidrug resistant organism find hospital world , recently emerge community . However , moment ( 2002 ) , hospital remain principal reservoir MRSA far patient discharge MRSA carriage source MRSA spread community . In particular patient admit home care ( HC ) acute care facility represent patient group high risk MRSA carriage source MRSA spread community . The objective study determine whether HC patient effectively MRSA reservoir source MRSA spread community . For , February 2003 March 2004 adult patient ( except obstetric patient ) ( approximately 3360 patient 16 HC setting ) , screen [ nasal skin lesion ( ) swab ] MRSA carriage within 48 h his/her transfer . The patient find MRSA carrier visit physician ask patient well family member participate study . Each patient family member give agreement participate , sample ( nasal swab patient family member , skin lesion swab patient skin lesion ) every month 12 month nurse HC set patient admit . As soon patient discharge HC set 12 month survey finish , patient family member swab sample perform nurse research team ( NRT ) every 3 month end survey period . These swab transmit NRT research center analyze microbial technician research center . The bacteriological survey accompany epidemiological survey order determine risk factor long term MRSA carriage patient admit HC also risk factor transmit MRSA family . This multi-centre multi-investigator study perform period 32 month ( 1 month prepare study , 13 month screen patient regard MRSA carriage transfer acute care setting HC setting , 12 month survey HC patient family member 6 month analyze data prepare publication ) . Such study provide u descriptive quantitative data MRSA strain introduce community HC patient . From analysis risk factor MRSA transmission patient family member , suggestion limit transmission might draw .</brief_summary>
