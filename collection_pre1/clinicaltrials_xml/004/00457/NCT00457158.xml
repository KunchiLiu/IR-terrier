	<brief_title>PREPIC 2 : Prevention Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism Vena Cava Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism common pathology , could fatal ( 10 000 death/year France ) . It mainly originate deep vein thrombosis . In order reduce mortality , prevention new recurrent PE major therapeutic aim . Only one randomise trial ( PREPIC ) assess interest vena cava filter patient treat anticoagulant treatment deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . Results show significant 50 % reduction embolic risk filter . This benefit occur first day , counterbalance long-term increase risk recurrent DVT . The filter appear promising patient high risk PE , exemple elderly , present thromboembolic history , cancer , heart failure respiratory insufficiency , recent PE . Moreover , retrievable filter , may either left place permanently retrieve day week , could limit filter thrombosis risk . The aim PREPIC 2 study ass , multicenter randomise trial , efficacy safety retrievable vena cava filter implant 3 month versus filter 400 patient treat anticoagulant drug symptomatic PE associate least one thrombotic risk factor . A clinical follow-up perform 6 month . The primary outcome incidence recurrent PE 3 month , include symptomatic fatal PE . It adjudicate independent committee , blind patient ' allocation . This study ass benefit risk ratio retrievable filter prevention recurrent PE , without increase thrombotic risk disadvantage due post thrombotic syndrome .</detailed_description>
