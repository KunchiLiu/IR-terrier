	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Glargine Detemir Insulin Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Todate , study compare insulin detemir glargine NPH . Depending design , study show insulin lower fast glucose , A1c , incidence hypoglycemia associate less weight gain NPH . In direct comparison study two basal insulin , insulin detemir demonstrate significantly less day day variation glargine measure glucose infusion rat euglycemic clamp study . Given incidence hypoglycemia , last study would suggest insulin detemir treatment could achieve target glucose control glargine . We use continuous glucose monitoring ( CGMS ) extensively practice . CGMS arguably sensitive method detect difference glycemic control outpatient set allow fine adjustment insulin treatment . When compare insulin glargine preprogrammable basal insulin deliver continuous subcutaneous infusion use CGMS , show significantly well glucose control continuous subcutaneous infusion , We also develop method daily insulin dosage adjustment continuous CGMS study daily glucose tracing download . This allow even accurate basal insulin replacement per set glycemic goal . This protocol address comparison insulin glargine insulin detemir patient evaluate CGMS .</detailed_description>
