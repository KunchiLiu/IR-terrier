	<brief_title>Identifying Genetic Characteristics That Increase Risk Developing Primary Graft Dysfunction Following Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PGD severe complication affect 25 % lung transplant patient follow surgery . Pulmonary edema , abnormal build-up fluid lung , hypoxemia , low blood oxygen level , two common symptom individual PGD experience . Treatment condition often expensive , leading cause death follow lung transplant . Many potential donor recipient consider unsuitable lung transplant concern development PGD . Therefore , ability accurately predict individual risk develop PGD may allow lung transplant perform . Specific characteristic lung donor recipient may play important role determine risk PGD . For example , genetic variation body deal harmful chemical call oxidant may associate development PGD . The purpose study identify specific genetic biomarkers donor recipient put individual risk develop PGD follow lung transplant . This study enroll individual undergo lung transplantation . Blood sample collect lung donor participant prior surgery , immediately follow surgery , 24 hour surgery . Study researcher monitor participant 72 hour follow surgery symptom PGD . There additional study visit .</detailed_description>
