	<brief_summary>The purpose study find part brain increase decreased activity individual bipolar disorder medicine change activity bipolar subject . Another purpose study compare data obtain bipolar depressed subject data obtain healthy subject . In study measure activity different part brain , participant see picture , use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan . We two MRI scan subject treatment eight week standard bipolar disorder medication call lithium .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Connectivity Mood Regulating Circuit In Bipolar Depression Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Our first aim use novel fMRI experimental paradigm investigate pathophysiology bipolar disorder ( BD ) term strength connectivity ( measure LFBF correlation ) different emotion regulate area brain rather term increase decrease localized brain activity . Specific Aim 2 : Our second aim investigate whether lithium work alter connectivity area brain implicate pathophysiology BD , thereby leading change abnormal positive negative emotional reaction environment see mania depression respectively . Specific Aim 3 : Out third aim investigate whether patient s/s s/L allele 5-HTTLPR polymorphism great amygdalar activation decrease cortico-amygdala connectivity compare patient L/L genotype . We also investigate whether lithium treatment differentially affect fMRI measure s/s s/L L/L genotype . Methods : We study unmedicated subject satisfy DSM-IV criterion Bipolar Disorder current episode depress hypomanic/manic euthymic . Subjects undergo fMRI 8 week treatment lithium mood stabilizer know effective phase BD . Healthy subject scan baseline 8 week treat medication . We also test serotonin transporter gene ( gene control availability chemical call serotonin brain ) , show effect lithium work .</detailed_description>
