	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm renal cell cancer component clear cell carcinoma evidence metastasis ( pure sarcomatoid variant cancer collect duct malignancy exclude ) . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one target lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 2 time slice width spiral CT scan ( i.e . 10 mm CT slice width 5 mm , 14 mm CT slice width 7 mm ) . 3 . Patients must previously receive currently receive sunitinib malate ( Sutent ) evidence disease progression receive sunitinib malate ( evident new lesion CT/MRI/bone scan unequivocal growth measurable tumor lesion ) . Note : Patients stratify : A : Patients previously treat sunitinib malate . At least 4 week washout since last treatment administer required patient eligible study . Once patient meet eligibility criterion , treat Panzem® NCD alone . B : Patients currently still sunitinib . Patients continue receive current dose/schedule sunitinib . Once eligibility determine , patient start Panzem® NCD concurrently sunitinib . No drug washout sunitinib malate require stratification . Note : Enrollment individual stratification stop stratification meet accrual goal . 4 . Age great equal 18 year . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . ECOG performance status 02 ( see Appendix A ) . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,200/μL hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dl ( patient may transfuse level ) platelets great equal 100,000/μL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal 8 . Adequate cardiac function history . If patient history cardiac disease ( prior myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , etc . ) , normal echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan require ( LVEF great equal institutional low limit normal ) . 9 . No evidence uncontrolled hypertension document 2 baseline blood pressure read take least 1 hour apart . The systolic blood pressure must less equal 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure less equal 90 mmHg . Patients allow antihypertensive medication . 10 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , cytokine therapy experimental therapy permit within 4 week treatment initiation . Patients must recover baseline grade 1 clinically significant adverse event experience prior therapy . 2 . Patients may concurrently receive investigational agent participate study . 3 . Patients active brain metastasis exclude . Previously treat brain metastasis allow provided patient clinically stable ( systemic steroid antiepileptic agent ) repeat image study ( within 4 week registration ) brain confirm stable CNS disease . Patients know CNS carcinomatosis leptomeningeal spread disease exclude study due poor prognosis . 4 . Patients gastrointestinal abnormality include inability take oral medication , requirement intravenous alimentation , malabsorption syndrome exclude . 5 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Patients type I insulindependent diabetes poorlycontrolled type II insulindependent diabetes fast blood glucose 10 mmol/L ( 200 mg/dL ) exclude due difficulty evaluate tumor metabolic activity use FDGPET . 8 . History myocardial infarction hospitalization congestive heart failure within 12 month enrollment . 9 . History prior malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma resect curative intent ) unless resect treated curative intent , disease free great equal 5 year .</criteria>
