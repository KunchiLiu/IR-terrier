SELECTION CRITERIA Total Number Patients Target Population The plan total sample size study 40 patient . Patients potentially resectable metastatic colorectal cancer previously untreated metastatic disease enrol trial . STUDY DESIGN Design This single arm , multicenter Phase I/II trial evaluate Resectability ( R0 ) rate neoadjuvant Bevacizumab combination biweekly regime capecitabine plus oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) potentially resectable mCRC . The pre-operative treatment phase consist 6 cycle XELOX 5 cycle Bevacizumab . The cycle duration 2 week . Surgery perform 2 week last administration Capecitabine , allow time window 5 week last dose Bevacizumab surgery . The post-operative treatment phase consist 6 cycle XELOX + Bevacizumab re-started 4-5 week surgery . Patients follow tumour progression survival 2 year last patient enrol trial ( end study follow ) . Schedule Assessment Study Procedures Study assessment procedure perform show Table 1 2 . Screening Baseline Written inform consent must obtain prior patient undergo study-specific procedure . 1 . Tumor assessment : abdominal pelvic CT / MRI chest CT / MRI may obtain 4 week prior enrollment . 2 . Assessments make 14 day enrollment include : demographic data , medical history , cancer/treatment history , concomitant disease/treatment , physical examination ( include basic neurologic exam investigator ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) CEA , CA 19-9 determination . 3 . Assessments make within 7 day enrollment : height , weight , vital sign ( body temperature , blood pressure , pulse/heart rate ) , ECOG Performance Status , hematology , blood chemistry ( include creatinine clearance calculation ) , INR &amp; aPTT , serum pregnancy test ( woman less 2 year amenorrheic ) , dipstick urinalysis proteinuria , 24-hour urine collection determination total protein ( necessary ) . 4 . Urine pregnancy test require prior first administration study treatment 7 day elapse baseline serum pregnancy test . If Central Venous Access Device ( CVAD ) require , least 2-day interval placement central line first bevacizumab administration recommend . Treatment Phase ( pre- post-operative ) Standard Clinical Assessments - Physical examination ( include basic neurologic exam investigator ) - ECOG performance status ( see Appendix 4 ) - Vital sign [ weight , body temperature , blood pressure , pulse/ heart rate ] - On ( schedule ) visit , patient assess adverse event ( grade common terminology criterion adverse event ( CTCAE version 3.0 ) . Laboratory Assessments The following laboratory test do : - White blood cell count differential ( lymphocyte , neutrophil ) , red blood cell count , hemoglobin , hematocrit platelet count - Bilirubin ( total direct ) , ASAT , ALAT , alkaline phosphatase , albumin , LDH - Serum creatinine - Glucose - Electrolytes ( sodium , potassium ) - Calcium - INR ( patient receive oral anticoagulant treatment ) - CEA , CA 19-9 - Urinalysis : dip stick test protein perform administration bevacizumab . - Serum pregnancy test ( clinically indicate ) Surgery Control Visits Surgery The first control visit perform 10 day surgery include follow assessment : - ECOG performance status - Vital sign [ weight , body temperature , blood pressure , pulse/ heart rate ] - Haematology , Blood chemistry Coagulation - Adverse event ( grade common terminology criterion adverse event ( CTCAE version 3.0 ) special regard wound heal The second control visit perform 21 day surgery include assessment first control visit addition : - Physical examination - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) - Tumour Assessment Final Visit End treatment safety visit perform 28 day last drug administration . Follow Phase Termination Study Progression Free Survival Status Survival status assess every 3 month maximum 2 year . STUDY MEDICATION Dose , Schedule Administration Bevacizumab Bevacizumab give 5 mg/kg d1 every two week , 5 consecutive cycle . The 6th cycle XELOX without Bevacizumab , allow time window last administration Bevacizumab surgery 5 week . The time window surgery re-start treatment least 4 week wound heal must complete . Bevacizumab give 5 mg/kg d1 every two week , 6 consecutive cycle combination XELOX . Bevacizumab dose calculate patient milligram per kilogram . The patient 's actual weight screen visit reference weight throughout study ( i.e. , patient receive dose treatment ) . Doses Bevacizumab recalculate patient experience 10 % change body weight baseline treatment period . All patient receive infusion study drug total volume 100 mL 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP . Bevacizumab infusion administer mixed dextrose glucose solution . The initial study drug dose deliver 90 minute continuous IV infusion . If first infusion tolerate without infusion associate adverse event second infusion may deliver 60 minute . If 60 minute infusion tolerate , subsequent infusion may deliver 30 minute . If patient experience infusion associate adverse event 60 minute infusion , subsequent dos give 90 minute . If patient experience infusion associate adverse event 30 minute infusion , subsequent dos give 60 minute . Should extravasation study drug infusion occur , follow step take : 1 . Discontinue IV . 2 . If significant volume study drug infusion remain , restart IV proximal site limb 3 . Treat infiltration accord institutional guideline infiltration noncaustic agent . In pre-surgery phase , Bevacizumab obtain locally prescription . After surgery , Bevacizumab supply glass vial 4-mL fill , contain 100 mg ( 25 mg/mL ) 16-mL fill , contain 400 mg ( 25 mg/mL ) . Vials contain preservative single use . Oxaliplatin Liquid Oxaliplatin give 85 mg/m2 d1 every two week , 6 consecutive cycle , surgery . Liquid Oxaliplatin dose calculate use body surface area ( BSA ) patient ( see Appendix 2 ) . The dose oxaliplatin administer close possible calculate dose . Liquid Oxaliplatin administration require hyperhydration . In event extravasation , administration must discontinue immediately . For nausea vomiting , 5-HT3 antagonist without dexamethasone strongly recommend oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy . Liquid Oxaliplatin must infuse either peripheral vein central venous line 2 hour . The infusion line must adequately flush 5 % dextrose solution ( D5W ) oxaliplatin infusion administration drug . Liquid Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin® ) obtain locally prescription . Capecitabine The dose Capecitabine 1.500 mg/m2 twice daily even d1 morning d8 , follow 1 week rest period . One treatment cycle consist 2 week . Capecitabine give 6 consecutive cycle , surgery . The appropriate daily dose capecitabine identify determination Body Surface Area ( see Appendix 2 3 ) . Capecitabine administer orally within 30 minute end meal ( breakfast , dinner ) . Tablets swallow approximately 200 mL water ( fruit juice ) . The first dose cycle administer even dose day 1 last dose cycle schedule morning day 8 , follow 7 day rest period . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) obtain locally prescription . Study Treatment Duration In pre-operative treatment phase 6 cycle XELOX 5 cycle Bevacizumab administer , result total treatment duration 12 week . Surgery perform 2 week last administration Capecitabine . Post-operative treatment consist 6 cycle XELOX + Bevacizumab re-start 4-5 week surgery .</detailed_description>
