	<brief_summary>Central hypothesis : Gastric bypass surgery reduces risk CVD morbidly obese subject ( define BMI ≥35 kg/m2 ) T2DM . To determine whether surgically induced weight loss decrease risk CVD morbidly obese subject T2DM . I hypothesize patient T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery significantly reduce mean level risk factor CVD compare diabetic individual BMI maintain weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Gastric Bypass Surgery Risk CVD Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) likely die cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) people without diabetes . Furthermore , patient diabetes benefit advance management CVD and/or risk factor result decrease mortality CVD patient without diabetes . Short-term study demonstrate weight loss overweight obese subject T2DM associate decreased insulin resistance , substantial improvement glycemic lipoprotein profile , reduction blood pressure . However , long-term data substantiate improvement maintain limited . Obesity , susceptibility weight gain , chronic condition . Continuous care require avoid weight regain especially intensive weight loss . Morbidly obese patient body mass index ( BMI ) 35 kg/m2 significant difficulty maintain weight loss adequate resolve obesity-related medical condition change lifestyle pharmacologic strategy . Currently , surgical treatment morbid obesity , term bariatric surgery , appear modality result significant sustained weight loss along reversal diabetes improvement cholesterol biosynthesis , lipoprotein metabolism morbidly obese patient . Given observation , question patient T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery significantly reduce level abnormality vascular structure function central development atherosclerosis . In Specific Aim 1 , determine whether surgically induced weight loss decrease risk CVD morbidly obese subject T2DM . In Specific Aim 2 , elucidate mechanism surgically induce weight loss reduces time risk CVD morbidly obese subject T2DM . The propose study prospective cohort clinical trial aim evaluate change time cardiovascular structure function morbidly obese subject T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery compare match control group undergo gastric bypass surgery . The result propose study provide foundation new clinical strategy aim prevent development CVD obese patient T2DM . Furthermore , serve baseline future large scale longitudinal study base aggregate occurrence severe cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
