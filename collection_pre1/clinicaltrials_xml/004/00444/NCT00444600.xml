	<brief_summary>The purpose study find well treatment diabetic macular edema ( DME ) : laser alone , laser combine intravitreal injection triamcinolone , laser combine intravitreal injection ranibizumab , intravitreal injection ranibizumab alone . At present time , know whether intravitreal steroid anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) injection , without laser treatment , good laser . It possible one type injection , without laser treatment , improve vision often laser without injection . However , even good vision outcome see injection , side effect may problem injection laser . Therefore , study conduct find whether benefit injection outweigh risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thus far demonstrated mean reduce risk vision loss diabetic macular edema laser photocoagulation , intensive glycemic control , blood pressure control . Earlier study show photocoagulation , although effective reduce risk moderate vision loss , eventually result retinal retinal pigment epithelium atrophy result loss central vision , central scotoma , decrease color vision . Consequently , many retinal specialist today tend treat diabetic macular edema ( DME ) lighter , less intense laser burn originally specify Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) . The additional unsatisfactory outcome treatment laser photocoagulation significant proportion eye DME prompt interest treatment modality . One treatment par plana vitrectomy . Studies suggest vitreomacular traction may play role increase retinal vascular permeability , removal vitreous , relief mechanical traction vitrectomy membrane stripping may substantially improve macular edema visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eyes component vitreomacular traction secondary edema . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor intravitreal corticosteroid investigation . The use antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) another treatment modality need explore potential benefit . Increased VEGF level demonstrate retina vitreous human eye diabetic retinopathy . VEGF , also know vascular permeability factor , show increase retinal vascular permeability vivo model . Therapy inhibit VEGF , therefore , may represent useful therapeutic modality target underlie pathogenesis diabetic macular edema . Ranibizumab promising anti-VEGF drug . Its efficacy safety demonstrate treatment age-related macular degeneration . Reports use anti-VEGF drug DME suggest sufficient benefit warrant evaluation efficacy safety phase III trial . Corticosteroids , class substance anti-inflammatory property , also demonstrate inhibit expression VEGF gene . The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) currently conduct phase III randomize clinical trial compare focal photocoagulation intravitreal corticosteroid ( triamcinolone acetonide ) diabetic macular edema . However , even triamcinolone ranibizumab proven efficacious , major concern , base clinical observation intravitreal corticosteroid , DME recur effect intravitreal drug wear , necessitate repetitive injection long-term . Combining intravitreal drug ( triamcinolone ranibizumab ) photocoagulation provide hope one could get short-term benefit intravitreal drug ( decrease retinal thicken decrease fluid leakage ) long-term reduction fluid leakage result photocoagulation . In addition , possible worsen macular edema immediately follow focal photocoagulation , know complication treatment , could decrease intravitreal drug present time photocoagulation . This might result increase likelihood vision improvement follow photocoagulation decrease likelihood vision loss . This study design determine ranibizumab alone ranibizumab add laser photocoagulation efficacious photocoagulation alone , , determine combine ranibizumab photocoagulation reduces total number injection need obtain benefit . Furthermore , study design determine combine photocoagulation corticosteroid , class drug currently consider treatment DME , efficacious population enrol . Subjects randomly assign one follow 4 group : 1 . Group A : Sham injection plus focal ( macular ) photocoagulation 2 . Group B : 0.5 mg injection intravitreal ranibizumab plus focal photocoagulation 3 . Group C : 0.5 mg injection intravitreal ranibizumab plus deferred focal photocoagulation 4 . Group D : 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone plus focal photocoagulation In group A , B D , laser give 7-10 day initial injection time injection follow-up safety visit . During first year , subject evaluate retreatment every 4 week . The injection group A sham group B C ranibizumab . For group D , triamcinolone injection give one give prior 15 week ; otherwise sham injection give . For Groups A , B , D , focal photocoagulation give 7 10 day later follow injection unless focal photocoagulation give past 15 week macular edema present . In Years 2 3 , subject continue evaluate retreatment every 4 week unless injection discontinue due failure . In case , follow-up visit occur every 4 month treatment investigator discretion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria To eligible , follow inclusion criterion ( 15 ) must meet : Age &gt; = 18 year Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) At least one eye meet study eye criterion Fellow eye ( study eye ) meet criteria Able willing provide inform consent General Exclusion Criteria A subject eligible follow exclusion criterion present : Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . Major surgery within 28 day prior randomization major surgery plan next 6 month . Myocardial infarction , cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antivascular growth factor ( antiVEGF ) proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month . Subject expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center first 12 month study . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria The subject must one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . A subject may two study eye eligible time randomization . Best correct electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy ( EETDRS ) visual acuity letter score &lt; = 78 ( i.e. , 20/32 bad ) &gt; = 24 ( i.e. , 20/320 better ) within 8 day randomization . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema involve center macula . Ocular coherence tomography ( OCT ) central subfield &gt; =250 micron within 8 day randomization . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , subject cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . If prior macular photocoagulation perform , investigator believe study eye may possibly benefit additional photocoagulation . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria The following exclusion apply study eye ( i.e. , may present nonstudy eye ) : Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc . ) Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) .
