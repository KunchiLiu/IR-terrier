In Phase 1 , 1500 individual female twin identify Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry ( MATR ) base self report history irregular period and/or cystic ovary MATR General Health Screening Questionnaire . Those twin survey phone trait associate PCOS . In Phase 2 , twin likely PCOS base answer Phase 1 phone survey recontacted PCOS screen . One twin pair screen elevated level testosterone ( total free testosterone , bioavailable testosterone BaT ; free androgen index FAI ) . Hyperandrogenism one hallmark traits PCOS exhibit either biochemically ( elevated testosterone ) clinically ( hirsutism , acne , hair loss , alopecia , ) . If one twin pair elevate BaT level , twin pair ask undergo medical evaluation PCOS confirmation . This include physical exam , medical history , ultrasound , 2-hour glucose tolerance biochemical blood test , Ferriman-Gallwey evaluation abnormal hirsutism ( another characteristic PCOS ) . The woman also test pregnancy zygosity . Their female co-twins invite undergo similar medical evaluation . Depending PCOS trait , twin pair neither member elevate testosterone level might ask undergo medical evaluation well . In clinical practice , PCOS diagnose often make woman normal testosterone level certain PCOS trait . The determination include pairs member normal testosterone level make depend collective PCOS trait report Phase 1 survey .</detailed_description>
