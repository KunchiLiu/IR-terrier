	<detailed_description>This single site Phase I dose escalation trial epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor Erlotinib SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib patient previously treat advanced stage ( Stage IIIB/IV disease ) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The screening evaluation consist medical history include dates/description initial NSCLC diagnosis documentation previous treatment . There also physical examination include vital sign , height , weight , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status , blood draw Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) Complete Metabolic Panel ( CMP ) test , neurological examination , pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential , ( applicable ) observable tumor measurement within 14 day study enrollment . A screening Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) well clinical test evaluate know site malignant lesion , include Computed Tomography ( CTs ) chest upper abdomen , adrenal gland ; ultrasound ; radionuclide scan bone ; and/or radiographic study perform within 30 day prior enrollment . The treatment regimen consist Erlotinib tablet start Day 1 Dasatinib tablet start Day 9 28-day cycle . If DLTs , dose escalation continue . Patients continue therapy past two cycle see treat physician every 4 week complete History Physical ( H &amp; P ) , CBC , CMP . Tumor measurement response assessment occur every 6-8 week . Dasatinib Erlotinib continue progression disease , unacceptable toxicity , patient request . The recommended phase II dose combine treatment define patient treat recommended phase II dose confirm tolerability .</detailed_description>
