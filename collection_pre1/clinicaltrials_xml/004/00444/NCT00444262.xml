	<brief_title>Stroke Volume Optimisation Patients With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Hip fracture patient frequently develop postoperative complication increase hospital length stay cost care . These complication also associate increased mortality . Perioperative tissue hypoperfusion may participate development postoperative complication . Hypovolemia secondary many factor hip fracture patient ( include blood loss , fast dehydration ) result low cardiac output tissue hypoperfusion . Two single-center , randomize , double-blind study demonstrate peroperative fluid titration guide esophageal Doppler measurement stroke volume could improve patient outcome . Interpretation result stroke volume `` optimisation '' strategy could help anesthesiologist give fluid patient reduce risk hypoperfusion without risk congestion , thereby reduce postoperative complication improve patient outcome . We want test hypothesis multicenter trial confirm high level proof usefulness strategy . If previous result confirm , could lead change current anesthetic management hip fracture patient potentially important economical impact health costs.Goals : Primary endpoint demonstrate colloid ( Voluven® ) titration , guide use esophageal Doppler estimation stroke volume , surgical repair hip fracture reduce incidence postoperative complication ( composite criterion ) . Secondary endpoint `` optimise group '' include : 1 ) reduce delay walk without help ; 2 ) increase number day `` out-of-hospital `` 3 month fracture ; 3 ) reduce 1-year mortality .</detailed_description>
