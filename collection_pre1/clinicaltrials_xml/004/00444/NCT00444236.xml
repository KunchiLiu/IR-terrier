	<brief_summary>We propose acid reflux affect respiratory dynamic ( breathe ) patient exercise athlete improve exercise capacity acid suppression therapy . It intent determine whether treatment GER strong acid suppression may alleviate symptom , improve exercise capacity , improve quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Acid Reflux Respiratory Physiology During Exercise Athletes With GER-Response Acid Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , blind , cross-over trial . We plan take athlete classical GER , cough , shortness breath , chest tightness exercise subject complete pulmonary function test conjunction exercise pH test . We assess whether athlete experience increase reflux duration episode exercise . The athlete randomize ( cross fashion ) acid suppression ( BID Nexium 40 mg ) placebo 10-12 week . Both athlete investigator blind . After 10-12 week , exercise testing ( ramp protocol VO2 anaerobic threshold ) concurrent respiratory function test repeat along symptom assessment . After brief washout period 1-2 week , athletes cross-over study medication 10-12 week . Again , end study period , symptomatic relief well respiratory function improvement assess repeat initial exercise regimen . The exercise regimens medication regimen hold stable indirectly , result `` feeling good worse '' medication/placebo , patient may increase/ decrease exercise routine , result change overall endurance , anaerobic threshold , etc ( endpoint ) . By keep regimen stable , allow change occur large enough detect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We plan take athlete ( cyclist ) GER ( heartburn symptom dailyweekly basis either improved trial acid suppression objectively document via pH/endoscopic testing may include exercise ) experience one following symptom exercise , limit perceive ability exercise full capacity : choking cough wheeze shortness breath chest tightness exercise Athletes define person exercise routine basis ( least 3 time week average ) least past 6 month . Subjects must least 18 year old . Pregnancy Age less 18 year great 65 year Abnormal methacholine challenge test exclude one enrollment ( document prior study ) often patient GER heighten bronchial reactivity .</criteria>
