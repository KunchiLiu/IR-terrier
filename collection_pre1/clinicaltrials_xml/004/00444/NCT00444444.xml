	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Predicting Relapse During Steroid Treatment Autoimmune Pancreatitis ( AIP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune chronic pancreatitis ( AIP ) define chronic inflammation pancreas due autoimmune mechanism ; autoimmunity responsible produce pancreatic lesion . AIP distinctive type chronic pancreatitis show reversible improvement pancreatic morphology function oral steroid therapy , comparison type chronic pancreatitis hardly respond various treatment . AIP increasingly recognize worldwide entity . The sudden increment case report probably reflect grow awareness entity , rather rise true incidence . In previous Japanese report , HLA DRB1*0405-DQB*0401 haplotype may associate autoimmune pancreatitis Japanese population . However , date subsequent data support result . In addition , Japanese study limitation methodology use low-resolution typing HLA . Although entity well responsive steroid therapy , relapse AIP steroid treatment uncommon . Unfortunately , laboratory genetic predictor responsiveness steroid therapy patient AIP . To clarify confirm high-risk protective genotype autoimmune disease , therefore , high-resolution type HLA need . Thus , determine whether certain allele haplotype major histocompatibility complex gene associate AIP Korean population , undertook study high-resolution type HLA ( sequence-based typing ) .</detailed_description>
