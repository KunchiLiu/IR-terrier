	<detailed_description>The main research question protocol aim answer whether treatment growth hormone impact body composition , quality life , energy balance PWS adult , loss effect cessation treatment least 12 month . Specific outcomes evaluated follow : • Increased IGF-1 function human growth hormone dosage compare baseline . 1 . Improvement indicator risk factor co-morbid disease [ diabetes ( measure insulin glucose level ) , cardiovascular disease ( measure lipid fatty acid ) , pulmonary function ] participant . 2 . Improvement quality life measure indicate rating establish behavior checklist participant . 3 . Changes body composition ( decreased fat , increase lean body mass bone density ) determine DEXA participant . 4 . Increased energy expenditure determine whole-room calorimeter measure ( 8 hour energy expenditure , RMR , TEF , mechanical work ) ; diet record , physical activity monitor strength measure .</detailed_description>
