	<brief_summary>Heart failure , chronic illness afflict 5 million person United States know cause shortness breath fatigue , yet least half person heart failure also report presence pain . The cause pain person clear . PAIN-HF ( Pain Assessment , Incidence &amp; Nature Heart Failure ) , conduct Palliative Care-Heart Failure Education And Research Trials ( PC-HEART ) collaborative identify prevalence pain , location , severity impact activity possible cause pain person live heart failure . The study also try understand relationship problem pain , well treatment give reduce pain . Understanding source pain characteristic first step help health care provider well manage pain related problem person heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Assessment , Incidence &amp; Nature Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit via physician nurse provide care clinical site member PC-HEART . PC-HEART volunteer collaborative clinician-investigators 60 site nationally include hospice organization heart failure provider academic , Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) community setting . Our goal enroll 400 patient 135 hospice care 265 outpatient setting ( mix HMO , community practice , VA , academic center ) member Palliative Care- Heart Failure Education And Research Trials ( PC-HEART ) collaborative . We strive broad representation patient live community one-third African American patient ( often present initial treatment advance heart failure ) least one-half elderly ( high prevalence pain heart failure ) . We use standardized tool survey patient , follow : Pain &amp; symptom ( Assessed enrollment one-two week later ) : Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale- HF ( MSAS-HF ) Short-form McGill pain questionnaire ( SF-MPQ ) Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) Heart-failure specific measure ( Assessed Enrollment ) : Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) Psycho-social situation &amp; cognitive function ( Assessed Enrollment ) : Physicians Health Questionnaire depression screen ( PHQ-9 ) Mini-cog Social functioning : ENRICHD Social Support Inventory ( ESSI ) , The Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) collect 1/2 subject Clinical Data ( medical record ) Patient 's medical condition : Charleson Comorbidity Scale , prior diagnosis Diabetes Mellitus , Cancer , Chronic lung disease , Coronary Artery Disease , Cirrhosis . Known painful condition ( osteoarthritis , chronic back pain , CAD angina , neuropathy , others ) Physical examination : Jugular Venous Pressure ( per NIH trial standard : base neck , ½ way , jaw level ) , edema ( +1 ( 0-1/4 '' depression ) , +2 ( 1/4-1/2 '' ) , +3 ( 1/2-1 '' ) , +4 ( &gt; 1 '' ) ) , Blood pressure , Respiratory rate , Heart rate &amp; rhythm Echocardiogram data : Date recent Echocardiogram , LVEF , LVDD , LA dimension , presence valvular disease &amp; measure severity ( example , aortic stenosis valve area , mitral regurgitation 1+-4+ ) Laboratory data : BUN , CR , Na+ , HgB , BNP , hemoglobin Demographic Data Age , Sex , Race &amp; ethnic identification , Marital Status , Living situation ( alone , family , person ) , employment status ( employ , self-employed , retired , unemployed due disability ) , high level education , religious affiliation , annual household income , insurance ( none , Medicare , Medicaid , Veterans Administration , Kaiser , Health Maintenance Organization , private fee service ) . Medications &amp; Treatment ( Assessed Enrollment 1-2 week later ) Heart Failure medication : ACEI , ARB , β-blocker , digoxin , spironolactone , eplerenone , loop diuretic , nesiritide , inotropes , warfarin Analgesics : NSAIDs , Cox-2 inhibitor , Aspirin , Acetaminophen , Tramadol , Opioids Antidepressants : SSRI , Tricyclics , Psychostimulants , Topical agent : acetylsalicylate acid cream , capsaicin Physical therapy , cold , heat , modality Statistical Evaluation We report frequency pain total , frequency level severity &amp; interference activity pain , occasional versus frequent constant pain , location descriptive statistic . To extent etiology pain identify report descriptive statistic . Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient , t-test frequency statistic ( Chi-square Fisher 's Exact test ) use evaluate association pain presence , severity type demographic clinical variable . If possible , comparison make patient without pain pain use chi-square test t-test . A multivariate analysis variance use ass relationship pain measure heart failure severity , social support , depression symptom distress pain . Differences Pain measure assess enrollment second assessment 1-2 week later , change correlate change treatment pain . Geographic location pain map use body diagram BPI identify area great frequency .</detailed_description>
