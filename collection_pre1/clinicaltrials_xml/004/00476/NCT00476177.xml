	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety add donor dendritic cell donor lymphocyte infusion , determine type severity side effect associate addition . Previously patient hematologic malignancy relapse transplant give infusion donor white blood cell ( donor lymphocyte infusion , DLI ) way boost immune function fight disease . Although DLI lead cancer regression patient , overall response rate use DLI alone low , unfortunately , rarely last . Researchers discover new subset blood cell , call dendritic cell ( DC ) , crucial partner lymphocytes generate immune response . We believe infusion DC together DLI may improve ability donor lymphocytes recognize kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Dendritic Cells And Donor Lymphocytes Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies After Allogeneic Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose donor dendritic cell administer safely DLI patient allogeneic stem cell transplant , everyone participates study receive number dendritic cell . - The study procedure divide 3 phase : 1 ) Pre-infusion evaluation , 2 ) Cell collection infusion , 3 ) Follow-up infusion . - Pre-infusion evaluation : Routine blood test perform participant donor . The participant undergo bone marrow aspirate biopsy recently perform . During time , additional standard blood test and/or radiology test may do fully determine extent cancer . - Cell Collections : About 2-3 week infusion date , donor undergo one two white blood cell collection procedure call leukopheresis . The cell collect first leukopheresis send laboratory portion use cultivate dendritic cell , remain lymphocyte set aside DLI . If number cell collect first leukopheresis insufficient , donor undergo second leukopheresis procedure 7-10 day later . - Infusions : We plan administer dendritic cell donor lymphocyte separately outpatient clinic . The dendritic cell give first , follow DLI one two day later . - Follow-up infusion : After completion donor DC DLI , participant follow closely development side effect response . They evaluate least week , routine blood test physical examination ass graft vs. host disease ( GvHD ) side effect perform . Additional blood test do 3 , 6 , 10 week . At 10 week lymphocyte infusion , bone marrow aspirate biopsy perform assess disease well percentage bone marrow cell derive donor . Additional restaging study also perform 10 week .</detailed_description>
