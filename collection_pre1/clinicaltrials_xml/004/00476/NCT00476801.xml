	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation evaluate effectiveness investigational device similar appearance `` tanning bed '' emits ultraviolet irradiation specific wavelength know UVA1 . This device approve FDA general use country , yet , use quite successfully Europe several year treat condition scleroderma , keloid , fibrosing condition skin . Your participation study may yield important information regard safety effectiveness form light therapy treatment skin condition , present , difficult treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UVA1 Light Treatment Scleroderma Similar Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultraviolet ray sun reach earth surface divide short wavelength , hence high energy , UVB ( 290-320nm ) long wavelength , hence low energy UVA ( 320-400nm ) . The wavelengths light cause sunburn associate skin cancer causation high energy UVB . UVA wavelength divide relatively short wavelength , hence high energy UVA2 ( 320-340nm ) long wavelength , low energy UVA1 ( 340-400nm ) . Phototherapy light box use clinic treatment psoriasis , atopic dermatitis , pruritus , well use tan salon emit UVB UVA wavelength light . The advantage use UVA1 light source treatment skin condition 1 ) lack skin cancer sunburn cause ray ( UVB/UVA2 ) 2 ) consequence , ability treat patient safely . Keloid , scleroderma , acne keloidalis nucha , burn scar characterize collagenous thicken skin result superficial deep cutaneous sclerosis . Treatments disable condition inadequate present . Recently , non-controlled study , UVA1 show induce improvement patient scleroderma , granuloma annulare urticaria pigmentosa ( 1-3 ) . The mode action UVA1 treatment completely understood , however , local immuno-modulation appear important ( 4 ) . UVA1 also show stimulate collagenase activity dose dependent manner dermis ( 5,6 ) . We postulate , therefore , UVA1 appropriate dos improve fibrosing skin condition safely collagenase-mediated removal excess dermal collagen .</detailed_description>
