	<detailed_description>Introduction : Stress fracture ( SFx ) one common debilitate overuse injury see military recruit , also problematic non-military athletic population . The goal randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled study determine calcium vitamin D intervention could reduce incidence SFx female recruit basic training . Methods : We recruit 5201 female Navy recruit volunteer randomize 2000 mg calcium 800 IU vitamin D supplement/day placebo . SFx ascertain recruit report Great Lakes clinic symptom . All SFx confirm radiography technetium scan accord usual Navy protocol . Results : A total 309 subject diagnose SFx result incidence 5.9 % per eight week . Using `` intention-to-treat '' analysis include enrolled subject , Fisher 's Exact test find calcium vitamin D group 25 % low incidence SFx control group ( 6.6 % vs 5.3 % , respectively , p=0.03 ) . The per protocol analysis , include 3700 recruit complete study , find 27 % low incidence fracture supplement vs control group ( 8.6 % vs 6.8 % , respectively , p=0.02 ) . Conclusions : Generalizing finding population 14,416 female enter basic training Great Lakes 24 month recruitment , calcium vitamin D supplementation entire cohort would prevent 130 person per year fracturing . Such decrease SFx would associate significant decrease morbidity financial cost .</detailed_description>
