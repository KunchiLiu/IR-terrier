	<brief_summary>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) chronic disorder liver cause jaundice liver damage . When Cystic Fibrosis affect liver , damage liver look like liver PSC . This study design answer question whether isolated PSC may form CF liver</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) progressive autosomal recessive disorder cause defect cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene ( CFTR ) . CFTR mutation cause loss impairment CFTR-mediated ion transport across epithelial cell membrane . CF affect many organ include respiratory tract , pancreas , intestine , liver male reproductive tract . Liver disease occur less frequently pulmonary disease . CFTR express bile duct epithelial cell responsible hydration biliary secretion . CF recently , think multi-organ disease . However , recognize non-classical presentation CF involve organ well establish data single -organ involvement include Congenital Absence Vas Deferens recurrent pancreatitis . CF PSC several feature common . They affect intrahepatic bile duct inspisated biliary secretion , chronic inflammation fibrosis . Is PSC `` single-organ presentation '' CF ? Patients PSC undergo test CF protein channel nasal potential testing . This test perform insering thin plastic tube 2 3 cm nostril chloride transport measure . This test may show patient abnormality CF protein channel .</detailed_description>
