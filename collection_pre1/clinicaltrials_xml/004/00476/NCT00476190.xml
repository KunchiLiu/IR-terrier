	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness multi-drug chemotherapy regimen adult patient Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) . We use regimen often use pediatric patient add drug call PEG-asparaginase E. coli asparaginase . PEG-asparaginase give injection past use treatment child adult ALL . Information research study suggest intravenous PEG-asparaginase administer safely child adult . We hope gain information participant disease responds standard chemotherapy drug use treat ALL &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- This study several period treatment call phase use several different drug phase . The drug may give mouth , vein , spinal fluid ( call intrathecal chemotherapy ) . In individual treatment help prevent leukemia cell come back spinal fluid brain . Radiation therapy also administer part treatment regimen . - The treatment program consist 2-different treatment arm six separate phase therapy . The phase treatment : ( 1 ) Steroid prophase ( 2 ) Induction ( 3 ) Consolidation I ( 4 ) Central nervous system ( CNS ) therapy ( 5 ) Consolidation II ( 6 ) Continuation . - The participant treatment arm depend status leukemia end induction therapy ( second phase treatment ) . Arm A : participant achieve complete remission Induction Arm B : participant fail achieve complete remission Induction . - Steroid Prophase : All participant involve treatment phase consist two drug , one give intravenously ( IV ) one give intrathecally . This phase last 3 day purpose collect scientific data might useful future see steroid work treat leukemia - Induction : This phase begin immediately steroid prophase last 1 month . Induction use cause remission . Eight drug use phase treatment , administration either orally , IV intrathecal . On day 29 , participant 's bone marrow peripheral blood count test . If achieve complete remission partial remission , proceed next phase treatment . If complete remission , receive vincristine IV day 32 , 39 46 , complete remission achieve . If achieve complete partial remission day 53 remove study . - Consolidation I : This phase treatment begin soon documented confirmation participant 's leukemia either complete partial remission . Treatment phase last 7 week intend reduce number leukemia cell body . This consolidation treatment consist 3 phase : 1A , 1B 1C . Each phase involve three week cycle chemotherapy . Arm A Arm B assign accord remission status induction therapy determine order participant follow Consolidation phase . - Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Therapy : CNS therapy begin 3 week end Consolidation I therapy last 3 week . Treatment include series lumbar puncture administration anti-leukemia drug well oral drug IV drug . Radiation therapy also give phase therapy . The purpose radiation therapy prevent leukemia come back brain . Radiation therapy give either 8 10 daily treatment . - Consolidation II Therapy : This phase begin soon CNS therapy end last 27-30 week . It consist cycle chemotherapy repeat every three week along IV PEG-asparaginase administer every 3 week . The cycle repeat participant receives total 10 dos asparaginase . - Continuation Therapy : This phase begin end Consolidation II phase . The goal phase get rid leukemia body . It consist cycle chemotherapy repeat every three week last participant remission two year . - During phase treatment , participant test procedure monitor health research purpose .</detailed_description>
