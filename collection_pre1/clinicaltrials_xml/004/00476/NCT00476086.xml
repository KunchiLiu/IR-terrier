	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Gemcitabine Followed Radiation Therapy Management Mixed Mullerian Tumors Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary To determine feasibility dual modality therapy describe cytotoxic therapy follow radiation therapy management Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumors ( MMMTs ) . Secondary * To describe response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate feasibility oxaliplatin gemcitabine prior radiation therapy define complete 3 cycle chemotherapy . The null alternative therapy completion rate 25 % 50 % . If 3 participant enrol stage one cohort ( n=9 participant ) complete therapy accrual would proceed stage two ( n=15 participant ) . If therapy complete least 10 participant final set 24 evaluable participant regimen would deem worthy study . This design 80 % power give one-sided type I error 5 % probability stop early 0.60 .</detailed_description>
