	<brief_summary>This study examine bacteria patient mouths different time stem cell transplantation recovery . Drugs patient receive part conditioning process stem cell transplant increase risk infection . There might link bacteria mouth bacteria cause infection . Knowing change bacteria might help researcher determine best method prevent infection . Patients 18 year age old schedule receive stem cell transplant may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Review medical record Interview oral care Oral examination Collection oral specimen stem cell transplant , immediately transplant , 3 week transplant . The specimen obtain follow : - &lt; TAB &gt; -About one-fourth teaspoon saliva collect suction device similar use dental office . - &lt; TAB &gt; -Plaque surface tooth collect plastic toothpick . - &lt; TAB &gt; -Skin cell inside cheek surface tongue collect small soft brush . - &lt; TAB &gt; -If tube insert patient lung assist breathe patient admit intensive care unit , specimen lung collect . Patients follow 100 day transplant . Additional oral specimen obtain develop sign symptom respiratory infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mouth complex biological ecosystem normally contain 700 different specie bacteria . These bacteria live exopolysacchride matrix biofilm . Usually , bacteria colonize oral cavity benignly . However , several study critically ill patient demonstrate change oral flora acute illness . Identification respiratory pathogen mouth lead researcher hypothesize relationship exist oral cavity pulmonary infection . A common complication allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) infection pneumonia . Identification potential pathogen oral cavity allogeneic stem cell patient could indicate similar association oral pathogen infection . A study describe oral microbial community patient possibility organisms source infection . The primary objective study describe change oral microbial flora allogeneic SCT patient three time point treatment recovery . Observed difference microbial organism baseline ( prior transplantation ) , neutropenia ( within 48 hour nadir post-transplantation ) myeloid engraftment ( 14-21 day post transplantation ) described . In course treatment , patient develop respiratory sign symptom require either re-admission inpatient unit intensive care unit admission , additional oral specimen collect . The secondary objective ass oral microbial flora find development respiratory sign symptom allogeneic PBSCT patient first 100 day post-transplant . In addition , patient require intubation , tracheal aspirate oral specimen collect . The population compose adult patient plan undergo allogeneic PBSCT provide inform consent . The design prospective , descriptive study microbial flora oral cavity adult allogeneic stem cell transplant patient . Saliva specimens , dental plaque mucosal brushing collect three different time . Oral specimen obtain patient develop respiratory sign symptom require additional inpatient intensive care unit admission . Patients follow assessed respiratory sign , symptom , inpatient ICU admission day 100 post-transplant . The presence bacteria ( type specie ) determine molecular genetics . The identification bacteria study use various comparative molecular technique , include DNA array Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All adult patient admit Clinical Research Center NIH 18 year age old schedule undergo allogeneic PBSCT eligible enrollment . Collection oral specimen child allogeneic transplant recipient would increase anxiety participant may require sedation . For reason child exclude protocol . All adult patient provide informed consent schedule receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant eligible enrollment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients recent oral surgery oral trauma exclude . Patients tracheostomy also exclude . Patients sickle cell disease chronic granulomatous disease transplant exclude protocol . Patients le 18 year age exclude .</criteria>
