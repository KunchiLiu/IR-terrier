	<brief_summary>In research study look see vulvar cancer respond erlotinib therapy . Two distinct patient population target : woman locally advance measurable squamous cell carcinoma vulva , primary recurrent , candidate definitive treatment surgery chemoradiation ( Cohort 1 ) woman radiographically measurable distant metastatic cancer either time presentation recurrence ( Cohort 2 ) . Another goal study learn protein gene present vulvar cancer may affect response erlotinib . Erlotinib treat cancer prevent cancer cell grow multiplying . It block certain protein surface type cancer cell . Laboratory test show vulvar cancer cell high level protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary â€¢ To determine clinical efficacy erlotinib reduce size vulvar squamous cell cancer /or metastatic lesion . Secondary - To determine safety tolerability oral erlotinib . - To evaluate apoptosis ass Ki67 , phospho-EGFR , EGFR mutation EGFR amplification status vulvar cancer prior therapy correlate observe change response therapy . - To evaluate impact medical treatment subsequent surgery vulvar cancer surgery choose definitive therapy . STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate efficacy erlotinib base response determine prior definitive surgery chemoradiation ( cohort 1 ) every 2 cycle erlotinib ( cohort 2 ) . The null alternative response rate define achieve partial response ( PR ) well 3.5 % 15 % . If 1 patient enrol stage one ( n=17 patient ) achieve PR well accrual would proceed stage two ( n=24 patient ) . There 0.55 probability stop trial stage one true OR rate 3.5 % . If 3 few response observe end stage two , erlotinib would deem ineffective . The significance level study design 0.0495 power 85 % rule poor response rate le 3.5 % .</detailed_description>
