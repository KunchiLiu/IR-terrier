	<brief_title>The Effect N-Acetylcystein Quality Life Air Trapping During Rest After Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) major cause chronic morbidity mortality throughout world . Many people suffer disease year die prematurely complication . COPD fourth lead cause death world , increase prevalence mortality predict come decade . COPD characterize slowly progress , irreversible airflow limitation cause chronic inflammation bronchiole . It diagnose perform spirometry . In early stage , COPD asymptomatic , although episode cough , often sputum production , rare . In advance stage , also symptoms shortness breath exertion , significant part lung function may reduce . The diagnosis COPD usually establish late stage , diagnostic delay may either due patient ’ gradual adaptation decrease lung function denial disease . In addition , doctor unaware , respond symptom patient . The main cause COPD smoking often manifest someone smoke 20 cigarette day 20 year ( 20 pack year ) . A smoker `` sensitive '' cigarette smoke may therefore spirometric change age 40 45 year start smoke teenager early 20th . It estimate 15–20 % smoker develop COPD , recent research suggest many 50 % develop COPD smoker reach high age . Treatment COPD patient depend stage disease . First strongly recommend quit smoking , bronchodilator drug add . In advanced stage inhale corticosteroid pulmonary rehabilitation add . In hypoxemic patient long term supplemental oxygen advise . The addition sputum modifier drug equivocal , since objective improvement document . N-Acetylcystein ( NAC ) drug know anti-oxidant mucolytic activity .
