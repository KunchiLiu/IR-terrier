	<detailed_description>We propose 2-arm , parallel group , randomize control trial test efficacy school ethnic dance program plus culturally-tailored , home-based screen time reduction intervention reduce weight gain ( body mass index ) among low socioeconomic status , pre-adolescent Latina girl . The control group receive `` active-placebo '' information-based health education intervention . A total 240 7-9 year old girl randomize two condition , intervention last full 2-year period study girl . Latina girl increase risk obesity obesity-related morbidity . However , effective generalizable obesity prevention program rapidly grow population available .

To test efficacy combine , school ethnic dance home-based screen time reduction intervention reduce weight gain ( BMI ) 2 year . Primary hypothesis : Compared control , girl treatment group significantly reduce weight gain ( BMI ) two-year study period . 2 .
