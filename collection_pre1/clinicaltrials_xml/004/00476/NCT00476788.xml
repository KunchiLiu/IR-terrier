	<brief_title>Fast Track CSII Using Novel Device Young Children With Newly Diagnosed T1DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) rise worldwide , especially child young six year age . Glycemic control use multiple daily injection ( MDI ) therapy difficult achieve maintain young , especially immediate post-diagnosis period . This study evaluate early initiation continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) therapy young child use novel delivery method form self-contained , lightweight , disposable insulin pump unit control wireless handheld device . The outcomes interest feasibility , safety , potential metabolic benefit approach . We recruit 14 pediatric patient , age one ten year , pool child newly diagnose T1DM admit Children 's Hospital Alabama use pump.General diabetes education CSII-specific training take place series outpatient session PI study nurse . Pump therapy initiate within two month diagnosis provide requisite education training successfully complete . Data collect study group control group patient six month via phone call monthly clinic visit . Areas evaluate include glycemic control , residual endogenous insulin secretion , frequency severe adverse event , parental distress , insulin need , physical growth . While initiate CSII immediate post-diagnosis period population may initially time-intensive , anticipated ultimately become time-saving great ease blood sugar management .</detailed_description>
