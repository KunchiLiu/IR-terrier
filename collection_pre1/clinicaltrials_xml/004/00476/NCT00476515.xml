	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - Conversion positive donor specific cross-match living donor negative cross-match thereby allow successful renal transplantation . - Transplant success failure follow desensitization protocol . - Determination effect rituximab kinetics donor specific antibody ( DSA ) . - Determination effect rituximab kinetics B-cell subpopulation peripheral blood and/or secondary lymphoid organ ( lymph node biopsy time transplant , available ) responder non-responders use flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry . Secondary Objectives : -Decrease incidence humoral rejection le 50 % 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Therapy Patients Kidney Transplant Waiting List With Positive Donor Specific Crossmatch Living Donor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient donor specific antibody , protocol plasmapheresis intravenous immunoglobulin use remove circulate antibody suppress antibody production . While therapy effective enable transplantation , report failure rate 50 % ( Personal communication , Johns Hopkins ' group ) ; expensive ( average cost protocol $ 55,000.00 include transplant surgery cost ; personal communication : Johns Hopkins ' group ) may fraught infectious complication particularly combine current immunosuppression protocol . To date , effective treatment protocol design desensitize end stage renal disease patient high Panel Reactive Antibodies ( PRA ) ( i.e. , &gt; 70 % ) . Patients elevate PRA level longer median organ wait time compare low PRA . Patients elevate PRA decrease allograft survival compare control . It report 50 % cadaveric kidney transplant high PRA recipient ( &gt; 20 % ) suffer rejection within 6 month transplantation . Pathophysiologically , elevate PRA donor specific antibody acquire sensitization host major histocompatibility antigen ( HLA ) follow multiple blood transfusion , prior pregnancy organ transplantation . The constant level anti-HLA antibody maintain persistent stimulation naïve memory B-cells antigen . The number patient high PRA and/or donor specific antibody expect increase patient fail kidney transplant enter wait list . Although initially introduce treatment neoplasm , humoral immunosuppressant effect Rituximab show clinical significance . In attempt understand humoral immunosuppressant effect Rituximab Gonzalez-Stawinski et al. , report effect monoclonal de-novo memory humoral immune response . Their work show Rituximab interferes primary secondary humoral response eliminate B-cells prior antigen exposure thus interfere differentiation antibody secrete cell specific antibody production ( Gonzalez-Stawinski ) Enthusiasm data result small , single center experience use Rituximab post-transplant pre-transplant setting . Post-transplantation , Becker et al . utilized Rituximab rescue therapy 4 kidney transplant patient develop acute humoral rejection . These patient fail conventional rescue therapy ( high dose intravenous steroid , plasmapheresis IVIg ) , transplant salvage single dose Rituximab ( 375mg/M2 ) demonstrate improvement creatinine clearance . Also post-transplant setting , Samaniego et al . successfully utilized Rituximab small population highly sensitize renal transplant patient positive donor specific crossmatch fail standard plasmapheresis IVIg protocol . Pre-transplantation , Vieira et al able reduce concentration anti-HLA antibody administration single dose Rituximab . Fifty percent patient PRA 's decrease nearly 40 % baseline . In small clinical report , Rituximab effective humoral immunosuppressant eliminate cell population responsible anti-HLA antibody production virtue modulation naïve memory B-cells prior to/or HLA stimulation . However , effect schema multiple dose Rituximab donor specific crossmatch yet determine .</detailed_description>
