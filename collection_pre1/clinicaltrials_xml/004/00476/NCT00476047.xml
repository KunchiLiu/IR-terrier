Monoclonal antibody , tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tositumomab Iodine I 131 Tositumomab Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma First Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival 2 year follow administration 131I-tositumomab ( tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab ) patient CLL/SLL achieve complete remission ( CR ) partial remission ( PR ) prior therapy . II . To improve response rate administer 131I-tositumomab patient achieve PR CR prior therapy . III . To eliminate residual disease ( document flow cytometry polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] ) use 131I-tositumomab patient achieve CR prior therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity 131I-tositumomab 1st remission patient previously treat CLL/SLL . OUTLINE : Patients receive tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 0 7-14 day later 30-60 minute . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
