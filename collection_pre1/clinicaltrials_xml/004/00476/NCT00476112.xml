	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Tolerance Efficacy Study RSD1235 Patients With Atrial Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 2 million report prevalent case atrial fibrillation atrial flutter ( AFL ) United States ( Heart Disease &amp; Stroke Statistics - 2003 Update , AHA ) . These arrhythmia may occasional sustain . AF/AFL usually associate age , general physical condition , rather specific cardiac event , often case ventricular arrhythmia . While directly fatal , arrhythmias cause discomfort lead stroke congestive heart failure . This Phase II/III trial Cardiome 's first study RSD1235 treatment atrial flutter . The study seek demonstrate RSD1235 's ability convert AFL sinus rhythm . The patient population atrial flutter duration great 3 hour less equal 45 day . This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized study patient AFL ; stratification base duration AFL . Treatment consider successful treatment-induced conversion atrial arrhythmia sinus rhythm minimum 1-minute Hour 1.5 ( Time 0 = start first infusion ) . All patient evaluate safety .</detailed_description>
