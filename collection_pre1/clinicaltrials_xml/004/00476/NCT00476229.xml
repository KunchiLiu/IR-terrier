	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To determine whether primary endpoint : composite success rate , define proportion patient alive day 100 ; without grade 3-4 Graft versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) ; without grade 4 toxicity ( unrelated infection ) ; engraft , likely least 40 % . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine cumulative incidence chronic graft versus host disease . 2 . To determine overall disease free survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The combination drug use study help weaken immune system , may help allow donor 's blood stem cell engraft ( grow ) body . Anti-thymocyte globulin ( also call ATG thymoglobulin ) design help reduce risk transplant rejection help prevent graft versus host disease . Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . If find eligible take part study , admit hospital 12 day blood stem cell transplant ( BSCT ) , order start pre-transplant treatment test . You blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test every day hospital ( transplant ) . After transplant , blood use check status transplant watch side effect . You receive radiation therapy ( total lymphoid irradiation ) total 10 day plan transplant . Radiation therapy give weekend . The last radiation treatment morning day receive stem cell transplant . For total 5 day admission hospital , also receive ATG . ATG give catheter ( plastic tube ) place large chest vein . The catheter ( call central venous catheter ) stay place throughout treatment . You receive certain drug premedication try prevent allergic reaction ATG . These may include drug like acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) , and/or steroid may include solumedrol prednisone . Tylenol give mouth , Benadryl steroids give either vein ( 10-15 minute ) mouth . The combination ATG radiation weaken immune system . A weaken immune system may help allow body `` accept '' donor cell , may decrease chance body reject cell . If diagnostic biopsy show certain protein find tumor cell , may also receive rituximab therapy . If eligible rituximab treatment , receive drug week 4 week . You receive rituximab central venous catheter vein 6-8 hour . The first dose give outpatient basis 13 day stem cell transplant . The next 3 dos may give hospital outpatient basis . You receive rituximab 6 day transplant , 1 8 day transplant . Tylenol steroids give rituximab try prevent allergic reaction . You give tacrolimus try prevent graft versus host disease ( donor 's immune cell react recipient 's body , attack recipient 's cell tissue ) . You receive tacrolimus either central venous catheter ( 24 hour time ) mouth start 3 day stem cell transplant . You continue receive tacrolimus long doctor feel necessary , could anywhere 3 month several year . This depend factor whether graft versus host disease , many donor cell blood , status disease . Cellcept ( MMF ) also give try prevent graft versus host disease , start 1 day transplant continue Days 28-42 transplant . The MMF give twice day central venous catheter 2 hour , mouth . After pre-transplant treatment test finish , blood stem cell transplant . Blood stem cell donor infused 1 hour central venous catheter . This do hospital outpatient basis M. D. Anderson . Steroids Benadryl give catheter stem cell transplant try prevent allergic reaction . The catheter remove long need give fluid , blood product , treatment catheter graft versus host disease . This may take anywhere 3 month transplant several year . You additional blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn , bone marrow aspiration biopsy , chest CT scan , and/or chest x-ray perform need check effect transplant . You transfusion blood platelet need , sign separate consent document transfusion . Blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) also draw least 2-3 time week least 100 day transplant , long study doctor feel necessary . Treatment give hospital outpatient basis M. D. Anderson . You may need stay hospital 3-4 week . You take study disease get bad . This investigational study . The FDA approve drug use study . Their use together study investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
