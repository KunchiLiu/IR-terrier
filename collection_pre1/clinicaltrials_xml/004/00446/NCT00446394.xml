	<detailed_description>This project randomize control trial evaluate efficacy group exercise health promotion program design specifically old adult Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . This study build upon previous study design cognitively intact old adult , supplemental study use modify intervention MCI participant , individual Alzheimer 's disease . Taken together , prior investigation support efficacy behaviorally base exercise intervention improve cognitive , physical , affective status cognitively intact demented old adult . Results feasibility study suggest positive outcome also obtain old adult MCI . The current study investigate efficacy modify exercise program call RALLI ( Resources Activities Life Long Independence ) determine whether effective control condition , social walk program ( SW ) , delay cognitive decline , improve self-rated health health behavior , improve affect physical function , enhance quality life . The long-term efficacy RALLI delay conversion MCI dementia , reduce physical disability , maintain independent living , improve physiological health indicator also investigate . One hundred seventy participant age 70 meet American Academy Neurology criterion MCI recruit independent living retirement residence . Participants randomly assign one two condition ( RALLI SW ) assess baseline , post treatment ( 3 month ) , follow visit every 6 month total 3 year ( month 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 ) . The hypothesis RALLI participant experience good post-treatment outcome SW participant , gain maintain 36 month .</detailed_description>
