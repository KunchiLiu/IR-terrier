	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units give weekly 80,000 Units give every two week anemic patient Low- Intermediate-1 risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Once Weekly Once Every Two Week Dosing Epoetin Alfa Anemic Patients With Low- Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign type treatment chance ) , open-label ( patient physician know treatment give ) , multi-center study approximately 100 anemic patient Low- Intermediate-1 risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) . Patients diagnosis MDS via bone marrow aspirate biopsy accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) Criteria French-American-British ( FAB ) Classification , International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) Low- Intermediate-1 risk disease ( &lt; =10 % bone marrow blast ) , baseline hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 10.0 g/dL [ defined average least 2 measurement ( influence red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion least 1 week ) great equal 1 week apart ] , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units skin ( sc ) weekly ( qw ) 80,000 Units sc every 2 week ( q2w ) . The total study duration 30 week , include 2-week screening phase , 24-week dosing phase , follow-up visit accord patient 's assigned visit schedule , 4-week safety follow-up phase . Beginning Week 13 , every week thereafter , patient assess Erythroid Response . Overall Erythroid Response ( OER ) ( per 2000 International Working Group ( IWG ) Criteria ) include Major Minor Erythroid Responses define : Major Erythroid Response : Having sustain one follow criterion minimum 8 week : &gt; 2 g/dL rise hemoglobin ( Hb ) , OR transfusion independence patient RBC transfusion dependent ( define require 4 red blood cell ( RBC ) unit within 8 week prior first dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) ) baseline . Minor Erythroid Response define : Having sustain one follow criterion minimum 8 week : 1-2 g/dL rise Hb , OR 50 &lt; 100 % transfusion reduction patient RBC transfusion dependent ( define require 4 RBC unit within 8 week prior first dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) ) baseline . Overall Erythroid Response ( OER ) ( per 2006 Modified IWG Criteria ) one secondary endpoint study define : Having sustain one follow criterion minimum 8 week : &gt; = 1.5 g/dL rise Hb , OR Reduction transfusion requirement least 4 RBC unit patient RBC transfusion dependent ( define require 4 RBC unit within 8 week prior first dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) baseline . Only RBC transfusion give Hb &lt; = 9.0 g/dL pretreatment count RBC transfusion response evaluation . Fatigue assessment [ Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) Medical Outcome Survey ( MOS ) Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) ] complete patient baseline ( Day 1/Week 1 ) , Week 9 , Week 13 , end study . In addition , Global Rating Change Level Fatigue ( single-item question ) complete patient Week 13 end study . Safety evaluation perform specified interval study . Hb , hematocrit ( Hct ) , blood pressure monitor weekly . Clinical safety assess incidence severity adverse event , clinical laboratory test ( Hb Hct ) , vital sign physical examination study period . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units give skin week 80,000 Units give skin every 2 week . Dose adjustment make ( i.e. , dose increase decreased , frequency decrease , dos withhold ) response Hb monitoring throughout study order maintain Hb level target range 11 12 g/dL .</detailed_description>
