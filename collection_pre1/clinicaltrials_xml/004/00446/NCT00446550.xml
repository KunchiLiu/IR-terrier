	<brief_title>A Study Oral AT2101 Treatment-naive Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease lysosomal storage disorder result deficiency key enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) . The enzyme deficiency cause genetic mutation , result production misfolded GCase . AT2101 design act pharmacological chaperone selectively bind misfolded GCase help fold correctly , may restore GCase activity . This study conduct test safety AT2101 patient type I Gaucher disease already receive enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) substrate reduction therapy ( SRT ) , receive ERT SRT 12 month screen . This study also evaluate effect AT2101 parameter commonly abnormal Gaucher disease . The study involve 9 visit 29 week .</detailed_description>
