	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Xyotax , conjugate taxane drug paclitaxel , effective treatment prostate cancer longer responsive hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Xyotax Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . Hormonal ablation , form medical surgical castration , cornerstone management metastatic prostate cancer ; however , treatment option patient androgen ablation fails limit . Docetaxel paclitaxel , taxanes cell cycle specific , play major role advance hormone-refractory prostate cancer treatment . In preclinical study , Xyotax , conjugate paclitaxel enhance permeability retention tumor tissue , improve therapeutic profile , decrease systemic drug-related toxicity enhance efficacy . Xyotax single agent study broad variety syngeneic xenogeneic tumor model . Recognizing taxanes active prostate cancer preclinical data report activity Xyotax docetaxel paclitaxel resistant cell line , significant rationale develop agent prostate cancer . Thus , phase II study need evaluate antitumor activity two subset hormone refractory prostate cancer patient : prior systemic one prior systemic therapy .</detailed_description>
