	<brief_summary>ARDS ( Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ) condition severe inflammation excess fluid lung impairs function oxygen uptake point need ventilator ( breathe machine ) help obtain enough oxygen body . Because high amount gas ventilator give patient , high pressure may develop deep lung produce complication patient . However , physician sometimes recognize require special equipment measure pressure deep lung . The goal study determine amount pressure calculate use mathematical formula routine number provide ventilator . The study consist make conventional measurement deep pressure time calculate pressure measurement ventilator routinely provide , see calculate value replace complicated conventional measurement . The measurement do : 1. place small device along tube connect patient ventilator ; 2. give medicine relax muscle ( patient already receive ) ; 3. make ventilator hold patient 's breath second take measurement . This repeat breathe rate ventilator increase decrease mildly . Risks related medicine use measure maneuver rare include transient narrowing windpipe , transiently low heart rate , blood pressure blood oxygen , allergic reaction . This treatment . The information obtain study share treat doctor may find useful make adjustment ventilator . The patient may receive direct benefit study ; however , finding may contribute good care kind patient future .</brief_summary>
