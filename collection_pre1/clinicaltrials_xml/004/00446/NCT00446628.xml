	<detailed_description>Pandemic influenza threaten cause substantial disability , death , societal disruption overwhelm health care system United States around world . Because effective vaccine may available initial month pandemic , anti-viral medication largely ineffective short supply , non-pharmacological personal protection behavioral change may mean combat epidemic . In computational modeling work ( Models Infectious Disease Agent Study network ) , show potential value multiple target layered non-pharmacological intervention blunt peak impact slow pandemic ( Nature , press ) . Phase 1 project pilot study two elementary school City Pittsburgh . The project already obtain agreement collaborate Pittsburgh Public School System assemble multi-disciplinary team epidemiologist , system analyst , modeler , community minority health worker , virologist implement project . Phase one 2 school . Phase 2 similar Phase 1 addition additional school application `` hygiene '' intervention select school family . Phase 2 10 school 3800 student . Specific aim ( year 02 ) : Primary 1 . Measure effectiveness non-pharmaceutical intervention ( NPIs ) reduce influenza rate among enrolled student intervention control school influenza know circulate community . [ Note : Enrolled , purpose PIPP , indicate student present ILI , consent participate , test influenza flu season . ] Secondary : School-Based 2 . Measure number absentee determine reason absence use school base absentee illness surveillance system prior end influenza season . 3 . Measure effectiveness NPIs reduce absenteeism cause , include illness/URI , illness/ILI , illness/other , illness/GI end influenza season . 4 . Measure effectiveness NPIs reduce secondary spread ILI within classroom participate school . 5 . Assess adoption NPI behavior activity classroom intervention school . Secondary : Home-Based 6 . Measure effectiveness NPIs reduce secondary case ILI within family enrol school child influenza . 7 . Assess adherence family enrol school child influenza isolation-related NPI behavior activity . Tertiary 8 . Measure correlation rapid flu test PCR test influenza . 9 . Collect archive influenza specimens future molecular epidemiological study . 10 .
