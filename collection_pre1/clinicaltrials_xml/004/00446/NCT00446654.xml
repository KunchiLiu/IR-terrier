	<detailed_description>The purpose research study determine safe effective subconjunctival injection CGC-11047 subject wet age relate macular degeneration two different dose interval . Half participant study receive CGC-11047 every two week half participant study receive CGC-11047 every four week . If doctor determines eligible study base his/her judgement accord entry requirement set sponsor research , randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) , receive CGC-11047 every two week every four week . Whether receive drug every two week every four week , still need come clinic approximately every two week first three month , approximately four time least 12 month since receive first treatment study drug . Two study ( one another one ) occur test CGC-11047 patient wet age-related macular degeneration first time . However , drug ( CGC-11047 ) study cancer patient dose much high give subject either study . The cancer patient tolerate drug well exception one cancer patient two reaction drug ( pancreatitis hypotension ) . However , patient advance cancer ( non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma life expectancy le 3 month ) receive 38X dose administer AMD study . Aside one patient , serious side effect relate drug . This study involve 100 subject 15 different site internationally . The study take place 12 month include 12 office visit study doctor .</detailed_description>
