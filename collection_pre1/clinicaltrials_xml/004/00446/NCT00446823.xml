	<brief_summary>This clinical trial design evaluate effect XCell cellulose wound dress ability naturally ( autolytically ) remove nonviable tissue create healthy vascular wound bed . Results compare venous ulcer treat Xylos XCell cellulose dress plus standard care treat standard care alone . The hypothesis XCell demonstrate autolytic debridement standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic wound problem patient health care provider . The definition chronic wound one deviate expect sequence repair time , appearance response aggressive treatment . These wound separate distinct class etiology , specifically , pressure , ischemic , venous , neuropathic , diabetic , inflammatory infective wound . The degree severity quite diverse span range superficial epidermal injury full-thickness skin loss extensive destruction , tissue necrosis , damage support structure include muscle , tendon , bone . Treatment chronic wound begin management underlying etiology . For example : In pressure ulcer elimination reduction pressure primary goal ; In venous ulcer , improve venous insufficiency reduce venous hypertension come first ; diabetic foot ulceration , proper load essential . After treatment underlie pathology , one thing chronic wound common require wound bed preparation order stimulate healing process . Most clinical wound care trial evaluate therapeutic agent wound design measure heal primary endpoint . The sequence event begin patient examination , wound classification application test agent . In case , test agent place wound contaminated excessive bacteria , need debridement , require wound bed preparation exudate control . A new wound dressing ( Xylos XCell cellulose wound dress ) unique biosynthetic matrix material hydrophilic excellent tensile strength . It ability deliver moisture wound absorb moisture . This cellulose matrix microbially derive , biocompatible , pyrogen-free completely non-toxic . In previous clinical trial dress display ability aid natural process autolytic wound debridement , cleanse exudate control . From initial observation , appear cellulose matrix provide environment prepares wind bed eliminate nonviable tissue , reduce bacterial burden , control exudate expose healthy granulation tissue . With successful wound bed preparation one concentrate healing chronic wound . This clinical trial design evaluate natural cleansing ( autolytic debridement process ) heal attribute new cellulose wound dress compare standard care ( impregnated gauze ) . Venous ulcer choose model wound often cover thick fibrous non-viable tissue , poorly vascularize , contaminate numerous bacteria exude copious amount wind fluid .</detailed_description>
