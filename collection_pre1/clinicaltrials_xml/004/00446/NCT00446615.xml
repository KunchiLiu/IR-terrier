	<brief_summary>In 2001 , estimate 1.9 million Canadians chronic renal disease number patient treated end stage renal disease climb nearly 20 % 5 year . Many medication commonly use elderly patient excrete kidney . Failure adjust dos impair renal function result medication overdose , lead potentially serious morbidity mortality . Studies hospital long term care facility find 19-67 % rate non-compliance guideline medication dose adjustment patient renal insufficiency ambulatory care one study find 69 % rate non-compliance . Since primary care physicians write 80 % prescription age 65 year , need intervention improve prescribe patient renal impairment primary care . This study develop audit tool electronic decision support tool incorporate electronic medical record large academic family health centre . It see preliminary step project ass effectiveness multifaceted intervention include chart audit , personalize feedback prescribers , pharmacist-facilitated group learn session use electronic decision support tool incorporate electronic medical record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifaceted Intervention Improve Prescribing Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This descriptive study develop pilot test tool multifaceted intervention improve prescribe patient renal impairment primary care . These tool include chart audit tool , development group learn session electronic clinical decision support tool incorporate electronic medical record . Setting : This study conduct Stonechurch Family Health Centre , academic family practice teach site McMaster University . Stonechurch Family Health Centre currently provide primary care 16,000 patient . There three interdisciplinary clinical team include academic community family physician , nurse practitioner , register nurse , RPNs , pharmacist , social worker professional .

OSCAR develop Dr. David Chan colleague benefit integrate clinical practice clinical knowledge deliver necessary tool include pharmaceutical clinical reference point care . OSCAR use Stonechurch since April 2002 transition paper chart electronic record successfully complete practice within practice site Patient Sample Inclusion : Patients age 65 prescribe one target medication creatinine within previous year record include . Exclusions : patient dialysis . Intervention : The propose multifaceted intervention employ combination high low technology strategy . Following pre-intervention chart audit , personalize feedback prescribe practice provide prescribers . This data use design curriculum pharmacist-facilitated group learn session provider dose adjustment patient renal impairment . Principles educational session reinforce electronic medical record decision support tool . The tool consist calculator allow prescribers estimate creatinine clearance . Electronically deliver lab data use populate appropriate field creatinine clearance calculator order improve ease use decision support tool . Users prompt supply miss data advise necessary dose adjustment target medication . The targeted medication already determine consensus panel Centre Evaluation Medicines , McMaster University dose adjustment guideline available utilized another related project improve dose medication long term care set . The list include medication recommend dose adjustment attach ( Appendix 1 ) . Measurements : Targetted prescription : The number prescription write targeted medication collect . Each prescription review categorized appropriate inappropriate examine drug regimen creatinine clearance patient . Two people independently review prescription discrepancy resolve concensus . The appropriateness rating process pilot test . Number patient prescription target drug write , number time electronic decision support tool access time initiation decision support tool electronic prescribing precriotion collect . Prescriber knowledge comfort adjust dos medication measure Likert scale teach session . Prescriber assessement ease use decision support tool measure brief useability survey . Outcomes : The primary outcome change number appropriately write prescription target medication 3 6 month educational intervention introduction clinical decision support tool . Secondary outcome include : - prescribers â€™ perception knowledge comfort adjust dos medication measure Likert scale assessement ease use decision support tool - cost saving - time prescribers use decision support tool - Number time decision support tool use .</detailed_description>
