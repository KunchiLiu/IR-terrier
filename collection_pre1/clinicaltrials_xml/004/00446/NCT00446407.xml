	<detailed_description>The goal research evaluate clinical cost-effectiveness Collaborative Stepped Care intervention treatment Common Mental Disorders ( CMD ) primary care Goa , India . The Collaborative Stepped Care intervention compare Enhanced Usual care cluster randomize control trial 24 primary care facility ; first phase trial locate 12 government run Primary Health Centres , second phase locate 12 private family physician/general practice facility . Approximately 2400 participant screen positive screening questionnaire CMD recruit 24 facility ( harmonic mean 100 per cluster per arm ) 2/3 ICD10 case confirm diagnostic interview ( Revised Clinical Interview Schedule ) . Follow-up interview home conduct independent team 2 , 6 12 month post recruitment . Allowing 25 % attrition follow-up give 650 patient arm confirm CMD , total 960 arm , contribute analysis primary outcome ( see ) . The Collaborative Stepped Care intervention complex intervention comprise follow component : screen detection case ; psycho-education ; antidepressant ; inter-personal therapy ; yoga ; specialist supervision &amp; adherence management . The method delivery base stepped-care model provide treatment accord patient ' need incorporate strategy overcome challenge integration mental health primary care develop country . This compare Enhanced Usual Care comprise screen detection case , provision diagnosis doctor , make antidepressant available facility-all component available Collaborative Stepped care facility well . The intervention deliver two new , full-time , primary care human resources-the Health Assistant ( arm ) screen adult attender ; Collaborative Stepped Care arm , Health Counselor-who train 3 month , part-time Psychiatrist support primary care team . The primary analysis intention-to-treat , regardless adherence intervention , base outcome measure 6 month . All analysis take account within-facility cluster result cluster randomize design , include adjustment a-priori defined confound factor randomization achieve balance two arm baseline . The primary research question answer analysis output : - Does Collaborative Stepped Care Intervention effect outcome Definite Cases ? Prevalence CMD two arm amongst participant International Classification Diseases , tenth edition ( ICD10 ) CMD baseline - Does Collaborative Stepped Care Intervention effect burden CMD amongst patient Possible Cases ? Prevalence CMD two arm screen-positive participant - Does Collaborative Stepped Care Intervention effect outcome Depression Cases ? Prevalence CMD two arm amongst participant ICD10 Depression baseline - Does Collaborative Stepped Care Intervention effect incidence ICD10 CMD amongst Sub-threshold Cases ? Prevalence CMD two arm screen-positive participant ICD10 CMD diagnosis baseline . Secondary analysis include : - Comparison prevalence list 2 month ( measure speed recovery ) 12 month ( sustainability effectiveness ) . - Repeated measure analysis CMD prevalence 2 , 6 12 month , assess effect intervention whole 12 month follow-up period . - Comparisons Revised Clinical Interview Schedule ( CISR ) General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ ) score , World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule ( WHO-DAS ) score continuous outcome ( ) endpoint ; ( ii ) use repeat measure analyse combine information three endpoint . - Interaction gender , education co-morbidity intervention effect - Interaction facility type ( private/public ) intervention effect . - Interaction baseline illness attribution ( somatic/psychosocial ) intervention effect . - Interaction baseline severity CISR score intervention effect - Comparison adverse event two arm 2 , 6 12 month . - Per-protocol analysis : - Adherence minimum intervention ( least one meeting Health Counselor Collaborative Stepped Care arm ) - Adherence optimal intervention-completion intervention-i.e . discharge Health Counselor ; minimum therapeutic dose either antidepressant ( 90 % adherence 90 day ) Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) ( 6 session 4 month ) . - Dose response relationship level adherence For economic analysis , health care cost patient- family-borne cost compute compare 2 , 6 12 month , subsequently relate change health outcome : primary outcome measure depression status also Quality Adjusted Life Years [ QALYs ] . In event dominance show , i.e . intervention effective cost also usual care group , incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compute , together confidence interval ( use bootstrapping technique overcome expect skewness cost data ) . Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve also derive order show probability cost-effective advantage component intervention range 'willingness pay ' threshold level . We also carry nested qualitative evaluation objective ass participant ' perception quality care receive , satisfaction care , reason did/did take full advantage intervention offer , impact health problem daily life , economic productivity life family member . We also explore experience trial participant ( particular , experience inform consent procedure ; reason participation ; understanding randomization ) . Two in-depth interview conduct least 96 participant , first 1 month enrolment second interview 6 month later . A second group in-depth interview carry member intervention team process intervention , successes limitation ( quality care , PHC 's overall function ) future program may address . We aim interview least one doctor facility one Health Counselor PHC ( i.e . total 24 ) . Two in-depth interview conduct staff member , first 2 month initiation program . The second interview conduct 6 12 month initiation trial .</detailed_description>
