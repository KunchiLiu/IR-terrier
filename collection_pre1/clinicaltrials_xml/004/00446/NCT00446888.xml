	<brief_title>Effects Nutritional Supplementation ( Product 4808 ) Acute Skeletal Muscle Protein Synthesis Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle protein generally diminished cancer patient , effect outcome . Research show recurrence treat patient directly relate extent muscle loss . The effect nutritional supplement ; however , still controversial . Anorexia due metabolic change cancer patient lead reduce food intake supplementation orally often fail show weight gain patient . These observation lead conclusion even though food intake increase order gain lean body mass , difficult achieve unless specific metabolic abnormality target . This study comparison two supplement muscle protein synthesis . Approximately 40 patient radiographic evidence cancer , age 40 old enrol . Participation require screen procedure , include history medical problem physical exam , may include blood test HIV hepatitis well possibly various basic diagnostic parameter . There may also urine-based drug screen pregnancy test ( female ) . Participants general good health variety exclusion criterion . There three day diet stabilization , meal come Reynolds Institute Aging . If subject comply diet , dietary recording substitute . Following three day , one day main study activity . There catheter place arm blood sample take one . Stable amino acid isotope infuse bloodstream . There three muscle biopsy take thigh muscle throughout day . Two dos nutritional supplement consume 20 minute apart main study day .</detailed_description>
