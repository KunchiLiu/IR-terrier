	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Fostamatinib Tablets Treat B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label study fostamatinib take place two phase . Phase I Two cohort , 6 patient , sequentially assign receive 200 mg ( Cohort 1 ) 250 mg ( Cohort 2 ) PO bid R788 . Patients enrol 250 mg bid Cohort 2 &lt; 1/6 patient Cohort 1 experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) initial 28-day treatment period . If 2 patient Cohort 1 experience DLT initial 28-day treatment period , patient Cohort 2 receive 150 mg PO bid . Patients experience DLT disease progression may continue treatment assign dose level disease progression , toxicity withdrawal . Patients experience DLT may resume treatment low dose level ( dose decrease 50 mg ) toxicity grade decrease ≤ 1 . Once patient Phase I complete 28 day treatment , optimal dose fostamatinib , base safety anti-tumor activity , determine . Phase II 48 additional patient , 3 group 16 patient , receive fostamatinib optimal biologic dose PO bid tumor progression , limit toxicity withdrawal . Group 1 consist patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , Group 2 consist patient follicular lymphoma , Group 3 consist patient mantle cell lymphoma , mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma , marginal zone lymphoma , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) .</detailed_description>
