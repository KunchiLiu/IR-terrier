	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid reduce atrial fibrillation outcome cardiac surgery . In placebo-controlled trial , patient undergo elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery without valve repair treat omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid perioperatively . The following hypothesis test : 1. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid reduces incidence atrial fibrillation ( AF ) cardiac surgery , 2. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , administer perioperative period cardiac surgery , decrease postoperative complication rate , 3. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid decrease intensive care unit hospital length-of-stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common complication bypass surgery . It significant burden healthcare system associate increased hospital cost longer hospital length-of-stay . Atrial fibrillation occur bypass surgery associate increased morbidity mortality . Atrial fibrillation also associate increase risk stroke , use potentially harmful drug , need pacemaker therapy . This study patient undergo elective bypass surgery . Patients meet study criterion consent participate study randomize treatment omega-3 fatty acid match corn oil placebo , prior surgery . After surgery , treatment continue primary endpoint , atrial fibrillation , reach , 14 day , whichever first .</detailed_description>
