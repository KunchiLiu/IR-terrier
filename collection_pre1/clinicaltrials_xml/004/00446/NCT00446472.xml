	<brief_title>Evaluation Windowed Casts With Without Regranex® Gel Healing Diabetic Neuropathic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management diabetic leg foot ulcer base certain principal : 1 ) effective off-loading pressure wound via specialized shoe , cast brace , cast , 2 ) removal infect necrotic tissue vial surgery non-surgical method , 3 ) optimization wound heal intervention promote wound repair nutritional support , provision optimal moisture balance growth factor therapy . Application cast cast brace [ knee , removable boot protective pad ] protect immobilize ankle foot demonstrate provide superior wound heal less cumbersome type shoe gear ( 1-3 ) . The benefit casting may result effective off-loading pressure achieve device , inability patient remove cast also appear important factor , non-compliance removable cast-braces show pervasive significant issue ( 4,5 ) . One critical concept diabetic foot ulcer management relation chronically limb loss — year wound persist , patient 25 % risk major amputation due complication infection ( 6-8 ) . Limb loss profound effect Diabetics ' quality life rate lower limb loss among diabetic four per 1,000 person year comparison three per 10,000 person year ( 9-10 ) .</detailed_description>
