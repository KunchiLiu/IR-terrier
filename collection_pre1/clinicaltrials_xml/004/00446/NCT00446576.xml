	<brief_title>The Effect Epoetin Alfa Cardiac Function Quality Life Patients With Early Renal ( ( Kidney ) Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use Epoetin alfa treatment anaemia chronic renal failure ( CRF ) patient well accept . The severity anaemia CRF patient increase degree renal dysfunction . Thus , severe degree anaemia generally find patient end stage renal disease must maintain dialysis . Nevertheless , significant number early renal insufficiency patient also see anaemic . Most patient Europe end stage renal disease maintain Hb level 6 8 mmol/l . According survey second European Epoetin symposium ( Creta , 1998 ) 20 % maintain Hb = 8 mmol/l , maintain value low 8 mmol/l . Even 40 % maintain Hb = 6 mmol/l . A number study find relationship leave ventricular hypertrophy haemoglobin dialysis pre-dialysis patient . Also relation LVH morbidity mortality find . For reason suggestion treat anaemia towards high level . To treat Hb high level choice make correct Hb drop low level renal disease reach advanced stage alternatively prevent anaemia early stage renal disease . In analysis normal hematocrit trial , Macdougall Ritz suggest latter . This main purpose trial . Treatment Epoetin alfa also make patient feel well physically exercise capacity improve . During treatment Epoetin alfa , several secondary effect may simultaneously influence maximal exercise capacity correction anaemia . The improved well-being may result increase physical activity exercise capacity improve conditioning . The improved oxygen transport correction anaemia reverse circulatory adaptation hypoxia study show decrease cardiac output rest , increase peripheral resistance . However , approximately one-third chronic renal failure patient treat Epoetin alfa episode hypertension , may require increased dos anti-hypertensive medication . This prospective study ass whether maintain Hb level normal sub-normal level influence health status , leave ventricular mass quality life ( QoL ) early renal insufficiency subject without additional safety concern . The patient receive Epoetin Alfa subcutaneous intravenous injection variable dosage maximum 42 month</detailed_description>
