PROTOCOL NO . UAB NEPHROLOGY 001-2006 SPONSOR : University Alabama Birmingham , Birmingham , AL 35294 NAME OF FINISHED PRODUCTS : Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors , Angiotensin Receptor Blockers , Fabrazyme® INVESTIGATOR/STUDY CENTERS : Fourteen ( 14 ) study site worldwide PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether decline GFR slow titrate ACEI/ARB anti-proteinuric therapy target urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , 50 % reduction baseline , Fabry patient significant kidney involvement ( 20 ≤ eGFRMDRD ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² ) , baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 ( base last value obtain initiate ACEI/ARB therapy obtain screen first Evaluation Visit FAACET Study ) , receive standard care treatment Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) , Fabry disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine whether urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , ≥ 50 % reduction baseline , safely achieve Fabry patient ACEI/ARB therapy . 2 . To determine whether urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0 . 5 , ≥ 50 % reduction baseline , result slow rate GFR decline compare patient achieve target . 3 . To determine GFR decline slow titrate ACEI/ARB therapy target urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , 50 % reduction baseline , Fabry patient definite kidney involvement ( 125 ≥ eGFRMDRD ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² ) , baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 ( base last value obtain initiate ACEI/ARB therapy obtain screen first Evaluation Visit FAACET Study ) receive standard care treatment Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) , Fabry disease . METHODOLOGY This multi-center , multinational , open-label study confirm safety effectiveness ACE inhibitor ARBs proteinuria patient advance Fabry disease receive Fabrazyme® 1 mg/kg every week . Following initial 3-month Evaluation Period , ACEI/ARB therapy titrate reduce urinary protein/creatinine ratio target 0.5 , 50 % baseline level , patient follow 24 month Observation Period continue monitor eGFRMDRD protein excretion every 3 monthly 24 month . ACEI/ARB therapy continue titrate maintain proteinuria target Observation Period . The baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio define last value obtain individual patient begin ACEI/ARB therapy . STUDY SITES : 40 patient enrol FAACET Study 14 Study Sites . INCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient must provide write , informed consent , ≥ 19 yrs age . The patient already receive Fabrazyme® 1 mg/kg every two week time enrollment . Patient confirm Fabry disease ( plasma αGAL activity &lt; 1.5 nmol/hr/mL , leukocyte αGAL activity &lt; 4 nmol/hr/mg ) , know mutation compatible Fabry disease . Patients either : 1. eGFRMDRD ≥ 20 ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 , document baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 , base last value obtain initiate ACEI/ARB therapy obtain screen first Evaluation Visit FAACET Study ; 2. eGFRMDRD ≤ 125 ml/min/1.73 m2 &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 document baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1 , base last value obtain initiate ACEI/ARB therapy obtain screen first Evaluation Visit FAACET Study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient undergone kidney transplantation currently dialysis , plan receive kidney transplant first year study . The patient diabetic nephropathy presence another , confound kidney disease unless kidney biopsy confirmation patient diabetic nephropathy another , confound kidney disease . The patient clinically significant organic disease , condition opinion investigator would preclude participation full extent trial . The patient unwilling comply requirement protocol , include continue Fabrazyme® 1 mg/kg body weight every two week . Patients documented allergy ACE inhibitor ARBs eligible participate FAACET Study . The patient pregnant intend become pregnant course study . TREATMENT REGIMEN During Evaluation Period , patient titrate ACEI/ARBs reduce first morning urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , 50 % baseline level . During Observation Period , ACEI/ARB therapy dose-adjusted , tolerate , maintain urine protein/creatinine ratio target level . Patients continue receive Fabrazyme® intravenously every 2 week throughout study . Unless compel clinical indication , patient FAACET study avoid potentially nephrotoxic agent ( e.g. , NSAIDs , aminoglycoside antibiotic , X-ray contrast agent , etc . ) STUDY DURATION : 3 month Evaluation Period , follow 24-month Observation Period . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION Efficacy : Change renal function assess eGFRMDRD FAACET patient , compare Phase IV patient population ( AGAL008 AGAL025 ) assess additional impact ACEI/ARB therapy decline eGFRMDRD patient receive Fabrazyme® therapy . Patients every receive Fabrazyme least 12 month AGAL008/AGAL025 Phase III/extension study include Control Cohorts : ) . eGFRMDRD ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 Baseline initiate treatment Fabrazyme® , OR b ) . Baseline eGFRMDRD ≤ 125 ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² , urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 Baseline initiate treatment Fabrazyme® . These patient use analysis comparison FAACET Study patient base characteristic initiate Fabrazyme® . Safety : Safety monitor term adverse experience , vital sign parameter , physical examination , laboratory safety parameter , concomitant medication antibody formation . DSMP DSMB : A Data Safety Monitoring Plan develop FAACET Study , Steering Committee assume responsibility usually attribute Data Safety Monitoring Board . A summary log keep adverse event report UAB IRB . STATISTICAL METHODS Efficacy : The primary efficacy analysis change renal function assess eGFRMDRD patient group reach maintain urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , ≤ 50 % baseline , assess impact ACEI/ARB therapy decline eGFRMDRD patient receive Fabrazyme® therapy . A secondary efficacy analysis carry change eGFRMDRD patient group maintain urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5 , less 50 % baseline . The Phase III/Phase III extension Phase IV/Phase IV extension patient , meet Criteria evaluation list , serve Control Cohorts comparison FAACET patient various analysis . The Control Cohort define priori FAACET enrollment begin . The age , gender , baseline eGFRMDRD , systolic blood pressure , baseline proteinuria , well duration Fabrazyme® therapy versus appropriate mixed model random slope individual patient . The mixed model analysis adjust need covariates assume important determine rate decline kidney function ( i.e . age , gender , baseline eGFRMDRD , systolic blood pressure , baseline proteinuria , duration Fabrazyme® therapy ) . Safety : Adverse event serious adverse event summarize body system preferred term use standardized coding dictionary ( MedDRA ) . The severity relationship treatment adverse event summarize . Clinically significant laboratory value , physical exam finding summarize . Overall antibody status , include seroconversion rate , titer level summarize .
