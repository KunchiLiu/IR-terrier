	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety chronic treatment inhale dry powder mannitol subject cystic fibrosis . Previous study demonstrate improvement lung function relate small airway obstruction significant improvement respiratory symptom quality life 2 week treatment mannitol . This current study seek support early finding extend evidence support use mucoactive therapy cystic fibrosis . In particular , hypothesis enhance mucus clearance improve lung function clinical presentation population , investigate . We also hypothesize enhanced mucociliary clearance result sustain reduction mucus load , thus provide less opportunity bacteria proliferate , afford reduction antibiotic use hospitalization . The initial 6 month blind phase follow additional 6 month open label treatment .</brief_summary>
