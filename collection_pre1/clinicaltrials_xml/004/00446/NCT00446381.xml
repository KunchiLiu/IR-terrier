	<brief_summary>Patients proliferative diabetic retinopathy clinically significant diabetic macular edema require surgical intervention receive pre-operative injection Macugen . An initial , pre-injection vitreous tap do order provide baseline VRGF 165 cytokine level . At onset vitrectomy , second vitreous sample take obtain intra-operative level Macugen , VEGF 165 cytokine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes one leading cause blindness North America . Diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) characterize disruption normal microvascular circulation retina result production neovascularization increase microvascular permeability . Similarly , clinically significant diabetic macular edema CSDME ) result loss central visual acuity . Many patient condition , despite treatment , go develop vitreous hemorrhage tractional change require surgical intervention ( ) vitrectomy and/or vitrectomy membrane peel attempt restore vision prevent visual loss re-establish normal macular anatomy improve patient visual acuity . Although multiple etiologic factor involve early change see diabetic retinopathy maculopathy , show VEGF primary angiogenic growth factor implicate development neovascularization PRD increase vascular permeability , result CSDME . VEGF level find correlate tightly extent diabetic retinopathy introduction VEGF normal primate eye induce diabetic retinopathy . Although several isoforms VEGF exist , isoform 165 ( VEGF 165 ) pathogenic form VEGF therefore inhibition VEGF 165 may play significant role modulate diabetic retinopathy maculopathy . Macugen VEGF antagonist ( anti-VEGF pegylated aptamer ) bind VEGF 165 high specificity affinity . In vitro pharmacology study show Macugen bind amino acid isoform VEGF 165 inhibits bind cellular receptor . As consequence , Macugen block signal event disrupts cascade proliferative vascular permeability response associate bind VEGF 165 endothelial cell . This effect clearly proven Phase 3 trial patient age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , result inhibition vascular development decrease vascular leakage . Although diabetic retinopathy represent different challenge AMD , underlie pathogenic factor similar role effect VEGF . Regression retinal neovascularization Macugen therapy diabetic individual show . Phase 2 study complete Phase 3 study currently underway patient diabetic macular edema evaluate efficacy Macugen restore vision patient CSDME . These study ongoing exclude patient vitrectomy perform plan near future due tractional effect macula epiretinal membrane vitreomacular traction syndrome . No study do date patient PDR CSDME quantify reduction intravitreal VEGF 165 level patient follow intravitreal Macugen injection evaluate effect VEGF 165 blockade neovascular regression surgical outcome patient extensive diabetic proliferative neovascularization . The goal study quantify reduction intravitreal VEGF 165 level patient follow intravitreal Macugen injection pre-operatively determine level Macugen vitreous cavity variable time interval ( 2,4 , 6 8 week ) .</detailed_description>
