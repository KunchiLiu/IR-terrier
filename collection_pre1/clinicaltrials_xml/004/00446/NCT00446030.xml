	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label , multicenter , pilot study safety efficacy two Docetaxel-based regimen plus bevacizumab adjuvant treatment participant node positive high risk node negative breast cancer . The primary objective study evaluate cardiac safety , secondary objective evaluate safety toxicity participant treat bevacizumab ± trastuzumab administer 2 different docetaxel-based combination regimen . This study originally design also evaluate disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ; however , base protocol amendment , follow-up shorten 10 year 2 year , efficacy endpoint disease free survival overall survival delete protocol .</brief_summary>
