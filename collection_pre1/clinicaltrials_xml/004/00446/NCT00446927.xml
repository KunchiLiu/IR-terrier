	<brief_summary>The current method evaluate surgical repair surgery limit echocardiography ( noninvasive diagnostic procedure use ultrasound study structure motion heart ) invasive procedure call cardiac catheterization . The SPY imaging system make use fluorescence property indocyanine green ( ICG ) obtain high quality image blood vessel . ICG green dye use test heart output . The use SPY imaging system surgery may provide valuable information regard successful vessel connection area remain unblocked . This study compare result image echocardiography conventional angiography result . With SPY imaging , congenital heart surgeon would able check quality procedure revise , redo perform additional procedure dictate image patient leaf operate room .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPY Imaging System : Its Role Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It would advantageous detect potential problem vessel anastomotic patency prior leave operating room . The SPY imaging system make use fluorescence property Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) obtain high quality image blood vessel . Unlike conventional angiography , indocyanine green fluorescence image offer potential reliable , non invasive , inexpensive rapid method intraoperative assessment vessel anastomotic patency . This type image resource could invaluable repair : 1. coronary artery re-implantation follow arterial switch procedure transposition great artery , anomalous coronary artery pulmonary artery repair , aortic root replacement , 2. coarctation aorta , 3 . Blalock-Taussig shunt , right-ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt , cavopulmonary connection single ventricle palliation , 4. branch distal pulmonary artery reconstruction/unifocalization tetralogy Fallot pulmonary atresia/ventricular septal defect . The SPY imaging system feasible variety congenital heart defect provide valuable information regard vessel anastomotic patency . Specific Aim 1 : Evaluate quality image clarity ability visualize desire anatomic area Specific Aim 2 : Compare result image echocardiography conventional angiography result - Part 1 . Compare result pre-repair intra-operative SPY image preoperative echocardiography result , cardiac catheterization result available - Part 2 . Compare result post-repair intraoperative SPY image postoperative echocardiography result , cardiac catheterization result available Approximately 40 patient total enrol study - 10 undergone coronary reimplantation , 10 undergone repair coarctation aorta , 10 undergone palliative shunting procedure , 10 undergone pulmonary artery reconstruction . Echocardiography : Preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative cardiac catheterization report analyze . Cardiac catheterization : Preoperative postoperative cardiac catheterization report analyze . SPY imaging : ICG green administer follow dos : 1.25 mg infant ( &lt; 1 year ) , 2.5 mg child ( &lt; 16 year ) , 5 mg adult size patient ( 17-18 year age ) . Doses injected 1 ml volume directly aorta , right ventricle pulmonary artery , depend upon procedure . Repeat dose imaging may perform need . The total dose dye limit 2 mg/kg . Images obtain operating room prior commence wean cardiopulmonary bypass .</detailed_description>
