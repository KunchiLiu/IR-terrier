	<brief_summary>This research study investigate effect proton pump inhibitor ( often use treat stomach upset ) Gleevec® ( drug FDA-approved treat type cancer ) healthy volunteer . Twelve healthy volunteer ( six men six woman ) recruit complete study . This research study compare Gleevec® body take without proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) . Each volunteer receive 400 mg pill Gleevec® two occasion . On one occasion take dose Gleevec® alone ( without PPI ) . On another occasion , take Gleevec® take 40 mg PPI daily mouth six day . Several blood sample draw measure concentration Gleevec® breakdown product blood , without influence PPI .</brief_summary>
