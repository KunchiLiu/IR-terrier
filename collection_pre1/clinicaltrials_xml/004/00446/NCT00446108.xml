	<brief_title>Retrospective Pulmonary Valve Replacement Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect component pulmonary stenosis ( narrow ) often palliate childhood disrupt pulmonary valve . This arrangement provide excellent quality life child grow enter young adulthood . Unfortunately , pulmonary insufficiency create disrupt pulmonary valve result volume overload right heart . This may eventually lead right ventricular dilation irreversible right heart failure . In addition , volume load right heart may affect inter-ventricular septum leave heart function well . Placement competent pulmonary valve subsequent operation , hopefully time without replacement valve size constraint present initial operation , mean eliminate volume overload prevent sequela . Unfortunately , optimal timing subsequent pulmonary valve replacement controversial . One currently use indication valve replacement include right ventricular leave ventricular volume ratio great two . However , determine boundary right ventricle echocardiography magnetic resonance image difficult absence pulmonary valve . The boundary determine arbitrary estimation pulmonary valve . Other potential indicator pulmonary valve replacement may right ventricular area right ventricular strain , determine echocardiography . These measurement affect absence pulmonary valve . They may provide good marker impend right ventricular failure simpler mean follow serial improvement follow valve replacement . While emphasis pulmonary valve disruption typically lie right ventricle , evidence leave ventricle may become impaired well . Volume load right ventricle cause bow inter-ventricular septum affect leave ventricular function . Echocardiographic imaging leave ventricle may also important follow serial improvement leave heart follow pulmonary valve replacement . All chart review patient surgery Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Emory University Hospital January 1 , 1994 December 31 , 2006 . We review approximately 125 patient ' chart patient age 1 65 year age require pulmonary valve replacement .</detailed_description>
