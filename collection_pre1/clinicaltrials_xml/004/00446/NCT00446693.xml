	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation Evaluate Safety Performance EndoFast Reliant™ System Vaginal Wall Reinforcement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Pelvic Organ Prolapse represent significant problem worldwide may significant negative impact woman 's quality life . The uterus , rectum bladder hold normal position inner end vagina `` hammock '' make supportive muscle ligament . Wear tear supportive structure pelvis allow uterus , bladder , bowel , vaginal vault rectum sag muscle ligament layer . When occurs , rectum , uterus , bowel bladder create bulge vagina . In severe case , possible sag rectum , uterus , bowel bladder work way far enough bulge appear vagina 's open even protrude open . Pelvic Organ Prolapse cause significant discomfort patient associate urinary incontinence , void difficulty culminate urinary retention , constipation , pain sexual intercourse , local discomfort , etc . Treatment Options When symptom occur , many patient initially opt conservative treatment . Pelvic exercise vaginal support current mainstay non surgical management . In addition , patient poor surgical candidate strongly disincline surgery offer vaginal support ( pessary ) symptom relief . Topical estrogen important adjunct conservative management patient Pelvic Organ Prolapse . However , primary management strategy severe Pelvic Organ Prolapse surgical . The exact treatment choice depend severity prolapse whether related pelvic floor defect . Endogun Medical Systems Ltd. develop innovative , minimally-invasive system repair Pelvic Floor Prolapse . The EndoFast Reliant™ system new concept reinforce vaginal wall proprietary system comprise mesh soft tissue fastener minimally-invasive way . The fastener deploy easily swiftly narrow space soft tissue support substantially weight need Pelvic Organ Prolapse repair . Following many pre-clinical test , EndoFast Reliant™ system available clinical evaluation . The objective study evaluate safety performance EndoFast Reliant™ system treatment Pelvic Organ Prolapse . In particular : - The study 's primary goal clinically assess safety EndoFast Reliant™ minimally-invasive procedure vaginal wall reinforcement . - The study 's secondary goal clinically evaluate performance EndoFast Reliant™ system minimally-invasive procedure vaginal wall reinforcement evaluate improvement Pelvic Organ Prolapse use POPQ grade system . Study Procedures Follow : Pre-treatment test inspection perform within 4 month prior surgery . Approximately two week , three month six month surgery patient invite physician examination laboratory test . Additional Study Measures : In addition endpoint parameter , follow study measure collect : - Symptoms relief Quality Life ( QOL ) consideration . - Sexual Function consideration , document use Female Sexual Function ( FSFI ) questionnaire ; - Assessment physician 's satisfaction .</detailed_description>
