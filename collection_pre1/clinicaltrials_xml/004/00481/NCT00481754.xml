	<brief_summary>Background : - Endometrial cancer ( cancer line uterus ) common gynecologic cancer United States . - Currently , marker ( component blood tissue determine might risk develop cancer ) endometrial cancer . Objectives : -To see woman undergo hysterectomy willing provide blood tissue sample help doctor identify marker would indicate increase risk develop endometrial cancer . Eligibility : -Women 35 54 year age undergo hysterectomy non-cancerous condition , uterine fibroid , uterine prolapse , abnormal uterine bleeding , others Magee-Women 's Hospital Pittsburgh , Penn . Design : - Patients ' medical record review patient complete questionnaire include information race ethnic background , education , marital status , family history , height , weight , pregnancy history , smoke history , medication history , history menstrual period menopausal symptom . - Patients provide blood urine sample surgery . - A sample fat tissue remove surgery patient undergo abdominal surgery . - Tissue sample remove uterus ( ovary ovary also remove ) collect analyzed marker endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis silent molecular lesion , define molecular alteration detectable histologically normal endometrial , ovarian , tubal tissue , represent marker cancer risk . Incessant ovulation represent one widely-recognized model explain pathogenesis ovarian cancer , woman high number lifetime ovulatory menstrual cycle increase cancer risk repeat ovulation-related injury , repair , ovarian surface epithelium ( OSE ) . This extremely delicate single layer cell exfoliate easily handle , majority cell typically lose routine handling , collect post-operatively . Furthermore , identification early stage ovarian cancer uncommon , vast majority ovarian cancer associate recognizable precursor . The lack effective technique collect study OSE laboratory represent major barrier molecular study design uncover etiology early pathogenesis ovarian cancer . This proposal develop collection method OSE , demonstrate utility various molecular analysis . Recent evidence suggest subset ovarian cancer may originate fallopian tube . Therefore , pilot collection cell fallopian tube . If successful , collection OSE fallopian tube cell provide basis large study aim identify early molecular event ovarian carcinogenesis . In pilot , collect endometrial ovarian tissue ( would otherwise discard without histopathologic examination ) 125 hysterectomy and/or unilateral bilateral oophorectomy specimen obtain woman age 18 older operate benign indication . As amendment active protocol , propose demonstrate feasibility obtain intra-operative cytobrushings ovarian surface epithelial cell 50 woman accrue onto study , include woman hysterectomy ( unilateral oophorectomy ) alone without removal ovary time surgery . Furthermore , extend collection cell fallopian tube 120 woman total population 295 , also enrol woman ovarian cancer . We administer questionnaire assess endometrial ovarian cancer risk factor gynecologic history ; obtain blood urine ; obtain carefully-mapped frozen fix endometrial ovarian tissue . We immunostain endometrial tissue assess presence , number , location , size focus contain PTEN-null gland , represent validated surrogate mutation PTEN tumor suppressor gene . This pilot demonstrate feasibility execute complex protocol ; determine number space section require accurately efficiently assess PTEN status endometrium ; provide data develop power estimate need propose full-scale study sufficient number subject test hypothesis PTEN abnormalities account substantial proportion risk associate recognize epidemiologic endometrial cancer risk factor . It assess feasibility perform molecular analysis ovarian surface epithelial cell tubal cell collect intra-operatively , correlate molecular finding know ovarian cancer risk factor . If successful , provide basis large study aim identify early molecular event ovarian carcinogenesis , particularly set woman increase genetic risk ovarian cancer . The pilot also provide extremely valuable repository future biomarker pilot study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion include : 18 year age older : benign condition subject decide hysterectomy ( removal uterus ) , perform abdominal incision ( open procedure ) laparoscope ( minimally invasive procedure ) . The hysterectomy perform without removal tube , ovary cervix . benign cyst ovary ( ) subject decide remove , without removal entire ovary . The surgery do either abdominal incision ( open ) laparoscope ( minimally invasive procedure ) . positive test BRCA 1 2 gene , put subject increase risk breast cancer , subject decide undergo surgery ( either abdominal incision laparoscope ) remove uterus , tubes ovary , combination diagnosis ovarian cancer possible ovarian cancer subject advise undergo hysterectomy ( removal uterus ) , removal tubes ovary combination , abdominal incision laparoscope . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence gross examination surgically remove uterus carcinoma invade myometrium ; however , postoperative diagnosis early endometrial carcinoma cause posthoc exclusion specimen data collection . We exclude woman previous gynecologic gastrointestinal cancer . At discretion surgeon , exclude woman cancer study procedure may interfere clinical management ( e.g . stag cancer ) . We exclude woman neoadjuvant chemotherapy woman underwent chemoprevention ovarian breast cancer . We also exclude woman currently wear intrauterine device .</criteria>
