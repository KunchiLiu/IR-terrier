	<detailed_description>Sperm analysis base sperm count motility employ diagnosis male fertility several decade . It easy , inexpensive useful tool determine fertile status male still significant number infertile male normal sperm feature , determine basic sperm analysis , remain unable reach full-term pregnancy ( 1 ) . This fact clearly indicate need develop new male infertility test accurately diagnose sperm sample individual . Recent investigation sperm mRNA content describe relevance sperm mRNA stock fertilization early embryo development several specie . ( 2 ) Although sperm quiescent cell translational point view , several functional mRNAs deliver oocyte fertilization , synthesize earlier phase spermatogenesis process find ( 3 , 4 ) . The fertile male transcriptome ( stock mRNAs within sperm male able progeny ) already describe ( 5 , 6 ) , confirm expression thousand sequence tag different intensity expression . Moreover , several investigation demonstrate differential expression key mRNAs find infertile male comparison fertile male ( 1 , 7 ) . Nevertheless , information available neither characteristic stock sperm mRNAs infertile male difference fertile infertile men , although several author hypothesize sperm microarray analysis future male infertility diagnosis ( 2 , 8-11 ) . Microarray technology provide information wide range mRNAs expression within single experiment , permit analyze complete sperm expression profile ( SEP ) cell tissue . Bioinformatics help organization amount result follow logical process gene expression grouping , analyze statistically finding . Our aim work compare SEP spermatozoon obtain male idiopathic infertility versus sperm donor prove fertility employ microarray technology follow functional analysis , order determine gene , sequence biological process involve sperm physiology different infertile vs. fertile male .</detailed_description>
