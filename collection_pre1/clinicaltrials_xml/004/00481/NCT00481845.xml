	<brief_title>Phase 2 Anastrozole Vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) Neoadjuvant Treatment Postmenopausal Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use adjuvant chemotherapy endocrine therapy significant impact breast cancer survival . However , patient benefit therapy . Increasing data suggest patient hormone receptor-positive breast cancer derive marginal benefit addition adjuvant chemotherapy . Identification characterization cellular signal pathway active pathogenesis breast cancer lead development multiple target therapy hold enormous promise patient less toxicity conventional chemotherapy . Treatment strategy employ neoadjuvant therapy find pCR predictive ultimate outcome . Due , use neoadjuvant therapy become intense area investigation operable breast cancer . In IMPACT trial , aromatase inhibitor anastrozole find improve eligibility breast conservation associate favorable clinical objective response 12 week therapy . In proposed study , plan study combination ZD6474 , dual inhibitor EGFR VEGFR-2 , anastrozole neoadjuvant setting patient Stage I-III breast cancer . The aim overcome mechanism resistance simultaneously block multiple critical signaling pathway know stimulate breast cancer . The two agent non-overlapping toxicity administer orally , allow tolerable treatment regimen . By use combination neoadjuvant setting , target critical signaling pathway early follow tumor response therapy , allow prompt evaluation effectiveness treatment strategy . Pathologic tumor specimen obtain time definitive surgery evaluate pathologic complete response thus add body literature . By examine molecular marker ER , PR , EGFR , Ki-67 pre- post-treatment , hope correlate modulation biomarkers response . Finally , use novel second generation functional breast MRI investigate ability MRI predict response antiangiogenic therapy .</detailed_description>
