	<brief_summary>Over past 30 year much learn molecular genetics natural history familial form hematuria . However , enhance understanding condition yet generate effective therapy Alport syndrome , form familial hematuria associate end-stage renal disease . Males Alport syndrome inevitably develop end-stage kidney failure , 50 % likelihood dialysis kidney transplantation age 25 year . There proven treatment Alport syndrome , although study animal suggest several promising potential therapy . Potential drug treatment might delay prevent development kidney failure exist , need evaluate clinical trail . Conducting clinical trail propose treatment Alport syndrome present many challenge . Because Alport syndrome common disease , informative clinical trial require collaboration investigator multiple center . The University Minnesota , Department Pediatrics , propose create Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcomes Registry ( ASTOR ) order facilitate clinical trial treatment Alport Syndrome . This registry first kind North America . Because Alport syndrome rare disorder , recruitment sufficient participant meaningful therapeutic trial require multicenter effort . The primary objective establish sustain registry enable clinical natural history study therapeutic trial conduct child adolescent Alport syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : ASTOR envision permanent organization sustain private philanthropic public funding source . Recruitment participant registry consist three approach . First , pediatric nephrologists United States Canada invite participate ASTOR . Activities participate investigator include identification recruitment potential study participant , collection transmission participant data ASTOR central office University Minnesota , implementation study protocol . Participating physician inform participant parent ASTOR invite participate writing . The correspondence include instruction contact ASTOR personal formal participation . Participants parent ask permit share personal health information ASTOR central office . Second , ASTOR central office develop website participant family . The website provide participant family medical new research information instruction contact registry staff registry participation . Potential participant contact central office ask give consent ASTOR staff contact health care provider . Third , University Utah School Medicine 's Department Nephrology , currently hold data pertain approximately 350 family report history Alport syndrome . Department investigator agree provide information ultimately assist ASTOR staff execute recruitment activity provide historical medical health information pertain natural progression disease current treatment practice contact patient exist database determine individual family interested participate registry . This information use support analysis effort may come result new study develop implemented aegis registry . Selection Enrollment Participants Each consent participant assign unique identifier enter ASTOR database , along demographic data , health information urine analysis result . Referring physician home institution also assign unique identifier . ASTOR coordinator contact participant 's physician provide instruction complete detailed baseline questionnaire design capture follow information : Family history - X-chromosomal inheritance - Autosomal inheritance - Mode inheritance unknown - Mode inheritance know : Which person family is/was effect ( indicate family tree ) , symptom ( hear defect , ocular abnormality , renal disease , leiomyomatosis ) ? - At age diagnosis Alport syndrome make effect family member ? - If family member end stage renal failure , age ? Individual data treat participant - At age diagnosis Alport syndrome make ? - Has skin biopsy perform ? If yes , list result . - Has kidney biopsy perform ? If yes , list result . - Has molecular-genetic diagnosis/ mutation analysis perform ? Clinical data progress disease • Medications age med start Recruitment participant registry consist three approach . First , pediatric nephrologists United States Canada invite participate Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcomes Registry ( ASTOR ) . Activities participate investigator include identification recruitment potential study participant , collection transmission participant data ASTOR registry 's central office University Minnesota . Second , ASTOR central office develop website participant family . The website provide participant family medical new research information instruction contact registry staff registry participation . All policy procedures information sample share , store bank ASTOR central office prepare accordance University Minnesota Office Information Technology standard secure private data ( see data safety monitoring plan ) . Urine sample collect ASTOR central office . Instructions material collect mail specimen provide participant . Third , University Utah contact exist patient base determine individual family interested participate registry ( IRB approval seek contact potential participant ) . Interested participant refer ASTOR central office . Interested individual family contact write formal participation . ASTOR central office staff obtain informed consent form participant ( telephone consent IRB approval pending ) . Participants see every six month assessment . Clinical assessment include initial baseline questionnaire urine sample follow bi-annual update medical medication history urine analysis . Medical medication history complete participant 's provider urine sample forward participant University Minnesota 's central office testing . Contractual agreement process urine sample establish in-state laboratory . Data Collection Site Monitoring Data Collected Study Personnel : 1 . Participant consent study ( include participant parental consent , participant assent appropriate ) 2 . Baseline Questionnaire bi annual medication medical update c. Baseline urine sample repeat bi annually Participant 's medical clinical data urine analysis result submit ASTOR central office multiple source . Our goal participant 4 month would complete study data ( acknowledgement consent , complete baseline questionnaire urine sample result ) data entry ASTOR central office data base . Performance completion component participant participant safety implication . • Data accuracy : For participant , data enter match hard copy questionnaire lab result . Opportunities error minimize elimination need re-copy data multiple location . Copies source document file double locked environment . • Data Confidentiality : Every participant assign unique identify registry number . These unique participant identifier keep within individual participant folder . These participant folder keep file lock , study specific personnel access . Participant data computer database accessible study personnel require require password . Participant specific information include publication presentation local national meeting conference . • Data Use : Registry participant data regard medical history , urine analysis , demographic data use define categorize participant future research study . Participant inform intend use sign formal consent participate future research endeavor may develop implement . The database also useful provide study personnel specific date ensue visit begin baseline subsequent bi-annual evaluation . No one outside immediate study staff access participant data , password protection place study computer reduce chance breach confidentiality . There may occasional request investigator outside immediate study personnel share information . Information provide investigator accordance University Minnesota Data Monitoring Safety policy .</detailed_description>
