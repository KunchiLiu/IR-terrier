	<detailed_description>TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION USING TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Rationale : Depression tDCS Major depression disorder major clinical economic significance locally internationally . It disorder high prevalence result substantial disease burden health-care cost . Critically , significant percentage patient , usually estimate around 30 % , fail respond standard treatment ( Fitzgerald 2003 ) . Techniques repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) investigate widely treatment disorder considerable success recent year ( Fitzgerald , Benitez et al . 2006 ) ( Hasey 2001 ) . However , TMS equipment expensive require specialist application . Additionally , TMS associate side-effects . Given depression occur culture country , would considerable value develop low-cost , non-invasive technique apply wide variety setting , include Third World . RTMS base treatment depression base understanding abnormality activity frontal brain region disorder ( George , Ketter et al . 1994 ; Fitzgerald , Brown et al . 2003 ; Speer , Kimbrell et al . 2000 ) . High-frequency stimulation increase brain activity usually apply left prefrontal cortex way increase activity , although previous literature somewhat inconsistent . In contrast , low-frequency stimulation decrease brain activity apply right prefrontal cortex reduce activity region . Both technique therapeutic efficacy ( Fitzgerald , Brown et al . 2003 ) . Recent study , include conduct research group , suggest combination two approach also effective ; potentially effective either one use independently ( Garcia-Toro , Salva et al . 2006 ; Fitzgerald , 2006 ) . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) novel , non-invasive non-convulsive technique alter brain function ( Ardolino , Bossi et al . 2005 ) . It involve application small current ( usually 1 2 mA ) anodal cathodal electrode place scalp ( Miranda , Lomarev et al . 2006 ) . Typically , increase neuronal excitability occur anode , decrease cathode , probably respective depolarisation hyperpolarisation neuron ( Miranda , Lomarev et al . 2006 ) . It show safe number experimental clinical trial ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ; Nitsche , Liebetanz et al . 2003 ; Lang , Nitsche et al . 2004 ; Boggio , Castro et al . 2006 ) . Most research tDCS investigate use modify cognitive function experimental neuropsychology . However increase use technique therapeutic trial disorder chronic pain , tinnitus motor impairment post-stroke ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) . Research also begin tDCS treatment depression ( Nitsche 2002 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) . In first study patient randomise active sham stimulation ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) . Anodal stimulation apply left prefrontal cortex . This result statistically significant improvement depressive symtomology , relative sham condition . As sensation produce tDCS usually disappear completely 30 second , sham use study involve turn device 30 second turn . A second study group include 30 patient submit publication . It also show statistically significant antidepressant effect active treatment group , relative sham stimulation . Importantly , substantial side-effects report either two clinical trial ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) . Both two study depression use anodal stimulation apply leave prefrontal cortex . The cathode place position leave eye propose contribute antidepressant efficacy stimulation . We propose slightly different protocol involve anodal stimulation leave prefrontal cortex placement cathode right prefrontal cortex . This ensure activate stimulation leave deactivate stimulation right quite similar sequential bilateral rTMS technique test . There reason presume associate great rate side-effects , may enhance therapeutic efficacy . General Study Design : The propose study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled ( i.e. , sham tDCS ) , longitudinal , treatment outcome trial . Individuals depression randomize 1 2 treatment condition . These : 1 . Active 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) : condition , 1 stimulator use anodal stimulation leave prefrontal cortex cathodal stimulation right prefrontal cortex . The placement anodal stimulation propose enhance activity leave frontal cortex ; cathode aim reduce activity right prefrontal cortex . 2 . Sham treatment : system set condition one stimulate turn 30 second . A total 15 treatment administer participant 3 week ( one per work day ) . Individuals randomize computer-generated list information store central computer treat physician aware treatment allocation patient . It anticipate stratified randomization sample accord potentially clinically significant variable age , sex , illness treatment duration would dramatically increase required sample size beyond scope study . Therefore , chosen . Nonetheless , base descriptive statistic , multiple linear regression perform adjust significant clinical predictor . Clinical raters patient blind treatment condition . The following primary hypothesis test . - Hypothesis 1 : Active tDCS improve depressive symptomology significantly great degree sham treatment . - Hypothesis 2 : Active tDCS well tolerate free major side effect . Subjects : 50 patient depression recruit participate study . - Participants include : ( 1 ) Are competent consent ; ( 2 ) diagnosis Major Depression currently experience Major Depressive Episode confirm Structure Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID-IV ) ; ( 3 ) treatment resistant , defined failure achieve clinical response , inability tolerate , antidepressant trial sufficient dose least 6 week ; ( 4 ) age 18 75 . Concomitant medication include : ( 1 ) benzodiazepine , ( 2 ) mood stabilizer ( lithium , valproic acid ) ( 3 ) antidepressant ( include serotonin reuptake inhibitor tricyclic antidepressant ) anticholinergic allow . Since carbamazepine show interfere effect anodal tDCS , potential participant take suitable inclusion trial . - Patients exclude : ( 1 ) Have DSM-IV history substance abuse dependence last 6 month ; ( 2 ) Have concomitant major unstable medical neurologic illness ; ( 4 ) currently take carbamazepine ; , ( 3 ) pregnant . - Finally , patient withdraw study : ( 1 ) withdraw consent ; ( 2 ) experience significant clinical deterioration ; ( 3 ) fail tolerate procedure ; , ( 4 ) develop serious adverse event . In event patient withdrawn drop study , effort make obtain final set clinical , cognitive neurophysiological measure time withdrawal last observation carry forward analysis . Transcranial direct current stimulation : Site , Intensity Frequency : Direct current transfer pair saline soak sponge electrode ( contact area 5 x 7cm ) , deliver specially develop , battery driven constant current stimulator . The electrode place F3 F4 accord 10-20 international system EEG placement . This show relatively accurate method dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) localisation neuronavigation method ( Herwig , Padberg et al . 2001 ) , use tDCS study target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) . Safety : tDCS previously use multiple study area post-stroke rehabilitation , Parkinson 's disease depression , adverse sequela note ( Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2005 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ; Fregni , Boggio et al . 2006 ) ( Nitsche , Liebetanz et al . 2003 ; Lang , Nitsche et al . 2004 ; Boggio , Castro et al . 2006 ) . The procedure produce mild tingle sensation initially usually completely resolve within 30 second . Sham Condition : Sham stimulation make use stimulation parameter site active treatment , current turn 30 second . Typically , tDCS induces itch tingle sensation first 30 second application , fade , make appropriate method blinding . Course : The primary study 3 week duration . Therefore , participant receive 15 treatment lasting twenty minute , conduct daily week day . Patients assess baseline 3 week abbreviate assessment first 7 day treatment ( MADRS ) . Patients sham group offer open label active treatment end . Patients respond tDCS also follow post treatment assessment monthly interval possible assess duration response . Patients achieve significant response tDCS may offer 'repeat ' treatment request follow symptomatic relapse . Symptoms : Symptoms depression assesed 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD ) . Other outcome measure include Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Beck Depression Questionnaire ( BDI ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) interview record subjective experience tDCS adverse event . Cognition : The primary outcome measure performance forward backwards digit span ( assessment verbal work memory ) block spatial span ( spatial work memory ) test . In addition , aspect prefrontal cognitive functioning assess use N-back task , Tower London planning task , FAS verbal fluency task trail make task ( A &amp; B ) . These additional task include assess whether treatment rTMS result specific change work memory broader domains prefrontal cognitive functioning . In addition , baseline assessment premorbid intellectual functioning conduct use Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - 3rd edition ( WAIS-III ) . Electroencephalography : Where possible ( base laboratory availability ) EEG record tDCS assess effect tDCS alpha , beta , delta , theta gamma power band use standard 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system use many study group . Analysis We use series repeat measure ANOVA model assess change depressive cogntive symptom time group . There data base smaple size calculation : plan large sample use rTMS tDCS trial conduct interim analysis recruitment 20 patient re-estimate sample size . THE TREATMENT OF WORKING MEMORY AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Rationale : Schizophrenia tDCS Schizophrenia ( SCZ ) debilitate disease affect approximately 1 % population . Measured economic sense , cost Australian government estimate 2.25 billion Australian dollar per annum [ 1 ] . A significant proportion burden carry individual schizophrenia stem negative symptom social withdrawal impaired executive functioning . Current treatment schizophrenia , include new atypical antipsychotic agent , effective treat positive symptom schizophrenia , demonstrate limited efficacy treat negative symptom . There need new therapeutic option people schizophrenia treat aspect illness . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) novel , non-invasive non-convulsive technique alter brain function . It involve application small current ( usually 1 2 mA ) anodal cathodal electrode place scalp . Typically , increase neuronal excitability occur anode , decrease cathode , probably depolarisation hyperpolarisation neuron , respectively [ 2 ] . It show safe number experimental clinical trial [ 3 ] therapeutic benefit find use treatment depression , pain disorder , tinnitus motor impairment post stroke [ 4 , 5 ] . In depression , one study show therapeutic effect compare sham stimulation group second positive study 40 patient currently review . This clearly show antidepressant effect tDCS great sham side effect . In fact , side effect previous trial limit mild transient sensation itch tingle underneath site electrode [ 4 ] . Previous study show transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) [ 6 , 7 ] , another technique neuromodulation , may effective treat positive negative symptom schizophrenia . However TMS high frequency require increase brain activity physically uncomfortable due induction scalp muscle twitch associate potential seizure induction . tDCS considerably cheap TMS , approximately one tenth cost , associate few side effect may role play alleviate disease burden people schizophrenia . Negative symptom , prefrontal cortex short term memory A number study find association negative symptom include blunted affect executive function cognitive deficit reduce activation prefrontal area , particularly leave prefrontal cortex . [ 8-14 ] . Biltaeral dorsolateral leave prefrontal cortex dysfunction associate short term memory deficit schizophrenia [ 15 ] . Application tDCS leave prefrontal cortex show improve short term memory [ 16 ] . As , treatment tDCS would appear potential improve short term memory deficit individual schizophrenia , also may positive impact negative symptom . General Study Design : The propose study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled ( i.e. , sham tDCS ) , longitudinal , treatment outcome trial . Individuals SCZ randomize 1 2 treatment condition . These : 1 . Bilateral 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) : condition , 2 stimulators use anodal stimulation prefrontal cortex cathodal stimulation temporoparietal cortex ( TP3 EEG site ) . The placement anodal stimulation propose enhance activity bilateral frontal cortex potentially improve negative cognitive symptom . Bilateral rTMS design reduce cortical activity appear improve negative symptom [ 17 ] . The cathode , reduce cortical activity , place temporoparietal cortex : site propose hyper-active positive symptom schizophrenia include hallucination possibly delusion think disorder [ 18-22 ] . rTMS reduces activity ( analogous cathodal stimulation ) show reduce symptom , especially hallucination ( example [ 1 , 23 , 24 ] ) . Thus , electrode arrangement , anticipate potential treatment positive cognitive / negative symptom simultaneously . This would possible brain stimulation technique target one site ( e.g . rTMS ) . 2 . Sham treatment A total 15 treatment administer participant 3 week ( one per work day ) . Individuals randomize computer-generated list information store central computer treat physician aware treatment allocation patient . It anticipate stratified randomization sample accord potentially clinically significant variable age , sex , illness treatment duration would dramatically increase required sample size beyond scope study . Therefore , chosen . Nonetheless , base descriptive statistic , multiple linear regression perform adjust significant clinical predictor . Clinical raters patient blind treatment condition . The following primary hypothesis test . - Hypotheses 1 : Bilateral tDCS improve work memory subject schizophrenia - Hypothesis 2 : Bilateral tDCS reduce negative symptom subject schizophrenia . - Hypothesis 3 : Bilateral tDCS reduce positive symptom subject schizophrenia . Subjects : 50 patient SCZ recruit participate study . - Participants include : ( 1 ) Are voluntary competent consent ; ( 2 ) diagnosis Schizophrenia Schizoaffective Disorder confirm Structure Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID-IV ) ( 3 ) persistent positive negative symptom despite trialled , currently medicate , antipsychotic medication ; ( 4 ) age 18 65 . Concomitant medication include : ( 1 ) benzodiazepine , ( 2 ) mood stabilizer ( lithium , valproic acid ) ( 3 ) antidepressant ( include serotonin reuptake inhibitor tricyclic antidepressant ) anticholinergic allow . Since carbamazepine show interfere effect anodal tDCS , potential participant take suitable inclusion trial . - Patients exclude : ( 1 ) Have DSM-IV history substance abuse dependence last 6 month ; ( 2 ) Have concomitant major unstable medical neurologic illness history seizure ; ( 4 ) currently take carbamazepine ; , ( 3 ) pregnant . - Finally , patient withdraw study : ( 1 ) withdraw consent ; ( 2 ) experience significant clinical deterioration ; ( 3 ) fail tolerate procedure ; , ( 4 ) develop serious adverse event ( e.g. , seizure activity , active suicidal ideation ) . In event patient withdrawn drop study , effort make obtain final set clinical , cognitive neurophysiological measure time withdrawal last observation carry forward analysis . No restriction inclusion make base baseline WM performance . This allow u study broad range spectrum WM performance well effect tDCS performance potentially normal well impaired . Data available memory impairment general suggest ~80 % patient SCZ perform median within sample patient control [ 25 ] suggest likely unselected sample patient SCZ , highly likely see significant majority WM performance mean control subject . Transcranial direct current stimulation : Site , Intensity Frequency : Direct current transfer pair saline soak sponge electrode ( contact area 5 x 7cm ) , deliver specially develop , battery driven constant current stimulator . The anode electrode place F3 accord 10-20 international system EEG placement . This show relatively accurate method dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) localisation neuronavigation method [ 26 ] , use tDCS study target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ 4 , 16 ] . The cathodal electrode place left temporal area ( TP3 EEG site ) . Twenty minute 2mA stimulation apply regime previously show enhance work memory population Parkinson 's disease level 2mA [ 4 ] . The procedure also apply right side . Safety : tDCS previously use multiple study area post-stroke rehabilitation , Parkinson 's disease depression , adverse sequela note . [ 4 , 5 , 16 , 27 ] . The procedure produce mild tingle sensation initially usually completely resolve within 30 second . Sham Condition : Sham stimulation make use stimulation parameter site active treatment , current turn 30 second . Typically , tDCS induces itch tingle sensation first 30 second application , fade , make appropriate method blind [ 5 ] . Course : The primary study 3 week duration . Therefore , participant receive 15 treatment lasting twenty minute , conduct daily week day . Patients assess baseline 3 week abbreviate assessment first 7 day treatment ( PANSS ) . Patients sham group offer open label active treatment end . Patients respond tDCS also follow post treatment assessment monthly interval possible assess duration response . Patients achieve significant response tDCS may offer 'repeat ' treatment request follow symptomatic relapse .
