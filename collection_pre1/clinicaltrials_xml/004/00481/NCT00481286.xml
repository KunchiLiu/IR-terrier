	<brief_title>Improving Outcomes Using Collaborative Group Clinics Empower Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among person age 55-84 year , 65 % one three common medical condition ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes , arthritis , stroke , heart disease , etc. ) . Fortunately , large randomize clinical trial demonstrate effectiveness treatment prevention strategy many chronic condition ( e.g. , dietary modification medication hypertension , intensive glucose monitoring diet medication regimens diabetes , etc. ) . Despite significant finding numerous clinical trial , old person continue suffer uncontrolled hypertension , hyperglycemia , predictor poor health outcome . Non-compliance clinical guideline provider ( i.e . clinical inertia ) non-adherence doctor ' recommendation typically blame unacceptably poor outcome . For old adult several condition , process patient-clinician collaboration well understood . Goal-setting behavior may improve health care link desire outcome ( i.e. , reduce risk heart attack ) goal care ( i.e. , salt restriction hypertension control ) . Furthermore , process goal-setting may effective patient internalize importance particular goal prioritize goal among multiple clinical problem ( i.e. , hypertension care patient diabetes . Effective method implement collaborative goal train patient negotiate share goal goal-directed behavior clinician develop diabetes control . The effectiveness method may enhance use clinic enroll small group subject rapid follow-up several week . Group clinic demonstrate improved outcome common chronic condition . Evidence demonstrate synergistic benefit efficient group clinic collaborative goal-setting limited . However , approach combine methodology may provide improved method rapidly control multiple chronic condition maintain control chronic condition prolong time period . To address gap implementation effective efficient medical care , develop test model collaborative group clinic empowers older patient adopt goal-setting behavior , increase communication health care provider , improve diabetes-related outcome . The objective use collaborative group clinic : 1 ) Improve diabetes process care outcomes 3 month time period ; 2 ) Significantly improve maintenance diabetes process care improvement 12 month time period ; 3 ) Significantly improve use self-management behavior diabetes care .</detailed_description>
