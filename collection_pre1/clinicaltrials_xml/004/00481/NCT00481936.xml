	<brief_title>Study Safety VB6-845 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours Epithelial Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objective Phase 1 trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) VB6-845 evaluate safety tolerability VB6-845 administer monotherapy intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( 3 hour ) , weekly 4-week cycle , subject EpCAM positive advance solid tumour epithelial origin . Secondary objective include evaluate pharmacokinetic profile immunogenicity VB6-845 assess exploratory efficacy VB6-845 . Dose cohorts 3-6 subject EpCAM positive advance solid tumour epithelial origin enter study . The start dose define 1.00 mg/kg , 1/10 observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) reach preclinical study . Doses escalate accord modify Fibonacci design 2 3 2 6 subject experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) . The MTD reach &lt; 2 6 subject experience DLT . An additional 12 subject enrol MTD characterization VB6-845 level . Regardless dose cohort , subject continue receive treatment unacceptable toxicity occur , lesion completely disappear disease progression determine .</detailed_description>
