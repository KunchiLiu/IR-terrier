	<brief_summary>This collaborative study National Cancer Institute , Columbia University , Southern Urals Biophysics Institute Russia . It examine relationship difference certain gene development chromosomal abnormality worker Mayak nuclear production plant Ozyorsk , Russia . This population expose high radiation dose external internal source receive counterpart country consider permissible today . If risk relationship find genetic difference chromosome abnormality , information might useful study design examine high radiation exposure cause cancer . Radiation-exposed Mayak worker employ 1948 1972 three Ozyorsk plant directly relate nuclear weapon production may eligible study . They must remain local resident area estimate external internal radiation exposure must available . Participants provide blood sample genetic study answer questionnaire include demographic information information family health history , history benign tumor , , history smoking alcohol consumption . Additional information collect patient ' medical record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Greater understanding role individual variation response radiation exposure might clarify inconsistent relationship radiation dose , intermediate marker induce DNA damage , subsequent cancer risk . REB propose collaborate Columbia University Southern Urals Biophysics Institute elucidate contribution germline genetic variation frequency chromosomal aberration cohort Russian nuclear worker notable atypical radiation exposure . Our collaborator utilize new biodosimetry method , term mBAND , measure intra-chromosomal aberration , potentially useful biomarker exposure high linear energy transfer radiation plutonium . In addition , assess inter-chromosomal aberration use mFISH ( multicolor fluorescent insitu hybridization ) . As factor radiation dose may influence aberration frequency , REB propose add DOE-funded study investigation germline genetic variation DNA repair gene relation aberration risk . Mayak nuclear worker ( n = approximately 350 ) employ 1948-72 receive short questionnaire blood sample drawn receive routine annual medical exam . Germline genotype assess risk factor chromosome aberration frequency . In study , opportunity address scientific question regard radiation carcinogenesis mechanism relatively little cost population rare , high dose exposure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA EXPOSED POPULATION : Individuals eligible include 'exposed ' population include employ 19481972 three plant directly relate nuclearweapon production ( nuclear reactor , radiochemical production plant , plutonium production plant ) , remain local resident , estimate external gamma dose internal plutonium exposure . Some eligible worker plutonium exposure , still eligible include exposed sample due external radiation exposure . All participant require cancerfree time enrollment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA EXPOSED POPULATION : Individuals medical history radiation therapy blood transfusion within previous year exclude . As sample size would adequate examine risk separately , Tartars Bashkirs include study . INCLUSION CRITERIA COMPARISON GROUP : The comparison population drawn current former worker auxiliary plant ( water treatment facility mechanical repair plant ) Mayak facility . Included stratified random sample worker employ 19481972 , remain local resident , estimate external gamma dose . Individuals select frequencymatched accord age ( 5 year age group ) gender expose worker population .</criteria>
