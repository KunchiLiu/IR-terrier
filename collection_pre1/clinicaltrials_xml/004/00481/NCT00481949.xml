	<brief_summary>Monitoring oesophageal pH provide definitive diagnosis patient gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) , especially association reflux symptom uncertain consideration anti-reflux surgery . Standard ambulatory investigation normally perform naso-oesophageal catheter however associate considerable discomfort turn alter behaviour reduces reflux provoke activity . Furthermore result catheter base ambulatory pH study compromise high variability acid exposure patient suspect GORD . Prolonging pH measurement catheter-free Bravo™ system 24 48 96hrs significantly improve consistency ( reliability ) reproducibility diagnosis base oesophageal acid exposure , well ability associate acid reflux symptom episode . This improve diagnosis especially intermittent symptom . However pH monitoring provide direct assessment underlie pathophysiology . Incompetence oesophago-gastric junction ( OGJ ) relate disruption structure function consider important cause GORD . A relevant assessment reflux barrier may distensibility ( i.e . ease OGJ open allow retrograde passage gastric content ) ; however assess current clinical investigation . Endo-FLIP ( Crospon Medical Devices ) new tool ass OGJ structure function , appear provide relevant information regard distensibility competence . This study apply use Endo-Flip record OGJ distensibility Bravo record acid exposure symptom association patient reflux symptom . The variability pH measurement symptoms diagnostic accuracy assess 96hrs . Endo-FLIP result compare Bravo . The outcome post investigation therapy compare Endo-Flip Bravo result assess baseline test predict outcome acid suppression therapy . Study Hypothesis 1 . There positive , continuous association OGJ distensibility measure Endo-FLIP % acid exposure assess prolonged Bravo pH monitor 2 . The result Endo-FLIP prolong Bravo predict treatment outcome trial proton pump inhibitor therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Gastro-esophageal Reflux Using Endo-Flip v Bravo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre study patient ( n=60 ) refer investigation reflux symptom . Each patient investigate Endo-FLIP™ , endoscopy , 96 hour Bravo™ pH monitoring acid suppressant medication . After calibration Endo-FLIP catheter insert orally nasally liquid-filled compliant bag distal segment catheter ( house 16 impedance sensor ) straddle OGJ . Stepwise bag distension 10 , 20 30 ml conduct associated intra-bag pressure measure . The Endo-FLIP display allow real-time image OGJ intra-luminal geometry distension . Intra-bag pressure CSA impedance planimetry segment best localize within OGJ report mean ± SEM . An endoscopy perform confirm position squamo-columnar junction ( SCJ ) . Images take SCJ use standard white light narrow band image . Then 2 x 2 biopsy SCJ 2 cm proximally take . In conclusion , Bravo® delivery system pass orally patient lie left lateral decubitus position capsule deploy 6 cm proximal SCJ 1 minute suction stabilize position . After 2 measurement 48 hour ( separated battery change ) patient return receiver final download analysis . In addition pH measurement symptom documentation 96hr period , pepsin lateral flow test ( Technostics , Hull , UK ) perform collect expectorate saliva return lab day 2 day 4 . Patients also provide two kit use experience symptom 4 day study . The primary outcome assessment oesophageal acid exposure percent time pH &lt; 4 measurement period ( e.g . 24 , 48 96h ) . Other parameter analyse number reflux event association event symptom record Bravo™ receiver . The presence absence pepsin expectorate saliva also assess . All subject complete quality life assessment ( SF-36 ) . Symptom severity assess baseline follow-up document validated questionnaire ( Eraflux ) resumption routine acid reduce therapy . Those undergo anti-reflux surgery also follow 3 6 month . LOS distensibility measurement use Endo-FLIP also collect diagnosed achalasia manometry order use reference value Bravo study . Patient symptom review baseline treatment six week return back onto standard acid reduce medication . Patients refer anti-reflux surgery review 3 6 month procedure . This prospective study 60 consecutive patient refer investigation typical reflux symptom ( power calculation allow comparison 24hr vs. 48hr pH test ) . Analysis Bravo : 1 . Retrospective analysis : Formal statistical analysis pH symptom database collect prospectively last 4 year ( contain &gt; 200 Bravo pH study ) . This establish correlation pH result 24 , 48 96hr monitoring clinical variable ( e.g . severity reflux symptom , symptom association ) outcome ( e.g . response PPI , response fundoplication ) . 2 . Prospective analysis : The day-to-day variability pH measurement calculate . Patients classify acid exposure ( abnormal : &gt; 4.2 % time pH &lt; 4 ) symptom index ( positive SI : &gt; 50 % association reflux event symptom ) 24hr 48hr test period . The reproducibility accuracy 24hr vs. 48hr pH test assess 96hr result reference standard . Endo-Flip : Stepwise bag distension 10 , 20 30 ml conduct associated intra-bag pressure measure . The Endo-FLIP display allow real-time imaging OGJ intraluminal geometry distension . The primary outcome assessment OGJ distensibility intra-bag pressure cross-sectional area impedance planimetry segment best localize within LOS mean ± SEM consecutive volume distension . The correlation OGJ distensibility oesophageal acid exposure assess . The correlation interaction OGJ distensibility , acid exposure , reflux-symptom association symptom characteristic ( e.g . severity predominant symptom ) baseline treatment assess co-variant regression analysis .</detailed_description>
