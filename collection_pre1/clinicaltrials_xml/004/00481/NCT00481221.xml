	<brief_summary>β thalassemia autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy consider widespread genetic mutation . According World Health Organization ( WHO ) 1.5-7 % world population carrier disease , every year 60,000-400,000 birth new patient report . In Israel , incidence carrier β thalassemia around 20 % among Jewish Kurdish origin around 5-10 % among Arab population . β thalassemia severe disease require many resource , medical financial . The disease express chronic hemolytic anemia require regular blood transfusion every 3 week . As result blood transfusion iron absorption digestive tract , patient suffer severe hemosiderosis main mortality cause disease , mainly second decade life . Daily treatment iron chelator require . Moreover , despite actual treatment , quality life patient still low . Therefore implementation prevention program include find effective inexpensive way identify β thalassemia carrier humanitary publicly important goal . In β thalassemia carrier , laboratory test show hypochromic microcytic anemia . Those finding similar iron deficiency anemia , RBC number RDW normal thalassemia carrier . Few researcher try past determine cutoff point diagnosis β thalassemia carrier different formula . We use algorithm SVM ( support vector machine ) find reliable formula separate patient Iron deficiency anemia/ healthy patient β thalassemia minor ( carrier ) . This formula insert automatic blood counter search suspect carrier without deliberately intention without blood test .</brief_summary>
