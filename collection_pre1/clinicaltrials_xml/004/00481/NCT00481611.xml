	<brief_summary>Background : - Trichloroethylene ( TCE ) solvent use many medical industrial process . - TCE carcinogen ( cause cancer ) rat , carcinogenicity human unclear . There evidence increase liver kidney cancer association non-Hodgkin lymphoma study worker expose TCE . - The carcinogenicity regulation TCE matter continue debate . Objectives : - To determine TCE exposure associate high level genetic aberration certain white blood cell call lymphocyte . - To determine TCE exposure affect lymphocyte subset level certain hormone call cytokine . Eligibility : Workers expose two different level exposure TCE unexposed worker Guangdong Province , China . Design : - 45 worker expose 25 part per million ( ppm ) TCE , 30 worker expose 10 less 25 ppm TCE 45 unexposed worker enrol . - Subjects wear small instrument work measure chemical air 1 2 day 2-week study period . Exposed worker also wear several small skin patch one two day . - Subjects provide blood urine sample . - Subjects answer questionnaire work , smoke drinking , use medicine , medical history , general health , hobby , exposure radiation exposure various substance home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trichloroethylene ( TCE ) industrial solvent use degreasing , dry cleaning , numerous medical industrial process . It ubiquitous environmental contaminant drinking water present many EPA Superfund sit . TCE rodent carcinogen carcinogenicity human unclear . There evidence elevation liver kidney cancer somewhat convince evidence association non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) epidemiological study occupationally expose cohort . Overall , carcinogenicity TCE regulation matter continue debate despite extensive database vitro vivo animal study several cohort case-control study . IARC categorize TCE probable human carcinogen . In order address question TCE 's potential carcinogenicity mechanism action human , propose conduct cross-sectional study early biologic effect biomarkers genotoxicity immunotoxicity 45 worker expose great 25 ppm TCE , 30 worker expose 10-25 ppm TCE , 45 unexposed control Guangdong Province , China . We assess TCE exposure level quantitatively , collect exposure information questionnaire , collect biological sample , assay series biomarkers susceptibility , intermediate early biologic effect . Our primary goal determine TCE exposure increase chromosomal aberration peripheral lymphocyte , secondary goal determine TCE alters level key cytokine plasma change lymphocyte subset ratio . In addition , collaborator UC Berkeley apply new generation cytogenetic molecular technique study TCE 's ability cause specific type chromosomal aberration associate NHL related hematological malignancy well impact TCE mRNA expression proteome . The work compliment previous ongoing OEEB study population expose TCE potential make important contribution little known early biologic effect TCE human .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A total 45 worker expose great 25 ppm TCE , 30 worker expose 10 less 25 ppm TCE , 45 unexposed worker enrol . We identify 45 worker 3 factory expose great 25 ppm TCE . Our colleague Guangdong NPCC visit potential study factory carry air measurement TCE , epichlorhydrin , methylene chloride , perchloroethylene benzene . Factories select use TCE degreasing process , minimal coexposures present part workplace TCE use , use stable manufacturing process past five year . Workers choose work part factory TCE exposure , work least one year factory job part manufacture process , expose genotoxic , hematotoxic , immunotoxic compound workplace . We enroll 45 control , history occupational exposure TCE genotoxic , hematotoxic immunotoxic chemical . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History cancer , chemotherapy DNAdamaging immunotoxic agent , medical treatment ionize radiation .</criteria>
