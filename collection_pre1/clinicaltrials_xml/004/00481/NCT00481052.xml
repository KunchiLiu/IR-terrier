	<brief_summary>Treating Ph po CML Imatinib effective since majority patient achieve complete cytogenetic response major molecular response alive progression-free 5 year . However , great majority respond patient leukemia-free may risk progression , molecular , cytogenetic clinical , time . In case disease progression due Imatinib failure , nilotinib find effective , expect preclinical profile drug , much potent BCR-ABL inhibits nearly imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutant . For reason , nilotinib go register treatment imatinib-resistant CMl patient . For reason , nilotinib expect efficient imatinib also front-line , base principle aim prevent emergence resistance well treat resistance emerge . This expectation test safely , `` toxicity profile '' Nilotinib may even convenient Imatinib , due low frequency edema fluid retention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nilotinib First-line Treatment Ph+ CML Early Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Phase : Phase II , Prospective , multicentric , non randomize , open label Objectives : The primary objective trial investigate cytogenetic molecular effect protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitor nilotinib treatment early chronic phase Ph+ CML . The secondary objective : To investigate early CP Ph+ CML patient treat nilotinib clinical hematologic effect , effect bcr/abl point mutation , kinetic response , toxicity , compliance treatment dose density . Study design : This study open-label , multicenter , exploratory , Phase II study nilotinib administer orally twice daily one year . For patient benefit extension 4 year plan . Visit Schedule Assessments : A visit blood count differential serum chemistry due baseline , every 15 day 3 month , hence every 30 day . An ECG due baseline , 15 30 day , hence 60 , 90 , 150 , 240 360 day . An echocardiogram due baseline end-of-study ( 360 day ) early withdrawal . A bone marrow aspirate due baseline ( cytology , cytogenetics quantitative molecular biology ) , 3 6 month ( cytology cytogenetics ) 12 month ( cytology , cytogenetics , quantitative molecular biology mutational analysis ) . A peripheral blood sample due baseline , 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 , 270 360 day quantitative molecular biology . After end study ( i.e . one year ) clinical , cytogenetic molecular data due every 6 month . Biologic Monitoring : Bone marrow peripheral blood cell collect , end study , store central lab Bologna use molecular assay list detail protocol , exclusion test allow identification patient genotype . The sample keep minimum 10 year destroy upon patient request . A specific consent form sample storage submit patient .</detailed_description>

Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption nilotinib ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) Use therapeutic coumarin derivates ( i.e . warfarin , acenocoumarol , phenprocoumon ) . Acute chronic liver renal disease consider unrelated leukaemia Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , active uncontrolled infection ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol Patients currently receive treatment medication list Appendix E treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug .
