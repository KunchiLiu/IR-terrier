However , subsequent study demonstrate exaggerated neo-intimal hyperplasia stented segment frequently lead instent restenosis . This condition great importance increase number stent implantation procedure last year . Repeated PTA instent restenosis perform revascularisation patient , gold standard treatment instent restenosis unknown rate recurrence repeat treatment instent restenosis remain high . The concept cut balloon seem appeal indication , balloon-mounted microtome guarantee smooth lumen gain within stent , without risk vessel wall perforation ( due protect effect stent outer limit microtome ) . Initial report use cut balloon treatment occlusive atherosclerotic disease SFA show promising result , indicate problem elastic recoil residual stenosis due arterial dissection might resolve . The cut balloon four tiny microtome ( &lt; 0.1mm height ) outside , cut fibrous plaque expansion balloon . Consequently problem elastic recoil ideally address , additionally less trauma exercise vessel wall dilatation balloon . This might achieve reduction vessel wall trauma , vessel wall inflammation consequently reduce neointimal formation . The cut balloon use pre-dilatation diameter slightly less target vessel diameter , still cut fibrous plaque , desire target vessel diameter achieve final touch dilatation standard angioplasty balloon . In coronary artery cut balloon use randomize study compare CB-PTCA PTCA , well trial treatment in-stent restenosis . All trial demonstrate safety efficacy cut balloon , large randomize trial fail proof superiority conventional PTCA . Data peripheral artery least scarce . Although indication CB-PTA SFA include significant residual stenosis in-stent restenosis , currently publish randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare PTA vs. cut balloon angioplasty ( CB-PTA ) specific condition . This lack data lead u initiate RCT compare primary PTA vs. CB-PTA treatment in-stent restenoses patient intermittent claudication critical limb ischemia TASC category A-B femoropopliteal artery . The primary endpoint occurrence restenosis ultrasonographic reduction vessel lumen diameter &gt; 50 % within 6 month endovascular treatment . In addition , course postintervention inflammation indicate serum level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , serum amyloid A ( SAA ) fibrinogen assess . STUDY DESIGN , INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA . Patients in-stent restenosis ( ultrasonographic stenosis &gt; 50 % vessel lumen diameter ) prior PTA Stent placement SFA enrol single-center prospective RCT . The protocol approve institutional ethic committee patient provide write informed consent enrollment . Entry criterion include symptomatic peripheral artery disease intermittent claudication ( Fontaine stage IIa b ) , critical limb ischemia relate recurrent stenosis previously stented segment 20 cm length . Exclusion criterion history intolerance anti-platelet therapy , adverse reaction heparin , bleed diathesis , creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL , hemodialysis , active bacterial infection , allergy contrast medium , pregnancy disability give inform consent . FOLLOW-UP . ABI test , treadmill exercise , Duplex-sonography treat vessel perform patient 1 , 3 , 6 month treatment . A peak systolic velocity â‰¥ 2.4 consider indicative &gt; 50 % narrowing define indicative restenosis10 . Reintervention surgical bypass treat segment also define restenosis loss primary patency . An improvement least one Fontaine category baseline use define clinical success association maintenance least 0.15 increase exercise ABI preprocedure level . COMPLICATIONS classify either major minor ( describe Appendix A ) . Major complication e.g . bleeding puncture side hematoma decrease serum hemoglobin 2 g/dl , loss stent artery , vessel rupture , amputation , macroembolisation need revascularisation life threaten bleeding complication . STUDY ENDPOINTS . The primary study endpoint occurrence &gt; 50 % restenosis treat segment 6 month post-intervention determine duplex ultrasound ( in-segment restenosis ) . Secondary objective primary technical success rate ( residual stenosis &lt; 30 % without need secondary stent implantation , primary assist secondary patency , clinical patency , target vessel target lesion revascularization , cardiovascular adverse event 1 , 3 , 6 month procedure . Furthermore , course inflammatory parameter assess .</detailed_description>
