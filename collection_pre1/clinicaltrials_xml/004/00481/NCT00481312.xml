	<brief_summary>Patients ICU need help breathing put onto machine call ventilator also give medicine , call sedative , helps sleep make comfortable . Midazolam sedative routinely used purpose . For patient aim sedation make sleepy still able respond nursing staff ( light sedation ) Dexmedetomidine new sedative use intensive care clinical study , dexmedetomidine compare midazolam . It think dexmedetomidine might slightly well allow patient sleepy still respond people around . It also appear affect patient 's breathing . purpose study test whether dexmedetomidine really advantage compare midazolam . study hope show : dexmedetomidine least good midazolam help patient sleep well make comfortable , able co-operate good staff treating , patient treat dexmedetomidine require shorter time ventilator treat midazolam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Versus Midazolam Continuous Sedation Intensive Care Unit ( ICU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III , multi-centre , prospective , randomised , double-blind , double-dummy , active comparator study . The study consist three period : screening , double-dummy treatment follow-up period . All patient admit ICU pre-screened accord inclusion exclusion criterion prior inform consent use available clinical data . Informed consent , screen randomisation procedure complete within 72 hour time admission ICU within 48 hour start continuous sedation . Eligible study subject require light moderate sedation ( Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [ RASS ] = 0 -3 ) randomise either continue midazolam switch dexmedetomidine . Patients receive continuously regularly administer sedative agent midazolam infusion last 12 hour except opioid analgesic . Study treatment titrate achieve individually target sedation range determine daily basis . Rescue treatment ( i.e . propofol boli ) may give need achieve target depth sedation . Continued need sedation assessed daily sedation stop , conducted time day . First sedation stop may 12-36 hour randomisation , depend time day study subject randomise . The duration study treatment limit maximum 14 day randomisation . Following withdrawal sedation , study subject monitor 48 hour contact telephone 31 45 day randomisation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year Clinical need sedation initially intubate ( tracheotomised ) ventilate ( inspiratory assistance ) patient Prescribed light moderate sedation ( target RASS = 0 3 ) use midazolam infusion Patients randomise within 72 hour ICU admission within 48 hour commence continuous sedation ICU Patients expect requirement sedation least 24 hour time randomisation Written inform consent must obtain accord local regulation start study procedure prescreening . Acute severe intracranial spinal neurological disorder due vascular cause , infection , intracranial expansion injury Uncompensated acute circulatory failure time randomisation ( severe hypotension MAP &lt; 55 mmHg despite volume pressor ) Severe bradycardia ( HR &lt; 50 beats/min ) AVconduction block IIIII ( unless pacemaker instal ) Severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin &gt; 101 µmol/L ) Need muscle relaxation time randomisation ( may use intubation initial stabilization ) Loss hear vision , condition would significantly interfere collection study data Burn injury require regular anaesthesia surgery Use centrally act α2 agonist antagonist time randomisation , notably clonidine ( see section 5.7 prior concomitant treatment ) Known allergy study drug excipients study drug Patients expect treatment withdrawn withhold due poor prognosis Patients receive sedation therapeutic indication rather tolerate ventilator ( e.g . epilepsy ) Patients unlikely require continuous sedation mechanical ventilation ( e.g . GuillainBarré syndrome ) Patients unlikely weaned mechanical ventilation ; e.g . diseases/injuries primarily affect neuromuscular function respiratory apparatus clearly irreversible disease require prolonged ventilatory support ( e.g . high spinal cord injury advance amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) Distal paraplegia Positive pregnancy test currently lactate Received investigational drug within precede 30 day Concurrent participation interventional study ( study patient allocate different treatment group and/or nonroutine diagnostic monitoring procedure perform ) Previous participation study Any condition , investigator 's opinion , would make detrimental subject participate study</criteria>
