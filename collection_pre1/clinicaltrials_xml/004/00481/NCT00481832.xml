	<brief_summary>The purpose trial develop alternative treatment patient poor risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . This trial use combination high dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant use patient 's cell . This follow non-myeloablative transplant use stem cell relate unrelated donor try generate anti-lymphoma response new immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Followed Non-myeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , patient recurrent primary refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat second-line chemotherapy ( usually 2-3 course ) purpose cytoreduction establish sensitivity chemotherapy . Thereafter , peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilize cyclophosphamide granulocyte colony stimulate factor , apheresed cryopreserved . The standard high dose regimen consist augmented carmustine , etoposide cyclophosphamide . Unfortunately , subgroup patient poor outcome use autologous transplantation include transform lymphoma well patient attain minimal disease state due chemoresistant disease . Past study conduct Stanford include group 17 patient transformed lymphoma receive autologous transplant , median EFS OS 1.48 2.7 year respectively 7-year survival 20 % . In comparison , patient chemosensitive follicular lymphoma receive regimen also poor median EFS 1.3 year , median survival 6.7 year . The outcomes patient chemotherapy-resistant relapsed NHL also poor EFS range 20 % many study autologous transplantation . These group patient limited disease control survival standard chemotherapy regimen , although often excellent cytoreduction high-dose chemotherapy regimen , relapse remain primary cause treatment failure . The current trial utilizes similar approach take patient multiple myeloma , appear benefit allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect , use combine autologous non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen reduce transplant-related complication . Eligible patient treat high-dose chemotherapy use BCNU , etoposide cyclophosphamide autologous hematopoietic cell support method cytoreduction . Approximately 60-120 day autologous transplant , patient receive allogeneic transplant use preparative regimen total lymphoid irradiation anti-thymocyte globulin attempt develop graft-versus-lymphoma effect .</detailed_description>
