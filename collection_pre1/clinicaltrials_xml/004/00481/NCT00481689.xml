	<brief_summary>Researchers want find drug call Cipro® XR ( ciprofloxacin extended-release ) help people complicate urinary tract infection cause kind bacteria call Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The study doctor give Cipro XR people see safe work treat complicate urinary tract infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The study doctor also gather information use Cipro XR treat complicate urinary tract infection cause bacteria . About 500 people complicate urinary tract infection 18 year old old join study . Cipro XR approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment complicate urinary tract infection acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis ( inflammation kidney ) . The dose Cipro XR use study ( 1000 mg day 7 14 day ) , show safe effective . This study do gather information use dose Cipro XR complicate urinary tract infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa , well bacteria .</brief_summary>
