	<brief_summary>Patients Type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) suffer impaired postprandial hepatic glycogen storage breakdown , poor glycaemic control . Poor glycogen storage liver put patient risk fast hypoglycaemia . Amelioration glycaemic control could improve abnormality thereby reduce risk hypoglycaemia patient . The `` gold standard '' technique assessment hepatic glycogen metabolism human , 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 13C-MRS ) , expensive limited center worldwide . Furthermore , treat type 1 diabetic patient exhibit skeletal muscle insulin resistance treat insufficiently . This condition also reverse improvement glycaemic control . Recent study link skeletal muscle insulin resistance impair mitochondrial function . Up date , impact glycaemic control skeletal muscle mitochondrial function yet assess . Aim 1 project establish new assessment method glycogen metabolism . This new method base oral administration 2H2O acetaminophen . Our second aim examine impact improvement glycaemic control skeletal muscle mitochondrial function type 1 diabetic patient . Our third aim ass ATP-synthesis T1DM . We conduct prospective study 14 patient type 1 diabetes 14 healthy control . On respective study day , participant serve three standardized meal , blood sugar control hourly blood sample draw time interval determine glucoregulatory hormone , metabolites enrichment [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose . During night , four 13C-MRS-measurements perform combination [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose infusion ass glucose production , glycogen breakdown gluconeogenesis . In addition , patient drink 3g/kg bodyweight 2H2O acetaminophen administer . Thus new 2H2O-acetaminophen method apply simultaneously `` gold standard '' method . The following morning , mitochondrial function assess skeletal muscle unidirectional flux ATP synthase 31P MRS. TIDM patient study twice . First , condition insufficient glycaemic control second time three month intensified insulin treatment use CSII pump aim optimized metabolic control . Healthy control study . To assess muscular mitochondrial function T1DM measure ATP synthesis calf muscle magnetic resonance spectroscopy . First , conduct basal measurement . Thereafter , start hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic calmp stimulate ATP synthesis measure . This study provide information rate post absorptive glycogen breakdown , gluconeogenesis , postprandial glycogen storage liver skeletal muscle mitochondrial function condition optimize glycaemic control 3 month . Finally , study demonstrate whether poorly control type 1 diabetic patient exhibit abnormality muscle mitochondrial function extent alteration reverse optimized glycaemic control . We expect validate 2H2O-acetaminophen method , provide justification broad scale clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Assessment Liver Glycogen Kinetics ATP Synthesis Type1 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Invasive Assessment Liver Glycogen-Kinetics Type1 Diabetics Background : Hepatic glycogen principal short-term reserve circulate glucose human . Up 50-60 % endogenous glucose production derive hepatic glycogenolysis overnight fast . In healthy subject , deprivation hepatic glycogen prolong fasting ( 60-65 hour ) depress fast glucose production plasma glucose level approach hypoglycemic range . T1DM show low rate hepatic glycogen synthesis feed low rate glycogenolysis fast . Thus , dangerous condition may develop overnight fasting . Importantly , defective hepatic glycogen metabolism T1D therapeutically restore , suggest measurement glycogen kinetics could useful evaluate new exist therapy glycemic control . The accepted `` gold standard '' hepatic glycogenolysis measurement humans involves direct measurement natural abundance 13C hepatic glycogen signal use localize 13C NMR high-field clinical whole body magnetic resonance system . This method available handful clinical research center around world . Our propose measurement highly practical relatively inexpensive since involve oral administration small amount deuterated water ( 2H2O ) tracer standard dose Acetaminophen . This new method base analysis deuterium enrichment urinary glucuronide , derive glucose moiety hepatic UDP-glucose , immediate hexose precursor pool glycogen synthesis . To date , direct comparison 2H2O measurement clinical 13C MR method quantify rate fast glycogenolysis T1D subject . Mitochondrial dysfunction assess impaired myocellular ATP synthesis , associate insulin resistance relatives T2DM , patient overt T2DM T1DM poor glycemic control . However yet unknown extend alteration hyperglycemia contribute abnormality . Our hypothesis improvement hyperglycemia type 1 diabetic patient dot suffer genetically induce insulin resistance , increase myocellular ATP synthesis . Thus , study examine basal myocellular ATP synthetic flux patient type 1 diabetes mellitus improvement glycemic control . In addition , perform hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamp test stimulate mitochondrial ATP synthesis . Clinical Protocols : Simultaneous vivo 13C NMR 2H2O-glucuronide measurement hepatic glycogenolysis ( Vienna ) : A total 24 subject consist 12 healthy control 12 TID patient , first , insufficient metabolic control ( HbA1c 8.5-10.0 % ) 3 month intensified insulin treatment use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII pump ) aim optimize metabolic control ( HbA1c &lt; 7.5 % ) study follow informed consent MR Centre-of-Excellence , Medical University Vienna . All measurement either take place Hanusch Hospital ( Heinrich Collin Stra√üe 30 , A-1140 Vienna ) MR Center-of-Excellence General Hospital Vienna ( Lazerettgasse 14 , A-1090 Vienna ) . For 24 hour period study , T1D patient instruct omit NPH Zn-insulin use regular insulin control blood glucose concentration . On day 1 , star Hanusch Hospital , subject ingest 3 standard mixed meal ( 60 % CHO , 20 % protein 20 % fat ; 720kcal , 710kcal 800kcal ) 08:00 , 13:00 18.40 . The last meal serve transfer MR-Centre-of-Excellence first MR-measurement . Blood sugar control hourly blood sample draw time interval determine glucoregulatory hormone metabolite . Subjects transfer periodically magnetic resonance spectroscopy unit , vivo 13C NMR spectra last 1 hour perform 17.30-18.30 ( dinner ) , 23:30-0:30 , 02:00-03:00 06:50-07:50 . There perform additional 31P NMR measurement ass intramyocellular ATP synthesis right leg 05.30-06.30 . At 22:30 , 8-hour primed infusion [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose start . The prim dose 5 mg/kg adjust accord fast blood glucose level follow constant infusion 0.05 mg/kg/min . Plasma sample collect twice infusion start 0:30 -0:50 , 3:10 - 3:30 6:30-6:50 ten minute interval respectively , quantify enrichment plasma [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose . At 23.00 , subject ingest 2H2O 0.3 % body water 03:00 , ingest 1000 mg Acetaminophen ( Paracetamol ) . At 6:00 participant instruct void . This Urine collect Urine 1 . Between 06:00 08:00 , Urine collect recovery Acetaminophen glucuronide ( Urine2 ) point study finish . The urine evaporate , frozen send Coimbra analysis . After day one , intensified insulin treatment use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII pump ) start . Patients re-measured three month accord protocol . Healthy control examine . ATP-synthesis measure separate study day . Patients healthy control admit MR-Centre-of-Excellence 6:00 a.m. First , basal measurement ATP-synthesis . Thereafter , clamp start conduct 4 hour . Then , second 31P NMR measurement perform assess whether ATP synthesis stimulate T1DM patient . Participants release meal 15:00</detailed_description>
