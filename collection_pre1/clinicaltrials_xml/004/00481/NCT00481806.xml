	<detailed_description>The saphenous vein , run ankle groin along inside leg , commonly use graft people undergo CABG surgery . The vein remove leg reattached heart create detour around blocked part coronary artery . Following procedure , many people prescribe aspirin way increase chance graft procedure successful . However , saphenous vein graft failure may still occur people , indicate need understand happens might risk graft failure . Thrombin , protein involved blood clot process , somehow related aspirin resistance , abnormality blood flow , cell disruption within saphenous vein , factor think increase risk graft failure . The purpose study evaluate likelihood burst thrombin contribute graft failure people recently undergone CABG procedure use saphenous vein . This study enroll individual undergo CABG surgery University Maryland . Prior immediately follow surgery , incision make skin time require blood form clot determine . During surgery , participant ' blood vessel examine use image cell analysis technique . Blood collection occur surgery , immediately surgery , Days 1 , 3 , 30 follow surgery . A portion blood frozen future analysis . An x-ray saphenous vein perform Day 5 follow-up visit 6 12 month follow surgery . Kidney function measure visit prior x-ray procedure . At second visit , health mental status questionnaire complete .</detailed_description>
