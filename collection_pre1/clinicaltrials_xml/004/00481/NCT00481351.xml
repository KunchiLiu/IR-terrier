	<detailed_description>1-INTRODUCTION : 1.1.Chylomicron metabolism : Chylomicrons particle form postprandial period responsible transport blood lipid originate diet . These lipoprotein form mostly core triglyceride ( 90 % weight ) small amount vitamin cholesterol ester , surround phospholipid monolayer . Its protein portion , ie apolipoproteins ( apo ) remain adhered surface chylomicron exceed 2 % total weight , common Apo E , CII CIII , modulate activity lipolytic enzyme act ligand cell receptor . In circulation , chylomicron bind endothelial surface capillary triglyceride hydrolysis occur action lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , thereby release fatty acid glycerol surround cell , thus facilitate absorption accumulation various tissue , especially adipose muscle . The action lipase facilitate apo CII particle surface . This mechanism extremely important transit energy body After initial phase , chylomicron remnant , small deplete triglyceride , kidnap Disse space bind receptor via hepatic apolipoprotein E. Among investigator may mention LDL receptor ( receptor B / E ) receiver RLP ( receptor relate protein LDL ) . Importantly , apo B48 , main component chylomicron remnant apoprotéico , structural function . Chylomicrons VLDL share common catabolic pathway regard LPL least part mechanism cellular uptake . Within class lipoprotein , chylomicron rapid removal plasma , half life 15 minute healthy men . The speed ( kinetic ) removal chylomicron circulation correlate incidence severity atherosclerotic injury . Several study show low plasma clearance chylomicron patient coronary artery disease compare individual without atherosclerosis . These finding find even normolipemic subject . Chylomicrons participate atherosclerotic process generation foam cell direct deposition remain subendothelial space arterial wall , also interference reverse transport colestero . Thus treatment reduce plasma concentration chylomicron accelerate catabolism plasma could use prevent atherosclerosis . Among method use evaluate plasma kinetics chylomicron , investigator bring lipid emulsion similar chylomicron label radioisotope . They offer integrated vision clear step catabolism chylomicron plasma . Several study show kinetics chylomicron altered patient dyslipidemia / coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Defects found lipolysis removal chylomicron remnant , CAD patient process slowed5 . Other study also show altered kinetics chylomicron marker angiographic progression severe course CAD . Among lipid-lowering drug , statin potent safe drug reduce plasma level LDL , lead decrease LDL cholesterol 18-55 % . They inhibit hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase ( HMGCoA-A reductase ) , act synthesis cholesterol . The enzyme inhibition result decrease intracellular production cholesterol liver , lead increase expression LDL hepatic receptor , increase removal LDL circulation . The effect statins clinical event study several placebo control trial randomize 90,000 patient statin therapy placebo 3-5 year time . These study show consistently clinical benefit statin , include reduction cardiovascular morbidity mortality , overall mortality , coronary revascularization procedure , stroke , demonstrate recent meta-analysis . In group drug investigator find Simvastatin , drug low cost high efficacy reduce cardiovascular event demonstrate study 4S . Studies show increased expression LDL receptor liver cause statin lead increase hepatic uptake chylomicron artificial emulsion . In context , demonstrate previously increase plasma removal chylomicron remnant patient coronary disease treat pravastatin . Likewise , different dos atorvastatin ( 10mg 40mg ) evaluate relation intra-vascular metabolism plasma kinetics chylomicron emulsion subject dyslipidemia . It demonstrate atorvastatin significantly accelerate removal chylomicron slow characteristic patient , dose-dependent , reduce atherogenic potential triglyceride-rich particle circulation . Ezetimibe , new cholesterol absorption inhibitor , emerge tool control cholesterol . The drug act inhibit absorption dietary cholesterol bile brush border intestinal epithelium without affect absorption triglyceride vitamin . Moreover , glucuronidated ezetimibe undergoes enterohepatic recirculation , repeatedly return drug site action . Recent study suggest NPC1L1 ( Nieman-Pick C1 Like 1 protein ) critical role intestinal cholesterol absorption , establish direct target action ezetimibe18 . Results several study various model demonstrate lipid-lowering property ezetimibe monotherapy combination statin . In human , ezetimibe dose 10mg per day reduces level LDL 12-14 % . However , combine ezetimibe statins show therapeutic potential , association low dos latter present lower effect similar use maximal dos statin . Thus association low dos statin ezetimibe may alternative progressive titration statin therapy . This would due fact association reduce concentration intense intra-hepatic cholesterol , increase expression LDL receptor cell membrane hepatocytes . This fact lead high removal plasma lipoproteins bind receptor . Recently show isolated use ezetimibe increase plasma clearance lipoprotein contain apo B100 ( VLDL remnant LDL ) , without however affect removal contain apo B48 ( chylomicron remnant ) . To date , publish study evaluate association ezetimibe statin kinetics plasma chylomicron research do medline . 2.RATIONALE : In literature already several study show plasma removal chylomicron reduce subject coronary atherosclerosis change correlate great clinical angiographic progression disease . Therapy statins several different scheme prove effective increase kinetics chylomicron removal subject coronary artery disease , effect dose-dependent . This fact explain find inverse correlation plasma clearance chylomicron remnant plasma concentration LDL-cholesterol . However , date still clear effect ezetimibe , use alone combination statin , chylomicron . Another aspect evaluate comparison titration statin versus effect ezetimibe statins initial dos chylomicron , also previously evaluate 3.METHODS : The study include 30 patient previously diagnose stable chronic coronary ischemia clinical follow-up outpatient clinic Unit Chronic Coronary Disease , Heart Institute / INCOR-FMUSP . After initial suspension statin therapy 6 week ( washout ) , patient randomize three group : 12 patient ( group 1 ) treatment simvastatin 20mg/day , 13 patient ( group 2 ) therapy ezetimibe 10mg / day 5 patient use simvastatin 20 mg / day ( group 3 ) . In phase , patient treat drug choice 06 week assess chylomicron kinetics treatment . In second phase , patient receive lipid-lowering therapy optimization treatment simvastatin 80 mg / day ( group 1 ) simvastatin 20 mg / day ezetimibe 10 mg / day ( group 2 3 ) 6 week . Reassessment kinetics chylomicron held end second phase . Data analyze kinetics chylomicron baseline ( without lipid-lowering therapy minimum 6 week ) standard-dose monotherapy ( first phase ) optimize combination therapy statins maximum therapeutic dose combination statin ezetimibe ( second phase ) patient establish coronary disease . Biochemical analysis well evaluation kinetics chylomicron fund FAPESP No . 0408048-3 entitle `` Out free cholesterol lipoprotein particles deposition cholesterol arterial wall : new mechanism atherogenesis . The lipid-lowering drug supply Merck , Sharp &amp; Dohme ( simvastatin ezetimibe ) . Regarding suspension lipid-lowering drug patient stable coronary artery disease ( wash-out ) period six week , evidence increase risk acute coronary syndrome suspension statin 6 week 24 . The kinetics study chylomicron carry previously publish literature . The lipid emulsion preparation show follow percentage composition : Triolein 76.5 ± 4.1 % , free cholesterol 1.9 ± 0.3 % , cholesterol ester 11.2 ± 3.0 % phospholipid 10.4 ± 1 3 % size range 80 100 nm , make lipid mixture emulsify ultrasonic irradiation purify ultracentrifugation density gradient .
