	<detailed_description>The standard first-line treatment patient metastatic RCC IL-2 high dos , associate high frequency toxicity . IL-2 give low dos demonstrate similar result higher dose require study . RCC highly vascular express high level VEGF . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody direct Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) responsible angiogenesis . The study design evaluate response define time progression , safety toxicity patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Tissue correlation evaluate impact vascular VEGF clinical outcome retrospectively perform</detailed_description>
