	<brief_title>DHA ( Docosahexaenoic Acid ) , Omega 3 Fatty Acid , Slowing Progression Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary study show reduced risk Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) people consume increased amount fish diet . Many health benefit fish attribute abundance omega 3 fatty acid . Docosahexaenoic Acid ( DHA ) abundant omega 3 fatty acid brain . Data several animal model support hypothesis DHA may effective treatment AD mean anti-amyloid , antioxidant , neuroprotectant mechanism . In study , 400 individual mild moderate AD participate approximately 53 study site throughout US 18 month . Participants randomize 60 % receive approximately 2 gram DHA , divide 4 capsule , 2 capsule take twice day , 40 % receive identical placebo . Potential participant go study site screen visit , eligibility determine , accept , baseline visit cognitive status , behavioral status , functional status , global severity dementia assess . Vital sign biomarker lab also obtain . Subsequent visit occur every three month medication check , every 6 month , assessment , physical exam , lab . Some participant also take part MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) and/or CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ) sub-studies . For MRI sub-study , scan do prior begin study medication , 18 month . Likewise , CSF sub-study , lumbar puncture do prior begin study medication , 18 month . Enrollment restrict individual consume 200 mg DHA per day , almost 300 % average daily intake American diet . Individuals take fish oil omega 3 fatty acid supplement also eligible . Each visit include completion brief food frequency questionnaire monitor dietary DHA level .</detailed_description>
