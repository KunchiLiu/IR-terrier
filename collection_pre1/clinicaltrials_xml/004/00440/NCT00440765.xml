	<brief_title>VALEO : A Post Authorization Study , Designed Learn More About Safety Effectiveness Use Bortezomib Netherlands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bortezomib become commercially available European Union May 2004 third line treatment patient multiple myeloma . The registration base two phase II study research ongoing . Some experience already gain use product Netherlands mean compassionate use program initial registration . However , data available use bortezomib daily clinical practice limit . Therefore , need closely study use bortezomib daily clinical practice . During course study , registration bortezomib extend . In April 2005 , bortezomib register second line treatment multiple myeloma . Consequently , safety effectiveness data patient line treatment could collect project well ( arm A ) . Data large phase 3 trial show response rate differ patient treat multiple myeloma second line patient treat third line . Therefore protocol amend compare response rate two arm , dependent number previous treatment line multiple myeloma : The protocol also amend determine time progression response rate patient receive thalidomide early versus patient n't ( arm B ) . ARM A : Patients relapse multiple myeloma receive 1 previous line treatment show progression therapy ; ARM B : Patients relapse refractory multiple myeloma receive least 2 prior line treatment show progression recent therapy . This project 'post authorization study ( PAS ) ' . This mean routinely available medical data collect , patient ' permission , additional intervention diagnostic procedure do specifically study . Because study observational , dosage , administration duration treatment discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
