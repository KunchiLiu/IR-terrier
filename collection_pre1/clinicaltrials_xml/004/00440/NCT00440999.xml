	<brief_title>Pyronaridine Artesunate ( 3:1 ) Children Adults With Acute Plasmodium Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) consider today WHO best anti-malarials term efficacy low propensity resistance . Pyronaridine artesunate new ACT development treat acute uncomplicated malaria . Pyronaridine artesunate antimalarial agent history clinical use separately combination drug . Each drug powerful blood schizonticidal action . The aim fix dose combination pyronaridine artesunate treatment uncomplicated acute malaria provide rapid reduction parasitemia once-daily three-day regimen , thereby improve compliance reduce risk recrudescence slow elimination pyronaridine.Importantly , need new drug efficacious P. falciparum P. vivax , area specie exist health system undersourced , often possible distinguish two specie initial diagnosis .</detailed_description>
