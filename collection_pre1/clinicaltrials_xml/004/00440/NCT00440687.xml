	<brief_summary>Guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) patient moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Most COPD patient manage primary care receive ICS long-term irrespective severity . The effect withdraw ICS COPD patient primary care unknown.This randomise double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluate effect withdrawal inhale corticosteroid patient COPD recruit general practice . Participants clinical spirometric diagnosis COPD prescribe inhaled steroid 6 month entry trial . They randomise take fix dose steroid inhaler ( Flixotide Accuhaler ) identical placebo inhaler . Patients monitor use diary card year 3 monthly follow-up visit general practice . The primary outcome measure exacerbation frequency severity . Other outcomes time first exacerbation , cost , health status , lung function unscheduled care . We test hypothesis withdrawal ICS population would lead increased number exacerbation , early onset exacerbation , worsen symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine whether withdrawal inhaled corticosteroid patient COPD general practice effect : - frequency exacerbation compare control group - differences health status compare control group - difference lung function compare control group - change unscheduled care compare control group - Direct indirect cost compare control group Hypothesis The withdrawal inhale corticosteroid patient COPD identify primary care cause increase frequency severity exacerbation cost-effective .</detailed_description>
