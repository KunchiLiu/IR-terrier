	<detailed_description>A consequence chronic kidney disease anemia due decrease production erythropoietin . Anemia associate decreased oxygen delivery utilization , result fatigue , lethargy , decrease cognition mental acuity , cardiac complications.This study design compare 2 dose regimen , every-2-weeks every-4-weeks once-weekly dose regimen . Men woman diagnose anemia associate chronic kidney disease participate study . Approximately 400 patient include . This randomized ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , open-label , multicenter study epoetin alfa patient dialysis already maintain anemia epoetin alfa administer weekly . The study 40 42 week duration . All eligible patient treat epoetin alfa accord one follow 3 regimen : once-a-week injection ( Group 1 ) , every-2-weeks injection ( Group 2 ) , every-4-weeks injection ( Group 3 ) . The maximum volume per injection 1 mL , therefore patient may receive one injection per dose . The study treatment include period convert new dose regimen , subsequent stable maintenance treatment period . After initial dose , hemoglobin measure weekly basis use determine adjustment dose patient . The primary hypothesis average change hemoglobin level group receive epoetin alfa every 2 week every 4 week low change hemoglobin level group receive epoetin alfa week . Adverse event monitor throughout study . Clinical laboratory examination , vital sign , physical examination conduct routinely ensure patient safety . Approximately 1 mL epoetin alfa inject skin either week , every 2 week , every 4 week ( maximum dose 20,000 IU week , 40 , 000 IU every 2 week , 80,000 IU every 4 week , respectively ) 36 week treatment .</detailed_description>
