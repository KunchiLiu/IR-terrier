	<brief_title>Ketamine Versus Etomidate During Rapid Sequence Intubation : Consequences Hospital Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The national recommendation sedation concern intubation emergency setting advise use hypnotic , etomidate associate succinylcholine . A national inquiry show 80 % prehospital intubation use rapid sequence intubation sedation . However , several recent study throw question use etomidate indication . Indeed , etomidate powerful inhibitor synthesis cortisol . Adrenocortical hormone insufficiency clearly associated increase morbidity-mortality critically ill patient . Several author advise therefore use etomidate patient . Yet , date , indirect argument associate use etomidate excessive morbidity-mortality exist . A real causality link yet establish . Another hypnotic could constitute therapeutic alternative use etomidate exists : ketamine . The advantage molecule inhibit adrenocortical hormone axis . Objectives : To evaluate sedation use ketamine versus etomidate term morbidity-mortality critically ill patient intubated prehospital setting . Experimental diagram : A prospective , multicentric , randomize , control , simple blind trial independent analysis primary outcome . The expected benefit reduction morbidity patient admit intensive care unit receive ketamine intubation . The risk incur patient suitable research bound essentially adverse effect ketamine . These include psycho-dyslectic manifestation : nightmare , unpleasant awakening , disruption visual , auditory sensation mood , sensation float sometimes depersonalization . These adverse effect warn continuous administration benzodiazepine .</detailed_description>
