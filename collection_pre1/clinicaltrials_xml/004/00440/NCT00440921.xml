	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction - Until , mainly autologous plasma use produce fibrin sealant CS-1 . Within Sanquin question whether fibrin sealant produce allogeneic quarantaine plasma stock . Therefore study study whether allogenous single donor fibrin sealant produce use CS-1 effective wound heal consequence register product Sanquin . - The use fibrin sealant study prospective randomize trial patient undergo knee hip replacement . 2 . Aim · To study effectiveness fibrin sealant produce single donor allogeneic plasma use intra-operatively total knee hip replacement . - Primairy endpoint : wound healing . - Secondary endpoint : total blood loss 24h post-operative , amount blood transfuse , motion joint ( knee ) surgery , amount pain surgery , use antibiotic , wound infection , stay hospital , adverse event , satisfaction fibrin sealant use physician . 3 . Hypothesis - We hypothesize use fibrin sealant positive effect wound healing , cause less blood loss , decrease use antibiotic cause decreased number infection see compare patient treat fibrin sealant . Through , hospital stay probably shorten patient treat fibrin sealant . - As work hypothesis assume score wound heal least 20 % low least 20 % less blood loss fibrin sealant treat group . 4 . Definitions · N/A 5 . Ethical aspect 5.1 Admission Ethical Committee · For study approval ask ethical committee participate hospital . 5.2 Admission patient · Each patient potentially include ask informed consent admission participation study . 5.3 Confidentiality · Patients register use patient number , date birth study number anonimized . 5.4 Input Data · Input data do ( senior ) researcher O &amp; O SBNO . She/he take confidentiality data account . 6 . Materials collaborate department - Orthopedic Surgery department hospital - Patient data ( fill form appendix ) - Fibrin Sealant data ( filled form appendix ) - Department O &amp; O SBNO analysis data - SBNO production release fibrin sealant 7 . Patients 7.1 Inclusion - Age , minimum 18 year - Gender , man woman - Admission patient inform consent 7.2 Exclusion - Liver failure - Congenital acquire coagulation disorder - Thrombocytopenia , &lt; 100 x10^9PLT/L 7.3 Number patient - The number patient need study indicate statistical significantly difference calculate pilot study wound heal patient undergone knee- hip replacement . - Knee replacement : For calculation number patient aim see significant difference least 20 % good wound healing use fibrin sealant surgery . From pilot observe wound heal score 0.71±0.49 . With power 80 % alpha 0.05 need 193 evaluable patient study group ( fibrin sealant treat ) control group ( non fibrin sealant treat ) . - Hip replacement : For calculation number patient aim see significant difference least 20 % good wound healing use fibrin sealant surgery . From pilot observe wound heal score 1.58±0.79 . With power 80 % alpha 0.05 need 96 evaluable patient study group ( fibrin sealant treat ) control group ( non fibrin sealant treat ) . 8 . Adverse event - Each adverse event ( AE ) occur use fibrin sealant note form physician duty . - An AE untoward medical occurrence patient ( `` patient '' define subject enrol study evidence subject sign informed consent ) unfavorable unintended sign ( example , abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease occurs course clinical investigation . The AE may may consider related investigational drug device . All AE 's recorded patient 's chart grade mild , moderate , severe . All AE 's shall handle hospital procedure force soon possible pass study coordinator , case fatality least within 24h . - Mild : Symptom barely noticeable patient ; influence performance functioning . Prescription drug ordinarily need relief symptom may give personality patient . - Moderate : Symptom sufficient severity make patient uncomfortable ; performance daily activity influence ; patient able continue study ; treatment symptom need . - Severe : Symptom cause severe discomfort , may severity patient perform daily routine , may cause cessation treatment fibrin sealant ; even may fatal . - After complementary follow-up physician duty conclude notice argumentation whether AE : - cause fibrin sealant - possible , necessary cause fibrin sealant ( cause proven exclude ) - probably cause fibrin sealant - certainly cause fibrin sealant 9 . Procedure 9.1 Set clinical trial - The study randomize prospective clinical trial . - Fibrin sealant treat patient compare non fibrin sealant treat patient . - Patients include undergo total knee hip replacement . - During participation patient , study coordinator hospital staff operation room know whether patient treat fibrin sealant . - Nurses patient informed end participation patient ( discharge hospital ) . - Primairy endpoint wound heal . - Secondary endpoint total blood loss 24h post-operative , amount blood transfuse , motion joint ( knee ) surgery , amount pain surgery , use antibiotic , wound infection , stay hospital , adverse event , satisfaction fibrin sealant use physician . - Each group ( fibrin sealant treat non fibrin sealant treat ) wil contain 193 patient knee 96 patient hip surgery . 9.2 Production release fibrin sealant · Fibrin sealant produce release SBNO accord procedure force . 9.3 Controled treatment fibrin sealant - Each patient might include ( see 7.1 7.2 ) ask admission participate study inform consent prior surgery . Therefore letter information study give patient might include . - After admission envelope openend study coordinator hospital code treatment treatment fibrin sealant . The study coordinator tell outcome personel OR need know preparation usage fibrin sealant . People operation room communicate outcome nursery . Except treatment fibrin sealant difference treatment patient . - Patient nurse ( desire ) inform treatment fibrin sealant patient leave hospital discharge study . - Prior surgery blood sample patient take determine platelet count , hematocrit hemoglobin . - Fibrin sealant , use , assess closing wound . 9.4 Parameters - The following parameter patient surgery note pre-operative nurse ( double blind ) : - Birth date , gender - Weight , length - Platelet count , haemoglobin hematocrit - Underlying disease - Medication - Use antibiotic - Pain ( VASC ) via standardize score : Score 0 : pain ; 2 : pain neglect 4 : uncomfortable pain ; 6 : painful , neglect ; 8 : painful , patient concentrate him/herself ; 10 : extreme painful , patient anything . - The following parameter patient surgery note per-operative staff operation room ( single blind ) : - Time point start surgery , treatment fibrin sealant end surgery - Hemostasis fibrin sealant see ( yes ) , hip replacement , hard see knee replacement - Medication - Use antibiotic - Number transfusion ( red cell , platelet plasma ) - Adverse event ( severeness relation treatment fibrin sealant ) - Mobility knee ( knee replacement ) . - The following parameter patient surgery note 1h post-operative staff operation room ( single blind ) : - Blood loss via drain - Medication - Use antibiotic - Number transfusion ( red cell , platelet plasma ) - Adverse event ( severeness relation treatment fibrin sealant ) - Pain ( VASC ) &lt; 1h end anaesthesia via standardize score ( see parameter pre-operative ) . - The following parameter patient surgery note &gt; 1h post-operative nurse ( double blind ) : - Wound heal include wound leakage wound infection ( via score form , see appendix ) time wound treatment case heavy wound leakage ( i.e . bandage need change ) , 3 day postoperatively discharge hospital - Blood loss via drain remove drain , mostly next morning surgery - Medication discharge hospital - Use antibiotic discharge hospital - Number transfusion ( red cell , platelet plasma ) discharge hospital - Adverse event ( severeness relation treatment fibrin sealant ) discharge hospital - Pain ( VASC ) , 3h post operative , 21:00 h ( day surgery ) , 8:00 h , 14:00 h 21:00 h day surgery , 8:00 h second day surgery discharge hospital describe ( parameter pre-operative ) - Mobility knee discharge hospital . Also date 90° flexion reach note - Hospital stay surgery day 10 . Analyzing report result 10.1 Analyzing result - Anonimized patient data put analyzed Excel file . - Results knee hip replacement analyze report separately . - Via unpaired t-test difference primary secondary endpoint fibrin sealant treat non fibrin sealant treat patient study . - The Fisher 's exact test use determine effect use fibrin sealant wound leakage , wound infection undesired event . - Of result report write . Also report data separate hospital write . Results knee hip replacement describe separately . 11 . Time schedule - The study start January 2007 . After minimaal 193 evaluable patient per group knee surgery ( 193 patient treat fibrin sealant 193 patient treat fibrin sealant ) minimal 96 evaluable patient per group hip surgery ( 96 patient treat fibrin sealant 96 patient treat fibrin sealant ) study finish . - It expect study take 1 year , case 5 hospital participate . - Only case serious reason ( e.g . severe adverse event ) study terminate early .</detailed_description>
