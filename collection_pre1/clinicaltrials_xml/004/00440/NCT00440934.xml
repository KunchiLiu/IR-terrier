	<detailed_description>Hepatocarcinoma ( HCC ) first cause death due cancer worldwide . More one million two hundred thousand new patient diagnosed year . The prognosis patient suffer advanced hepatocarcinoma poor average survival less six month . Therapies hepatocarcinoma limit . Resection primary tumor therapeutic approach first choice possible . Although intervention result long-term survival patient , minority surgical candidate limitation due tumor size , patient 's overall condition presence hepatic cirrhosis . Phase I data suggest low level amplitude-modulated electromagnetic field administer intrabucally portable programmable device safe potentially effective treatment advance cancer . The device connect spoon-like coupler place patient 's mouth treatment . Patients advance HCC limit therapeutic option offer treatment combination HCC-specific frequency . The patient offer ambulatory treatment , administer three time day 60 min disease progression death .</detailed_description>
