	<brief_title>Velcade Myelodysplastic Syndrome - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) heterogeneous group clonal disorder hematopoietic stem cell characterize ineffective hematopoiesis lead peripheral cytopenia , variable risk progression advance disease and/or transformation acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The disease affect predominantly elderly individual ( median age 69 year ) ; overall incidence 4 per 100,000 individual rise &gt; 30 per 100,000 70 year age population . Therapy MDS include hematopoietic growth factor ( primis EPO , combination granulocyte-colony stimulating factor- G-CSF granulocyte-colony stimulate factor-GM-CSF ) , differentiate agent , immunotherapy , low dose chemotherapy strategy , AML-like induction regimen , traditional cytotoxic agent , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) strategy . With exception HSCT , result long-term survival 23 % 50 % patient ( Ref . 10 ) therapy MDS consistently show survival advantage , also modest result obtain attempt improve anemia and/or cytopenia , decrease number red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . Furthermore , MDS primarily disease old patient tolerate aggressive therapy therefore receive HSCT . No therapy thus consider standard MDS , supportive therapy , include RBC transfusion , platelet transfusion antibiotic therapy often focus care , especially old patient population . VELCADE™ ( bortezomib ) injection small molecule proteasome inhibitor develop Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( MPI ) novel agent treat human malignancy . VELCADE currently approve US FDA treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least 2 prior therapy demonstrate disease progression last therapy . VELCADE modify dipeptidyl boronic acid derive leucine phenylalanine ; chemical name N pyrazinecarbonyl L phenylalanine L leucine boronic acid molecular weight 384.25 dalton . Data non clinical clinical study conduct date support development Velcade treatment human malignancy .</detailed_description>
