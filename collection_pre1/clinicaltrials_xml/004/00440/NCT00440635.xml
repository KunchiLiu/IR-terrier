	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide bortezomib patient multiple myeloma receive least 2 previous line therapy refractory relapse last treatment . Additional objective study assess safety tolerability bortezomib follow level paraprotein patient receive bortezomib way followup disease burden</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Protocol ( EAP ) Provide Bortezomib Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received Least 2 Previous Lines Therapy Are Refractory Have Relapsed After Their Last Therapy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma uniformly fatal . Responses achieve multiple line therapy normally short duration . Therefore , patient multiple myeloma eventually relapse , become refractory therapy subsequently die cancer . The rationale study bortezomib novel agent may allow additional period response due different mechanism action . This open-label , single-arm , multicenter , non-comparative study provide expand access bortezomib patient multiple myeloma receive least two previous line therapy refractory relapse last treatment . Patients receive treatment bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 day 1 , 4 , 8 11 3-week cycle . No treatment administer last 10 day cycle . Treatment may repeat 8 cycle possible extension patient still respond end 8 cycle period . Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administer IV bolus</detailed_description>
