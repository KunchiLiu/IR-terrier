	<detailed_description>Background : In vitro study suggest low level amplitude-modulated electromagnetic field may modify cell growth . We identify specific frequency may block cancer cell growth . We develop portable programmable device deliver low level amplitude-modulated electromagnetic field . The device connect spoon-like coupler , place patient 's mouth treatment . Methods : We conduct feasibility study consist three daily treatment . All patient advance solid tumor measurable disease eligible , irrespective prior treatment . Patients assess laboratory exam ( complete blood count , comprehensive profile , tumor marker ) , image study every month first six month , every third month thereafter .</detailed_description>
