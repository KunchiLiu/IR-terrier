	<brief_summary>Individuals schizophrenia frequently impairment attention . These impairment show related overall functioning . Some research suggest Olanzapine may associate improvement various aspect attention . The primary purpose study determine whether switch typical antipsychotic Olanzapine improve task engagement . Individuals take typical antipsychotic randomly assign either 1 ) remain typical antipsychotic medication , 2 ) switch typical antipsychotic medication Olanzapine . All participant enrol twice-weekly 20 session cognitive training program specifically design target attention deficit promote active engagement . Improvements attention compare individual remain typical antipsychotic medication switch Olanzapine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Olanzapine ( OLZ ) emerge one promising pharmacologic intervention improve psychotic symptom may also target ability sustain attention cognitive test . Pupillary response , measure degree pupil constriction , visual scanning pattern unique method quantify attention gauge level psychophysiologic engagement visual task . It reasonable expect treatment attention problem effective , reflect efficient allocation psychophysiologic attentional resource measure pupillometry . Primary purpose pilot study demonstrate efficacy switch OLZ improve task engagement schizophrenia . Secondary objective demonstrate improve attention response OLZ translate improved attentional allocation strategy vocational readiness , demonstrate efficacy OLZ agent enhances ability benefit cognitive training . The propose study examine functional implication improve attention patient take OLZ , test hypothesis mechanism functional improvement process engagement measure pupillometry functional behavioral measure . Research Design Methodology : This industry-sponsored , investigator initiate trial 18 patient open-label design 24-month period . Participants adult outpatient ( age 18 55 ) diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder regimen `` typical '' antipsychotic . They randomly assign one two condition : 1 ) Olanzapine Group ( OLZ-G ) . Subjects assign OLZ condition switch OLZ previous medication OLZ antipsychotic medication part regimen . Following switch OLZ , subject enrolled twice weekly , 20-session cognitive training program specifically design target attention deficit promote active engagement . 2 ) `` Typicals '' Group ( TYP-G ) . Subjects assign `` typicals '' condition continue medication regimen throughout course study enrol cognitive training program . Research question : Compared participant combination `` typical '' medication , hypothesize person schizophrenia OLZ ( ) show significantly improve performance psychophysiologic measure task engagement , ( b ) show great engagement cognitive training , ( c ) show great improvement attention vocational task . Primary efficacy measure ASL H6 Series head-mounted optic pupillometer measure task engagement function pupil dilation visual scanning pattern . Secondary efficacy measure include computer software specifically develop assess on-task behavior computer exercise , brief neuropsychological test battery , global behavior symptom inventory , functional assessment treatment motivation .</detailed_description>
