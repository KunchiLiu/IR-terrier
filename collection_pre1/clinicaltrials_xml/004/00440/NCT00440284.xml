	<brief_summary>Objective . Flexible , intensive insulin therapy ( FIT ) pre-prandial regular insulin conventional insulin therapy ( CIT ) twice daily premixed insulin treatment option patient type 2 diabetes become insulin dependent . While intensive insulin therapy increase meal life style flexibility , conventional therapy easy perform . The aim study compare metabolic outcome patient preference treatment regimen . Research Design Methods . Non-blinded , randomize control cross-over clinical pilot trial . Insulin naive participant fail therapeutic goal oral antidiabetic therapy underwent FIT CIT two month . Patients complete standard Diabetes Treatment Teaching Programs ( DTTP ) train FIT CIT . Main outcome measure glycosylated hemoglobin ( GHb ) , mild severe hypoglycemia , insulin dosage , blood pressure body-mass-index ( BMI ) . Before/after inter-group analysis perform . Finally , therapy preference analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis In undertaken study test hypothesis flexible , intensive conventional insulin therapy insulin-naive adult type 2 diabetes equally effective regard metabolic outcomes . We hypothesize young participant employment would prefer flexible , intensive insulin therapy . Flexible , intensive conventional insulin therapy CIT consist twice daily injection premixed insulin ( 30 % regular insulin , 70 % NPH-insulin ) breakfast dinner . Participants follow individually adjust diet plan fix amount carbohydrate . Daily blood-glucose self-control perform insulin injection . Participants document blood glucose reading insulin dosage . Limited self-adjustment insulin dosage teach encourage DTTP , i.e . variance 4 IU insulin per injection . In FIT , participant measure blood glucose main meal bedtime adjust regular insulin dosage actual blood glucose level desire carbohydrate intake meal meal basis . When necessary , NPH insulin add bedtime . Additional administration oral antidiabetic drug permit . Study design , randomization intervention The trial design clinical , prospective , randomize , non-blinded , single center , cross-over pilot study . After randomization , participant start insulin therapy either FIT CIT complete Diabetes Treatment Teaching Program out-patient basis . In four week run-in period weekly visit , individual insulin dosage carbohydrate intake determine ( figure 1 ) . The run-in follow 8 week study sequence cross-over . At cross-over , participant give one structured teach session refresh switch CIT FIT ( Group A ) FIT CIT ( Group B ) , respectively . After one week run-in period insulin dose-adjustment , participant complete second 8 week study sequence . Regular visit hold begin end study sequence . Additional visit hold 2 week , adjust therapy necessary . During visit , study team consist diabetologist specially trained nurse educator analyze personal diabetes record give advice regard insulin dose adjustment problem related current diabetes therapy . At end trial , participant decide therapy continue . Setting , eligibility criterion outcome measure Participants recruit outpatient clinic Unit Endocrinology Metabolic Diseases Department Internal Medicine Friedrich-Schiller-University , Jena . All patient type 2 diabetes fail achieve therapeutic goal oral antidiabetic therapy refer local General Practitioners outpatient clinic initiation insulin therapy candidate inclusion study . Participants agree participate study recruit consecutive order refer out-patient clinic . They admit study follow criterion present : ( 1 ) type 2 diabetes , ( 2 ) diabetes duration &lt; 2 year , ( 3 ) insulin naive , ( 4 ) ineffective oral antidiabetic therapy &lt; 3 month , ( 5 ) GHb 7 11 % , ( 6 ) age 40 65 year , ( 7 ) co-medication corticosteroid , ( 8 ) pregnancy , severe mental somatic disease ( 9 ) unwillingness return follow-up . The primary end-point respect effectiveness FIT CIT glycosylated ( GHb ) . Secondary end-points mild severe symptom hypoglycemia , insulin dosage , blood pressure , BMI individual therapy preference . Sample size To 90 % chance detect significant ( two side 5 % level ) 0.5 % difference two group GHb , assume standard deviation 0.8 % , 38 participant require .</detailed_description>
