	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Epoetin Alfa Initiation Maintenance Treatment Patients With Anemia Associated With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , multicenter study design show 2 alternative dosing regimen , weekly every-2-weeks ( give dose equivalent 50 IU/kg 3 time week ) inferior 3-times-weekly dose regimen . Approximately 375 patient anemia enrol study . Patients randomly assign receive epoetin alfa subcutaneous ( SC ) injection accord one follow 3 regimen : 3 time weekly ( Group 1 ) , weekly ( Group 2 ) , every 2 week ( Group 3 ) 22 week . Thereafter , patient Group 1 switch once-weekly dose regimen additional 22 week , patient Groups 2 3 continue current treatment additional 22 week . The total duration open-label treatment phase 44 week include initiation maintenance treatment period ( goal increase , maintain , hemoglobin level 11.0 11.9 g/dL inclusive ) safety period ( assess long exposure epoetin alfa treatment period hemoglobin instability transition 3-times-weekly once-weekly dosing ) . Starting dos epoetin alfa 3-times-weekly , once-weekly , every-2-weeks group 50 IU/kg , 10,000 IU , 20,000 IU , respectively ; thereafter adjust accord weekly hemoglobin concentration . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign .</detailed_description>
