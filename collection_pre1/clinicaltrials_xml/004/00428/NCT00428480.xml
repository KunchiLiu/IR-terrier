	<brief_title>Walking Study Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-blind , randomize , multi-center trial design . People admit post-stroke inpatient rehabilitation examine eligibility treat physician . Subjects satisfy selection criterion agree participate randomize either experimental group control group . Intervention All subject receive usual therapy inpatient rehabilitation stay . Subjects experimental group ( Daily Reinforcement Speed DRS group ) receive encouragement walk faster feedback performance every day duration inpatient stay . During one daily therapy session ( preferably morning ) , experimental subject encourage physical therapist walk least 10 ( 25 foot ) along straight hallway . Subjects experimental group time stopwatch treat physical therapist day 10-meter walking task . If subject able walk 10 meter , short distance use 10-meter distance achieve ( possible ) . Before start timed walk , therapist remind subject `` walk fast safely possible '' try walk distance `` second faster able past day '' . The therapist provide assistance another person use aid , whatever need safety . The timed test stop perform one day best patient care . The subject 's safety must compromise . At end time walk , therapist provide result day positive tone , `` Very good ! You walk xx second '' . Then , ( ) 'This well x second ' , ( b ) 'This show hold ' , ( c ) ' I believe soon able walk bit faster well walk pattern ' . '' Subjects randomize control group ( No Reinforcement Speed NRS group ) time daily 10-meter walk , specifically encourage walk faster day . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure walk speed , measure stopwatch 15.2 ( 50 foot ) .3 A blinded evaluator ( i.e . physical therapist train person involve subject 's treatment work inpatient unit ) conduct assessment . The treat physical therapist assist subject gait speed assessment necessary . The subject employ usual assistive device stage recovery . The gait speed assessment conduct flat tiled surface along walkway within sight patient . A chair place either end 15 straight walkway . The subject start approximately 3 step behind start line allow acceleration . The blinded assessor instructs subject `` walk fast safely I tell stop . If sit rest , tell . '' When subject 's lead toe cross line , timing begin . When lead toe cross 15.2-meter ( finish ) line , time stop . The subject tell stop walk foot cross line . This ensure subject decelerate traverse full 15.2 meter . Data record time second . At entry study , anticipated subject may able walk continuously 15 meter . In case , time 5-meter walk substitute study entry designate data entry form , still necessary , discharge . If subject study entry walk 5 meter without stop rest need maximal assistance , test mark `` unable '' data record sheet . Gait speed measurement collect blind evaluator study entry ( possible ) , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week entry still inpatient , within one day inpatient discharge , , possible , 3 month 6 month study entry . The Functional Ambulation Classification Index complete blind evaluator gait speed assessment . Thus , FAC score record time point gait speed evaluation . The secondary outcome measure distance walk 3 minute . The subject instruct blind assessor walk many lap walkway possible 3 minute . A straight 25-meter walkway use . The patient turn end continue walk 3 minute . The distance cover 3 minute measure meter . The subject may halt rest time continue walk ready . If subject must sit rest , test discontinue time distance record . The 3-minute walking test conduct 4 time point : 4 week entry still inpatient , within 2 day inpatient discharge , 3 month post study entry , 6 month post study entry . If evaluator believe test accurate reflection walk distance ( interruption occur subject stop distract ) , test repeat best distance record . The blinded observer find isolated convenient place perform test . Before trial begin , observer practice time walk speed distance test 3 hemiparetic inpatient therapists 4 repeated test within 1-2 day try obtain reproducible data . The walking speed distance differ 10 % . Descriptive data assessment Each subject data record site randomization number , name , birth date identify characteristic . In addition result gait speed walk distance assessment ( collect enter blinded evaluator ) , basic descriptive information subject also collect order adequately characterize study population . This information obtain study physician designate person medical record interview subject family . The following information collect subject : age , gender , handedness ; date stroke onset , admission rehabilitation , entry trial , discharge patient care ; ( select list ) type stroke , general location stroke , side hemiparesis . Severity stroke time entry study characterize use National Institutes Health Stroke Scale,4-5 modify Rankin Scale , Functional Ambulation Classification Index , well accepted measure . The investigator also ask subject record number fall discharge 3 month 3 month 6 month entry use calendar bring follow-up . Data entry All data entry via web-based system . The blinded observer enter walking-related data give password access data entry site differs password access study physician . Data analysis For anticipated effect size 0.4 , conservative estimate use two-tailed alpha 0.01 power 0.9 , need sample size 150 subject group . An ideal sample size varied population primary secondary outcome 250 subject arm allow dropouts gather enough subject also test 3 6 month study entry . This would make trial large prospective neurorehabilitation study ever attempt .</detailed_description>
