	<brief_summary>This study randomize patient advanced pancreatic islet cell tumor receive either sunitinib placebo . Patients randomize sunitinib receive 37.5 mg sunitinib daily , randomize placebo receive tablet look similar active drug . Neither patient doctor know whether patient receive sunitinib placebo . Patients follow determine status size tumor , survival , quality life safety drug . The study design detect 50 % improvement median PFS [ Progression Free Survival ] 90 % power enroll 340 subject . An interim analysis plan 130 event occur , final analysis conduct 260 event occur . Study A6181111 stop early enrollment period clear clinically meaningful improvement efficacy sunitinib treatment arm recommend DMC [ Data Monitoring Committee ] . The actual number subject enrol 171 actual number PFS event record 81 PFS event . The decision terminate study base safety concern relate sunitinib administration .</brief_summary>
