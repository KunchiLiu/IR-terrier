	<brief_title>Endothelial Function IMT Survivors Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease free survival Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) patient improve dramatically past decade . With dramatic advance patient 's survival , prevention treatment long-term adverse effect chemotherapy radiotherapy become major focus interest . HD survivor excess mortality compare age-matched general population , even exclude disease relapse . A considerable proportion excess mortality due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , principally ischemic heart disease stroke . The propose study assess endothelial function HD survivor , use non-invasive technique brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , high-resolution ultrasonography . We also assess IMT . The result test independent predictor atherosclerosis disease progression cardiovascular event rate . This prospective study comprise 40 young-adult ( age 18-30 year ) . The study comprise 40 survivor HD : 20 patient treated chemotherapy radiotherapy chest 20 patient treated chemotherapy alone . The patient compare age sex-matched patient data base endothelial function laboratory heart institute Sheba Medical Center . In addition brachial artery endothelial function assessment , patient also undergo physical examination include anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , waist hip circumference ) , blood pressure . The evaluation also include blood test glucose , lipid profile , CRP , AST , ALT insulin . A medical history include smoke history family history CVD dyslipidemia obtain . Patients treat radiotherapy chest compare patient treat chemotherapy alone patient compare healthy control . The patient characterize age , risk factor coronary heart disease endothelial function assess brachial artery FMD . We establish rate endothelial function abnormality survivor HD correlation risk factor .</detailed_description>
