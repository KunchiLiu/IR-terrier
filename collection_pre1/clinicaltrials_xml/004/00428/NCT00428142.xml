	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together combination chemotherapy rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give bortezomib together combination chemotherapy rituximab work give first-line therapy treat patient stage III stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib , Combination Chemotherapy , Rituximab First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess efficacy systemic first-line treatment comprise bortezomib , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone , rituximab , term complete response rate , patient stage III IV follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Assess incidence severe neurotoxicity ( define grade 3 4 neuropathy neuropathic pain first 4 course treatment ) patient treat regimen . Secondary - Assess overall response rate response duration patient treat regimen . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Evaluate tolerability characterize toxicity profile regimen patient . - Assess quality life , particular focus neurotoxicity-related change , patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized , open-label study . Patient receive cyclophosphamide IV 15-45 minute , vincristine IV 3-5 second rituximab IV 1½-6 hour day 1 , oral prednisone daily day 1-5 , bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , end course treatment , day 42 post treatment visit . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 week every 3-6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 90 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
