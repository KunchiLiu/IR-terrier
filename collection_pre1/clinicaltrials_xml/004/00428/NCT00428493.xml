	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study individual expose confirm case Human Influenza A ( H5N1 ) infection China . The study conduct period approximately one year . Adults child , great age 1 , meet eligibility criterion consent enrolled study . These subject undergo two blood draw serologic test presence H5N1 antibodies accord algorithm . These subject also administer structured questionnaire collection demographic information , information potential exposure poultry , bird animal , infected human clinical symptom . This questionnaire similar data element questionnaire use past collection China CDC . The questionnaire administer area China poultry human case , well , high risk population non-outbreak area . Enrolled participant complete two study visit one month apart third visit test positive influenza A H5N1 infection . Participants consent HIV test fourth visit obtain HIV test result . The primary study objective determine prevalence antibody avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus among close contact health care worker associate confirmed H5N1 infected individual China . The secondary study objective : describe risk factor human infection avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus China ; evaluate incidence seroconversion increase titer H5N1 antibody ; describe risk factor associate seroconversion increase titer H5N1 antibody ; determine T-cell immune response H5N1 infected individual ; determine prevalence co-infection H5N1 HIV-1 . The primary endpoint detection avian influenza H5N1 infection determine positive result Hemagglutination Inhibition ( HI ) confirm Microneutralization ( MN ) . Corresponding secondary study objective , follow assess secondary study endpoint : association risk factor avian influenza seropositivity , include demographic characteristic various exposure poultry , bird , infected human ; H5N1 serum antibody titer seroconversion great equal 4-fold increase titer ; association risk factor avian influenza seroconversion , include demographic characteristic various exposure poultry , bird , infected human ; HIV-1 infection determine ELISA Western Blot assay co-infection H5N1 HIV-1 determine assay describe ; T-cell response H5N1 determine ELISPOT assay ICS .</detailed_description>
