	<brief_title>Long-Term IOP Fluctuation VF Progression After Triple Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study report lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) slow advancement visual field damage glaucoma patient . However , even IOP substantially lower , reduction mean peak IOP always prevent visual field progression.We believe long-term IOP fluctuation may play significant role visual field deterioration patient .</detailed_description>
