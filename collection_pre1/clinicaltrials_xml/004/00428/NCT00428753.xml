	<detailed_description>This study match case-control study risk factor human infection avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus China . The primary study objective determine risk factor avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus infection human , China , whether subject symptomatic . The confirmed case-patients confirm antibody positive avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) person ( asymptomatic sub-clinical ) identify previously do National Surveillance Program include study case . Controls identified population registry villages rural case adjacent apartment building urban case ' residence . If National Surveillance Program identifies healthcare worker infected avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus , healthcare worker department healthcare facility case work also include control . A matched case-control study conduct ratio 4 control per 1 case . Cases control meet eligibility criterion consent enrolled study .

Survived case , individual whose specimen H5N1 test positive previous National Surveillance Program control ask provide blood sample determine whether antibody H5N1 . New confirm case control ask donate blood sample H5N1 antibody test . Any control test positive become case additional control identify . All sample test H5N1 antibody hemagglutination inhibition ( use horse red blood cell ) microneutralization assay . If negative , individual consider sero-negative ; positive , individual consider sero-positive purpose study ; result hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) microneutralization ( MN ) assay discordant , MN result consider final result ( negative positive ) . Appropriate antigen assays select base antigenic characteristic virus circulate region time sample collection . HI MN assay perform accord accepted SOPs . The study complete within one year .</detailed_description>
