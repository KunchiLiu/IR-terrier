	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) evaluate safety trastuzumab , bevacizumab docetaxel regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , Bevacizumab , Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) Trial Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Antibodies protein normally part immune system bind foreign agent body . Researchers manufacture antibody outside human body bind specific target proteins cancer cell . Herceptin monoclonal antibody bind human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER-2 ) , kill HER2-positive cancer cell . Herceptin use treat breast cancer HER2-positive , spread treatment drug . Bevacizumab signal transduction inhibitor work prevent growth new blood vessel surround tissue tumor . Bevacizumab specifically inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , substance make cell stimulate new blood vessel formation . Research indicate HER-2 signal help induce VEGF expression . Therefore , cancer treatment target HER-2 VEGF may improve anti-cancer efficacy patient . Docetaxel chemotherapy agent use breast type cancer . The current study build previous research suggest safety potential efficacy combination trastuzumab , bevacizumab , docetaxel . Purpose : The primary objective determine progression free survival evaluate safety trastuzumab , bevacizumab , docetaxel . Secondary objective assess early change circulate tumor cell circulate endothelial cell predictor progression free survival clinical benefit , well determine overall clinical benefit rate . Treatment : Study participant give trastuzumab , bevacizumab , docetaxel . All study drug give intravenous infusion every 21 day . A cycle consider 3 week . A minimum 6 study treatment cycle require unless study participant experience disease growth intolerable toxicity . The decision stop docetaxel 6 cycle discretion treat physician patient . Study participant derive benefit study drug may continue trastuzumab bevacizumab alone . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor study participant .</detailed_description>
