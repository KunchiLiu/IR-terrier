	<brief_summary>This sixteen-week , randomize , double-blind add-on study valacyclovir versus placebo approximately 60 outpatient meet diagnostic criterion DSM-IV Bipolar I II disorder , test positive HSV-1 demonstrable cognitive impairment define total score le 85 ( one standard deviation normal range ) Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) . Each patient randomize double-blind treatment either valacyclovir placebo sixteen week . All subject maintain stable regimen psychiatric drug prescribe treat psychiatrist . Patients evaluate every 2 week treatment team mood rating scale administer visit include YMRS , PANSS MADRS . The RBANS administer 8 16 week . Both treatment team patient remain blind course study . Following active treatment phase , patient receive treatment clinically indicate . Primary Hypothesis : Valacyclovir superior placebo reduce cognitive symptom associate bipolar disorder subject previously infect Herpes Simplex virus I ( HSV-1 ) . Secondary Hypothesis : Valacyclovir superior placebo reduce mood symptom associate bipolar disorder subject previously infect HSV-1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Herpes Viral Infections Mental Illness . Recent study suggest chronic , recurrent infection herpes family virus may play role chronic mental illness schizophrenia bipolar disorder . Several study indicate individual schizophrenia evidence increase exposure Herpes virus ( Buka et al , 2001 ; Srikanth et al , 1994 ; Pelonero et al , 1990 ; Bartova et al , 1987 ) though find study ( Fux et al , 1992 ; DeLisi et al , 1986 ; King et al , 1985 ) . Leweke et al ( 2004 ) find untreated individual recent first episode schizophrenia increase level serum CSF IgG antibodies CMV Toxoplasma gondii comparison control without psychiatric illness . Notably , serum IgM level increase indicate infection occur recently . Treated individual schizophrenia similar antibody level control . Finally , Dickerson et al recently show previous HSV-1 infection associate cognitive impairment bipolar disorder , relative risk 22.2 risk increase presence COMT158 Val/Val genotype ( Dickerson et al , 2006 ) . It well know active replication herpes virus may occur extend period latency . It also show active replication virus central nervous system may trigger environmental psychosocial stressor cause mood even psychotic symptom ( Koehler Guth 1979 ; Schlitt et al . 1985 ; Fisher , 1996 ) . Taken together evidence increase exposure Herpes viruses find individual schizophrenia bipolar disorder , one hypotheses remain tested episodic reactivation HSV-1 brain trigger environmental stressor could pathogenic mechanism contribute symptomatology subset bipolar disorder schizophrenic patient . Cognitive Impairment Bipolar Disorder Cognitive , neuropsychological , function one major domain symptomatology major mental illness . While cognitive impairment schizophrenia long establish , neuropsychological functioning bipolar disorder less extensively study . Nevertheless , evidence patient mood disorder frequently manifest cognitive deficit attention , executive memory function ( Hoff et al . 1990 ; Goldberg et al . 1993 ; Seidman et al . 2002 ) . While symptomatic bipolar disorder patient show widespread cognitive abnormality , evidence many study also support hypothesis persistent residual cognitive impairment patient euthymic phase illness ( van Gorp et al . 1998 ; Thompson et al . 2005 ) . As noted , Dickerson et al recently show association HSV-1 seropositivity cognitive dysfunction bipolar disorder ( 2006 ) . Valacyclovir Schizophrenia Recent study show herpes virus may play etiologic role cognitive impairment occur subset patient schizophrenia bipolar disorder . Dickerson et al . ( 2003a ) find serum antibody HSV1 independent predictor cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . Similarly , Dickerson et al . ( 2004 ) find serological evidence infection HSV1 also predictive cognitive impairment bipolar disorder . This association independent factor could affect cognition include manic , depressive psychotic symptom , age onset , education , medication . A clinical trial use antiviral medication valacyclovir schizophrenia recently conduct ( Dickerson et al . 2003b ) . This study find significant improvement psychiatric symptom individual schizophrenia seropositive cytomegalovirus , another virus herpes family . This first evidence antiviral medication may helpful psychiatric condition . The study divide two phase Screening Phase . Subjects initially screen telephone , meet major inclusion exclusion criterion , invite in-person screening . After consent process , subject first go RBANS testing . If meet criterion cognitive impairment ( total score &lt; 85 ) subject go one rapid HSV1 test administer ( result available 1-7 day Hopkins ) undergo Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) conduct research assistant . Subjects test positive HSV-1 diagnosis Bipolar I Bipolar II disorder SCID invite back meet team psychiatrist complete screening , include psychiatric interview examination , medical history physical examination , vital sign , baseline laboratory test include complete blood count blood chemistry well evaluation treatment team feel medically indicate . Subjects appropriate study invite join Active Phase study . Active Phase A second consenting process conduct entrance active phase trial . Subjects enter phase within 14 day RBANS test screen visit . During phase patient randomly assign receive either valacyclovir placebo addition standard psychiatric medication . The patient receive capsule contain valacyclovir placebo blind course study . Valacyclovir start initial dose 1000mg twice daily . At baseline visit , mood rating scale include YMRS , MADRS , PANSS administer . Please see Study Schematic ( end Form A ) scale , history form , questionnaire administer screen throughout study . Subjects meet treatment team every 2 week rating scale measurement assessment side effect . At end 8 16 week , subject undergo RBANS testing . Both subject raters remain blind trial</detailed_description>
