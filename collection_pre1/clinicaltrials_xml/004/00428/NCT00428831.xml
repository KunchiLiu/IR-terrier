	<brief_summary>The main purpose study look relationship type flu virus characteristic infected patient , include vaccination status , organ system involvement , disease severity . In study , 500 patient respiratory illness nose/throat fluid sample collect . At Children 's Hospital Boston , patient 30 day 5 year age recruit ; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , patient age eligible . The researcher compare symptom infection similar flu virus type look difference flu virus type 2 age group patient . The researcher also look whether flu virus type first show child prior infect adult . Hopefully study improve understand flu virus develop , spread , cause disease . This information may help development effective flu vaccine , prevention measure , treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There evidence pediatric population , particular , may play essential role influenza transmission . One recent study show child age 3 4 year consistently first population group affect influenza illness several winter season . In addition , influenza illness child le 5 year age strong predictor mortality among adult . Collecting sample adults well child pre-school age group would enable researcher examine specific role population play evolution influenza virus lineages development dominant strain . In prospective observational study , researcher therefore propose collect sample pediatric patient Children 's Hospital adult Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . This enable researcher compare clinical manifestation result infection similar strain examine difference genomic sequence viruses two population group . The primary objective study conduct pilot study explore correlation influenza viral strain clinical characteristic infected patient , include vaccination status , organ system involvement , disease severity . With regard outcome measure , researcher determine rate clinical feature associate specific viral strain . The clinical characteristic researcher examine vaccination status , illness symptom ( presence fever , cough , runny nose/ stuffy nose , headache , myalgia , fatigue ) , initial O2 saturation , treatment antibiotic antiviral , hospitalization , daycare kindergarten attendance , exposure elderly person , length illness . The secondary study objective conduct pilot study compare influenza genomic sequence clinical data pediatric adult patient infect influenza explore potential viral transmission pattern two population . With regard outcome measure , researcher determine rate clinical feature specific viral strain pediatric adult population . The clinical characteristic researcher examine primary objective . The researcher also identify temporal pattern infection cause specific viral strain two group . Specifically , researcher examine whether viral strain first emerge pediatric population prior infect adult group . A total 500 patient respiratory illness recruit Children 's Hospital Boston Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . At Children 's Hospital , patient 30 day 5 year age recruit ; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center patient age eligible . The researcher recruit patient gender health status . Respiratory sample clinical information collect participant . It hop study help researcher ' understand influenza virus evolve , spread , cause disease . In future , may help development effective vaccine prevention measure , well treatment people infected influenza .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . For pediatric population : Age patient : 30 day 5 year ; adult population : age 2 . Illness onset within past 5 day 3 . Symptoms fever ( &gt; =38Â° ) plus one following : cough , runny nose , congestion , sneeze ( twice within one day ) . These symptom must present time presentation emergency department ( ED ) admission hospital . 4 . Patient parent/guardian able give inform consent 1 . Pediatric patient nonverbal adult accompany caregiver 2 . Participant/caregiver reach phone 710 day 3 . Patient condition compromise respiratory function handle respiratory secretion ( e.g. , severe cognitive dysfunction , spinal cord injury , neuromuscular disorder )</criteria>
