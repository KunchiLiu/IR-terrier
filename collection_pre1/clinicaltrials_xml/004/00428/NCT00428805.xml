	<detailed_description>The purpose study design , implement , evaluate culturally appropriate , multi-level trans-community obesity prevention Head Start staff , child , family rural American Indian Hispanic communities New Mexico . The intervention , Child Health Initiative Lifelong Eating Exercise ( CHILE ) include policy change address environmental determinant healthful eating physical activity behavior , well individual interpersonal level strategy influence behavioral determinant . CHILE promote increase moderate vigorous physical activity ; increase consumption fruit , vegetable , whole grain ; decrease consumption sweeten beverage high-fat food ; decrease television view screen time . This study employ nest design 16 Head Start program randomly assign intervention ( n=8 ) control condition ( n=8 ) . Two cohort 3-year-old child within Head Start center follow two year post randomization . Participants assess use measurement interview protocol total four time : pre-intervention , twice intervention , two year post intervention . One midpoint time point collect height weight measurement . This longitudinal component design allow in-depth understanding process work intervention exploration hypothesize mediating effect , well potential moderator , individual characteristic participant may influence intervention exposure efficacy . In order efficiently address goal , study divide three phase . Phase I take place first 16 month study . During time focus identification recruitment Head Start center , formative assessment Head Start center , randomization Head Start center intervention control condition , obtain institutional review board approval , intervention planning intervention Head Start center community , preparation pilot test measurement protocol . Sixteen rural Head Start center predominately American Indian ( 6 center ) Hispanic ( 10 center ) community NM recruit assistance community partner site visit , phone call , letter . In order participate study , Head Start Director sign memorandum agreement ( MOA ) , understand may randomize intervention control condition . The MOA outline responsibility research team participate site list benefit participation . Eligibility criterion Head Start center : ) student predominantly American Indian Hispanic ; b ) minimum 20 3-year old enrol year ; c ) center retain least 80 % student two year . Head Start child family recruit CHILE upon enrollment participate Head Start center . For Head Start child eligible study , must enrol one participate Head Start center , 3 year old baseline , active consent form complete parent legal guardian . The primary caregiver participate Head Start student also participate study . In addition , Head Start teacher , aide , food service workers/cooks affiliate 16 Head Start center involve study , participation intervention train implementation , periodic interview and/or focus group , completion write log . In intervention Head Start community , grocery store manager owner , well Head Start teacher , aide , food service workers/cooks , involve intervention . Formative assessment take place first six month study ensure intervention meet need , context , daily reality work Head Start center community rural New Mexico . Similar principle set UNM PRC community-based participatory research effort , consistent aim study , formative assessment examine Head Start barrier resource , identify Head Start staff opportunity integrate physical activity nutrition curriculum , food service , general Head Start environment . The information gather period use adapt and/or design developmentally-appropriate , organizationally-feasible physical activity nutrition intervention school . Priority give intervention component proven feasible study . After develop sign MOA intervention control Head Start center outline research study aim role responsibility , study staff use modify version Environmental Checklist develop Pathways identify potential environmental focus change . Observations Head Start student recess , school , lunch , `` open '' time conduct member research team Head Start center gain information level intensity physical activity school day , well identify location use physical activity . Finally , formative assessment phase , height weight data collect current Head Start student ( study participant ) , Head Start center group median BMI percentile value randomization . Following formative assessment , Head Start center randomly assign intervention control condition . To ensure baseline average BMI percentile similar control intervention group , Head Start center assign stratified randomization process . We expect 10 predominantly Hispanic Head Starts 6 predominantly American Indian Head Starts . Pre-intervention baseline measurement make Head Start center use stratify Head Start center ethnic subpopulation lower upper BMI percentile stratum . Random allocation use assign intervention status stratum define BMI ethnicity . Once intervention Head Start center determine , intervention planning conduct center . The interventionists coordinate effort integrate Head Start staff , community leader , health provider , grocery store manager owner strategic plan process intervention . The purpose phase establish collaborative relationship study participant ensure intervention material curriculum reflect cultural context community . While study team collectively conduct research many propose community , essential establish participatory framework sustain throughout duration study beyond . Strategies include : hands-on food preparation taste-testing fruit , vegetable , whole grain food ; story telling , poem , song , game , craft , and/or puppet reinforce familiar introduce new fruit , vegetable whole grain food . Materials send home student intervention activity reinforce family . Head Start staff play critical role intervention . They receive in-service training quarterly basis design prepare support implement classroom curriculum . We anticipate frequent training short period time Pathways teacher train keep intervention fresh content manageable . Topics include importance obesity prevention , role fruit , vegetable , whole grain maintain weight prevent obesity , role physical activity maintain weight prevent obesity , developmentally appropriate physical activity , strategy limit television view screen time . Much training hands-on experiential learning , like many activity conduct classroom . We also work Head Start program staff determine feasibility training session contribute credentialing process Head Start teachers staff . We plan use training program Head Start cook intervention school similar successful school food service training program use Pathways intervention . The focus prepare serve meal meet recently revise Dietary Guidelines Americans ( 2005 ) . Annual training session reinforce monthly visit intervention Head Start school . Our experience Pathways program suggest federally mandate nutrition program ( National School Lunch School Breakfast Programs ) necessarily follow precisely individual site , emphasize Dietary Guidelines reinforce NSLP SBP requirement train session follow-up visit center . As school participate Pathways program , anticipate training session visit meet enthusiasm . To engage family support involvement CHILE , intervention include home- Head Start-based activity family . The home-based component include activity parent child home , prepare healthful snack , take walk , play active game together . These activity introduce Family Events , hold four time year , re-enforced take home material . Families ask limit television view screen time 2 hour less per day . This introduce re-enforced Family Events . Family Events include activity hands-on food preparation taste-testing fruit , vegetable , whole grain food , label reading , grocery store field trip , `` Ask Doctor '' ( special one-on-one interaction local participate health care provider ) , booths demonstrate concept content child learn classroom .</detailed_description>
