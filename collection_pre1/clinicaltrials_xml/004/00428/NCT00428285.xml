	<brief_title>Tolerability , Safety , &amp; Efficacy Argon Plasma Coagulation Treat Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia HIV-Positive Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infect men sex men ( MSM ) increase risk develop anal cancer compare general population incidence continue increase despite good control HIV infection HAART ( Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy ) . The causative agent know Human Papilloma Virus infection lead dysplastic change anus , detectable High Resolution Anoscopy biopsy . The analysis abnormal tissue grade Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia 1 3 , AIN 2 3 consider high grade dysplasia . These lesion cancer precursor , proportion lesion progress invasive anal cancer time event unknown . There currently recognize treatment offer standard care although general belief treat lesion , do woman CIN 2 3 ( Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ) could help decrease number progression invasive anal cancer MSM infect HIV . By experience center result technique gastrointestinal pathology , believe Argon Plasma Coagulation ( APC ) could safe , well tolerated efficient treatment high-grade dysplasia ( AIN 2/3 ) HIV infect MSM . This study assess APC treatment 20 patient , HIV infect MSM , establish AIN 2/3 ( confirm last two anal biopsy , least 4 month apart ) . Patients follow regular High Resolution Anoscopies two year . The primary objective ass APC safe well tolerate treatment method AIN 2/3 HIV-positive MSM . As secondary objective , efficacy APC treatment AIN 2/3 lesion HIV-positive MSM , number treatment APC necessary obtain regression resolution AIN 2/3 two year efficacy APC treatment decrease anal HPV population also address .</detailed_description>
