	<brief_summary>Background - HGS-ETR2 monoclonal antibody , produce laboratory human gene . - HGS-ETR2 target protein call TRAIL receptor locate surface tumor cell . When TRAIL receptor activate , cause tumor cell self-destruct . Objectives : - To determine high dose HGS-ETR2 give safely child young adult cancer . - To study pharmacology ( body handle drug ) HGS-ETR2 measure amount drug bloodstream time dose give patient . - To determine HGS-ETR2 stop slow tumor growth . - To determine whether protein tumor tissue treatment predict whether tumor respond HGS-ETR2 therapy . Eligibility : -Patients 1 21 year age solid cancer respond standard therapy . Design : - HGS-ETR2 give vein ( intravenously , IV ) every 14 day . Each treatment cycle 28 day long consist two dos HGS-ETR2 . - The dose HGS-ETR2 increase successive small group patient maximum tolerate dose ( high dose acceptable side effect ) determine . - During treatment period , patient physical examination least week , routine blood test least twice week . These test do less frequently later treatment cycle . - Additional blood sample draw immunology pharmacology study . - Tests monitor size tumor ( X-rays , CT scan , MRI , PET scan ) do periodically throughout treatment period . - Patients may continue receive HGS-ETR2 unacceptable side effect develop tumor grows .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Pediatric solid tumor represent approximately one fourth cancer diagnose child . Despite intensive regimen , patient metastatic recurrent tumor unsatisfactory survival rate . Therefore new therapy need improve outcome . Members TNF ligand superfamily induce death tumor cell direct ligation death receptor apoptosis induction . TRAIL ( TNF-related apoptosis induce ligand ) specific anti-tumor activity wide range tumor cell without induce death normal cell . TRAIL-induced apoptosis demonstrate wide variety pediatric solid tumor , include Ewing 's sarcoma , osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma . HGS-ETR2 ( Human Genome Sciences ; human monoclonal antibody ) fully human monoclonal antibody agonistically bind TRAIL receptor 2 , like TRAIL , induce apoptosis variety malignant cell type little effect normal cell . Limited caspase 8 expression primary factor limit TRAIL mediate cell death tumor ; interferon gamma show effective increase caspase-8 expression tumor restore sensitivity tumor TRAIL mediate cell death . Objectives : To determine tolerance adult maximum tolerate dose dose limit toxicity lexatumumab patient refractory pediatric solid tumor . To determine MTD lexatumumab presence fix dose interferon gamma 1b 25 mcg/m ( 2 ) SC three times/week , less FDA approve dose . To assess pharmacokinetics lexatumumab lexatumumab combination interferon gamma 1b patient pediatric malignant tumor refractory standard therapy . Eligibility : Patients must 1-30 year age solid malignant tumor refractory standard therapy . Design : A Phase I dose escalation study 4 plan dose level lexatumumab start 30 % adult MTD escalate 100 % adult MTD , follow second dose escalation use five lexatumumab dose level patient concomitantly receive interferon gamma 1b . Three ( expand six DLT occurs ) patient enrol dose level lexatumumab adult MTD reach 6 patient enrol adult MTD dose . The MTD cohort lexatumumab alone combine regimen expand include 12 patient , include minimum 6 patient less equal 12 year age . Once 6 patient great 12 year age complete lexatumumab alone , new patient great 12 year age enrol combined regimen . Similarly , 6 patient complete lexatumumab alone less equal 12 year age , new patient less equal 12 year age enrol combined regimen . A final dose escalation interferon gamma 1b perform maximum dose level lexatumumab , dose level wherein archival tissue demonstrate upregulation caspase 8 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : AGE : Patients must great equal 1 year less equal 30 year age order encompass broad range age child well capture young adult population highly represent many type sarcomas study . DIAGNOSIS : Histologically confirm solid tumor , may include limited rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor , osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma , Wilm tumor , Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients primary untreated metastatic CNS tumor primary metastatic hepatic tumor treat study . MEASURABLE/EVALUABLE DISEASE : Patients must measurable evaluable tumor . PRIOR THERAPY : The patient cancer must relapse follow failed respond standard therapy , patient current disease state must one know curative therapy therapy proven prolong survival acceptable quality life . Patients must complete last dose irradiation , chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody , investigational therapy least 4 week prior enrollment last dose nitrosurea ( CCNU , BCNU ) 6 week prior enrollment . For patient undergone autologous stem cell transplantation , least 3 month must elapse since transplant . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy prior enrollment . Patients must colony stimulate factor ( e.g . GCSF , GMCSF , Epo ) least 72 hour prior enrollment . Patients must complete biological therapy ( include investigational therapy ) least 7 day prior study entry . PERFORMANCE STATUS : Patients great 10 year old must Karnofsky Score great equal 50 child less equal 10 year old must Lansky score great 50 . Patients unable walk paralysis weakness , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION : Patients must adequate bone marrow function , define peripheral absolute granulocyte count great equal 1000/microliter , hemoglobin great equal 8 gm/dl , transfusion independent platelet count great equal 75,000/microliter . Cardiac Function : Patients must ejection fraction great 40 % via MUGA Echo shorten fraction great 27 % Echo must history congestive heart failure . HEPATIC FUNCTION : Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , less equal 2.5fold upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Direct bilirubin within normal limit . RENAL FUNCTION : Patients must normal ageadjusted serum creatinine ( see Table ) OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) . Age Less equal 5 max serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 0.8 Age less 5 less equal 10 max serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.0 Age less 10 less equal 15 max serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.2 Less 15 max serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.5 INFORMED CONSENT : All patient legal guardian ( patient less than18 year old ) must sign document inform consent ( Pediatric Oncology Branch , NCI screen protocol NIH patient ) prior perform study determine patient eligibility . After confirmation eligibility , patient legal guardian must voluntarily sign IRB approve protocol specific inform study willingness receive therapy undergo research study involve include pharmacokinetic study .
