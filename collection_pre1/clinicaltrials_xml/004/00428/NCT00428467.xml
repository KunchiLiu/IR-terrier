	<brief_title>Apical Compression Stitch - New Option LV Remodelling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure common disease remain grow cause morbidity mortality worldwide . The poor prognosis dietetic medical treatment lead Increasing interest interventional surgical technique improvement LV function . Besides heart transplantation surgical intervention heart failure patient focus mitral valve repair , biventricular stimulation correction coronary artery disease . A partial ventriculectomy true remodelling procedure invent Battista vary clinical result report high mortality 20 % . More commonly use Dor procedure , applicable anterior wall aneurysm excellent short long term result . On hand design chronic aneurysm suitable dilated cardiomyopathy subacute infarction . More recently medical device like Acorn™ net Myosplint™ invent . Both require implantation significant foreign material combine inherent disadvantage . The Acorn™ device prevents progressive dilatation , support systolic ventricular function , whereas Myospilnt™ create less spherical geometry physiological shape leave ventricle ( LV ) . Detailed knowledge underlie geometrical change fail leave ventricle prerequisite achieve improvement function surgery . It describe progressive heart failure , oval form change towards spherical geometry . To classify shape amount deformation , several index define . The classical sphericity index ( SI ) ratio short long axis commonly use able predict volume increase e.g . myocardial infarction . Furthermore , use evaluation remodelling surgery mitral valve repair heart failure patient . This index serve well overall judgement leave ventricular geometry , pay attention asymmetrical aspect remodelling heart failure , present e.g . myocardial infarction . Especially apex consider sufficiently , although reshape ideally procedure like Dor operation . Therefore focus region leave ventricle desirable surgical point view . Cine MRI scan heart gain increase acceptance diagnosis ventricular geometry change , highly accurate determine global myocardial function without use ionise radiation assumption ventricular shape , major drawback image modality nuclear ventriculography echocardiography , respectively . The current study analysis LV geometry fail LVs measure MRI scan respect systolic versus diastolic function . A new surgical method remodelling enlarge left ventricle introduce .</detailed_description>
