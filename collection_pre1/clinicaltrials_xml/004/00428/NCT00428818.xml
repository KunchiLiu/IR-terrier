	<brief_summary>Background : In many community , skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) MRSA become prevalent infection β-lactam susceptible bacteria . This necessitated alter empiric antimicrobial therapy SSTI cover MRSA . Objective : To evaluate empiric therapy trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole doxycycline outpatient SSTI area high MRSA prevalence . Design : Randomized , prospective , open-label investigation . Setting : Emergency Department Parkland Hospital Dallas , Texas . Patients : Adults SSTI . Intervention : Empiric oral therapy trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( 160 mg/800 mg , twice daily ) doxycycline ( 100 mg , twice daily ) . Measurement : The primary endpoint clinical failure define hospitalization change antibiotic therapy 10 14 day initial emergency department evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As MRSA likely isolate SSTI β-lactam susceptible organism Parkland Hospital Dallas , Texas , perform randomize , prospective , open-label investigation emergency department determine efficacy empiric therapy use off-patent oral antibiotic ( trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg twice daily doxycycline 100 mg twice daily 7 day ) outpatient treatment SSTI abscesses , require wound pack incision drainage require hospitalization . Only SSTI require wound pack enrolled eliminate inclusion small SSTI require wound pack . This investigation approve The University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board include adult ( ≥ 18 year old ) willing able provide inform consent . Inclusion criterion include able return follow-up 2 5 day enrollment accessible telephone follow-up assessment 10 14 day 28 35 day enrollment . Exclusion criterion exclude patient contraindication history hypersensitivity reaction study treatment regimen , infect prosthesis device , concomitant bacteremia deep infection ( e.g . osteomyelitis , necrotizing fasciitis , endocarditis ) , diabetic foot infection , know immunodeficiency , pregnant breastfeeding , requirement additional antimicrobial agent , obtain assigned antibiotic . The primary endpoint study clinical failure define subsequent hospital admission , administration intravenous antibiotic , change oral antibiotic period 10-14 day initial emergency department presentation . Repeated outpatient incision drainage SSTI 2 5 day enrollment consider clinical failure , antibiotic change intravenous antibiotic administer . The trial enrol patient October 2005 May 2006 . Method randomization generation random number use www.randomizer.org , alternately assign two treatment group , sort number consecutively determine sequence assign treatment group consecutively recruit patient . Statistical analysis perform SigmaStat 3.0 software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois ) . This investigation external funding .</detailed_description>
