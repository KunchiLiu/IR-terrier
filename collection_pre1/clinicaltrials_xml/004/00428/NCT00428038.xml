	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate easily gas take lung . We compare infant born premature &lt; 32 week gestation infant bear full term &gt; 37 week . We hope evaluate difference two group order learn premature lung growth development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Pulmonary Diffusion Capacity Healthy Infants Infants With Chronic Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize infant bear prematurely clinically without chronic respiratory disease lower lung diffusion capacity healthy infant bear full term , evaluate comparable post-conception age . In addition , prematurely born infant develop chronic lung disease even low diffusion capacity healthy premature infant full term infant . A low diffusion capacity , normalized lung volume , would consistent decreased alveolarization alveolar surface area infant bear prematurely . We study age range 1 24 month represent period rapid lung growth .</detailed_description>
