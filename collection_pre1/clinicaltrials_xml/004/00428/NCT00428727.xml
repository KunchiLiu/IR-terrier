	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers Using Nitric Oxide Releasing Patch : PATHON</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) constitute one important public health problem worldwide impact due high prevalence enormous social economic consequence . It believe 135 million diabetic , number expect increase 300 million next 25 year ( 30 % develop 70 % develop country ) [ 1 ; 2 ] . This epidemic related several factor like ethnicity , long life expectancy , epidemiological nutritional transition develop country due urbanization process bring obesity sedentarism [ 3 ; 4 ] . In Colombia , 2002 basic health indicator show 2 % prevalence DM . However , believe number underestimated [ 5 ] . Diabetic Foot Ulcers ( DFU ) one chronic consequence DM constitute important cause non-traumatic amputation Inferior Limbs ( IL ) , associate high human , social economic cost [ 6-11 ] . It estimate approximately 15 % diabetic population develop DFU time life [ 12-16 ] . DFU consequence two frequent chronic complication DM : Peripheral neuropathy vascular insufficiency [ 12 ] . The combination factor association mechanic extrinsic intrinsic aggression , like foot bone deformation , trigger ulcer formation . This polyfactorial etiopathology explain multidisciplinary approach require disease [ 17-19 ] . The early detection risk factor DFU may prevent appearance [ 20-28 ] . This monitoring neuropathic , vascular muscle-skeletal function [ 29 ] , reinforcement self care [ 30 ] , control glycemic level prevention traumatic foot lesion [ 31-34 ] , positive impact prevention pathology . The wound heal process involve interaction multiple cellular group , extra cellular matrix molecule growth factor [ 35 ] , affect vascular insufficiency , severity lesion presence infection [ 18 ; 36 ] . Immune wound heal mechanism dysfunction describe diabetic patient [ 37 ] . This alteration immune response characterize decrease adherence leukocytes capillary endothelium , chemotaxis damage reduction ability polymorphonuclear cell phagocyte destroy bacteria due minor production Nitric Oxide ( NO ) [ 38 ; 39 ] . Diabetic patient also show diminution fibroblast activity provoke unavailability glucose aerobic metabolism , lead inadequate fibrous collagen tissue proliferation [ 40 ] . The imbalance process describe main cause appearance persistence DFU [ 41 ] . Alternative therapy DFU propose , tissue engineering , growth factor , hyperbaric oxygen therapy [ 42 ; 43 ] ketanserine [ 44 ; 45 ] . Various type product also use keep wound dry cover ( hydrogel , hydrocolloid , alginates foam [ 46 ] , however , effective treatment pathology [ 47 ; 48 ] . In normal condition , NO continuously produce [ 49 ] tightly link many physiological process , among wound healing . It describe NO stimulates collagen synthesis [ 50 ] , trigger release chemotactic cytokine [ 51 ] , important microbicidal effect interfere enzymatic process bacterial mitochondrial respiratory chain [ 52 ] . It also increase blood vessel permeability [ 53-56 ] , promote angiogenic activity , stimulate release epidermal growth factor [ 57 ; 58 ] . Various study , perform murine model , demonstrate role NO healing process . The level final metabolic product NO ( nitrite nitrate ) rise first two day subsequently liquid recover sponge previously place subcutaneous tissue healthy subject ' wound [ 59 ] , increase observe diabetic subject [ 60 ] , suggest impairment cutaneous production NO diabetic individual . The topical use NO accelerate wound heal process excisional wound NO inhibitor increase heal time lesion [ 61 ; 62 ] . The use colloid NO donor diabetic subject show adequate granulation closing wound [ 63 ; 64 ] . Our experience treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis s-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( SNAP ) , NO donor , show beneficial effect without adverse event [ 65 ] . Moreover , clinical trial conduct study effectiveness control NO release patch treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis [ 66 ] . Currently , study use topical NO donor humans diabetic ulcer . Though use NO donor healthy volunteer show adequate NO diffusion rate dermis , increase microcapillar blood flow [ 67 ] , method demonstrate effective due short half life release span NO [ 68 ] . This difficulty control stability release NO lead development new NO releasing patch ( NOP ) . This device , produce electrospinning technique [ 69 ] , multilayer polymeric transdermal patch principal component stabilize encapsulated nanofibers guarantee constant NO release upon hydration . Since well know system generate NO almost immediately , nitrite ion bound ionic exchange resin ( DOWEX® ) order stabilize , allow constant release 3.5 µmol NO 12 hour [ 69 ] depend upon dosage . This device test group treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis obtain encouraging result heal process report serious adverse event [ 70 ] . Since specific effective treatment DFU group propose investigate topical use NOP , elaborate electrospinning technique , treatment DFU . Objectives General Objective To evaluate effectiveness safety NOP treatment DFU . Specific Objectives 1 . To evaluate heal process DFU use NOP compare placebo . 2 .
