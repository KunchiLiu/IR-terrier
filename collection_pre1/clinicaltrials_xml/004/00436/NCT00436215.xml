	<brief_summary>Background : - Sorafenib bevacizumab anti-cancer drug work target blood vessel allow tumor grow . Using two drug together may effectively block formation blood vessel fee tumor . - Sorafenib bevacizumab approve Food Drug Administration use cancer ovarian cancer . In preliminary trial drug combination , however , tumor 6 14 patient ovarian cancer shrank . Objectives : - To determine safety activity combination sorafenib bevacizumab treat patient ovarian , fallopian peritoneal cancer . - To determine sorafenib bevacizumab may affect cancer measure amount different protein small biopsy sample tumor take start treatment 6 week . Eligibility : - Females 18 year age old ovarian , fallopian , peritoneal cancer whose disease respond standard treatment standard treatment available . - Patients must previously treat bevacizumab must disease worsen take bevacizumab-based therapy . Design : - Patients take 200 mg sorafenib mouth twice day Monday Friday week 5 mg/kg bevacizumab vein every 2 week . - Tumor biopsy image scan ( magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) do treatment , 3 day begin treatment , 6 week therapy . - Computed tomography ( CT ) image test do every 8 week evaluate response treatment . - History , physical examination , blood urine test do periodically treatment health check research purpose . - About 74 patient enrolled trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Sorafenib inhibitor wild-type mutant proto-oncogene BRaf ( B-Raf ) proto-oncogene c-Raf ( c-Raf ) kinase isoforms vitro , also inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 ) , proto-oncogene c-kit ( c-kit ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGFR ) -Beta affect tumor growth well possibly promote apoptosis event downstream c-Raf . Bevacizumab humanize immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) bind biologically active isoforms human vascular endothelial growth factor ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF-A ) high affinity ( kd = 1.1nM ) . Phase I trial sorafenib bevacizumab administer concurrently show activity combination patient refractory ovarian cancer . Objectives : Determine activity tolerability combination bevacizumab sorafenib patient refractory recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian , peritoneal cancer patient bevacizumab-naive bevacizumab-resistant . Eligibility : Adults histologically document refractory recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian , peritoneal cancer . Patients must prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy least 4 week . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 1 less . Patients must disease amenable biopsy . Patients must previously treat bevacizumab must progress prior bevacizumab-based therapy . Design : Patients stratify entrance trial base previous exposure bevacizumab either strata A ( bevacizumab-naive patient ) strata B ( patient previously treat bevacizumab ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib 200 mg twice daily 5 7 day week intravenous bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two week . Tumor biopsy obtain patient treatment six week therapy . Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) obtain patient treatment , day 3 treatment , six week therapy . Patients evaluate response every 8 week use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . Approximately 74 patient need achieve objective trial .</detailed_description>
