	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder serious mental illness significant mortality morbidity [ 1 ] . Some estimate prevalence Western population high 6.4 % [ 2 ] . The depressive aspect bipolar disorder often overlook , possibly due less dramatic nature , despite significant impact live suffer [ 3 ] . Bipolar depression associate twenty fold increase risk suicide [ 4 ] , typically last three five time long manic hypomanic episode [ 5 , 6 ] . Despite , relatively sparse investigation treatment bipolar depression , guideline base primarily expert judgment rather randomize control trial [ 7 ] . First line treatment typically involve treatment mood stabilizer - lithium , sodium valproate carbamazepine [ 7 ] . Addition antidepressant SSRI , buproprion venlafaxine may indicate depression persists , although possibility induce rapid cycling manic manic episode . Alternative agent lamotrigine atypical antipsychotic may also consider [ 7 ] . However , little firm evidence area , lack controlled study treatment bipolar depression describe Thase 2005 [ 7 ] , `` embarrassment field '' . In addition lack evidence efficacy , clear significant proportion patient bipolar depression respond range commonly use treatment include medication combination [ 8 ] . It clear depressive phase bipolar disorder important clinical problem one considerable need development new treatment . rTMS technique first develop mid 1980 's involves use time variable magnetic field stimulate brain activity . rTMS method generally find well tolerate , safe without complication use anesthetic require invasive form brain stimulation electroconvulsive therapy . The ability rTMS affect mood first note normal control late 1980 's . Studies use focal stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) depression first appear mid 1990 's [ 9-11 ] . These study produce promising result reduce depression severity follow leave prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) stimulation . Since time considerable number trial leave DLPFC rTMS conduct . The majority study use 5-20 Hz stimulation frequency . Most predominately small sample size short duration ( i.e. , 10 treatment ) ( CIA pub 11 ) . They also confound concern choice sham stimulation type [ 12 ] variation stimulation 'dose ' provide . The study robust clinical effect use high number pulse per subject high stimulation intensity level , suggest dose - response relationship ( CIA pub 2,11 ) . They almost exclusively focused treatment patient unipolar major depression although study include subset patient BPAD-DP . There least 6 meta-analyses antidepressant effect leave PFC rTMS . All one show great antidepressant effect 2 week HFL-TMS compare sham ; include analysis 6 report [ 13 ] , 12 study [ 14 ] , 16 study [ 15 ] , 10 study [ 16 ] Cochrane review 14 [ 17 ] . The single negative study include 6 report 91 subject less power meta-analyses . Of large study , Holtzheimer et al report weighted mean effect size 0.81 [ 14 ] , Burt et al report effect size 0.67 [ 15 ] Kozel al effect size 0.53 [ 16 ] . These moderate large effect . However , study repeatedly report overall clinical result observe impressive . For example , mean overall improvement 23.8 % HAMD blind study review [ 14 ] compare 7.3 % sham group . Attempting address issue definitely establish efficacy rTMS depression , large international trial recently complete . Conducted private TMS manufacturer ( Neuronetics Pty Ltd ) , involve randomized trial HFL-TMS ( 10Hz ) compare placebo 9 week treatment . The result study show statistically superiority active sham rTMS treatment [ 18 ] . Currently , result trial utilized support FDA application Neuronetics device treatment depression ( M Demitrack , personal communication ) . In addition sham control trial , also series trial compare HFL-TMS ECT [ 19-22 ] . Encouragingly , report difference response rate ECT HFL-TMS except one study include psychotic patient ( show great benefit ECT psychotic group [ 22 ] ) second trial recently report well response bilateral unilateral ECT unlimited treatment duration compare fixed course 3 week unilateral leave PFC rTMS [ 23 ] . However , study necessarily sufficient power detect subtle difference group . More recently , several alternative rTMS paradigm show promise . Low frequency rTMS apply right PFC ( LFR-TMS ) , contrary high frequency rTMS , know reduce local cortical excitability [ 24 ] . The initial trial LFR-TMS establish efficacy non treatment resistant sample patient [ 25 ] . Funded previous NHMRC grant , conduct research establish efficacy LFR-TMS compare HFL-TMS placebo ( CIA 15 ) : Previous Study 1 : In study , 60 patient randomize either HFL-TMS LFR-TMS sham stimulation condition ( n=20 group ) . All treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) fail multiple antidepressant medication trial ( mean number = 5.7 ± 3.4 ) . There baseline clinical demographic difference three group . Over double blind phase study clearly antidepressant effect active group superior response sham stimulation . There continued improvement active group across 4 week study : group whole , 4 week treatment mean percentage change MADRS score baseline 48.0 ± 17.9 % ( range 15.1 - 87.5 % ) . These result demonstrate HFL-TMS LFR-TMS substantial therapeutic efficacy robust clinical response appear require least 20 session treatment parameter use . However , sub-population patient respond treatment . The equivalence HFL-TMS LFR-TMS also demonstrate recent study [ 26 ] . Previous Study 2 : We also conduct large scale clinical effectiveness trial LFR-TMS compare 1 Hz 2 Hz stimulation right PFC ( CIA 47 ) . This study involve randomization 130 patient treatment resistant major depression receive right PFC stimulation single daily 15 minute train either 1 2 Hz . 2 Hz stimulation investigate potential way double number apply stimulus within identical treatment time ( increase treatment dose potentially enhance treatment response ) . Treatment response equivalent 2 group ( 62.3 24.0 % change 1 Hz group , 64.7 21.0 % change 2 Hz group 4 week ) difference response . This support substitution 2 Hz optimal condition LFR-TMS . Another alternative paradigm sequential bilateral rTMS ( SBrTMS ) , application HFL-TMS LFR-TMS , one treatment session . We recently complete first large study technique first extend treatment beyond 10 day ( CIA 33 ) : Previous Study 3 . In study conduct , combine HFL-TMS LFR-TMS sequentially treatment session trial compare active sham stimulation ( n=50 , 25 per group ) . Importantly , treatment provide 6 week , longer previously publish rTMS trial . In study clearly mark benefit active sham stimulation . There significant difference group 2 week ( F ( 1,25 ) =25.5 , p &lt; 0.001 ) remain significant trial time point ( F ( 5,44 ) =3.9 , p=0.005 ) . Patients continue respond across 6 week active treatment . Most critically , study end , 13 25 patient active group ( &gt; 50 % ) 2 sham group meet response criterion HAMD . 9 patient active group ( 36 % ) patient sham group meet criterion clinical remission . A 45 % patient sham group cross active treatment trial end go respond manner meeting response criterion ( 33 % remission criterion ) . rTMS Bipolar Disorder - Depressive Phase Markedly few trial conduct investigate effect rTMS BPAD . Of , small number focus treatment mania use high-frequency stimulation apply right DLPFC . Initial open study technique appear promising , although negative result also publish [ 27 ] need substantive definitive trial . Even few study focus specifically treatment BPAD-DP . In first , Dolberg et al randomize 20 patient HFL-TMS placebo [ 28 ] . Unfortunately brief report publish provide experimental detail active group appear good sham group 2 week treatment . In contrast , randomize trial , Nahas et al find difference response active HFL-TMS sham study 23 patient [ 29 ] . In study , response rate 36 % active 33 % sham group . The author question whether type sham coil use really part 'active ' due degree brain stimulation produce coil orientation apply . The group follow 7 patient respond active rTMS 12 month provide weekly maintenance rTMS [ 30 ] . There appear degree benefit maintenance treatment although difficult quantify due open nature follow . The source information usefulness rTMS BPAD-DP come description response patient general trial mixed sample . Unfortunately , large study include Neuronetics trial describe [ 18 ] exclude BPAD patient study small sample allow meaningful data extract subgroup . In study conduct , none design directly investigate rTMS response BPAD , total 50 BPAD-DP treated date . These treat across 5 separate trial . In trial number subject limited draw useful inference . However , total 21 patient BPAD-DP receive LFR-TMS clinical effectiveness trial describe 4 week period ( study 2 ) . In group , significant reduction Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD ) score baseline week 2 ( baseline = 21.6 ±5.7 , week 2 = 12.0±6.3 , p &lt; 0.001 ) baseline week 4 ( baseline = 21.6 ±5.7 , week 4 = 9.7±6.3 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Interestingly give first publish sample treatment duration great 2 week , group show significant reduction HAMD score week 2 4 ( p &lt; 0.05 ) indicating benefit long period treatment . 15 ( 71 % ) patient meet response criterion ( &gt; 50 % reduction HAMD score trial end ) . Although study include sham control group , strongly suggest low frequency right side rTMS therapeutic potential BPAD-DP warrant conduct definitive randomize controlled trial . Despite widespread communication within international rTMS research community ( CIA grant committee member International Society Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ) , aware large study explore use rTMS BPAD-DP complete unpublished currently underway . In addition , aware current past study explore role LFR-TMS condition . OTHER GAPS IN THE LITERATURE Clearly BPAD relapse illness substantive data impact rTMS long term outcome . Long term follow-up data rTMS treatment limited general . One study report similar 6 month relapse rate follow rTMS ECT treatment [ 31 ] consider outcome limited group patient ( n=21 rTMS group ) . Unpublished data Neuronetics trial ( CIA 52 ) suggest relapse rate post rTMS similar low see previously publish large ECT study ( M Demitrack , personal communication ) . We report relapse re-treatment average time 9 month post acute treatment sample comprehensively follow end acute treatment relapse ( CIA 36 ) . We aim significantly contribute understand outcome treatment include structure assessment 12 month follow period study . Hypotheses / Research Questions Primary Hypotheses 1 . Treatment high frequency leave sided rTMS result great reduction HAMD score sham rTMS . 2 . Treatment low frequency right side rTMS result great reduction HAMD score sham rTMS . Secondary Hypotheses 3 . Greater 50 % treatment responder rTMS continue experience clinical benefit rTMS , indexed HAMD score remain within 25 % HAMD score achieve end acute treatment phase 6 month post acute treatment follow . 4 . Treatment high frequency leave sided rTMS low frequency right side rTMS well tolerate assess retention rate treatment great 90 % . Methodology include project design sequence procedure Experimental Design The study design allow report result manner consistent international CONSORT guideline . The study involve 4-week ( 20 session ) randomize double-blind clinical trial 3 treatment arm conduct two site ( Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre Melbourne Centre Addiction Mental Health , Department Psychiatry , University Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) . Randomization occur via generation computer number sequence stratification site diagnosis bipolar I bipolar II disorder . Subjects randomize immediately prior commencement first treatment session , measurement bilateral rest motor threshold standard mean ( CIA 2 ) . The main study phase ( phase 1 ) involve 4 week randomize control trial conduct strict double-blind condition . Fidelity blind process assessed end period patient raters . Phase 2 involve provision open label treatment LFR-TMS patient receive sham treatment wish receive 'active ' rTMS . Responders active treatment phase 1 2 enter phase 3 , 6 month follow period participant reassess 2 week , 1 , 3 , 6 month . Subjects Sample Size We aim recruit 40 patient group ( total n=120 ) . The sample size calculation study conduct base within group standard deviation 7 ( upper limit standard deviation bipolar patient HAMD score low frequency right side rTMS trial data provide ) group difference 5.0 point ( change 2 active group 12 ( base 4 week change data ) change 7 sham group allow substantial placebo response ) . With alpha 0.05 study power 0.91 detect difference end score 3 group ( calculation PASS 8.0 ) . Clinical Measures Demographic variables potential co-variates record baseline follow clinical interview . These include duration current episode , year first diagnosis , number previous episode , type dose current previous treatment family history mood disorder . Clinical measure perform randomization , 2 4 week well follow assessment . A trained rater blind treatment type administer measure . Raters require maintain &gt; 90 % reliability primary outcome assessment rating 6 monthly assessment base videotaped interview . The primary outcome variable score 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD ) [ 33 ] . In addition use Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS ) - Clinician Version Patient version [ 34 ] . In addition , rate patient Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) ass possibility emergent manic symptom [ 35 ] . Assessments make baseline explore potential predictor clinical response include CORE rating melancholia [ 36 ] , Measure Parental Styles [ 37 ] , Depressive Personality Inventory [ 38 ] Costello Comrey trait anxiety measure [ 39 ] . To assess possibility rTMS treatment may result cognitive side effect , assess cognition baseline end 4 week treatment follow test . They may also provide evidence improved executive / frontal functioning produce treatment : Personal Memory Questionnaire , Block Design Test , Verbal Paired Associates Recall Recognition , Visual Paired Associates , Digit Span ( WAIS ) , Simple Complex Reaction Time , Finger Tapping Test , Verbal Fluency , Trail make A &amp; B . TMS Treatment TMS administer Medtronic Magpro30 magnetic stimulators use 70mm figure 8 coil . Prior commencement treatment TMS , single pulse TMS use measure rest motor threshold ( RMT ) abductor pollicis brevis ( APB ) bilaterally subject use standard publish method ( CIA 2 ) . Stimulation parameter rTMS administer daily basis 5 day per week subject : Left : 10Hz , 110 % RMT , 40 Trains , 5 second duration , 25 second inter-train interval ( i.e. , 2000 pulse ) Right : 1 Hz , 110 % RMT , 1 Train 1200 pulse Sham : Sham patient successively randomize sham stimulation either leave right stimulation parameter use sham coil . The session match treatment duration . Missed session 'made ' extension treatment duration one miss session allow per week . The two active condition match approximate treatment duration rather pulse number keep previous research ( CIA 15 ) . Matching pulse number would result either leave treatment schedule significantly few pulse appear effective study excessively long right treatment schedule . Stimulation localization This follow slight modification standard procedure . Firstly , site optimal activation abductor pollicis brevis muscle contralateral hand locate whilst stimulate relevant motor cortical region supra-threshold intensity . This site mark scalp . We measure 6 cm anteriorly scalp surface mark ink . This point use site stimulation . The majority rTMS study measure 5 cm anteriorly . However , show result consistently localization posterior dorsolateral PFC [ 40 ] . The measurement describe result consistent treatment dorsolateral PFC still provide considerable stimulation overlap establish ' 5 cm ' site . MRI scan Each subject undergo 3D sagittally orientate T1 weight structural MR scan 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner Alfred Toronto Western Hospital ( 128 slice ) . Analysis scalp cortex distance prefrontal cortex site stimulation conduct use previously publish method [ 41 ] post doctoral research fellow considerable experience structural neuroimaging analysis use ANALYSE software package . During scan , site motor cortex stimulation site mark scalp 2 vitamin E capsule . This also allow post hoc analysis actual site stimulation comparison cortical landmark DLPFC . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) EEG treatment use examine mean absolute spectral power within 5 frequency band . The mean absolute power ( square microvolt per hertz ) compute within follow 5 frequency band : delta ( 0.5-3.5 Hz ) , theta ( 3.5-7.5 Hz ) ; alpha ( 7.5-12.5 Hz ) ; beta 1 ( 12.5-20.5 Hz ) , beta 2 ( 20.5-32.5 Hz ) . EEG activation / spectral power assess rest ( eye open close ) cognitive engagement several task . Concurrent Treatment Medications continue rTMS consider safe . Patients enter study dose increase 4 week prior randomization significant improvement ( &gt; 15 % change ) depression one week screen first study assessment visit ( base HAMD rating two visit ) . The commencement new psychotropic medication allow 4 week prior study entry study period . The continuation antidepressant medication / mood stabilizer place trial realistic clinical framework . We minimize confound effect medication : 1 . Ensuring patient stable ( stable dose improve ) prior entry . 2 . Controlling medication status secondary statistical analyzes . This way deal medication effect appear quite satisfactory previous trial ( CIA 15 , 33 ) confound treatment effect . Statistical Analysis The primary analysis conduct HAMD secondary analysis IDS score baseline week 4 use 'last observation carry forward ' method case subject exit study prematurely . ANOVA test 2 test use examine difference demographic clinical characteristic group continuous categorical variable follow test normality data . Repeated measure general linear model compute look difference group score across study time point ( baseline , week 2 , week 4 ) group subject variable . Concurrent antidepressant use include secondary analysis covariate . Analysis follow phase descriptively compare number patient continue report depressive symptom HAMD threshold clinical response . 1 .
