	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate safety , tolerability effectiveness oral cladribine take combination Interferon-beta ( IFN-beta ) therapy treatment multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . This study randomize around 200 subject approximately 50 site locate world-wide , experience least one relapse take IFN-beta therapy within 48 week prior Screening , irrespective disability progression . Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) subject , still experience relapse , subject receive disease modify drug ( DMDs ) , IFN-beta therapy , MS treatment history , currently IFN-beta therapy experience active MS symptom ( least 1 relapse ) 48 week prior Screening , may also enrol . Subjects randomize 2:1 fashion receive 4 cycle oral cladribine match placebo combination IFN-beta therapy . Subjects complete double-blind portion study invite participate open-label extension phase match study design . Total participation 96 week double blind period , 48 week open label extension phase .</brief_summary>
