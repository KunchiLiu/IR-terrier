	<brief_summary>Group A streptococcus ( GAS ) bacteria cause many different sickness child adult . This study look number case pyoderma ( bacterial skin infection ) scabies ( skin mite cause itch ) 550 infant 12 month young Fiji . ( GAS cause pyoderma , sometimes skin site infested scabies become infected GAS bacteria . ) The study also look makeup GAS certain medication affect GAS . The infant involve study approximately 1 week . Their skin examine pyoderma scabies . A swab sample take pyoderma area test GAS . The researcher hope see often skin infection occur affect Fijian population . The information help researcher develop well treatment possibly vaccine prevent infection . Infants pyoderma define `` great mild '' refer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus , common infective agent child adult , cause wide range clinical disease bacterium . This study fourth five study large project aim evaluate epidemiology infection cause group A streptococcus ( GAS ) Fiji . This large project call Fiji Group A Streptococcal Project ( Fiji GrASP ) . Fiji GrASP turn part large program aim progression novel GAS vaccine - program project entitle `` Global GAS Vaccine Based M-Protein . '' The three broad aim Fiji GrASP epidemiologic study : ( 1 ) establish burden disease GAS infection Fiji ; ( 2 ) describe molecular epidemiology GAS isolate Fiji ; ( 3 ) establish natural immunologic correlate protection J8 vaccine exist . This cross-sectional study 550 infant 2-month period . Skin examine pyoderma scabies , swab take pyoderma lesion . All GAS isolates skin swabs undergo genetic sequence N-terminal C-repeat region ( J8 epitope ) M protein QIMR . One hundred skin swab undergo antimicrobial susceptibility test penicillin , erythromycin , clindamycin chloramphenicol . The primary objective study estimate point prevalence GAS pyoderma 550 infant Central Division Fiji estimate point prevalence scabies 550 infant Central Division Fiji . The secondary objective study genotypically characterize group A streptococci isolated skin swab pyoderma lesion infant Fiji determine antimicrobial susceptibility penicillin , clindamycin , erythromycin chloramphenicol 100 GAS isolates skin swab . The primary endpoint study determine number case pyoderma number case scabies . The secondary endpoint : ( 1 ) determine number child pyoderma scabies ; ( 2 ) determine number GAS isolate skin swab contain J8 epitope overall emm-type distribution GAS isolate ; ( 3 ) complete antibiograms GAS isolate skin penicillin , clindamycin , erythromycin chloramphenicol .</detailed_description>
