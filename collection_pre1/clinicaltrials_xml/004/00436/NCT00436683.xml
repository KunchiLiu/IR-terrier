	<detailed_description>High level phosphate blood link serious effect , due calcium imbalance ( high level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , bone disease , formation calcium deposit body , blood-vessel disease . Current guideline indicate blood phosphorus level maintain 1.13 1.78 mmol/L patient receive hemodialysis . The purpose study determine range dosage tolerate patient hyperphosphatemia , undergoing haemodialysis .</detailed_description>
