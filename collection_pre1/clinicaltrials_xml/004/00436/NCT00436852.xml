	<brief_title>ABT-751 Treating Children With Neuroblastoma That Has Relapsed Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time disease progression child refractory relapse neuroblastoma treat ABT-751 vs historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient measurable disease treatment drug . II . Determine whether ABT-751 improve quality life patient . III . Determine toxicity ABT-751 . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic profile ABT-751 patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral ABT-751 daily day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 52 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study . Quality life assess baseline prior course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5.1 year .</detailed_description>
