	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving erlotinib together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give erlotinib together bevacizumab work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0635 : Erlotinib Bevacizumab Stage IIIB IV Bronchioloalveolar Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall survival patient stage IIIB IV bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) adenocarcinoma BAC feature treat erlotinib hydrochloride bevacizumab . Secondary - Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare , preliminarily , response assess RECIST criterion vs response assessed central computer-assisted image-analysis system patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Assess frequency severity toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
