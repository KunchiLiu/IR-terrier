	<brief_title>A Phase Ⅱ Study Gemcitabine Combination With TS-1 Patient With Advanced Recurred Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , curative treatment pancreatic cancer surgery.But patient operable indication rare , patient present locally advanced general advance stage diagnosis . Thus majority patient need chemotherapy.But efficacy outcome seem increase overall survival compare none treat control group.In Korea incidence pancreatic cancer increase steadily . Prognosis poor . So effective treatment necessary.There phase 2 trialsabout combine gemcitabine TS-1 advance pancreatic cancer.according phase 1 trial advance pancreatic cancer ( nakamura et al ) toxicities 3 grade neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , anorexia , etc treated.Phase 1 trial study evaluate response rate . But among 21 patient evaluate response rate , 10 patient Partial response Complete response.This combination therapy seem havetolerable toxicity remarkable therapeutic effect locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer.So therapy combine gemcitabine TS-1 expect synergic additional effect . This trial phase 2 , open-label , multi-center , single arm study The total sample size 38 patient . Patient administer chemotherapy disease progression . Gemcitabine administer dose 1000 mg/m2 every 3weeks ( day 1 cycle ) TS-1 administer 80 mg/m2 orally twice daily 14 day every 3 week .</detailed_description>
