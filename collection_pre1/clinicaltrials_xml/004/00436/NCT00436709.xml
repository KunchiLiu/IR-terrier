	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together doxorubicin cyclophosphamide follow paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation bevacizumab work treat patient undergone surgery early-stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine cardiac safety adjuvant concurrent bevacizumab dose-dense doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide follow dose-dense paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation maintenance therapy comprise bevacizumab alone patient early-stage breast cancer . Secondary - Determine noncardiac toxicity regimen patient . - Determine efficacy regimen , term time tumor recurrence overall survival , patient . - Explore change circulate endothelial cell circulate tumor cell pre-treatment level patient evidence disease . - Prospectively explore use serial troponin I predictor cardiac toxicity patient treated regimen . - Prospectively explore relationship plasma renin activity hypertension patient treat bevacizumab chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophophamide IV , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 pegfilgrastim SC day 2 . Treatment paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation pegfilgrastim repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment maintenance therapy repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study treatment . Samples analyze circulate endothelial cell ( flow cytomery [ FC ] ) , circulate epithelial cell ( immunocytochemistry FC ) , troponin I concentration ( enzyme immunoassay chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay ) , plasma renin activity ( radioimmunoassay ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4-6 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 75 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
