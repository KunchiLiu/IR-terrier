	<brief_summary>Influenza virus infection cause sickness nose lung . It think type 1 interferon ( protein help immune system fight virus ) make flu vaccine effective . This study determine type 1 interferon add specific flu vaccine help immune system healthy adult fight infection well vaccine alone . Ninety volunteer , age 18-40 , participate study . They attend 3 study visit final follow-up study visit , email , phone call six month vaccination . Volunteers receive single dose study vaccine spray nose . Study procedures include blood sample nasal wash ( inside nose wash ) collect evaluate immune system response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Mucosal Adjuvant Influenza Vaccine Given Intranasally</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza primarily virus infection respiratory tract mucosa nose terminal bronchiole . Immunity influenza virus infection mediate primarily antibody respiratory secretion mucosal surface . To meet need improve inactivated vaccine , one potential approach increase frequency magnitude antibody secretion administer inactivated influenza virus vaccine ( IVV ) intranasally optimize response include mucosal adjuvant . The primary hypothesis study Type 1 interferon ( IFN ) provide adjuvant effect respiratory mucosal surface production IgA and/or IgG antibody influenza strain add IVV administer intranasally . The primary objective study determine whether include type 1 IFN IVV , administer intranasally , healthy adult enhance antibody response nasal secretion compare intranasal administration IVV alone . This single-center , randomize , double-blind , clinical trial determine type 1 IFN act mucosal adjuvant antibody response influenza virus administration IVV intranasally . Subjects healthy adult age 18 40 . The study enroll 30 subject three group , group give 0.6 ml IVV , group give 0.6 ml IVV contain 1M unit IFN group give 0.7 ml IVV contain 10M unit IFN . The vaccine vaccine/interferon combination administer subject intranasally . Blood nasal secretion obtain vaccination two four week immunization . Each subject ask complete memory aid seven day report unexpected adverse event ( AEs ) study personnel . The subject report clinic contact phone e-mail six month vaccination regard occurrence unreported serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . The three nasal secretion use test IgA IgG antibody A/H1N1 A/H3N2 HA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) test . The three blood sample test HAI neutralization test antibody A/H1N1 A/H3N2 vaccine antigen .</detailed_description>
