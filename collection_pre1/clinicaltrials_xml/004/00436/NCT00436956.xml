	<brief_summary>Background : - AZD2171 ( Cediranib ) experimental drug inhibits formation new blood vessel . - Tumors need new blood vessel grow . Preventing growth new blood vessel AZD2171 may inhibit tumor growth . Objectives : -To determine effectiveness side effect AZD2171 patient prostate cancer metastasize ( spread beyond primary site ) . Eligibility : - Males 18 year age old androgen-independent prostate cancer metastasize . - Patients must receive prior treatment docetaxel . Design : Patients take one AZD2171 mouth every day 28-day treatment cycle undergo follow procedure : - 1- 2-day hospitalization start study biopsy blood measurement determine level AZD2171 bloodstream . Blood drawn immediately first dose , 0.25 hr , 0.5 hr , 1 hr , 2 hr , 4 hr , 6 hr , 8 hr , 12 hr , 24 hr , 48 hour dose take . - Blood test start treatment monthly determine level vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , protein involved blood vessel formation . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan month evaluate blood flow . - Tumor biopsy ( optional ) second sixth treatment cycle . - Clinic visit every 4 week , include various routine research blood test , urine test electrocardiogram . - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen , pelvis every 8 week - Bone scan every 8 week Patients record dose AZD2171 take miss pill diary . They record blood pressure least daily blood pressure diary . Treatment may continue long patient tolerates AZD2171 cancer worsen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - AZD2171 ( Cediranib ) oral potent inhibitor receptor tyrosine kinases impact vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( VEGF ) . - VEGF appear important blood vessel formation disease progression prostate cancer . - No known effective therapy patient progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer treatment docetaxel . Objectives : - Primary objective study determine AZD2171 associate 30 % 6 month probability progression free survival patient metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) determine clinical radiographic criterion . - Secondary objective study demonstration biologic effect drug patient tumor ( possible ) . Correlative study conduct serially obtain tissue biopsy white blood cell collection . - Laboratory correlate include elucidation activation component VEGFR2 angiogenesis pathway evaluation endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( release damage cell ) use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , pharmacogenetic analysis kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) variant single nucleotide polymorphism , pharmacokinetic characterization AZD2171 activity . Eligibility : - Metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer . - Prior treatment docetaxel . - May correct QT interval ( QTc ) great 470 msec great 1+ proteinuria 2 consecutive dipstick less 1 week apart . Design : - Phase II trial two stage design . 12 patient enrol first cohort , 2 progression free 6 month enroll 35 evaluable patient . The ceiling set 37 allow inevaluable patient . - Starting dose 20 mg QD ( every day ) patient . - Once two stage design complete prednisone 10 mg per day give combination AZD2171 . The total number patient 23 portion protocol .</detailed_description>
