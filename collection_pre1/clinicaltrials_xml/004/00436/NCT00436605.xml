	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Stage III Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient stage III unresectable stage IV melanoma treat dasatinib . II . Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess expression target Dasatinib prior treatment obtain pre-treatment biopsy examine paraffin-embedded tissue previous tumor resection . II . In select patient ( approximately 5-10 ) tumor tissue available pre-treatment obtain post-treatment Dasatinib ( 21 day initiation therapy ) , determine Dasatinib induces change expression select target downstream mediator , include MEK , ERK RSK-1 . III . To assess toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
