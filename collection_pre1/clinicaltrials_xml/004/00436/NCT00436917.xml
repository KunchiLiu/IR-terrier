	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate may reduce bone loss patient receive letrozole breast cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well zoledronate work treat osteopenia osteoporosis postmenopausal woman receive letrozole stage I , stage II , stage IIIA primary breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate Treating Osteopenia Osteoporosis Postmenopausal Women Receiving Letrozole Stage I , Stage II , Stage IIIA Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess change total lumbar spine bone mineral density ( BMD ) baseline 12 month postmenopausal woman treat zoledronate osteopenia osteoporosis letrozole hormone receptor-positive , stage I-IIIA primary breast cancer . Secondary - Determine change total lumbar spine BMD baseline 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year patient . - Determine change femoral neck BMD baseline 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year patient . - Determine time disease progression patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . - Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Osteoporosis management : Patients receive zoledronate IV 15 minute day 1 . Patients also receive oral elemental calcium twice daily oral vitamin D daily 6 month . Treatment repeat every 6 month 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo total lumbar spine hip ( femoral neck ) bone density test dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) baseline annually 5 year . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
