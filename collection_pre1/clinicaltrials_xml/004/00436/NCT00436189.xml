	<detailed_description>Study Design This multi-center study include low high prevalence ovarian cancer site . The site representative institution potential ovarian tumor subject undergo gynecological examination radiological exam prior surgical intervention . A blood specimen take enrolled subject . This blood specimen use evaluation OvaRl test identify subject ovarian cancer within population woman document ovarian mass plan surgical intervention . Expected Total Enrollment : Up 1000 subject document ovarian mass Study Start : February 2007 Study Details : Study Population : Female subject age 18 ovarian tumor plan surgical intervention enrol 40 site . The site demographically mixed include , example , large small medical center ( universities/community hospital ) , small gynecology/obstetrics group , gynecology/oncology practice , HMO group . It anticipate 1000 subject enroll . This population exclude minor , pregnant woman , patient history malignancy last 10 year , exception non-melanoma skin cancer . You ask participate study documented mass tumor ovarian area . The Ciphergen OvaR1 assay proteomics-based blood test assist physician determine whether documented tumor cancer benign ( non-cancer ) . This necessary part treatment . You already schedule operation remove tumor , make eligible trial . If agree participate one 1000 people . Once schedule surgery , ask provide blood specimen . The blood sample prior surgery . The sample consist 30-50 ml blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw vein arm . The blood specimen process blood serum specimen store , test OvaRI assay look proteomic pattern indicative cancer non-cancer . Your serum specimen assign coded identification number protect privacy . Your research blood drawn time routine pre-operative blood work visit time surgery depend scheduling . The risk potential discomfort outside surgery associate blood draw . The primary principal investigator charge study Frederick R. Ueland , M.D. , University Kentucky . You receive personal benefit take part study . However , information obtain participation may potentially benefit patient future provide helpful information proteomic pattern connect ovarian tumor . Subject Participation Eligibility : Inclusion Criteria 1 . Subject female age 18 year old 2 . Subject level understanding sufficient agree test require protocol , must consider reliable must able cooperate study procedures 3 . Subject sign approve write informed consent prior study procedure perform 4 . Subject must agree venipuncture 5 . Subject documented ovarian tumor plan surgical intervention Exclusion Criteria 1 . Women age 18 2 . No planned surgical intervention 3 . Decline phlebotomy 4 . Diagnosis malignancy last 10 year , exception non-melanoma skin cancer</detailed_description>
