Participants follow 6 month interval 24 month follow-up interview determine report use dual method contraception ( behavioral outcome ) . Clinical examination 12 24 month new onset symptom assess biological outcome include incident recurrent case STI unintended pregnancy . Secondary outcome include intermediate outcome variable change stage change , process change , decisional balance , self-efficacy . The primary hypothesis study : 1. Individualized Intervention result increase dual contraceptive use ; 2. Individualized Intervention result protection new case STIs , re-infection sexually transmit organism , unplanned pregnancy ; 3. Individualized Intervention lead great change secondary outcome measure .
