	<brief_summary>This research study test safety investigational drug , ZD6474 , combination 2 drug standard treatment colon rectal cancer ( cetuximab irinotecan ) . ZD6474 block action two substance body : vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . VEGFR stimulate formation new blood vessel . When cancer cell produce VEGFR , new blood vessel make provide blood cancer cell . The blood carry nutrient oxygen , allow cancer cell live grow . EGFR control quickly cell grow multiply . Both substance find normal cell , find much high level cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The main purpose find high dose ZD6474 safe give combination cetuximab irinotecan . We also collect information body respond study drug effect , good bad , treatment colon rectal cancer . - Initially plan add ZD6474 cetuximab alone . Small group participant enrol step . The first group give certain dose ZD6474 cetuximab . If participant manageable side effect , next small group people receive high dose ZD6474 . This increase continue study doctor find high dose give . - Once determine high dose ZD6474 cetuximab , add irinotecan increase dos determine safety three drug combine . The participant know whether receive two three drug combination . - In order confirm safety combine drug understand work interact , participant study take ZD6474 2 week prior start cetuximab and/or irinotecan . - Each cycle treatment 8 week long . All participant start take ZD6474 orally , day one continue take home thereafter . Cetuximab irinotecan give intravenously . Cetuximab give week . Irinotecan give participant enter trial safe dose ZD6474 cetuximab determine . Irinotecan give Day 15 cycle one , every week . - Participants ask visit clinic every week first three week study . After first three week , require visit doctor every week . These visit include physical exam , routine blood test , scan , test procedure monitor health . - In addition routine blood test , blood test research do last 10 subject trial . Test result sample use evaluate participant condition . - In order treat study , tumor tissue specimen must ba available research test . The specimen take biopsy do participant enrol study . - Participants continue study drug long tolerate drug cancer grow .</detailed_description>
