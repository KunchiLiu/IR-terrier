	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib together topotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lapatinib together topotecan work treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer respond cisplatin carboplatin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy lapatinib ditosylate topotecan hydrochloride , term response , patient platinum-resistant refractory ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cavity carcinoma . Secondary - Determine overall survival time patient treated regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Assess toxicity profile regimen patient . Translational - Determine expression pattern epidermal growth factor receptor , HER2/neu , hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha , CD31 , breast cancer resistance protein , topoisomerase I immunohistochemistry use tumor tissue primary debulking surgery . - Determine feasibility monitor circulate tumor cell specific biological marker determine follow response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-28 topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline day 8 course 1 ( immediately topotecan infusion ) evaluate pharmacological study . Tumor tissue sample obtain debulking surgery examine immunohistochemistry epidermal growth factor receptor , HER1 , ErbB1 , HER2/neu , ErbB2 , hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha , CD31 , platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 , topoisomerase I , breast cancer resistance protein . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 39 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
