	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether increase dose sorafenib tosylate increase plasma steady-state concentration patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine whether increase dose drug affect blood pressure patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether variability blood pressure elevation due pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic variability . II . Compare toxicity difference pharmacokinetics deliver high dose drug per day ( use two different schedule ) vs deliver currently recommend dose drug . III . Investigate mechanisms sorafenib tosylate-induced hypophosphatemia serial measurement phosphate metabolism ( long assess 4/29/2009 ) patient , detailed baseline measurement patient , detailed evaluation patient develop grade 3 great hypophosphatemia . IV . Detect subclinical effect drug measure thyroid function . V. Identify biomarkers predict categorization patient response . OUTLINE : This randomize , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-7 day 8 . Patients experience least one grade 2 high toxicity initial sorafenib treatment randomize 1 3 dose-escalated treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive higher-dose oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 15-36 . ARM II : Patients receive standard-dose oral sorafenib tosylate three time daily day 15-36 . ARM III : ( close accrual 4/29/2009 ) Patients receive standard-dose oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 15-36 . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring baseline , day 7 , 14 , 21 , 6 12 month . Blood sample collect periodically throughout study evaluate pharmacokinetic study , thyroid function , serum marker , phosphate metabolism* . CT perfusion image perform baseline , week 6 , week 12 , every 8-12 week thereafter . NOTE : * Phosphate metabolism longer assess 4/29/2009 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week 1 year every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
