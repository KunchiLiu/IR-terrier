	<brief_summary>This epidemiology study design implement hospital-based active surveillance intussusception ( IS ) child &lt; 1 year age low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) -related death among child 29 day 1 year age Mexico . An exist link database `` Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ( IMSS ) '' use . The study describe protocol pilot study , evaluate methodology use later Post-Marketing Surveillance ( PMS ) study . The planned epidemiology study conduct IMSS hospital potentially use IMSS database re-capture potential case IS fatal case source match case control . The purpose project complement data link system active surveillance system IS - order ass feasibility use IMSS data system generate result provide scientific validity . Such comprehensive ( passive active ) surveillance system facilitate post licensure safety profile evaluation vaccine vaccine rotavirus diarrhoea . The Protocol Posting update order comply FDA Amendment Act , Sep 2007 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim pilot study allow implementation active hospital-based surveillance IS child &lt; 1 year age IMSS hospital pediatric medical care , LRTI-related post-neonatal death among child 29 day 1 year age participate IMSS system . Surveillance conduct approximately 230 IMSS hospital pediatric medical care ( tertiary care secondary care hospital ) , 40 million affiliate annual birth cohort 575,000 . During pilot phase completeness validity electronic vaccination demographic data contain IMSS dataset assess determine whether data use actual post licensure study implementation . Study participation database validation include parental/guardian/legal representative interview review vaccination record . Study staff approximately 230 IMSS hospital review medical record daily potential case IS child &lt; 1 year age . Medical record potential IS case review determine eligibility , term IS , base Brighton criterion Parents/guardians/legal representative definite IS case contact study staff recruit child study . After informed consent sign , parental/guardian interview conduct . Additional medical information collect medical record review hospitalization child discharge . A central Information Coordinator ( IMSS staff member ) perform monthly review IMSS database search definite IS case . A cross-check perform IMSS database identify definite IS case yet enrol . In situation , parents/guardians/legal representative contact study staff recruit child study . Either in-hospital interview in-home interview arrange collect data . Study staff perform review LTRI-related death child 29 day 1 year age . They also review morgue record LRTI-related death . A central Information Coordinator ( IMSS staff member ) perform monthly review IMSS database post-neonatal LRTI-related death . Study staff contact parents/guardians/legal representative decease child explain study request enrollment . After informed consent obtain , interview conduct parents/guardians/legal representative . IMSS medical record review study staff . All LTRI relate post-neonatal death report Principal Investigator ( PI ) Safety Review Expert Committee ( SReC ) . The SReC , completely independent GSK Biologicals , assign cause death ( CoD ) enrol LTRI-related post-neonatal death case . All definite IS case LTRI relate post-neonatal fatality report GSK local operating company within 24 hour identification . In addition SAEs , deem related GSK vaccine report base discharged diagnosis . The completeness key demographic data ( date birth , hospital birth , gender , residential address ) assess sample child IMSS dataset single annual birth cohort . A random sample ( N=1,200 ) child single annual birth cohort select IMSS dataset verification demographic data vaccination history ( selection process continue inform consent obtain total 1,200 child ) . In-home interview conduct parents/guardians/legal representative 1200 subject gather demographic vaccination history ( EPI card - Cartilla Nacional de Vacunacion ) . Demographic data collect interview compare IMSS dataset . Vaccine history ( two dos DTP ) collect EPI vaccination card compare IMSS dataset . The agreement DTP assess . All IS episodes single annual birth cohort child IMSS dataset identify . Data necessary selection match control ( date birth , hospital birth , gender ) extract child . Five control identify IS case select IMSS dataset base ability fulfil match criterion . Statistics number match control quality match assess IMSS Rixensart statisticians . Primary outcome measure : occurrence IS passive ( IMSS database ) active ( RDE ) surveillance LRTI-related post-neonatal death passive active surveillance . Secondary outcome measure : demography data IMSS affiliate , IMSS record parent interview ; DTP history IMSS dataset EPI</detailed_description>
