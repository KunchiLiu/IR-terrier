	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Giving vaccine therapy together sargramostim may effective treatment breast cancer ovarian cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect identify best dose vaccine therapy give together sargramostim treat patient stage III-IV breast cancer ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety intradermal administration 3 dose plasmid-based DNA vaccine encode ICD HER2 administer fix dose GM-CSF . II . To determine whether plasmid DNA vaccine encode ICD HER2 elicit HER2 specific immune response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose plasmid-based DNA vaccine effect immunologic response . II . To determine persistence DNA site vaccination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study plasmid-based DNA ( pNGVL3-hICD ) vaccine . Patients receive pNGVL3-hICD vaccine admixed GM-CSF intradermally month 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 15 year primary physician .</detailed_description>
