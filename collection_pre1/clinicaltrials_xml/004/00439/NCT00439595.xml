	<brief_summary>A high proportion child age 5 year pregnant woman Tanzania anaemic , particularly area high malaria transmission . The symptom anaemia often non-specific absent clinical judgement generally insensitive estimate Hb level , especially infant assess basic grade health staff . Thus treatment common cause anaemia available , many case treat due difficulty recognise anaemia . New diagnostic tool increase sensitivity anaemia detection compare clinical diagnosis study demonstrate effectiveness increase case-detection treatment anaemic patient first level healthcare . In addition , cost use relation increase number case treat know knowledge need guide public health decision . Two method measure anaemia currently suitable use first level care ; Copack Haemoglobin colour scale ( HBCS ) Hemocue portable photometry . We propose compare effectiveness basic health facility 2 simple diagnostic tool compare control dispensary ( current practice ) increase rate detection treatment anaemia child age 5 year pregnant woman course 1 year cluster-randomised trial 30 dispensary malaria-endemic area NE Tanzania .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial 2 'Point Care ' Diagnostic Methods Improve Detection Treatment Anaemia African Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study justification In spite number study describe sensitivity specificity various simple test diagnose anaemia ( 19-21 ) study evaluate effectiveness basic train heath worker , use diagnostic tool assure availability anaemia treatment , reduce burden chronic anaemia child pregnant woman malaria endemic area Africa . The cost-effectiveness current diagnostic test know information need guide public health policy . The rate diagnosis , treatment referral basic health facility depend variety factor ( treatment adherence , clinic attendance , health worker awareness , local prevalence anaemia etc ) likely vary different area health facility . A cluster randomise study therefore design shed light issue . Design overview This cluster randomise open label trial 2 different 'point care ' diagnostic tool ( Hemocue Copack ) detect anaemia child age 5 year , compare control arm continue current routine practice ( base clinical judgement ineffective colorimetric method measure haemoglobin ) . An inherent constraint design effectiveness trial absence measure haemoglobin control dispensary . Thus proportion child diagnose anaemia primary outcome expect rate derive roll cross-sectional survey . Children refer next level care track basic data result investigation treatment outcome record . A roll cross-sectional anaemia survey child age 5 year conduct village serve participate health facility throughout trial . Costs anaemia diagnosis treatment assess trial arm cost-effectiveness intervention arm compare control arm diagnose treat anaemia normalise haemoglobin level child anaemia . Social survey ( individual interview focus group discussion ) conduct assess acceptability popularity intervention identify treatement-seeking behaviour risk factor anaemia . The result trial circulate locally nationally soon available order maximise usefulness result health planner provider Tanzania . An exit strategy end trial ensure additional resource provide trial maintain next local health planning resource allocation cycle .</detailed_description>
