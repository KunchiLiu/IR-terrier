	<detailed_description>Bortezomib design block protein play role cell function growth , may cause cancer cell die . ICE combination chemotherapy drug , together , may work effectively cause cancer cell die stop cell divide . Mesna drug protects bladder cell damage chemotherapy drug ifosfamide . It use decrease risk bleed bladder . Before start take drug study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . These test may perform within 28 day start study drug . If exams , test , procedure perform recently , may need repeat . This study doctor decide . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You x-ray bone marrow biopsy check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . You compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen , chest , pelvis positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test within 1 month start therapy study . Because take part study require participant ' ability fight infection normal , blood drawn ( 1-2 tablespoon ) test HIV within 6 month start therapy study . If HIV test result find positive , able take part study . All participant receive bortezomib fix dose , change unless intolerable side effect occur . At start study , 3 participant give dose bortezomib . If dose cause intolerable side effect , dose increase new participant take part study . There total 3 group ( 3-6 participant per group ) enter increase dose level . The dose bortezomib receive depend join study . If find eligible take part study , receive bortezomib plus ICE vein . You receive bortezomib , Days 1 4 , 5 second . The ICE regimen give continuous infusion different time follow . On Day 1 , receive ifosfamide mesna 24 hour . On Day 2 , receive mesna 12 hour carboplatin 1 hour . On Days 1-3 , receive etoposide 2 hour . This schedule bortezomib plus ICE consider 1 cycle ( 2 week ) repeat every 14 day . You may 3-6 cycle study drug , depend tolerance drug status disease . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw week routine test . You study visit start 2-week cycle . During visit , brief questionnaire ask specific side effect might experience . It take 5 minute complete questionnaire . After complete 3 cycle , return CT scan , bone marrow biopsy ( positive disease begin study ) , PET scan check status disease . After complete 3 cycle ( disease worsen intolerable side effect occur ) , may continue study 3 cycle . During Cycles 4-6 , scan blood test mention . After complete study , every 3-4 month indefinite basis , follow-up visit . During visit , blood drawn ( 2-3 tablespoon ) routine test . You also scan performed screen visit . This investigational study . Bortezomib ICE FDA approve commercially available . The combination bortezomib plus ICE consider investigational authorize use research . Up 18 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
