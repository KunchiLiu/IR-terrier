	<brief_summary>This study investigate role brain chemical call serotonin play seizure . Serotonin , present naturally brain , help transmit signal nerve cell . Glucose sugar main fuel brain . Studying two chemical may help explain people epilepsy get seizure likely depress . Healthy volunteer patient 18 60 year age epilepsy without depression whose seizure control medication may eligible study . Candidates screen review medical history , physical examination electroencephalogram ( EEG , brain wave record ) . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan : The first three PET scan measure brain blood flow activity brain serotonin receptor ( part brain cell serotonin attache ) . A second scan measure amount serotonin transport brain cell . A third scan measure glucose use . The PET scanner shape like doughnut . The subject lie bed slide scanner head inside open . A special mask fit subject head help keep still procedure image clear . For first scan , catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein inject radioactive substance artery wrist collect blood sample . The two scan require catheter arm . - Magnetic resonance imaging : This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . The subject lie table slide cylinder . Most scan last 45 90 minute . Subjects wear earplugs muffle loud knocking noise occur scan . - Psychological evaluation : Subjects interview fill questionnaire help study sadness depression epilepsy . - Blood draw : Blood test look difference gene people epilepsy depress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To study serotonergic transmission epilepsy relation cerebral glucose metabolism , mesial temporal sclerosis , depression . Study population : Patients localization-related epilepsy without depression , generalize epilepsy , normal control , age 18-60 . Design : This neuroimaging study use positron emission tomography 5HT ( 1A ) receptor ligand , 18F-FCWAY , serotonin transporter ligand , 11C-DASB , 15O-H2O cerebral blood flow estimation . Patients measurement cerebral glucose metabolism use 18F-FDG well . Magnetic resonance imaging perform examination hippocampal structure partial volume correction . Screening depression perform NIMH investigator . We measure cortisol ACTH level , may affect hippocampal structure function . Testing genetic marker may predict serotonin transporter activity depression perform . Outcome measure : 5HT ( 1A ) receptor binding , serotonin transporter activity , cerebral blood flow , , patient , glucose metabolism hippocampal structure . Patients stratified seizure type depression rating .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must seizures documented appropriate clinical laboratory study . This criterion establish study perform refer physician , preliminary screening NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic , necessary , inpatient videoEEG monitoring . Male Female subject age 18 60 year Healthy control subject also recruit . Subjects must able give write informed consent prior participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients young 18 old 60 year old . There evidence reduce 5HT1A receptor binding patient 60 . Patients know treatable seizure etiology neoplastic infectious disease . Patients MRI finding consistent brain tumor , trauma AVMs . Patients progressive neurologic disorder . Patients history significant medical disorder , require treatment drug stop , would interfere study , except antidepressant . Patients cancer . Patients capable give informed consent . Patients seizure activity 24 hour prior study . Women pregnant nursing Subjects current smoker , stop least two week PET scan , smoking may affect serotonergic neurotransmission . Healthy subject must free personal history seizure disorder Patients coagulation abnormality .</criteria>
