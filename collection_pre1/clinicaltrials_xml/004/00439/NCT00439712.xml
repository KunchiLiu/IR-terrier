	<brief_title>Levocetirizine Treatment Nasal Obstruction Due Perennial Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform accord monocentre , double-blind , placebo control , two arm parallel group design . It divide 3 period : A 7 ± 2 day screen phase patient treat perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) follow 29 ± 4 day treatment period patient administer either levocetirizine 5 mg OD placebo 14 ± 2 week post treatment observation period medication PAR take . However study period patient provide cromoglicine nasal spray eye drop case severe complaint may use rescue medication . Throughout study patient keep diary document severity nasal ocular symptom allergy . Every morning every evening use 4-point scale ( 0 = symptom , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe ) rate nasal obstruction , rhinorrhea , nasal itching , sneeze ocular complaint experience precede 12 hour . Furthermore report adverse event intake drug inclusive rescue ( treatment period ) study medication . Patients attend 5 visit study site . On visit 1 medical history concomitant medication assess patient undergo physical examination , pregnancy test case woman child bear potential , , necessary , skin prick test . Blood take estimate creatinine clearance . Inclusion exclusion criterion check , contradict study continuation , patient enter screen period end morning day visit 2 . If visit morning diary report show sufficiently high nasal obstruction score study participation still comply inclusion exclusion criterion , patient randomize start treatment period take first dose study site . On visit 2 well follow visit adverse event use medication survey compliance check . Visit 3 , 4 5 schedule one week treatment , treatment post treatment observation period end study respectively . On visit 5 final physical examination female childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test . To assess relevant patient nasal obstruction effect study medication nasal obstruction questionnaire complete visit .</detailed_description>
