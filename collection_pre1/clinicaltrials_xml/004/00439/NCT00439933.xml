	<brief_summary>Obesity child adolescent associate morphologic functional change vascular wall , suggest potential role juvenile obesity development atherosclerosis later life . However , evidence intervention study provide far weight loss obese child improve vascular function . Therefore design study include cohort obese child structure weight reduction program order answer question , whether intervention improve vascular function reverse destructive vascular change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic disease rapid increase child adolescent . According National Health Nutrition Examination Surveys , prevalence overweight child double 1976-1980 1999-2002 affect 15 percent child adolescent United States . Further investigation show obese child adolescent high risk persistence overweight adulthood , morbidity mortality high obese adult become overweight childhood , compare whose weight-gain evolve late life . A tremendous increase obesity-related morbidity furthermore immense rise medical cost associate , expect . Growing evidence suggest obesity childhood associate markedly increase prevalence prediabetes diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia cardiovascular risk factor , also predict development coronary artery disease atherosclerotic complication adulthood . A 55-year follow-up study show overweight adolescence lead increase risk morbidity mortality cardiovascular event . This effect even independent adult weight . There evidence , marker early yet reversible state atherosclerosis , decrease flow-mediated dilation brachial artery ( FMD ) increase intima medium thickness ( IMT ) , correlate measure body weight predictive cardiovascular disease . While several study demonstrate weight loss improve metabolic risk factor obese child , data regard effect early vascular disease miss . Therefore design study include cohort obese child structure weight reduction program order answer question , whether intervention improve endothelial cell function reverse increase intima medium thickness . Since intervention program lead body weight reduction severe interference personal lifestyle , feel question need answer intervention program initiate public health basis .</detailed_description>
