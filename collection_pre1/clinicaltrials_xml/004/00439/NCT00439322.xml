	<detailed_description>Background : Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) occur response extreme traumatic stressor . It estimate many 1 million VA patient expose combat may PTSD . VA patient PTSD recently designate �Special Emphasis� population health care resource allocate approximately 14 time allocated patient without chronic , complex , intensive health care need ( i.e. , �Basic Care� group ) . Despite recognition substantial impact upon VA resource , extent mean PTSD affect health health care use remain unclear . This study seek enhance understanding extent mean PTSD affect health health care use patient VA ambulatory care . To meet goal , build ongoing HSR &amp; D project , Veterans Health Study ( VHS ) , prospective longitudinal study 2,425 VA ambulatory care patient . Objectives : Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) often afflict victim traumatic event combat . Growing evidence suggest PTSD related poor health status increase use health care service . However , extent effect mean occur remain unclear . The goal study enhance understand extent mean PTSD affect health health care use patient VA ambulatory care . To meet goal , build HSR &amp; D service-directed project , Veterans Health Study ( VHS ) , prospective longitudinal study 2,425 male VA ambulatory care patient . Methods : This project consist two phase . In Phase 1 , conduct clinical interview ( CAPS ) assess PTSD 474 patient participate VHS 1-year follow-up ( T12 ) . This phase validate brief 17-item self-report PTSD screening measure ( PCL-C ) PTSD clinical interview diagnosis . We use result validation study estimate prevalence PTSD VA primary care , propose use brief measure ( PRIME-MD ) screen PTSD primary care . In Phase 2 , use PCL-C examine impact PTSD health status health care use . We test hypothesis ( ) PTSD direct effect health status independent effect comorbid medical condition , depression , alcohol use , ( b ) control comorbid medical condition , depression alcohol use , PTSD direct effect indirect effect ( health status ) health care utilization . These hypothesis test use structural equation method . If , hypothesize , PTSD exert direct indirect effect health service use , quality care efficiencies health service delivery improved appropriate detection , referral , treatment PTSD among patient VA ambulatory care . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
