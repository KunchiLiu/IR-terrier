	<brief_title>Synchronization Follicle Wave Emergence Ovarian Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample Population Eligible patient undergo IVF ICSI treatment infertility Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center University Saskatchewan ( ARTUS ; Department Obstetrics , Gynecology Reproductive Sciences ) Saskatoon , Saskatchewan Genesis Fertility Centre Vancouver , British Columbia identify study physician nurse . Patients history poor response ovarian stimulation therapy previous IVF ICSI cycle , already decide undergo subsequent treatment cycle , contact study physician offer enrolment study . Patients exhibit inclusion criterion exclusion criterion eligible participate . Inclusion Criteria : - Informed consent obtain - Age 43 year young - 18 &lt; BMI &lt; 35 - History poor response ovarian stimulation determine : - previously cancel oocyte retrieval procedure due &lt; 4 follicle great 12 mm ultrasound OR - &lt; 3 mature oocytes - Physical exam perform within past 12 month - Normal correct level TSH Prolactin within past 12 month - Has take ovarian suppression therapy within 1 month initiate study drug Exclusion Criteria : - Chronic medical condition renal failure - Documented ovarian failure - Presence one ovary - Serum Day 3 FSH &gt; 12 IU/L within past 6 month - Ovaries inaccessible transvaginally - Concomitant glucocorticoid use - Ongoing pregnancy - Any contraindication ovarian stimulation treatment - Participation investigational drug trial 30 day prior pre-study visit Cycle Cancellation Criteria : - The development &lt; 3 follicle &gt; 12 mm . Sample Size A sample size 80 woman ( 40 woman per treatment group ) chosen . This calculation base standard deviation 3.0 treatment group , significance level 0.05 ( 2-tailed test ) , mean difference 2.0 follicle power 80 % . The standard deviation use power calculation base similar study perform domestic animal specie . Approximately 120 IVF/ICSI cycle perform year Department Obstetrics , Gynecology Reproductive Sciences University Saskatchewan approximately 600 cycle perform Genesis Fertility Centre . Approximately 5-10 % patient proven poor responder . Thus , anticipate 75 % recruitment rate , expect recruit 80 patient study 24 month period . It expect 25 % research subject enrol ARTUS Centre 75 % subject enrol Genesis Fertility Centre . Study Procedures Women believe eligible study ask visit Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center University Saskatchewan ( ARTUS ) Genesis Fertility Centre Vancouver , British Columbia pre-study appointment . At visit , inclusion exclusion criterion review . If patient meet study criterion , consent obtain woman randomize either control group ( i.e . treatment start day 4 ) experimental group ( i.e. , treatment start day 1 ) . A medical history vital sign perform . Study drug administration , diary card use potential adverse reaction review pre-study visit . Diary card use monitor study drug administration , adverse reaction , concomitant medication use study . Diary card review patient study personnel throughout duration study . Serious adverse event report investigator drug safety group study drug manufacturer Biomedical Research Ethics Board , accordance Tri-Council Policy guideline . All patient instruct call clinic day 1 menses . If menses begin 6 pm , day consider day 1 . If menses begin 6 pm , next day consider day 1 . Women randomize day 1 treatment group instruct begin ovarian stimulation therapy ( Gonal-f , Serono Canada ) day 1 visit clinic undergo first transvaginal ultrasound examination day 2 . Women randomize day 4 treatment group instruct begin ovarian stimulation day 4 visit clinic day 4 first transvaginal ultrasound examination . Ultrasound examination perform determine number follicle develop ovary . Ultrasound examination continue every 2-4 day woman , per normal standard care . Blood drawn intermittently stimulation determine serum concentration estradiol-17B . Each participant ask perform home urine pregnancy test take first dose study medication . If woman find pregnant , withdrawn study . When follicle &gt; 13 mm detect OR 6 follicle &gt; 10 mm develop E2 &gt; 1000 pmol/L , woman instruct begin take Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Antagonist ( Cetrotide , Serono Canada ) recombinant Luteinizing Hormone ( Luveris , Serono Canada ) . Gonal F , Cetrotide Luveris administration continue daily human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( hCG , Pharmaceutical Partners Canada Inc. ) administer &gt; 3 follicle reach &gt; 17 mm diameter . It anticipate duration ovarian stimulation therapy 8-16 day . Shorter long stimulation interval may result cycle cancellation . Oocytes isolate , evaluate fertilize follow hCG administration , accord normal standard care . The type dose stimulation therapy standardize among woman note Appendix B . Women ask visit clinic follow-up appointment physician study nurse approximately 4 week oocyte retrieval . Adverse event , concomitant medication diary review time . After follow-up appointment , woman complete study-related procedure . Adverse event persist time study completion follow deem medically appropriate . All procedure perform study adhere Good Clinical Practice guideline . The procedure differ carried routine patient care initiation ovarian stimulation therapy day 1 , urine pregnancy test prior initiate therapy completion diary card patient monitor study drug administration , adverse event concomitant medication . Study Endpoints Primary study endpoint include : - number follicle &gt; 15 mm day hCG - peak serum estradiol concentration Secondary study endpoint include : - number antral follicle ( day 1 day 4 ) - number follicle aspirate - number oocyte obtain - oocyte morphology - fertilization rate - number viable embryo ( day 3 day 5 ) - blastocyst rate - number embryo transfer - clinical pregnancy rate ( serum ÃŸ-hCG ) All study endpoint compare woman control versus experimental group . An interim analysis perform study investigator 40 patient complete study procedure . The overall incidence Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) require hospitalization woman undergo IVF/ICSI approximately 3 % . Therefore , 40 normal responder patient would expect incidence OHSS-related hospitalization approximately 1.2 % . If 1 patient treatment group admit hospital OHSS 40 woman complete study procedure , study review possible termination . Foreseeable Risks Discomfort Potential risk study participation include : - discomfort transvaginal ultrasound examination - discomfort bruise site venipuncture - redness , swell discomfort drug injection site - ovarian hyperstimulation In 1-10 % normally-responding patient , ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) occur many follicle develop , place woman risk hospitalization . Because suboptimal number follicle develop woman respond poorly ovarian stimulation therapy , believe risk ovarian hyperstimulation extremely low zero . However , predict outcome initiating therapy day 1 menstrual cycle , guarantee hyperstimulation occur . All above-mentioned risk relate current standard care IVF . The risk OHSS minimize adherence usual standard care ovarian stimulation monitoring . Patients felt risk develop OHSS dose exogenous FSH hCG therapy drop , per usual standard care . In event patient become ill injured result participate study , necessary medical treatment make available additional cost patient . By sign consent form , patient waive legal right . Benefits There guarantee benefit woman participate study . However , hypothesis proven , woman may benefit increased number recruit follicle . We anticipate result study increase understand poor response ovarian stimulation , lead development well treatment couple undergo IVF/ICSI ET future . Costs Partial drug coverage provide Serono Canada Inc. participant study . Confidentiality All participant identify study initial assign patient study number . Only study personnel access study-related record conduct study . The content study relate record available party University Saskatchewan Ethics Board , study sponsor , government regulatory agency unless require law . A report result study may make Health Canada ( HC ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA , USA ) maintain confidentiality patient identification . The result study may also use medical scientific publication patient identity disclose . Study file archive scientific investigator 25 year Royal University Hospital . Voluntary Participation/Withdrawal Study Participation study voluntary . Patients may decide participate may withdraw time . Refusal participate , withdrawal , study affect future medical care patient . Participation study may end time , without patient consent . Reasons may include , limited , patient 's failure follow study instruction , appearance side effect , study cancellation due administrative reason . If &lt; 3 follicle develop diameter 12 mm large , patient withdrawn study IVF/ICSI cycle may cancel .</detailed_description>
