	<brief_title>A Trial GW572016 , Gemcitabine Oxaliplatin Metastatic Pancreaticobiliary Cancer Schema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective phase I study determine safety , tolerability optimal tolerate regimen GW572016 combine gemcitabine combination gemcitabine oxaliplatin . Three six patient treat dose level ass toxicity . To good ass safety final dose level Stage I Stage II , number patient cohort Maximum Tolerated Dose Stages expand 10 . Therefore approximately 34-37 patient treat study . Trial finish data collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients require histologically pathologically confirm , metastatic locally advanced adenocarcinoma pancreas biliary tree No prior systemic chemotherapy locally advance metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer . No prior EGFR inhibitor . ECOG performance status 02 retain ability swallow oral medication Age &gt; 18 , non pregnant . Because dose adverse event data currently available use GW572016 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . The effect GW572016 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female eligible enter participate study : 1 . Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : Has hysterectomy , Has bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) , Has bilateral tubal ligation , Is postmenopausal ( demonstration total cessation menses ³1 year ) . 2 . Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test screening , agree one following : Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) , Vasectomized partner sterile prior female subject 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse two week exposure investigational product , throughout clinical trial , least one week last dose investigational product . Double barrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam , suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm ) Adequate hematologic function : ANC≥1500/ul , platelets≥100,000/ul , hemoglobin 8 Adequate hepatic function total bilirubin ≤ 1.5mg/dL ALT AST ≤ 2x ULN . ( Patients liver metastasis may AST/ALT less equal 5x upper limit normal ) . Patients elevate bilirubin secondary biliary obstruction subsequently stented may enter protocol bilirubin &lt; 2.0 long bilirubin fall . Adequate renal function : ( creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL estimate creatinine clearance great 60ml/min calculate Cockcroft Formula ) . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram MUGA scan . Note baseline treatment scan perform use modality preferably institution . No peripheral neuropathy patient receive oxaliplatin . Life expectancy least 12 week Signed informed consent A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Prior treatment GW572016 EGFR target therapy . Prior treatment systemic chemotherapy metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer . Evidence brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known contraindication use oxaliplatin gemcitabine . History allergy platinum compound patient receive oxaliplatin . Amendment # 2 4/28/05 The subject know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate study drug . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction GW572016 Participation investigational study within 28 day prior study enrolment Any major surgery ( insertion vascular access device consider major surgery ) , hormonal therapy ( replacement ) , chemotherapy radiotherapy within last 4 week and/or recover prior therapy within last 4 week and/or recover prior therapy . Pregnant lactating female exclude study GW572016 member 4anilinoquinazoline class kinase inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother GW572016 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated GW572016 . Malabsorption syndrome disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function major resection stomach small bowel could affect absorption GW572016 . Any unresolved bowel obstruction . The patient inadequate venous access clinical judgment investigator designate clinical staff . The patient take medication prohibit medication list Section 10.2 Patients require oral anticoagulant ( coumadin , warfarin ) eligible provide increased vigilance respect monitoring INR . If medically appropriate treatment available , investigator may also consider switch patient LMW heparin , interaction GW572016 expect . Patients may receive investigational agent receive concurrent anticancer therapy .</criteria>
