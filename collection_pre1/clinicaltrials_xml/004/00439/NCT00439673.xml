	<detailed_description>Myelodisplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) heterogeneous group diseases characterize ineffective hematopoiesis ( result increase apoptosis precursor cell ) , progressive peripheral cytopenia , tendency evolve acute leukemia . The term `` syndrome '' represent wide clinical spectrum group diseases , range mild stable cytopenia , low risk leukemic conversion life expectancy several year , true pre-leukemia . The International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop recently develop consensus risk-based International Prognostic Score System ( IPSS ) primary MDS , markedly improve prognostic stratification MDS patient . Following IPSS , possible identify patient ( i.e . Hig-Risk Intermediate-2-Risk patient ) bad prognosis ( i.e . life-expectancy &lt; 1 year ) due high risk leukemic evolution . Currently , allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent curative therapy subgroup high-risk patient . However , therapeutic option often preclude several reason ( old age , comorbidity , lack suitable donor ) . Among experimental treatment hitherto test , 5-Azacitidine ( 5-Aza ) recently show promising result . Moreover , biological experimental data suggest association 5-Aza histone deacetylase inhibitor , Valproic Acid , differentiate agent , retinoic acid , might synergistic . Azacitidine ( Aza C ) , pyrimidine nucleoside analog , develop antitumor agent . In addition cytotoxic effect , induces differentiation malignant cell vitro . Aza C inhibit DNA methyltransferase , enzyme mammalian cell responsible methylating newly synthesize DNA , result synthesis hypomethylated DNA change gene transcription expression . The mechanism Aza C produce effect likely multifactorial . Aza C produce significant myelosuppression , particularly high dos . Aza C could also act biologic response modifier . The response hematopoietic progenitor cytokine impair patient MDS . This may attributable part abnormality signal transduction pathway downstream cytokine receptor . In vitro data suggest Aza-C modulate cytokine signal transduction pathway , render sensitive unresponsive cell effect cytokine , partially restore normal hematopoietic regulation . Incorporation Aza-C DNA inhibit DNA methyltransferase induces DNA hypomethylation . 5-Azacytidine 5-Aza-2_-deoxycytidine ( decitabine ) , 2 potent inhibitor cytosine methylation , show strong antileukemic activity acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . In addition , induce trilineage response myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) dose level allow outpatient management , moderate myelotoxicity significant nonhematologic toxicity . Azacytidine drug approve FDA treatment MDS . The median survival patient MDS Intermediate/high IPSS score , treat conventional care regimen , assume 11 month . Patients treat Azacytidine CALGB 9221 trial median survival 18 month . Responses occur 60 % patient Aza C arm ( 7 % complete response , 16 % partial response , 37 % improve ) compare 5 % ( improve ) receive supportive care ( P &lt; .001 ) . Median time leukemic transformation death 21 month Aza C versus 13 month supportive care ( P =.007 ) . Transformation acute myelogenous leukemia occur first event 15 % patient Aza C arm 38 % receive supportive care ( P =.001 ) . Furthermore , Aza-C improve quality life , compare supportive care . The oppose action histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) allow gene expression exquisitely regulate chromatin remodelling . Aberrant transcription due alter expression mutation gene encode HATs , HDACs bind partner , key event onset progression cancer . HDAC inhibitor reactivate gene expression inhibit growth survival tumour cell . The remarkable tumour specificity compound , potency vitro vivo , underscore potential HDAC inhibitor excite new agent treatment cancer . Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor show potent inducer growth arrest , differentiation , and/or apoptotic cell death transform cell vitro vivo . One class HDAC inhibitor , hydroxamic acid-based hybrid polar compound ( HPCs ) , induce differentiation micromolar low concentration . Studies ( x-ray crystallographic ) show catalytic site HDAC tubular structure zinc atom base HDAC inhibitor , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) trichostatin A , fit structure hydroxamic moiety inhibitor bind zinc . HDAC inhibitor cause acetylate histone accumulate tumor normal tissue , accumulation use marker biologic activity HDAC inhibitor . Hydroxamic acid-based HPCs act selectively inhibit tumor cell growth level little toxicity normal cell . These compound also act selectively gene expression , alter expression 2 % gene express cultured tumor cell . In general , chromatin fraction enrich actively transcribe gene also enrich highly acetylate core histone , whereas silent gene associate nucleosomes low level acetylation . However , HDACs also acetylate protein histone nucleosomes . The role target play induction cell growth arrest , differentiation , and/or apoptotic cell death determine . Our work hypothesis inhibition HDAC activity lead modulation expression specific set gene , control disrupt ectopic expression EVI1 similar oncogene , , turn , result growth arrest , differentiation , and/or apoptotic cell death . The hydroxamic acid-based HPCs potentially effective agent cancer therapy , possibly , cancer chemoprevention . Valproic acid Valproic acid ( VPA , 2-propylpentanoic acid ) establish drug long-term therapy epilepsy . During past year , become evident VPA also associate anti-cancer activity . VPA suppress tumor growth metastasis , also induce tumor differentiation vitro vivo . Several mode action might relevant biological activity VPA : ( 1 ) VPA increase DNA bind activate protein-1 ( AP-1 ) transcription factor , expression gene regulate extracellular-regulated kinase ( ERK ) -AP-1 pathway ; ( 2 ) VPA downregulates protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity ; ( 3 ) VPA inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , negative regulator Wnt signal pathway ; ( 4 ) VPA activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma dagger ( Rif . 25 ) ; ( 5 ) VPA block HDAC ( histone deacetylase ) , cause hyperacetylation . The finding elucidate important role VPA cancer therapy . VPA might also useful low toxicity agent give long time period chemo prevention and/or control residual minimal disease . Authors show well-tolerated antiepileptic drug valproic acid powerful HDAC inhibitor . Valproic acid relief HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression cause hyperacetylation histone culture cell vivo . Valproic acid inhibits HDAC activity vitro , probably bind catalytic center HDACs . Most importantly , valproic acid induces differentiation carcinoma cell , transform hematopoietic progenitor cell leukemic blast acute myeloid leukemia patient . More , tumor growth metastasis formation significantly reduce animal experiment . Therefore , valproic acid might serve effective drug cancer therapy . These finding constitute `` proof concept '' use valproic acid therapy acute leukemia myelodisplastic syndrome . ATRA Retinoids show major role treatment APL . There also vitro evidence primary blast cell FAB group M3 demonstrate phenotypic evidence maturation expose retinoid without agent . Additional relevant information AML/MDS come number source : ( I ) The addition retinoid increase sensitivity AML blast Ara C vitro . ( II ) BCL 2 protein over-expressed proportion AML case . There evidence correlate treatment response survival , since chemotherapy result apoptotic cell death , may constitute mechanism chemo-resistance . Retinoids regulate BCL 2 expression AML blast vitro . The increased sensitivity AML blast chemotherapy mention , mediate retinoid , due shorten BCL 2 half-life . ( III ) In pilot study Tallman et al , 39 high risk patient median age 65 year , ( n=25 ) fail respond chemotherapy , treat ATRA ( 150 mg/m2 ) LD Ara C. Forty-two percent patient achieve CR ( 25 % ) PR ( 17 % ) 17 % stable disease . ( IV ) In recent study M.D . Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , 170 patient median age 66 year AML high risk MDS randomize receive FAI ( fludarabine , Ara C idarubicin ) alone , FAI combine either G CSF ATRA . The overall 6 month survival 49 % . In comparison ATRA-treated versus ATRA-non-treated patient , favourable outcome recipient retinoids , CR rate 56 % vs 42 % respectively ( p=0.06 ) superior 6 month survival event free survival ( p=0.02 ) long-term benefit demonstrable . In study exposure retinoid relatively short , namely day -2 day +8 chemotherapy ( Rif . 30 ) . ( V ) In recent study Dusseldorf , 18 patient MDS AML secondary MDS treat Valproic Acid ( VPA ) alone , 5 patient receive combination VPA ATRA . A favourable response observe 44 % patient treated VPA alone , median response duration 4 ( 3-9 ) month . Four five patient subsequently relapse treat VPA + ATRA , two responding . The Authors hypotize pre-treatment VPA might necessary synergistic effect drug . The evidence suggest retinoids may useful biological response modifier ( combine chemotherapy and/or VPA ) little additional toxicity . Their role therefore examine trial , association 5-Azacytidine Valproic Acid .</detailed_description>
