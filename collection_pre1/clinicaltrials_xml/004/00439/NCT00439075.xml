	<brief_title>OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CPAP STUDY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema frequent medical emergency . Several study show continuous positive airway pressure effective acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema , improvement gas exchange , reduction intubation rate trend towards reduce mortality . CPAP usually obtain hermetic nasal facemask witch expiratory valve maintain positive pressure end expiration . With support , patient receive assistance respiration . The available data CPAP concern patient hospitalise cardiology intensive care unit , resuscitation area emergency department . We undertake controlled prospective randomise trial investigate whether early use CPAP would improve oxygenation survival , compare standard medical therapy patient acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema . This study include 124 patient 18 year age , suffer acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema , respiratory rate great 25 bpm oxygen saturation le 90 % . The patient include begin episode , prehospital mobile intensive car unit ( SAMU ) admit resuscitation area central hospital . They randomly assign CPAP conventional oxygen therapy . The randomisation sequence generate random number table . Closed envelope contain allocate treatment store emergency department open patient include . Oxygen saturation ( pulse-oxymetry ) , heart rate , respiratory rate , dyspnea , blood pressure measure every 15 min transport intensive care unit every hour . The blood gaze measure arrival . The intubation rate , duration hospitalisation mortality thirty day follow initial treatment note .</detailed_description>
