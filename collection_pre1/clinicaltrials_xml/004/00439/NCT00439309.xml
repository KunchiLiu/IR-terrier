	<brief_summary>To evaluate new vascular sealant compare control control suture line bleed vascular reconstructive surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety &amp; Effectiveness Vascular Sealant System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular surgery encompasses wide range surgical procedure . In procedure reduction blood loss creation suture line utmost importance surgeon . Bleeding suture line may require transfusion , well prolonged operative anesthesia time . Suture hole bleed common follow use synthetic biological graft vascular repair . Several topical hemostatic an seal agent develop control suture line bleeding . This new vascular sealant posse high bonding property , minimal tissue reaction , biodegradable absorb body quickly . The primary focus study compare safety effectiveness vascular sealant standard care method use today , specifically gelfoam/thrombin sponge like material .</detailed_description>
