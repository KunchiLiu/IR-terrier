	<detailed_description>Influenza A viruses potential cause worldwide epidemic and/or pandemic result significant morbidity mortality . Two-hundred twenty-six healthy male female subject age 18 49 year , inclusive , United States ( US ) enrol single-center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial intradermal ( ID ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection subvirion ( SV ) inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine . The study two vaccine group . Vaccine group 1 : subject receive 0.1 mL H5 Hemagglutination ( HA ) ID route one arm 0.1 mL saline placebo IM route arm . Vaccine group 2 : subject receive 0.1 mL H5 HA IM route one arm 0.1 mL saline placebo ID route arm . All eligible subject enrol randomized 1:1 ( 113 subject per vaccine group ) either vaccine group 1 vaccine group 2 . All subject receive two dos approximately 30micrograms H5 HA assign route , either IM ID , separate approximately 28 day . At vaccination visit , subject also receive saline placebo opposite arm different route vaccine route ( i.e . vaccine administer ID route one arm , saline placebo administer IM route opposite arm ) . The second vaccine dose administer route per vaccine group assign original randomization . Subjects observed clinic approximately 15 minute vaccination . Subjects return Day 2 arm check assessment adverse event . All subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature , systemic local adverse event 7 day vaccination . They return clinic Day 8 adverse event ( AE ) assessment , concomitant medication assessment , target physical exam ( indicate ) , review memory aid . AE data capture Day 0 Day 56 . Serious AE data capture Day 0 end subject 's participation study ( approximately 7 month ) . The subject , staff assess subject , lab personnel blind . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination , Day 0 ; prior second vaccination , Day 28 ; Day 56 approximately Day 208 ( 7months dose 1 ) . The primary objective compare immunogenicity similar dosage level subvirion inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine give ID IM injection one month receipt second dose vaccine compare safety reactogenicity ID IM immunization similar dosage level subvirion inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine among healthy young adult . The secondary objective evaluate serum antibody responses approximately 1 7 month first vaccination .
