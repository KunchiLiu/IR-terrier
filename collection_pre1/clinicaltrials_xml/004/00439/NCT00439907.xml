	<detailed_description>Rupture external anal sphincter occur 4 % percent deliveries department . It clear study whether result concern anal function well overlap repair end-to-end repair injured muscle . Our routine perform end-to-end repair , though anal surgeon , set secondary repair , prefer overlap method . Former study , repair perform highly skilled operator , indicate overlap method well . We want compare two method RCT end-points examination result one year address endoanal sonography finding , anal manometric result continence score evaluate Weksner score questionnaire . Our study perform routine clinical setting . The patient recruit study delivery injury recognize . When give inform consent randomize one two operation method . The operation perform consultant obstetrician call resident supervise consultant . The proctologist perform anal manometry sonography one year blind surgical method . We plan include approximately 160 patient one center . In center 4500 delivery per year .</detailed_description>
