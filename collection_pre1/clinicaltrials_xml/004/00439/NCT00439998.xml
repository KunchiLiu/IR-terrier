	<brief_summary>The efficacy epidural depend mainly accurate placement catheter epidural space . Therefore , identification epidural space vital part procedure . Obese patient represent challenge group identification anatomical landmark . With use ultrasound , visualize image anatomical structure back . Some anesthesiologist believe ultrasound help placement epidural , routinely use assist determine needle entry point back well estimate depth epidural space find . Our hypothesis use lumbar spine ultrasound image accurately determine epidural space depth epidural insertion point obese patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Imaging For Facilitating Labour Epidurals Obese Parturients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent technical advance , especially evolution ultrasound technology , help extent circumvent limitation epidural anesthesia . The efficacy epidural depend mainly accurate placement catheter epidural space . Therefore , identification epidural space vital part procedure . Obese patient represent challenge group identification anatomical landmark , important determine ultrasound image useful technique population . All patient undergo ultrasound image lumbar spine epidural insertion . Ultrasound image perform one investigator . A different anesthesiologist perform epidural procedure base US information provide investigator . The investigator provide information epidural performer insertion point , angle needle insertion safe approximate distance reach epidural space facilitate epidural performance . To maintain blinding prevent performer bias , exact depth epidural space skin , see ultrasound disclose . The investigator , aid in-built caliper , measure distance later time save image . The result study expect determine clinical reliability ultrasound image visualize anatomical structure relevant technical performance epidural analgesia obese population . Since technical difficulty perform epidural commonly encounter obese patient , ultrasound visualization would improve overall success technique predict depth epidural needle insert . In turn , complication rate would minimize .</detailed_description>
