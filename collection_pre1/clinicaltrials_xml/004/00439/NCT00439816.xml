	<brief_title>Veteran Preference For Group Visits Its Effect Hypertension Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design : Randomized clinical trial ass veterans� preference group visit effect group visit hypertension outcome . Hypertension affect close 50 million person U.S. , prevalence , severity , impact increase non-white Americans 1.Despite recent clinical trial associate successful antihypertensive therapy reduction stroke incidence , myocardial infarction , heart failure , control rate remain Healthy People 2010 goal 50 % . The importance blood pressure control recognize within VA two condition select QUERI include ischemic heart disease congestive heart disease , blood pressure control performance measure every VAMC 2 . Clinical trial show blood pressure control achieve patient hypertension 3 . When physician fail prescribe lifestyle modification , adequate dos antihypertensive medication , appropriate drug , blood pressure control may achieved.1 In course 15-30 minute visit primary care physician , lifestyle modification may address inertia may prevent rapid adjustment medication dosage change drug combination . 4 . The outpatient group visit model intervention develop manage care organization capitalize economy scale . It significant point departure exist health care delivery system design , focus acute care . The outpatient group visit model also foster collaborative effort physician patient , introduces nurse knowledgeable team member trust communicate important information patient patient physician , promotes peer support among participate patient . Group visit proven successful high health service utilize elderly patient one chronic illness . A one-year study monthly 2-hour group visit lead physician nurse show significant improvement care delivery measure decrease emergency room visit , specialty care visit , hospital readmission though change self-reported health functional status realize . 5 . Also , patient type 2 diabetes attend group visit show increase quality life measure , knowledge type 2 diabetes , improve metabolic control compare patient usual care . 6 . Group visit offer provider time per visit address process-of-care indicator provide patient time per visit primary care physician . The monthly schedule allow frequent contact patient physician . Providers care patient group deliver consistent message multiple patient . Though monthly primary care visit ( group ) would increase 4 primary care visit per year presently realize veteran hypertension Ralph H. Johnson VAMC , frequency consistent JNC 7 guideline monthly visit follow-up monitoring initiation antihypertensive therapy . Presently , average primary care physician Charleston VA schedule see 2 patient per hour . Group visit would allow physician see 20 patient 2 hour . While demonstrate feasible acceptable elderly , chronically ill manage care population , uninsured underinsured patient type 2 diabetes , group visit systematically test Veteran�s Health Administration system . Additionally , previous study evaluate patients� acceptance group visit response group accord race/ethnicity . This study seek inform whether group visit acceptable veteran method health care delivery , regardless race/ethnicity . Methods : The study assess effect group visit hypertension outcome . Veterans stage 2 hypertension ( systolic blood pressure =160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure =100 mmHg ) identify routine office visit . The primary care physician explain group visit use standard script patient ask willing see group set . Patients indicate willingness receive care group set randomly assign either group visit usual care . Randomization occur block insure equal number subject race/ethnicity two group ( group set vs. usual care ) . We recruit 8 VA primary care physician participate study . Several already indicate interest conduct group visit . Patient Visit Protocol : Group visit co-led patients� primary care internal medicine physician clinic nurse . Each group visit session schedule two hour consist : 15 minute `` warm-up '' socialization , 30 minute presentation health- relate topic ( facilitated physician another team member special expertise ) , 15 minute break , time nurse physician circulate , attend individual need , immunization , appointment scheduling , issue , 15 minute question answer , 15 minute plan next session , 30 minute one-on-one consultation physician . Upon conclusion group portion visit , patient opportunity see physician individually require . While group visit intend main source medical care , patient need care schedule group visit , specific medical need accommodate group visit ( i.e . PAP smear , DRE ) , able schedule one-on-one visit primary care provider .</detailed_description>
