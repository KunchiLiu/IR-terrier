	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness new drug call lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) relapse initial treatment . Patients 21 year age old CLL SLL previously receive standard treatment may eligible study . Participants take lenalidomide capsule day 21 day , follow 21 day drug . This constitute one treatment cycle . Treatment continue four cycle long medicine tolerate . After four cycle , patient respond completely continue treatment another two cycle ; patient respond partially continue treatment another four cycle ; patient respond stop treatment continue follow safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There evidence lenalidomide single agent activity chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic leukemia ( SLL ) . Optimal dose lenalidomide CLL establish yet . A pilot clinical trial CLL study single agent lenalidomide cycle every 4 week 25 mg three week one week drug . In trial dose reduction necessary secondary prolong neutropenia thrombocytopenia majority patient . However , also remarkable efficacy evidence immune stimulatory effect lenalidomide . Therefore , propose phase II trial use 20 mg lenalidomide ( Revlimid ( Registered Trademark ) ) 3 week 3 week 4 cycle subject previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic leukemia ( SLL ) . Subjects least partial response ( PR ) may go receive 4 additional cycle . The primary objective trial test efficacy tolerable dose scheme lenalidomide .</detailed_description>
