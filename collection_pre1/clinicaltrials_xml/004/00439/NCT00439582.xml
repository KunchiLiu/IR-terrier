	<brief_summary>Background : Detrimental effect consumption industrial trans fatty acid ( TFA ) partially hydrogenate vegetable oil ( PHVO ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor well document . However , little information available effect natural source TFA come milk fat , dairy product ruminant meat . In fact , due naturally low level TFA milk fat , almost impossible conduct clinical trial limit number subject . Methodology : To compare effect industrial natural dietary source TFA , two specific test fat design produce . A substantial amount milk fat ( 130 kg ) enrich TFA produce modification cow 's diet selection cow high TFA content . The level obtain approximately 4- 7-fold high typically present milk fat ( - 20 instead 3-6 g/100 g total fatty acid ) . The control fat compose PHVO balance saturate fatty acid ( lauric , myristic palmitic ) . Both experimental fat contain 20-22 % monounsaturated TFA volunteer ' daily experimental fat intake ( 54 g ) , represent 12.0 g/day TFA 5.4 % daily energy ( base 2000 kcal/day ) . These two test fat incorporate food item provide 46 healthy subject randomise , double blind , control , cross-over design . The primary outcome high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , independent risk factor CVD . Other parameter lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDL-C ) , HDL-C level subclass also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This double blind , control , randomise , cross-over , single center clinical trial . Product ( ) test : Food item ( butter , cheese biscuit ) manufacture use ( ) experimental milk fat ( ii ) mixture vegetable oil ( include partially hydrogenate oil ) , use control . Both fat balance trans fatty acid content saturate fatty acid content . The main difference two experimental fat ( milk fat control fat ) distribution trans fatty acid ( TFA ) . The experimental milk fat , entitle `` vaccenic acid enrich milk fat '' ( VAMF ) , obtain feeding cow diet contain sunflower oil . The distribution ( quality ) monounsaturated C18:1 TFA VAMF therefore close usual milk fat , high level ( enrich milk ) .The experimental control fat , short CTRL , obtain mix partially hydrogenate vegetable oil ( PHVO ) vegetable oil fat . Amount , dosage , route administration , duration treatment : During 1-week run-in period , subject eat daily product experimental one ( butter , cheese biscuit ) manufacture use usual milk collect France . The subject eat daily 3 week butter , cheese biscuit contain one 2 experimental fat ( milk fat control fat , cross-over 1-week wash-out period ) eat daily 54 g experimental fat , contain 20-22 % TFA . The total study duration subject 8 week : 1-week run-in period , 3-week experimental fat diet cross-over 1-week wash-out period experimental period . All measurement blood sampling do first day week 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 8 . Primary outcome : HDL-Cholesterol ( HDL-C ) level Secondary outcome : - Triglycerides , total cholesterol , Apo A1 , Apo B , factor VII factor VIIa , fibrinogen level . Lp ( ) CETP , measure plasma fluorimetry . LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) calculate - LDL , HDL VLDL level subclasses Other outcome : evaluation fatty acid profile plasma cholesteryl ester phospholipid</detailed_description>
