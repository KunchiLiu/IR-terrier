	<brief_title>Immediate Versus Deferred Androgen Deprivation Therapy , Goserelin Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent prostate cancer radical radiation therapy common problem often long interval biochemical failure time symptomatic relapse . Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) commonly use intervention follow radiation failure currently often start immediately recognition biochemical failure absence symptom . ADT associate side effect impact quality life . It unclear whether ADT reduce prostate-specific mortality . There currently insufficient evidence time ADT respect prevention prostate cancer death quality life cost particularly men fast slow prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) double time . The general objective ELAAT trial determine optimal time ADT men recurrent prostate cancer radical radiotherapy . Consenting patient undergone prior radical radiotherapy prostate cancer experience recurrence screen eligibility . If determine eligible , patient stratify accord PSA doubling time , pre-radiation Gleason Score , previous radical prostatectomy clinical centre . After stratification , patient randomize immediate versus defer ADT base 1:1 ratio two arm . Patients follow indefinitely assess formally 6 month interval date randomization . Patients assessed recurrent disease ( biochemical failure ) , new primary cancer , complication advance malignancy , quality life overall survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Males 18 year age histological confirmation adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Biochemical progression radical radiotherapy total prostate dose &gt; 52 Gy . In patient without previous radical prostatectomy , biochemical progression define PSA range nadir + 2 ng/mL ( Phoenix definition ) ≤ 6 ng/mL ( PSA must within 30 day randomization ) . In patient previous radical prostatectomy , biochemical progression define rise PSA ( least 2 value ) range 0.4 ng/mL ≤ 3 ng/mL ( recent PSA must within 30 day randomization ) . 1 . Patients within 4 year brachytherapy implantation date . 2 . Patients medical condition goserelin bicalutamide contraindicate opinion supervise oncologist urologist . 3 . Patients another active malignancy malignancy treatment within 5 year ( basal squamous cell skin cancer exclude trial ) . 4 . Patients geographic inaccessibility preclude necessary followup . 5 . Failure provide write informed consent .</criteria>
