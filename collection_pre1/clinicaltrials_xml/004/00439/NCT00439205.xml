	<detailed_description>Fluorescence Reflectance : All tissue cell make tiny particle give small amount light . This light call fluorescence . Cancerous cell normal cell give different amount type fluorescence also reflect ( bounce back ) light differently . Researchers want good understand fluorescence reflectance mouth tissue use tell cell abnormal . This information may help doctor detect early mouth cancer treat area affect cancerous change . The MDM Instrument , FastEEM4 Instrument , POS Instrument , PS2 Instrument , IMS Instrument : Five ( 5 ) instrument develop : - multispectral digital microscope ( MDM ) , microscope allow fluorescence reflectance collect ; - FastEEM4 , shine different color light mucosa ( line mouth ) , allow fluorescence reflectance collect look without surgically remove tissue ; - portable optical spectroscopy ( POS ) instrument , small , portable version FastEEM4 device ; - portable screening system ( PS2 ) , take image measurement reflectance fluorescence mode ; - image mapping spectrometer ( IMS ) , PS2 POS combine . The MDM system modify standard medical microscope similar doctor use examine people 's ear . A special light source attach microscope provide different color light shine mouth . This microscope also digital camera attach researcher take picture fluorescence reflectance mouth order record see different light color . Researchers want study picture order well understand difference fluorescence reflectance normal abnormal cell . The PS2 imaging device examine mouth without touch mouth . The PS2 use blue light source fluorescence mode . The light pass filter shine tissue area . A filter place path collect fluorescent light give tissue . In reflectance mode , white light use . Images collect use device laptop software interface . A set fluorescence reflectance image take less minute . The IMS also image device examine mouth without touch mouth . The IMS include white blue light , camera lens , customize optic ( mirror , prism , lenses ) , filter , camera , computer . In reflectance mode , white light shine tissue area , specialized optic put data camera . In fluorescence mode , blue light highlight tissue . A filter block blue light , allow tissue fluorescence see . The IMS use light source PS2 . The FastEEM4 system ( nonstandard image technology ) probe ( small device use measure and/or detect ) size pencil . The probe place gently mucosa , different color light directed probe small area ( lesion normal-appearing area ) mouth tissue . Then fluorescence reflectance record computer . The POS instrument direct different color light fiber line mouth light collect sent special camera computer analyze . The spectroscopy system small probe size write pen place gently line mouth . The exposed tissue give small amount fluorescence . This light see eye , see computer . Use MDM , PS2 , IMS Instruments : If agree take part study , clinician may first use MDM , PS2 , IMSsystem . If one system use , clinician examine inside mouth gloved finger use standard white light one image system view . The instrument take picture abnormal-appearing normal-appearing area mouth . The edge area mark surgical pen outline border abnormal-appearing tissue normal-appearing tissue see digital photo . Imaging device take 2 minute less . Between use instrument , sterilize accord standard practice . Use FastEEM4 and/or POS Instruments : The clinician may use FastEEM4 and/or POS system . If FastEEM4 and/or POS system use , FastEEM4 and/or POS probe ( ) place gently mouth lesion ( ) . Several measurement take move probe ( ) short distance time , toward edge lesion ( ) , measure appear normal mouth tissue . Biopsies Tissue Removal : You may surgery remove abnormal-appearing mouth lesion part standard care , study biopsy tissue removal may do time surgery . After surgeon finish surgery remove tissue mouth part standard treatment , portion tissue ( abnormal-appearing normal-appearing area ) already remove surgeon may separate main tissue specimen separately evaluate . This do researcher well compare appearance diagnosis sit image take . In addition , biopsy may take area normal-appearing tissue opposite side mouth image FastEEM4 and/or POS probe ( ) , FastEEM4 and/or POS system ( ) use . If perform , one biopsy normal appear tissue addition remove standard care . If biopsy perform , small sample ( 4 mm , size small pencil eraser ) line mouth remove , asleep general anesthesia , area normal-appearing tissue opposite side mouth image instrument . Length Study : You tell experimental finding study . Information diagnosis available treat doctor . After tissue collection complete , participation study . All data ( tissue image pathologic diagnosis ) cod number instead personal identifying information ( name medical record number ) help ensure privacy . This investigational study . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
