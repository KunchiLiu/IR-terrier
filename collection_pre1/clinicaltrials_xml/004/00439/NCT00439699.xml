	<brief_title>A Pilot Clinical Trial Of Memantine Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Essential tremor ( ET ) common movement disorder relatively effective tolerated therapy . Tremor ET believe generated central oscillator , inferior olivary nucleus . Membrane potential neuron nucleus oscillate tremor frequency . Evidence indicate ability nucleus produce tremor medicate glutamate act NMDA receptor . As NMDA receptor antagonists suppress tremor , suggest memantine , low affinity NMDA antagonist , effective essential tremor . Objective : To assess efficacy , safety stability response memantine pilot single-site feasibility rising-dose trial treatment essential tremor . Method : Subjects bilateral upper extremity essential tremor , essential tremor therapy , stable-dose therapy , laboratory test EKG test screen visit . Eligible subject baseline tremor assessment standardize rating scale . The tremor videotape . In first titration step , subject take memantine dose 5 mg/day 2 week , 5 mg twice day another 2 week , tremor assess . In second titration step dose similarly raise 20 mg/day , take 10 mg twice day , tremor assess 4 week last tremor assessment . In third titration step , dose raise 30 mg/day , take 15 mg twice day , tremor assess conclusion third titration step . In fourth titration step , dose raise 40 mg/day , take 20 mg twice day , tremor assess conclusion fourth titration step . The dose adjust downwards titration tolerate . Subjects achieve clinically meaningful tremor reduction enter 12-week extension study assess stability tremor response . Data analysis : Subjects recruit accord two-part Gehan design . A `` responder '' define 30 % reduction tremor score . To assess whether memantine potential responder rate 30 percent , 9 subject recruit first phase . If least one subject responder , another 16 subject recruited estimate actual responder rate standard error 10 % . Conclusions : If memantine effective suppressing tremor , would welcome patient movement disorder community well-tolerated new treatment essential tremor .</detailed_description>
