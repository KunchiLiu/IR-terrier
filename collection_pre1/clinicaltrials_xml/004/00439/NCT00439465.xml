	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether administration highly effective `` killer '' cell ( cytotoxic T cell ) , along IL-2 GM-CSF immediately follow Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation ( APBSCT ) enhance anti-tumor immune reconstitution improve outcome Multiple Myeloma patient . The overall hypothesis proposal immediately follow APBSCT immune reconstitution optimal administer `` killer '' cell , combine administration IL-2 GM-CSF .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Multiple Myeloma : Patients must meet criterion diagnosis Multiple Myeloma . Patient must meet either criterion list : Stage I , II , III newly diagnose multiple myeloma Progressive relapse disease PR CR Primary refractory disease . Relapsed refractory disease . Patients may receive prior autologous transplant . The patient must recover serious life threaten effect previous treatment time study entry ( unless abnormality believe due underlie myeloma ) . The patient must adequate bone marrow function , i.e . total WBC &gt; 2,000/ul , Hgb &gt; 7 gm/dl , platelet count &gt; 50,000/ul , unless abnormality believe due underlie myeloma . The patient must adequate liver function , i.e . bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , SGOT , SGPT great 2 time upper normal limit ( unless abnormality believe due underlie myeloma ) . The patient must adequate renal function , i.e . serum creatinine &lt; 3.0 mg/dl , and/or creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min . This eligibility criterion exclude renal insufficiency believe secondary myeloma . Age &gt; 18 year &lt; 75 year old The patient must Karnofsky status &gt; 80 % Patients must life expectancy least 12 week Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 45 % radionuclide scan echocardiography Pulmonary function test : force vital capacity , DLCO FEV1 must &gt; 50 % predict No significant comorbid medical psychiatric illness would significantly compromise patient 's clinical care chance survival . Informed write consent must obtain . Patients must able give informed consent prerequisite procedure . The Informed Consent form become part his/her permanent record copy give patient Medical , social , psychological factor would prevent patient receive cooperate full course therapy . Evidence physical exam , LP , CT , MRI scan CNS involvement malignancy Any clinically significant cardiac disease ( angina , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia require therapy ) clinically significant obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease Serology positive HIV HTLVI Active hepatitis B C History seizures Concurrent expect need therapy corticosteroid Active connective tissue disease Current `` clinically significant '' pleural effusion , pericardial effusion , ascites Positive pregnancy test presence lactation Collection few 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ( peripheral blood stem cell ) . If apheresis collection inadequate base criterion , patient remove protocol marrow harvest may perform A history second malignancy ( squamous cell/ basal cell carcinoma skin cervical dysplasia ) must review Principal Investigator , inclusion exclusion study . Based upon PI 's review , patient may eligible ( i.e. , distant past history malignancy )</criteria>
