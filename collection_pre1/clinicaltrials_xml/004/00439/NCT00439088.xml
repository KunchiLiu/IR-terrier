	<brief_title>Try Walking Mile These Shoes : Activity Level Lower Extremity Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability accurately measure daily activity level low extremity amputee patient important well understanding use prosthetic limb . Most study show patient often report activity level inaccurately . More objective data activity level provide information helpful determine appropriate prosthetic component individual , also helpful assess effect medical illness activity level objectively determine benefit rehabilitation . In addition , able measure activity accurately allow verification currently develop clinical survey design determine amputee activity practical form . Until recently practical , accurate affordable mean monitor low extremity amputee activity available use . Currently monitor device design specifically task available research use . It call Patient Activity Monitor ( PAM ) . Many different model generic activity monitoring device , call pedometer , also exist need test amputee population . The objective study measure compare step count ambulation distance accuracy Yamax Digi-Walker pedometer PAM transtibial amputee K3 Level within simulated apartment set relatively continuous gymnasium walking .</detailed_description>
