	<brief_summary>The purpose 8-week study compare effect switch intravenous Flolan intravenous Remodulin therapy . Remodulin ( treprostinil sodium ) approve therapy pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Unlike Flolan , Remodulin need mixed daily stable room temperature , need ice pack . In addition , Remodulin change every 48hrs , instead every 12-24 ( ice pack ) every 8 hour ( without ice pack ) Flolan . Flolan give use type portable medication pump call CADD Legacy infusion pump . In study , Remodulin give use small light medication pump call Crono Five infusion pump . This study also assess effect change Remodulin treatment satisfaction patient quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Efficacy , Treatment Satisfaction Switching From Flolan Remodulin Using Crono Five Ambulatory Pump Patients With PAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define elevation pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance , severe hemodynamic abnormality common variety disease syndromes . Elevation pulmonary arterial pressure cause increase right ventricular afterload , impair right ventricular function ultimately leading inactivity death . The goal PAH treatment lengthen survival time , ameliorate symptom PAH , improve health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) . Remodulin® ( treprostinil sodium ) , stable analogue prostacyclin , possess potent pulmonary systemic vasodilatory platelet anti-aggregatory action vitro vivo . Recently , Remodulin receive FDA approval intravenous therapy base upon bioequivalence intravenous ( IV ) subcutaneous ( SC ) rout administration . Remodulin chemically stable epoprostenol may offer potential safety convenience advantage compare intravenous epoprostenol may impact Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) and/or patient satisfaction . Unlike epoprostenol , Remodulin need mixed daily stable room temperature eliminate need ice pack . Since Remodulin remain body longer epoprostenol ( 4 hr instead less 5 minute ) less risk cardiovascular collapse sudden interruption infusion , line clog . In open-label study Europe , patient use type portable medication pump call CADD Legacy pump rapidly switch Flolan Remodulin serious side effect . This study examine effect switch therapy epoprostenol Flolan IV Remodulin compare change HRQOL treatment satisfaction rapid switch epoprostenol Remodulin patient pulmonary hypertension CADD legacy pump small pump call Crono Five . Participation study last approximately 10 week . Study procedure include routine blood test , medical history , physical exam , disease evaluation , exercise test patient questionnaire . Participants 4 visit study spend least 1 night hospital .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 65 year Diagnosis one follow WHO Classifications pulmonary hypertension : 1 . Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( IPAH ) Familial pulmonary arterial hypertension ( FPAH ) Associated pulmonary arterial hypertension ( APAH ) : 1. collagen vascular disease 2. congenital systemictopulmonary shunt repair great 5 year prior study entry . 3. portal hypertension 4. drug toxins 2 . Group 4 pulmonary hypertension due chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) WHO Class IIIII Currently receive intravenous epoprostenol therapy least three month stable dose least one month . Have central intravenous catheter Optimally treat conventional pulmonary hypertension therapy clinically stable least one month . Mentally physically capable learn administer Remodulin use intravenous infusion pump . nursing pregnant woman receive new type chronic therapy ( include limit oxygen , different category vasodilator , diuretic , digoxin , bosentan , sildenafil ) pulmonary hypertension add within last month . Had PAH medication discontinue within week prior study entry . Received prostacyclin prostacyclin analog except epoprostenol past 3 month . Had central venous line infection within past 30 day . Previous document evidence significant parenchymal lung disease evidence pulmonary function test follow ( one follow ) : 1 . Total Lung Capacity ≤ 60 % ( predict ) 2 . If Total Lung Capacity 60 % 70 % ( predict ) , High Resolution Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan must perform rule diffuse interstitial fibrosis alveolitis History evidence leftsided heart disease Having disease associate pulmonary hypertension ( e.g . sickle cell anemia , schistosomiasis ) . Having musculoskeletal disorder ( e.g . arthritis , artificial leg , etc . ) disease , think limit ambulation , connect machine , portable . Uncontrolled systemic hypertension evidence systolic blood pressure great 160 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) diastolic blood pressure great 100 mmHg . Chronic renal insufficiency define serum creatinine great 2.5 milligram per deciliter ( mg/dL ) requirement dialysis . Receiving investigational drug , place investigational device , participate investigational drug study within past 30 day . Active infection , ongoing condition would interfere interpretation study assessment . The presence physiological psychological condition contraindicates administration Remodulin .</criteria>
