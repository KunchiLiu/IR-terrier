	<detailed_description>Background : The treatment multiple sclerosis evolve light specific drug therapy treat disease , refinement acceptance image MRI diagnose monitor disease process , progress understanding pathogenesis inflammatory demyelinate process . The result raise new issue treatment disease , addressed study , include initiate treatment treatment partial responder exist therapy . Paralleling strides treatment , particular importance Veterans Administration , effectiveness therapy , term cost VA Health Care System quality life veteran multiple sclerosis . This study address issue . Objectives : To consider currently use drug therapy MS veteran , e.g. , Interferon beta-1b , interferon beta-1a glatiramer acetate impact health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) , physical function disability use health care resource within VA . Comparisons group veteran specific chronic medical condition make order develop model health care utilization base index derive disability impairment evaluation HRQoL instrument . Methods : One hundred twenty four veteran clinically definite multiple sclerosis 30 VAMCs participate observational , prospective study . Prior start interferon beta-1b [ IFNB-1b : Betaseron ( tm ) ] , interferon beta-1a [ IFNB-1a : Avonex ( tm ) ] glatiramer acetate [ Copaxone ( tm ) ] baseline assessment obtain : disability impairment use Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) Functional Scales ( FS ) , health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) use veterans-modified version Short Quality Life scale ( SF-36V ) . Follow-up evaluation perform three month every six month thereafter three year . Veterans monitor term change condition , side effect drug , change therapy . Health utilization data obtain include clinic stop , inpatient hospitalization , cost medication supply , training , referral prosthetics , rehabilitative therapy long term care . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
