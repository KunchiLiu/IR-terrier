Patients PSA ≥5 ng/ml radiographic evidence metastatic prostate cancer eligible Evidence progressive disease since recent change therapy . Progressive disease define one following : Objective disease progression : Objective evidence increase radiographic lesion appearance 1 new lesion Bone scan progression : Appearance either following : 2 new lesion bone scan attributable prostate cancer 1 new lesion bone scan attributable prostate cancer conjunction rise PSA PSA progression : 2 consecutively rise PSA level ( ≥5 ng/mL ) separate 2 week testosterone concentration ≤50 ng/dL 2 week interval Serum testosterone level ≤50 ng/dL , determine within 2 week prior start treatment Maintaining castrate status : patient undergone surgical orchiectomy must continue medical therapy , gonadotropinreleasing hormone analog , maintain castrate level serum testosterone . Those receive antiandrogen part firstline hormonal therapy must show progression disease antiandrogen prior enrollment ( 6 week withdrawal bicalutamide ; 4 week flutamide ) Key Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control partner woman childbearing potential Known brain metastasis Clinicallysignificant cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 month ; prolong heart ratecorrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec ; ejection fraction &lt; 40 % , major conduction abnormality ( unless cardiac pacemaker present ) Pleural pericardial effusion , due concern combination docetaxel dasatinib could worsen event Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , ongoing active infection , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation limit compliance study requirement Participants permit continue daily multivitamin herbal , alternative , food supplement must discontinue enrollment study Ketoconazole must discontinue 4 week prior enrollment Patients permit receive radioactive bone target agent , Strontium Samarian , study treatment The following restriction prior therapy metastatic disease apply : One chemotherapy regimen permit long docetaxel resistance intolerance demonstrate .
