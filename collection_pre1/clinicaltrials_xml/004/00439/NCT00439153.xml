	<brief_summary>Tourniquet cuff routinely use stop blood flow patient ' arm legs surgery . This allow surgeon well visualize anatomical structure procedure . Although complication surgery rare , patient sometimes suffer pain numbness limb redness skin area cuff apply . Using low pressure possible minimizes chance problem . Previous study , conduct adult , show base cuff pressure minimum amount pressure necessary stop blood flow limb ( know limb occlusion pressure , LOP ) lead low cuff pressure successfully use . The goal study determine magnitude tourniquet cuff pressure reduce child use tourniquet instrument capable measure LOP combination tourniquet cuff select fit size contour limb . The tourniquet instrument cuff use study commercially available approve use child . Hypothesis : It hypothesize use commercially available tourniquet instrument capable calculate limb occlusion pressure combination tourniquet cuff select applied accord standardized procedure produce surgical field equal superior quality significantly low tourniquet cuff pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose The risk tourniquet-related injury increase increase tourniquet cuff pressure , therefore technique intend minimise tourniquet cuff pressure compare current standard method . A commercially available pneumatic tourniquet capable measuring pressure need occlude blood flow limb , know limb occlusion pressure , combine contour tourniquet cuff show significantly decrease necessary cuff pressure adult patient . The magnitude reduction cuff pressure paediatric population yet determine . Results study may decrease standard tourniquet pressure use paediatric orthopaedic surgeon , thereby reduce risk tourniquet-related injury . 2 . Justification Many study show tourniquet pressure time minimise reduce risk tourniquet related injury post operative complaint . As purpose tourniquet maintain bloodless surgical field , theory minimum cuff pressure require occlude arterial flow ( 'Limb Occlusion Pressure ' LOP ) , plus safety margin allow change condition procedure , use . In practice , surgeon use standard pressure base experience , base indirect measurement systolic blood pressure . Previous study show base cuff pressure LOP measure patient immediately prior limb exsanguination cuff inflation lead low cuff pressure use many adult patient . This technique directly measure cuff pressure require occlude flow , thereby account individual patient 's limb vessel characteristic well type fit cuff . Unfortunately , standard method measure limb occlusion pressure ( monitor distal artery Doppler ultrasound probe slowly increase cuff pressure ) awkward time consume . A tourniquet device allow automatic measurement LOP start surgical procedure commercially available . This device show significantly reduce cuff inflation pressure necessary occlude blood flow adult ; however , magnitude reduction cuff pressure previously determine paediatric population . Previous study also suggest wide tourniquet cuff contour match taper limb apply occlude blood flow low pressure adult . It interest determine wider cuff , contour cuff design well fit taper limb , combination LOP calculation , allow significantly low cuff pressure practical use paediatric patient . 3 . Objectives Quality surgical field primary outcome study . Secondary outcome include reduction tourniquet cuff pressure incidence neurapraxias . 4 . Research Method The target population include subject schedule receive anterior cruciate reconstruction BC Children 's Hospital Dr. Chris Reilly . Subjects prospectively randomize two group . In control group , tourniquet inflation pressure consistent current standard care BC Children Hospital use . In experimental group , tourniquet inflation pressure determine automated calculation limb occlusion pressure plus predetermined safety margin . This technique previously show equivalent Doppler technique determine tourniquet inflation pressure , gold standard . This non-inferiority trial power set 0.8 alpha 0.05 . The estimated sample size 21 patient group . 5 . Method The study single blind , randomise , prospective clinical comparison two technique use determine tourniquet cuff pressure . The quality surgical field compare experimental group ( cuff pressure determine LOP calculation ) control group ( standard cuff pressure 300 mm Hg ) . At start study , 21 seal envelope indicate 'LOP + paediatric cuff ' 21 indicate 'standard pressure + standard cuff ' prepared . The envelope place block 4 6 order minimise predictive effect . After group patient determine , person normally responsible tourniquet cuff application select envelope apply indicate cuff indicated pressure . For 'LOP + paediatric cuff ' group , cuff selection application base standardized guide use determine appropriate size shape cuff give limb . See cuff application guideline ( attach ) . Once indicated cuff apply , photoplethysmographic LOP sensor clip toe affect leg , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) record , automate LOP routine activate . LOP recommend tourniquet pressure ( RTP = LOP + predetermine margin ) display within 1 minute record . The limb exsanguinated follow surgeon 's usual procedure cuff inflate RTP . For 'standard pressure + standard cuff ' group , cuff selection application make base principal investigator 's current practice . The limb exsanguinated follow surgeon 's usual procedure cuff inflated standard pressure , base current practice predetermine surgeon acceptable . At surgeon 's discretion , cuff pressure may increase decreased time procedure , SBP , time , reason change record . Immediately follow end procedure , surgeon ( principal investigator ) rate overall quality surgical field use visual analogue scale . He also provide area comment visualization capability specific aspect procedure difficulty may occur . Tourniquet inflation time variation SBP take anaesthetist chart record . Incidence post operative neurapraxias also determine . Patient recruitment enrolment continue enough subject recruit show statistical significance , currently estimate 21 subject per group . Differences quality surgical field tourniquet inflation pressure compare two group , addition incidence neurapraxias .</detailed_description>
