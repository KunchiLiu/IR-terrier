	<brief_summary>This study explore sequence effect , fatigue tiredness commonly see patient Parkinson 's disease thing . The study use new device call modify peg board test ( see description ) measure whether antiparkinsonian medication ( levodopa/carbidopa dopamine ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS , see description ) brain improve symptom sequence effect . Patients early-stage Parkinson 's disease never take antiparkinsonian medication patient advanced disease may eligible study . Candidates must 18 year age old right-handed . Participants five visit NIH Clinical Center follow : - Visit 1 ( baseline ) : Patients neurological examination , include brief cognitive function test , rating depression , two type rating fatigue severity . - Visits 2 5 ( experimental session ) : Patients take antiparkinson medication long time ask take medication 12 hour ( overnight withdrawal ) visit 2 5 . They medication 14 hour total ( experiment do ) . Patients may admit NIH Clinical Center overnight drug withdrawal necessary . At start session , participant give either levodopa/carbidopa tablet placebo ( tablet identical appearance active medication ) . They perform modify pegboard test medication , medication , brain stimulation rTMS . During two session , receive actual brain stimulation , two session receive sham stimulation , actually stimulate brain . The modified pegboard test computer-based machine eight peg . Subjects transfer peg line hole right side line hole leave side use right hand move quickly possible . After finish move peg leave line hole , wait beep transfer peg leave line right line hole . They six time , three time right hand three time leave . rTMS involves repeat magnetic pulse deliver train short burst impulse . A brief electrical current pass wire coil hold scalp . The current create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle face , arm leg . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap onto skin right hand . Subjects receive four rTMS block per 10 minute . Each block consist total 375 pulse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The long-term goal provide new insight effect long-lasting sequence movement ( sequence effect ) investigating de novo advance Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient objective measurement . Our central hypothesis sequence effect cause depressed excitability motor cortex , partially associate dopaminergic deficiency . Specifically , aim study show sequence effect severe advanced PD de novo PD evaluate extent improvement levodopa repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) show correlation fatigue . Study Population : Twelve de novo PD patient 12 age- sex-matched advanced PD patient . Design : We compare objectively measure sequence effect modify Purdue pegboard , computer-based device , de novo advanced PD patient . The modified Purdue Pegboard detect start stop time individual peg insertion task entirety . The sequence effect protocol detect progressive change time interval per peg insertion test session . A time interval define period start stop time individual peg insertion . We conduct placebo-controlled , four-way crossover study determine beneficial effect levodopa rTMS sequence effect de novo advanced PD . The four intervention : levodopa rTMS ; levodopa sham ; placebo rTMS ; placebo sham . A replicate 4 period four intervention-Latin Square design use crossover design . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome difference two time interval , individual 1st 8th peg insertion time , 1st run ( 8-consecutive peg insertion ) right hand , compare de novo PD advance PD . The secondary outcome : ( ) difference progressive change six time value six run ; ( b ) beneficial effect levodopa rTMS sequence effect ; ( c ) correlation time interval first eighth peg insertion score two subjective fatigue scale , i.e. , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 year old . Right hand dominant ( Edinburgh Handedness Quotient great 60 ) . Able provide consent protocol . Hoehn &amp; Yahr stag : I III ( de novo PD patient ) ; II IV ( advanced PD patient ) . Never treat antiparkinsonian medication ( de novo PD patient ) . Able go antiparkinsonian medication minimum 14 hour ( advanced PD patient ) , i.e . overnight withdrawal experiment complete NIH . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients medical , surgical , neurological psychiatric condition except PD . Patients know symptomatic wearing . Pregnant woman . Concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug antiparkinsonian agent could lower seizure threshold . Persons surgically traumatically implanted foreign body pacemaker , implanted medication pump , metal plate skull , metal inside skull eye ( dental appliance filling ) , intracardiac line may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation also exclude . Patients history seizure disorder epilepsy . Subjects without capacity give inform consent . If participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue risk stress reason excessive fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehension .</criteria>
