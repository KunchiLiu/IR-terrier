	<brief_summary>There evidence variety animal study choroidal blood flow neural control . By contrast , little information available human study . Recent result indicate light/dark transition associate short last reduction choroidal blood flow . We show unilateral dark/light transition eye react choroidal vasoconstriction strongly indicate neural mechanism . The present study investigate possibility use pharmacological intervention . The pharmacological agent test include nitric oxide synthase inhibitor , alpha-receptor agonist ( control substance blood pressure increase nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ) , muscarinic receptor blocker , non-specific beta-blocker . These drug choose basis previous animal experiment , system , specifically influenced substance , likely involved neural control choroidal blood flow .</brief_summary>
