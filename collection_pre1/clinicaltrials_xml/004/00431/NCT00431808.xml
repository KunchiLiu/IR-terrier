	<brief_summary>This study first time candidate malaria vaccine Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( PfAMA-1-FVO [ 25-545 ] ) test malaria endemic population . The phase Ib study include adult randomly allocate either receive malaria vaccine vaccine Tetanus . Each participant receive 3 immunization , without clinical investigator participant know give . They follow-up immediate reaction vaccination , also long term one year . Blood take evaluate biological safety parameter also immune response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial evaluate Safety Immunogenicity recombinant pichia pastoris blood stage malaria vaccine Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( PfAMA-1-FVO [ 25-545 ] ) versus tetanus toxoid , healthy Malian adult Bandiagara . A phase Ia trial currently ongoing interim result use select best dose/adjuvant combination bring Africa . The trial evaluate safety immunogenicity AMA-1 ( 10 µg 50 µg ) adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide Montanide ISA 720 , ASO2 . - Primary objective : - To evaluate safety one dose AMA-1 ( 10 µg 50 µg ) adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide Montanide ISA 720 , ASO2 , give D0 , D28 D56 healthy Malian adult . - Secondary Objectives : - To assess humoral response vaccine antigen measure variation level IgG ability recognize native protein merozoite . - To assess cellular immune response measure T cell proliferation cytokine production follow vitro stimulation vaccine antigen . The primary immunization administer day 0 , 28 boost give day 56 . The participant follow actively vaccination phase , passively one another 9 month . The 19 schedule clinic visit follow schedule obtain serology data D-28 , D0 , D28 , D56 , D84 , D140 D365 - The primary evaluation include follow : - Solicited adverse event measure day 0 day 7 dose ; - Unsolicited adverse event measure one month dose ; - Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) measure 12 month study duration . - Biological safety : two four week vaccination , thereafter every 12 week , reference baseline first dose , measure follow RBC , hemoglobin , hematocrit , MCV , MCH , MCHC , platelet , WBC differential count , potassium , sodium , ASAT , ALAT , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , γGT , creatinin . - Secondary evaluation criterion : - The humoral response vaccine antigen : assessed measure level IgG ELISA . - An IFA least two parasite strain use verify antibody elicit vaccine recognize native protein merozoites - Statistical method : Descriptive method shall employ evaluate criterion .</detailed_description>
