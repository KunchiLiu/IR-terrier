	<brief_summary>The metabolic risk associate obesity closely correlated central ( abdominal ) , rather peripheral ( gluteofemoral ) fat pattern It show weight loss bariatric surgery follow metabolic improvement . The amount fat lose site may independently regulate . Very scant information find literature regard relative change different fat body compartment , effect improvement metabolic profile .

	<detailed_description>The metabolic risk associate obesity closely correlated central ( abdominal ) , rather peripheral ( gluteofemoral ) fat pattern . The amount fat lose site may independently regulate . Very scant information find literature regard relative change different fat body compartment . Rapid preferential reduction visceral fat mass could occur morbid obese visceral obesity . It previously show , also partially confirm study , reduction visceral fat associate metabolic improvement include improved glucose tolerance reduce plasma insulin lipid level . This suggest threshold proportional visceral fat loss , improvement insulin sensitivity component metabolic syndrom . We quantify different fat compartment change bariatric surgery mean CT scan .</detailed_description>
