	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Laser TURP With Without Dutasteride .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) common neoplastic condition afflict middle-aged elderly men . BPH non-cancerous condition prostate becomes enlarge cause lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . These symptom include : frequency , urgency , weak urinary stream , difficulty start stop urinate feel need urinate even finish urinate . One minimally invasive treatment BPH Laser TURP . The men go study would plan Holmium Laser TURP Northwestern Memorial Hospital Chicago , Illinois . Another treatment BPH use class drug call 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors ( 5ARI ) . Dutasteride 5ARI approve U.S. Food drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment BPH . Each participant study randomize ONE treatment group : 1 . Laser TURP combine Dutasteride 2 . Laser TURP combine placebo . This study double-masked mean neither participant , study staff know receive active study drug placebo . There 50 % chance receiving study drug , Dutasteride , 50 % chance receive placebo . Dutasteride 's placebo come 0.5mg capsule take mouth day bedtime . There screen period may last 8 week . It include : - There 2 3 screen visit clinic visit last approximately 2.5 3 hour . - Each participant ask complete various form questionnaire regard low urinary tract symptom effect sexual function . - No study drug take time . - The Laser TURP Northwestern Memorial Hospital schedule . If requirement meet determined participant eligible participate trial participant come clinic randomization visit . At visit participant randomize one two treatment group note . Randomization like flip coin neither participant , study staff choose treatment give . Each participant start take study drug everyday six week undergo Laser TURP continue take study drug every day one year Laser TURP . If Laser TURP require catheter place , participant see urology clinic staff follow visit catheter . This follow schedule may require weekly visit . There follow visit research staff . The participant ask come research clinic every three month one year . Each follow visit last approximately 1.5 hour . A final visit take place one year . This identical first screen visit . This visit last approximately 2 hour . If participant decides withdraw study early ask come office early withdrawal visit . Please note : The detailed information regard research study 's entirety . All discuss complete detail upon meet research staff member call contact person mention protocol registration .</detailed_description>

The patient active urinary tract disease undergone cystoscopy biopsy prostate within two week prior first screen visit . The patient know primary neurologic condition multiple sclerosis Parkinson 's disease neurological disease know affect bladder function . The patient document bacterial prostatitis within past year . The patient two document urinary tract infection type past year . A urinary tract infection define &gt; 100,000 colony per ml urine midstream clean catch catheterize specimen . The patient severe bleed disorder make laser TURP impossible . The patient must able stop anticoagulant , NSAID antiplatelet 7 day prior laser TURP . The patient cancer consider cure ( except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ) . A patient consider cured evidence cancer within five year randomization . The patient diagnosis think disorder ( i.e. , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder ) The patient serious medical condition likely impede successful completion study . The patient defibrillator deactivate laser TURP treatment . A bladder neck verumontanum distance le 30mm length measure flexible cystoscopy total prostate volume &lt; 25 ml &gt; 110 ml measure prostate volume ellipsoid formula TRUS .</criteria>
