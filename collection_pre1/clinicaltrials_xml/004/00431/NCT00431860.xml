	<detailed_description>A large proportion patient sudden cardiac death nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) prior symptom , emphasize importance early detection treatment underlie subclinical coronary atherosclerosis happen . However , powerful screen method detect subclinical coronary atherosclerosis recently . Traditional CAD risk factor , treadmill exercise test , EBCT know limited power detect subclinical coronary atherosclerosis predict future cardiac event . Coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) depict detailed coronary artery anatomy noninvasive fashion would seem already one mainstay diagnostic procedure symptomatic population . Instead probability significant stenosis , CTA could provide information location , burden characteristic atherosclerotic plaque per se , might give additional insight stratify risk future cardiac event therapy . In study , evaluate prevalence characteristic subclinical coronary atherosclerosis CTA impact management asymptomatic population . And , develop standardize protocol management subclinical coronary atherosclerosis , follow adverse cardiac event . In phase I study , enroll subject undergone CTA analyze characteristic plaque CTA . Also , evaluate impact CTA compare performance secondary test undergone CTA evaluation . In phase II study , recruit subject significant coronary stenosis CTA . If patient significant stenosis , undergo coronary angiography confirm severity stenosis . If coronary artery stenosis 75 % , receive percutaneous coronary intervention drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . If intermediate lesion , treatment option judge result fractional flow reserve test . If coronary lesion le 50 % , treat medication . When patient eligible study , investigator give information study obtain write consent . The presence chest pain symptom screen Rose questionnaire . Medical history physical examination perform , baseline laboratory work-up perform . Following treatment guideline , patient follow adverse cardiac event 5 year .</detailed_description>
