	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common manifestation systemic atherosclerosis account significant morbidity mortality among end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient . However , study identify prevalence clinical impact PAD specific population . Objectives : To perform single-blinded parallel , control trial examine effect cilostazol treatment plasma VEGF level , tissue factor , inflammatory marker ( IL-6 , hsCRP ) level , oxidative stress marker ESRD patient PAD Material method Fourty HD patient maintenance HD &gt; 3months enrolled prospective , single-blinded , randomize study . These patient randomly allocate 2 arm . After baseline assessment , patient treatment arm receive 12 week add therapy cilostazol 100mg/day . Blood pressure , heart rate , oxidative stress ( malonyldialdehyde , protein carbonyl ADMA ) , inflammatory marker ( hsCRP , IL-6 ) plasma , VEGF tissue factor level measure treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : Patients end stage renal disease increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) annual mortality CVD end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient substantially high general population . Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , common manifestation atherosclerosis , characterize atherosclerotic occlusive disease low extremity . The common symptom PAD intermittent claudication , define pain , cramping , ache calf , thigh , buttock . However , report one-half PAD remain asymptomatic . Rest pain , tissue loss , gangrene among extreme presentation PAD PAD major cause lower-extremity amputation , especially HD patient diabetes . However , available data stress huge burden PAD hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . More importantly , presence PAD patient important predictor subsequent cardiovascular overall mortality . The medical therapy PAD general population limit antiplatelet drug statin relatively descriptive study randomize control trial . There appropriate randomized trial therapy treatment PAD patient chronic kidney disease . Hence , yet substantial data support efficacy pharmacologic intervention PAD specific group patient . Hypothesis Use cilosatzol may associate increase plasma level VEGF TF amelioration inflammation HD patient PAD.to perform parallel , control trial examine effect cilostazol treatment plasma VEGF level , tissue factor , inflammatory marker ( IL-6 , hsCRP ) level , oxidative stress marker ESRD patient PAD . Many human disease characterize disorder vasculature . In ischemic heart disease peripheral artery disease , insufficient blood vasculature lead tissue ischemia . Out many player angiogenesis field , vascular endothelial growth factor far best characterized several VEGFs already enter clinical use variety human condition . While many study address role angiogenesis blood vasculature human physiology pathology , role proangiogenic therapy PAD recently attract little attention . VEGF prime hypoxia inducible angiogenic factor bind VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 . VEGF increase permeability endothelium formation intercellular gap , vesico-vascular organelle , vacuole well fenestration . VEGF also cause vasodilatation induction endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) subsequent increase nitric oxide production . In recent year , several study report beneficial effect VEGF use proangiogenic therapy set tissue ischemia . While proangiogenic therapy could employ treatment various ischemic disease , control process target molecular therapy remain heart research . Cilostazol phosphodiesterase III inhibitor profound pharmacological profile . Cilostazol , { 6 [ 4- ( 1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl ) butoxy ] -3,4-dihydro-2- ( 1H ) - quinolinone } 2-oxoquinolone derivative ( molecular weight , 369.47 ) plasma half-life 10.564.4 hour oral administration . It inhibit primary secondary platelet aggregation response ADP , collagen , epinephrine , arachidonic acid . The antiplatelet vasodilator property cilostazol attribute ability elevate intracellular level cAMP.3 Cilostazol currently use treatment symptomatic intermittent claudication ( IC ) .Studies perform diabetic patient indicate , addition vasodilator antiplatelet property . Cilostazol may also favorably modify plasma lipoprotein increase HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) reduce triglyceride . Numerous trial evaluate anti-proliferative property cilostazol find prevent restenosis patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . In Japanese patient type 2 diabetes , cilostazol therapy associate regression carotid intimal thickness . The observed efficacy cilostazol fully explain . Most investigator hypothesize cilostazol exhibit pharmacologic effect via antiplatelet , vasodilatory , antithrombotic activity . Other postulate mechanism cilostazol action include ) anti-proliferative function prevent restenosis PCI , b ) improve lipid profile c ) prevent atherosclerosis via inhibition expression adhesion molecule . Some hypothesis may valid , clearly confirmatory study need . Although cilostazol property , effect expression VEGF oxidative stress biomarkers know For purpose , plan study change lipoprotein level , proangiogenetic factor , inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial activation follow 12 week cilostazol group 40 HD patient . We feel present study may help shed light broaden understand pathophysiological mechanism underlie beneficial effect cilostazol give insight role antiplatelet drug PAD improve clinical symptom plausibly reduce cardiovascular event</detailed_description>
