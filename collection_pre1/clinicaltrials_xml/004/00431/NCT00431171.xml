	<brief_summary>The current study phase I open-label clinical trial examine plasma level oral lithium treatment 20 subject chronic spinal cord injury . The subject receive standard dos oral lithium use treatment manic depression . The goal trial show feasibility safety maintain plasma level 0.6 mmol/L 1.2 mmol/L six week subject chronic spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics Study Oral Lithium Patients With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients spinal cord injury ( SCI ) usually permanent often devastate neurological deficit disability . There successful research number field may someday help people spinal cord injury . The planned treatment trial focus effect oral lithium neurological function people chronic spinal cord injury receive umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant spinal cord . The interest two treatment derive recent report indicate umbilical cord blood stem cell may beneficial spinal cord injury lithium may promote regeneration recovery function spinal cord injury . Both lithium umbilical cord blood widely available therapy long use treat disease human . The current study phase I open-label clinical trial examine plasma level oral lithium treatment 20 subject chronic spinal cord injury . The subject receive standard dos oral lithium use treatment manic depression . The goal trial show feasibility safety maintain plasma level 0.6 mmol/L 1.2 mmol/L six week subject chronic spinal cord injury . Lithium attract much attention potential neuroregenerative therapy base experiment animal model SCI 2004 . However , toxic level lithium ( &gt; 1.5 mmol/L ) close effective level ( 0.6 - 1.2 mmol/L ) . At toxic level , patient may become confused lethargic , diarrhea , upset stomach , develop tremor , ataxia , dysarthria , nystagmus . Lithium toxicity may compound sodium depletion diuretic ( thiazide ) inhibit kidney sodium upgrade ACE inhibitor . Plasma level also depend fluid input/output . Therefore , care take titrate dose test plasma level drug beginning , day 2 , 7 , week 6 treatment period . Acute toxicity usually produce relatively mild symptom . Chronic lithium toxicity may lead severe neurotoxic symptom . However , symptom usually develop 3-5 year treatment . Data obtain study use develop future chronic spinal cord injury clinical study : ( 1 ) randomize control trial lithium versus placebo ; ( 2 ) randomize control trial compare effect lithium placebo subject receive umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplant spinal cord .</detailed_description>
