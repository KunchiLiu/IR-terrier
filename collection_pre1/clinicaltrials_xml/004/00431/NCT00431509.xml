	<brief_summary>This study undertaken investigate effect navigate knee implantation surgery physical function , joint stiffness , pain , quality life coordinative ability . One group patient receive navigate knee implantation surgery , traditional knee implantation surgery , without use navigation system . The study design randomize trial . That mean patient give consent participate study allocate either navigated conventional surgery chance . A total 477 patient include study follow 12 month . In period patient ask fill functional quality life questionnaire baseline , 6 week 3 , 6 12 month follow-up . Coordinative ability evaluate time-frame 3 6 month postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Navigated Conventional Implantation Techniques Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various risk factor influence success Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) study . Today age , gender , primary revision surgery , comorbidities baseline characteristic know influence health-related quality life TKA . It think , accurate mechanical alignment ligament balance ensure optimal kinematic performance wear , turn improve long-term outcome . During preparation bone implantation knee prosthesis , numerous cut perform . Traditionally mechanical adjusted jig use accurately align position instrument . Since alignment process source deviation even experience surgeon , several navigation system develop . Using system , surgeon guide location instrument help computer . Several study could show use navigation system lead improved execution plan axis relation , measure radiograph . However , clear , whether extent improve realization preoperative plan axis relation result positive effect patient . This multicenter randomize clinical trail conduct compare operative result navigate non-navigated knee replacement surgery . The aim study evaluate use navigation system health-related quality life , measure pain , stiffness , physical function , coordinative ability , patient satisfaction . The hypothesis test use navigation system total knee arthroplasty lead improve health-related quality life .</detailed_description>
