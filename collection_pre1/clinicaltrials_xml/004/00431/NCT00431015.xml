	<detailed_description>IPI-504 novel small molecule inhibitor heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) , emerge recently identify target cancer therapy . Hsp90 protein chaperone play central role maintain proper folding , function viability various `` client protein '' . Many client protein stabilize Hsp90 oncoproteins cell-signaling protein important cancer cell proliferation cancer cell survival . This clinical trial study effect IPI-504 molecularly define sub-group patient carry client protein find non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
