	<detailed_description>- The first step research study peripheral blood collection . Approximately 60-90cc 's collect intravenously use prepare EBV immunotherapy product . It take 12 week make EBV immunotherapy product . During time , participant receive standard care prescribe doctor . - The EBV immunotherapy product make laboratory Connell &amp; O'Reilly Families Cell Manipulation Core Facility Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . The EBV immunotherapy product contain T-cells may react EBV-related tumor . - A small amount EBV product use research study investigate component immune system might important effective immunotherapy NPC . - EBV immunotherapy product give participant intravenously ( infusion ) first day research study . Fourteen day later , participant receive infusion # 2 . After infusion # 2 , research doctor test determine effect EBV immunotherapy product tumor . If research doctor think participant benefit third infusion may receive one . - Before infusion EBV immunotherapy product , physical examination blood test perform . During active treatment phase research study , physical exam blood test do every 1-2 week . - Before infusion EBV immunotherapy product , research doctor may fiberoptic exam participant nasopharynx use flexible scop visualize tumor . - At 8 week post-infusion , evaluate tumor use CT scan and/or MRI . We also perform PET PET/CT scan research doctor feel necessary . We may chest CT scan see tumor spread lung abdominal/pelvic CT scan MRI participant symptom suggest may tumor liver , bone scan see tumor bone . - In addition study , research doctor may ask permission participate optional research study . We would like participant permission take biopsy tumor receive infusion # 2 . The biopsy do surgeon review risk procedure . - The participant return clinic follow-up visit response tumor evaluate , blood test physical exam perform following interval : first 2 month final infusion , every 2-4 week ; month 4 month 12 final infusion , every 2 month ; second year final infusion , every 3 month .</detailed_description>
