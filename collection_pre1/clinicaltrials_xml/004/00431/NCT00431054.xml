	<brief_title>Perifosine Docetaxel Patients With Relapsed Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel chemotherapy drug design kill cancer believe slightly effective kill blood vessel cancer . Perifosine new drug may help docetaxel effective cause cancer cell die . Perifosine alone may slow cancer cell growth target abnormal pathway ovarian cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , receive dose perifosine mouth every 6 hour Day 1 therapy . The actual number pill dose depend upon dose level assign . You continue receive perifosine mouth day 20 day . Each cycle treatment 28 day . On Day 5 therapy , first cycle , blood drawn ( 2.5 tablespoon ) perform , 5 hair follicle ascites collect , available . If ascites , FNA perform tumor . On Day 8 therapy , DCE-MRI . On Day 10 therapy , PET scan . Your treatment schedule cycle usually . There may one-day difference treatment schedule . After first cycle complete , begin receive docetaxel , Day 2 therapy cycle treatment , injection vein 60 minute M. D. Anderson infusion center . The second cycle treatment start Day 29 . Within 72 hour start cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . After receive drug , weekly blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) evaluate well . Before start cycle therapy , physical exam , medical history record . You also call study doctor staff ask question side effect may experience therapy . After end every 2 cycle ( every 8 week ) , x-ray either CT scan MRI re-evaluate cancer . You may give treatment study long disease get bad . Your physician discus maximum number treatment cycle receive . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . After participation study end , come back follow-up visit . At visit , medical history record physical exam . You blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You may also CT scan MRI re-measure re-evaluate cancer . You follow-up long need complete treatment perifosine plus docetaxel . You either contact phone ask come clinic routine visit . You contact every 8 week . You radiographic evaluation , either CT MRI , do every 12 week evaluate cancer growth start another anticancer therapy . This investigational study . Perifosine authorize FDA use research . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
