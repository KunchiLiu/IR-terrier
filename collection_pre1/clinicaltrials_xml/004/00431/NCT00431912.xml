	<brief_summary>This phase II study design determine efficacy safety APO866 treatment patient advance form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . APO866 show induce growth inhibition culture human CTCL cell well animal model subcutaneously implant human CTCL tumor . APO866 consider safe well-tolerated phase I study treat 24 patient advanced cancer . APO866 administer intravenous infusion continuously 96 hour repeat every 4 week . Patients receive 3 cycle treatment primary efficacy endpoint assess Week 16. patient follow 12 month</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study APO866 Treatment Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTCL frequent occur cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterize indolent protract course patch , plaque tumor . It highly symptomatic , debilitate , disfigure impact patient 's quality life . The treatment strategy CTCL base exact diagnosis include stage disease aim preserve cellular immune function , achieve anti-tumor effect . Given nature disease cumulative additive toxicity treatment use , intensity duration long-term therapy limit . APO866 novel drug induces cell death specifically inhibit biosynthesis NAD+ niacinamide , essential cellular metabolism , protein modification ( e.g . PARP mediate DNA repair , sirtuins ( histone deacetylation ) ) Calcium dependent messenger synthesis . APO866 subject commonly know mechanism MDR . Its activity cell cycle independent . APO866 exert high anti-tumor activity broad range different tumor cell derive human solid cancer leukemias vitro large number human xenograft nude mice rat vivo . Hematologic cancer cell highly sensitive APO866 . Lymphocytes sensitive normal cell APO866 result lymphocytopenia reticulocytopenia rat , monkey cancer patient . Furthermore , APO866 may anti-angiogenic property show vivo patient . APO866 show induce , low nM level , growth inhibition human Myla CTCL cell well human subcutaneous xenograft Myla CTCL Balb-C nude mouse . APO866 investigate 24 patient advanced cancer phase I study aim determine DLT MTD . Treatment well tolerate safe . The unique DLT thrombocytopenia . At dose level higher 0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia , think clinically relevant , preceded toxicity . The recommend dose phase II study APO866 0.126 mg/m2/hr administer civ infusion 4 consecutive day ( MTD ) . This dose select safety profile , translational observation Css APO866 MTD similar high compare concentration efficacy establish vitro vivo . No objective tumor response observe . However , 4 patient stable disease least 3 month : prostate cancer ( 4 month ) , melanoma ( 5 month ) , sarcomatoid mesothelioma ( 3 month ) oropharyngeal cancer ( 5 month ) . In addition , lesion size reduction observe melanoma patient ( 80 % size reduction stable size lesion ) APO866 dose level 0.072 mg/m2/hr , mesothelioma patient ( moderate size reduction pleural lesion ) 0.108 mg/m2/hr . Treatment APO866 safe well tolerate . The anti-tumor effect APO866 , particular hematological cancer cell vitro ex vivo , lymphocytopenic effect patient support rationale conduct open phase II study APO866 patient refractory relapse CTCL qualify systemic chemotherapy</detailed_description>
