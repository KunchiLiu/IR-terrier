	<criteria>Pathologic confirmation CLL . Prior Treatment . There limit prior therapy . Therapy fludarabine Rituxan must fail ( disease progression , intolerance , candidate ) . Age 18 year great . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Laboratory requirement ( must do within 7 day prior study initiation ) : Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . Aspartate transaminase ( AST/SGOT ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Serum Creatinine ≤1 .5 x ULN . Patients legal representative must able read , understand , sign write informed consent ( approved institutional review board/Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC ) ) within 14 day prior start treatment . Patients another active cancer ( exclude basal cell carcinoma cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN/cervical situ ) melanoma situ ) . Prior history cancer allow , long active disease . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test document within 7 day prior start study drug . WOCBP men whose partner WOCBP must use acceptable method contraception enrol study , period 3 month follow study drug treatment . Patients unwilling unable follow guideline exclude . An example acceptable form contraception double barrier method , condom diaphragm . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness , active uncontrolled infection , fever &gt; 38.5ºC ( due tumor fever ) day schedule dosing . Patients serious illness , medical condition , medical history , include laboratory result , , investigator 's opinion , would likely interfere patient 's participation study , interpretation result . Patients treat investigational drug within 28 day prior study initiation ( investigational drug one approve indication ) , receive concurrent treatment experimental drug anticancer therapy . Patients must recover transient toxicity induce prior therapy . Known hypersensitivity HDAC inhibitor , component MG0103 ( refer IB ) . Patients know anaphylaxis IgEmediated hypersensitivity murine proteins component rituximab allow receive rituximab concomitantly study . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know active Hepatitis B C. Testing require patient suspected condition . For patient history Hepatitis B C longer active , Investigator contact MethylGene advance confirm patient 's eligibility . Any condition ( e.g. , know suspected poor compliance , psychological instability , geographical location , etc ) , judgment investigator , may affect patient 's ability sign inform consent undergo study procedure . Any condition put patient undue risk discomfort result adherence study procedure . For example , consider requirement take MG0103 lowpH drink recommendation avoid agent increase gastricpH .</criteria>
