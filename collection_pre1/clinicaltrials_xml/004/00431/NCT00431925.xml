	<brief_title>Can Cytokines Predict Severity Acute Mucositis Need Gastrostomy Tubes ( PEG ) ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucositis significant detrimental effect patient 's quality life term pain , ability eat , swallow talk . It may severe interruption therapy require , consequently influence tumor response overall patient outcome . The degree mucositis varies different patient : patient may develop limited condition , confine patch mildly sore erythematous mucosa , others may experience diffuse area painful ulceration . In severe case , pain may overwhelm prevents patient swallow food fluid . The patient therefore risk develop malnutrition , must treat vigorously . In respect , use gastrostomy tube ( PEG ) show beneficial . Another aspect radiation induce mucositis health-care cost . Patients severe mucositis statistically great outpatient support cost ; include maintenance appropriate nutritional hydration support , placement gastrostomy tube . In U.S , mucositis overall medical cost order approximately $ 3000± $ 1000 , per treatment . Completion full course irradiation , without interruption , important achieve best possible result cancer H &amp; N . It therefore essential identify refer patient risk receive effective timely nutritional intervention . Since mucositis represent clinical continuum differs patient , difficult assess before-hand patient risk develop severe mucositis course radiotherapy . In today 's practice , patient undergo radiation therapy H &amp; N undergo feed gastrostomy treat physician prior treatment anticipate severe mucositis , base radiation field , chemotherapy use , prior experience . Some procedure eventually unnecessary . In case gastrostomy placed priory , common practice monitoring patient treatment . If weight loss exceed 10 % initial body weight , feed gastrostomy recommend ( time point , mucositis usually severe , many patient need admission fluid administration semi-urgent procedure ) . Unfortunately , simple laboratory tool available , could predict patient susceptible develop severe mucositis dysphagia , eventually require feed gastrostomy . Mucositis develop four successive phase : inflammation phase , epithelial phase , ulceration phase lastly , heal phase . The first phase , inflammation , also entitle `` initial tissue injury phase '' , result production pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 TNF-α . In general , inflammatory cytokine IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-α elevate inflammatory condition find increase level blood tissue fluid inflammation , anti-inflammatory cytokine produce decreased manner . In breast cancer patient , show change cytokine level , Including IL-1β IL-6 , also correspond response malignant tissue treatment . In case , good clinical response therapy associate decrease IL-1β IL-6 level , versus increase level associate progression disease . Furthermore , tumor marker cytokeratin TPS , show sensitive assess tumor 's response therapy patient 's prognosis . It emphasize though , finding cite reflect response tumor cell therapy , propose project deal radiation effect normal tissue tumor . The main purpose study find best indicator prognosticator mucositis occur healthy oral tissue H &amp; N cancer patient receive treatment , understand cytokine balance mechanism action . Assuming correlation high cytokine level inflammation severity radiation induce mucositis , find prognostic factor may help u predict first part treatment need PEG , place prior complication associate severe mucositis one hand , avoid unnecessary procedure hand . This study may also lead new strategy assess severity mucositis laboratory test , tool use objective assessment develop strategy aim reduce mucositis . The understanding cytokine balance condition also translate use anti-cytokine treatment condition , similar immune related disease RA , Crohn 's Disease MS . Secondary aim study measure recently available tumor marker SCC TPS , correlate tumor response . Genetic marker assess extreme alteration radiation reaction severe skin reaction , early unexpectedly severe mucositis , hand - lack response . The blood task collect prospectively , evaluate end study . The study comprise least 14 35 patient H &amp; N epithelial cancer . Patients clinically evaluate week treatment , treatment period weekly . Blood sample drown cytokine prior treatment , week 2 , 4 end treatment . The serum collect separated following factor : 1 . Inflammatory Cytokines : IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-18 TNF α . 2 . Anti inflammatory cytokine : IL-10 TGF β . 3 . Tumor marker : SCC TPS . 4 . Genetic assessment gene may involve extreme treatment reaction . At weekly follow , patient assess mucositis physician use WHO common toxicity criterion , answer mucositis questionnaire ( base RTOG/EORTC questionnaire ) . Patient 's weight also record . Scientific aim The primary aim : 1 . To investigate relationship cytokine level clinically suggest PEG end H &amp; N chemo-irradiation . 2 . To investigate whether correlation exists blood cytokine ( inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokine ) level severity radiation induce mucositis patient receive chemo-radiotherapy cancer H &amp; N . 3 . To investigate whether blood cytokine level could serve simple laboratory tool , predict severity mucositis dysphagia occur H &amp; N chemo-irradiation . The secondary aim : 1 . To study clinical usefulness Tumor Markers SCC TPS setting , namely , evaluate correlation blood level response therapy . 2 . To compare associate mucositis two commonly use radiation treatment strategy - IMRT 5 field plan classic two dimensional plan subgroup patient advanced glottic supraglottic cancer . 3 . To assess whether cytokine level treatment predict long term treatment related toxicity .</detailed_description>
