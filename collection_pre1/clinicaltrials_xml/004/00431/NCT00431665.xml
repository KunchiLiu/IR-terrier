	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes frequently associate elevation plasma-free fatty acid ( FFA ) . Studies indicate elevation plasma-FFA induces insulin resistance also cause endothelial dysfunction well hemodynamic change suppose involved pathogenesis diabetic vascular disorder . Glomerular hyperfiltration , associate glomerular hypertension hypertrophy , common find early course type 1 diabetes well type 2 diabetes , play important role development progression diabetic nephropathy . These hemodynamic change well understood , likely induced dilatation ( precapillary ) glomerular arteriole . In human hemodynamic effect FFAs far investigate locally brachial femoral artery recently eye skin , FFAs induce pronounced increase blood flow probably due local decrease vascular resistance . The aim present study characterise hemodynamic effect FFAs kidney . In addition want test hypothesis FFA-induced change mediate via endothelial derive nitric oxide ( NO ) . The result study could provide information extent elevate FFA-plasma level contribute hyperfiltration early course diabetes mellitus . The measurement do baseline 4 hour infusion triglyceride placebo infusion , combine heparin .</brief_summary>
