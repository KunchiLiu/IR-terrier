Has history document peptic ulcer disease ( via endoscopy xray ) , active peptic ulcer disease , gastrointestinal obstruction , increase intracranial pressure , hypercalcemia , uncontrolled medical condition ( malignancy ) opinion Investigator may confound result study , represent another potential etiology emesis nausea ( CINV ) pose unwarranted risk subject . Has know hypersensitivity contraindication ZOFRAN , another 5HT3 receptor antagonist , dexamethasone , component casopitant . Has previously receive NK1 receptor antagonist . An active systemic infection uncontrolled disease ( malignancy ) , opinion investigator , may confound result study pose unwarranted risk subject . Subjects previous , current , history alcoholism may permit provide , investigator 's opinion , subject 's disease state confound result study . Receiving plan receive systemic corticosteroid therapy dose within 72 hour prior first dose study medication , except indicated premedication taxane . However , topical steroid inhale corticosteroid steroid dose of≤10 mg prednisone daily equivalent permit . Is schedule receive bone marrow transplantation and/or stem cell rescue course cisplatin therapy . Has receive investigational drug within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) prior receive first dose study medication , and/or schedule receive investigational drug study . Has receive moderately and/or highly emetogenic medication within 48 hour prior first dose study medication . ( Opioid narcotic cancer pain permit subject medication least 7 day experience nausea emesis narcotic . ) Has taken/received medication know potential antiemetic activity within 24hour period prior receive study drug . This include , limit : 5HT3 receptor antagonist ( e.g. , ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron , tropisetron , ramosetron ) .
