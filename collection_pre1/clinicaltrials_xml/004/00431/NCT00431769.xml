	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Bortezomib Re-treatment Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Open-Label ( people know identity intervention ) , non-randomized , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , single arm study evaluate safety efficacy bortezomib participant multiple myeloma ( cancer type cell normally find bone marrow ) previously respond bortezomib base therapy . Participants non-randomly assign single group bortezomib . Participants treat bortezomib alone combination another drug ( dexamethasone ) . Bortezomib give intravenously ( i.v . [ vein ] ) twice Weekly , Days 1 , 4 , 8 11 cycle follow 10-day ( Days 12 21 ) rest period . The total duration treatment period 8 cycle , last 3 week . The initial bortezomib dose last tolerate dose ( 1.0 1.3 milligram per metersquare [ mg/ m^2 ] previous bortezomib-based treatment . Participants start study dose 1.0 mg/m^2 bortezomib tolerate dose well could dose escalated 1.3 mg/m^2 . Doses 1.3 mg/m^2 allow . A complete cycle comprise 4 dos bortezomib . Dexamethasone first introduce Cycles 1 5 ( i.e.dexamethasone introduce first time Cycles 6 8 ) . The median total dose dexamethasone receive per cycle range 120 mg ( cycle 7 ) 160 mg ( cycle 1 6 8 ) . Efficacy primarily assess determine Best Confirmed Response accord European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criterion . Participant 's safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant previously diagnose multiple myeloma base standard criterion measurable disease . Measurable disease secretory multiple myeloma define quantifiable serum Mprotein value ( generally , exclusively , great ( &gt; ) 1 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G Myeloma protein ( Mprotein ) &gt; 0.5 g/dL Ig A ) urine lightchain excretion equal ( = ) &gt; 200 milligram ( mg ) /24 hour Participant previously tolerate 1.0 1.3 mg/metersquare ( m^2 ) bortezomib alone combination agent complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) upon completion bortezomib therapy It great equal ( &gt; = ) 6 month since participant 's last bortezomibdose participant progressive disease ( PD ) prior response bortezomib PR participant relapse CR Participant life expectancy &gt; 3 month If female , participant either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control screen least 30 day completion last cycle Participant receive chemotherapy , radiotherapy , antibody , immunotherapy , experimental therapy treat multiple myeloma since last dose bortezomib . Note : participant could receive localized palliative radiotherapy complication due osteolytic bone lesion . Participants could receive steroid ( dexamethasone equivalent ) thalidomide interferon maintenance therapy since last dose bortezomib accord local standard care . In addition , participant could receive cumulative dose 160 mg dexamethasone equivalent emergency therapy within 4 week prior enrolment . Participants could receive high dose therapy/stem cell transplantation induction regimen contain bortezomib , PR CR observe bortezomib contain induction therapy Participant uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month enrolment New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , clinically significant pericardial disease , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormalities Participant poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol Participant another malignancy within past 5 year . Exceptions make follow treated active : basal cell nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma skin , cervical carcinoma situ International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics Stage 1 carcinoma cervix Patient uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease , within 6 month enrolment Female participant pregnant breast feeding . Confirmation participant pregnant establish negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test result obtain Screening period . Pregnancy test require post menopausal surgically sterilize woman .</criteria>
