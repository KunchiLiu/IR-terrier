	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis ARDS appear damage alveolar-capillary barrier , compose microvascular endothelium alveolar epithelium . This damage may occur direct indirect lung injury . The mechanism injury alveolar capillary barrier appear neutrophil-mediated injury , pro-inflammatory cytokine , ventilator-induced lung injury alveolar distention abnormality coagulation system . This result blood clot formation microcirculation lung . Thrombolytics dissolve blood clot result increase blood flow organ . This treatment may benefit ARDS patient , thus purpose study . Hardaway , et al.studied effect thrombolytic ARDS pig . The experimental group show improved oxygenation survival compare control . There bleed complication note therapy . Dr. Hardaway follow animal study phase I clinical trial involve 20 patient ARDS . The patient treat IV streptokinase urokinase . Nineteen 20 patient show increase PA02 thrombolytic therapy . There significant bleeding complication patient critically ill ventilator . We propose additional phase I pilot study evaluate effectiveness safety Tenecteplase treatment ARDS . Unlike fibrinolytics study disease state , Tenecteplase , fibrin specific increase resistance plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI-I ) great level available fibrinolytics . We choose experimental dose escalation trial design tenecteplase demonstrate initial safety trend Phase I acute ischemic stroke trial . The initial dose 0.1 mg/kg IV increase 0.2 mg/kg , 0.3 mg/kg , final cohort patient receive 0.4 mg/kg . Drug administration single dose bolus cohort . Advancement dose occur safety question previous cohort . We hope provide acceptable benefit risk ratio mortality ARDS approximately 30 - 60 % . All patient closely monitored change clot parameter sign bleed . Tenecteplase administer via peripheral IV describe package insert .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome With Tenecteplase : A Dose Escalation Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Treatment acute respiratory distress syndrome tenecteplase , dose escalation pilot study : phase I 2 . The study sample size 20 patient . The 20 patient divide 4 group 5 patient group cohort . The first cohort receive 0.1mg/kg tenecteplase bolus via peripheral IV describe package insert closely monitor safety efficacy . If adverse event associated tenecteplase , second cohort patient enrol receive 0.2 mg/kg tenecteplase IV bolus . If safety issue , proceed next cohort 0.3 mg/kg final cohort patient receive 0.4 mg/kg tenecteplase IV bolus . Advancement dose occur safety question previous cohort . 3 . Tenecteplase give bolus via peripheral IV describe package insert . 4 . Treatment initiate informed consent obtain &gt; 12 hr subcutaneous Heparin stop &gt; 12 hrs placement pulmonary artery catheter , central line arterial line . Only patient meet criterion ARDS ( see inclusion criterion ) consider study . 5 . Pretreatment assessment : We obtain informed consent , demographic data , physical examination medical history , vital sign , PT , PTT , INR , ABG , hemoglobin hematocrit , liver enzymes , cardiac enzyme , creatinine , fibrinogen , fibrin split product , platelet , urine pregnancy test , EKG , chest x-ray , cardiac profile Swan-Ganz catheter ventilator setting treatment begin . 6 . Assessment treatment : Blood sample take every 6 hour 24 hour analyzes PT , PTT , INR , fibrinogen , fibrin split product , platelet , hemoglobin , hematocrit . Arterial blood gas sample take hour 1 , 2 , 3 , every six hour 24 hour post-injection . Cardiac profile , vital sign ventilator setting monitor hour 1 , 2 , 3 , every six hour 24 hour post-infusion . Adverse event monitor every hour 24 hour . 7 . Follow-up assessment : 72 hour post treatment physical exam , vital sign , weight , adverse event , cardiac profile , ventilator setting , PT , PTT , INR , fibrinogen , fibrin split product , platelet , ABG , hemoglobin hematocrit , liver enzymes , cardiac enzyme , creatinine , EKG chest x-ray obtain . Thirty day post treatment physical exam , vital sign , weight , mortality , adverse event follow . 8 . Patients monitor sign clinical bleeding .</detailed_description>
