	<brief_title>Predicting Risk Cancer Barrett 's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) increase risk esophageal adenocarcinoma 40-125 fold high general population . However , current technique detect dysplasia observe abnormal p53 immunohistochemical stain accurate reliable method determine BE patient progress cancer . DNA hypermethylation epigenetic process occur promoter region certain gene , result suppression gene expression . Inactivation specific gene via hypermethylation highly associated cancer . The primary objective research determine whether DNA hypermethylation biomarker predict patient BE likely progress adenocarcinoma . Patients BE and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma undergo endoscopy Johns Hopkins Hospital comprise cohort subject . Gene hypermethylation assess perform methylation-specific PCR panel 8 cancer-related gene . Specific Aim 1 : To compare prevalence gene hypermethylation BE patient different grade dysplasia and/or adenocarcinoma , use archive specimen . Specific Aim 2 : To determine whether presence gene hypermethylation initial biopsy BE patient associated progression adenocarcinoma , use archive specimen . To compare gene hypermethylation currently available marker neoplastic progression . Specific Aim 3 : To determine whether methylated DNA BE and/or adenocarcinoma detected peripheral blood patient , compare methylation profile esophageal biopsy specimen peripheral blood sample take time prospectively enrol patient . If hypermethylation one gene detect early stage BE patient later progress adenocarcinoma , hypermethylation could use early predictor adenocarcinoma even pathologic change evident . Furthermore , research help determine specific genetic event occur neoplastic transformation BE adenocarcinoma . The long-term goal project determine whether hypermethylation identify BE patient high risk neoplastic progression , thus allow early intervention form frequent endoscopic surveillance , chemoprevention , ablative therapy , surgery .</detailed_description>
