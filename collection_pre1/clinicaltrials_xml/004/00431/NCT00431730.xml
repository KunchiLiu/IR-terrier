	<brief_summary>Habitual smoking associate increase risk coronary artery disease , cerebral peripheral vascular disease , include ocular disease like age-related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy . Data recent study perform investigator lab reveal abnormal choroidal blood flow regulation chronic smoker compare age-matched non-smoking subject isometric exercise . However , information yet available regulation retinal vascular tone habitual smoker . Thus , current study , investigator set investigate whether regulation retinal vessel diameter affect habitual smoker . It show several report stimulation diffuse luminance flicker , increase retinal arterial venous diameter , indicate ability retina adapt change metabolic demand . In current study use effect tool investigate whether flicker induce vasodilatation affect habitual smoker . This would indicate impaired vascular regulation process smoker .</brief_summary>
