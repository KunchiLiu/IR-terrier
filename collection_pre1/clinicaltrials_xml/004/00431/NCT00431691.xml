	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress , refers cellular damage cause reactive oxygen intermediate , implicate many disease process , especially age-related disorder . Many trial investigate use antioxidant protect different tissue oxidative stress conduct , result ambiguous . Inflammation generally associate enhanced oxidative stress widespread endothelial dysfunction . In present study , infusion LPS , cell wall component Gram-negative bacteria major mediator pathogenesis septic shock , use standardized experimental model systemic inflammatory response human . The assessment outcome parameter include measurement ocular blood flow , forearm blood flow plasma concentration cytokine . Measurements ocular hemodynamics provide unique chance investigate local blood flow human non-invasively . Moreover , retina especially susceptible oxidative stress high consumption oxygen , high polyunsaturated fatty acid content , exposure visible light . Evidence literature clearly support role oxidative stress pathophysiology several ocular disease include diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration . To investigate retinal vascular reactivity use systemic hyperoxia stimulus . The measurement forearm blood flow use assess endothelial function . The main study objective investigate effect oral vitamin mineral supplementation impair retinal vascular reactivity LPS administration .</brief_summary>
