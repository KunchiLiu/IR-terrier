	<brief_title>Peginesatide Maintenance Treatment Anemia Participants Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia associate chronic kidney disease due several factor , primarily inability diseased kidney produce adequate amount endogenous erythropoietin . Ancillary factor include shorten lifespan red blood cell , iron nutritional deficiency , infection , inflammation . The presence severity anemia related duration extent kidney failure . Anemia associate increased mortality , increase likelihood hospitalization , reduce cognitive function , increase leave ventricular hypertrophy heart failure . Erythropoiesis stimulate agent establish treatment anemia subject chronic kidney disease , improved management anemia alternative transfusion . Peginesatide parenteral formulation develop treatment anemia associate chronic kidney disease . Peginesatide bind activate human erythropoietin receptor , stimulate erythropoiesis human red cell precursor manner similar know erythropoiesis-stimulating agent . Six dose cohort 15 participant evaluate study . Participants receive peginesatide injection every 4 week administer intravenously subcutaneously total 7 dos .</detailed_description>
