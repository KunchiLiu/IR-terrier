	<brief_summary>This study different technique treatment atrial fibrillation use procedure call radiofrequency catheter ablation . Atrial fibrillation ( call AF ) upper chamber heart ( atrium ) beat much fast low chamber , cause heart beat less effectively . AF cause stroke , impaired performance , palpitation , shortness breath , pass symptom . Radiofrequency ablation involve placement catheter/electrode wire heart plastic tube insert vein / artery groin right side neck local anesthesia . Radiofrequency energy deliver area inside heart cause rapid fire atrium , cause small lesion `` burn '' destroy heart tissue extra electrical impulse come . Commonly area four pulmonary vein ( PV ) deliver blood lung leave side heart , procedure also refer `` pulmonary vein isolation '' PVI . This study compare two different strategy perform pulmonary vein isolation procedure , compare effect use two different type radiofrequency ablation catheter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Usually 4-5 PVs person bring blood form different lobe lung LA . Typically inside line LA extend 3-7 mm inside PVs around entire circumference connect ( ostium ; o ) form finger like projection . These projection think site initiate AF . The procedure involve careful definition finger like projection LA PV o use circular mapping catheter ( Lasso ) . The connection produce specific pattern electrical recording target use ablation catheter utilizes radio-frequency energy create local burn point contact inside heart . A successful burn destroy finger-like projection appreciate loss characteristic electrical recording see pre-ablation . Using technique , series radiofrequency ablation lesion deliver around circumference PV , end point obliteration electrical recording leave atrium PV interest ( also call `` Electrical Isolation '' PV rest LA ) . At time ablation procedure AF involve electrical isolation either PVs show site AF start ( arrhythmogenic PV ) empirically isolate PVs patient ( typically 4-5 ) . There lack data show benefit one technique . Additionally , order create radiofrequency lesion burn inside heart , two different catheter technology approve currently use : 1 ) radiofrequency delivery use standard 4-mm tip 8-mm tip catheter , create burn point catheter contact approximately 5 mm deep 2 ) delivery radiofrequency energy via saline irrigate cool tip catheter capable create deeper burn ( 5 - 10 mm ) . Once , electrical isolation pulmonic vein pts AF , data prof benefit either catheter technology . PURPOSE AND DURATION : The objective propose research project study : - The effectiveness electrical isolation arrhythmogenic pulmonic vein ( PV ; partial isolation ) vs. electrical isolation empirically 4 PV ( total isolation ) long-term ( 1 year ) control Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) - The effectiveness close loop saline irrigate cool tip ablation catheter compare standard 4-mm tip 8-mm tip ablation catheter achieve successful electrical isolation pulmonic vein ( ) . Study participant shall 1:1 chance get either ablation 4 PVs vs. PVs show start AF also creation radiofrequency ablation 1:1 chance enrol either arm utilizes standard catheter vs. utilizes saline irrigate cool tip catheter . The duration participation study maximum 12 month . This trial conduct approximately 300 patient . Hypothesis : Total electrical isolation 4 PVs compare electrical isolation PV ( ) abnormal impulse find efficacious achieve long-term cure patient undergoing ablation AF . Furthermore , saline irrigate cool tip catheter able accomplish successful EI PV ( ) either group lesser number lesion compare standard 4-mm tip 8-mm tip ablation catheter .</detailed_description>
