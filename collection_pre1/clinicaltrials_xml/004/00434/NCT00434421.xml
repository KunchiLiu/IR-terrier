	<detailed_description>The prevalence asthma dramatically increase many part world . Currently , effective way prevent development allergic rhinitis asthma cure . Sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) , type therapy allergen place tongue , may way control possibly prevent allergic rhinitis asthma . However , detailed research approach limit . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability sublingual cockroach extract give people perennial allergic rhinitis . Participants study include people without asthma . Participation study last little 2 week . Participants stratify age ( old youngest age group ) degree cockroach sensitivity . Each age group enrol previous group 's safety data review . At study entry ( Day 0 ) , participant receive dose placebo seven incremental dos cockroach extract 15-minute interval observe clinic nurse . Doses continue give sign symptom occur indicate participant difficulty tolerate drug , maximum study dose reach . At Principal Investigator 's discretion , participant able achieve maximum study dose invite continue onto 2-week treatment course study . These participant return Days 1 2 clinic self-administer maximum study dose cockroach extract . After self-administering maximum study dose , participant observe clinic nurse 30 minute . On Days 3 14 , participant take maximum study dose cockroach extract daily home . Participants ask keep diary record sign symptom experience take dose . Skin test , breathe test , blood collection occur study screening . At study entry , participant teach use EpiPen event severe allergic reaction time study . A physical exam/fitness assessment do study screening , study entry , final visit . Unused extract collect final visit participant enter 2-week treatment course study .
