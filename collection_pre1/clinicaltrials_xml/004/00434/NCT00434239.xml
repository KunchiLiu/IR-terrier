	<detailed_description>Aim : The primary objective ass safety Revlimid combination Ancestim patient symptomatic myelodysplasia . The secondary objective : Duration response assessment change gene expression profile bone marrow sample patient undergoing treatment . Potential Significance : Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) malignant hematopoietic stem cell disorder . Prognosis estimate use International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) divide patient low , intermediate-1 , intermediate-2 , high-risk group correspond median survival time 5.7 year , 3.5 year , 1.2 year , 0.4 year , respectively . There currently standard treatment MDS management often purely symptomatic transfusion blood product antibiotic treatment infection . A recent phase II study however show significant response rate Revlimid single agent patient MDS . The total response rate 56 % . The effect Revlimid SCF hematopoietic progenitor cell examine vitro . RhSCF Revlimid show synergistic stimulating proliferation hematopoietic progenitor cell precursor vitro , thereby form rationale study . Research Plan : This single-centre , open label , single-arm , non-comparative study , 25 patient enrol . The study include patient meet inclusion none exclusion criterion , per respective protocol section . The patient enrol sequentially receive 2 different dose level Ancestim fix dose Revlimid . This determine feasibility tolerability combination Revlimid Ancestim . Patients start 8 week course single agent Revlimid 10mg daily oral treatment day 1-21 28 day cycle . If patient achieve complete remission single agent Revlimid start Ancestim s.c. injection . Two dose level Ancestim ( 10 20 mcg/kg s.c. daily 7 day ) evaluate . Safety : Safety assess report adverse event ( start first study-related procedure , treatment , period 60 day follow discontinuation treatment ) . The intensity adverse event assess use National Cancer Institute common toxicity criterion . All adverse event record case report form ( CRFs ) . Furthermore , assessment physical ( include neurological / peripheral neurological ) examination , vital sign measurement , haematology clinical chemistry test use monitor safety . Clinically relevant change laboratory safety test , vital sign , physical examination record adverse event . The adverse event section CRFs submit representative sponsor end treatment cycle . Serious adverse event report occur , form provide sponsor . Efficacy : Response treatment assess accord guideline international work group standardize response criterion myelodysplastic syndrome . This do bone marrow biopsy ( include cytogenetic analysis ) peripheral blood count . An additional scientific investigation examine gene-expression profile bone-marrow blood sample different time point try correlate response treatment . Concomitant in-vitro study assess surrogate marker response . Statistical Methods : Adverse event , serious adverse event , transfusion requirement , response data Karnofsky performance status data summarize .</detailed_description>

Patients must confirm myelodysplastic syndrome regardless subgroup accord WHO classification prognostic group . Patients treatment associate MDS allow study , however number restrict 10 ( 50 % patient anticipated receive combination treatment ) . Patients CMML eligible restrict number 3 total . 5 . The patient must either : 1. symptomatic anemia define Hb &lt; 10g/dl OR 2. transfusiondependent anaemia define require 4 unit pack red blood cell 8 week 6 . All previous cancer therapy , include erythropoietin , thalidomide experimental therapy must discontinue least 4 week prior treatment study . 1 . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . 2 . Pregnant lactating female . 3 .
