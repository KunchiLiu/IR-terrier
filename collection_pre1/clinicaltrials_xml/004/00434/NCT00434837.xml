	<brief_title>Initial Graft Tension ACL Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Damage ACL common injury usually require surgical reconstruction restore function prevent progression post-traumatic osteoarthritis . However , reconstruction procedure frequently cause degenerative change knee joint time . The amount tension apply ACL reconstruction may indirectly affect possible onset arthritis time . High tension would result less joint motion initial healing stage , may make onset arthritis less likely . On hand , high tension would result increased compressive force joint surface , could lead arthritis . The purpose study evaluate effect initial graft tension set ACL reconstruction surgery joint cartilage development knee arthritis least 12-year period . Participants include candidate ACL reconstruction surgery use patellar tendon graft . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group : - Low tension ( Group 1 ) participant receive low-tension treatment initial graft tension set anterior-posterior ( A-P ) displacement reconstruct knee equal uninjured knee . - High-tension ( Group 2 ) participant receive high-tension treatment initial graft tension set reduce A-P displacement 2 millimeter relative uninjured knee . Participants enroll 12-year study 1 6 week prior ACL surgery . There two preoperative study visit : one include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) include knee evaluation , dynamic function testing , questionnaire . Postoperative visit occur immediately follow surgery 6 , 12 , 36 , 60 , 84 , 120 144 month follow surgery . Strength test , functional testing , x-rays , questionnaire , knee exam occur postoperative visit . MRIs occur postoperative visit . An additional group participant evidence knee injury serve control . The control group attend study visit except 12-month visit . All participant may follow 10 year .</detailed_description>
