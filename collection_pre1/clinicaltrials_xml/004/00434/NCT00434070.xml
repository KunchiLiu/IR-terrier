	<brief_summary>This study examine whether HIV-infected patient likely develop resistance antiretroviral therapy blood monitor number virus ( viral load ) body . A virus change ( mutates ) time may become resistant certain type medicine . This resistance may affect future treatment option . This study compare amount virus blood HIV-infected patient monitor viral load amount virus blood patient monitor viral load . For patient detectable virus , type resistance ( mutation ) virus determine compare component virus virus know resistant . HIV-infected patient 18 year age older treat Infectious Diseases Institute Mulago Hospital Makerere University Kampala , Uganda , may eligible study . Participants interview treatment receive HIV usually take anti-HIV drug . They also blood sample drawn research test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Viral Resistance Development CD4 Monitoring Alone With Viral Load Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) become widely available resource limit setting ( RLS ) due large increase available resource President Emergency Plan AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) Global Fund AIDS , Tuberculosis , Malaria ( GFATM ) . The number people access ART RLS double 2005 alone . Whereas viral load test do routinely individual ART western hemisphere , case elsewhere . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend clinical CD4 count monitor standard care RLS ART scale-up . As result , grow population individual Africa currently ART whose treatment monitor use clinical evaluation CD4 count . In addition preserve life improve quality life HIV infected individual , goal ART achieve maintain suppression HIV replication undetectable level . This goal enable treatment remain effective long term since emergence resistant strain limit low replication rate HIV achieve condition . The recovery immune system determine CD4 count monitor neither sensitive specific marker virological suppression individual ART . Therefore , monitor response ART use WHO guideline RLS may lead significant delay detect failure achieve maintain virological suppression among individual fail treatment . This contrast western setting routine viral load test lead early detection failure achieve suppression . Failure monitor detect unsuppressed virus increase risk development resistance ART . In particular , failure achieve maintain virologic suppression prolong period time may lead sequential development thymidine analogue mutation ( TAMs ) patient take zidovudine ( AZT ) stavudine ( d4T ) part ART regimens . The accumulation 3 4 TAMs confers drug resistance across nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) class antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug implication future ART regimen , particularly RLS second line ART option limit . Stavudine zidovudine currently use part first line regimens Sub-Saharan Africa RLS area . We hypothesize patient monitor combination CD4 count viral load measurement routinely develop TAMs slow rate patient monitor CD4 count measurement ( per WHO guideline RLS ) . This hypothesis base high risk delay detection unsuppressed virus patient monitor clinical CD4 count alone , may translate development drug-resistant mutation . The study team therefore propose carry cross-sectional study large public HIV out-patient clinic patient routinely monitor CD4 count viral load measurement compare patient routinely monitor CD4 count measurement . Individuals detectable viral load 36 month ARV therapy patient category shall undergo structure interview HIV genotypic testing , particularly look TAMs . The presence TAMs instance shall document . The result study highlight magnitude risk use CD4 count monitoring patient ART RLS contribute effort find cheap technology virological monitoring individual . The finding also support choice second line drug regimen may propose use Africa .</detailed_description>
