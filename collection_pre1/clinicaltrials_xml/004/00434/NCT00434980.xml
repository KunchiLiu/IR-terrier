Cognitive deficit schizophrenia know contribute devastate functional impairment caregiver burden , client rely caregiver help basic living need , personal hygiene , time management , social skill , progress towards vocational educational goal . Specifically , 1 ) Develop manualized , family treatment program design improve adaptive functioning patient schizophrenia , 2 ) Conduct pilot feasibility study evaluate acceptability feasibility intervention , collect preliminary outcome data . This lay foundation control trial efficacy intervention . We expect : 1 . The FCA intervention well-received well-tolerated client family , demonstrate high level interest program , low rate attrition , high rate participant satisfaction . 2 . Client participant FCA intervention show improvement adaptive , independent-living skill ( e.g. , personal hygiene self-care , medication management , time management , social skill , responsibility health maintenance ) maintain three six month follow completion intervention . 3 .

	<detailed_description>This open trial design evaluate feasibility new family intervention . Participants assess baseline , post-intervention , 3- 6-months follow completion intervention . A total 20 client diagnose schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , schizophreniform disorder family recruit Massachusetts General Hospital Freedom Trail Clinic Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) ( include , Massachusetts Mental Health Center BIDMC inpatient outpatient department ) . Clients family participate Family-Directed Cognitive Adaptation ( FCA ) intervention , include functional assessment , 16 single-family session 6 session monthly , multiple-family group . Follow-up assessment conduct clinical evaluator ( directly involve treatment ) end individual-family treatment 3 6 month follow completion treatment client relatives variety outcome measure specify ( time assessment may occasionally delay 1-4 week order accommodate schedule client family ) . Sessions audiotaped use development instrument measure therapist fidelity treatment model . Treatment Program . The FCA program design teach client family neurocognitive deficit associate schizophrenia , recommend specific compensatory strategy positive behavioral support manage deficit , teach family help client implement strategy order improve adaptive living skill . The FCA program begin comprehensive cognitive functional assessment client home environment order identify specific functional target intervention . This include : 1 ) neuropsychological assessment attention , process speed , memory executive functioning ; 2 ) assessment independent living skill ( e.g. , time management , groom , self-care ) ; 3 ) home assessment identify barrier adaptive function client 's home environment . Specific measure describe attached Appendix . Following cognitive functional assessment , client relative receive 16 individual-family session ( 14 weekly session 2 bi-weekly sessions—However , time session may vary bit accommodate schedule participant . We aim complete counseling session within 18-22 week ) , 6 session monthly , multifamily group ( 3-4 session concurrent individual session , 2-3 session serve maintenance group follow completion main , individual-family intervention ) . The individual session FCA program include : 1 ) general psychoeducation illness symptom cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia ( 4 session ) , 2 ) feedback session present result cognitive functional assessment , identification functional target intervention , 3 ) completion 2-3 module target specific deficit adaptive function identified evaluation . Most session conduct clinic client receive psychiatric treatment , 3-4 home visit also conduct facilitate modification home environment generalization compensatory skill . Sessions include client least one family member live client . The principal investigator serve clinician program along co-leader , serve member client 's clinical team . Data Be Recorded ( Measures ) . Clients participate relative assess clinical evaluator ( directly involve treatment ) via structure interview self-report instrument four time point , include baseline , completion individual-family intervention , 3 6 month follow completion intervention . ( Timing assessment may vary bit accommodate schedule participant . Therefore , follow-up one take place within 2 week end 16 session program , follow-up two take place 12-14 week , follow-up three take place 12-14 week third follow-up . ) Client measure . Baseline measure include assessment psychiatric diagnosis ( SCID , chart review , collateral information gather client 's treat clinician relative ) general demographic information . Clients also undergo neuropsychological evaluation baseline . This evaluation consist MATRICS Provisional Consensus Cognitive Battery Phase II . A brief selection measure battery repeat post-intervention assessment . Detailed description measure copy measure include Appendix . Assessments time point ( baseline , post-intervention , 3- 6-month follow-up ) include measure symptom ( Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ) , adaptive living skill function ( Social Adaptive Functions Scale , Independent Living Skills Survey , Multnomah Community Ability Scale , The Independent Living Self-Care Skills Checklist , Global Assessment Functioning ) , behavior relate cognitive functioning ( Clinical Global Impression Cognition Schizophrenia , Frontal Lobe Personality Scale—Patient Version ) , degree patient perceive relative critical ( Interpersonal Affectivity Scale ) . Furthermore , chart review conduct record inpatient hospitalization occur study period number day spend hospital . Family member measure . Baseline measure include general demographic information ( age , ethnicity , level education , etc ) . All assessment include measure negative attitude towards client ( Patient Rejection Scale , Interpersonal Affectivity Scale ) , perceive burden ( Burden Assessment Scale ) , time spent caregiving activity caregiving expense ( Family Resources Interview ) , knowledge schizophrenia cognitive deficit ( Modified Schizophrenia Knowledge Scale ) , caregiving self-efficacy ( Family Self-Efficacy Scale ) , positive aspect caregiving ( Gratifications Benefits Caregiving Questionnaire ) psychological distress ( Beck Anxiety Depression Scales ) . In addition , relatives ask provide collateral information client 's adaptive living skill ( use `` Informant Version '' Independent Living Skills Survey Independent Living Self-Care Skills Checklist ) cognitive function ( Clinical Global Impression Cognition Schizophrenia , Frontal Lobe Personality Scale—Family Version ) . Additional measure . Clients relatives complete adapted measure satisfaction program ( Satisfaction Questionnaire ) ask report aspect find helpful whether able practice skill introduce . Therapist time spend deliver intervention record weekly basis . Notes session record `` Contact Summary '' form . Interest program measure keep track number referral program compare number family participate . In addition , document rate attendance .</detailed_description>
