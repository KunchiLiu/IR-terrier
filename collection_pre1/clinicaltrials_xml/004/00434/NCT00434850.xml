	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes , also know insulin-dependent diabetes , chronic disease pancreas produce insufficient insulin properly regulate blood sugar level . Hypoglycemia , low blood sugar , hyperglycemia , high blood sugar , lead significant complication people type 1 diabetes . Intensive insulin therapy show reduce risk chronic complication people achieve near normalization glycemia . However , therapy labor intensive , difficult implement , associate increased frequency severe hypoglycemia . Transplantation islets healthy pancreas successful restore normal blood sugar level lead initial insulin independence people type 1 diabetes . Rejection islets recipient 's immune system , however , make treatment ineffective within couple year . Immunosuppressant drug may effective way maintain islet function post-transplant . The purpose study assess safety efficacy immunosuppressive regimen include DSG post-transplant islet function people type 1 diabetes respond intensive insulin therapy . The study also seek improve understanding determinant success failure islet transplant type 1 diabetes . Following screening procedure 2 day prior islet transplant , participant randomly assign either Phase 2 trial multicenter Phase 3 trial . Participants study receive three separate islet transplant . They begin receive antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) sirolimus 2 day prior first islet transplant . ATG continue give Day 2 post-transplant . Participants continue take sirolimus duration study . On day transplant , participant receive DSG etanercept , addition ATG sirolimus . The DSG infusion administer 3 hour immediately precede islet transplant . Participants continue receive daily 3-hour infusion DSG Day 6 post-transplant . Etanercept also administer Days 3 , 7 , 10 post-transplant . Tacrolimus administer Day 1 post-transplant continue throughout study . Transplantations involve inpatient hospital stay infusion islet branch portal vein . Participants achieve maintain insulin independence Day 75 post-transplant consider second islet transplant . Participants remain dependent insulin longer 1 month second transplant show partial graft function consider third transplant . Daclizumab basiliximab use place ATG second third transplant , necessary . Participants meet criterion subsequent transplant function graft enter reduce follow-up period . There 21 study visit follow transplant . A physical exam , review adverse event , blood collection , urine test , measure immunosuppression level occur visit . An abdominal ultrasound glomerular filtration rate test occur study visit . Participants also self-test glucose level least five time per day throughout study . A 12-month follow-up period take place participant 's last transplant .</detailed_description>
