	<detailed_description>Up fully functional precise technique accurate assessment monitoring degree unconsciousness general anaesthesia . Previous study result obtain project regard effect anaesthetic single neuron small neuronal network indicate would promise use method directly correlate integrity relevant functional system . As one goal project formulate develop test new system record analysis mid latency auditory evoke potential ( MLAEP ) , suitable use clinical surround operation theatre . Step step investigational system develop , obtain legal approvement functional broad spectrum case . In multicenter study include 4 clinical centre 426 patient reliability system prove . Even hard condition OR apparatus able record signal sufficient reliability precision . A clear correlation MLAEP parameter clinically define state consciousness could identify . Differences effect use combination general anaesthetic opioids identify . An algorithm automatic analysis signal develop , allow user limit knowledge interpretation MLAEP signal use monitor anaesthesia .</detailed_description>
