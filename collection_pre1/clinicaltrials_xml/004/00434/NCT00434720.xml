	<brief_summary>The GlideScope video laryngoscope ( Verathon ) intubate device us high-resolution camera embed plastic laryngoscope blade . An LED provide illumination . The GlideScope often provide good laryngoscopic view , pass endotracheal tube ( ETT ) vocal cord sometimes difficult . Because 60 degree anterior curvature GlideScope 's blade , ETT 's must stylets inserted ETT distal tip position anteriorly . Various author recommend different angle ETT optimally place trachea . Previous study demonstrate 90 degree sharp bend faster subjectively easier heterogeneous group intubators . With introduction rigid GlideScope Specific Stylet manufacturer , question arises best configuration stylet ETT . Therefore , prospective , randomize , single-blinded trial propose . The null hypothesis difference GlideScope Specific Stylet standard malleable stylet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine optimum angle curvature endotracheal tube use GlideScope order intubate efficient fashion . Methods : Groups : A ) 90º curvature , malleable stylet B ) shallow curvature , rigid GlideScope Specific Stylet Hypothesis : The null hypothesis difference primary outcome ( time intubation ) . i.e . hypothesize time intubate relate shape endotracheal tube . The control group arbitrarily assign 90º group prefer option previous trial . Primary Endpoint : 1 ) Time intubation ( second ) . Written inform consent obtain one study investigator , copy give participant . Written inform consent also obtain operator GlideScope . After consent , randomization occur select next consecutive envelope . There three distinct anesthesia provider involve conduct study , follow : 1 . `` operator '' - person perform intubation 2 . `` timer '' - person time outcome ( one co-investigators ) 3 . `` shaper '' - person ensure angle stylet tube match group patient allocate Because person intubate must blind time tube use , unopened envelope take third anesthesia provider , prepare ETT stylet area visible person perform intubation person time intubation . The person perform intubation specify size tube wish use . This commonly 7.5 mm internal diameter ( ID ) female 8.0 ID male , operator free use whatever size feel appropriate . The tube size selection take place unblinding group allocation affect decision tube size . `` Group A '' ETT 's shape aid standard malleable stylet ( Rusch 14 Fr ) lubricate single-use water-soluble lubricant . `` Group B '' ETT 's instrumented GlideScope Specific Stylet , identical lubricant . The prepared tube conceal standard green OR towel bring operating room ( OR ) . This tube place close patient 's head readily accessible . Data Collection In OR , GlideScope turn least 60 use prevent fogging . The patient care usual fashion respect monitor induction general anesthesia . Muscle relaxation use , agent use discretion operator . After induction anesthesia , bag-mask ventilation use usual fashion operator decides proceed laryngoscopy GlideScope . The operator remain blind group allocation laryngoscopic view obtain GlideScope , upon hand endotracheal tube . The timer ( see tube green towel ) watch operator GlideScope patient 's mouth , start timer , turn 180º face anesthetic monitor . The timer able see ETT , stylet , curvature face screen . Timing continue end-tidal CO2 least 30 mmHg see anesthesia monitor , point data collection form fill , study protocol finish . ( The time intubation record near tenth second . ) If operator fail intubate within 3 attempt 150 second , intubation note failure , ultimately successful mean secure airway record . If oxygen desaturation ( record pulse oximetry ) 95 % occurs , patient ventilate usual fashion ensure oxygenation , re-attempting intubation use GlideScope may proceed , time continue , limit successful intubation ( within 3 attempt total 150s ) apply . Between attempt , tube may re-shaped operator malleable stylet use either original curvature lose operator feel another curvature would prefer . Discontinuation Criteria If oxygen saturation fall 90 % occurs point , protocol stop immediately , management proceed normal fashion discretion attend anesthesiologist , could involve immediate intubation use GlideScope intubation device , ventilation use mask laryngeal mask airway . If , time , attend anesthesiologist believe risk patient study protocol , protocol terminate normal anesthetic care continue .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any adult patient schedule elective surgery . ETT indicate procedure opinion attend anesthesiologist . operator perform ≥ 10 GlideScope intubation . GlideScope contraindicate opinion attend anesthesiologist . know cervical spine abnormality . know probable difficult airway . rapid sequence induction .</criteria>
