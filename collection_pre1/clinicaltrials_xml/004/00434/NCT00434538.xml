	<brief_title>BST-DERMON Versus Standard Care Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial design investigate therapeutic benefit use BST-DermOn wound repair diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer . BST-DermOn sterile , non-toxic , nonpyrogenic wound dress compose aqueous mixture Chitosan , hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) disodium beta-glycerol phosphate ( β-GP ) design address current wound healing need . Chitosan well document wound heal property well inherent haemostatic bacteriostatic capability . BST-DermOn used conjunction define standard care apply prepared debrided ulcer cover semi-occlusive secondary dressing . This prospective , multi-center , randomize , control study enrol 130 type 1 type 2 diabetic subject present Grade 1 Grade 2 ( Wagner classification ) diabetic foot ulcer 1-10cm² mid forefoot . Subjects meet eligibility criterion assign one two group : 1. control group receive standard care 2. treatment group receive BST-DermOn . Treatments group apply three ( 3 ) time week twenty consecutive week study ulcer close . All subject follow safety efficacy treatment visit final evaluation visit . There post treatment follow-up visit 4 week post-closure subject complete re-epithelialization . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy BST-DermOn provide clinically significant advantage standard care repair diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>
