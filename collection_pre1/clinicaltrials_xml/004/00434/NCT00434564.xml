	<brief_summary>Objective 1 . To compare incidence adverse cardiac event among patient discharge evaluation ACTION protocol conventional protocol . The adverse cardiac event follow-up defined following : - Cardiac relate death - Ventricular fibrillation - Myocardial infarction - Cardiogenic shock require inta-aortic balloon pump circulatory assistance - Acute pulmonary oedema require endo-tracheal intubation 2 . To study sensitivity / predictive value various component ACTION :12 lead ECG ST monitoring , serial serum marker myocardial necrosis ( myoglobin , CKMB , TnT , grade exercise testing , stress tetrofosmin scan/ stress echocardiography ) predict adverse cardiac event . Design -prospective randomise clinical trial Participants -patients 25 year age present ED chest pain consistent myocardial ischaemia 12 lead ECG non-diagnostic myocardial ischaemia . Intervention Patients monitor continuously 12 lead ECG ST segment trend monitoring blood drawn 0,3,6 hour arrival ED serial myoglobin , creatine kinase MB isoenzyme ( CKMB ) Troponin T ( TnT ) . Patients ECG blood test consistent myocardial necrosis admit CCU . A senior doctor ED review patient admit 6 hour observation . Study Group A stress tetrofosmin nuclear scan do . Patients admit discharged depend result stress tetrofosmin scan . Control group ( conventional protocol ) Patients admit discharged discretion senior ED doctor . Measurement Patients follow 1 week , 2 week , one month six month adverse cardiac event cardiac relate death , ventricular fibrillation , myocardial infarction . Statistical analysis Logistic regression analysis use compare proportion adverse event two treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Chest Pain Treatment Evaluation ( ACTION ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Identifying cause chest pain challenge Emergency Physician.Coronary artery disease common group Emergencies high potential rapidly develop lethal outcome . Significant proportion patient present released Emergency Department ( ED ) AMI unstable angina develop poor outcome . This large proportion AMI present atypically.The initial single 12 lead ECG do ED 50 % sensitive AMI.Serial ECGs show improve sensitivity 25 % .Because limitation , physician may admit patient chest pain , liberally . On hand 25-50 % patient admit CCU without AMI eventually determine Acute Coronary Syndrome . Several serum cardiac marker myoglobulin , CKMB Troponin T ( TnT ) find increase sensitivity detect AMI history ECG . Among TnT well predictor adverse cardiac event CKMB . Absence TnT elevation identifies low risk group patient , necessarily low risk group since TnT detect myocardial ischaemia absence myocardial injury myocyte cell death . There chest pain evaluation practice ED use graded exercise test screen severe ischaemia . Several study suggest safety exercise test low risk patient present ED chest pain.The use exercise test find powerful tool prognostication . Stress nuclear imaging also perform end 6 hour observation instead grade exercise stress test alone . There significant proportion patient eligible standard exercise treadmill stress test due poor exercise tolerance . Even underwent exercise testing , study show 24.2 % inconclusive baseline ECG abnormality ( leave ventricular hypertrophy , leave bundle-branch block patient digoxin ) . Some patient may able achieve require exercise level . Studies show mean sensitivity specificity grade exercise test detect severe coronary artery disease 68 77 % respectively . The sensitivity grade exercise test detect single vessel disease lower . Stress nuclear image valuable establish prognosis patient low likelihood coronary artery disease . Stress nuclear scan additive prognostic value grade exercise test especially latter abnormal non-diagnostic.For exercise , pharmacological stress tetrofosmin dobutamine adenosine perform instead . The efficacy acute chest pain evaluation centre compare conventional protocol prospective randomise clinical trial . Aims 1 . To compare incidence adverse cardiac event among patient discharge evaluation ACTION conventional protocol . Adverse cardiac event define follow : ) Cardiac relate death ii ) Ventricular fibrillation iii ) Myocardial infarction iv ) Cardiogenic shock require intra-aortic balloon pump circulatory assistance v ) Acute pulmonary oedema require endotracheal intubation 2 . To study sensitivity specificity grade exercise test , stress tetrofosmin scan predict adverse cardiac event 5 . Treatment Plan First 6 hour Once inform consent obtain , patient enrol . They put continuous ECG monitoring . Ten mls blood drawn 0,3,6 hour arrival ED myoglobin , CKMB TnT analysis . Blood LDL &amp; HDL also draw 0 hour well cardiac marker . The old hospital case record patient , available , retrieve previous ECG 's also compare new ECG . Patients develop recur chest pain consistent myocardial ischaemia , ST segment elevation depression continuous 12 lead ECG monitoring indicate myocardial necrosis , positive CKMB ( &gt; 5 ) , Troponin T ( &gt; 0.01 ) , admit Department Cardiology . If patient admit end 6 hour , he/she review ED Registrar/Associate Consultant/Consultant . The senior ED doctor review patient , his/ 12 lead ECGs blood result serum marker myocardial necrosis . After first 6 hour - Study Group ( Intervention Protocol ) The patient underwent stress tetrofosmin scan within 24 hour presentation ( exercise pharmacological stress exercise ) . Tetrofosmin scan do NHC Department Nuclear Medicine , SGH . Patients monitor test complete . If stress tetrofosmin scan turn positive , patient admit hospital management . If stress tetrofosmin scan negative , patient release ED instruction follow-up cardiology clinic outpatient . Control Group ( conventional protocol ) The patient high intermediate risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) define Agency HealthCare Policy Research guideline Unstable Angina admit . The indicator coronary artery disease definite angina , T wave inversion &gt; 1 mm lead dominant R wave diabetes . If doubt , patient also admit . Patients discharge ED review cardiologist NHC cardiac clinic within two week . 6 . Follow Up Patients follow one month , six month one year primary secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
