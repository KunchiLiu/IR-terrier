	<brief_summary>This study examine whether epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , major component green tea , affect body respond insulin healthy obese people . Insulin effective people overweight , high blood pressure diabetes . This condition know insulin resistance . Laboratory study suggest green tea EGCG treatment lower blood pressure , lower blood sugar increase blood flow . This study see EGCG improve insulin resistance insulin 's effect blood flow people insulin resistance . Healthy normal weight overweight people 21 65 year age may eligible study . Participants randomly assign take EGCG placebo ( inactive dummy pill ) two 4-week treatment phase 2-week period study medication treatment phase . After first 4-week treatment , patient placebo switch EGCG EGCG switch placebo . In addition treatment , participant undergo follow procedure study period : - Screening , include medical history , physical examination blood urine test , finger-stick blood sugar measurement patient diabetes - Complete dietary physical activity questionnaire consult dietitian - Blood urine test - At-home clinic blood pressure monitor - Glucose clamp test measure body respond insulin . This test do three time study . A needle place vein subject 's arm , one sampling blood infuse insulin , glucose potassium . Glucose insulin level , electrolyte , lipid , fatty acid , cytokine epicatechin measure . - Forearm blood flow measurement microbubbles ultrasound . Before begin glucose clamp test , test well blood vessel relax do . A device measure size artery upper arm place elbow . Blood flow muscle forearm measure ultrasound use small infusion vein microbubble contrast agent consist gas-filled bubble size red blood cell . The contrast agent infuse 7- 9-minute period begin glucose clamp test 2 hour begin test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Green tea functional food whose consumption associate improved cardiovascular morbidity mortality several large epidemiological study . One third solid green tea compose bioactive polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate ( EGCG ) . Studies cell- animal-based model ( lab elsewhere ) suggest EGCG may mimic and/or augment beneficial metabolic , vascular , anti-inflammatory action insulin . Indeed , recently show 3-week EGCG therapy SHR rat ( genetic model hypertension feature human metabolic syndrome include insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , endothelial dysfunction , overweight ) lower blood pressure , improve endothelial dysfunction , increase insulin sensitivity , raise adiponectin level nearly effectively treatment conventional ACE-inhibitor enalapril . Obesity , type 2 diabetes , hypertension important interrelate public health problem characterize reciprocal relationship insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction . Thus , therapy disease improve insulin resistance often simultaneously improve endothelial function vice versa . Based result cellular , physiological , epidemiological study , hypothesize oral EGCG administration simultaneously ameliorate insulin resistance lower blood pressure human subject obesity . To test hypothesis , conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , cross-over study evaluate potential beneficial effect EGCG modulate insulin sensitivity , blood pressure , vascular function , inflammatory marker two group subject ( lean healthy control , obesity ) . After 2-week EGCG-free run-in period , subject randomize receive EGCG placebo capsule ( 400 mg p.o . B.I.D . ) 4 week . This follow 2-week EGCG-free washout period subject cross-over treatment arm . At baseline , 4-week treatment period , assess insulin sensitivity ( hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp technique ) vascular function . Regarding vascular function , measure basal insulin-stimulated brachial artery blood flow ( large conduit artery assess Doppler ultrasound ) well capillary recruitment forearm skeletal muscle ( small nutritive arteriole assess ultrasound microbubble contrast ) . Blood pressure measure weekly UMB GCRC throughout duration study . EGCG pharmacokinetics measure begin glucose clamp study day oral administration single dose EGCG placebo . Finally , various plasma marker inflammation measure baseline end treatment arm evaluate potential change may relate improvement metabolic and/or vascular function . This study explore whether EGCG , single compound think major bioactive component green tea , effective improve insulin resistance lower blood pressure subject obesity . Results study may important implication understand potential health benefit functional food contain bioactive polyphenols include green tea , dark chocolate , red wine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY SUBJECTS : Men woman good general health significant underlying illness age 2165 year age HbA ( 1C ) less 6.5 % , fast blood glucose le 100 mg/dL , blood pressure less 120/80 , BMI 2025 kg/m ( 2 ) . Subjects never smoke tobacco smoke within previous year . OBESE SUBJECTS : Men woman good general health significant underlying illness except obesity age 2165 year age HbA ( 1C ) less 6.5 % , fast blood glucose le 110 mg/dl , blood pressure less 140/90 , BMI 3040 kg/m ( 2 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ALL SUBJECTS : Subjects exclude study pregnant , breastfeed plan pregnancy prior end study . In addition , subject exclude age great 65 yr , BMI great equal 40 kg/m ( 2 ) , liver disease ( include liver transaminase level great twice upper limit normal ) , pulmonary disease , renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine great 2.0 mg/dl ) , coronary heart disease , heart failure ( New York Heart Association heart failure Class III IV ) , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathy , major depressive disorder , actively smoke use tobacco within last year , history cancer , treatment form cancer , positive test HIV , hepatitis B C , take systemic corticosteroid , thiazolidinediones ( within 3 month ) , insulin , anticoagulant , use food supplement discontinue , regular intake 8 cup tea per week within 3 month prior study entry , regular alcoholic beverage intake two drink per day ( drink corresponds approximately 12 ounce beer , 4 ounce table wine , 1 1.5 ounce 80proof spirit ) , poor compliance runin period regular use medication affect insulin sensitivity , blood pressure vascular function discontinue . In addition , history medical disease , laboratory abnormality , psychological condition would make subject ( base upon principal investigator 's judgment ) unsuitable study enrollment . Subjects know hypersensitivity octafluoropropane , recent eye surgery , know cardiac shunt also exclude participate potential adverse effect microbubble contrast agent . Subjects exclude unable give inform consent procedure . Currently , type 2 diabetes rare child , however child exclude study child typically take EGCG typically hypertension type 2 diabetes mellitus .</criteria>
