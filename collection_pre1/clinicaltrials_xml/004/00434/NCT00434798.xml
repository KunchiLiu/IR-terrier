	<brief_summary>The primary objective study establish human Campylobacter jejuni infection model follow characteristic : 1 . Safe application 1 . Infectious period risk mitigate close monitoring prospectively apply early treatment criterion 2 . Potential post-infectious sequela risk mitigate appropriate strain host selection 2 . Campylobacteriosis attack rate least 75 % Secondary objective determine humoral , cell-mediated , mucosal immune response newly establish human C. jejuni infection model evaluate short-term ( &lt; 3 mo ) protection upon repeat exposure homologous C. jejuni strain ass immune response associate protection .</brief_summary>
