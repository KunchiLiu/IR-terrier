	<detailed_description>Background : In order improve care patient , necessary research evidence translate clinical practice . There gap understand knowledge translation ( KT ) evident Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , specifically apply prevention , diagnosis treatment ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . VAP associate high burden illness critically ill extensive amount research evidence disease . It demonstrate best practice define research evidence uniformly apply VAP . In addition , recent advance VAP knowledge need disseminate implemented order improve patient safety outcomes VAP . A systematic process knowledge transfer crucial translate research evidence-based bedside practice development implementation evidence base Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPGs ) may facilitate VAP knowledge uptake . In addition , need study knowledge translation ( KT ) ICU since little information optimal KT CPG implementation strategy environment effort effective clinical area may result meaningful change ICU . Research Question : What effect VAP CPGs implement multidisciplinary behaviour change strategy ( consist multifaceted educational strategy lead local opinion leader augment reminder ) VAP guideline concordance clinical VAP outcomes ICU ? Research Plan : Data collect consecutive patient mechanically ventilate least 48 hour . The following health care professional study assess behaviour change strategy VAP CPGs : physician ( intensivists , ICU fellows , ICU rotate resident ) , nurse , respiratory therapist , dietician , physiotherapist ICU administrator . The study conduct 3 phase : 1 . Development behaviour change strategy consist three component : - Local opinion leader team - Educational strategy - Reminder system 2 . Prospective implementation behaviour change strategy 24 month period 3 . Prospective evaluation behaviour change strategy 24 month period - Concordance VAP guideline time - Factors associate VAP guideline concordance - Clinical VAP outcomes pre- post-guideline implementation</detailed_description>
