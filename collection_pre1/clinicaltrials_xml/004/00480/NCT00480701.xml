	<brief_title>Evaluation 123-I Iodobenzovesamicol ( IBVM ) SPECT Imaging Healthy Subjects Patients With Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 25 patient mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) 25 patient Parkinson 's disease 20 healthy control recruit participate study . AD patient eligible participate diagnosis AD base NINCDS-ADRDA criterion . PD patient eligible participate clinical diagnosis Parkinson 's disease . Healthy control evaluated ensure evidence neurodegenerative change include cognitive decline . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , physical neurological evaluation cognitive assessment . Subjects ask undergo injection 123-I IBVM follow three approximately thirty minute SPECT scan next 24 hour . Subjects may ask undergo second image visit two-weeks six month follow initial image visit ass reproducibility image outcome and/or progressive change baseline 123-I IBVM binding . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked clinical diagnosis . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express target region cerebellar ratio .</detailed_description>
