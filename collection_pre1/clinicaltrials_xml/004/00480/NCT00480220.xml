	<detailed_description>It estimate present time 50 % dependence elderly relate dementia . Alzheimer 's disease common , 100 000 new case France every year ( Girard Report ) . Very often , diagnosis establish person receive regular , codified follow-up , whereas Alzheimer 's disease chronic disease progress several year lead variety complication must identify manage . The main objective work ass feasibility efficacy specific Care Assistance Plan Alzheimer 's disease ( PLASA ) . The main outcome measure select incapacity carry basic activity daily live , evaluate ADCS-ADL scale . The PLASA develop work group appoint Direction Générale de la Santé part government programme action Alzheimer 's disease ( October 2001 , Ministère de l'Emploi et de la Solidarité ) . Methods The multicentre prospective study randomise within centre . Study population : 1200 patient recruit 20 French university hospital 40 general hospital . Inclusion criterion : Patients present mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease diagnose NINCDS-ADRDA criterion ( MMSE 12 26 ) , live home identify principal caregiver . Randomisation patient follow-up : After randomisation within centre ( specialise department university general hospital ) , half patient manage accord PLASA ( group A ) . The patient receive usual management centre ( group B ) . The PLASA include detailed evaluation patient 's cognitive non-cognitive function , regular standardise follow-up , management complication set assistance support service accord common guideline . As part PLASA , patient systematically see consultation every six month . Data collection : In group A , data collect six-monthly consultation duration study ( T0 , T6 , T12 , T18 , T24 ) . In group B , data collect consultation T0 , T12 T24 . The coordinating centre ( Toulouse ) contact every 6 month ( T6 , T12 , T18 , T24 ) , post telephone , principal caregiver collection intermediate data group . These data include evaluation activity daily live ( ADCS-ADL ) , utilization support care service ( RUD ) , well subjective assessment disease severity ( ADCS-CGIC ) . The patient 's quality life also evaluate group T0 , T12 T24 . Statistical analysis : 1200 subject need reveal 30 % decrease incapacities activity daily live group patient follow accord PLASA . Bivariate analysis carry use standard test type study ( chi-squared test Student 's test ) . The efficacy PLASA assess multivariate analysis , take potential confounders account . Expected result : This project contribute good long-term management patient Alzheimer 's disease reduce burden family .</detailed_description>
