	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Satraplatin Plus Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer Patients With Biochemical Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>****Please Note : Dr.Howard Sandler 's site open accrual shortly , Dr. Sarantopoulos 's site San Antonio open recruiting patient . **** There approximately 232,000 case prostate cancer diagnose US 2005 . Most patient present localized disease undergo curative therapy , either radical prostatectomy ( RP ) radiation therapy ( RT ) . Although men cure therapy , approximately 30,000-50,000 annually US develop recurrence RP . For patient , recurrence define biochemical recurrence ( BCR ) , rise PSA document evidence recurrence . Patients BCR typically receive radiation therapy prostate bed . However , 50 % patient develop distant recurrence outside pelvis require systemic therapy . Satraplatin third generation orally administer platinum compound . Early clinical study demonstrate activity tumor ovary lung addition prostate cancer . Satraplatin show activity prostate cancer Phase II study evaluate pivotal Phase III study ( The SPARC trial ) single agent second line therapy .</detailed_description>
