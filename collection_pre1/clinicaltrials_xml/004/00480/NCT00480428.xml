	<brief_summary>Residents certain village Kazakhstan expose childhood radioactive fallout nuclear test conduct Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site ( SNTS ) 1949 1962 . Radiation dose thyroid external internal ( i.e. , ingest ) radiation source deposit fallout interest may jointly differentially associate increase risk thyroid disease population . Objectives : To collect information factor influence radiation dose thyroid gland child two ethnic group expose radioactive fallout nuclear test SNTS 1949 1962 . The two group Kazakhs ( historically nomadic herder ) Europeans ( typically descendants Russian German farmer ) . Eligibility : Women 70 year age old child provide care child 1950s . Men age 70 old engage farm care dairy animal time nuclear test . Design : In focus group format , participant interview collect information follow time nuclear test : - Dairy consumption ; - Source , storage availability milk milk product ; - Time child different age ethnic group spend indoors ; - Building material house school ; - Herding , graze supplemental feed dairy animal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose work improve understanding historical , fallout-related radiation dos receive resident village Kazakhstan immediately downwind Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site ( SNTS ) , multiple nuclear test explosion carry 1949 1962 . In collaboration scientist Institute Biophysics Moscow , NCI develop combined bi-national dose reconstruction methodology base lesson learn study radioactive fallout test SNTS Kazakhstan , Nevada Test Site United States , test site . Gamma ray radionuclides cesium 137 fallout highly penetrate affect organ even radioactive source outside body , whereas less-penetrating beta particle iodine 131 , also plentiful fallout , mainly affect thyroid gland ingest milk dairy animal graze contaminated pasture . We particularly interested kind radiation dose child , thyroid gland small active , tend concentrate ingest iodine , highly sensitive radiation carcinogenesis . The condition fallout exposure Kazakhstan directly relevant follow hypothetical nuclear accident radiation terrorism incident involve high level local fallout . We propose field study Kazakhstan investigate aspect typical daily village life area affect fallout might influence individual radiation dos thyroid gland . Using focus group interview , collect retrospective information factor influence radiation dose thyroid gland child two distinct ethnic group ( Kazakh European ) . These factor include milk milk product consumption , dependence different specie dairy animal know differ respect concentration iodine milk , seasonal practice pasture supplemental feeding dairy animal time nuclear test , time child typically spent outdoors , radiation shield provide dwelling building . We also ask protective measure take time , detail temporary evacuation village predict fallout path particular test . These data fill key gap current dose-reconstruction methodology result improve dose estimate , well basis evaluate quantify dosimetric uncertainty relate bias risk estimate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible , individual must speak Russian Kazakh , able participate twohour focus group session , verify history reside village 1950s . Verification residence history base regional record . 1 . Women : In village , recruit 24 woman . We select woman age 70 year old child provide care child ( i.e. , young sibling , niece nephews ) 1950s . Our first priority recruit woman whose child le 21 year 1950s . If necessary , also recruit woman provide care child ( e.g. , young sibling , niece nephew ) period . We recruit member 1998 cohort member woman community meet eligibility criterion . Subjects chosen represent experience care child different age time nuclear test . In order recruit woman child different age ( less 21 year ) 1950s , screen potential participant child year birth attempt enroll woman whose child represent range age 1950 s. 2 . Men : In village , recruit eight men ( Russian Kazakh ) age 70 old engage farm care dairy animal time nuclear test .</criteria>
