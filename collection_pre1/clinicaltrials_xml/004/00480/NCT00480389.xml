	<detailed_description>This single centre , non-randomized , open label one arm pilot study Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily give 12 week preoperatively patient advance metastatic kidney cancer schedule cytoreductive surgery . Patients fully stag disease progression Brain MRI , CT , whole body Bone Scans , Kidney ultrasound biopsy . Additionally , patient ' cardiac status evaluate pre-enrolment ECG MUGA Scan . Once enrolled study , patient clinic visit week 2 , 8 12 monitoring visit vital sign adverse event record plus blood evaluation hematology chemistry . Patients call week 3,5,6,7,9,10 11 determine change health status . Surgery occur week 13 , one week washout study drug .
