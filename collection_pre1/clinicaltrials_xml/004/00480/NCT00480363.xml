	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate Revlimid Dexamethasone treatment extend time progression symptomatic MM patient smolder MM . The second one evaluate efficacy treatment response rate term . Otherwise study want evaluate safety tolerability treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUIREDEX : Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) Dexamethasone ( ReDex ) Treatment Versus Observation Patients With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma With High Risk Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 120 patient diagnose smolder Multiple Myeloma high risk progression symptomatic MM include . Patients stratify accord diagnosis date randomize 1 1 receive Revlimid Dexamethasone ( Group A ) 9 treatment cycle maintenance low dos progression No treatment observation progression ( Group B ) . The patient evaluate scheduled visit three study period : Pre-treatment , Treatment Follow . The Pre-treatment include Screening baseline visit . After provide informed consent , patient evaluate study eligibility Patients stratify randomize ( 1:1 ) Group A Group B . During Treatment Period patient evaluate month . Once treatment period finish maintenance treatment low dos Revlimid Dexamethasone carry Group A . During period evaluate response , progression-free survival global survival every two month .</detailed_description>
