	<brief_summary>We hypothesize specifically select probiotic alleviate symptom allergy lactose tolerant individual . Two strain probiotic , Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 , Bifidobacterium adolescentis 7007-05 used create yogurt product . Additionally non-probiotic yogurt product also make placebo . Allergy sufferer ask consume one two type yogurt ( blind ) two month . During two month 3 sample day , blood sample nasal lavage sample . Additionally Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality Life Questionnaires fill weekly two month . After two month perceive response well sample analysis well idea specific probiotic effect immune system allergy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Anti-allergic Effects Specific Probiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probiotics `` live microorganism administer adequate amount confer health benefit host '' . Many study perform indicate probiotic temporarily modify composition gut microbiota , potentially reduce susceptibility allergy ( Noverr &amp; Huffnagle , 2005 ) ( Tannock et al . 2000 ) , lead health benefit host . Numerous study show benefit include one prim immune response host . Animals maintain free microorganism drastic abnormality immune response . These germ-free animal alter Peyer 's Patches , reduce level IgA associate increase risk gastrointestinal infection , unable develop oral tolerance ingest antigen ( Moreau et al . 1988 ) . When animal later colonize normal intestinal bacteria , overcome past deficiency , restore ability oral tolerance . This allow blockade IgE production key factor allergic disease ( Moreau et . al 1988 ) . Studies inflammatory bowel disease patient show certain probiotic actually reduce inflammation diminish disease ( Bruzzese et al . 2004 ) ( Baroja et al . submit ) . The former study investigate 75 child , study ( Baroja ) show regulation inflammation 8/20 inflammatory bowel diseased patient . Allergic disease almost non-existent underdeveloped country , interestingly , ferment food consume regularly . This differ considerably numerous allergy lack ferment food intake Western World . Investigators hypothesize human gut ecosystem evolve require daily intake lactic acid bacteria ( Molin 2001 ) , bacteria maintain immunological regulation protect allergic sensitization development allergic disease . Recent study show probiotic significant influence allergic reaction . The consumption Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG pregnant woman lower occurrence baby bear atopic dermatitis compare birth woman consume probiotic ( Kalliomaki et al . 2001 ) . Another study 27 infant suffer atopic eczema , show probiotic-supplemented formula decrease severity condition ( Isolauri et al 2000 ) . The efficacy probiotic treat allergy show Bifidobacterium longum BB536 relieve Japanese cedar tree pollinosis , probably modulation Th2-skewed immune response ( Xiao et al . 2006 ) . Another Japanese study show synbiotic L. casei subsp . casei dextran effective supplement prevention treatment allergic reaction cedar pollen ( Ogawa et al . 2006 ) . Not study show benefit , one perform teenager young adult allergic birch pollen apple food , show effect intermittent symptom atopic allergy and/or mild asthma . We isolate strain bifidobacteria stool subject history allergy , along two lactobacilli probiotic show strong anti-allergy potential vitro . In short , evidence indicate study worthwhile use food base probiotic , completely prevent allergy , contribute towards alleviation . Objective 1 . We examine cell type nasal cavity expectation shift probiotic consume , decrease number eosinophil , characteristic late-phase allergic inflammatory symptom , study progress , correspond decrease neutrophil . Objective 2 . We characterize subject 's sensitivity inhalant seasonal potentially year-round allergen . Routine RAST test perform begin study test sensitivity towards mixed grass , mixed tree , mixed weed , mixed mold , ragweed , house dust , cat dander dog dander . From able differentiate subject highly susceptible allergy moderately susceptible . At end trial perform RAST test use ragweed mixed grass allergen , anticipation probiotic treatment anti-allergic strain decrease subject 's sensitivity particular allergen , receive regular yogurt effect . Objective 3 . We identify change serum cytokine level would indicate shift inflammatory state one reduce inflammation . We anticipate presence inflammatory cytokine , IL-5 , IL-4 IL-13 decrease subject 's intestinal flora boost anti-allergic probiotic ; likewise , presence anti-inflammatory cytokine , IL-10 , TGFβ2 , IFN-γ increase treatment . This shift cytokine production reflect reduced allergic symptom . In addition , Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays perform select blood sample characterize immunological signal transduction pathway activate probiotic bacteria . Objective 4 . We characterize perceived effect anti-allergic strain probiotic use questionnaire . Subjects self-administer validated Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality Life Questionnaire ( MiniRQLQ ) © ( Juniper et al. , 2000 ) day 0 weekly study period . The questionnaire include 14 question five domain : activity limitation , practical problem nose symptom , eye symptom symptom . The question answer scale 0-6 ( troubled extremely troubled ) depend troubled subject due nose/eye symptom past week . Possible lung symptom ( cough , dyspnoea wheeze ) record separately use scale . This perceived effect may actually single important outcome study . If sample actually show decrease inflammatory cytokine etc . subject perceive change allergy symptom , probiotic state affected allergic response . We hope shift cytokine cellular level towards anti-inflammatory state reflect subject 's awareness decrease allergy symptom . At end study hope know whether regular probiotic yogurt potential alleviate symptom allergic rhinitis , well regulate inflammatory process human . It anticipate least one yogurts show promise regard . However , even negative result would informative , experiment show u consumer respond physiologically different ferment food .</detailed_description>
