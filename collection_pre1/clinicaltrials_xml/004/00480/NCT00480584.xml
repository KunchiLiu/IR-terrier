	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Capecitabine Combination With Gemcitabine Erlotinib Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I clinical trial examine safety , feasibility , toxicity gemcitabine erlotinib give combination capecitabine adult patient locally advance unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . This combination drug never use . Screening test consist demographic , medical history , physical exam , vital sign , height , weight , performance status , blood count , chemistry , clot . There also electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , tumor measurement ( compute tomography [ CT Scan ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] positron emission tomography CT [ PET-CT ] ) , cancer antigen ( CA 19-9 ) , serum pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . Tumor measurement also perform cycle 2 , 4 , 6 ( study end ) . Treatment administer outpatient basis consist intravenous ( IV ) medication tablet take mouth . The gemcitabine administer Moffitt per week 3 week , follow week treatment . One tablet erlotinib take mouth continuously start day one cycle 1 capecitabine take twice per day day 1-14 cycle follow 2 week treatment rest period . This set treatment call cycle . One full cycle treatment last 28 day total 6 cycle treatment plan . Before cycle repeat blood count brief physical exam ( vital sign ) record weekly first 3 week 28 day cycle treatment ( receive Gemcitabine ) . An accelerated dose-escalation scheme employ 4 plan dose level . Patients enrol low dosage level , patient unacceptable toxicity , dose escalate additional patient enrol . If one patient give dose level experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , patient treat dose level . When 2 patient DLTs dose , dose deescalated previous dose additional patient enrol . After de-escalation begin , whenever patient enrol give dose 1 DLT , protocol stop dose call maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Patients treat recommended phase II dose ( RPTD ) confirm tolerability dose . In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue 6 cycle disease progression . Patients may continue study regimen unless experience adverse event meet criteria dose limit toxicity .</detailed_description>

Prior 5fluorouracil ( 5FU ) capecitabine treatment allow : 1 ) give part combine modality chemoradiation regimen 2 ) great 30 % bone marrow include field 3 ) treatment free interval &gt; 6 week Must measurable disease , define least one lesion measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Age great equal 18 year Because dose adverse event data currently available use capecitabine combination gemcitabine erlotinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Pancreatic adenocarcinoma primarily disease elderly . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Life expectancy &gt; 8 week Must normal organ marrow function define : 1. leukocyte , great equal 3,000/μl 2. absolute neutrophil count , great equal 1,500/μl 3. platelet , great equal to100,000/μl 4. total bilirubin , less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal 5 .

Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Patients agree continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior chemotherapy pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic setting eligible . Chemoradiation within last 6 week prior registration eligible Known allergy severe reaction gemcitabine , capecitabine , tyrosine kinase inhibitor eligible May receive investigational agent receive investigational agent within 28 day prior registration . Known brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse event . Prior malignancy last 3 year , except basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell , insitu cervical cancer ECOG PS 34 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study gemcitabine capecitabine Class D agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib agent administer study . Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ( CockcroftGault method ) Patients require ongoing ( chronic ) treatment medication metabolize CYP3A4 ( saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , indinavir , ketoconazole , itraconazole , nefazodone , clarithromycin , atazanavir , rifampicin , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , St. John 's Wort ) switch alternate medication metabolize CYP3A4 exclude .</criteria>
