	<brief_summary>This treatment study target specifically want stop use marijuana . We want find patient dependent marijuana want stop use help combination drug dronabinol six session individual therapy ( BRENDA ) . Dronabinol pill form active ingredient marijuana ( THC ) . Currently , dronabinol approve treatment nausea people receive cancer chemotherapy appetite stimulant people AIDS . In study , dronabinol reduced amount psychological physical discomfort experience people stop use marijuana . One purpose study see people dronabinol few problem psychological physical discomfort placebo . In addition treatment , research trial also measure reaction subject drug-related cue , also computer-presented task unrelated drug use . We may examine whether response cues/tasks either predicts treatment outcome , affect treatment . This information may also help u understand way chronic drug use cause change subject ' mental functioning change respond treatment . In addition participation treatment research trial , subject may ask undergo brain scan MRI . The purpose brain scan research project measure brain reaction non-invasive , non-radioactive imaging technique know fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) marijuana subject treatment medication dronabinol inactive substance ( placebo ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study Dronabinol BRENDA Treatment Cannabis Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Cannabis widely use illicit drug U.S . According 2004 U.S . The 2004 NSDUH estimate 3.2 million daily almost daily marijuana smoker United States . Recent report estimate 1.5 % US population meet DSM-IV diagnostic criterion cannabis abuse dependence , sharp increase among young black men woman young Hispanic men ( 2 ) . Cannabis user commonly endorse adverse psychosocial medical effect cannabis use , include dysphoria , loss control use , cognitive impairment , strain social relationship . In human , cannabis withdrawal syndrome constellation affective behavioral symptom occur within 24 48 hour abrupt cessation marijuana use gradual return baseline 1-2 week . A recent review literature cannabis withdrawal identify consistent report anxiety , irritability , physical discomfort , insomnia , appetite suppression associate abrupt cessation cannabis use heavy user across controlled inpatient outpatient trial . The agonist dronabinol ( Marinol ) show promise prevention cannabis withdrawal human lab study report amelioration anxiety , misery , insomnia , drug crave appetite suppression abrupt cannabis cessation provide rationale use agent prevent cannabis withdrawal outpatient , treatment seek population ( 9 ) . Dronabinol also use brief `` maintenance '' treatment cannabis self-administration study human . Currently , dronabinol indicated treatment AIDS-related anorexia nausea associate cancer chemotherapy . Two principle aim proposal therefore gain familiarity cannabis withdrawal naturalistic outpatient treatment set compare agonist therapy placebo attenuate cannabis withdrawal enhance treatment outcome . The general pattern low rate total abstinence lack significant difference high intensity psychotherapy treatment vs. low intensity voucher-based treatment hold across psychosocial treatment study . In keep prior evidence support relative efficacy brief intervention cannabis dependence , current proposal apply well-established brief medicalized psychotherapy know B.R.E.N.D.A . treatment cannabis dependence . To date , study evaluate cannabis patient primarily focus identify neurotoxic drug effect impair learning , memory , attention executive function . We propose fully examine behavior relevance addiction vulnerability relapse . Such behavior include limited poor inhibition , high risk-taking , positive affective bias toward drug stimulus , poor affect regulation , poor decision-making . We plan utilize standardized task questionnaire objectively characterize dimension addiction relevant behavior cannabis patient examine effect cannabis withdrawal dronabinol treatment behavioral measure . We also correlate brain difference ( structural functional ) behavioral measure cannabis dependent patient treatment dronabinol compare placebo . The search effective treatment addictive disorder limit incomplete knowledge brain substrates critical addiction addiction recovery . The recent use PET fMRI allow researcher examine connection brain activity vulnerability addiction relapse . In marijuana user , PET fMRI technique use study regional brain volume , blood flow , metabolism . However , understand cue induce crave immediately relevant treatment relapse prevention cannabis addiction since cannabis user high rate relapse compare find drug abuse . In addiction , cue consistently associate drug reward trigger crave drug . Clinically , crave drug sufficiently compel many case precipitate relapse despite significant effort patient 's part maintain abstinence despite significant negative consequence . Although PET fMRI technique successfully use study cue induce crave drug abuse ( e.g . cocaine ) lead great understand mechanism relapse ( limbic activation response drug cue ) , technique utilized cannabis patient . Several preliminary study use patient self-report demonstrate cue induce crave cannabis patient . We propose utilize physiological measure functional neuroimaging objectively demonstrate cue-induced craving cannabis dependent subject identify brain substrate mediate crave . Similarly , dronabinol reduce self-reported drug crave one recent human laboratory study . We propose examine whether dronabinol change physiological measure brain activation response drug cue . 2 . Study objectives : 1 . To evaluate cannabis withdrawal syndrome naturalistic outpatient set one possible cause low rate total abstinence see trial clinical trial adult cannabis dependence . 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Subjective rating cannabis withdrawal assess reliably outpatient treatment set . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Subjects high subjective rating cannabis withdrawal low rate abstinence regardless treatment group ( dronabinol vs. placebo ) . 2 . To determine feasibility efficacy three-week trial cannabinoid agonist medication double blind placebo control condition treat cannabis withdrawal . 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Dronabinol use safely dosage 10mg qid ( four time per day ) outpatient treatment cannabis withdrawal 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Dronabinol perform good placebo attenuate symptom cannabis withdrawal . 3 . To determine feasibility efficacy provide brief psychotherapy ( BRENDA ) patient seek treatment cannabis dependence . 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Six session BRENDA therapy apply treatment cannabis dependence . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Six-sessions BRENDA therapy cannabis dependence adequate `` dose '' individual therapy subject motivate stop smoking marijuana . 4 . To characterize neurocognitive aspect ( e.g . attention , work memory , impulsivity , decision making , risk-taking , affective bias/drug preference , reward punishment sensitivity , affect regulation ) cannabis dependence , cannabis withdrawal dronabinol effect utilizing battery task , questionnaire interview . 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Poor performance neurocognitive task questionnaire correlate duration amount cannabis use . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Cannabis withdrawal correlate impaired performance neurocognitive task questionnaire . Dronabinol treatment reduce impairment task affect regulation affective bias/drug preference compare placebo . 5 . To objectively demonstrate cue-induced crave cannabis dependent patient determine whether baseline measure cannabis patient ' brain vulnerability ( structure , function ; e.g. , rest perfusion ) predict brain behavioral outcome . 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Cue-induced crave positively correlate change physiological measure increase amygdalar activation negatively correlate prefrontal activation cannabis dependent patient cannabis discontinuation , dronabinol treatment reduce intensity cue- induce physiological change brain activation compare placebo . 2 . Secondary Hypotheses : Measures prefrontal cortex gray matter rest perfusion prefrontal cortex , cingulate cortex amygdala positively correlate performance neurocognitive task questionnaires well treatment outcome . 3 . Location : This single site study . All patient recruitment data collection occur Treatment Research Center University Pennsylvania , 3900 Chestnut Street , Philadelphia , PA 19104 , except Neuroimaging take place HUP6 fMRI basement Hospital University Pennsylvania , 34th Spruce Streets , Philadelphia , PA 19104 . STUDY DESIGN 4 . Research design &amp; methodology : This Phase 2 double blind placebo control trial . We recruit 60 cannabis dependent subject treat combination dronabinol 10mg QID ( four time per day ) BRENDA placebo qid ( four time per day ) BRENDA reduce consumption cannabis . Subjects 60 men woman current DSM-IV diagnosis cannabis dependence . All patient receive six session BRENDA visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 . The study length patient one week screen baseline self-report neurocognitive battery measure . Patients qualify offer opportunity participate fMRI portion study baseline fMRI obtain first week prior start medication second fMRI obtain week two medication . This follow 3 week medication , complete medication , three additional weekly visit ( two BRENDA one final assessment ) . 5 . Duration : Each subject participate 7 week treatment trial follow schedule visit : STUDY VISITS Week 1 ( Baseline Measures ) : Week 2 - 4 ( Medication Treatment ) : Weeks 5-6 ( Medication Washout ) Week 7 ( Final Visit ) : We anticipate require two year complete data collection 60 subject require one year data analysis . Thus , propose study complete approximately three year . SUBJECT SELECTION &amp; WITHDRAWAL</detailed_description>
