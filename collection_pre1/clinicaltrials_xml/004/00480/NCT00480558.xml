	<detailed_description>Prime-boost immunization strategy Heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy involve give two different vaccine , encode antigen , several week apart . Using DNA prime-recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) boost induces high level antigen specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell use homologous boost vector number different disease model ( Schneider , 1998 ; McShane , 2001 ) . Given protective efficacy BCG childhood , ideally BCG would prim immunization prime-boost strategy . In order , focus antigen 85A candidate antigen . Antigen 85A highly conserve amongst mycobacterial specie present strain BCG . Antigen 85A major secrete antigen M. tuberculosis form part antigen 85 complex ( A , B C ) . This complex constitute major portion secrete protein M.tb BCG . It involve fibronectin binding within cell wall mycolyltransferase activity . Antigen 85A immunodominant murine human study protective small animal ( Huygen , 1996 ) . Recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( rMVA ) . Many virus investigate potential recombinant vaccine . The successful worldwide eradication smallpox via vaccination live vaccinia virus highlight vaccinia candidate recombinant use . The recognition recent year non- replicate strain poxvirus MVA avipox vector immunogenic traditional replicating vaccinia strain enhance attractiveness approach . MVA ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara ) strain vaccinia virus passaged 570 time though avian cell , replication incompetent human cell line good safety record . It administer 120,000 vaccinee part smallpox eradication programme , adverse effect , despite deliberate vaccination high risk group ( Stickl , 1974 ; Mahnel , 1994 ) . This safety man consistent avirulence MVA animal model . MVA six major genomic deletion compare parental genome severely compromise ability replicate mammalian cell ( Meher , 1991 ) . No replication document non- transformed mammalian cell . Viral replication block late infection cell importantly viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired even abortive infection . The viral genome proven stable large series passage chicken embryo fibroblast . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA see exceptionally safe viral vector . When test animal model study recombinant MVA 's show avirulent , yet protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . Recent study severely immunosuppressed macaque support view MVA safe immunocompromised human ( Akira , 2001 ; Stittelaar , 2001 ) . Safety rMVAs immunosuppression . There considerable preclinical clinical data demonstrate safety immunogenicity MVA viral vector immunosuppression HIV infection . Recombinant MVAs express HIV antigen administer immunosuppressed macaque serious adverse event ( Stittelaar et al , 2001 ) . In addition , safety recombinant MVAs express HIV antigens epitope evaluate several Phase I clinical trial HIV-infected subject , antiretroviral therapy , serious adverse event ( Cosma et al , 2003 ; Harrer et al 2005 ) . Preclinical data support BCG prime-MVA85A boost strategy In BALB/c mouse , use BCG prim immunization boost MVA85A induces high level antigen specific IFN-γ secreting CD4+ CD8+ T cell significantly great level protection aerosol challenge BCG alone ( Goonetilleke et al , 2003 ) . This regime evaluate sensitive guinea pig aerosol challenge model encouraging result . Guinea pig vaccinate BCG boost MVA85A , boost second recombinant viral vector express antigen 85A , fowlpox-85A ( FP85A ) show significantly great protection challenge guinea pig vaccinate BCG alone ( Williams et al , 2005 ) . This regime also immunogenic rhesus macaque , protective ( Verrek , personal communication ) . Clinical data date MVA85A UK study Over last 3 year HM establish clinical trial programme evaluate safety immunogenicity BCG prime-MVA85A boost vaccination strategy series Phase I study . MVA85A first candidate TB vaccine enter clinical trial anywhere world September 2002 , currently one clinical trial Africa . The design Phase I study MVA85A allow sequential vaccination volunteer group step-wise increase mycobacterial exposure , minimize possibility Koch reaction . Trials also conduct sequentially UK The Gambia , great degree exposure environmental mycobacteria M.tb The Gambia . A Koch reaction describes development immunopathology person animal tuberculosis , exaggerate immune response M.tb stimulate . It describe patient TB disease Koch perform original study employ mycobacteria type therapeutic vaccination . It demonstrate mouse model therapeutic vaccination27 . Available animal data suggest reaction occur mice latently infect M.tb , suggest reaction may correlate high bacterial load Koch phenomenon may pose problem vaccination asymptomatic albeit latently infect humans25 . In UK , 14 mycobacterially BCG naïve , asymptomatic volunteer recruit . vaccinate twice 5 x 107pfu MVA85A , administer intradermally 3 week interval . In study , MVA85A find safe well tolerate . All subject experience local side-effects ( redness , itch etc ) last 3-7 day vaccination . Approximately one third subject experience transient systemic symptom ( myalgia , headache ) first 12-24 hour vaccination . All local systemic side-effects spontaneously resolve . There serious severe adverse event study . The main immunological outcome use ongoing clinical trial ex-vivo interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) Elispot assay , use ass specific T cell response tuberculin PPD , purify antigen 85 complex pool overlap 15mer peptide span length antigen 85A . A single vaccination MVA85A induce remarkably high level specific effector T cell response 1 week vaccination ( mean IFN-γ Elispot response PPD 460 spot per million PBMC ) . Next , safety MVA85A volunteer previously vaccinate BCG demonstrate 17 volunteer . The safety profile MVA85A 17 volunteer BCG naïve group . These 17 volunteer show even high peak level antigen specific T cell ( mean response PPD 917 spot per million PBMC ) 1 week post-vaccination immunized MVA85A alone . Perhaps importantly induction T cell memory , volunteer previously BCG vaccinate maintain significantly high level antigen specific T cell MVA85A 24 week vaccination , compare volunteer vaccinate either BCG MVA85A alone ( McShane et al , 2004 ) . The next trial conduct UK look boost efficacy MVA85A administer one month BCG vaccination . 10 healthy , BCG naïve volunteer vaccinate BCG one month later boost MVA85A . Comparable safety boost efficacy see previous trial interval BCG MVA85A 0.5-37 year . The current ongoing study UK design assess safety immunogenicity MVA85A asymptomatic volunteer latently infect M.tb . Latent infection M.tb describe state individual presume low level persistent bacterial infection clinical radiological evidence disease , yet detectable immune response M.tb . Latent infection study define use specific diagnostic test base antigen absent BCG environmental mycobacteria ESAT 6 CFP 10 , allow accurate diagnosis latent M.tb infection make . Subjects study recruit TB contact clinic vaccinate single dose MVA85A . Follow-up involve detailed radiological clinical assessment safety vaccine group . To date , 11 subject vaccinate MVA85A study safety immunogenicity profile MVA85A identical see previous study . Importantly clinical , radiological immunological evidence Koch reaction . The Elispot responses PPD , ESAT 6 , CFP10 , antigen 85A mycobacterial antigen monitor 12 month follow vaccination . Gambian study Following success trial MVA85A UK , collaboration MRC unit The Gambia initiate . MVA85A first evaluate Phase I clinical trial BCG naïve subject ( n = 11 ) subsequently BCG prim subject ( n=10 ) . In study safety immunogenicity profile comparable see UK study . In UK The Gambian study , MVA85A induce 5-10 fold high immune response recombinant MVA clinical trial . The likely explanation volunteer weak pre-existing anti-mycobacterial immunity induce exposure environmental mycobacteria , boost vaccination MVA85A . When MVA85A administer BCG naïve subject Gambia , magnitude kinetics response resemble BCG prim group UK , find likely represent great degree environmental prim tropical climate . South African study A Phase II study safety immunogenicity MVA85A healthy , M.tb uninfected HIV uninfected adult Cape Town commence August 2005 . The study MVA85A site begin adult , safety requirement despite fact already safety immunogenicity data adult UK Gambian study . The population South Africa different UK Gambian population term host genetics mycobacterial exposure . There considerably M.tb exposure South Africa Gambia exposure environmental mycobacterial believe low South Africa Gambia . The BCG literature demonstrate wide variation efficacy across geographical area important confirm finding adult Cape Town proceed study adolescent . We aim vaccinate 24 adult total . These study commence August 2005 , date , 14 volunteer vaccinate . Encouragingly , safety immunogenicity result far comparable previous study UK Gambia .</detailed_description>
