	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : Patients local renal cell carcinoma treat neoadjuvantly Sutent may show radiologic response study drug ( Sutent ) . The study look neoadjuvant ( pre-surgery ) administration Sutent patient localize kidney cancer . The purpose research also evaluate safety effectiveness Sutent patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Neoadjuvant Sutent Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sutent give 50 mg daily 4 consecutive week follow 1 week rest period . The dosage may change cycle due possible drug toxicity . The nephrectomy take place follow one-week washout period . After surgery , patient follow-up visit 6 week 3 month . Patients follow 3 year completion assess late toxicity , time progression progression-free survival .</detailed_description>
