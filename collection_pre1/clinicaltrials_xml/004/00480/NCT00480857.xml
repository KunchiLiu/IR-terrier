	<brief_summary>The main purpose study try find whether add chemotherapy standard treatment stage prostate cancer effective standard treatment . The kind treatment physician would consider standard stage prostate cancer radiation therapy alone , possibly combination hormonal therapy . In study , patient receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . It hop chemotherapy find provide additional benefit , chemotherapy significant side effect . The use chemotherapy experimental prostate cancer ; need test determine beneficial find side effect two different treatment . This study determine effect , good and/or bad , add chemotherapy radiation therapy `` salvage '' treatment recurrent prostate cancer surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salvage Radiation Therapy Taxotere PSA Failure After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There treatment proven effective clinically localized prostate cancer radical prostatectomy . Nonetheless , approximately 30,000 men annually U.S. develop recurrence prostate cancer prostatectomy . Radiation therapy commonly utilized attempted salvage treatment patient develop rise PSA ( Prostate Specific Antigen ) prostatectomy evidence metastatic disease . This study design determine whether concurrent chemotherapy , weekly docetaxel , daily radiation therapy result improved disease control survival rate obtain radiotherapy alone treatment men biochemical recurrence radical prostatectomy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 Performance Status : Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80 % ( Performance status attempt quantify cancer patient ' general wellbeing activity daily life . The Karnofsky score run 100 0 , 100 `` perfect '' health 0 death . ) Has undergone prostatectomy histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate least 6 week prior registration . ( If prostatectomy complete outside facility , University Michigan pathology review must take place confirm adenocarcinoma . ) Has biochemical evidence failure determine least two PSA measurement prostatectomy . This must demonstrate increase least 0.1 ng/mL two consecutive measurement , obtain prostatectomy . The recent measurement ( within 28 day registration ) must 0.3 ng/mL great . Has undergone pelvic CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan radionuclide bone scan within 90 day prior registration show evidence regional distant nodal bone metastasis . Patients pelvic abdominal lymph node equivocal questionable image eligible node &lt; 1.5 cm long axis . Equivocal bone scan finding allow plain film show conclusive evidence metastasis . Hematologic Criteria : CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) /differential obtain within 28 day prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb = 8.0 g/dl acceptable ) . Hepatic Criteria within 28 day prior registration : Total bilirubin &lt; 1 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ALT ( Alanine Transaminase ) , AST ( Aspartate Aminotransferase ) , alkaline phosphatase must within eligible range stipulate protocol table Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN Both radiation oncology medical oncology consultation prior registration . Pharmacologic androgen ablation prostate cancer allow give prior prostatectomy . Patient must sign study specific informed consent prior study entry . Peripheral neuropathy : must ≤ grade 1 Patients must willing consent use effective contraception treatment least 3 month thereafter . Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Evidence M1 metastatic disease Pathologically positive lymph node node &gt; 1.5 cm image Prior pelvic radiotherapy would result overlap radiation therapy field systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 5 year ( example , carcinoma situ oral cavity bladder permissible ) Severe , active comorbidity , define follow , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within 6 month prior registration . Transmural myocardial infarction within 6 month prior registration Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive .</criteria>
