	<brief_summary>This study preliminary proving vaccine could protect tuberculosis human . Although proven data show infant benefit directly participation study protect TB , MVA85A protection mouse , guinea pig monkey tuberculosis encouraging . It hop information gain study contribute development safe effective TB vaccine HIV negative positive individual . Participants study benefit information general health status , rigorous follow visit could enhance early detection management medical condition might arise course study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over last 3 year Phase I study MVA85A allow sequential vaccination volunteer group step-wise increase mycobacterial exposure , minimize possibility Koch reaction . Trials also conduct sequentially UK The Gambia , great degree exposure environmental mycobacteria M.tb The Gambia . A Koch reaction describes development immunopathology person animal tuberculosis , exaggerate immune response M.tb stimulate . It demonstrate mouse model therapeutic vaccination ( Taylor et al , 2003 ) . Available animal data suggest reaction occur mice latently infect M.tb , suggest reaction may correlate high bacterial load Koch phenomenon may pose problem vaccination healthy albeit latently infect human ( Taylor et al , 2003 ) . In UK , 14 mycobacterially BCG naïve , healthy volunteer vaccinate twice 5 x 107pfu MVA85A , administer intradermally 3 week interval . MVA85A find safe well tolerate . A single vaccination MVA85A induce remarkably high level specific effector T cell response 1 week vaccination ( mean γ IFN Elispot response PPD 460 spot per million PBMC ) . MVA85A also safe 17 volunteer vaccinate BCG previous 0.5-37 year . The safety profile MVA85A 17 volunteer BCG naïve group . Interestingly , 17 volunteer show even high peak level antigen specific T cell ( mean response PPD 917 spot per million PBMC ) 1 week post-vaccination immunized MVA85A alone . Perhaps importantly induction T cell memory , volunteer previously BCG vaccinate maintain significantly high level antigen specific T cell MVA85A 24 week vaccination , compare volunteer vaccinate either BCG MVA85A alone ( McShane et al , 2004 ) . The next trial UK look boost efficacy MVA85A administer one month BCG vaccination . 10 healthy , BCG naïve volunteer vaccinate BCG one month later boost MVA85A . Safety boost efficacy comparable previous trial interval BCG MVA85A 0.5-37 year . 2.3.2 Gambian study Following success trial MVA85A UK , collaboration MRC unit The Gambia initiate . MVA85A first evaluate Phase I clinical trial BCG naïve subject ( n = 11 ) subsequently BCG prim subject ( n=10 ) . In study safety immunogenicity profile comparable see UK study . In UK The Gambian study , MVA85A induce 5-10 fold high immune response recombinant MVA clinical trial . The likely explanation volunteer weak pre-existing anti-mycobacterial immunity induce exposure environmental mycobacteria , boost vaccination MVA85A . When MVA85A administer BCG naïve subject Gambia , magnitude kinetics response resemble BCG prim group UK , find likely represent great degree environmental prim tropical climate . Taken together , 600 people , include HIV positive 250 Gambian adult child , immunise various recombinant MVA investigational vaccine include construct express malaria , HIV , hepatitis B melanoma antigen without significant adverse reaction ( Hill , unpublished data ) . Furthermore , 190 child age 1-5 year vaccinate recombinant MVA express malarial antigen 2006 , vaccine relate SAEs ( Hill , personal communication ) . This safety data allow progression test MVA85A phase II study infant vaccinate BCG , Gambian population may include low number latently M.tb infect HIV positive child . It important test safety , immunogenicity , possible interference ( detrimental , none beneficial ) EPI vaccine MVA85A vaccine group , one potential target population large-scale efficacy study . Also effect simultaneous EPI vaccine administration immunogenicity MVA85A need evaluate .</detailed_description>
