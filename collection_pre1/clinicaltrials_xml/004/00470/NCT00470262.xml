	<brief_summary>The relationship obesity insulin resistance know , however mechanism ( ) associate obesity insulin resistance well understood . Inflammation accumulation fat non fat tissue ( like muscle ) condition find obesity could potential link obesity insulin resistance . This study design test effect two different drug numerous feature obesity insulin resistance subject impair glucose tolerance . Impaired glucose tolerance condition blood sugar high drinking sugary drink contain 75 gram sugar . Impaired glucose tolerant subject insulin resistant risk develop diabetes . The drug use fenofibrate pioglitazone . Fenofibrate use reduce amount fat ( triglyceride ) blood pioglitazone routinely use make body sensitive insulin patient diabetes . The purpose study compare effect either two medication ( pioglitazone fenofibrate ) alone combination fat accumulation body ( muscle ) inflammation . The amount fat accumulation muscle think affect insulin sensitivity . In addition , change level protein produce fat tissue study response two medication study . These protein think involve diabetes insulin resistance . These study design examine fundamental clinical mechanism underlie metabolic syndrome diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects PPAR Ligands Ectopic Fat Accumulation Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The correlation obesity , inflammation ectopic fat accumulation well recognize ; however , mechanism ( ) responsible obesity induce insulin resistance well understood . The investigator focus lipotoxicity inflammation link obesity insulin resistance . The factor lead inflammation ectopic lipid accumulation obesity best intervention reverse pathophysiology clear . In study , investigator examine inflammation adipose tissue muscle lipid mechanism response Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors ( PPAR ) ligands synergistic anti-inflammatory effect adipose tissue activation PPAR decrease muscle lipid oxidation redistribution lipid muscle adipocytes respectively . The combination medication particularly effective reduce inflammation muscle lipid accumulation . In study , IGT subject randomize treatment PPAR ligand ( fenofibrate ) , PPAR ligand ( pioglitazone ) combination 10 week . Baseline study include assessment body composition , insulin sensitivity , muscle fat biopsy . All study repeat treatment fenofibrate , pioglitazone combination . Specific Aims ( SA ) follow : SA 1 . Insulin sensitivity Intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) muscle biopsy specimen measure response different treatment ( PPAR , combination ligand ) . SA 2 . The rate fatty acid oxidation number mitochondrion muscle measure response PPAR ligands . SA 3 . The anti-inflammatory effect PPAR ligands studied measurement number adipose tissue macrophage rate macrophage apoptosis fat biopsy specimen . In addition , plasma level expression proinflammatory protein study response different treatment . SA 4 . The rate SUMOylation PPAR ( novel mechanism regulate anti-inflammatory effect PPAR ligands ) study response PPAR , ligand combination . These study design examine fundamental clinical mechanism underlie metabolic syndrome diabetes . Potential Impact Veterans Health Care : The national obesity/diabetes epidemic magnify VA , cost caring patient enormous . This study provide data mechanism action drug , improve investigator ' understanding drug , impair glucose tolerance , treatment metabolic syndrome . From clinical perspective , study us drug treat patient IGT , rapidly become recognize `` disease '' association coronary artery disease risk factor , high rate progression T2DM . If drug show improve care patient , would eventually cost saving VA , either choose less expensive drug , use drug delay progression disease , improve care patient prevent complication .</detailed_description>
