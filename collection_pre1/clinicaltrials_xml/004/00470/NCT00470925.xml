	<brief_title>Assessment Effect Sertaline Specific Binding 123-I MZINT Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serotonin ( 5-HT ) monoamine neurotransmitter find peripheral central nervous system . It responsible regulate wide variety physiological process high CNS function . 5-HT neuron project diffusely throughout brain , innervate cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , midbrain , brainstem cerebellum , play prominent role regulate physiological behavioral response arousal , thermoregulation , anxiety , affect . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation . healthy subject undergo baseline 123-I MZINT injection SPECT imaging described . At baseline , healthy subject start either treatment ( n=4 ) , one three different dos sertraline ( 25 mg/day n=2 , 50 mg/day n=2 150 mg/day n=2 ) , administer 14 day period . Fourteen day follow image session 1 , subject ( treat sertraline untreated ) undergo second 123-I MZINT SPECT image study . Data baseline follow-up SPECT image compare evaluate effect sertraline regional brain uptake 123-I MZINT . The subject randomize treatment serve control provide preliminary test-retest reproducibility data image outcome measure . The goal proposal evaluate effect sertraline administration specific [ 123-I ] mZINT . In vitro vivo data early human study baboon study strongly support evaluation [ 123I ] mZINT healthy subject .</detailed_description>
