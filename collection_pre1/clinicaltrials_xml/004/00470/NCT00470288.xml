	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare outcomes cesarean section patient undergo bladder flap versus none . Hypotheses : Operative time reduce elimination bladder flap cesarean delivery intra-operative post-operative morbidity significantly different . Patients &gt; = 35 wks gestation undergo cesarean delivery randomize bladder flap vs. none . Primary outcome operative time ( start delivery ) ; secondary outcome include : injury , EBL , intra-operative post-operative complication , pain medication , hospital stay duration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Title A Randomized Controlled Trial Bladder Flap vs. None Cesarean Section 2 . Background ( This section use provide rationale conduct study . Refer existent preliminary study necessary ) The standard care perform cesarean delivery perform bladder flap procedures.1 The creation bladder flap essentially allow surgeon create space uterus bladder he/she well access low portion uterus low transverse incision make . This procedure involve make superficial incision peritoneum , cell line abdominal cavity , move bladder away low portion uterus . A retractor bladder blade insert space hold bladder away uterus ( see Appendix A ) .2 Use bladder flap cesarean delivery date back 1878 pre-antibiotic era,3 theoretically , bladder flap allow good access low portion uterus decrease risk bladder injury infection . However , several recent small study suggest inclusion bladder flap confers advantage may actually contribute great morbidity postoperatively . 4-5 Additionally , incidence bladder injury 0.3 % , injury result formation bladder flap.6 The evidence study limit inclusion modification surgical procedure lack replication result , respectively . Thus insufficient evidence either support reject inclusion bladder flap cesarean delivery ( Evidence grade C ) .7-8 3 . Specific Objectives ( Enumerate objectives nature measure end-points . Justify use surrogate clinical end-points necessary ) 1 . To compare outcomes cesarean section patient undergo bladder flap versus none . 4 . Study design ( Explicate nature study – observational v experimental . Differentiate cohort , case-control , cross-sectional randomized clinical trial . For latter , provide sufficient support justification experimental arm . If placebo-controlled trial , please state whether clinical equipoise exist placebo experimental arm . ) Randomized control trial . Endpoints : Total operating time ( continuous ) Time delivery end surgery ( continuous ) Estimated blood loss ( continuous ) Post operative fever ( categorical ) Bladder injury ( categorical ) Pre- post-operative pain medication ( continuous ) Analog pain scale ( continuous ) 5 . Subject Selection ( Include enumeration inclusion exclusion criterion ) MAHEC patient present delivery Mission Hospitals require cesarean section Inclusion Exclusion Cesarean section All vaginal delivery ≥ 35 week gestation &lt; 35 week gestation Able provide consent medical treatment Urgent cesarean section Unable provide consent medical treatment Medical complication prohibitive bladder flap Medical complication prohibitive bladder flap 6 . Statistical method , data analysis interpretation ( Include factor consider determine appropriate sample size ) Sample size 100 per group base estimate mean difference 5 minute total operating time ( study arm 45±12.5 vs. bladder flap arm 50±12.5 ; Power=080 ; alpha=0.05 ; two-tailed ) .4 Per protocol analysis utilize analysis variance continuous variable chi square analysis categorical variable . 7 . Study Procedures ( Describe chronological flow study , use schematic diagram necessary . Distinguish clearly treatment-related [ medically-indicated ] research-related procedure subject undergo ) All OB patient present L &amp; D delivery approach informed consent . consent patient cesarean delivery medically indicate randomize bladder flap vs. none . Patients unable consent medical treatment wish consent project exclude . Consenting patient cesarean medically indicate randomly assign bladder flap vs. previously allocation subject number . Patients undergo assigned procedure unless exclude discretion surgeon determine alternate procedure medically indicate . Patients undergo assigned procedure data extract hospital medical record enter SPSS per-protocol analysis .</detailed_description>
