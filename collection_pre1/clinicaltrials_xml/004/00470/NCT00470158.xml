	<brief_title>Delivery Iron Zinc Supplements : Evaluation Interaction Effect Biochemical Clinical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron supplementation use reduce anemia improve hemoglobin status . Zinc supplementation emerge possibly efficacious preventive measure decrease incidence severe diarrhea . Previous study suggest interaction zinc iron give together , reduce effect supplementation mineral . One study Peru show decrease interaction effect separate supplementation iron zinc time compare iron administration alone placebo ; however , evaluation clinical outcome zinc iron status iron zinc administer separately compare supplementation zinc iron together alone previously do . This trial ass effect iron zinc supplementation give alternate day compare give together combine supplement . We propose randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled community trial child 6-23 month Mirzapur , Bangladesh . We recruit enroll 1000 child 6-23 month old permanent resident select village . Each child randomly assign 1 ) daily alternate zinc placebo 2 ) daily alternate iron/folic acid placebo 3 ) daily alternate zinc/iron/folic acid placebo 4 ) daily alternate zinc iron/folic acid 5 ) daily placebo . Primary outcome include incidence severe diarrhea , evaluate weekly 6 month , hemoglobin , prevalence anemia , serum zinc . Analysis data do compare effect separate iron zinc supplementation compare combine iron zinc supplementation well compare iron , zinc , placebo single supplementation . We evaluate difference incidence rate severe diarrhea , serum hemoglobin , percent anemia , serum zinc . Since randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial , difference effect likely explain time supplement dos . If improvement clinical biochemical outcome , would consistent decreased interaction absorption . If difference find , may another mechanism seem interaction iron zinc besides mutually inhibitory absorption intestine .</detailed_description>
