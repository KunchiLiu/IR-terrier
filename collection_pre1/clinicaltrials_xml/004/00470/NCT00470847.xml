	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety combine lapatinib plus radiation patient breast cancer spread brain . Depending upon participant cancer , may also stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . Lapatinib compound may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . It think lapatinib might also make cancer cell sensitive radiation . This drug use research study woman breast cancer , information research study suggest lapatinib may help shrink stabilize breast tumor inside brain outside brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Combination With Radiation Therapy Patients With Brain Metastases From HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participant 's give study medication-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last four week . On first day treatment cycle , participant take 1 lapatinib orally twice per day , 12 hour apart . After first day , lapatinib take day morning . - Whole brain radiation treatment begin approximately 1-8 day first dose lapatinib . The radiation treatment follow standard guideline supervise radiation oncologist . Radiation give 15 treatment period three week . - Some participant also undergo stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . SRS highly focus intense form radiation treatment generally do outpatient procedure single treatment . - After whole brain radiation treatment complete , lapatinib continue dose one week . After , lapatinib dose may change . In addition time , Herceptin start . Participants continue lapatinib herceptin together long evidence benefitting . - During treatment cycle participant physical exam ask general question health . Photographs take tumor , visible , assess response tumor treatment . An assessment tumor CT scan body , MRI image brain perform every two month . An assessment heart function MUGA scan echocardiogram perform every 8 week . The participant also ask complete brief questionnaire measuring quality life ask symptom related cancer baseline , 6 month , one year . Blood test perform every 4 week .</detailed_description>
