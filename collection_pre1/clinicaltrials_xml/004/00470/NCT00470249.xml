	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give carboplatin together gemcitabine work treat patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall response rate patient anthracycline- taxane-resistant locally advanced metastatic breast cancer treat dose-dense carboplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride . Secondary - Determine overall toxicity regimen patient . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine time treatment failure patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 150 minute day 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
