	<brief_title>Comparing Ibuprofen And Indomethacin For The Treatment Of The Patent Ductus Arteriosus Very Premature Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According Very Low Birth Weight ( VLBW ) High Risk Registration database KKWCH , hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) common problem premature infant bear gestational age 29 week , 50 % needing indomethacin treatment closure PDA . Prostaglandins play major role keep ductus patent . Indomethacin , anti-prostaglandin effect via inhibition prostaglandin form cyclo-oxygenase enzyme , use medically close PDA since 1970s . Concerns drug relate effect cerebral , renal gastrointestinal blood flow . Necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) , gastrointestinal perforation , gastrointestinal bleeding , transient permanent renal impairment reduce cerebral blood flow associate indomethacin . Ibuprofen treatment PDA report 1990s . It effective indomethacin closing PDA . It potentially well indomethacin regional blood flow affect . The trial do compare intravenous ibuprofen indomethacin involve mainly heavy low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant . In New England Journal Medicine editorial subject , Clyman point need trial involve immature infant look efficacy safety . The main obstacle ibuprofen use premature infant absence commercially available intravenous preparation . In propose trial new i.v . ibuprofen preparation manufacture Cumberland Pharmaceuticals ( Nashville , Tennessee ) use . A Cochrane systematic review ibuprofen treatment PDA premature infant conclude performed effectiveness compare indomethacin . There significant decrease incidence oliguria ibuprofen arm , high risk chronic lung disease 28 day life ( borderline statistical significance ) , 36 weeks.There biologically plausible explanation latter effect could attribute chance view , plus weak statistical proof . The problem review include trial enteral ibuprofen use , route clearly impractical premature infant plan study unpredictable absorption immature gut general intolerance feed early age . The concern regard pulmonary hypertension prophylactic use ibuprofen also apply plan study time administration drug around 24 hour age . The potential benefit stem ibuprofen 's biological advantage indomethacin reduction rate oliguria , gastrointestinal bleeding , NEC gastrointestinal perforation . NEC gastrointestinal perforation condition serious morbidity usually result prolonged hospital stay poorer neurodevelopmental outcome affect infant . A good drug could lead cost saving . Neurosensory impairment important outcome monitor indomethacin reduces cerebral blood flow . This point also emphasize Cochrane systematic review mention . However subject another proposal view significant additional budget need . The objective trial compare , safety efficacy intravenous ibuprofen treatment closure patent ductus arteriosus diagnose via 2D echocardiography premature baby bear 29 week gestation , traditional therapy indomethacin . The primary outcome measure incidence oliguria gastric bleeding within one week 1st dose treatment</detailed_description>
