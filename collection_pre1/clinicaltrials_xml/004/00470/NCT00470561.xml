	<brief_title>Effect Aspirin Mammogram Density Healthy Postmenopausal Women With Moderate High Level Breast Density</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) v placebo mammographic density healthy postmenopausal woman moderate high level breast density . Secondary - Determine whether differential response mammogram density aspirin treatment individual homozygous wild-type , heterozygous , homozygous variant several UGT gene polymorphism . - Determine effect aspirin therapy potential adverse event , include gastrointestinal symptom sign , bleed event , blood pressure , major comorbidities hospitalization , well generalize symptom , participant . - Determine effect aspirin therapy putative biomarkers breast ovarian cancer currently validate part ongoing Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Ovarian SPORE activity . - Determine effect aspirin therapy level serum estradiol , estrone sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) measure radioimmunoassay baseline 6 month timepoints OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) daily 6 month . - Arm II : Participants receive oral placebo daily 6 month . In arm , participant undergo repeat mammogram 6 month . Blood urine sample collect baseline 6 month . Single-nucleotide polymorphisms UGT gene variable number tandem repeat-type polymorphism genotyped . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 144 participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
