	<brief_summary>In research study study effect combination lapatinib plus Herceptin subject breast cancer spread outside breast . We also study whether positron emission tomography ( PET/CT ) scan predict participant benefit study treatment . Finally , study gene protein tumor tissue may lead sensitivity resistance Herceptin , combination Herceptin plus lapatinib . Lapatinib compound may stop cancer cell grow . Other research study suggest lapatinib combination Herceptin may help shrink stabilize breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Combination With Trastuzumab Patients With HER2-Positive , Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants ask undergo biopsy area body cancer spread . - Participants give study medication-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last four week time take lapatinib , per day . - Participants receive Herceptin every week every 3 week vein . - During treatment cycle physical exam perform question participant general health ask . Blood test include chemistry hematology perform measure additional effect study drug disease status . Photographs may take tumor ass response tumor treatment . - CT scan repeat every 8 week assess effect study treatment cancer . Either MUGA scan echocardiogram perform 8 week 16 week participant start study treatment . - Participants remain research study long benefit study treatment .</detailed_description>
