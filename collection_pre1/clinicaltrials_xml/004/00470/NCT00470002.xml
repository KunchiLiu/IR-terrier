	<brief_title>Effects Growth Hormone Nitric Oxide Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) potent endogenous vasodilator show inhibit key process atherosclerosis like monocyte adhesion , platelet aggregation , vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation . Impaired endothelial NO production main feature endothelial dysfunction , early step course atherosclerotic vascular disease . Recent study could confirm close association parameters NO pathway cardiovascular disease could enhance knowledge pathophysiological mechanism . There significant relationship insulin resistance endogenous NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) . Moreover , evidence could provide plasma level ADMA strong independent predictor mortality cardiovascular outcome haemodialysis patient . Patients growth hormone deficiency characterize 1.9 fold high risk death cardiovascular disease . Again , good evidence , alteration NO-pathway involved increase cardiovascular risk . A reduced endogenous systemic production NO find patient growth hormone deficiency , treatment recombinant growth hormone normalize NO production . The effect growth hormone NO possibly mediate insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , stimulate NO synthesis vitro . The onset IGF-I increase healthy volunteer treat GH evident 12 h , maximum effect take place 5 8 day . Also adults growth hormone deficiency , major effect growth hormone treatment IGF-I level observe within 2 week . After discontinuation growth hormone therapy , IGF-1 level return base line within 2-3 day . The aim present study elucidate vivo effect GH NO pathway NO mediate cardiovascular function .</detailed_description>
