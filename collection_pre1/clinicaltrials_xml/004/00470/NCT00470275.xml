	<brief_title>Cytarabine Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Ewing 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate young patient recurrent refractory Ewing 's sarcoma treat cytarabine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cytarabine IV 2 hour twice daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 11 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
