	<detailed_description>The optimal hemoglobin concentration transfusion perioperative setting patient cardiac surgery establish , red cell transfusion rate patient high . In recent retrospective study seven Canadian centre , include 11,812 cardiac surgical patient , 44 % patient receive one red cell unit , range patient transfuse 28 % 60 % . As morbidity mortality may dependent severity anemia administration transfusion , essential determine hemoglobin concentration physician transfuse patient , particularly efficacy transfusion establish . However , definitive trial require thousand patient , variability transfusion practice , preliminary study need complete ensure feasibility adherence propose transfusion strategy . This pilot study first two pilot trial design address question optimum hemoglobin concentration transfusion patient cardiac surgery prior undertake definitive randomize controlled trial . The purpose study determine adherence transfusion strategy .</detailed_description>
