	<detailed_description>Background : The triage patient suspect acute coronary syndrome emergency room time-consuming diagnostic challenge . Triage management patient low probability coronary artery disease often cause excessive hospital cost . Therefore high sensitive early marker myocardial damage need rapidly rule acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . Cardiac troponins ( T I ) currently gold standard definitive AMI diagnosis due high sensitivity specificity detection myocardial cell injury . Unfortunately , troponin undetectable current assay peripheral blood within 3 4 hour onset chest pain AMI ( `` troponin-blind '' period ) . New cardiac marker novel high-sensitive troponin I/T , ischemia modify albumin placental growth factor demonstrate certain advantage compare troponin high negative predictive value AMI , early verifiability peripheral blood possible value independent risk marker . However , clinical evaluation large cohort unselected patient present emergency department still lack . Aim : To test hypothesis use meticulous patient history novel cardiac marker ( include high-sensitive troponin I/T , myeloperoxidase , ischemia modify albumin , placental growth factor ) provide fast detection exclusion AMI patient present acute chest pain emergency department . Patients Methods : The prospective cohort study design enrol 1000 patient present acute chest pain rest within last 12 hour emergency department . Several blood sample detection new marker draw ( baseline , 1 , 2 , 3 6 hour ) compare gold standard diagnosis AMI ( troponin T ) . Timing treatment patient leave discretion attend physician perform accord standard house routine hospital . All patient contact telephone 6 , 12 24 month determine functional status , major adverse cardiac event ( death , myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary intervention ) , result cardiac examination ( stress test , coronary angiography ) perform . Expected result : It hypothesis use meticulous patient history novel cardiac marker improve detection AMI provide early diagnosis AMI high negative predictive value within `` troponin-blind '' period . Significance : The early detection myocardial necrosis peripheral blood could help rule AMI rapidly . In addition allow rapid diagnosis appropriate therapy AMI . This lead significant improvement patient management reduction in-hospital cost .</detailed_description>
