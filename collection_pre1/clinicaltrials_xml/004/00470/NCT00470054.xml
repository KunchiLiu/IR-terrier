	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE I . Determine efficacy dasatinib patient relapse small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE II . Determine objective response rate ( complete partial response ) patient treat drug . III . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
