	<brief_summary>Recent study show survival colorectal cancer diagnosis may affect person 's activity level body size . This research say colorectal cancer patient , less active obese , likely cancer recurrence die cancer . Chemotherapy show reduce activity level , fitness , body size cancer patient . However , know chemotherapy specific colon cancer patient affect activity level , fitness , body size . The main goal study look chemotherapy treatment affect fitness , activity level , body size colon cancer patient . In order , measure variable chemotherapy treatment , 1 6 month follow end treatment . Our result show chemotherapy affect fitness , activity level , body size colon cancer patient provide data help designing exercise intervention specifically colon cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Information : Recent evidence suggest physical activity level body composition colorectal cancer survivor impact disease-free overall survival follow diagnosis , individual overweight obese less active great risk recurrence die colorectal cancer ( Meyerhardt et al , 2006a , b ; Digman et al , 2006 ) . Chemotherapy treatment show improve survival number cancer population , unfortunately also show negatively impact numerous physiological psychological variable , include reduce exercise capacity , self-reported physical functioning activity level , negative change body composition ( Schmitz et al , 2005 ) . This suggest chemotherapy treatment may negatively impact variable associate survival individual diagnose colorectal cancer . However , research conduct cancer population colorectal cancer patient , hence specific impact chemotherapy treatment colorectal cancer outcome know . Objectives : The primary objective study determine effect chemotherapy treatment aerobic capacity body composition colon cancer patient . Secondary objective determine effect chemotherapy treatment quality life , fatigue , performance status , self-reported objectively measure physical functioning , exercise behaviour , oxygen uptake kinetics , muscular strength , anthropometric variable . Study Design : The study parameter assess include descriptive information demographic , lifestyle medical variable ; grade exercise test metabolic measurement determine peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) ; air-displacement plethysmography ( BOD POD ) test anthropometric measurement ( waist &amp; hip circumference , waist-to-hip ratio , body mass index ) ass body composition ; questionnaire determine cancer-specific quality life fatigue ( Functional Assessment Cancer Treatment - Colorectal Fatigue ) ; performance status assessment ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ) ; self-reported ( Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Physical Function Scale ) objectively measure ( Physical Functional Performance-10 Senior 's Fitness Tests ) physical functioning ; self-reported exercise behavior ( Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire ) ; submaximal exercise test metabolic measurement determine oxygen uptake kinetics ; 8-repetition maximum test ass upper ( bench press ) low ( leg press ) body muscular strength ; fast blood sample use future biomarkers assay . All assessment complete baseline prior subject 's first chemotherapy infusion , 1 6 month completion chemotherapy infusion . The following calculation use estimate require sample size base primary outcome aerobic capacity ( Peak Oxygen Consumption ; VO2peak ) : n = 2 + C ( s/d ) 2 ( Snedecor et al , 1989 ) , C constant equal 7.85 power 0.80 alpha 0.05 , standard deviation 6.0 ml/kg/min , 3.5 ml/kg/min difference group . Therefore , sample size 25 subject require detect 1 Metabolic Equivalent ( MET ) 3.5 ml/kg/min reduction VO2peak colorectal cancer survivor follow completion chemotherapy treatment , standard deviation ( SD ) oxygen consumption 6.0 ml/kg/min , power 0.80 , alpha set p &lt; 0.05 ( two-tailed ) . Each 1 MET change exercise capacity positively associate 12 % difference overall survival general population ( Myers et al , 2002 ) . A sample 30 subject recruit account subject lose follow-up . To compare effect chemotherapy treatment study assessment colon cancer surgery alone , 10 subject recruit complete study assessment 3 time point allow `` surgery '' comparison group . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Inclusion criterion include : 1 ) histologically confirm colon cancer ( Stage III Stage II patient deem high-risk 2 ) approval treat oncologist 3 ) receive chemotherapy 4 ) able understand provide write informed consent English 5 ) 18+ year age 6 ) uncontrolled co-morbidities ( include hypertension , cardiac illness , psychiatric condition , etc . ) negative ECG assess maximal graded exercise test *Ten patient meet eligibility requirement except criterion 3 recruit study serve `` surgery '' control . Exclusion criterion include 1 ) metastatic recurrent colon cancer patient ; 2 ) pregnancy ; 3 ) uncontrolled medical condition would contraindication exercise ( assessed treat oncologist ) ; 4 ) unwilling attend , travel , participate assessment 3 time point . Recruitment : Patients recruit outpatient colorectal clinic Cross Cancer Institute . The project coordinator present clinic , conjunction treat oncologist clinic nurse screen patient list determine eligibility day . The treat medical oncologist final determination patient eligibility study introduce trial patient deem meet eligibility requirement . If patient express interest , approach project coordinator discus study detail also give patient study information package . The patient tell follow-up phone call make next day confirm patient interested participate trial . If patient still interested , baseline test appointment schedule . Based estimate 8 new colon cancer patient eligible study clinic per week 15 % accrual rate , take approximately 36 week recruit require number subject ( n = 30 ) . Statistical Analysis : Data analyze use SPSS version 15.0 software ( SPSS , Inc. , Evanston , IL ) . The principal analyse end point employ last observation carry forward approach . Independent t-tests use test variable differentiate patient accepting/declining participation completing/dropping study . Descriptive statistic use summarize study assessment data time point . The change measure outcomes baseline post-chemotherapy ( 4 week post ) recovery ( 24 week post-chemotherapy ) analyse use one-way analysis variance repeat measure . Any difference study outcomes subject receive chemotherapy versus receive surgery alone analyse use two-way analysis variance repeat measure . Stopping Rules : Subjects free withdraw study time , include stop point study assessment . Data Safety Monitoring Committee : Ethical scientific approval obtain Alberta Cancer Board Health Ethics Research Board University Alberta . All data number cod identity participant trace . All data keep secure , lock cabinet Behavioral Medicine Laboratory accessible member research team . The local Institutional Research Ethics Boards oversee validity integrity data conduct periodic audit study record . The safety participant primary concern time . Study investigator monitor participant study assessment . All adverse event , however minor , record . All serious adverse event report local Institutional Research Ethics Boards , well participant 's treating oncologist . The project coordinator , supervision principal investigator , responsible report serious adverse event .
