	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A low-calorie diet and/or exercise program may help low overweight obese postmenopausal woman 's risk develop breast cancer . It yet know whether low-calorie diet and/or exercise program effective diet exercise program lowering overweight obese postmenopausal woman 's risk develop breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study effect low-calorie diet and/or exercise program risk factor develop breast cancer compare diet exercise program overweight obese postmenopausal woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect 1-year exercise intervention , reduced-calorie diet intervention , combine exercise reduced-calorie diet intervention v intervention serum estrone concentration overweight obese postmenopausal woman . Secondary - Compare effect intervention serum level estradiol free estradiol participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level testosterone free testosterone participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level sex hormone bind globulin participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level insulin participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level glucose participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level c-peptide participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-1 ) participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level insulin-like growth factor binding-protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level c-reactive protein ( CRP ) participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level serum amyloid protein A ( SAA ) participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level adiponectin participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level leptin participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level ghrelin participant . - Compare effect intervention serum level Vitamin D participant . - Compare effect intervention mammographic density participant . - Compare effect intervention anthropometrics body composition ( i.e. , weight , body mass index , total percentage body fat , waist hip circumference ) participant . - Compare effect intervention quality life participant . - Compare effect intervention number leukocyte neutrophile participant . - Compare effect intervention VO2max participant . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Participants stratify accord body mass index ( &lt; 30 v ≥ 30 ) . Participants randomize 1 4 intervention arm . - Arm I ( exercise program ) : Participants exercise 3 day per week supervision physiologist 2 day per week independently home , total 5 exercise session ( least 45 minute moderate-intensity exercise per session ) weekly 12 month . - Arm II ( reduced-calorie diet ) : Participants meet nutritionist individually small group . Participants receive general information diet behavior strategy self-monitoring , goal-setting , stimulus-control , problem-solving , relapse-prevention training . Participants learn set calorie goal fat gram goal achieve goal calorie reduction . Meetings hold weekly first 6 month diet program taper course study . - Arm III ( exercise program reduced-calorie diet ) : Participants meet physiologist nutritionist , arm I II , exercise diet accordingly . - Arm IV ( control : delay diet exercise ) : Participants receive study material healthy diet exercise end 12-month study period . In addition , participant offer 2 month group exercise training study physiologist 4 group meeting nutritionist learn weight loss technique behavioral principle achieve weight loss . All participant undergo test baseline periodically study . Participants undergo blood collection evaluation serum level sex metabolic hormone ( e.g. , estrone , estradiol , testosterone , free testosterone , sex hormone bind globulin , radioimmunoassay immunoassay . Participants also undergo anthropometrics body composition measurement mammographic density assessment . Participants complete questionnaire baseline 6 12 month assessment diet exercise . Quality life ( QOL ) measure baseline 6 12 month use Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Impact Weight QOL questionnaire . Information health habit , medical history , family history breast cancer , reproductive menstrual history also collect . FINAL ACCRUAL : A total 439 participant ( 118 caloric restriction arm , 117 CR+Exercise , exercise arm ; 87 control arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
