	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose photodynamic therapy use HPPH treat patient undergo surgery primary recurrent head neck cancer . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use drug , HPPH , become active expose certain kind light . When drug active , tumor cell kill . Giving photodynamic therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using HPPH Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery Primary Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Identifying maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PDT among 4 investigated light dose level ( 30 , 50 , 60 75 ) combination surgery patient recurrent primary head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To make initial observation efficacy ( i.e. , tumor recurrence rate ) adjuvant PDT patient . II . To determine HPPH uptake distribution ( feasible ) recurrent resect specimen . III . Observe wind complication . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study laser light . Patients receive HPPH intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Patients undergo surgery follow laser light exposure entire tumor bed day 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month periodically thereafter discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
