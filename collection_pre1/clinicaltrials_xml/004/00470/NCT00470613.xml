	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib study continuation original Phase I protocol . The purpose Phase Ib study evaluate safety single course SGT-53 combination docetaxel determine recommend Phase II dose SGT-53 docetaxel combination evaluation subsequent clinical study treatment solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Infusion SGT-53 Treat Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The p53 gene vital tumor suppressor gene human . Numerous human tumor possess loss mutation wild type p53 ( wtp53 ) . In addition play crucial role cell cycle control , p53 gene critical component two pathway involve regulate tumor cell growth : cell death ( apoptosis ) regulation angiogenesis . The loss critical tumor suppressor activity believe responsible p53 's involvement broad array human tumor resistance chemo/radiotherapy . SGT-53 complex compose wild type p53 gene ( plasmid DNA ) encapsulate liposome targeted tumor cell mean anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody fragment ( TfRscFv ) attach outside liposome . Pre-clinical study indicate SGT-53 could sensitize tumor effect radiation/chemotherapy . The Phase 1a portion clinical study design evaluate safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SGT-53 . In addition , pharmacokinetics escalate dos SGT-53 measure correlated tumor response toxicity . The Phase Ib portion clinical study design evaluate safety SGT-53 combination docetaxel , determine recommend Phase II dose two agent , evaluate effect combination SGT-53 docetaxel tumor size progression .</detailed_description>
