	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy L-Ornithine L-Aspartate Infusion Patients With Acute Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute liver failure ( ALF ) high mortality . However , survive recover completely without sequel . Liver transplantation logistically financially difficult country high disease burden . It also entail lifelong commitment immunosuppression . We therefore need new treatment option improve survival medically manage patient ALF . Ammonia believe major neurotoxin ALF . There experimental evidence direct indirect ammonia neurotoxicity ALF . The brain urea cycle , relies glutamine synthesis astrocyte removal excess ammonia . Increased intracellular glutamine astrocytes lead cellular swell . Increased brain ammonia concentration also result altered expression key astrocyte proteins include glial fibrillary acidic protein , glutamate glycine transporter `` peripheral-type '' ( mitochondrial ) BZD receptor . Accumulation ammonia brain result redistribution cerebral blood flow cortical sub-cortical structure , also direct effect neurotransmission . Increased ammonia concentration upregulates peripheral-type benzodiazepine ( PTBR ) receptor outer membrane astroglial mitochondrion , enhance synthesis release neurosteroids , know GABA ( A ) receptor agonist . There evidence high blood ammonia level ALF , substantial blood-to-brain ammonia transfer.Brain-blood ammonia concentration ratio ( normally order 2 ) increase 4 fold liver failure . Higher ammonia level co-related high mortality complication human clinical trial . Clemmesen et al find ALF patient die cerebral herniation high ammonia level compare survivor . We also previously show high ammonia level admission predict poor survival rate , arterial ammonia level independent predictor mortality logistic regression analysis . An arterial ammonia level &gt; 124 μmol/l find predict mortality 78.6 % sensitivity 76.3 % specificity.There thus strong rationale use ammonia lower therapy ALF . LOLA compound salt Ornithine Aspartate . The mechanism ammonia lower action define . LOLA provide critical substrate urea glutamine synthesis- key pathway ammonia detoxification liver . Urea synthesis carry low affinity , high capacity system exist largely periportal hepatocytes . In cell , Ornithine serve activator ornithine-carbamoyltransferase carbamylphosphate-synthetase . In addition , Ornithine act substrate urea genesis . Hence LOLA activate periportal urea cycle . Glutamine synthesis high affinity , relatively low capacity system locate perivenous hepatocytes . Ornithine convert α -ketoglutarate , take perivenous hepatocytes serve carbon source glutamine synthesis . LOLA also upregulates glutamine synthesis skeletal muscle via glutamine synthetase ( GS ) . Recently , animal model increase transport ornithine across blood brain barrier increase brain glutamine synthesis LOLA treatment describe , suggest LOLA may centrally ( CNS ) peripherally mediate effect . , LOLA show reduce raise ammonia level experimental model hyper-ammonemia , human cirrhotic patient . In patient cirrhosis , LOLA improve psychometric performance improve mental status . LOLA therefore promise agent use ALF patient . It scientific rationale find effective cirrhosis . There however single experimental study LOLA rat model acute liver injury . LOLA infusion could normalize plasma ammonia lead significant reduction brain water content . We would like study whether LOLA infusion patient ALF reduce ammonia level improve survival .</detailed_description>
