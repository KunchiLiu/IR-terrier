	<brief_title>CALERIE : Comprehensive Assessment Long-Term Effects Reducing Intake Energy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim CALERIE Phase 2 test hypothesis two year sustain caloric restriction ( CR ) , involve reduction energy intake 75 % baseline ( 25 % CR ) , healthy , non-obese men age 21-50 ( inclusive ) woman age 21-47 ( inclusive ) , result adaptive change observe wide variety animal study . Particular emphasis adaptive response think involve slow age process protect age-related disease process . Primary outcome include core body temperature rest metabolic rate . Secondary outcome include risk factor cardiovascular disease , inflammatory marker , immune function , psychological physical function ; oxidative change lipid , protein , DNA ; , risk factor age-related condition diabetes body composition . An important secondary aim identify potential adverse effect CR human . The study conduct multi-center , parallel-group , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . A sample 200 participant enrol , assign either CR intervention control group . Control participant advise simply continue current diet . Participants treatment arm follow period 24 month .
