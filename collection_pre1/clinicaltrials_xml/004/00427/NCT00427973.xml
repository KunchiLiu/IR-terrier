	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I. Assess progression free survival patient locally advance unresectable metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treat AZD2171 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . II . Determine , preliminarily , efficacy drug , term response rate , duration response , overall survival , patient . III . Determine blood flow change vascular permeability tumor patient treat drug . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) MRI CT perfusion scan liver perform baseline , 72 hour initial dose AZD2171 , end course 1 . Blood sample pharmacokinetic study collect periodically study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
