	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether shift time biological clock later hour ( phase delay shift human circadian system ) produce response four successive evening light exposure , whether phase shift result great even alertness great nighttime sleep efficiency . Three different light source compare : 1 ) standard fluorescent light ; 2 ) blue-enriched light ; 3 ) incandescent fluorescent light .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The endogenous circadian pacemaker ( natural biological rhythm 24-hour cycle ) major determinant time sleep sleep structure human . There considerable data animal human suggest property circadian pacemaker change advance age . It hypothesize change may underlie sleep disruption reduction daytime alertness observe elderly . Recent study confirm impact endogenous circadian phase REM sleep ( Rapid Eye Movement -- period sleep associate dream ) reveal high sleep efficiency maintain unique phase-relationship sleep episode endogenous circadian phase . This phase-relationship even small change relative timing circadian pacemaker daily sleep episode large impact individual 's ability consolidate sleep throughout night , especially old individual . In field-laboratory study , participant first monitor 3 week live home self-selected sleep-wake schedule . They enter laboratory 13-day study . The laboratory study begin 3 baseline day live habitual schedule , participant allow leave hospital day , return evening . After 3-day baseline , initial circadian phase estimate constant posture ( CP protocol ) . This follow 4-day light treatment , participant expose approximately 2 hour light session even . As baseline , participant allow leave hospital daytime hour , return early evening . Following 4-day treatment , second CP conduct . After CP , 3-day laboratory follow take place ( similar baseline ) , follow ambulatory follow-up , participant monitor actigraphy monitor 3 week live home ( ambulatory baseline ) . Sleep polysomnographically record ( oxygen saturation , electrocardiography , air flow , respiratory effort , limb movement , eye jaw muscle movement , brain electrical activity ) night laboratory , blood sample collect CP phase circadian rhythm melatonin secretion assess , activity monitoring continue ambulatory baseline ambulatory follow-up . Tests performance alertness conduct time participant awake laboratory .</detailed_description>
