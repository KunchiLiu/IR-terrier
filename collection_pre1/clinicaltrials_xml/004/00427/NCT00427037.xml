	<brief_summary>This 12 week pilot feasibility study enrollment goal 30 subject . Half subject randomize vitamin D3 half receive placebo . Subjects refer nutrition renal clinic Emory . CKD stage 3 4 patient eligible participation determine vitamin D deficiency treatment vitamin D vitamin D analogue . Subjects sign inform consent form review protocol detail principal investigator . A questionnaire would collect information dietary vitamin D intake , sunlight exposure , symptom vitamin D deficiency . The subject baseline level serum vitamin D ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D ) , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , serum calcium phosphate , creatinine marker bone turnover . The questionnaire blood draw would repeat 6th 12th week study . Subjects give 12 pill contain either 50,000 IU vitamin D placebo ask take one pill week . They would schedule return clinic 6 week blood measurement would repeat . Subjects ask revisit final visit 12th week would last blood draw assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D supplementation reduce secondary hyperparathyroidism chronic kidney disease patient , stage 3 4 : A randomized , placebo control pilot study Problem interest Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) patient suffer severe metabolic bone disease , represent formidable challenge physician . Defective vitamin D metabolism , secondary parathyroid activation suggest possible cause . Vitamin D important musculoskeletal health . Vitamin D obtain diet make skin exposure sunlight , convert kidney calcitriol , active form order effective . Decreased kidney mass CKD patient cause reduced capability convert vitamin D calcitriol due less 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme level . Current standard care patient chronic renal disease treatment vitamin D analogues Rocaltrol Hectoral . However , medication potential cause hypercalcemia . Studies show calcitriol production become dependent 25- hydroxyvitamin D availability moderate CKD patient . There speculation still `` reserve '' leave generation calcitriol vitamin D patient . The main question pose study : Primary : Can weekly high dose supplementation cholecalciferol effective raise 25 ( OH ) D level patient CKD reduce parathyroid hormone level pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patient ? Study Design This 12 week pilot feasibility study enrollment goal 30 subject . Half subject randomize vitamin D3 half receive placebo . Subjects refer nutrition renal clinic Emory . CKD stage 3 4 patient eligible participation determine vitamin D deficiency treatment vitamin D vitamin D analogue . Subjects sign inform consent form review protocol detail principal investigator . A questionnaire would collect information dietary vitamin D intake , sunlight exposure , symptom vitamin D deficiency . The subject baseline level serum vitamin D ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D ) , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , serum calcium phosphate , creatinine marker bone turnover . The questionnaire blood draw would repeat 6th 12th week study . Subjects give 12 pill contain either 50,000 IU vitamin D3 placebo ask take one pill week . They would schedule return clinic 6 week blood measurement would repeat . Subjects ask revisit final visit 12th week would last blood draw assessment . Treatment This randomize control trial . Only half subject receive vitamin D treatment half placebo . If end study , subject still vitamin D deficiency , refer endocrinologist primary doctor treatment . Scientific advancement If successful , study would provide necessary preliminary data order conduct large randomize control study supplement vitamin D chronic kidney disease patient . One potential area study would see whether subject supplement vitamin D able raise active vitamin D level use `` reserve '' hydroxylase enzyme kidney compare subject supplement placebo . This study necessary order determine whether weekly intake high dose vitamin D sufficient decrease parathyroid hormone level give time frame .</detailed_description>
