	<brief_title>PRO-STATE : Search Protein Profile Corresponding Fast-developing Lesions Characterization Implicated Proteins Prostate Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In men , prostate carcinoma first cancer second cause death cancer . It slowly evolve disease prognostic marker poor outcome . Currently , Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) available biological marker . It tissue marker tumoral pathology control . This new tissue marker urgently need select patient unfavourable evolution , order treat rapidly effective method chemotherapy , hormonotherapy radiotherapy . This could improve survival time quality life . Proteomic clinical data comparison could point new relevant molecule permit development new biological test routine use . SELDI-TOF-MS ( Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry ) permit extremely sensitive analysis protein . This method substantially ratify literature number marker already identify , particularly several cancer pathology . As far prostate carcinoma concern , previous proteomic research serum lead diagnostic parameter , differentiate healthy patient , patient benign lesion patient malignant lesion . However , present , relevant protein identify . Moreover , study carry characterize fast-developing lesion , order anticipate response treatment . The main objective study realise serum protein profile patient undergo prostate biopsy identify relevant protein . The main judgement criterion intensity peak protein profile ( area height ) reference combine criterion ( PSA rate , clinical stage , Gleason score ) . Two group compare : - Group 1 : Control ( negative biopsy ) . - Group 2 : Prostate carcinoma ( positive biopsy ) . This group subdivide : - Group 2a : favourable prognostic accord AMICO classification - Group 2b : intermediate unfavourable prognostic accord AMICO classification This contribute set aftercare database combine clinical data biological data protein profile .</detailed_description>
