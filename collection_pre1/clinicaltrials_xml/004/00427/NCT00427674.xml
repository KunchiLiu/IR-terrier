	<detailed_description>All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 10 ( 6 -Part A 4 - Part B ) healthy subject 10 PD subject recruit IND database , patient spouse , community participate protocol . The study doctor discus study procedure evaluate subject eligibility . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation . Following bolus intravenous injection 5 mCi 123-I mZINT 15 second , serial dynamic SPECT brain acquisition obtain evaluate regional brain uptake washout activity . Venous blood measure obtain acquisition characterization 123-I mZINT metabolite assess . Safety assessment include vital sign , serum chemistry , CBC , urinalysis , EKG . Vital sign assess pre-injection baseline 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 minute follow infusion 123-I mZINT . An EKG obtain baseline 20 40 min post 123-I mZINT injection . Adverse event assess vital sign obtain . Clinical laboratory test perform baseline injection include follow : serum chemistry battery , complete blood count differential , urinalysis .</detailed_description>
