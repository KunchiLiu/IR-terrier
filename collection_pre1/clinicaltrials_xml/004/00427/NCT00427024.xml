	<brief_title>Renal Transporters After Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After renal transplantation , cause ischemia rejection , often renal transport process disturb . These dysfunction similar Fanconi syndrome well renal tubular acidosis occur early phase transplantation . Irreversible injury develop cause nephrotoxicity immunosuppressant renal transplant artery stenosis . Although impact clinical follow prognosis transplant , , still clarify mechanism tubular transport process impaired . In animal model , demonstrate first , expression membrane protein specifically modulate early transplantation , indicate change expression function model due general necrosis apoptosis . Second , result differ data obtain ischemia / reperfusion . Third , regulatory pattern seem consequence systemic effect . We suppose change expression transporter receptor transplantation rejection continuously modulate , may influence prognosis graft . The data suggest transplantation acute rejection lead ischemia-independent change regulation transporter along nephron ( Velic A , Gabriëls G , Hirsch JR , Schröter R , Edemir B , Paasche S , Schlatter E. Acute rejection rat renal transplantation lead downregulation Na+ water channel collect duct . Am J Transplant . 2005 , 5 : 1276-85 .

J Am Soc Nephrol . 2004 , 15 : 967-77 ) . By mean microarray analysis examine expression gene renal transplantation rat . Of 18.000 gene , model acute rejection 55 % gene change expression compare control , transplantation without rejection induce change expression 30 % gene . With rejection , 50 % gene upregulated 50 % downregulated . The regulated gene classify different group . An essential part gene upregulated rejection , expect , point massive immune response . With rejection , large amount gene cod protein transport activity protein involve metabolism downregulated ( e.g . amino acid transport , glucose transport , K+- , Ca++- phosphate transport , transport water , pH regulation ) . It show , rejection , signal transduction pathway involve protein catabolism immune response upregulated . By present study renal biopsy 200 transplanted individual acute rejection chronic transplant nephropathy , intend examine regulation transport system regulatory factor period two year . Our hypothesis activity transporter along nephron change renal transplantation , acute rejection reaction , chronic transplant nephropathy . We intend investigate underlying mechanism renal biopsy specimen obtain patient acute rejection reaction chronic transplant nephropathy . The study design analyze whether renal transport system factor find differentially regulate rat regulate similarly transplant rejection transplant nephropathy man . The finding obtain study also indispensable regard plain comprehension development tubule dysfunction renal transplantation man . The examination material serve explore basic pathophysiological mechanism rejection transplant nephropathy . Details Individuals renal transplant renal biopsy indicate clinical reason inform aim course study well potential risk complication biopsy procedure . Then ask participate . Should patient decide participation , make aware potential risk complication biopsy procedure use official information sheet hospital biopsy procedures special information sheet affiliate study document . After read information sheet , patient ask sign agreement . With patients´ approval , two specimen renal transplant obtain . The Patient monitor 24 hour clinically blood pressure measurement , urinalysis well ultrasound scan . If complaint control alright , patient may check hospital ask return control examination one week later . At presentation physician familiar study examine patient clinically ultrasound . The level electrolytes , BUN serum-creatinine detect venous blood gas analysis perform . In case regard consequence biopsy everything fine , study finish patient . He ask present , new symptom arise . While one part specimens obtain diagnostics prepare study gene expression immediately biopsy procedure , transport institute pathology work usual .</detailed_description>
