	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether give capecitabine together oxaliplatin effective standard follow-up care treat rectal cancer remove surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study capecitabine oxaliplatin see well work compare standard follow-up care treat patient undergone surgery locally advance rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Standard Follow-Up Care Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy adjuvant chemotherapy comprise capecitabine oxaliplatin vs standard follow-up care , term disease-free overall survival , patient clear margin complete resection locally advanced rectal cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , control , prospective , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord surgeon nodal status ( node positive v node negative v unknown ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard follow . - Arm II : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 800 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
