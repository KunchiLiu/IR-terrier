	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) preparative regimen rituximab , etoposide total body irradiation ( TBI ) , patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . Secondary Objectives : - To determine effect rituximab incidence acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) . - To determine efficacy add imatinib mesylate post transplant ALL patient ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) cytogenetic abnormality . - To estimate probability molecular complete remission one year describe treatment approach determine serial minimal residual disease ( MRD ) monitoring . - To determine rate GVHD , engraftment , toxicity , overall survival ( OS ) treatment regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disease relapse GVHD 2 factor significantly impact survival ALL patient receive SCT . GVHD occur donor cell ( graft ) attack stem cell recipient 's ( host 's ) cell . The term `` acute '' refers time take GVHD appear transplant . This time frame usually within first 100 day transplant . GVHD occur 50 % patient receive transplant . Etoposide traditional chemotherapy drug design interfere production cancer cell DNA RNA level . Total body irradiation ( TBI ) use low level radiation also interfere production cancer cell DNA RNA level . The combination etoposide TBI standard transplant conditioning therapy use ALL patient . Rituximab monoclonal antibody design work cell express antigen CD20 . In addition , study suggest may decrease risk GVHD . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam , include routine blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine test . You chest x-ray , heart scan ( echocardiogram MUGA scan ( Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ) ) , lung function test , bone marrow biopsy aspirate evaluate status disease transplant . To collect bone marrow biopsy aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . A bone marrow core ( solid piece bone marrow ) also collect hollow needle insert hip bone . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . Participants one group receive etoposide TBI transplant . Participants group receive etoposide , TBI , rituximab transplant . There equal chance assign either group . You receive treatment study inpatient . On 1st day hospitalization , receive fluid vein central venous catheter ( plastic tube insert large vein collar bone ) . You receive TBI , day next 4 day . During TBI , lie flat table receive radiation beam part body , shield certain part body . On follow day , receive etoposide catheter 4 hour . You 2 day rest , follow transplant stem cell . The stem cell infuse vein . The infusion last 30 minute several hour . If assign rituximab group , also receive rituximab week 4 week vein 4-8 hour . The first dose give first day receive etoposide . If receive mismatched-related allogeneic stem cell transplant unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant , also receive Thymoglobulin vein 3 day stem cell infusion . This give decrease risk GVHD graft rejection mismatch transplant . In addition , may receive supportive care drug call palifermin ( KepivanceÂ® ) , human keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) produce recombinant DNA technology E. coli . Its use show decrease mucositis result high dose chemotherapy use stem cell transplantation . You may receive palifermin 3 day start radiation therapy , 2 day begin day stem cell infusion . You may receive palifermin still receive transplant . After blood count normalize follow stem cell transplant , start take imatinib mesylate mouth disease Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph+ ALL ) . Approximately 25-30 % adult ALL harbor Philadelphia chromosome . You take day 1 year transplant . Imatinib mesylate take meal glass water , preferably morning . The dose gradually increase long n't experience severe side effect . If severe side effect occur , imatinib stop , either temporarily permanently . You receive several medication help treatment work help decrease risk infection immune system weak . Tacrolimus methotrexate give decrease risk GVHD . The tacrolimus start day transplant continue 6 month . Tacrolimus give vein first mouth able eat . Methotrexate give vein Days 1 , 3 , 6 , 11 transplant . Sulfamethoxazole ( Bactrim ) pentamidine give fight bacteria . Bactrim give mouth blood count good . Pentamidine give vein count low . Acyclovir give first vein Valtrex ( valacyclovir ) give mouth decrease risk viral infection . Both give per standard care . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) give help new bone marrow grow . It give injection skin transplant . It continue white blood cell reach acceptable level . These routine supportive medication use bone marrow transplantation . Overall , drug give long 6 month possibly longer . Other medication may necessary . If allergic drug , change make . You hospital 3-4 week . You checkups every day discharge hospital . You see outpatient clinic least 3 time week blood count improve . You see doctor least every week 100 day bone marrow transplant . You must stay Houston time . After 100 day , required return Houston every 3 month test evaluation next 2 year . At visit , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You also bone marrow biopsy . Some participant may need receive spinal tap chemotherapy ( methotrexate cytarabine give spine ) several time year transplantation . This patient previous clinical history leukemic involvement brain high risk develop leukemia relapse brain . The spinal tap perform clinic . If one participant , give local anesthetic low back site small needle inserted space 2 spinal bone . A small amount fluid bathe brain ( cerebrospinal fluid ) remove test , small amount chemotherapy give . This investigational study . The FDA approve drug use study use stem cell transplantation . However , use together study experimental . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
