	<brief_summary>SIRS trial large simple study high-risk patient undergo cardiac surgery require use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) randomly allocate receive pulse dose Methylprednisolone matching placebo . Cardiopulmonary bypass initiate systemic inflammatory response facilitate development post-operative complication . SIRS confirm deny potential clinical benefit suppress response use systemic steroid . Specifically , 250 mg intravenous Methylprednisolone give twice , anesthetic induction CPB initiation , result improve early survival less myocardial infarction high-risk cardiac surgery patient require CPB ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) commonly perform surgical procedure 500,000 per year North America . CPB initiate systemic inflammatory response characterize cell protein activation . Platelets , neutrophil , monocyte , macrophage , coagulation , fibrinolytic , kallikrein cascade take part result increase endothelial permeability , vascular , parenchymal damage . These inflammatory pathway facilitate development post-operative complication include thrombosis , myocardial injury infarction , respiratory failure , renal neurological dysfunction , bleed disorder , alter liver function ultimately , multiple organ failure . In attempt minimize deleterious effect CPB , investigator test variety strategy cardiac surgery range complete avoidance CPB , use biocompatible circuit pharmacologic agent abrogate systemic response . Investigators consistently demonstrate efficacy steroid potent anti-inflammatory agent use CPB . In fact , available evidence , 2004 AHA guideline coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) `` support liberal prophylactic use patient undergoing extracorporeal circulation '' . However , trial exist within literature focus biochemical endpoint insufficiently power make conclusion hard clinical endpoint . Our pilot RCT , SIRS I , demonstrate efficacy low dose steroid protocol suppression inflammatory cascade . We hypothesize low dose protocol yield clinical benefit avoid potential adverse effect steroid know dose dependent . The primary aim SIRS trial determine perioperative pulse dose Methylprednisolone result improve early survival less myocardial infarction cardiac surgery require CPB . Additional secondary aim SIRS trial determine effect steroid clinical outcome include length stay , new onset atrial fibrillation , transfusion requirement , infectious , wound , gastrointestinal complication . The design SIRS trial prospective multicentre international double-blind placebo control randomized clinical trial . The sample size 7500 patient 80 % 90 % power detect 20-30 % RRR primary outcome α=0.05 ( two-sided ) , anticipate 6 % rate death control arm . Our aim 85 international center participate , recruit 5 patient per month , would complete recruitment 36 month . This large trial simple design objective outcome . A sub-group patient enrol renal sub-study . This sub-study determine risk acute kidney injury low patient treat intravenous steroid versus placebo , steroid lead good preservation kidney function six month cardiac surgery , whether impact steroid exposure differs patient without pre-operative chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
