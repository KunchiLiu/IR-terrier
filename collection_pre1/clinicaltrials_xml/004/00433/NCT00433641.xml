	<brief_summary>Control food intake , size frequency meal critical development obesity . The stomach signal feeling fullness meal therefore plays role control calorie intake . It unclear whether approve appetite reduce drug sibutramine change function stomach . Differences way individual respond treatment appetite suppressant sibutramine may also explain people lose weight others . In previous study 48 overweight obese participant , preliminarily observe variation gene promoter serotonin transporter protein significantly associate degree weight loss . This new single center clinical study aim evaluate effect FDA-approved appetite suppress medication , sibutramine ( MERIDIA ) weight loss stomach empty patient overweight obese . The effect individual difference inherit gene modify serrotonin noradrenergic receptor weight reduction sibutramine test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weight Loss Response Sibutramine ( MERIDIA ) Influenced Inherited Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : . Genetic variation potentially key inter-individual difference response treatment appetite suppressant sibutramine . Overall Aims : To evaluate influence genetic variation candidate adrenergic serotonergic control mechanisms weight loss gastric empty response sibutramine obesity . Methods : 180 overweight obese ( respectively BMI 25-29.9 30 kg/m2 ) people treat sibutramine ( 10 15 mg/day ) placebo 12 wks . We shall collect DNA venous blood sample study entry , use SERT-P genotype baseline stratify patient accord LL v LS/SS genotype obese overweight group . The primary outcome measurement association clinical response ( weight loss ) influence SERT-P 2-MSP variation . A secondary outcome descriptive purpose gastric empty response sibutramine treatment . Gastric empty solid measure use stable isotope method . Anticipated Results : SERT-P genotype significantly associate magnitude weight loss obese overweight individual . Significance : Our study provide first evidence pharmacogenomic effect sibutramine weight loss obesity appraise association weight loss change gastric emptying .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Normal weight , overweight obese subject BMI &gt; 18 Kg/m2 residing Olmsted County , MN : Otherwise healthy individual currently treatment cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , hematological , neurological , endocrine ( hyperglycemia require medical therapy ) unstable psychiatric disease . Age : 1865 year Gender : Men woman . Women childbearing potential negative pregnancy test within 48 h enrollment radiation exposure . Weight exceed 300 pound 137 kilogram ( due limitation regard SPECT image study ) . Abdominal surgery appendectomy , Caesarian section tubal ligation . Positive history chronic gastrointestinal disease , systemic disease could affect gastrointestinal motility use medication may alter gastrointestinal motility , appetite absorption e.g. , orlistat ( Xenical &amp; # 61650 ; ) . Significant psychiatric dysfunction base upon screen Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [ HADS ] selfadministered alcoholism screen test ( substance abuse ) questionnaire eat weight pattern ( binge eat disorder bulimia ) . If dysfunction identify HADS score &gt; 8 difficulty substance eat disorder , participant exclude give referral letter his/her primary care doctor appraisal followup . Intake medication , whether prescribed OTC medication ( except multivitamin ) within 7 day study . Exceptions birth control pill , estrogen replacement therapy , thyroxine replacement . Concomitant use MAOI inhibitor centrally act appetite suppressant ( since would make ineligible sibutramine treatment ) . Hypersensitivity sibutramine ( since would make ineligible sibutramine treatment ) .</criteria>
