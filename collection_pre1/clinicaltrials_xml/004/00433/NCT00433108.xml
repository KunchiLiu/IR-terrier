	<brief_summary>A Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , parallel design trial two dose mitoquinone mesylate ( MitoQ ) placebo patient chronic Hepatitis C. MitoQ mitochondria-targeted antioxidant rapidly permeate lipid bilayer accumulates within mitochondrion organ liver , brain , heart , skeletal muscle . There strong evidence increase oxidative stress mitochondrial damage lead apoptosis via caspase activation . Several study show MitoQ protect cell apoptosis act caspase inhibitor may effective reduce cell damage liver disease . It hypothesise administration MitoQ low raise ALT see patient chronic Hepatitis C compare placebo . Approximately 36 patient unresponsive suitable interferon-based therapy enrol one centre . Treatment duration 28 day 28 day post-treatment follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial MitoQ Raised Liver Enzymes Due Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C viral liver infection contribute significantly burden chronic liver disease . It currently estimate 170 million individual ( 3 % world 's population ) infect . In New Zealand , estimate 25,000 people live hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection prevalence predict increase 50 % next 10 year . HCV primarily spread blood-to-blood contact . The single important risk factor acquire HCV use inject recreational drug , account approximately 80 % infection . Unlike hepatitis B , hepatitis C vaccine currently available . In absence effective vaccine current treatment choice interferon ribavirin . However , treatment chronic HCV infection interferon-alpha monotherapy achieve sustain virologic response . Therefore , important develop alternative treatment strategy patient unresponsive intolerant current antiviral therapy . The aim protocol compare two dos mitochondrial antioxidant treatment ( MitoQ ) placebo treatment patient raise liver enzyme due HCV infection . Approximately 36 eligible patient chronic HCV infection randomise receive one two dos MitoQ placebo 1:1:1 ratio . Treatment duration 28 day 28 day post-treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
