	<brief_summary>This research study investigational product call Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) . The study design establish safety potential benefit MMF . MMF proven one effective medication date SLE associate nephritis . It also appear active polymyositis dermatomyositis . This medication inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase , rate-limiting enzyme synthesis guanosine nucleotide . It block type II isoform find activate lymphocyte potently type I isoform inhibit T- B-lymphocytes . In SSc , MMF try anti-thymocyte globulin one small open label study efficacy significant improvement skin score . We test safety efficacy MMF SSc . All study patient receive study medication . The effect study medication examine two subgroup patient : early progressive skin disease ( skin substudy ) muscle disease ( muscle substudy ) . The change modify Rodnan skin score ( MRSS ) creatinine phosphokinase ( CK ) , respectively , skin muscle substudies 6 month treatment compare baseline value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) autoimmune/connective tissue disease complex pathogenesis involve immune system dysregulation , lead fibrosis . Inflammatory autoimmune aspect disease overlap systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , disease show clearly respond MMF . Activated T-cells , probable target MMF SLE , likely also play important role SSc pathogenesis . Evidence include similarity SSc skin disease chronic graft versus host disease , disease T-cells play critical role . MMF proven one effective medication date SLE associate nephritis [ 1 ] . It also appear active polymyositis dermatomyositis , disease also show significant overlap SSc [ 2 ] . Myositis also feature SSc , suggest disease manifestation might particularly likely respond MMF . MMF inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase , rate-limiting enzyme synthesis guanosine nucleotide . It block type II isoform find activate lymphocyte potently type I isoform inhibit T- B-lymphocytes [ 3 ] . In SSc , mycophenolate try anti-thymocyte globulin one small open label study efficacy significant improvement skin score [ 4 ] . However , MMF try alone inSSc tried muscle disease associate SSc . In study , test safety efficacy MMF SSc . In study study patient receive medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must meet American College Rheumatology criterion systemic sclerosis diffuse cutaneous disease muscle involvement Patients must also meet one follow criterion : SKIN SUBSTUDY ( 20 patient ) Be within 1 1/2 year first nonRaynaud 's disease manifestation . How progression skin disease time past 6 month prior study entry base either documented increase skin score new area skin involvement progression ( 10 patient total recruit ) OR , MUSCLE SUBSTUDY ( 10 patient ) Have serum creatinine phosphokinase ( CK ) great 2 time upper limit normal Patients enter study basis elevate CK must also subjective and/or objective weakness ; clinical evidence cardiac , pulmonary gastrointestinal disease complication patientÂ¿s systemic sclerosis ; progressive skin disease . The total number patient enter criterion 2a 2b ( skin substudy ) 20 . Patients meet criterion 2c . either 2a 2b first recruit muscle substudy ( criterion 2c ) 10 patient recruit .
