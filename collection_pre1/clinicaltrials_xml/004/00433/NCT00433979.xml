	<brief_summary>Women represent increase proportion HIV case globally Canada , yet underrepresented clinic trial . It therefore critical conduct study antiretroviral ( ARV ) pharmacokinetics ( PK ) woman obtain additional information ARV drug level woman relation adverse event ( AEs ) . The hypothesis study three-fold : 1. mean drug level ( Cmin Cmax ) ARVs significantly high female population compare mean drug level historical HIV population ( primarily men ) 2. ARV drug level , particularly Cmin , associate body weight woman 3. high ARV drug level , particularly Cmax , associate high frequency severity AEs . The objective study follow : Primary objective : 1 . To demonstrate level Protease Inhibitors ( PIs ) Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) significantly high female population compare mean drug level historical general population ( primarily men ) . 2 . To determine association PI NNRTI minimum concentration ( Cmin ) body weight female population . Secondary objective 1 . To determine association maximum concentration ( Cmax ) frequency severity AEs measure proportion patient grade 2 high laboratory clinical AEs Symptom Index Score woman . 2 . To determine association ARV drug level age , race , height , body mass index , adherence , hormonal level therapy , menstruation history , duration HIV infection , duration ARV therapy , baseline viral load , baseline CD4 count , present CD4 count , hepatitis B C infection , class ARVs , presence ritonavir medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Predictors antiretroviral pharmacokinetics HIV-infected woman virologic suppression combination antiretroviral therapy Background Women Canada constitute fast grow population group risk infection HIV AIDS . Women represent approximately 40 % AIDS case worldwide approximately 20 % case Canada . Although AIDS epidemic ongoing 20 year , surprisingly little known differential efficacy toxicity various antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug woman compare men . This gap knowledge result initial exclusion continue underrepresentation woman ARV clinical trial . Many study suggest HIV-infected woman take ARV treatment ( ART ) adverse event ( AEs ) men , especially relationship systemic symptom like diarrhea , well organ toxicity , include hepatotoxicity , lactic acidosis , peripheral neuropathy , notably , lipodystrophy . Currently , occurrence management AEs important issue treatment HIV . Understanding reason difference AEs HIV-infected woman critical yet evaluate within large cohort . It unknown whether difference relate hormonal influence , drug metabolism , adherence , fat distribution , body size factor . Some small study find drug level ( e.g . Cmin , Cmax , AUC ) high woman associate increased toxicity . Ultimately , plan conduct randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) ass utility therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) ARV drug dose adjustment frequency AEs woman . Prior conduct RCT , critical conduct study ARV pharmacokinetics ( PK ) woman obtain additional information ARV drug level woman relation AEs . Hypothesis The hypothesis study three-fold : 1. mean drug level ( Cmin Cmax ) ARVs significantly high female population compare mean drug level historical HIV population ( primarily men ) 2. ARV drug level , particularly Cmin , associate body weight woman 3. high ARV drug level , particularly Cmax , associate high frequency severity AEs . Patient population Eighty HIV-infected woman 8 Canadian site first combination ART regimen contain either PI NNRTI ( since ARV agent eligible PK analysis ) least three month evidence full virologic suppression ( HIV RNA VL le 50 copies/mL ) least two occasion least one month apart . Objectives Primary objective 1 . To demonstrate Cmin Cmax PIs NNRTIs significantly high female population compare mean drug level historical general population ( primarily men ) . 2 . To determine association PI NNRTI Cmin body weight female population . Secondary objective 1 . To determine association Cmax frequency severity AEs measure proportion patient grade 2 high laboratory clinical AEs Symptom index score woman . 2 . To determine association ARV drug level age , race , height , body mass index , adherence , hormonal level therapy , menstruation history , duration HIV infection , duration ARV therapy , baseline VL , baseline CD4 count , present CD4 count , hepatitis B C infection , class ARVs , presence ritonavir medication . Study design The study cross-sectional study ARV drug level ( Cmin Cmax ) measure weekly three week Three sample take subject reduce variability due technologic biologic source . Data collect demographic characteristic , clinical disease ARV history clinical toxicity first visit . Blood work carry first visit ass laboratory toxicity hormonal level . Data analysis Drug level summarize mean 3 value Cmin Cmax woman PI NNRTI compare mean value general HIV population . Cmin Cmax classify high low level high level define less equal 1.5 X arithmetic population mean drug . Characteristics patient high drug level compare patient low drug level . Univariate multivariate logistic regression model use identify independent association patient characteristic high drug level . The proportion patient AEs median number AEs per patient compare patient high Cmax patient low Cmax .</detailed_description>
