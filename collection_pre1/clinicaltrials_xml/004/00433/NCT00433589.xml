	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Giving chemotherapy hormone therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether genetic test effective clinical assessment determine need chemotherapy treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study genetic test see well work compare clinical assessment determine need chemotherapy woman breast cancer either node-negative involves 3 lymph node .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Testing Clinical Assessment Determining Need Chemotherapy Women With Breast Cancer That Involves No More Than 3 Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare molecular profiling approach ( 70-gene signature ) v usual clinical assessment assign adequate risk category ( need receive adjuvant chemotherapy ) breast cancer patient 0-3 positive lymph node . - Compare efficacy long-term toxicity docetaxel capecitabine vs standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens patient . - Determine best endocrine treatment strategy ( i.e. , letrozole 7 year vs sequential tamoxifen 2 year follow letrozole 5 year ) patient . Secondary - Compare relative ( hazard ratio ) absolute ( percentage 5 year ) efficacy regimen , term disease-free survival ( DFS ) , distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , patient . - Determine overall estimate efficacy ( DFS , DMFS , OS ) treatment strategy accord clinical-pathological prognosis molecular prognosis patient . - Estimate percentage patient receive chemotherapy per prognostic method . - Identify predictive gene expression profile clinical response/resistance anthracycline-based docetaxel-capecitabine chemotherapy patient . - Compare novel gene expression signatures predict clinical response patient treat sequential tamoxifen-letrozole v letrozole alone . - Compare OS distribution patient treat regimen . - Compare early late toxicity regimens patient . - Evaluate adjuvant endocrine treatment success failure subgroup postmenopausal patient endocrine-responsive disease . - Compare safety profile two endocrine therapy regimens patient . OUTLINE : This partially randomize , open-label , prospective , multicenter study . Patients clinical high-risk ( CHR ) genomic high-risk ( GHR ) disease assign receive chemotherapy . Patients clinical low-risk ( CLR ) genomic low-risk ( GLR ) disease receive chemotherapy . Patients discordant risk 2 decision-making tool ( standard clinical-pathological criterion v 70-gene signature criterion ) randomize receive chemotherapy . Patients HER-2 positive tumor method discordant randomize chemotherapy , receive adjuvant trastuzumab alone adjuvant endocrine therapy ( hormonal receptor positive ) , decide treat physician . Patients HER-2 positive tumor classify low-risk method receive adjuvant trastuzumab alone adjuvant endocrine therapy ( hormonal receptor positive ) , decide treat physician issue trastuzumab reimbursement exist investigator 's country . - Chemotherapy : Patients stratify accord participate center , risk group ( GHR/CLR v GLR/CHR ) , hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] positive and/or progesterone receptor [ PR ] positive v ER PR negative ) , age ( &lt; 50 year vs least 50 year ) , HER2/neu status ( positive v negative v unknown ) , method axillary evaluation ( sentinel v dissection ) , type surgery ( mastectomy v quadrantectomy/tumorectomy ) . In case PR unknown , patient stratify hormone receptor ( HR ) negative group ER negative , HR positive group ER positive . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( anthracycline-based ) : Patients may receive 1 follow regimens* : - FEC 100 : Patients receive fluorouracil IV , epirubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course . - Canadian CEF : Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide day 1-14 ( IV day 1 8 ) epirubicin hydrochloride IV fluorouracil IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course . - CAF : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , fluorouracil IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course . - FAC : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 fluorouracil IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course . - E-CMF : Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV , methotrexate IV , fluorouracil IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course . NOTE : *Patients refuse randomization may treat another chemotherapy regimen still include study . - Arm II ( docetaxel capecitabine ) : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course . - Endocrine therapy* ( postmenopausal premenopausal** patient endocrine-responsive tumors*** ) : Patients stratify accord participate center , risk group ( GHR/CHR vs GHR/CLR v GLR/CHR v GLR/CLR ) , adjuvant chemotherapy ( vs nonrandomized v arm I vs arm II ) , endocrine sensitivity ( ER PR positive v either ER PR positive ) , age ( &lt; 50 year vs least 50 year ) , HER2/neu status ( positive v negative v unknown ) , method axillary evaluation ( sentinel v dissection ) , type surgery ( mastectomy v quadrantectomy/tumorectomy ) . In case PR unknown , patient stratify HR negative group ER negative , HR positive group ER positive . Therapy begin prior surgery patient receive chemotherapy chemotherapy . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate daily 2 year . Patients receive oral letrozole daily 5 year . - Arm II : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 7 year . NOTE : *The first dose endocrine therapy administer within 4 week follow randomization ( R-E ) date . If treatment start within 300 day definitive surgery , patient becomes ineligible randomized endocrine therapy . NOTE : **Premenopausal woman ( &lt; 50 year ) must undergo adequate ovarian suppression ( gonadotropin release hormone , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral ovarian radiation ) . NOTE : ***Patients endocrine-responsive tumor refuse randomization receive standard endocrine therapy may remain study . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually least 15 year . FINAL ACCRUAL : A total 6,694 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
