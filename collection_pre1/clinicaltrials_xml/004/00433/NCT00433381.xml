	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together irinotecan temozolomide work treat patient recurrent refractory glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together irinotecan temozolomide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride , term 6-month progression-free survival rate , patient recurrent refractory intracranial glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . II . Determine adverse event profile tolerability bevacizumab temozolomide patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy bevacizumab temozolomide , term 6-month progression-free survival rate , patient previously treat temozolomide . II . Determine efficacy bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride , term objective response , patient measurable disease . III . Determine efficacy bevacizumab temozolomide , term objective response , patient measurable disease previously treat temozolomide . IV . Determine toxicity profile tolerability bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess potential role perfusion MRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy image early indicator response therapy 2 week treatment bevacizumab . II . Assess potential role perfusion MRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy image prognostic indicator base image take baseline , 2 week , 2 course study treatment . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 50 v &gt; = 50 year age ) Karnofsky performance status ( 70-80 % vs 90-100 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm 2:1 ratio ( arm I : arm II ) . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral temozolomide daily day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV Arm I follow irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient undergo MRI baseline every 2 course ( 2-week MRI ) per standard care progression discontinuation treatment assess area breakdown blood-brain barrier . Patients undergo additional MRI study therapy . Consenting patient also undergo diffusion perfusion MRI magnetic resonance spectroscopic image correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow least 1 month .</detailed_description>
