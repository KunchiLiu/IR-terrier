	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel see well work without bevacizumab treat patient cancer spread lymph node ( lymph node-positive ) cancer spread lymph node high risk return ( high-risk , lymph node-negative breast cancer ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery help prevent tumor return . It yet know whether doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel effective without bevacizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine disease-free survival patient ( defined invasive disease-free survival [ IFDS ] ) lymph node positive high risk lymph node negative breast cancer randomize treatment either doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) /cyclophosphamide plus placebo follow paclitaxel ( AC + placebo &gt; T + placebo ) chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare short-term ( 20-24 week ) versus long-term ( 50-54 week ) bevacizumab therapy . II . To compare overall survival . III . To evaluate toxicity . IV . To evaluate association outcome E5103 ( disease-free survival , overall survival toxicity ) genotype ( derived candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms genome wide evaluation ) . V. To compare quality life breast cancer patient treat AC/paclitaxel bevacizumab placebo , term physical symptom , physical functioning , psychological state social function 18 month period . VI . To determine impact theoretical biomarker information patient ' willingness accept toxicity bevacizumab estimate potential benefit . VII . To create biospecimen repository include plasma , serum CellSearch cassettes contain circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) evaluate determinant late relapse , include candidate biomarkers reflect occult tumor burden ( e.g. , CTCs plasma tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] ) host factor ( e.g. , estrogen , insulin-insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] axis , inflammation , etc ) . VIII . To create biorepository metastatic tumor sample patient late relapse . IX . To determine body mass index ( BMI ) comorbidity burden patient operable breast cancer five year diagnosis . X . To determine whether relationship late relapse BMI diagnosis 5 year diagnosis , whether BMI-associated inflammatory and/or metabolic biomarkers associate early late recurrence . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , cyclophosphamide IV 20-30 minute , placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 3 week 4 course . Beginning 3 week later , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment paclitaxel placebo repeat every 3 week 4 course . ARM II : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 3 week 4 course . Beginning 3 week later , patient receive paclitaxel arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment paclitaxel bevacizumab repeat every 3 week 4 course . ARM III : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide arm I bevacizumab arm II . Treatment repeat every 2 3 week 4 course . Beginning 3 week later , patient receive paclitaxel arm I bevacizumab arm II . Treatment paclitaxel bevacizumab repeat every 3 week 4 course . Beginning 2 month later , patient receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab alone repeat every 3 week 10 course . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 15 year .</detailed_description>
