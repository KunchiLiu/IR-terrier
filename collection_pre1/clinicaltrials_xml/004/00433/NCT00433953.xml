	<brief_title>Genetic Drug Study Mycophenolic Acid ( CellCept ) Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , inpatient-outpatient prospective observational study determine whether inter-patient variability mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) pharmacokinetics exposure , adverse event clinical response pediatric transplant patient ( age 2-18 year ) associate identifiable pharmacogenetic factor . Specific aim : 1 . ) To determine whether common polymorphic variation uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) associate inter-individual variability MPA pharmacokinetics exposure ( affect MPA metabolism ) . 2 . ) To determine whether common polymorphic variation uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) associate inter-patient difference incidence adverse event ( affect formation acyl-glucuronide metabolite ) . Enrolled subject receive mycophenolate mofetil part clinical standard care . It anticipate clinical portion study last 4 hour one study visit include one pharmacogenetic blood sample 4 pharmacokinetic blood sample collect 3 hour post-dose . Safety data collect include standard care physical exam safety laboratory test well data adverse event clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
