	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease lysosomal storage disorder result deficiency key enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) . The enzyme deficiency cause genetic mutation , result production misfolded GCase . AT2101 design act pharmacological chaperone selectively bind misfolded GCase help fold correctly , may restore GCase activity . This study conduct test safety AT2101 patient type 1 Gaucher disease already receive enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) . The study involve six visit period 7 week evaluate safety AT2101 .</brief_summary>
