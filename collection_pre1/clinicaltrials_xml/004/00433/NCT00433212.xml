	<brief_summary>The machine oxygen use help premature baby breathe side-effects , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . Infants BPD get complication ( high death rate , long time intensive care assist ventilation , hospital readmission first year life , learn problem ) infant develop BPD . Doctors try remove tube wind-pipe link baby breathe machine soon possible . However , small baby get tire , still require help breathe . One standard common technique help breathe without tube wind-pipe use simple pressure support , nasal continuous positive airway pressure nCPAP . This support breathe little , often enough prevent need go back breathe machine . Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) similar nCPAP , also give breath , extra support , baby small tube nose . NIPPV safe effective , already use alternate `` standard '' therapy . The main research question : After wean breathe machine , NIPPV well nCPAP prevent BPD premature baby weigh 999 gram less birth ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immature lung extremely low birth weight ( ELBW , &lt; 1000 g ) infant easily damage placement endotracheal tube deliver mechanical ventilation oxygen . This total time mechanical ventilation contributes bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . Infants BPD increase risk later death neuro-impairment . With increase survival ELBW infant NICU , proportionate increase number infant survive BPD . Following invasive ventilation via endotracheal tube ( ETT ) , extubation nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( nCPAP ) ventilation standard approach . Currently , 40 % infant extubated give nCPAP support fail , require re-intubation . Previous work suggest less invasive respiratory support Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation ( NIPPV ) , without endotracheal tube less injurious lung . NIPPV may thereby reduce duration invasive ventilator support , aid successful early extubation . We hypothesize use NIPPV lead high rate survival without BPD standard therapy nCPAP . This randomized clinical trial appropriately power compare NIPPV nCPAP detect effect clinically relevant long-term outcome , death BPD 36 week . This multi-national , randomize , open clinical trial two different standard method provide non-invasive respiratory support 1000 extremely preterm infant weigh less 1000 gram birth .</detailed_description>
