	<detailed_description>Diabetes lead cause death Western World medical cost increase annually . There cure diabetes , blood glucose monitoring key component diabetes treatment management . Consistently high blood sugar level , time , lead complication blindness , kidney disease , heart disease , nerve damage.In addition , low blood sugar may lead immediate danger . Self-monitoring blood glucose level essential self-management diabetes become widespread past decade . Blood glucose determination currently do invasive method ( finger tip prick ) , follow measure blood drop characteristic . Currently , commercially available reliable non-invasive glucose measurement device market . The GlucoTrack , non-invasive device determine glucose level base simultaneous measurement three independent orthogonal parameter . The rationale development device improve patient 's quality life provide device easily use provide painless measurement method , thereby lead high compliance , good manage diabetes</detailed_description>
