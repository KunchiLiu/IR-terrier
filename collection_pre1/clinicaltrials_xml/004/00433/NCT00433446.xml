	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0354 , Anti-IL-6 Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess confirm prostate-specific antigen response patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treat anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody . Secondary - Assess overall survival progression-free survival patient . - Assess objective response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Assess qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
