	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood tissue patient basal cell nevus syndrome healthy participant laboratory may help doctor learn change may occur DNA identify biomarkers relate basal cell nevus syndrome . Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use sirolimus may keep basal cell skin cancer form patient basal cell nevus syndrome . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study topical sirolimus patient basal cell nevus syndrome healthy participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Sirolimus Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare messenger RNA protein expression pattern patient basal cell nevus syndrome ( BCNS ) v culture cell healthy participant ( control ) treatment identify set gene differentially express BCNS . - Assess effect topical sirolimus gene expression ( gene identify primary objective ) vivo use keratinocytes , fibroblast , lymphocytes patient BCNS healthy participant ( control ) target expression method . OUTLINE : Patients healthy participant receive topical sirolimus ointment twice daily 12 week . Blood skin biopsy obtain baseline week 12 gene protein expression study . Alterations RNA measure microarray analysis . Alterations protein expression measure 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry . After completion study therapy , patient healthy participant follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16 patient healthy participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
