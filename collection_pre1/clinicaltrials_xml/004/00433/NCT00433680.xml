Posters flyer campus also use recruitment tool . Participants assign either healthy weight management condition medium literacy condition ( participant learn trick medium use enhance woman 's appearance ) . In condition , participant attend four weekly 1-hour session lead female research assistant Oregon Research Institute . All participant complete 5 structured psychiatric interview assess current Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM-IV ) symptom anorexia nervosa , bulimia nervosa , binge eat disorder , well psychiatric condition commonly co-occur bulimia nervosa adolescence . Participants also complete 5 survey focus attitude , feeling , behavior past month .
