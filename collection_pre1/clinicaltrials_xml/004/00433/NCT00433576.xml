	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine relationship oral dose resveratrol colon mucosal level resveratrol metabolites patient resectable colorectal cancer . II . Determine relationship colon mucosal level resveratrol metabolites plasma concentration resveratrol metabolites patient . III . Determine cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) expression colorectal cancer tissue treatment patient . IV . Determine M_1G concentration colonic cancer tissue circulate white blood cell ( WBC ) treatment . V. Correlate M_1G concentration colorectal cancer tissue M_1G concentration circulate WBC . VI . Assess Ki67 label index normal malignant tissue least 10 field per section . VII . Correlate COX-2 expression colorectal cancer tissue COX-2 expression circulate WBCs . VIII . Assess toxicity profile drug . OUTLINE : This two-stage nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients assign 1 2 dose level stage 2 . STAGE I : Patients undergo colorectal endoscopy . Patients whose biopsy confirm colorectal adenocarcinoma histology require surgical resection continue study stage 2 . STAGE II : Patients receive oral resveratrol day 1-8 . Patients undergo colorectomy day 9 . A tumor biopsy perform endoscopy colorectomy research purpose . Two biomarkers potential activity resveratrol measure nonmalignant malignant colorectal tissue biopsy sample : level M_1G adduct immunoslot blot analysis level cyclooxygenase-2 protein/Ki67 immunohistochemistry . Blood sample collect baseline colorectomy analysis resveratrol metabolites pharmacokinetic study .</detailed_description>
