	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give rituximab together combination chemotherapy bortezomib work treat patient untreated mantle cell lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving rituximab together combination chemotherapy bortezomib may kill cancer cell . Treatment consist six agent : bortezomib ( Vc ) , rituximab ( R ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , vincristine ( V ) , doxorubicin ( A ) , dexamethasone ( D ) ( VcR-CVAD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate complete response ( CR ) rate patient mantle cell lymphoma , treat VcR-CVAD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate VcR-CVAD . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient receive maintenance rituximab VcR-CVAD induction . III . To evaluate PFS OS patient receive autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) VcR-CVAD induction . IV . To evaluate toxicity VcR-CVAD . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation antigen expression pattern determine confirm possible unique expression MCL . II . To evaluate percentage circulate mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) cell . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Induction therapy ( VcR-CVAD ) : Patients receive VcR-CVAD comprise bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV 3-5 second day 1 4 ; rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV 3-4 hour day 1 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride 25 mg/m2/d IV 48 hour day 1 2 ; cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV 3 hour every 12 hour day 1-3 ; vincristine 1 mg IV 3-5 second day 3 ; dexamethasone 40 mg IV orally daily day 1-4 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) IV daily begin day 5 6 continue blood count recover OR pegfilgrastim SC day 5 6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Maintenance therapy : Beginning 4-8 week completion induction therapy , patient receive rituximab IV 3-4 hour weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 month 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion induction therapy , patient eligible may option receive consolidation therapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) ( off-study ) . These patient undergo stem cell harvest course 4 , 5 , 6 induction therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
