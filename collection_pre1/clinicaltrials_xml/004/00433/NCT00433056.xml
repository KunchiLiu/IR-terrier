	<brief_title>Long Term Treatment Interruptions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale As current regimen eradicate HIV infection , person live HIV doom assume chronic therapy often demand daily schedule . In long run , may lead reduce adherence therapy , incomplete suppression viral replication emergence resistant virus vanish patient ' effort . Furthermore continue exposure antiretroviral drug , patient begin experience new adverse effect include body fat redistribution , dislipidemia , diabetes , insulin resistance , osteopenia fear unexpected complication cardiovascular disease raise . A variety strategy emerge try help long-term management HAART . Researchers focus attention development simpler regimen . An alternative approach involve various type structure treatment interruption ( STI ) . Several different role claim STIs . They postulate enhance specific immune response allow control viral replication , absence continuous HAART , seroconverters . In advanced treatment failure STIs suggest favor overgrowth wild-type virus peripheral circulation thus facilitate `` disappearance '' resistance mutation . In chronically infected patient without virologic failure STIs explore boost HIV specific immune response , recently , reduce drug exposure , promote adherence minimize drug-related morbidity . Various strategy fix interval period , specific threshold , either immunologic virologic , re-initiation therapy explore . To date , unanswered question STIs even pulse therapy include risk expose patient differential drug level may enhance selection resistant mutant , effect re-seeding viral reservoir , real extent assumption less drug associate less toxicity good adherence , overall outcome compare continuous HAART . Finally STIs pulse therapy may result strictly link question raise new treatment recommendation : individual begin therapy CD4 + cell level currently recommend threshold , manage patient , HAART , gain CD4 cell count far threshold . We conduct control , prospective randomize trial cohort chronically HIV infected individual effective HAART address open question . We apply individualized pulse therapy strategy , drive CD4 + cell count , compare conventional continuous HAART . Study objectives Primary objective study : To compare efficacy safety continue conventional HAART chronically infect HIV patient therapeutic strategy base long term , immunologically drive treatment interruption . Secondary objective : - To verify risk develop viral resistance - To verify effect two strategy metabolic parameter - To verify possibility steadily discontinue antiretroviral therapy patient start baseline immunological value higher currently recommend international guideline HIV treatment - To identify predictive variable possibility safely discontinue antiretroviral therapy - To verify dynamic CD4 + loss HIV replication treatment interruption As study want enroll patient strictly reflect population HIV infected individual , previous mono dual therapy well presence co-morbidities HBV HCV co-infection constitute exclusion criterion , record . Study design This multicenter , randomize , control , open , comparative study . The trial follow-up 5 year . Patients monitor accord international local guideline HIV infection far time type laboratory clinical control . Laboratory exam decide locally key test require study . The timing laboratory evaluation 1 2 month treatment interruption thereafter every 2 month STI arm every 4 month control group . All data store computerized data-base . Study arm management study Patients randomize ratio 1 : 2 one follow treatment arm : 1 . Continuing ongoing HAART ( control ) 2 . Long term treatment interruption ( STI ) Randomization accomplish centrally accord pre-determined , computer-generated random list . In control group , patient allow change therapy virological , toxicological personal reason . All variation record . Patients change therapy still include ITT analysis , consider failure AT analysis . Patients stop therapy , reason resume within 3 month consider failure ITT AT analysis In STI arm , patient stay therapy CD4 count drop &lt; 350 cells/mcL ( one measurement consider sufficient ) . At time point patient resume HAART regimen assume STI period continue HAART CD4 count raise &gt; 600 cells/mcL plasma HIV-RNA drop detection limit 50 copies/ml ( one measurement consider sufficient ) . When CD4 count viral load within pre-set value stop therapy . There limit number interruption re-start cycle study period 160 patient allocate STI arm 80 patient control arm . End point evaluation criteria The primary end-point evaluation main objective study clinical : The primary outcome measure base occurrence clinical end-point define : disease progression ( occurrence AIDS define event ) , death cause occurrence clinical event require hospital admission The secondary objective study evaluate basis : - Mean variation blood cholesterol triglycerides baseline value . Development lipodystrophy modification pre-existing lipodystrophy - Time therapy , variation CD4 count HIV-RNA level - Genotypic test perform case HIV-RNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml therapy least 4 month one month treatment interruption . Duration study Treatment continue 5 year study condition . Patients complete study period still respond therapy keep regimen . Statistical evaluation study perform yearly . A first interim analysis perform mean follow-up reach 3 year . Monitoring Laboratory test study period perform fasting state . The following test procedure require record electronic data base . It also advise perform regular basis haemogram , renal function test , blood glucose amylase . Other test could perform accord local need particular situation relate specific management single patient : Baseline ( patient ) 1 ) Informed consent treatment randomization 2 ) Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , total cholesterol HDL , triglycerides 3 ) CD4 count , CD8 count 4 ) Plasma HIV-RNA 5 ) Clinical evaluation , anamnestic demographic data : sex , age , risk factor HIV infection , CDC AIDS classification , time ART , time current HAART , previous antiretroviral drug , previous sub-optimal ARTs , current antiretroviral drug , presence grade lipodystrophy , time HIV-RNA detection , nadir CD4 , CD4 start antiretroviral therapy . 1. month STI ( STI group ) 1 ) CD4 count , CD8 count 2. month STI ( STI group ) 1 ) Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , cholesterol ( total HDL ) , triglycerides 2 ) CD4 count , CD8 count 3 ) Plasma HIV-RNA , Genotype 4 ) Clinical evaluation : disease progression , lipodystrophy assessment Every 2 month thereafter ( STI group ) every 4 month baseline ( control group ) 1 . Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , cholesterol ( total HDL ) , triglycerides 2 . CD4 count , CD8 count 3 . Plasma HIV-RNA 4 . Clinical evaluation : disease progression , lipodystrophy assessment Additional test Additional test request specific case : 1. second genotype 4 month initiation STI period perform patient show major mutation genotype perform 2 month STI start 2. genotype perform patient either STI control group show viral load 1000 copies/ml continuous treatment period ( drug ) &gt; 4 month . Statistical consideration The study power evaluate equivalence two strategy assumption , control arm , primary end-point would observe proportion subject &lt; 7 % proportion STI arm would exceed 10 % maximum allow 95 % CI 12 % . According model publish Controlled Clinical Trials 1982 ; 3 : 345-353,320 patient need alfa = 5 % 1-beta = 80 % . The primary analysis make accord intention-to-treat approach therefore correction eventual drop out need . In addition , secondary per-protocol analysis perform . Chi-square Fisher 's exact test use analyze categorical variable . Time treatment failure estimate use Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate ( present graphically ) . The log-rank test use ass difference survival curve arm , ANOVA test Student 's test use continuous variable unless variable normally distribute , case Kruskal-Wallis Mann-Whitney U test use . Logistic regression analysis ( forward stepwise model ) use evaluate relationship variables outcome . All test two-sided P value inferior 0.05 regard significant . The analysis data perform propose Study Center SPSS statistical software package Windows , version 13.0 . Drugs This spontaneous study . It propose drug dispense accord standard procedure . Data use Data use scientific porpoise . The analysis perform yearly result disclose major participate group discussion comment . The type timing publication data agree among participant study .
