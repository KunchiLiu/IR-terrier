	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group Phase 3 study Vytorin 10/10 ( ezetimibe 10 mg simvastatin 10 mg ) , Vytorin 10/20 ( ezetimibe 10 mg simvastatin 20 mg ) , Vytorin 10/40 ( ezetimibe 10 mg simvastatin 40 mg ) compare placebo administer daily 8 consecutive week subject primary hypercholesterolemia ( LDL-C &gt; 3.64 mmol/L [ 140 mg/dL ] ) . The efficacy daily Vytorin versus placebo reduce concentration LDL-C evaluate , efficacy daily Vytorin versus placebo respect change concentration total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL-C compare . The safety Vytorin versus placebo also assess .</brief_summary>
