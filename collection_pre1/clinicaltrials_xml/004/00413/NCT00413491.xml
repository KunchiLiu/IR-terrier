	<brief_title>National Screening Denmark With MR Versus Mammography Ultrasound Women With BRCA1 BRCA2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study type : Interventional Study design : Diagnostic , Prospective , Non Randomised , Blinded , Efficacy study Further study detail provide DBCG ( Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group ) : Primary outcome measure : Diagnostic outcome yearly screen MR versus combine mammography ultrasound breast measure accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value . Secondary outcome measure : Comparison diagnostic outcome MR versus combine mammography ultrasound , woman dense breast tissue compare woman fatty breast tissue . Comparison cancer find woman BRCA gene mutation compare cancer find background population respect morphology , size , histological type , axillary lymph node status grade . Study start : January 2007 . Expected completion 2010 . Women BRCA gene mutation likely others develop disease young age breast density high old age.The tumour often rapidly develop short presymptomatic phase . These factor know reduce effectiveness screen mammography mammography seem low sensitivity woman BRCA gene mutation . Other study show 50 % cancer appear interval cancer two mammography screen examination many positive axillary node time diagnosis . Around 610 woman test BRCA gene positive Denmark year 2006 . These woman offer yearly screen mammography combine ultrasound clinical examination . The trial test whether screen offer combine replace MR mammography .</detailed_description>
