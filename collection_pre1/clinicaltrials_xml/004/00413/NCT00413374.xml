	<brief_title>Once Daily Enoxaparin Outpatient Treatment Acute DVT and/or Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) `` bridge '' warfarin become standard care outpatient treatment acute deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) . LMWH also often prescribe `` bridge '' warfarin patient acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . In United States , FDA approve enoxaparin twice daily dose outpatient treatment acute DVT . The FDA also approve enoxaparin treatment DVT without PE , FDA approve enoxaparin treatment PE without DVT . The FDA also approve daily enoxaparin DVT PE treatment indication outpatient . Once daily dose enoxaparin outpatient DVT alone , DVT PE , PE without DVT halve number require injection , facilitate outpatient treatment , reduce health care cost . For example , visit nurse make one visit daily instead two visit daily patient unable self-inject patient lack family friend inject LMWH . Merli et al randomize 900 hospitalize venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) patient acute DVT PE one three treatment group : 1 ) continuous infusion unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) , 2 ) daily enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg , 3 ) twice daily enoxaparin 1mg/kg . All study patient inpatient . None outpatient . They receive twice daily enoxaparin UFH least five day `` bridge '' warfarin . Patients follow three month . Primary endpoint recurrent DVT PE . There significant difference recurrent DVT PE among 3 treatment group . There 12 recurrent VTE event UFH group , 13 daily enoxaparin group , 9 twice daily enoxaparin group . The frequency major hemorrhage differ among three treatment group . Major hemorrhage occur 6 290 patient ( 2.1 % ) UFH group , 5 298 patient ( 1.7 % ) daily enoxaparin group , 4 312 patient ( 1.3 % ) twice daily enoxaparin group . Merli et al show daily enoxaparin effective safe twice daily enoxaparin . But study do among hospitalized patient acute DVT PE . Treatment result hospitalize patient necessarily apply outpatient population . Therefore , FDA approve outpatient DVT PE treatment daily enoxaparin . The BWH Venous Thromboembolism Research Group outstanding track record investigator initiated trial . We recently complete 2 investigator initiate trial enoxaparin treatment PE . One trial publish Thrombosis Haemostasis accept publication Vascular Medicine . Clinically stable PE patient normal right ventricular size function assess echocardiogram chest CT scan low risk adverse clinical event . Either image test excellent acquire information need document normal RV size function . These clinically stable PE patient negative biomarkers ( troponin ) normal right ventricular function safely treat outpatient . Therefore , wish include trial clinically stable patient acute PE normal right ventricular size chest CT addition patient acute DVT . Chest CT 4 chamber view RVD/LVD measurement perform case radiologist experience technique confirm normal RV size PE patient . In investigator initiated trial , conduct feasibility study daily enoxaparin `` bridge '' warfarin outpatient treatment acute DVT PE . Subject selection : Physicians care DVT PE patient noninvasive vascular lab , Emergency Department , primary care office , inpatient care unit Brigham Women 's Hospital often summon Group consultation . Our Group circumstance describe protocol . If refer physician patient agrees , patient approach enrollment physician investigator research team . We study 40 patient symptomatic DVT PE confirm ultrasound chest compute tomography respectively treat daily enoxaparin bridge warfarin . In case-control series , match 2 historical control age gender every case . Controls receive twice daily enoxaparin `` bridge '' warfarin acute venous thromboembolism match retrospective study previously hospitalize patient . Additional characteristic match control group include : prior DVT PE , cancer , heart disease , pulmonary disease . All patient enrol study receive enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/day bridge warfarin , use least 4 outpatient dos enoxaparin overlap enoxaparin warfarin least 4 day . Study Procedures : Enrollment : Eligible patient confirm DVT and/or PE stable outpatient treatment approach enrollment . Following enrollment , patient start enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/day bridge warfarin . Patients receive overlap daily enoxaparin warfarin least 4 day . After enrollment , patient start warfarin 7.5 mg daily . Initial INR check day 3 start warfarin . Thereafter , INR check daily day 4 day 7 INR ≥ 2.0 2 consecutive day . Enoxaparin discontinue minimum 4 day 2 consecutive value ≥ 2.0 . Once enoxaparin discontinue patient continue oral warfarin alone . All INR test do hospital , include Brigham Women 's , lab closer patient 's home . Study investigator perform anticoagulation management discharge 30 day ; initial office follow-up visit day 7 13 final office visit day 27 33 . This include clinical assessment , blood test renal function international normalize ratio ( INR ) . Each study visit take 1 hour . Each blood test require 5 ml patient 's blood . At conclusion 30-day trial , responsibility anticoagulation , include decision duration , revert Primary Care Physician . Biostatistical Analysis : The sample size 40 patient serve assess feasibility safety daily enoxaparin therapy bridge warfarin outpatient treatment acute DVT and/or PE . A composite endpoint death , recurrent venous thromboembolism , major hemorrhage assess 30 day . Comparisons make intention-to-treat basis . Separate analysis also perform individual endpoint . The statistical analysis plan include specific exploratory subgroup analysis : DVT without PE , PE without DVT , combine DVT plus PE . The statistical analysis `` intention treat . '' In word , patient recruit , patient analyze regardless protocol violation regardless miss data . No patient exclude analysis protocol violation , miss data , reason . Chi-squared testing use statistical analysis . For cell 5 few patient , Fisher 's Exact Test use . Efficacy safety statistically evaluate composite endpoint . This composite endpoint include : Death , recurrent venous thromboembolism , major hemorrhage 30 day . Separate analysis also perform individual endpoint .</detailed_description>
