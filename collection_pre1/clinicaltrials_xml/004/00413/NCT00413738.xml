	<detailed_description>Central venous line ( CVLs ) commonly use patient hemato-oncological disease indication monitor hemodynamics administration blood product , chemotherapy , parenteral nutrition , infusion fluid . Complications catheterization include mechanical ( arterial puncture , pneumothorax ) , thrombotic infectious complications.Data National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system ( US ) January 1992 February 1998 show catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBI ) third frequent nosocomial infection account 14 % nosocomial infection . CRBIs prolong hospital stay 7 21 day account estimated increase hospital cost $ 3000-40 000 per patient.In addition , estimate 10-20 % attributable mortality owe nosocomial CRBI report . Besides aseptic measure insertion catheter maintenance , many different approach attempt decrease central venous catheter infection : heparin-coated catheter , well antimicrobial antiseptic impregnate CVLs . Heparin-coated catheter : Studies show catheter-related infection may due fibrin deposition associate catheter . Interventions design decrease fibrin deposition thrombus formation potential reduce catheter-related infection . Antiseptic-coated catheter : Catheter colonization essential prerequisite pathogenesis CRBI . Colonization result contamination catheter insertion subsequent care . There data suggest contamination often occur time insertion . Therefore , attempt prevent colonization focus elimination initial contamination aseptic technique retardation subsequent migration organism bloodstream . Recently , catheter impregnate chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine develop reduce risk catheter-related sepsis . Initial study human show impregnation could effectively reduce colonization short-term catheterisation , less conclusive showing benefit impregnation reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections.The efficacy antiseptic catheter varies different subgroup population .</detailed_description>
