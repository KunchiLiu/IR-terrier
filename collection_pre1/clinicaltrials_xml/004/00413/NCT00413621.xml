	<brief_summary>The study investigate possibility detect early sign Alzheimer 's disease use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If plaque , type damage , image MRI , procedure could use clinical trial may also help clinical diagnosis patient . Alzheimer 's disease , progressive disease , major cause functional disability institutionalization , affect 4.5 million people United States , number triple 2030 population age . Patients age 55 90 mild symptom Alzheimer 's disease good health may eligible study . Twenty patient recruit Johns Hopkins ' Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center . There also control group 20 people without disease . Healthy patient volunteer clinical MRI brain scan neurological examination Johns Hopkins Hospital 7T MRI scan . Also , patient Mini-Mental State Examination , standardized test evaluate memory , do Johns Hopkins within 4 week 7T MRI . This study use device situate NIH Bethesda campus operate high magnetic field strength 7 Tesla , , unit use measure strength strong magnet . The Food Drug Administration categorize MRI 8 Tesla significant health risk . MRI scan routinely do magnetic field strengths 4T . MRI image create use large magnet radio wave . During procedure , patient lie table move strong magnetic field . They ask lie still easily hear speak research staff . A respiratory belt place around chest , finger probe place finger , monitor breathe heart rate . For obtain good picture , special lightweight coil may place around patient 's head . The scan take 20 minute 2 hour , scan 45 90 minute . Due limit experience use 7T MRI investigational nature , patient ask complete questionnaire immediately study . They ask comfort level experience unusual sensation . Answers review patient experienced MRI investigator get detail unusual sensation report . If patient experience unusual sensation , follow phone within 24 hour . This study wi ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective propose pilot study investigate possibility detect early sign Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) use high field ( 7T ) MRI . If plaque image MRI , procedure could use measure efficacy clinical trial AD , replace invasive method positron emission tomography ( PET ) . This procedure might also helpful clinical diagnosis patient . Study Population : The target population group 20 Alzheimer 's patient mild cognitive impairment . As reference , age-matched control group ( n=20 ) recruit normal adult population . Design : Our work hypothesis high resolution MRI 7T allow detection amyloid plaque AD . To test hypothesis , subject AD control population undergo MRI 7T image brain structure high resolution . Brain cortical structure compare two group investigated abnormality . Outcome Measure : As outcome measure study , determine ( sub ) cortical plaque typical AD detectable high field MRI .</detailed_description>
