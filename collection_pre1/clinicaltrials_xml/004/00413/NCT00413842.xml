	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether apply electrical stimulation cerebellum ( posterior low part brain ) influence brain excitability hand movement performance . A new technique become available stimulate brain : transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , could improve ability learn . Researchers know whether apply tDCS cerebellum could also influence motor function , want examine change brain excitability , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Patients age 18 40 pregnant may eligible study . They come NIH medical history complete questionnaire memory attention . There five experiment , 5 hour , 1 5 week , patient perform task like pinch special device thumb index finger , reach target object computer screen . Patients receive mild electrical stimulation different part head day . Some experiment do without electrical current , patient know one without stimulation . There also short questionnaire attention , fatigue , mood , complete , , experiment . Patients connect electromyography ( EMG ) machine , measure electrical activity muscle . Electrodes tap skin one small hand muscle . TMS allow electrical pulse pass brain stimulate . TMS use begin experiment determine precise location scalp two target area : cerebellum motor cortex . TMS safe procedure . Discomfort , headache , nausea occur , symptom usually go away promptly . During motor learn tDCS , also safe procedure , patient sit comfortable chair , arm wrist arm keep still . Sponge electrodes apply chin , back head , neck , collarbone , lateral part head , eyebrow . A small electrical current pass electrode . Patients may feel itch tingle sensation electrode see slight light flash . tDCS apply 20 30 minute . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , may also involve , use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . Patients lie table cylinder may ask lie still 60 minute time . This study direct benefit participant . However , knowledge gain may help researcher identify way improve movement people brain injury , chronic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Non-invasive brain stimulation modulate motor function healthy volunteer stroke patient applied primary motor cortex ( M1 ) . M1 evident target therapeutic intervention give key role motor control learn . However , give wide variety motor dysfunction follow focal neurological injury stroke , desirable find whether alternative neuronal structure could also responsive non-invasive brain stimulation enhance motor recovery . The cerebellum attractive target therapeutic non-invasive brain stimulation since ( ) cerebellum play pivotal role motor learn reach movement synchronization task , ( ii ) deep cerebellar nucleus involve regulation M1 neuronal activity excitatory drive M1 , ( iii ) cerebellum may adaptively recruit brain injury . The purpose study find application non-invasive transcranial DC stimulation ( tDCS ) modulate motor cortical function . We hypothesize tDCS cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral ( Cerebellum IPSI ) target hand modulate corticomotor excitability motor function healthy volunteer . Study Population 40 healthy volunteer ( 18-40 year ) . Design This proof principle study determine tDCS apply cerebellum modulate focally motor excitability ( assessed TMS ) motor performance . The stimulation parameter study polarity ( anodal , cathodal sham tDCS ) intensity ( 1 mA 2 mA ) . The focality stimulation address apply tDCS neck M1 separate control session , monitor change cerebello-cortical excitability paired-pulse TMS . The outcome measure change motor cortical excitability measure TMS performance isometric pinch force task , reach task , motor sequence time task . Attention mood assess rule nonspecific arousal effect . Paired-pulse TMS use demonstrate modulation cerebello-cortical connection characterize change intra-cortical excitability .</detailed_description>
