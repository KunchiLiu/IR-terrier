	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Three-Dose Regimen Adenoviral HIV Vaccine ( MRKAd5 HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef ) HIV Uninfected South African Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HIV epidemic major global health challenge . The Joint United Nations Program HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) report 2004 , 3 million people worldwide died AIDS estimate 5 million people acquire HIV .

MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef , clade B-based adenovirus serotype 5 HIV-1 vaccine , show elicit T-cell mediate immune response . The vaccine appear safe generally well tolerate previous Phase 1 2 study HIV-uninfected people . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine HIV-uninfected participant South Africa , clade C predominant . The study address whether clade B-based vaccine design elicit T-cellular immunity demonstrate efficacy reduce acquisition infection , reduce HIV viral load person become infected non-clade B region . This study last 42 month HIV-uninfected participant ; become HIV infected , visit continue 18 month diagnosis . Participants randomly assign receive 3 dos either vaccine placebo . All participant receive injection study entry Months 1 6 . Participants ask complete post-vaccination symptom log 3 day follow vaccination monitor body temperature symptom know associated vaccine . At study visit , participant ask adverse event may experience . There least 14 study visit first 4 year study .

Participants become HIV infect need begin anti-HIV therapy discontinue study , encourage enroll study HVTN 802 . As September 17 , 2007 enrollment vaccination study suspend . Participants already enrol ask continue attend follow-up visit study . Participants diagnose HIV infection participation study eligible enroll substudy . The purpose substudy expand HIV test gather data behavioral risk factor HIV infection among participant original study . Participants substudy attend study visit , include physical examination , HIV risk reduction counseling , blood collection , behavioral risk questionnaire . Some participant may HIV test part visit ; participant attend second study visit 2 week later receive HIV test result . Upon completion substudy , researcher contact participant provide information substudy result .</detailed_description>
