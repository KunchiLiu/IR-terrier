	<brief_title>Does Erythropoietin Improve Outcome Very Preterm Infants ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Early administration human erythropoietin ( EPO ) preterm infant reduce perinatal injury brain ( retina ) , lung gut improve neurodevelopmental outcome 24 month correct age . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether cerebral outcome improve infant born 26 0/7 31 6/7 gestational week birth receive erythropoietin high dose first three day birth . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To determine whether early administration EPO alters incidence complication typically associate preterm birth , i.e . mortality , septicaemia , necrotising enterocolitis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( oxygen dependency 36 week postmenstrual age ) , retinopathy , intracranial haemorrhage , white matter disease ( periventricular leucomalacia ) , growth failure , cerebral palsy handicap 5 year . Biomarkers encephalopathy prematurity assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) term equivalent age . RATIONALE EPO show protective hypoxic-ischaemic inflammatory injury broad range tissue organs besides promote red cell formation . It show neuroprotective neurotrophic activity animal acute brain damage well adult stroke patient . Several mechanism explain activity recognize : EPO inhibit glutamate release brain , modulate intracellular calcium metabolism , induces generation anti-apoptotic factor , reduces inflammation , decrease nitric oxide-mediated injury , direct antioxidant effect . Very preterm infant significant delay mental physical development assess 24 month correct age . The critical period first day preterm birth oxygenation brain may impair respiratory , circulatory nutritional insufficiency . Although probably several mechanism involve permanent brain damage , likely EPO multiple action may reduce damage . EPO study several trial preterm infant prevent anaemia widely use indication . STUDY DESIGN Randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial . Research plan 420 infant randomize first three hour life receive EPO ( 3000 U/kg body weight ) placebo intravenously 3 , 12-18 36-42 hour birth . Standardized evaluation include cerebral sonography day 1 7 36 0/7 gestational week ( discharge home discharged ) determine presence absence complication . Cerebral volume white matter volume assess 40 postmenstrual week MRI ( available ) . Experienced examiner assess developmental function 24 month correct age use reliable validly revise Bayley Scales II Infant Development determine presence absence impairment motor function ( cerebral palsy ) neurosensory function ( blindness deafness ) . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE At least 1 every 100 live bear infant born preterm . 90 % infant survive &gt; 50 % delay mental physical development assess 24 month correct age . More subtle problem affect cognition , vision hearing common age five year impact school performance quality life infant family . The aim trial examine whether short , easily applicable well tolerated pharmacological intervention improve neurodevelopmental outcome .</detailed_description>
