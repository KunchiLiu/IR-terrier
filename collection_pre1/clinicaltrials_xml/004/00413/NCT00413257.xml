	<detailed_description>Introduction : Postoperative pain consequence surgical lesion , also relate sensitization process appear peripheral central nerve . This sensitization induce clinically hyperalgesia allodynia . From experimental viewpoint come mainly central activation NMDA receptor neuron conduct nociceptive message . Recent study show high-dose opioids able , via NMDA receptor , enhance postoperative hyperalgesia increase pain score morphine consumption surgery . Nevertheless per operative use opioid still necessary avoid per operative stress systemic consequence surgical stimulation . Some drug ( ketamine , nitrous oxideâ€¦ ) succeed reduce postoperative hyperalgesia pain score acute morphine tolerance . They also able decrease pain chronicization . Nefopam , well know analgesic since 80 's , present analgesic anti hyperalgesic property lately demonstrate experimental trial . Nevertheless anti hyperalgesic property never evaluate human schedule cardiac surgery . Nefopam administration could reduce acute morphine tolerance could enhance postoperative pain management reduce sensitization process hyperalgesia . Objective : The main purpose clinical trial evaluate patient schedule cardiac surgery sternotomy nefopam effect nociceptive threshold evaluate dynamic Von Frey mechanical stimulation . The secondary objective evaluate static hyperalgesia , postoperative pain score , morphine consumption , cognitive function , development chronic pain dysesthesia . Methods : Prospective , randomize , double-blind study compare three parallel group receive per operative anesthesia except nefopam dos . Group 1 : nefopam infusion start surgical incision , induction time anesthesia continue postoperative H48 . Group 2 : nefopam administration start end surgery continue postoperative H48 . Group 3 : control group receive placebo induction time anesthesia H48 . All patient receive postoperatively morphine infusion follow Patient Controlled Analgesia concept . Number patient include : 90 Duration study : 2 year Start : second semester 2006 Expected result : Reduction extend hyperalgesia around wound evaluate dynamic Von Frey mechanical stimulation 20 % .</detailed_description>
