	<criteria>Male female , race , least 21 year old time preoperative exam , sign informed consent . The low age limit 21 year intend ensure documentation refractive stability . At least 6 month original LASIK surgery . Stable refraction 0.75D spherical equivalent desire correction le 1.50D cylinder manifest refraction . Both eye must within 1.00D spherical equivalent manifest refraction test . The eye treat wavefrontguided enhancement must least 9.5mm flap . Manifest refraction LADARWaveâ„¢ refraction must within 1.00D . At least 3 line potential improvement UCVA . BSCVA 20/20 better . Good corneal flap interface . Adequate corneal thickness surgery ( residual stromal bed &gt; 280 micron ) . Able willing give inform consent . Located great Washington DC area 12month period . Access transportation meet followup requirement . Female subject pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant study . Pregnancy rule urine pregnancy test . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin , amiodarone hydrochloride and/ sumatripin , determine history . Medical condition ( ) , , judgement investigator , may impair heal , include limited : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex ( As determine history ) . Active ophthalmic disease , neovascularization cornea within 1mm intended ablation zone , clinically significant lens opacity . Evidence glaucoma intraocular pressure great 22mm Hg baseline . Evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . Flap irregularity ( stria , interface debris , scar , epithelium ) . Calculated residual stroma bed less 280 . Stable refraction le 0.75D spherical equivalent desire correction 1.5D cylinder manifest refraction .</criteria>
