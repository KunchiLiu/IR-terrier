	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct prospective assessment small target contrast sensitivity disability glare refractive surgery . Study subject undergo treatment choice ( PRK LASIK ) evaluate treatment . Evaluations include best correct visual acuity , uncorrected visual acuity , psychometric questionnaire , pupil size , biomicroscopic examination , manifest refraction , wavefront measurement , low contrast acuity , contrast sensitivity normal low luminance without disability glare .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent . Normal , healthy active adult access medical care Walter Reed Health Care System . Age 21 year old . Spherical equivalent manifest refractive error 1.0 6.0 diopter ( D ) , inclusive , 3.0D cylinder . The absolute value cylinder ( express minus cylinder ) limit short axis elliptical ablation small 4.9mm . The following specifies maximum cylinder give spherical component manifest refraction : Spherical component / Maximum cylinder 1.0D / 0.5D 2.0D / 1.0D 3.0D / 1.5D 4.0D / 2.0D 5.0D / 2.5D 6.0D / 3.0D Corrected vision least 20/20 Soft contact lens user must havE remove lens least two week prior baseline measurement . Hard contact lens user ( PMMA rigid gas permeable lens ) must remove lens least four week prior baseline measurement . At least two weekly manifest refraction keratometry measurement require interval . The last two measurement must vary 0.50D meridian . Patients undergo orthokeratology must lenses remove least 6 month prior baseline examination . At least two monthly manifest refraction keratometry measurement take third month lens must vary 0.50D meridian . Refractive stability must document previous refraction . Spherical cylindrical portion manifest refraction must vary 0.50D previous 12 month . Exhibits strong motivation keep followup visit . Available evaluation Walter Reed twoyear followup period . Service member must command approval participate study . Access transportation meet followup requirement . Residual , recurrent active ocular disease corneal abnormality either eye iritis , uveitis , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , herpetic keratitis , vernal conjunctivitis , lagophthalmos , corneal scarring , glaucoma , previous steroid responder , occludable chamber angle , visually significant cataract . Either one eye suffer chronic dryness . Taking systemic medication may affect wound heal corticosteroid antimetabolite . Patient corneal neovascularization within one mm ablation zone . History previous eye surgery , include previous refractive surgery . Best correct visual acuity less 20/20 . Progressive myopia keratoconus . Any systemic disease may affect wound healing , connective tissue disorder ( rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , etc . ) , diabetes , severe atopic disease . Any physical mental impairment would preclude participation examination . For contact lens user must evidence contact lens corneal warpage computerize topography . Currently flight status project flight status within ten year . Pregnant breastfeeding infant . Women childbearing age must take urine blood pregnancy test starting study</criteria>
