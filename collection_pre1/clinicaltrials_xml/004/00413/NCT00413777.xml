	<brief_title>Tolvaptan Open-Label Pilot Efficacy , Tolerability Safety Study ADPKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease genetic disease classify formation fluid-filled cyst kidney . The accumulation cysts cause kidney enlarge several time normal size lead eventual loss renal function ultimately result renal failure end-stage patient . This disease life-threatening implication family member may also affect . Aside early antihypertensive control dietary protein restriction , presume offer modest degree protection , survive patient require renal replacement therapy ( dialysis transplant ) suffer high morbidity mortality . A rationale use tolvaptan genetic disorder proven , principle , use variety animal model . In model , tolvaptan effective halt reverse progression renal disease . The current study undertaken order evaluate whether tolvaptan , oral AVP inhibitor , maintain adequate safety profile show potential clinical benefit reduce total renal volume hop make impact upon disease progression .</detailed_description>
