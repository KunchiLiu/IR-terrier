	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) ATRA possibly idarubicin effective treat patient newly-diagnosed APL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>All-trans Retinoic Acid , Arsenic +/- Gemtuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) ATO design cause APL cell mature function normally . Idarubicin design cause break strand DNA ( genetic material cell ) . If find eligible take part study , begin induction . During induction , receive ATRA , mouth start Day 1 . You also receive ATO needle vein 2 hour start Day 1 . You continue receive drug every day bone marrow longer show APL cell . If high white blood cell count screening , receive idarubicin needle vein 30 minute one dose day Day 1 5 . During induction , blood ( 1-3 tablespoon ) draw every day Week 1 , 2 time week . This blood drawn routine test . During induction ( 21-28 day begin treatment ) , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . This may perform often doctor think need . If achieve complete remission induction phase , continue maintenance phase . During maintenance phase , receive ATO vein 2 hour Monday-Friday 4 week . After 4 week receive study drug , 4-week period `` '' ( study drug give ) . ATRA give mouth every day 2 week . This 2 week follow 2 additional week study drug give . You continue take ATRA treatment ATO complete . During maintenance , blood ( 1-3 tablespoon ) draw every 4-week cycle ATO , every week routine test . You also ECG every 4 week cycle take ATO . If achieve complete remission induction take study . If point study white blood cell count rise 10,000 , receive idarubicin vein 30 minute . You remain hospital first 7 day induction . After , must remain Houston next 3-4 week . Once maintenance phase , may treat home , must return M. D. Anderson study visit . After maintenance complete , follow-up visit additional 2 year . If time active study follow-up disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study . If low high white blood cell count join study , follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year . At visit , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test bone marrow aspirate . This investigational study . Idarubicin , ATRA ATO FDA approve commercially available . However , use study combination consider investigational . Its use APL patient investigational . Up 80 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
