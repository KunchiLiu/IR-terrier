	<detailed_description>Azacytidine design block certain gene cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting gene . By block `` bad '' gene , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You blood draw ( 3 teaspoon ) check kidney liver function ( routine blood test ) . You may bone marrow aspiration perform ( one recent week ) . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle .
