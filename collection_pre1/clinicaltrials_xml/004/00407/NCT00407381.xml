	<brief_summary>This study do see investigational drug Ranibizumab ( RBZ ) give injection eye , safe effective use people diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . The investigator want compare RBZ laser treatment current standard way treat DME . RBZ block growth factor think involve formation abnormal blood vessel cause loss vision patient DME .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Ranibizumab Edema mAcula Diabetes-2 ( READ-2 ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The READ-2 Study phase 2 randomize , multi-center clinical trial conduct investigator-initiated investigational new drug ( IND ) . The study aim enroll 126 patient , randomize 3 different group . The primary objective READ-2 Study : ( ) obtain data bioactivity dose interval effect intravitreal ranibizumab ( RBZ ) alone , well combination laser photocoagulation , retinal thickness visual acuity subject DME ; ( b ) obtain additional safety bioactivity data aid design phase 3 clinical trial evaluate ranibizumab therapeutic option patient DME The study consist 2-week screening period ( Days -14 0 ) , 6-month treatment period primary time endpoint , 18-month follow-up treatment period secondary time endpoint . Consented subject enter 14-day screening period determine eligibility . Serum chemistry hematology test , urinalysis , pregnancy testing , macular thickness measurement base optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) perform . Screening also include VA , ophthalmic examination fluorescein angiography ( FA ) entry criterion . Patients ETDRS visual acuity 20/40 worse , good equal 20/320 due foveal thicken macular edema secondary diabetes ( type 1 2 ) meet eligibility criterion eligible enroll study . Baseline foveal thickness OCT must least 250 , often associate VA 20/40 bad provide sufficient thicken treatment effect easily detectable ( Nguyen et al . 2004 ) . Approximately 126 patient DME enrol study clinical site study . Every effort make recruit enroll eligible patient men woman ethnic social background . Patients meet entry criterion able enroll study quota patient achieve .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis must confirm OCT image Foveal thickness great 250 , assess OCT Best correct visual acuity score study eye 20/40 20/320 inclusive ( Snellen equivalent use ETDRS protocol distance 4 meter ) . Only one eye treat study . If eye eligible , investigator select eye enrol . Visual acuity nonstudy eye must great 20/800 . In opinion investigator , decrease vision study eye due foveal thicken DME obvious cause . In opinion investigator , laser photocoagulation withhold least 30 day patient enrol study Panretinal photocoagulation macular photocoagulation within 3 month study entry study eye Use intraocular periocular injection steroid study eye ( e.g. , triamcinolone ) within 3 month study entry Previous participation study receipt antiangiogenic drug ( pegaptanib sodium , ranibizumab , anecortave acetate , protein kinase C inhibitor , etc . ) within 2 month study entry Eyes investigator feel appropriate additional laser photocoagulation Proliferative diabetic retinopathy study eye , exception inactive , fibrotic proliferative diabetic retinopathy regress follow panretinal laser photocoagulation tuft neovascularization elsewhere ( NVE ) less one disc area vitreous hemorrhage Vitreomacular traction epiretinal membrane study eye evident biomicroscopically OCT Structural damage center macula study eye likely preclude improvement visual acuity follow resolution macular edema , include atrophy retinal pigment epithelium , subretinal fibrosis , laser scar ( ) , macular ischemia , organize hard exudate plaque Ocular disorder study eye may confound interpretation study result , include retinal vascular occlusion , retinal detachment , macular hole , choroidal neovascularization cause ( e.g. , age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) , ocular histoplasmosis , pathologic myopia ) Concurrent disease study eye could compromise visual acuity require medical surgical intervention first 6month study period Eyes likely need cataract surgery intraocular lens implantation within first 6 month study Cataract surgery study eye within 3 month study entry ; YttriumAluminumGarnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy within 2 month study entry ; intraocular surgery within 3 month precede Day 0 .
