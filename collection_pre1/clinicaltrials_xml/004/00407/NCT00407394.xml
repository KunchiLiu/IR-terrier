	<detailed_description>Background : The World Health Organizations acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) management algorithms depend primarily two key clinical sign : elevate respiratory rate chest indrawing . The current Integrated management childhood infection ( IMCI ) algorithm prescribes child wheeze fast breathe present first level health facility give antibiotic continue fast breathe two dos bronchodilator . The primary purpose algorithm prevent mortality due bacterial pneumonia . However , unknown proportion child manage fashion viral relate wheeze illness asthma rather pneumonia . Although unlikely wheeze syndrome significant cause mortality child develop country , algorithms likely result unnecessary administration antibiotic well inadequate treatment recurrent wheeze illness . In developed develop country respiratory syncytial virus predominant etiological agent responsible bronchiolitis wheeze illness first two year life . Moreover data several study demonstrate respiratory syncitial virus ( RSV ) infection bronchiolitis syndrome major component total ALRI child live develop country . The relevant literature therapy include study child label bronchiolitis others child classify wheeze illness.We clear evidence whether antibiotic withheld category child wheeze . It clear wheeze occur bacterial infection addition co-infection virus bacteria well demonstrate several study pneumonia etiology child . Although study find child severe disease blood culture positive likely febrile presentation , sign sufficiently sensitive specific determine whether antibiotic administered.There extensive debate whether infant young child first year life respond bronchodilator therapy . Proposed reason lack response include : immaturity bronchiolar smooth muscle , increase dynamic airway closure relatively large degree mucosal edema . A literature search 1980 2000 reveals five randomize placebo control trial beta agonist administer acutely wheeze infant clinical outcome determine . Overall study support hypothesis child age less 12 18 month less responsive bronchodilator therapy old child . However , also demonstrate use inhale short act bronchodilator acute treatment wheeze offer benefit clinical outcome even young age group . The benefit beta agonist may restrict child recurrent wheeze provide small clinical benefitSetting : The study conduct eight medical college situate New Delhi , Chandigarh , Lucknow , Mumbai , Nagpur , Chennai , Vellore Trivandrum . Design : This multicentric , randomize , double blind efficacy trial . Block randomization do Dept . Pharmacology , KGMU , Lucknow , coordinate center trial . Blocks generate mixed batch . The medicine place pharmacy accord intervention type determine pharmacy . Two hundred twenty five random number generate block vary lengths nine sites.OutcomesPrimary : Clinical Cure : Respiratory rate agerate age specific cut-off ( &lt; 50 bpm infant &lt; 1 year &lt; 40 bpm age 12 – 59 month ) absence auscultatory well audible wheeze.Secondary : Response nebulization : Respiratory rate age specific cut-off ( &lt; 50 bpm infant &lt; 1 year &lt; 40 bpm age 12 – 59 month ) maximum three dos nebuliaztion salbutamol , auscultaroy wheeze may may present . But audible wheeze.Clinical failure therapy : Any sign severe pneumonia severe disease ; chest drawing , convulsion , drowsiness inability drink time ; Respiratory rate age specific cut-off day 4 ( without wheeze ) ; Oxygen saturation pulse oximetry &lt; 90 % day 4 ; Documented axillary temperature &gt; 101 degree Fahrenheit . In addition , child die within follow-up period 14 day lose follow-up day 4 also consider failed.Clinical relapse day 7- 15 : Signs severe pneumonia severe disease among case clinically cure day 4 follow-up.Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis use oral amoxycillin three day would effective , term clinical cure day 4 compare use oral placebo . Intervention : Amoxycillin tablet ( 125 mg ) placebo They use dissolve 5 ml clean water . The medicine give accord weight child follow : q 4 – 6 KG ½ tablet thrice dayq 7 - 10 KG 1 tablet thrice dayq 11 – 15 KG 1 ½ tablet thrice dayq 16 – 20 KG 2 tablet thrice dayMain objective : To compare proportion child age 2 59 month present non-severe pneumonia wheeze whose respiratory rate fall age specific cut-off three dos nebulized salbutamol , achieve clinical cure day 4 3 day treatment oral amoxycillin versus placeboSecondary objective : Among case non-severe pneumonia wheeze1 . To assess proportion child age 2 59 month present non-severe pneumonia wheeze audible wheeze2 . To assess proportion child age 2 59 month present non-severe pneumonia wheeze respond three dose nebulization salbutamol.Among case non-severe pneumonia wheeze age 2 59 month respond three dos salbutamol3 . To assess proportion fail therapy day 4 initial successful bronchodilator therapy inhale salbutamol.4 . To assess proportion relapse day 11- 14 initial successful bronchodilator therapy inhale salbutamol.5.To compare cost treatment clinical failure relapse among treated oral salbutamol.6 .To ass association bronchodilator response age , season , number previous wheeze episode , audible versus auscultatory wheeze family history asthma.7.To ass association relapse child show improvement treat inhaled salbutamol , age , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) isolation , season , number previous wheeze episode , audible versus auscultatory wheeze family history asthma.Among case non-severe pneumonia wheeze age 2 59 month respond three dos salbutamol8.To compare proportion child judge clinically cure 3 day treatment relapse within next 11-14 day observation 3-day treatment oral amoxycillin versus placebo.9.To compare cost treatment clinical failure relapse among treated oral amoxycillin placebo.10 . To assess association clinical failure day 4 age , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) isolation , season , number previous wheeze episode , audible versus auscultatory wheeze , family history asthma randomization amoxycillin therapy.Inclusion criterion : Children age 2-59 month non-severe pneumonia base WHO criteria respiratory rate age specific cut-off , audible / ausculatory wheeze , accessible follow , whose guardian give write informed consent.Exclusion criterion : Children severe disease , receive documented antibiotic treatment past 48 hour , diagnose asthmatic maintenance therapy , complicate acute non-pulmonary chronic illness , know drug allergy , hospitalization past 2 week , measles history measles within last month , know immunodeficiency disorder , prior enrollment study , reside area accessible follow-up whose guardian refuse consent study . Radiological Pneumonia X-Ray.Sample size : Two mode therapy assume equal failure rate new regimen 17 % . So site required recruit follow 225 case arm 18 month . Thus 950 child arm.Policy relevance : The present study plan evaluate role antibiotic child non-severe pneumonia present wheeze . It define patient disease characteristic associate clinical failure need antibiotic . The result study formulate policy use antibiotic child non-severe pneumonia wheeze .</detailed_description>
