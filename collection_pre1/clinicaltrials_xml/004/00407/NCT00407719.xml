	<brief_summary>The purpose study see drug bevacizumab safe effective use people choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . CNV eye condition abnormal blood vessel grow part eye responsible central ( straight ahead ) vision . The drug produce use recombinant DNA technology approve FDA use colon cancer . Although yet approve people CNV , FDA give permission use drug study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevicizumab ( Avastin ) Infusion Choroidal Neovascularization ( CNV ) Not Associated With Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody VEGF . It approve FDA treatment metastatic colon cancer 18 . We hypothesize VEGF also play role development CNV pathologic myopia . Therefore , employ mode therapy would decrease risk posed eye attenuate sclera , treat , special approval Pharmacy Therapeutic Committee Johns Hopkins University School Medicine , two patient persistent myopic CNV intravenous bevacizumab 19 . Despite multiple treatment PDT , CNV remain active vision continue decline two index patient . After four infusion bevacizumab , CNV become inactive . Six month last infusion patient , CNV show evidence activity leakage fluorescein angiography . Vision also improve diseased eye patient . The two patient tolerate infusion well , adverse event detect . In particular , blood pressure remain stable proteinuria note serial analysis 24-hour urine collection . The Bascom Palmer Eye Institute University Miami also recently report favorable outcome bevacizumab administer repeated dos 14 patient ( age &gt; 65 year ) CNV secondary AMD refractory therapy . We propose non-randomized , open-label pilot study evaluate effect bevacizumab patient CNV due cause AMD . This design allow u closely monitor safety tolerability bevacizumab evaluate 3 bioactivity outcome . Based upon dramatic response two patient CNV due myopic degeneration , hypothesize treatment bevacizumab may major advantage current standard care .</detailed_description>
