	<brief_title>Urokinase Plasminogen Activator System Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Histological inflammation patient Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) appear predict clinical progression ultimate long-term response various medical therapy , include finasteride . Discovery urine serum marker prostate inflammation invaluable clinical tool predict man 's risk BPH progression efficacy various medical therapy reduce risk . Specific Aim : We plan determine urokinase plasminogen activator ( and/or inflammatory marker ) serum , urine tissue patient predict prostatic inflammation Background : Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) Inflammation BPH common disorder prostate cause significant low urinary tract symptom negatively affect quality life substantial proportion men North America . According National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , BPH affect 50 % men age 60 many 90 % men age 70 . Although numerous genetic epigenetic change associate progression normal prostatic glandular formation BPH , early 1994 group suggest presence prostatic inflammation could associate pathogenesis progression histological clinical BPH . We demonstrate histological prostate inflammation common patient BPH well patient symptomatic symptomatic . Our local research group spearhead international consensus classification system prostatic inflammation subsequently employ ongoing study 8,000 men undergo 3 serial biopsy 4 year period time . The MTOPS BPH study data base subanalyses 1,000 men underwent baseline biopsy strongly suggest prostatic inflammation appear strong robust predictor symptomatic progression well response drug therapy . An analyse T-cell phenotype , cytokine expression pattern cellular cross talk BPH tissue 101 BPH patient prostatic cell culture show chronic inflammation trigger histological clinical progression . The search urine serum biomarkers prostatic inflammation highly relevant good target therapy men common condition . Urokinase Plasminogen Activator System Proteolytic enzymes require mediate inflammatory cell infiltration tissue , process highly regulate cell surface-specific receptor ( uPAR ) bind partner urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) . Numerous previous clinical investigation indicate serum level plasminogen activation system effective marker inflammation several disease process include CNS inflammation , asthma , metabolic syndrome pre-eclampsia . Very little data available regard plasma level soluble uPAR benign prostatic disease , although one previous report suggest high average level soluble uPAR patient low urinary tract symptom . Theses author report wide variation uPAR BPH patient greatly elevate level others undetectable level . However , author 's pathological confirmation finding could quantify level inflammation prostatic tissue . We hypothesize absolute relative serum level urokinase plasminogen activator system , include uPA , uPAR PAI-1,2 ( inhibitor uPAR/uPA complex ) , associate inflammation prostatic tissue .</detailed_description>
