	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose trial compare two different treatment option patient low risk low-tier intermediate risk prostate cancer . The two treatment arm compare study : ( control arm ) permanent interstitial prostate brachytherapy ( PIPB ) VERSUS ( experimental arm ) intensity modulate external beam radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . Hypothesis : The acute late toxicity experience patient experimental arm ( IMRT ) significantly bad toxicity experience patient control arm ( PIPB ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity Modulated Versus Interstitial - Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification : Patients low risk low-tier intermediate risk prostate cancer number different standard treatment option choose include radical prostatectomy , conventional external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) , permanent interstitial prostate brachytherapy ( PIPB ) . Each treatment option good outcome , although know small risk complication associate . Unfortunately , treatment option never directly compare therefore difficult determine treatment option compare respect overall outcome toxicity . A recent analysis BC Cancer Agency suggest patient treated conventional EBRT within Agency inferior outcome compare PIPB . This data , well indirect evidence , suggest conventional EBRT may suboptimal treatment option compare PIPB . Intensity modulate external beam radiotherapy ( IMRT ) new technology allow delivery high dos radiation tightly conforms target limit dose surround critical structure . Although IMRT currently standard therapeutic option utilized cancer sit BC Cancer Agency , utilized prostate cancer yet . Recent evidence confirm experimental therapy able allow safe escalation dose prostate cancer patient , may lead improved outcome , without increase toxicity . There current evidence side effect complication risk associate IMRT associate serious risk increase toxicity , although continue study . This study compare new therapeutic approach ( IMRT ) directly standard treatment option prostate cancer patient ( PIPB ) . This trial allow u determine toxicity treatment compare , successful , potentially lead large study analyse outcomes therapeutic intervention compare . We hope trial make important contribution care future management patient prostate cancer . Objectives : Primary Objective : The primary end point study acute late toxicity therapeutic intervention . Secondary Objectives : This trial also intend determine : - The willingness eligible patient randomize treatment intervention . - Obstacles accrual need address . - Testing ability meet accrual target . - Checking quality assurance benchmark IMRT PIPB procedure . - Discovering relieve bottleneck IMRT planning procedure . - Quality life . - Pathological local control . - Biochemical relapse-free survival . - Metastasis-free survival . - Overall survival . Research Method : The patient randomly assign equal probability one two treatment arm : Arm 1 ( Control Arm ) - Permanent interstitial prostate brachytherapy ( PIPB ) . Arm 2 ( Experimental Arm ) - Intensity modulate external beam radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . Statistical Analysis : Primary Endpoints : Acute GI grade 3 high toxicity . Acute GU grade 3 high toxicity . Late GI grade 3 high toxicity . Late GU grade 3 high toxicity . Secondary Endpoints : All acute late toxicity . Quality life score ( Using expand prostate cancer index composite - EPIC ) . Pathological local control . Biochemical relapse-free survival ( use Phoenix definition ) . Metastasis-free survival . Overall survival . Planned sample size : 50 patient total ( i.e . 25 patient treatment arm ) . Statistical analysis : The two group compare respect primary secondary endpoint . Appropriate statistical analysis use student test statistical difference crude rate grade 3 high toxicity two treatment arm perform . All endpoint analyse crude event rate 95 % confidence interval group . With sample size 50 patient , trial power detect difference incidence common self-limited side effect adverse reaction compare standard therapy . For reason , trial 's limited power augment Trial Safety Committee ( TSC ) bound rule require suspension/ termination trial accrual event major complication ( See Section 8.3 Data Monitoring - Human Ethics Application Clinical Study Part I : Section 5.3 page 11 protocol ) .</detailed_description>
