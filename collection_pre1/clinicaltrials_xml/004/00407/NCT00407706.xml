	<brief_summary>In previous research , show woman breast cancer population lymphocytes recognize specific antigen cytoplasmic matrix go physical change short time exposure vitro antigen . This change measure polarization change fluorescent light emit FDA ( fluorescein diacetate ) label cell . Further test perform show difference also show benign situation know indicator high risk develop breast cancer within 10-15 year . The incidence expression lymphocytes correlate histopathological picture relate high risk develop disease . In work expand scope procedure early detection cancerous process breast lesion Fitzgibbon 's risk category development invasive carcinoma breast . In proposed work intend use specific antigen MUC1 breast cancer . This study continuation publish work `` The Breast ``</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women carry benign breast lesion divide analyzed accord Fitzgibbon 's risk category invasive cancer risk ( 4 ) . The Fitzgibbon 's category : 1 . No increased risk group include adenosis ( sclerotic ) , duct ectasia fibroadenoma without complex feature , 2. slightly increase risk group ( 1.520 time ) include fibroadenoma complex feature , moderate florid hyperplasia without atypia , sclerosing adenosis , 3. moderately increased risk group ( 4.05.0 time ) include atypical ductal lobular hyperplasia 4. markedly increase risk group ( 8.010.0 time ) include ductal lobular carcinoma In Situ Following blood collection , detailed relevant clinical information patient register case record form . The data include : age , country birth , last menstrual period , lactation , number child , age first fullterm pregnancy , age onset menopause , family history , medication , mammography finding , FNA result , tumor size , histological finding , biopsy , disease staging , relevant clinical information . 1. pregnancy , 2. experience menstruation , 3. hormonal drug treatment .</criteria>
