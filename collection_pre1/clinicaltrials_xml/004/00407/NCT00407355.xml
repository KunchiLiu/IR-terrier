	<brief_summary>Central branch retinal vein occlusion major cause visual loss . Hemorrhage capillary nonperfusion , involve macula , contribute visual loss , major cause macular edema . Focal grid laser photocoagulation sometimes provide benefit patient macular edema due branch vein occlusion , several laser treatment often need recovery vision slow incomplete 1 . Laser photocoagulation provide benefit macular edema due central vein occlusion 2 . Therefore , new treatment needed.The objective study assess bioactivity 3 intravitreous injection 0.5 mg 0.3 mg ranibizumab patient macular edema due central branch retinal vein occlusion correlate activity peak trough aqueous level . The purpose research protocol pilot study determine randomize placebo control trial warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study phase II , open-label study investigate bioactivity pharmacodynamics intravitreous ranibizumab subject macular edema due central branch retinal vein occlusion . This pilot study enroll 40 patient , 20 central vein occlusion 20 branch vein occlusion . Each patient receive three ( 3 ) injection 0.5 0.3 mg ranibizumab . The study consist 2-week screening period ( Days -14 -1 ) , 3-month treatment period , 9-month follow-up period . Consented subject enter 14-day screening period determine eligibility , include serum chemistry hematology test , urinalysis , pregnancy testing , macular thickness base optical coherence tomography measurement fluorescein angiography . Patients reduction visual acuity 20/40 bad due foveal thicken macular edema secondary central branch retinal vein occlusion meet eligibility criterion invite enroll study . Baseline foveal thickness OCT must least 250 um , often associate VA 20/40 bad provide sufficient thicken treatment effect easily detectable ( Nguyen et al . 2004 ) . Every effort make recruit enroll eligible patient men woman ethnic social background . It expect 40 study subject recruit 4-month period . Patients meet entry criterion able enroll study quota patient achieve . All enrol patient receive either 0.5 0.3 mg injection ranibizumab . Forty eligible subject provide informed consent one site ( Wilmer Eye Institute Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions ) enrol , 20 central vein occlusion 20 branch vein occlusion . In 2 group , 10 patient randomize 0.5 mg ranibizumab , 10 randomize 0.3 mg ranibizumab . Subjects identify recruited clinic population Wilmer Eye Institute , include Vitreoretinal Service Retinal Vascular Center , well referral physician community . Announcement study make throughout Wilmer Eye Institute , Johns Hopkins University School Medicine newsletter , pamphlet , clinical trial web site internet intranet system . Information study also send community physician well ophthalmologist often refer patient Wilmer Eye Institute . Every effort make enroll eligible patient men woman ethnic social background .</detailed_description>
