	<brief_title>Enzastaurin Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess efficacy enzastaurin hydrochloride , term 6-month progression-free survival objective tumor response , patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine effect prognostic variable , include platinum sensitivity , initial performance status , age , patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride 3 time day 1 daily day 2-28 course 1 . For subsequent course , patient receive enzastaurin hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 68 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
