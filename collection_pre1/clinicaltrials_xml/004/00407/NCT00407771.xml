	<brief_title>The Effects Tirofiban Diabetic Patients Undergoing Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Diabetes major risk factor coronary artery disease diabetic patient consider CAD equivalent absence CAD1 . The presence CAD diabetes make patient much high risk future morbidity mortality . Moreover , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) diabetic associate high risk major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) . Several study also suggest release cardiac biomarkers PCI procedure independent predictability bad prognosis term morbidity death . Furthermore , previous investigation suggest glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( GPI ) use routinely diabetics undergoing PCI due high propensity develop hyper aggregatory status procedure put high risk develop myocardial injury subsequent cardiac biomarkers release . However , recent investigation suggest high dose clopidogrel ( 600 mg give least 4 hour prior intervention ) protective Abciximab low risk patient undergo elective PCI 2 . Thus , high dose clopidogrel preloading without GPI become standard low risk patient undergo elective PCI . There limited data literature suggest routine administration GPI prior PCI diabetic patient high dose preloading clopidogrel actually beneficial . That trial undertaken . Experience high dosage tirofiban Several study perform follow completion TARGET strongly suggest 10 Âµg/kg bolus dose tirofiban inadequate3 . The TARGET dose regimen tirofiban inhibit 20 uMADP-mediated platelet aggregation 60-66 % 15-60 minute onset treatment test PPACK sample anticoagulant , result rapid tissue redistribution yield tirofiban plasma level 35-40 ng/mL4 . Abciximab , dose TARGET trial , produce 90-95 % inhibition platelet aggregation time period . This difference extent platelet aggregation inhibition propose reason procedure-related ischemic event occur among subject receive tirofiban TARGET trial . To date , several publish trial describe use single high-dose bolus ( SHDB ) tirofiban various clinical setting . Taken together , 600 patient receive SHDB tirofiban clinical trial without evidence great expect increase frequency bleed event thrombocytopenia . A variety clinical , angiographic , echocardiographic endpoint consistently demonstrate SHDB tirofiban superior placebo appear comparable abciximab . Two trial demonstrate dose paradigm SHDB tirofiban achieves comparable level platelet inhibition abciximab patient undergo PCI4 , 5 . The large experience publish Danzi colleague 554- patient observational study compare safety efficacy SHDB tirofiban PCI patient cohort PCI patient receive abciximab6 . Patients enrol sequentially : first 280 receive abciximab subsequent 274 receive HDB tirofiban . The incidence major bleed event access site bleed complication patient treat SHDB tirofiban less see abciximab . Moreover , point estimate incidence in-hospital 30-day major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) SHDB tirofiban group actually abciximab group ( 5.6 % vs. 7.1 % ; P=0.65 ) . This clinical experience suggest SHDB tirofiban , administered time PCI , safe produce result similar abciximab . Danzi colleague publish second clinical trial compare echocardiographic , angiographic clinical outcome 100 patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) treat SHDB tirofiban versus abciximab7 . There slightly great improvement echocardiographic outcomes patient treat HDB tirofiban compare abciximab . Angiographic clinical outcome similar two group . Again , incidence major bleed severe thrombocytopenia report either treatment group , actually less episodes minor bleeding patient treat SHDB tirofiban compare abciximab ( 4 % vs. 8 % ; P = 0.71 ) . In short , clinical experience demonstrate SHDB tirofiban , administered time PCI , comparable abciximab treat STEMI patient undergo PCI . A second STEMI manuscript describe study design demographic STRATEGY trial evaluate STEMI patient randomize receive either SHDB tirofiban + sirolimus elute stent abciximab + bare metal stent . This study confirm finding Danzi co-worker , also find SHBD tirofiban result result , compare patient treat Abciximab , trend towards low bleed rate SHBD tirofiban regimen8 The ADVANCE trial evaluate efficacy safety SHDB tirofiban compare placebo treat high-risk patients9 . The study enrol 202 patient either single coronary artery occlusion/diabetes , diagnose NSTEMI , multivessel coronary artery disease . This trial demonstrate statistically significant decrease 6-month MACE bailout GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use patient treat HDB tirofiban versus placebo ( 19.8 % v , 34.7 % ; P=0.01 ) . SHDB tirofiban show significantly reduce increase cardiac marker ( troponin I CK-MB ) associate ischemic event . Subgroup analysis show statistically significant decrease lower primary endpoint diabetic ACS patient treat SHDB tirofiban . Finally , major bleeding , need red blood cell transfusion , severe thrombocytopenia , significant difference even minor bleeding rate SHDB tirofiban-treated patient treat placebo ( 4 % vs. 1 % ; P = 0.19 ) . In summary , trial represent significant clinical experience demonstrate safety efficacy SHDB tirofiban administer time PCI . Mechanistic/Pharmacological rationale benefit expect The use Tirofiban , give single high dose bolus , expect act final common pathway platelet activation , thus completely bypass COX-1 mediate signal activation ( intracellular pathway Aspirin-mediated platelet inhibition base ) . The use SHDB Tirofiban result dramatic inhibition platelet activation compare patient treat aspirin clopidogrel alone , determine significant profound increase platelet function contrast TACTICS dose10 . Objective investigation The Ultegra RPFA automate turbidimetric whole blood assay design assess platelet function basis ability activate platelet bind fibrinogen12 . The Ultegra RPFA accurate precise conventional turbidimetric platelet aggregometry13 , recent study demonstrate measurement operator dependent influence concomitant medication , hematologic parameter , demographics14 . The objective proposal conduct pilot study examine platelet function use Ultegra RPFA diabetic patient undergo elective PCI treat tirofiban high loading dose ( 600mg ) clopidogrel versus high load dose clopidogrel alone . Additional assay flow cytometry platelet monocyte aggregation analyze similar fashion treatment . Baseline blood sample also assess lipid profile , Hs-CRP , FBS , renal function , liver function , CBC HbA1c . Null Hypothesis It expect tirofiban arm provide 90 % platelet aggregation inhibition compare Clopidogrel alone arm provide maximum 50 % platelet aggregation inhibition . Therefore , expect difference 40 % platelet inhibition anticipate pilot trial . End point The primary endpoint : To investigate magnitude platelet aggregation inhibition use SHBD tirofiban clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone randomization , 10 minute ( t=0 ) 8 hour ( t=8 ) post tirofiban administration . Observational point : 1 . The difference flow cytometry platelet monocyte aggregation two group . 2 . The incidence troponin T release 12 hour post PCI among two group . 3 . The difference mean troponin T group 12 hour post PCI . 4 . Major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) 24 hour 30 day post PCI . Follow-up All patient screen ( independent AR status ) clinically followed-up 1 month evaluate observational point . Study Design Procedures : Type study This randomize , open label , placebo control ( bailout tirofiban rescue ) single center study . Statistical Considerations Number patient The study enrollment stop soon total 44 patient randomized receive Tirofiban ( addition Aspirin , Heparin 600mg Clopidogrel ) vs. Aspirin , Heparin 600mg clopidogrel alone actually undergo PCI . Statistical Analysis Two analysis perform ; first base intention treat consider bailout tirofiban administration reflect actual treatment . Since primary outcome relate operator independent analysis platelet function , expect bias interpretation final result conclusion . Main Study Flow 44 Diabetic patient refer elective PCI randomize two group . Group 1 : patient treat GPI , Tirofiban ( 25mcg/kg 3 min bolus dose 0.15 mcg/kg/hr 12-24 hour ) , start immediately insertion sheath . Group 2 : patient treat equivalent placebo . All patient load 600 mg clopidogrel least 4 hour prior schedule intervention .</detailed_description>
