	<brief_title>Platelets Function Cardiovascular Events Patients With End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Platelets play important role cardiovascular disease pathogenesis atherosclerosis development acute thrombotic event . Their importance coronary disease acute coronary syndrome indirectly confirm benefit antiplatelet agent ( particularly aspirin , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ) disorder . Cardiovascular disease single best predictor mortality patient end-stage renal disease , account almost 50 percent death . Patients end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) increase tendency bleed due platelet dysfunction partly correct either hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis approximately two-thirds case . Currently scant data concern relation platelet function cardiovascular risk patient ESRD . Platelets , platelet product , thrombosis play important proximate causal roles occurrence acute occlusive vascular event MI ischemic stroke . The disruption platelet fibrin rich atherosclerotic plaque may lead enhanced platelet deposition , ultimately formation thrombus precipitate acute clinical event . The following observation compatible importance platelet thrombus formation acute ischemic syndrome : - Thrombus formation within coronary vessel acute precipitate event unstable ischemic coronary syndrome , document angiographic pathologic study . Among patient sudden death due coronary thrombosis , thrombus typically layered appearance indicative episodic growth . Episodic growth may alternate intermittent fragmentation thrombus , lead distal embolization thrombus platelet aggregate microinfarction . - Increased platelet-derived thromboxane A2 prostaglandin metabolite find patient acute myocardial infarction unstable angina , provide biochemical support platelet activation cause event . - Patients unstable angina elevated level P-selectin , integral membrane protein involve platelet adhesion . Pulsatile shear stress , occur stenotic artery , cause platelet aggregation via increased expression P-selectin . Hydrodynamic shear stress , result plaque rupture , activate platelet cause platelet aggregation ( via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa von Willebrand factor ) platelet-mediated neutrophil aggregation via upregulation P-selectin . Although level P-selectin decrease first month treatment , level remain high normal even therapy glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor , suggest continued platelet activation . - Aggregating platelet patient acute coronary syndrome produce less nitric oxide patient stable angina . Why might occur know , impaired nitric oxide production enhance platelet aggregation thrombus formation . Another platelet-related factor believe contribute cardiovascular thrombosis presence large , reactive platelet patient acute ischemic event ( 19-21 ) . The increase platelet size , compensation persistent decrease platelet count , result ongoing consumption platelet unstable angina ; see acute myocardial infarction . In addition , platelets patient unstable angina , determine study platelet aggregability ex vivo , hyperaggregable . These effect promote thrombus growth , limitation blood flow , acute ischemia . Except important platelet occlusive vascular event several study suggests may also role evolutionary phase atherosclerotic plaque . After adhesion expose subendothelium follow endothelial injury release vasoactive substance induce smooth muscle cell migration proliferation . Platelets may serve lipid source development fatty streak promote foam cell formation even absence hyperlipidemia . However , currently clear clinical evidence platelet contribute coronary atherosclerosis . In addition , prophylactic therapy aspirin clearly show decrease atherosclerotic burden . ESRD associate prolongation bleeding time due primarily impaired platelet function . It likely multiple factor responsible platelet dysfunction uremia . Three factor may contribute retention uremic toxin , anemia , nitric oxide . - Uremic toxin – The importance circulating toxin suggest often beneficial effect acute dialysis platelet dysfunction , although bleeding time rarely normalize . In addition , raise BUN 60 120 mg/dL dietary manipulation diminish platelet adhesiveness prolong bleeding time normal subject . Urea alone , however , probably major platelet toxin predictable correlation BUN bleeding time patient renal failure . Other potential toxin include guanidinosuccinic acid , phenolic acid , middle molecule ( mol wt 500 3000 dalton ) . In vitro study normal platelet incubate uremic serum suggest dialyzable factor interferes bind fibrinogen platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor . In addition , uremic platelet unable adequately increase expression GP IIb/IIIa P-selectin response stimulation . - Anemia – Previously , anemia common find chronic renal failure . The degree anemia appear correlate relatively closely degree prolongation bleeding time . Furthermore , correction anemia blood transfusion erythropoietin often improve platelet function . It propose rheologic factor play important role relationship anemia platelet dysfunction . At hematocrit 30 percent , red cell primarily occupy center vessel , platelet skim layer endothelial surface . This close proximity allow platelet adhere form platelet plug endothelial injury . With anemia , hand , platelet disperse , thereby impair adherence endothelium . - Nitric oxide – Nitric oxide ( NO ; endothelium-derived relaxing factor ) inhibitor platelet aggregation produce endothelial cell platelet . Studies uremic patient show platelet NO synthesis increase uremic plasma stimulate NO production culture endothelial cell . The increase NO synthesis may due elevated level guanidinosuccinic acid , uremic toxin may precursor nitric oxide set . Although patient ESRD increase risk cardiovascular disease scant data concern cardioprotective effect antiplatelets drug primary secondary prevention population . In retrospective evaluation patient ESRD acute myocardial infarction , Berger et al . find aspirin underused population ( 67.0 % ) Similar result find McCullough et al. , . Balanced potential , unproven benefit aspirin patient ESRD potential risk , include bleed possible acceleration access thrombosis . The evidence accelerate dialysis access graft thrombosis base work Himmelfarb colleague . In trial aspirin appear increase relative risk ( RR=1.99 ) graft thrombosis . They subsequently demonstrate , vitro , aspirin enhance platelet-derived growth factor-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation . Adding clopidogrel aspirin hemodialysis patient associate significantly increase risk bleeding probably would result reduced frequency graft thrombosis . Although data concern aspirin primary secondary prevention cardiovascular disease ESRD patient sufficient efficacy well proven general population . Currently , seem ethical perform randomize placebo control trial evaluate antiplatelet protective effect patient . The purpose study perform prospective evaluation regard relationship platelet function cardiovascular event patient ESRD . Methods The study include 100-200 patient ESRD , age 18 year old , treat nephrology division Assaf Harofeh medical center . Patients exclude platelet count low 50,000 cu/mm , know hematologic malignancy , solid malignancy life expectancy le 1 year treat Warfarin ( Comadin ) . Patients sign write informed consent inclusion study . The primary end point study cardiovascular event include acute myocardial infarction ( define symptom + acute elevation TnI ) , need coronary artery disease revascularization , acute cerebrovascular event ( TIA CVA ) mortality . The secondary end point hospitalization due acute coronary syndrome , active bleed need blood transfusion dialysis access graft thrombosis ( time thrombosis ) . At begin study , blood take complete blood count include platelet count mean platelet volume , serum electrolyte , albumin , blood lipid , Kt/V , troponin two 5 ml aliquots blood collection separate stored -70co analyze oxidative stress , homocysteine highly sensitive CRP perform . Five mL blood send platelet function assessment ( describe ) . The follow period 2 year . During follow period , treatment aspirin clopidogrel give need platelet function assess change antiplatelets therapy . Patients treat aspirin , continue take medication dose change unless acute cardiovascular event active bleeding . Patients treat antihypertensive therapy , erythropoietin , calcium , vitamin D medication need . Platelet Function Tests Cone-and-Platelet Analyzer This technology describe elsewhere ( 40 ) .
