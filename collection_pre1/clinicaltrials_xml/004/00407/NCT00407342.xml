	<brief_summary>Alefacept new anti-psoriatic drug within group so-called biologics . In 30 % patient alefacept induces 75 % improvement psoriasis 12-week treatment period . The start anti-psoriatic effect alefacept delayed , however improvement psoriatic lesion outlasts end alefacept treatment . Narrowband UVB ( UVB-311nm ) phototherapy establish anti-psoriatic treatment regimen rapid onset anti-psoriatic efficacy disease-free interval end successful treatment course may short . Therefore , half-side ( left/right side ) comparison study aim investigate whether additional narrowband UVB treatment accelerate improve anti-psoriatic treatment effect alefacept .</brief_summary>

There new generation antipsoriatic drug specifically target T-cell mediate inflammatory pathway approve treatment moderate severe psoriasis United States . Alefacept ( Amevive ) one so-called biologics . Alefacept appear several advantage systemic antipsoriatic agent well tolerated patient . Weekly administration alefacept 12 week reduce psoriasis area severity index ( PASI ) great 75 % 30 % patient . The maximal antipsoriatic effect , however , apparently occur 12-week course end . In vitro study previous case report suggest alefacept 's antipsoriatic effect may augment administered combination UVB . These finding prompt u conduct prospective randomize half-body comparison study , ask whether clinical response psoriatic lesion alefacept could improve combine alefacept standard UVB 311nm phototherapy . Comparison : Psoriatic patient treat intravenous alefacept per week 12 week . One randomized choose body-half ( left right side ) additionally treat narrowband UVB ( UVB-311nm ) three time per week complete clearance psoriatic lesion UV-treated side .
