	<brief_title>Study Patupilone Prostate Cancer Patients Who Progress After Hormone Therapy Docetaxel Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common cancer diagnosed second common cause cancer death men North America ( Jemal 2003 ) . Many patient localized disease excellent long-term survival high cure rate standard approach ( D'Amico 1998 ) . However , patient high risk , locally advanced metastatic disease poor prognosis , although hormonal therapy form medical surgical castration induce significant long-term remission , development androgen independent disease inevitable . Androgen independent ( AI ) disease , also term hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) , clinically detect rise prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) worsen symptom . Once patient reach stage , therapeutic option limit prognosis poor Patients hormone refractory prostate cancer docetaxel chemotherapy limit treatment option treatment proven efficacious . Because mechanism action activity anti-microtubule agent combination general HRPC , patupilone potential therapeutic activity patient HRPC progress first line docetaxel chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must metastatic locally recurrent disease . Patients must document evidence PSA progression The PSA must &gt; 5 ng/mL time study entry . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week judgment investigator . Chemotherapy : patient must receive prior docetaxel base chemotherapy ( either single agent combination ) . Patients must evidence progression receive docetaxel base chemotherapy within 6 month completion docetaxel base chemotherapy . Prior adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy permit provided therapy complete &gt; 12 month prior registration . Prior therapy mitoxantrone experimental noncytotoxic chemotherapy permit ( e.g . monoclonal antibody , vaccine therapy , receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) . Hormonal Therapy : Prior hormone therapy permit . Patients must hormone refractory previously currently treat androgen ablative therapy ( medical surgical castration ) . Therapy LHRH agonist must continue prostate cancer patient already receive treatment time enrollment . If patient discontinue LHRH agonist , must restart castrate level testosterone must present . Patients must discontinue use nonsteroidal antiandrogens ( e.g . bicalutamide , nilutamide , flutamide ) least 6 week prior initiation protocol therapy . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation principal investigator . Prior strontium permit . Patients must less 30 % marrow bear area irradiate . Steroids : Current treatment steroid permit provide dose less equivalent daily dose prednisone 20mg . Laboratory Requirements within 7 day prior enrollment Hematology : absolute granulocytes ≥ 1.5 x 109/Lplatelets ≥ 100 x 109/Lhemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Biochemistry : bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x upper limit normal serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . Patients history invasive cancer , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 3 year . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Patupilone agent use study . Other serious intercurrent illness medical condition might aggravate protocol treatment include : myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry congestive heart failure unstable angina active cardiomyopathy unstable ventricular arrhythmia uncontrolled hypertension uncontrolled psychotic disorder serious infection active peptic ulcer disease HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . Patients receive treatment investigational agent anticancer therapy &lt; 21 day prior date protocol treatment . Patients receive anticoagulation warfarin ( Coumadin® ) . Patients grade ≥ 1 diarrhea .</criteria>
