	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking decrease life expectancy , cause devastate health complication , cost society billion dollar year . These untoward consequence especially pronounce among person schizophrenia ( SCZ ) approximately 80 % 95 % group smoke cigarette . These high prevalence rate underscore need research investigate determinant smoke patient SCZ . Several researcher observe nicotine improves specific symptom SCZ include negative symptom , negative affect , cognitive deficit . This led hypothesis patient SCZ smoke attempt self-medicate . However , mechanism ( ) nicotine positive effect symptom remain unclear . The current proposal posit neural inhibition ( NI ) physiological mechanism effect , variation alpha-7-nicotinic receptor subunit gene ( CHRNA7 ) represent genetic underpinnings process . The propose study ass NI symptom improvement acute administration nicotine smoker nonsmoker SCZ . In addition , NI CHRNA7 variation test predictor patient ' ability reduce/quit smoking follow smoking treatment . These data may lead development new pharmacological strategy treat symptom SCZ new method assist patient quit smoking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence smoking unusually high among patient SCZ . In light negative health , economic , social consequence smoke , treatment effort area imperative . Such effort rest , part , improve understanding underlying cause smoke within unique population . For example , several line research indicate smoke improves specific SCZ-related symptom ( i.e. , negative psychotic symptom , negative affect , cognitive deficit ) patient may smoke self-medicate nicotine . However , mechanism ( ) underlie effect unknown . The current proposal posit improve NI may one mechanism . More specifically , NI conceive mediator relationship smoke symptom improvement . Also , give propose mechanistic nature , believe nicotine-related change NI may predict quit/reduction and/or relapse rate follow smoking cessation program . Additionally , variant CHRNA7 likely represent genetic underpinnings decrease NI , vulnerability smoking , smoke treatment resistance among patient SCZ . These hypothesis support previous experiment suggest : ( 1 ) patient SCZ decrease NI ( Adler et al. , 1998 ) ; ( 2 ) nicotine administration ( via effect alpha-7-nicotinic receptor , , turn activate GABAergic interneurons ) enhances NI patient ( Adler et al. , 1998 ) ; ( 3 ) genetic variation alpha-7-nicotinic receptor increase risk smoke among patient SCZ ( Leonard et al. , 1996 ) ; , ( 4 ) high level NI associate few negative symptom , less negative affect , good cognition ( Yee et al. , 1998 ) . However , study hamper several methodological conceptual shortcoming include small sample size , presence confounding variable ( e.g. , effect nicotine withdrawal ) , limited test relevant symptom domain . Furthermore , previous study examine isolated aspect propose model , leave many central relationship variable untested speculative . The current proposal seek rectify methodological issue within context multidisciplinary scientific team . Globally , objective twofold . First , replicate extend previous finding nicotine cause symptom attenuation . Second investigate underlying neurophysiological genetic mechanism effect . The specific objective hypothesis address study follow : 1 . To acutely administer nicotine versus placebo smoker SCZ follow transient abstinence cigarette , order investigate effect nicotine SCZ symptom . This objective extend previous research employ adequately large sample simultaneously test several relevant domain symptom improvement . Hypothesis : Significantly great improvement across domain negative symptom , negative affect , cognitive deficit evident among patient receive nicotine versus placebo . 2 . To acutely administer nicotine versus placebo nonsmoker SCZ order investigate effect nicotine symptom SCZ , independent withdrawal . This objective allow methodological disambiguation direct neural effect nicotine effect termination withdrawal symptom . Additionally , provide seminal data regard acute treatment benefit nicotine therapeutic agent , deliver without health risk associate smoking . Hypothesis : Significantly great improvement across symptom domain evident among patient receive nicotine versus placebo . 3 . To ascertain ( use statistical technique outline Kenny others ) ( Baron &amp; Kenny , 1986 ; Judd &amp; Kenny , 1981 ) whether relationship acute nicotine administration symptom reduction mediate increase NI ( measure via ERP TMS paradigm ) . Hypothesis : NI meet statistical criterion mediate relationship nicotine administration symptom reduction . 4 . To ascertain whether nicotine-related change NI predict patient ' ability reduce smoking , amount nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) require , rate quit smoke relapse follow completion smoke cessation program . Hypothesis : NI operate significant unique predictor amount smoke reduction NRT use , well quit relapse rate , conventional predictor smoke reduction general population ( i.e. , age , marital status , cop resource , socioeconomic status , smoke related health problem , number cigarette smoke per day , concomitant alcohol coffee consumption , treatment compliance , stage change ) ( Matheny &amp; Weatherman , 1998 ; Ockene et al. , 2000 ; Oritz et al. , 2003 ) . 5 . To investigate whether polymorphisms CHRNA7 associate magnitude NI deficit , symptom reduction follow acute nicotine administration , rate smoke among patient SCZ , and/or quit/reduction relapse rate follow smoking cessation treatment . Hypothesis : Significant genetic association demonstrate CHRNA7 polymorphism above-listed clinical variable .</detailed_description>
