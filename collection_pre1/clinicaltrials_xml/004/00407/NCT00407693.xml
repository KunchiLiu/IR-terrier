	<brief_title>PET Whole Body Imaging Using Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor Ligand C-11PBR28</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) distinct central benzodiazepine receptor associate GABA ( A ) receptor . Although PBR initially identify peripheral organ kidney , endocrine gland lung , later study identify PBR central nervous system . In normal condition , PBR express low level neuron glial cell . PBR clinically useful marker detect neuroinflammation activate microglial cell inflammatory area express much great level PBR microglial cell rest condition . PBR image positron emission tomography ( PET ) use [ ( 11 ) C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) . However , classical ligand provide low level specific signal sensitive detect change occur vivo . Recently develop new ligand , N-acetyl-N- ( 2- [ ( 11 ) C ] methoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 ) , show much great specific signal [ ( 11 ) C ] PK11195 non-human primate . Therefore , [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 promise PET ligand . However , radiation absorb dos estimate human whole body image . The initial purpose protocol estimate radiation absorb dos [ 11C ] PBR28 perform whole body image study ten healthy human subject . The radiation absorb dos require apply PET ligand various neurological psychiatric disorder future . Under current protocol use [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , find healthy subject patient low bind [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 . We study approximately 188 subject total protocol use [ 11C ] PBR28 find 8.5 % ( 16/188 ) almost bind [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 . Several publish ligand test tested ligand recently develop show low affinity subset human . By use [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , need exclude PBR28 nonbinders data study change PBR . By use PET ligand bind equally PBR28 binder nonbinders , would able study subject . We also confirm PBR28 nonbinders determine PET show bind vitro binding assay use blood cell . We wish test new ligand currently develop chemistry group obtain blood sample additional PBR28 nonbinders ( = low affinity binder ) perform vitro binding assay . Because preliminary analysis whole body image show difference PBR28 binder nonbinders might somewhat vary among organ cause nonbinding phenomenon fully understood , identify PBR28 nonbinders bind assay , perform whole body image use [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 .</detailed_description>
