In order maintain scientific integrity Functional Assessment Questionnaire , certain non-identifiable information collect human subject . This information include : 1 . Age 2 . Sex 3 . Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) 4 . Peripheral Field 5 . Diagnosed Eye Condition Comparative statistical analysis perform Functional Assessment Questionnaire result widely use SF-36 ( 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument ) NEI-VFQ-25 Appendix ( National Eye Institute/Visual Function Questionnaire-25 ) questionnaires . The goal check questionnaire sensitive accurate measure functional level outcome prior ( low-functioning individual ) ( high functioning individual ) vision rehabilitation program participation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Between age 18 80 . Capacity complete inform consent process Legally blind ( best correct visual acuity 20/200 great , and/or vision field 20 degree less ) . Longterm shortterm blindness minimal vision rehabilitation . ( These consider lowfunctioning subject ) . Legally blind extensive vision rehabilitation , independent selfsufficient . ( These consider highfunctioning subject ) . Patients incapacitate physical mental challenge vision loss . Patients legally blind . Patients vision rehabilitation , thus fall highfunctioning lowfunctioning category .</criteria>
