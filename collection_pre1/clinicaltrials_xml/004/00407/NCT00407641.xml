	<detailed_description>Hemodialysed diabetic patient constitute high-risk subset patient develop cardio-vascular disease , account nearly 50 % death . In patient , mortality rate probably exceed 20 % per year . After stratification age , race gender , cardio-vascular mortality 10-20 time higher patient general population . Thus cardio-vascular risk factor patient manage early , aggressively multi-factorial manner order reduce high cardio-vascular morbidity mortality . Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) provide safe effective alternative UFH hemodialysis anticoagulation . While unfractionated ( UF ) heparin implicate hyper-lipidemia , effect LMWHs lipid profile non-diabetic patient chronic hemodialysis remain controversial . The effect LMWH diabetic patient , high risk group develop hyper-lipidemia cardio-vascular disease , study . The study intend examine long-term effect replacement UFH LMWH ( tinzaparin sodium ) cardio-vascular outcome lipoprotein profile large group diabetic patient stable HD . Tinzaparin sodium superior UFH term reduce cardio-vascular cerebrovascular outcome ( primary end-point ) . Tinzaparin sodium superior UFH term reduce specify lipid parameter stable diabetic patient chronic hemodialysis . A time-to-event analysis tool use record event rate . Accordingly , study aim enrol 200 diabetic nephropathy patient , allow 10 % drop-out rate , number evaluable patient study 180 . Therefore , primary triple end-point death/MI/stroke ( ischemic ) 180 evaluable patient , 80 % power ( two-sided alpha level 0.05 ) detect statistical significant difference 2 group rate event UFH group 30 % tinzaparin 13 % less . For secondary end-points cardiovascular morbidity mortality , assume event rate UFH group 50 % , statistical significance achieve rate tinzaparin group 30 % less . For difference average lipid value 2 group , 180 evaluable patient , 2-sided alpha level 0.05 80 % power , detect statistical significance difference : Total Cholesterol=19 mg/dL ( SD 46 ) , HDL-C = 4.6 mg/dL ( SD=11 ) , TG = 30 mg/dL ( SD=72 ) , LDL-C = 15 ( SD=36 ) ApoB = 13 ( SD=32 ) .</detailed_description>
