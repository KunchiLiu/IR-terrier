	<brief_summary>This project ass effectiveness use magnet reduce chronic lumbar pain . I understand I wear flex pad ( magnet ) waking hour keep daily Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) pain score determine wear device reduce constant pain . I understand adverse side effect know use magnet irritation site . The identical inactive pad ( sham/placebo ) supply use control . I randomly assign one two group I agree remain blinded specific type device I receive , i.e . active vs. placebo . Dr. Weintraub ( principal investigator ) remain blind throughout study . I also agree break blind . Dr. Weintraub state result cooperation ability complete study , I guarantee either keep specific device receive specific know `` active '' device gratis . This currently sell commercially $ 60 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double-Blind Placebo Study Magnetic Field Therapy Chronic Lumbar Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective study determine treatment flex pad impregnate static/permanent magnet penetrate 70 mm may improve quality chronic lumbar pain reduction pain score . HYPOTHESIS : It hypothesis application flex pad active magnetic therapy vs. sham utilized daily waking hour reduce back pain and/or radicular pain . The null hypothesis treatment subject chronic back pain exposure static/permanent magnetic field measurable effect chronic back pain score equal underlying placebo . SIGNIFICANCE : This low-cost , safe effective , non-invasive treatment musculoskeletal pain specifically chronic low back pain . An effective outcome would reduce dependency pharmacological intervention attempt reduction know side effect . DESIGN : This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study consist two treatment group . Treated subject receive static/permanent magnetic flex pad nominal strength less 1000 Gauss . Control subject receive physically identical flex pad without magnet nominal surface field strength 0 Gauss ( placebo ) . The magnet contain pad Velcro cover subject wear pad attach undergarments/skin waking hour . Dr. Weintraub examine participant initially look presence absence radiculitis , range motion , presence absence spasm , etc . The primary outcome measure reduction chronic low back pain comparison prior baseline score . It recognize change subjective nature . Patients maintain VAS score monthly basis end study , individual return form reevaluate Dr. Weintraub . They ask specific question regard PGIC bias , etc . PARTICIPANTS : Forty ( 40 ) outpatient chronic low back pain enrol . PROTOCOL : A DOUBLE-BLIND , RANDOMIZED , PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY ON MAGNETIC FIELD THERAPY TO IMPROVE CHRONIC LUMBAR PAIN INCLUSION CRITERIA : - Female male subject age 18-80 . - Capable understand comply study protocol . - Chronic lumbar pain least six month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : - Unable understand inform consent ( mental retardation , psychosis , communicative impairment ) . - Cardiac pacemaker mechanical internal device . - Tumor spine/history malignancy tumor . - Pregnancy . - Prior spine surgery .</detailed_description>
