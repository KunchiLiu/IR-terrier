	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Recurrent , Locally Advanced , Metastatic Cancer Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient recurrent , locoregionally advanced , metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium treat VEGF Trap . II . Determine time progression patient treat drug . III . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine tolerability safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
