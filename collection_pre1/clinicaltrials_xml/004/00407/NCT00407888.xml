	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy filgrastim together trastuzumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , filgrastim together follow paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation trastuzumab work treat patient breast cancer previously treat surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , Cyclophosphamide , Filgrastim Followed By Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation With Without Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess disease-free survival follow dose-intensive weekly regimen Adriamycin + oral cyclophosphamide augment G-CSF support follow Abraxane Herceptin appropriate adjuvant treatment high risk breast cancer patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity associate regimen . II . To assess deliver dose intensity regimen . III . To assess time treatment failure overall survival regimen . IV . To assess incidence severity delay nausea vomit regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive dose-intensive chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 10-15 minute day 1 , oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-7 , filgrastim subcutaneously day 2-7 . Courses repeat every 7 day 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 1 week later , patient receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute week 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients HER-2/neu positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
