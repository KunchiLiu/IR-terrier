	<criteria>A confirmed history retinitis pigmentosa ( center ) outer retinal degeneration ( France , U.K. , Switzerland , Mexico ) remain visual acuity bare light perception ( center ) 2.3 logMAR ( France , U.K. , Switzerland , Mexico ) bad eye . Functional ganglion cell optic nerve determine measurable electrically evoke response document light perception . A history former useful form vision worseseeing eye . Must least follow age time enrollment : 25 ( USA , Switzerland ) 18 ( France , U.K. , Mexico ) year old Must reside within 2 hour ( USA , UK Mexico ) 3 hour ( France Switzerland ) distance ( ground transportation ) investigational site . Must willing able comply protocol test followup requirement . Optic Nerve disease History glaucoma Optic neuropathy confirm damage optic nerve visual cortex damage Diseases condition effect retinal function include limited : Central retinal artery/vein occlusion ( CRAO CRVO ) Endstage diabetic retinopathy Retinal detachment history retinal detachment Trauma Infectious inflammatory retinal disease Diseases condition prevent adequate visualization retina include , limited corneal degeneration resolve implant . Diseases condition anterior segment prevent ability adequately perform physical examination include limited trauma lid malposition . Diseases ocular surface include limited keratitis sicca . An ocular condition predisposes subject eye rubbing . Any disease condition prevents understand communication inform consent , study demand , test protocol , include : Cognitive decline include diagnosed form dementia and/or progressive neurological disease Psychiatric Disease include diagnose form depression Does speak principal language associate region Deafness selective frequency hear loss prevents hear device alarm alert . Pregnancy Subject another active implantable device ( e.g . cochlear implant ) , form metallic implant head Conjunctival thinning may predispose subject conjunctival erosion area implant instal extraocularly . Subject participate another investigational drug device study may conflict objective , followup test study Any health concern make general anesthesia inadvisable . Subject unrealistic expectation implant . Known allergy contraindication anticipate preoperative , intraoperative postoperative medication . Conditions likely limit life le 1 year time screen . Diseases condition , judgement surgeon , impede ability implant device would prevent system function duration study ( e.g . strabismus ) Axial eye length &lt; 21.5 mm &gt; 26.0 mm implant eye measure ultrasound ( US )</criteria>
