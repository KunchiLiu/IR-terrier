	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate ( complete partial ) patient previously treat metastatic colorectal cancer treat VEGF Trap . II . Determine incidence disease stabilization , term 4-month progression-free survival , patient treat drug . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine median survival time patient treat drug . II . Determine 1-year survival rate stable disease rate patient treat drug . III . Determine response stable disease duration patient treat drug . IV . Determine toxicity drug patient . V. Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . VI . Determine change free VEGF Trap level correlate response toxicity . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients stratify accord prior bevacizumab treatment ( yes v ) . Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection begin course 60 day completion study treatment . Samples analyze immunoenzyme technique determine pharmacokinetics VEGF Trap . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 60 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
