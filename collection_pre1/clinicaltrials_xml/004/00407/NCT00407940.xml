	<brief_summary>The rise minimal access surgery herald approval number endovascular device similar indication . This particularly true treatment low extremity ischemia . Comparable device select patient use somewhat arbitrarily , often dependent industry influence . An unmet need NON-industry sponsor prospective trial COMPARING device head-to-head endovascular surgeon even contemplate evidence-based device selection . At present , seek compare two new high-technology device indicate treat lower extremity arterial stenosis associate claudication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ATHERO : Advanced Technology Halting Early Re-Stenosis Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease affect 12 million Americans , incidence grow annually . The male/female ratio patient claudication 2/1 . The artery involve atherosclerosis involve artery thigh leg . These include femoral popliteal artery . Fifty percent people femoral-popliteal PVD symptomatic . Symptoms typically related exertional fatigue thigh calf muscle . These symptom , refer claudication , seldom represent life even limb-threatening process . They , however , result significantly decrease productivity often devastate quality life . Traditional intervention low extremity claudication include technology invent first half 20th century include surgical bypass ; invent second half twentieth century , include balloon angioplasty stenting . These intervention substantial shortcoming . It , however , relevant note endovascular ( aka endoluminal endovascular surgery ) become increasingly popular gain wide-spread support vascular interventionalist society wordwide . The main shortcoming angioplasty stenting resultant inflammatory response . The mechanical injury blood vessel follow complex repair response comprise intimal vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) hyperplasia , vessel wall scar shrinkage vascular lumen , often result reduce blood flow subsequent muscle ( end organ ) ischemia . Rodent , rabbit large animal model provide valuable insight pathophysiology response . The device utilized protocol FDA approve procedure describe protocol . The device include Silverhawk™ System ( FoxHollow Technologies , Redwood City , CA ) PolarCath™ Peripheral Dilatation System , Boston Scientific , Natick , Massachusetts ) . Hereafter product refer “ Devices . ”</detailed_description>
