	<brief_title>Effect Weight Loss Prostate Cancer Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic , major public health concern , significant risk factor progression mortality prostate cancer . Prior work investigator ' laboratory pre-clinical prostate cancer model obese men find low fat diet , exercise , weight loss result antiproliferative pro-apoptotic effect prostate cancer tissue mechanism relate IGF-axis . The investigator propose conduct prospective , randomized clinical trial overweight obese men prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy evaluate weight loss prior radical prostatectomy result antiproliferative pro-apoptotic effect prostate cancer tissue . The investigator accomplish aim enrol overweight obese men prostate cancer schedule undergo radical prostatectomy . Following informed consent , men randomize either immediate radical prostatectomy 8-week weight loss intervention group undergo diet exercise weight loss program follow radical prostatectomy . Proliferation apoptosis prostate cancer cell prostatectomy specimen compare group relative baseline prostate needle biopsy specimen . Further study evaluate potential serum surrogate biomarkers investigator develop investigator ' laboratory ( ex-vivo serum bioassay ) serum tissue IGF-axis protein previously relate obesity , weight loss , prostate cancer progression . The goal investigator ' project evaluate potential anticancer effect weight loss prostate cancer tissue identify surrogate serum biomarkers reflect antiproliferative pro-apoptotic tissue effect apply future secondary prevention trial overweight obese prostate cancer survivor .</detailed_description>
