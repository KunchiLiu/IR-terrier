	<brief_title>Lamotrigine Alone Compared Lamotrigine Plus Antidepressant Treatment Bipolar II Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : To evaluate efficacy safety lamotrigine add antidepressant medication , versus lamotrigine monotherapy , treatment prevention major depression patient Bipolar II Disorder respond antidepressant treatment alone . HYPOTHESIS : Our primary hypothesis depress patient Bipolar II Disorder use lamotrigine plus antidepressant , compare use lamotrigine monotherapy , experience great decrease score Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , standard measure severity depression . The investigator also hypothesize patient use lamotrigine combination antidepressant great survival time without experience depress , manic , hypomanic episode maintenance therapy , improve quality life , compare receive lamotrigine monotherapy . JUSTIFICATION : Bipolar Disorder severe recurrent psychiatric illness associate high rate mental health service utilization functional disability . 15 % - 20 % patient complete suicide , great rate psychiatric illness . With lifetime prevalence 3 % - 5 % , one million Canadians suffer potentially disabling condition . Bipolar I Disorder characterized one manic mixed episode , frequently combination episode depression . It well study , effective treatment available depressed , manic , maintenance phase condition . Bipolar II Disorder consist period depression , plus one hypomanic ( mild manic ) episodes . The depressed phase Bipolar II illness overwhelmingly responsible substantial burden . Long-term follow-up study demonstrate patient experience depressive symptom almost 40 time often symptoms hypomania , even mild depressive symptom associate significant functional impairment . Hypomanic episode , conversely , generally short , infrequent , significantly impair function . Bipolar II Disorder under-recognized , primarily due frequent misdiagnosis Major Depressive Disorder . However , become increasingly clear common Bipolar phenotype , affect 80 % people Bipolar illness . Underestimation prevalence lead understudied . To date , large randomize controlled trial exclusively involve Bipolar II patient publish . Clinical decision regard treatment Bipolar II Disorder must therefore extrapolate research Bipolar I patient , base result small open label study . Clinical trial Bipolar I sample show conclusively mood stabilize medication Lithium optimal treatment , antidepressant therapy may potentiate switch mania , development rapid cycling course illness . Several line evidence , however , include genetic , family , long-term follow-up study , suggest Bipolar II Disorder distinct illness Bipolar I Disorder . Making treatment decision base data Bipolar I patient may therefore inappropriate . While open-label study support efficacy mood stabilize medication Bipolar II Disorder , others suggest Bipolar II patient may respond antidepressant monotherapy . Antidepressants may less effective treat Bipolar II Disorder Major Depressive Disorder , however , Bipolar patient over-represented treatment refractory population . In clinical practice , combine antidepressant mood stabilize medication commonly use approach treat Bipolar II depression . Lamotrigine mood stabilize medication demonstrate efficacy treat depressed phase Bipolar I Disorder , though study produce positive result . Therefore , current study compare efficacy safety addition lamotrigine antidepressant medication , versus switch antidepressant lamotrigine monotherapy , treatment Bipolar II depression respond treatment antidepressant medication . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate efficacy lamotrigine combination antidepressant medication , versus lamotrigine monotherapy , 8 week treatment major depression patient Bipolar II Disorder . The investigator also compare response remission rate depressive symptom commonly-used metric depression severity ; effect quality life ; level patient acceptance ; safety tolerability two treatment arm . A 44-week maintenance phase assess efficacy two treatment arm prevent episode depression , mania , hypomania . RESEARCH METHOD : This randomize , single-blind , parallel-group study compare addition lamotrigine antidepressant medication , versus lamotrigine monotherapy , treatment Bipolar II major depression . Approximately 100 patient randomize . During screen phase , informed consent obtain , patient eligibility assess , previous psychoactive medication discontinue period least five half-lives . A baseline psychiatric assessment complete , include relevant clinical scale , physical examination , protocol-required laboratory investigation . Patients meet eligibility criterion enrol study randomize one two treatment arm baseline visit . One study group receive lamotrigine 100-400 mg daily plus antidepressant medication , receive lamotrigine 100-400 mg daily monotherapy . Study visit occur baseline week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . Psychiatric status assess interview , information regard symptom depression hypomania specifically obtain use clinical scale . Overall quality life assess baseline endpoint use validated instrument . Adverse event , include mood switch mania hypomania , enumerate . Study endpoint occur week 8 , patient withdrawn study due non-response , adverse event , reason . Subjects meet protocol-defined criterion treatment response offer opportunity continue assign treatment 44-week maintenance study phase . Subjects assess every 4 week study period . At visit , information collect regard symptom depression , mania hypomania , overall psychiatric status , adverse event . Medication adherence assess visit . Assessment quality life , physical examination , laboratory measure perform endpoint . SUMMARY : This 52 week study efficacy safety lamotrigine plus antidepressant , versus monotherapy lamotrigine , treatment major depression patient Bipolar II Disorder respond antidepressant treatment . The study 4 phase : screening , enrollment , acute treatment , maintenance treatment . Diagnosis Bipolar II Disorder confirm clinical interview , accord DSM-IV-TR criterion . Presence severity depressive symptom assess Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Subjects confirm Bipolar II Disorder , MADRS score least 18 , exclusion criterion , eligible participate study . Subjects provide write informed consent enter screen phase . During screen phase , demographic information include age , ethnicity , psychiatric medical history , family psychiatric history , previous medication trial collect . Vital sign weight record , blood work hematology , serum chemistry , fast glucose , thyroid function , urinalysis , urine toxicology , pregnancy test , appropriate , collect . A physical examination perform . Clinical rating scale administer , include MADRS , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Disorder ( CGI-BP ) Severity Change Scales . Psychotropic medication allow protocol taper discontinued period least 5 half-lives baseline visit . Subjects continue meet inclusion criterion screen phase randomize study medication baseline visit . At baseline visit , clinical rating scale readministered . Quality life measure Quality Life , Enjoyment , Satisfaction Questionnaire ( QLESQ ) . Subjects randomized one two study arm baseline . Those first treatment arm prescribe lamotrigine addition antidepressant medication prescribe prior study entry . Subjects second treatment arm discontinue antidepressant prescribe lamotrigine monotherapy . Lamotrigine initiate 25mg daily two week , increase 50mg daily one week , increase 100 mg daily . The dose may adjust upward downward 50-100mg weekly , investigator 's discretion , provide remains within protocol define range 100mg - 400mg daily . For subject combination therapy arm , antidepressant dose remain constant throughout study . Treatment prescribe open-label fashion , subject assess investigator blind treatment assignment . Study visit acute treatment phase occur baseline , week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . At visit , patient undergo review study medication treatment , include pill count . Adverse event record . Presence severity symptom assess visit via MADRS , YMRS , CGI-BP . Weight vital sign measure visit . At study endpoint , quality life reassess QLESQ , laboratory measure , include serum pregnancy test , repeat . Endpoint reach study week 8 , subject investigator withdraws subject reason . The primary outcome measure acute study phase change severity depressive symptom , determine change MADRS score baseline endpoint . Secondary outcome include rate response treatment ( defined 50 % decrease MADRS score ) ; remission rate ( define MADRS score &lt; 8 ) ; average time response remission ; induction mania hypomania , measure change YMRS score ( hypomania define YMRS score &gt; 10 15 mania define YMRS &gt; 16 ) ; rate adverse event , measure patient report , change vital sign , weight , laboratory measure ; improvement quality life , determine change QLESQ score ; study completion rate . Subjects meet criterion remission endpoint acute study phase offer opportunity continue assign treatment 44 week maintenance phase . The dosage lamotrigine may adjust discretion investigator , must remain range 100-400 mg daily . No adjustment may make antidepressant dose subject combination therapy arm . Study visit occur every 4 week 44 week . At visit , MADRS , YMRS , CGI-BP administer ; weight vital sign measure ; adverse event record ; review medication pill count perform . The QLESQ laboratory measure repeat endpoint . The primary outcome maintenance study phase survival time emergence depress , manic , hypomanic episode . Secondary outcome measure include survival time study withdrawal reason ; frequency severity side effect ; overall psychiatric status determine score CGI-BP ; quality life , determine QLESQ score . Experimental aspect study include use lamotrigine antidepressant treatment depression patient Bipolar II Disorder , neither medication approve use Canadian health authority . While random assignment patient study group may also consider experimental approach , lamotrigine monotherapy combination lamotrigine antidepressant medication commonly use approach treat Bipolar II Disorder clinical practice .</detailed_description>
