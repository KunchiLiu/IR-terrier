	<brief_summary>Outbreaks skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) relate community associate Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) become increasingly common military train unit . Risk factor MRSA relate SSTI crowding , poor hygiene share equipment often hard avoid military training environment , often design simulate battlefield condition . It recently demonstrate military recruit colonize MRSA may increase risk develop SSTI . Studies hospital environment show decolonizing inpatient know carry MRSA decrease rate MRSA related infection treat individual also inpatient unit whole . The investigator propose randomize , double blind , placebo control trial : 1 . Evaluate effectiveness , feasibility , safety chlorhexidine body cloth , self-administered three time weekly , prevent SSTI among recruit military training facility ; 2 . Evaluate effectiveness chlorhexidine body cloths decrease rate Staphylococcus aureus colonization among military recruit .</brief_summary>
