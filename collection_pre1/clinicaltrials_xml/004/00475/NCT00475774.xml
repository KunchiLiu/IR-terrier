	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study examine effect body fat distribution physiological response dietary fat intervention . Physiological response evaluate fatty acid kinetics ( plasma subcutaneous fat appearance ) . Secondary objective target protein production ( apoB adiponectin ) . Examination effect chain length dietary fatty acid fat tissue characteristic effect chain length satiety , study well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The increase prevalence obesity relate risk metabolic disease result increased interest prevention obesity life-style intervention . The site fat storage ( visceral subcutaneous ) consider relevant term risk metabolic disorder . The type fat consume may determine storage either fat storage site hence relate metabolic disorder . Long-chain fatty acid suggest preferentially target subcutaneous fat , whereas medium chain fatty acid may preferably target visceral fat depot . Objective : The primary objective examine effect body fat distribution physiological response dietary fat intervention . Physiological response evaluate fatty acid kinetics ( plasma subcutaneous fat appearance ) , target protein production ( apoB adiponectin ) satiety . Study design : The study design randomize , double-blind , cross-over trial . Two treatment supply three week , wash-out period least 3 week in-between . Study population : Twelve apparently healthy overweight/obese men ( 30-60 year age ) BMI 27-35 kg.m-2 ( 6 upper body obese ( high WHR ) en 6 low body obese ( low WHR ) ) . Intervention : Three week intervention fat replacement contain long chain fatty acid three week intervention fat replacement contain medium chain fatty acid . The margarine replace normally consume margarine . Consumption take place breakfast , lunch dinner . Main study parameters/endpoints : On last day treatment period subject come TNO evaluation effect dietary intervention fat metabolism fat tissue . This examine stable isotope technique fat biopsy subcutaneous fat . At baseline subject total body scan MRI characterize body fat .</detailed_description>
